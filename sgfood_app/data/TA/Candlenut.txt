It's a cosy restaurant with three restaurants in one building. The candlenut is the only one of them with the Michelin Star. Typical local, spicy and very delicious food. Service is more than friendly...prices okay. A restaurant you should try to relax & enjoy.
5
We had the omelette, ngoh hiang, beef rendang, buah keluak fried rice, buah keluak ice cream and chendol. 6 stars service from Geley.
5
Couldn’t get a table at Candlenut for dinner on Valentine’s Day, so we chose to visit at lunch. We weren’t disappointed! The service was impeccable and the food absolutely delicious. Started by sharing the Wing Bean Salad, followed by Tiger Prawns and Red Snapper for entrees. Dessert was a citrus sorbet of sorts that finished the meal perfectly. A restaurant not to be missed!
5
Was brought here for dinner and thoroughly enjoyed the whole experience. The food was exquisite and I loved every single dish that we had. From the melt in your mouth rendang, to the curry crabs, chap chai, four vegetables and the yummy Chendol. I'm definitely coming back again with a hungry stomach.

This is an example of a restaurant where the food didn't disappoint. However, pretty much everything else did, which makes for an underwhelming experience. The food was indeed delicious, but the lack in service, atmosphere and wine selection means there are much better choices in Singapore.
5
Was here on a wedding party, the atmosphere is great with excellent peranakan food. The service is excellent with glasses being refilled very quickly. Food is cooked to perfection. To be honest it is my first luxury peranakan fine dining experience. Who could argue with a wagyu beef rendang and lobster laksa? Area is far away from the hustle and bustle of Singapore city not a problem with Grab/Uber

In Singapore there is always a select, but rapidly changing, set of venues where one goes to be seen and to entertain business associates. Currently the Candlenut Restaurant is one and highly suitable because it offers a sanitized simulacrum of peranakan food. As another reviewer rightly noted, it is safe fusion cuisine, adapted neatly to its international clientele, without placing any unexpected demands on them that the complex gastronomic experience of peranakan food actually involves. So, it is little surprise that it gained a Michelin star. It fits the European imagination of what exotic Asian food should be all about; but is likely to leave those who know peranakan cuisine feeling underwhelmed. To give examples, we tried their Buah Keluak of Braised Chicken (Ayam Buah Kelak), because this is usually a good litmus test of serious peranakan food. It was a remarkable achievement to make the intense flavours of Keluak nuts so extraordinarily bland. Much the same could be said of the Sambal Indian Lady’s Fingers with Dried Shrimp, which ended up tasting anaemic, as it had been domesticated to the point of being insipid. That said, the Baby Squid in Squid Ink and Tamarind was delicious, but was fusion rather than peranakan cuisine.If you want to be seen to be dining smartly on local food without the hassle of actually having to eat it, then the Candlenut is the place for you. If you are looking for peranakan food, go elsewhere.Incidentally, it gives an intimation of the style of restaurant that we were advised that the reservation would be held for only fifteen minutes. If we were later than that, we would lose the table. So, it would be wise to bear that in mind if the traffic is heavy

Probably one of the top 10 restaurants I have dined at in my travels around the world. We had the tasting menu, which was exceptionally delicious. The setting is modern but unassuming, the service was flawless and Felix’ knowledge of the dishes that were presented simply brought the experience to a whole other level. Don’t miss the duck curry, it is out of this world.Thank you for making this evening enjoyable on all fronts
3
Lovely and clean restaurant in a beautiful setting. Set menu is an idea to try varieties of Peranakan food. Food was good but nothing “wow”, service was friendly but not the best Peranakan food we have ever tried
3
We couln't understand the Michelin rating: the food is fusion, don't be mistaken. If you are a hardcore Peranakan then DON'T eat there, you will be sorely disappointed. The ayam buah keluak was so salty, you needed a plateful of rice just to eat it. The buah keluak has been scooped out from the shell and I estimate that there were 2 nuts worth but it was indistinguishable from the gravy and could easily be missed. The squid was unevenly smoked - pity. The rendang used wagyu beef - why? Though the rempah was good, it killed the taste of the wagyu, so a total waste of money. The barramundi was of good quality but the sauce tended to be altered for non-baba palettes and a bit watery. The sweet potato leaves are pretty much the only OK item. Nothing Michelin about it. Oh, and the $2/plate of belacan is worse than ridiculous: it's the size of a 50 cent coin and had to much belacan in it. I couldn't taste the chilli. Dessert was disappointing too. Although the banana cake tasted like banana cake, the fusion aspect of the chendol was more an example of when one runs out of ideas. So sad. The decor was a but schizophrenic with one wall looking like a cheap restaurant with vases cut in half and stuck to the wall with badly arranged cheap plastic flowers. The service was either very good or non-existent. I can't recommend this restaurant in all honesty.
4
Great place, with great peranakan food. If only the portion can be more generous. Make reservation early, as the place gets crowded during lunch and dinner time.
3
Had a pleasant dinner at the Candlenut. The blue crab curry was quite meaty & flavorsome; unfortunately the sayor lodeh looked & tasted similar. Both dishes were rather salty. The Sambal red schnapper was good.Having been to other Peranakan or Nonya restaurants such as Violet Oon’s National Kitchen, which serves more “authentic” cuisine, don’t understand why this would get a Michelin rating.Service was efficient and friendly.
5
Chose this place for our anniversary dinner. Went with the tasting menu and were not disappointed. The service was amazing, explaining each dish and very politely compensating for my culinary ignorance when I asked if certain items were decorative or edible! Genuinely though someone taking the time to talk you through the dishes, show they care about the food and that you enjoy them in the right way to maximise your experience was great. Personal highlights were the duck meatball soup, the duck curry and the Buah Keluak ice cream. Would thoroughly recommend.

Came here with my customer to try for first time. When I made this reservation, they said at 645pm must be there and need to leave in 2 hours. I thought probably I booked late and they probably packed with guest. When I stepped into the restaurant , it was half empty and when I about to leave at 845pm. I saw only 2 to 3 tables occupied. Why a rush? Come to food, taste was excellent but food served cold and rice was like just gotten out from fridge! Being a Michelin star restaurant I felt disappointment. I also don't think the Chef understand the food need to serve hot for Peranakan food and rice must be hot or warm at least to keep the standard of what we used to eat in any Peranakan cuisine restaurant. Price is fair for such high end local cuisine but probably you can eat at other choices of Peranakan cuisine in singapore and food probably the same. Wine selection was decent but don't expect great ! If you get to try high end Peranakan food, do try but I won't come back for sure. Good luck..
4
Great location, very well appointed dining area. It is a high end restaurant with a Michelin Star.Service was quite quick. But, lacking in warmth that one expects in such high end dining restaurants.As for the food, the menu was limited but every food item sounded yummy.Tried the pork satay, duck ball soup and the beef reading with brown rice. All the preparations were very delicious
5
The food, service and ambience were great. The food, while small portions, is so refined here, definitely worth the Michelin star.
4
I really enjoyed the high ceiling in this restaurant block that offers a very spacious feel. It was my first time at Candlenut and was not prepared for the small portions so I ordered just the three courses: Satay, baked fish and the coconut dessert. Both the satay and the fish were intensely flavoured, but not too spicy. The baked cod was just slightly undercooked. The coconut dessert really tasted coconut. I only wished that there had been some indication of the size of the portions or some tips from the waiting staff, in which case I would have ordered five or six courses. Another alternative would be having different sizes for the food meant to be served as main course, so that the guest may choose whether to have two small or one normal-sized
1
Having eaten here twice before with generally good experiences, we came back for my father-in-laws’ birthday on 26/12, 5 of us, and ordered the Omakase menu at $88 each. The menu included tiger prawns, 3 of us ate the prawns and came down with terrible food poisoning (the other two, who chose not to eat them, were fine). Think 36 hours of violent diarrhoea, vomiting, stomach aches and fever...Normally you might expect some vouchers, or credit or something from a 1* michelin restaurant, however the restaurant has denied all responsibility....Fortunately we took the leftover prawns home and are in the process of having them analysed by an external lab, to find out what kind of nasty parasites we have consumed.Needless to say, we are never going back..
5
If this is your first time in Singapore and you want to start it slow with the new tastes, start here in a chillaxed atmosphere and experience great peranakan dishes. For the seasoned expert the new take on the dishes is interesting if you can step beyond the “but grandma made it like...”-reaction. We very much enjoyed food, atmosphere, service and speed of our dinner - worth it 
4
Decently done peranakan food place. Went for the ah-ma-kase for the few times I went. Most of the items are great but there was some misses.Generally it provide a good sampling of the food they make. Dessert was great though
5
This is a superb restaurant. The food is excellent. five of us dined here and we all enjoyed what we had ordered. For a Michelin starred restaurant the value for money is amazing. The indoor room is so well styled with a colonial look.
4
The overall interior decoration is really impressive - even late at night on a weeknight, it remained busy. Spacious enough with size-able floor space and ceiling. I really appreciate that.The service staff are very good and accommodating. The food quality is superb so is the presentation. Although maybe it is slightly small portion, nevertheless tasty Peranakan dishes. What I liked is their dessert especially their version of Chendol
2
Table of 4 for lunch. Very small portions served of very average peranakan food. Hygiene quality is doubtful as I feel the beef rendang was not proper for consumption as I am sick. Overly priced and very average food. Don’t waste your time there.
5
Even by Singapore standards, this restaurant is extraordinary. In its setting, its service and the great food. I was invited by friends and the five of us spent a great night of enjoying the local peranakan cuisine - rich in flavours, spicy and extremely delicious.The attention was super, and the setting spacious and original. Highly recommended (as is making a reservation)
5
The concierge at our hotel highly recommended this restaurant and after dining there we can understand why. The room is modern, casual and unpretentious and the food was delicious. The server was terrific and spent time with us making suggestions and answering numerous questions. We were so intrigued by the tasty winged (4 sided) bean that we asked our server about it after our meal. She rushed to the kitchen and returned with a raw one to show us what it looked like. The portions were small which was great as it allowed us to sample many dishes without any guilt. I highly recommend this restaurant
5
My wife and I ate here recently for lunch.The restaurant is airy inside and the staff very welcoming and happy to assist.This was our first venture into Michelin Star in Asia and we were hoping it would live up to the same quality we’d expect from a starred restaurant. It didn’t disappoint.Starters were perfect, not too filling but the main courses were well spiced and well balanced, delicious! I had the BBQ chicken which comes in a slightly spicy and sour curry sauce, not too heavy. My wife had the vegetarian Kang Kong curry! Towards the hotter end with an amazing flavour!Veggies would not be disappointed with the choices here and the restaurant were happy to adapt dishes for my wife too.Very reasonably priced and would definitely visit again. A must try in Singapore
4
We had dinner here, great & friendly service. We ordered a selection of smalls (octopus, pork neck), for mains (rendang, snapper grilled and king prawns. All dishes were very tasty and packed a punch. We enjoyed our visit and will be back on our next visit
5
Our daughter's recommendation turned out to be a complete winner. The area where this restaurant was is amongst green surroundings and manicured gardens. The Dodd was sublime and we loved the decor. We had an elderly gentleman waiter who made the night very special. Would highly recommend this place as a must see/go and eat
4
The restaurant is a bit outside of the actual city in a spacious area. The interior is modern. Music is pleasant and really at background volume. The menu gives a nice choice of meat and seafood, we had crab curry and beef rendang. Desert was durian ice cream, quite special. Service was good and prices reasonable, though not cheap. I don't very well understand the fuss about the reservation, the time slot etc, the place was less than half full when we were there. Maybe its different the weekends
4
So we went there not knowing what to expect. I personally had no idea how traditional Chinese should taste.Now I do.If you try the tasting menu you are home free, you wont miss anything. In it I want you to specifically try the Chef's grandfather's appetizer with crab. It was a good piece of Asia for my palate and I guarantee it will suit your taste buds as well
5
Fantastic food in a lovely space. The tasting menu was a good selection of taste and quantity. I visited with 2 locals and they were pleased with the experience. The service can use a bit of polishing considering the caliber of the establishment.
4
The ambience is outstanding. Warm lights bathe the dinners from the hanging ceiling lamps and the temperature was perfect for spicy dining. The buah keluak is available in many forms and we particularly loves the BK fried rice and BK otah! Mind-blowing stuff. We need to visit a few more times to try the entire menu. Service was exceptional with at least two waiters per table. Thumbs up!!
3
Michelin stared restaurant but very average at best. Can find better peranakan food in Singapore at cheaper price
4
The mysteriously named Candlenut offers an equally cryptic Straites menu. Very regional (and seasonal) food elevated to fine cuisine, in a inspiringly converted colonial drill-hall. The chef takes simple ingredients and through alchemy creates magical fusion. Will return soon. - Ben Clark, Deputy Chairman, Christie’s Asi

Old meets new in this renovated warehouse, once used to house Singapore's law documents. Now it is segmented into a trio of customer friendly spaces: two restaurants flanking a centrally located and elegant dry goods grocery. Candlenut offers the complex flavors of Peranakan cuisine, very well prepared and presented, and at top end pricing as well. Overall, an upmarket place and experience, with equally well trained staff and appealing, thoughtful design, wherever you glance
5
I first realised how difficult good Peranakan food is to make when I attended a cooking class for a simple rice dish (nasi ulam). Peranakan food is, at source, already refined because of the delicate balance of many spices carefully mixed by hand (mortar & pestle-style). The rubric of spice combinations for each dish is often also layered, not unlike the French style of cooking. I am so pleased to be blown away by Malcolm Lee, because he has (in my humble opinion) taken Peranakan food to a whole new level.The pork satay is one of the best I’ve ever had. The swimmer crab curry had beautiful flavours. Even the simple omelette dish was outstanding. The buah keluak fried rice was sublime. Desserts were interesting and the durian dessert was beautifully presented.For detractors who feel it’s too expensive, I say better try it now before the restaurant becomes even more famous. With their one star award, it won’t be long before it opens a presence in London and New York, and then it may be out of reach for many of us
5
I first came across Chef Malcolm Lee during a client event we had organised. It was a celebrity cook off with Chef Lee pitted against another very wonderful French Chef. The Peranakan cuisine dished up by Chef Lee blew me away that night and when one of our clients mentioned Candlenut, I decided it was the place we were going to celebrate my wife’s birthday. The place and ambience is lovely as the restaurant is nestled between lovely greenery almost taking you away from the urbanapolis that Singapore is. The service was impeccable, the Steward who looked after us was very knowledgeable about the cuisine and the dishes at the restaurant. The crab curry is without a doubt one of the best I’ve ever tasted in my life, the buah keluak(black nut) rice was very nicely done and for us was a pleasant surprise. Lastly the lemon grass chicken was a treat too, Peranakan style. The desert of caramel banana compote with gula Melaka ice cream was absolutely wonderful as was the chocolate cake that our Son chose.Yes, there is a bit about the Peranakan cuisine that it’s spicier than most cuisines and all the dishes certainly hinted at this trait more than adequately. It’s the only one thing I would caution people about. Otherwise this is a place to be savored and will make special occasions more memorable
5
The food in this restaurant is creative. It tastes different from most other Peranakan places. I liked the fact that the servings of each dish was small. We were able to try quite a few dishes. What impressed me the most was the ice kachang. It tasted very special. The service was also very good.The price of a meal is about twice of an average restaurant in Singapore. Given the quality and creativity in the food, I think it was very much worth it
5
We had a perfect opportunity to get acquainted with Peranakan cuisine in Penang, Malaysia back in 2014 and we lost it due to poor time management, so we were happy to get to know there's Candlenut in Singapore to close this topic.First tip - don't try public transportation to get there unless you really need to kill some time, as it takes about 40 minutes to walk from the rapid rail station to get there, use Uber instead, it's around 15 minutes to downtown.The interior is full of light, the ceiling is very high so lot of air. We considered taking the set but were afraid to miss something so took decent share of the menu.The service was somewhat slow, but not critically. The menu is very convenient as it lists all the main ingredients.We enjoyed the specialties of the Peranakan cuisine from starters to desserts and I had a nice craft IPA for it, so all in all I can only recommend
5
If you want truly amazing Peranakan cuisine than you have come to the right place. This one star Michelin restaurant had the best steamed Buah Keluak paste that is wrapped in banana leaf I have ever tasted. Yes the menu is pricey, but it was worth every penny. All the food that we choose was fantastic. If you want to tried something different, this would be my recommendation
5
I love this restaurant. The food is amazing, spicy flavours are delicious and the service is excellent. We were served by Michael and he was great. Thoroughly recommend this restaurant.
5
This restaurant serves Peranakan (straits chinese: a mix of Chinese and Malay food) but with a modern (novelle cuisine) twist. It has one Michelin star
5
very nice place, helpful and friendly staff, food was fantastic and décor is beautiful, garden too. highly recommended
5
This restaurant is out of town at Dempsey Hill, taxi around S$20.00 to get there. It is in an area that use to be one of the old British Army Barracks during the British running of Singapore.There are about 15 or so restaurant as well as some high end stores in this area. Not a large menu but varied enough to suit just about every one.As you would expect for a m/star restaurant, the serves of each dish are not large ,and sea food ones are up in the S$30.00 mark, wine also reasonable expensive. Had the wok fried Iberico pork, char grilled squid, swimmer crab curry. Satay order only consists of 4 skewers, but shared and was v/good,the wing bean salad also great. One desert I ordered looked strange but it was excellent , try it , Chendol.Great presence in the restaurant , bookings required, a great meal
3
Ngoh Hiang and iberico pork were my fav fishes. The prawn and crab tofu soup had very authentic and strong flavors but there was a slight bitterness that I have would preferred not to be there. The chap chye was average. Overall I would say quality is good but I find the portions rather small for the price. The iberico pork especially for $28 was only barely sufficient for 2 people.$90 for 2 mains, 1 soup and 1 appetiZer. I must applaud the service as they are extremely attentive, water constantly filled up, staff were pleasant. When the pork came out too spicy for me ( I had already requested less spicy when I ordered the dish) they took it back and made it less spicy no questions asked and made sure that I was satisfied when the dish came back the second time round.
3
Too spicy food, Peranakan food is obviously not my thing. Even my husband who is ok with the highest level of spicy food could not eat it. Nice ambience, beautiful place, but food is nothing special although nice presented.
5
Dining at Candlenut was my most awaited moment of this trip to Singapore and it did not disappoint at all.Most of the dishes we had were great but the standout dishes were the tiger prawns in gula melaka coconut sauce, blue swimmer crab curry, wagyu beef rib rendang, and the buah keluak. Not only was the food great but the staff were too, as well as the restaurant's ambiance
5
The food talks for itself. In it's variety, execution, presentation. The restaurant is very controlled which meant over fast service. But once mentioned it was no longer an issue. Tge food however, divibe and different. I also had the honour of meeting the chef. A culimary genius, but more, a special and gentle soul.
3
Im a Peranakan and i didn't feel that the food was much to shout about. The service and ambience was great though. their version of a Kir Royale was also nice. good range of wines etc. The Buah Keluak dessert was very good. The different textures and flavours really brought it together
4
You don't go to a michelin starred restaurant and not expect the best. Shout-out to our waiter (middle-aged Chinese uncle, apologies that I don't know your name!) for the lovely service. My favourites have to be the smoked octopus starter and crab curry main. The rest of the food was delicious too, but these 2 are above and beyond expectations. The only flaw was the shellfish bisque which was way too salty and really disappointing because the ingredients from the menu looked excellent. Thankfully, the rest of the menu more than make up for it. The chef also very generously gave us extra cakes at the end (can't remember the name but please refer to pictures) which was superb as well. Thanks candlenut for a lovely evening
5
We had the 88$ menu and we weren't disappointed. Great food really and the service was very nice and efficient. Don't miss the valrhona chocolate dessert.
5
The restaurant gives a great impression on arrival. It is fresh and nicely laid out. The waiter recommended the tasting menu and we were not disappointed. The starters and main courses had a wonderful mix of flavours with each mouthful revealing a different texture and revealing taste you were not expecting. Only disappointment was the soup but this was a minor complaint in a great meal. Well worth its Michelin star. Dempsey Hill is well worth a visit before or after eating.
3
I do not really understand why this restaurant is Michelin starred (except maybe for the prices). The food is good and service too prompt, which is quite common in Singapore. The location is nice and we appreciated the fact that the tables were widely separated. We tried four different desserts and all of them were disappointing... Stick to the main courses
3
I liked the fairly casual atmosphere. Prices (high) and portions (small) indicate a more upscale place -- I can deal with that, but the food was not up to expectations. Plenty of heat, but not a lot of flavor. Final verdict would be: meh. Do not repeat
3
Was expecting an experience that the prices suggested it should be, but such an anticlimax. From a terrible space to be sitting in, to all the food out in 45 minutes. And what's with the soup coming out with the mains.Food was ok but not spectacular. It was not worth the money at all
3
We booked here as it is Michelin starred. The food is very, very good. However, we were in and out in an hour - and that was having the full chef menu. The service is just too quick and clinical. I know this seems to be a Singaporean thing, as we had it elsewhere, but to be honest it killed the experience a bit. For the price, I would like to have a nicely paced dinner. Instead - everything was delivered together - soup and 5 mains all at the same time. It was odd. Food is fantastic, but as a 5 star dining experience, I found it just a bit too clinical - hence the 3 star rating.
5
This time I ordered ala carte.The swimmer crab curry was divine. The king tiger prawn curry was excellent too.The ngoh hiang was very good too with lean pork and mushroom.I was less impressed with kurobuta satay.The buah keluak valrhona ice cream and kueh salak were both excellent
4
It was 6 of us last Monday evening. When we booked our table, they asked us to have the 6.00/6.30 pm sitting. That was something we did not understand. As for the whole of the evening till we left at around 8.00 pm, he restaurant was only half full. They should have easily accepted our reservation for sitting at the table at 7.00 pm and asked us to vacate the table by 8.30 pm or slightly later. Some of our guests had to rush from work that evening in order to suit their request that did not serve any purpose. The restaurant was very nicely decorated and we particularly loved the hanging light fittings. The services were good but was slightly over as here were too many staff and the cloud was not there. We enjoyed the Wagya Beef Rendang, Buah Keluak Fried Rice, Buah Keluak Braised Chicken and Pork Neck Satay. They are all good. But the Buah Keluak taste may not to everyone's liking as it needs an acquired taste to like it. I was grown up in Hong Kong and it took me about 10 years for me to start liking it. Even nowadays, I still do not like similar dishes done in other restaurants when it's favour is too strong. We also order the Crab Meat Curry. We like the favour and it's taste. But the texture of the crab meat did not come out to our likings. May be if it is with prawn, it could have turned out to be a better dish. We did not like the grilled squid. For dessert, we like the Chendol with Pandan Jelly Dessert, but not the Hari Raya Special. The dish servings were small. As suggested by their staff, we order some 8 dishes for the 6 of us, mostly are generally small eaters as most of us are seniors.
3
Opted to go with the Sing$ 88 tasting menu in order to get a good variety of dishes. 3 appetizers, 1 soup and 5 mains and 2 desserts to share. The food is real good. Not too bold or spicy, more fusion than true Peranakan food. The only bad thing is that all the mains and the soup come out at the same time and the food ends up getting cold before you have a chance to savor all the dishes - 3 out of 6 ended up being cold, not good! I would have rated this place as excellent if it wasn't for eating cold food. Service very good and attentive. The atmosphere is light, bright and fun. Well worth a visit if you stay off the tasting menu
3
I brought my parents to candlenut for dinner as a treat. Although we enjoyed the food but I will agree with most reviewers that you can get better and cheaper elsewhere. The service though was excellent. The waitresses were well trained - attentive and very friendly. One took particularly good care of my parents. We had an enjoyable experience thanks to the young ladies.
4
Interesting fusion flavours but not sure that all of them quite work. Service was friendly and attentive. The food all came very quickly and the dishes were certainly different.
4
interesting food. Lighter and fresher than my previous impression of Nonya food. Nice venue. Service was a little slow but friendly.
4
High end local food but prepared in a gourmet way. Casual setting and comfortable place to go with friends or colleagues. Food to enjoy and share together.

I went there with a group of friends on Saturday 8th of July 2017, where we only managed to make a booking at the 10:30 pm slot. My missus and me arrived first at 10:29 pm while my missus best buddy arrived at about 10:46 pm.Between 10:29 pm to 10:46 pm, we were pestered to quickly place our order because the kitchen closes at 10:30 pm ?! Then why in the world are we accepted for the 10:30 pm slot?After her buddy had arrived, we were left to our own devices initially and I was questioned more than once by my companions on what to order which I am pretty much as clueless as they are.The staff didn't step in to give recommendations until I had raised my voice that I don't have any idea. I wonder where the Michelin Star service has gone to? Pretty much at this point, we felt first admonished for being stragglers and second not welcome with minimal assistance given. Needless to say, service to us is out the window by now.The food didn't taste that much over the top either. Perhaps you may say that it is affected by our mood. As a comparison case, I would have preferred to have my meal at True Blue restaurant located at 47/49 Armenian Street ( Peranakan Museum ) which tastes and cost similar but with more authentic ambience and better service
3
Went for dinner. Interior and deco were nice - very pleasant and relaxed atmosphere. Staff were polite and knowledgeable about the dishes too. What I liked a lot:- brown rice: so perfectly cooked that I could eat that on its own- blue crab curry - lots of crab meat. Curry also packs a punch in the flavour- wing bean salad: very good balanced with the sauce and very light and refreshingOther dishes ordered:- prawns: curry/ sauce was very very creamy- pork belly: not bad.. tender and tasty
5
We went to dinner last night 25 June 2017 and had a great meal in a great atmosphere. Although they were busy and booked out, we never felt rushed. Felix (like the cat he said) was charming, very helpful and could read our minds. Thank you Felix and crew for such memorable flavours and experience. Gary & Peter; Melbourne, Australia

There is 1 Michelin Star displayed at the shelve. This restaurant used to be at Dorset Hotel before taken over by Como Group. Ambient is nice though. We were billed Chap Chye which we were never served although we order 3 portions of each dishes. All guests totalled around 12 of us, non received the Chap Chye, my family loved Peranakan dishes, & Chap Chye have been a regular dish cooked at home, the serving staff at the end of the dinner were trying to show us how a Chap Chye looked like, & repeatedly came to us even though non of us saw or witness any of that dish serve, but the service showed extreme skepticism, even brought the manager out with disbelieve as they tried to show us that it was in the order & the bill. We would have otherwise enjoyed a wonderful evening with good company & laughter, and reasonably good food, but ended up with a sombre mood because of this "unserved" incidence.
4
We really enjoyed the location, simple decor...all dishes were delicious : king prawn petai, duck curry, rendang, ...had a nice Spanish white wine (pricey) and overall enjoyed it all. Service was very good until mid-dinner when it disappeared for a while (we had to stand up to get our bottle of wine and fill our glasses...)...will be back anyway.
5
Widely recognised as Singapore's premier destination for Peranakan cuisine, every visit to Candlenut reminds you why its Michelin star rating is well earned.The menu is familiar in feel and easy to navigate. You'll find something that whets your appetite almost every line and the cooking doesn't disappoint. Expect to be blown away by mouthfuls of umami but make sure to order an extra portion or two for your table. Plates and their portions for some dishes can be surprisingly small.Decor is rather simple and less extravagant in comparison to its fancier neighbours, but it's comfortable and charming enough to impress your date if it's a special occasion.

On the conclusion of our dinner on a weekday, I did a quick straw poll. Of the 6 of us (all of whom dined here for the first time), none of us would return. First, if we are looking for authentic Peranakan cuisine, Candlenut does not fit the bill. Although its dishes are said to be Peranakan-based, they are not pure Peranakan dishes. An obvious example is that genuine Peranakan cuisine does not use wagyu beef as a particular dish at Candlenut touts itself to. Another instance is the size of the servings – Peranakan dishes come in generous servings, whereas each Candlenut dish is small and intended for 2 persons at most. I think Candlenut cuisine should more accurately be described as Peranakan-inspired fusion Asian food. Secondly, if we are looking for real Peranakan cuisine, there are a good number of outlets elsewhere in Singapore. Thirdly, Candlenut is pricey. We were discouraged from ordering a la carte as the dishes – we were told – were too small for 6 adults. Instead, we were encouraged to order the set menu at S$88++ which was described as “A-mah-kase” i.e. Candlenut’s equivalent of the Japanese omakase (“as the chef pleases”). The bill, including still water and taxes, came up to more than S$100 each. For that amount, I could have a top-class eat-all-you-can buffet or feast elsewhere (without being limited to the 2 hours that Candlenut imposed on us for our dinner). The amount might buy you the right to brag on Facebook that you had dined at a Michelin-starred Peranakan restaurant, but that was about all there was to it. To me, it was simply not value for money

This was one of the nicest lunches. Service was good, wine was good, food was amazing. Decor set you in the mood for a great Sunday lunch in Singapore. I can thoroughly recommend candlenut for either lunch or dinner. Food is amazing. 🍷🍷

A table of eight with a couple of vegetarians. Fantastic tasting menu with the crab soup being amazing. Unfortunately the quality of the service is not up to par and a disappointment.

Credit where credit is due. On my first visit here about half a year ago, the food and service didn't seem too impressive. However on my second visit recently, the food was good and service also impressed. Particular service from an elderly gentleman waiter, which was top notch. Food is still slightly on the pricey side, but the setting and ambience are probably also factors in the pricing so overall it's still fine. Desserts here are really good.

Enjoyed the Peranakan food with modern twist. The kueh pie tee shell was a fresh rendition of an old Favourite. The Ngoh Hiang with prawn and water chestnut was light and crunchy. For mains, had Wagyu beef rendang, buah keluak local chicken and dragon vegetable. These dishes went well with the healthy brown rice. All were delicious but nothing really special.While the food was good, it was pricey. The chairs were not comfortable. And we had to cut our conversation as we were politely reminded that the next batch has arrived. First time I was rushed out of the Michelin restaurant!!!!There are other better options for Peranakan food
4
Place is a bit out of the way, so better take a taxi/uber/grab. It was already busy when I went there at 5.45. Service was top notch, very helpful & prompt. Because I was in a hurry, I only ordered the crab curry. Delish. Portion is very Asian. Free water, wifi available. Would come again to try their omakase

This restaurant is excellent in what it aims at - modern Peranakan cuisine. Yes it's original, yes it's authentic, yes it's updated. Great space, fitting the Dempsey context; I like the airiness and light. It compares very well to Violet Oon whose places seem more intricate and spacey; food is on the same level but here at Candlenut I had some of the best Newnya dishes ever. Service was very friendly and very prompt; in the old phrase, one couldn't fault it. (And read the reviews that complain about the service carefully - they are obviously written by people next to whom one really would not care to sit. Demending bigger wine glasses from a neighboring restaurant - oh Saints be blessed...)Of course the dishes we had were different in taste an quality level, but all were at least very good. The chicken satay was good but not a revelation (which of course a dish doesn't have to be), the blue swimmer crab curry was really excellent, the squid with squid ink was a revelation - absolutely amazing in texture, taste, and presentation; I can still reconstruct the experience - sublime! For desert, again excellent buah keluak ice cream and the very nice, refreshing textures of coconut. A nice Stiglbräu with it; I don't especially like wine with Peranakan food (both taste-wise and as it is a bit naff), and their beer menu is really good (we had Stiglbräu, if bottled). All this for two for less than SG$ 150.I'd come back in a jiffy. Excellent food nicely served in pleasant surroundings; what's not to love
2
Visited Candlenut a few times over the last 3 months; one thing remains consistent - awful service. It's a real shame for COMO branding. Very poor service and even ordering a drink needs a few reminders; I'm not exaggerating. Always walk out of the restaurant feeling somewhat lousy despite reasonable good food. I guess a good experience is not just about food but service plays a big part. What a shame!!!......

We were three people and when arriving I said to the hostess the booking name and said we would take a drink at the bar before coming to the table. The bar was at Como Dempsey right next to Candlenut. She replied that could only hold table for ten minutes. I considered that unfriendly and odd as it was already quite late and there were lots of empty tables at Candlenut. As for the food at Candlenut it was served and presented unimaginatively and the taste was rather insipid. I particularly disliked the wine glasses, as they were very small, so I requested that they serve the wine in the bigger wine glasses from Como Dempsey but waiter replied it was not possible as they are not the same restaurant. They were unaccommodating to say the least
3
Went there because a friend brought me here, so we tried some of the waitress recommendation but the food it's lacking the taste,it's missed something. In my opinion you come here to enjoy the ambiance but sorry not the food, thankfully their wine and the service was good

When the restaurant is described as the world's first Michelin starred Peranakan restaurant, it is without any doubt that expectations will be high. Unfortunately the entire experience of our dinner had already taken a negative turn before the food arrived. We asked for food recommendations and were recommended the ahmakase menu. We declined as we were not big eaters and wanted to reserve some room for dessert. The persistence and reluctance of the waiter to move away from the ahmakase was borderline impolite and it took several patient "nos" from us before we had recommendations on the mains. After ordering our mains, we asked to see the dessert menu. It arrived but before we could see it, the same waiter came to remove it. We stopped him, asking if he could leave one as we haven't seen it yet. The reply was we could see it later and he walked off. The behaviour was shocking to the point of it being funny as this was a restaurant that was supposedly the Peranakan restaurant to go to. Service through the night was personality specific and on the whole, cold and unapproachable. Food was good but nothing spectacular. The blue swimmer crab was pretty good and special but otherwise the other dishes tasted fairly conventional and ordinary. Desserts was disappointing. Both the buah keluak ice cream and the mango sago were forgettable. Ambience is pleasant, casual but chic, love the atmosphere and its a great place for gatherings whether in a large group or for an intimate dinner. A real pity on the food and service though. It unfortunately did not live up to the hype.

Really enjoyed our dining experience. Fabulous ambience and a Super tempting menu that made us want to order everything. Lovely service too. Favourites included the Wing Bean Salad, Pie Tee and Babi Pongteh. Save room for desserts!!

I think this place is really pricey, however some of the dishes are quite nice though . I like the curry crab and chendol dessert. The wines are good too.

Candlenut is set in a wonderful space at Dempsey Hill complex which is a regenerated British army barracks. Service is very efficient, informative and friendlyWe had the chef's selection menu at 88sgd pp. This consists of canapÃ©s, soup course, selection of mains with fish and meat dishes and finally your own choice of dessert. It was outstanding. Exceptionally well balanced flavours using spices and herbs in perfect harmony. My favourite was blue swimmer crab with galangal, turmeric and kaffir lime.They will try to work around any particular food requirements you have.This place is well worth it's Michelin star and represents amazing value considering the quality and skill you get
5
Had dinner here with 14 others to celebrate my son's 21 birthday. Some were peranakans, and/ or are good cooks of peranakan food. We took the omakase set. Everyone found the food an innovative rendition of traditional peranakan food. Spices were fresh and sufficient. Food we liked best: pie tee, gula melaka prawn ball, pong tauhu soup, tiger prawns( prawns really fresh), beef cheek rendang. Desserts were interesting. Best of all was the bush keluak ice cream. Order this only if you like the taste of bush keluak. The Kueh salat is very very lemak! I usually dun eat Kueh salat but I like this one. A pity there is no durian dessert that night

What a find! Unbelievably wonderful service, food and ambience. I read about the Como redevelopment and the hopes it would drive more people to Dempsey. Well, if one of its tenants, Candlenut is any indication, it will indeed! The peranakan food delighted the taste buds from an interesting menu at reasonable prices. I always get surprised when Singapore locals complain about prices because it is their economy to control and some restaurants are exorbitant, this one is certainly not. Our lovely waitress Aislen talked us through things, constantly offered suggestions and support and ensured everything flowed smoothly. We asked for less hot and they obliged, allowing us to savour the spices rather than have too much of a chilli hit. We loved the pork neck kebabs, the wagyu rib beef rendang, the grilled chicken leg in broth and brown rice. The desserts were a particular moment of heaven, their very popular chocolate dessert at the top of the list, icecream with chocolate poured over and a chocolate soil. Lovely too was the condensed milk cake. Every single floor staff member we encountered was smiling and welcoming. Food delivery was prompt, the wine list was interesting and the restaurant full for its 6.30 sitting. It is surrounded by things to look at. A store with products. A Japanese tempura bar. A cocktail bar and then the other side is another restaurant. All in a huge restored building, now boasting a modern look whilst respecting the past. Beautifully landscaped outside with great furniture in and out. What's not to love! This place is excellent. And for those hoping it will reinvigorate Dempsey, we bought some furniture from a nearby shop, so I reckon their hopes are with solid foundation. Congratulations Candlenut

We expected a nice meal at this One Star Michelin restaurent. The decor was certainly worthy, but the food was disappointing. We will not be returning.The Bak Wang Kepiting soup was not flavourful and too salty,The Crab curry was proudly recommended by the serving steward, but it was below average. The Buah Keluak was not edible as it was not balanced and rich tasting enough. But!! The 4 angled bean or winged bean salad with cashewnuts was excellent! The Chendol dessert was fragrant but overly sweet and the coconut cream was so thick it was like a custard. Prices were very high for very small servings.

Had an enjoyable meal with my boys (15 and 12yo). We ordered a few dishes. For entrees we had homemade kueh pie tee with paper thin shells filled with salman tartare instead of shredded turnip was lovely and fresh and the charred octopus with finely shredded lemon grass, ginger flower and coriander which was similar to a Thai salad and nicely balanced.For mains we had the barramundi (it was ok), ladies fingers (good with a bit of chilli), braised pork cheek pongteh( refined interpretation of the originaldish which my youngest really enjoyed- not spicy ), grilled chicken leg(meh- mild spice), wagyu beef with black sambal and fried rice(youngest gave a thumbs up ). Overall lovely meal which was a refined interpretation of the traditional peranakan dishes. The ambience and the location was also another plus. Worth a visit.

Heard a lot about the restaurant so my partner and I thought we should give it a try. Had to make reservation way beforehand and we were told we only have 2 hours.when we arrived, only 20% of the place was full on a Saturday evening. Maybe cause we were slightly late, the manager (I believe his name is Clarence) kept reminding us that we needed to leave by a certain time. So he kept us from ordering the ahmakase menu. I mean... we were compromised of the whole experience. Quite a disappointment. There were many available tables then, almost 80% of the place empty. But we still kept our words and left soon after the meal. Wouldn't come back again even if the food is good, the experience is destroyed, including my anniversary.
5
The staff makes you feel right at home. They cater to specific dietary wishes. And they are very, very knowledgeable on the dishes served. Each dish has its own unique flavor. The portions are nice, and leave some room for the delightful desserts. Want to experience Peranakan cuisine, Candlenut is a must-try.
5
Anyone who understands a Paranakan meal will know it's is not just the colorful explosion of taste that makes the experience but the company feasting and sharing from common plates that create the palatable bond. Chef Malcolm's Candlenut was the place I took my 15 department team leaders to for a culinary journey to conclude a hard year's cycle and it did not disappoint. These harden 'locals' were impressed by the innovative dishes which made the familiar not so familiar. The biggest compliment came from a well travelled foodie at my table who simply stated, 'this meal was cooked with heart.'I am glad despite the commercial pressure of upkeeping the Michelin standard, this young connoisseur is trying to stay true to his root while not staying static
5
Someone else selected all the many dishes we had. Everyone was delicious. The service was charming and the ambience was great. Can't fault it really
5
Enjoyed a nice relaxed meal for three here on a Monday night. BOOK AHEAD! We had difficulty getting in on the nights we wanted.All three of us tried the tasking menu and it was a great way to go. You get a broader introduction to Peranakan food than trying one or two dishes. I cannot adequately describe the many dished so I will not try but they were consistently very fresh with delicate flavours. Truly a wonderful meal.The ambiance is somewhat less formal that typical for fine dining. Maybe reflective of the overall development?Service was excellent. The young lady who service us seemed very engaged in the cuisine and responded to questions about ingredients. Any question that stepped her she checked with the kitchen.I wish I was able to go there again. Highly recommended
1
I used to like Candlenut alot when they were at the old address at Eu Tong Seng. That was where they earned their Michelin star. Ever since they moved to Dempsey, it has become terrible. I wanted so much to like it but unfortunately after giving it 3 more trials in the new Dempsey place, it is still very disappointing. The food maybe ok but because the ambiance here is so cold and souless like eating in a canteen/warehouse (unlike the previous place where they were cosier and made more effort with decor) it has somehow affected how the food taste now. I know they can do more with their ambiance as it just requires alittle bit more effort and creativity to make the space more cosy!! Throw in some rugs or plants or whatever!

Candlenut @ Dempsey has gone upmarket.Ambience is much nicer than before.In premises shared with a Japanese restaurant, a mini Market, a bar in the centre of the premises and at the other end a French restaurant.The waitresses are no longer in kebayas. Why? Because it doesn't fit the new image.Thought I saw the Chef walking around in a suit!Good thing they brought back the ala carte menu for dinner.Set dinner like degustation is now at $88 per person. I remember it went up from about $55 to $65 the last time at its old premises.Satay didn't have much of a satay sauce. It was just grilled meat. This was much better previously. They shouldn't have changed it!Crispy bean curd skin ngor hiang (minced pork, prawns & water chestnut) - not fragrant. The one at Singapura Seafood Restaurant is better.Wild caught baby squid, sambal belachan cherry tomatoes & red onions texture of squid was tender, sauce was good, cherry tomatoes good too. Overall it is tasty but a tad saltish.Tiger prawns, petai beans, tamarind & shallots - good taste.Candlenut's classic chendol cream, Pandan jelly & Gula Melaka - Super sweet but I think it's meant to be.I would say it's good but on this particular night it was not quite worthy of its Michelin Star

Candlenut provides an excellent dining experience. It doesn't deserve some of the mean-spirited TripAdvisor reviews. If you read a lot of restaurant reviews in Singapore (e.g., at HungyGoWhere), you will see that it's common for reviewers to enjoy being hypercritical. The portions at Candlenut are relatively small and perhaps more expensive than a typical old-school Peranakan restaurant with dirty walls. But I left the restaurant with a full stomach, and I was satisfied with the experience and the amount of money spent in exchange.To the haters, remember what it means to be a restaurant with a Michelin star. The Michelin Guide provides information to diners who have not gathered as much information on their own. The price will be higher, and the restaurant will cater to the internationally-mobile upper middle class diner. So maybe Candlenut doesn't meet the standards of a Peranakan food expert who has spent his or her life gathering Peranakan restaurant intelligence, but these people don't need a Michelin Guide to inform them about Peranakan restaurants. One Michelin star means the restaurant provides "very good cooking in its category." Candlenut is at least that, even if there is another Peranakan restaurant out there that may offer even better cooking.Candlenut offers a modernized version of historic Singaporean fine dining. The restaurant location (on Dempsey Hill), set in the woods almost like an old black and white colonial bungalow, the high ceilings, the tiled floors, the old tiffins as decorations -- these all work together to hint at the old days. Also hinting at the old days is the food itself: a style with roots dating back hundreds of years to this slice of land along the Straits of Malacca. Perhaps in the old days, such a restaurant would serve fine European food, but for all its throwback charm, this is a modern restaurant. While it may be presented in a Western manner with some Western touches (e.g., a wine list), the food is not like any food I ever had in the US or Europe.I thoroughly enjoyed my experience at Candlenut and will go back again. I will probably go back again after that too

I am baffled by why this place seems so popular.The Como warehouse(for that is what it is) has all the ambience of an aircraft hangar.It has an arrogant and customer unfriendly reservation system which means it is virtually impossible to eat when you want without being rushed.The food is average sort of Peranakan and served in the smallest possible sizes .The prices are ludicrous.Our okra was undercooked and slimy, our lamb chops tough and tasteless and the beer described as a German lager style turned out to be an amber ale- it actually says that on the bottle so you think they might have noticed. Once the novelty of this place has worn off I cannot see it surviving very long.We shall not retur
4
The new location in Como Dempsey is nice. There is a fair bit of construction work so taxi may find it hard to locate. You can drop off at the small roundabout and walk in via a small paved walkway. Alternatively you can go around the front and come to a big car park on the other side and walk down the verandah. The service was good. The staff was very obliging and customised the set menu for two of eight of us with dietary restrictions. Service could be more polished as at times the staff seemed confused. The food was delicious fusion Peranakan. Serving size was good. You will certainly be full after four entrees and five mains. One dessert is included. All for $88 per person.The restaurant is open so it has a rather limited scope for decor and ambience, especially there is a shop next to it.Worth return visit
3
3 persons and the meal costs $250 which is alright if the food was memorable and the palate satisfied. The assam fish and beef kerluak was a disappointment as the paste was finely grinded to a smooth thick gravy ... no complexity, no texture. The sambal prawn petai was average. The only standout was the kerluak fried rice and the kerluak ice cream dessert. Even the chendol was a disappointment. Portion was on the small side but this can be overlooked if the food was truly a one michelin star quality
5
We really enjoyed this restaurant. The food was delicious and the service was friendly and very helpful. Some reviews from locals complain about portion size, but we left more than satisfied in terms of quantity and quality. It was nice to get away from the more touristy areas too. The beef rendang was stunning
5
We had dinner at Candlenut after seeing it on the Michelin guide.It was a wonderful experience!First of all, it is located at Dempsey, which is a lovely neighborhood, very charming, with lots of good restaurants.The staff was very nice, polite and helpful with the food choice.Food was delicious, you could feel the technique, the flavours, the spices, the textures...We had 4 dishes in two people, one pork belly (fantastic), one crab curry (amazing!), king prawns (oh my god). And the chocolat desert was amazing! Do try that! Takes you to your childhood...Good wine list, also. And very fair prices.Thank you, Candlenut! We loved the whole experience
5
Love the restaurant. A great modern twist on peranakan food. The dishes are spicy and tasty and presented really well, lots of delicious flavours. Service is very good. Love the space the restaurant is in. Great addition to Dempsey Hill. Definitely be going back. 🍷🍷👍

Last year, Candlenut was awarded one-Michelin-star status, an accolade that means its cuisine is “a very good restaurant in its category.”So I went.It being the world’s first Michelin-starred Peranakan restaurant, I was really looking forward to my dinner – expectations were high but realistic. My meal at Candlenut was a study in average, unevenly cooked fare, a tough sell in a city like Singapore. The kitchen seemed to try too hard to be “different” but the food was often too bland. None of the plates served barring the homemade kueh pie tie shell, crab meat, yeye curry, pickled shallot, laksa leaf – were, in any way, remarkable. When you are paying good money for a meal you expect at least a few dishes to be memorable.Overpriced. A one-star disappointment. This is the true truth as I say it as it is
5
Candlenut was indeed an experience. We opted for the omakase menu. We took a gamble n it paid off. Salmon kueh pie tee to bush keluak beef rendang. Our taste buds were awakened by a multitude of flavours all working perfectly together. Definitely will be going there again.
3
Pretentious description of dishes for what you get. Servings for the type of dishes are ridiculous. Looks like want to follow the International new cuisine for this matter of presentation but fails. Unattractive dishes (colours , presentation, gen appearance) at the bottom of small bowl. Every dish tried was more a kind of fusion or ....? but none made us say "oh this one is good" , none. Want to be , but cannot .
3
Great to have a new restaurant in Singapore that is showcasing Peranakan cuisine, but these guys are taking the mickey post their star with silly high prices for dishes that you could easily cook at home and amateur service. Not sure what Michelin was thinking, no way the restaurant would ever be contemplated for a star in France
5
Love the new space in COMO dempsey, it's beautiful! I'm glad the ala carte menu is back for dinner. We loved the buah keluak chicken, beef rendang and blue swimmer crab curry. The starters like kueh pie tee and ngoh hiang had refreshing flavours. The best is of course the desserts! Besides high quality favourites like chendol, we enjoyed the buah keluak ice cream which comes with plesant textural surpises! The kueh salat with coconut ice cream is also one of the best! Overall, a wonderful meal with excellent service
4
We wanted to choose a Michelin star restaurant, of good quality and that did not ruin us. Of course we wanted to eat Asian food. This restaurant calls itself the only Peranakan with Michelin star. We did not knew this type of cuisine, later we ate the traditional Peranakan in Malaysia. This allows me now to consider that this is a good and modern interpretation. The restaurant is modern and relaxed , the service friendly. We ordered the tasting menu, had 4 mini starters and then more half a dozen small mains. Liked everything, well presented, well-seasoned. And I'm not a big fan of desserts but I loved the one made with pandam leaves. Menu for 2 with 4 beers cost us 175 euros. But we were satisfied. Be aware that the area is under construction, the taxi driver had difficulty to find the place and even so after driving around he left us in the back
5
Candlenut is a beautiful new restaurant in the Como chain. The interior is simple, but elegant. The tile floors add a true Pernakan touch with straw lighting and comfortable seating. Our hostess and wait staff were knowledgeable and friendly.The fusion lunch was packed with flavor and mildly spicy. I enjoyed the entire exoerience. In the same complex is a curious display of Asian spices and bottled sauces. Candlenut is the place for a real foodie looking beyond the usual fare
1
Our first time to this place. Walking into Candlenut, the place has a great ambience which makes you feel like you will be having a good night and great food. Was looking forward to it. The problem is the ATTITUDE of the Reservation Lady. We booked a week before and she said couldn't find our name. Arrogance And Pompous ATTITUDE not to mention slowness and lack of response No APOLOGY And ARGUMENTATIVE. And all these was played out in front of the kids. It was so embarrassing. With the hype on this place, being a one Michelin , we had our expectations heighten too but it is intolerable not to have someone who understands customer relationship management. This was supposed to be a special night out but she messed it up.
4
"Pie tee" is a favorite and classic Hokkien Peranakan dish, we found the lunch pie tee here sadly composed of mostly wet turnip and provided insufficient pastry cups (they charge $1 per extra cup ) However, ngoh hiang, wagyu rendang, ayam buah keluak, angle-bean salad were yummy and authentic. Cool and edgy COMO decor; knowledgeable & friendly staff. Overall, this is a treat for friends & family.
5
Highly recommended. Peranakan cuisine creatively taken a few notches up the fine dining scale. Not for the purists nor traditionalists though. The portion size is indeed on the small side, but it suits me fine as I am all about quality, not quantity. All the dishes we ordered for lunch were delicious. The Buah Keluak ice cream is the stand-out on the dessert menu - truly genius
4
We had lunch here after visiting the botanic gardens. The staff were very friendly and helpful, although when we ordered we didn't realise two of the 3 main dishes we ordered were in the same sort of sauce (Buah Keluak), and perhaps the staff could have pointed this out - we found out Buah Keluak is a rich spicy sauce with hints of cocoa. It was in the chicken curry which was my favourite dish of the day. It was delicious as was the Ngoh Hiang - a crispy bean curd skin roll filled with amazing flavours and textures. My husband rated the beef rendang as one of the best he has ever had. Overall a very pleasant lunch in lovely surroundings

I take extreme care in writing restaurant reviews, but felt I needed to be as objective as I can regarding my first visit to Candlenut. I will have to start my review from the way the dinner ended. My host, a great one by the way, strongly recommended we dine at Candlenut for a cosy dinner party of 10. After an awesome time, my host looked at the bill and politely mentioned that we did not order one of the dishes (Chap Chye) that he was billed for. To be very sure, our host asked us if that specific dish (Chap Chye X 3 servings) had been served and we all confirmed that it was not. The server returned to our table and informed us that he personally served us that dish. Again, we told him it was not. We ordered 3 portions each of every dish and they were set equally across the table - none of us had tasted it. The manager then returned for a third time with a bowl of Chap Chye dish for visual verification. By then, we felt the embarrassment our host was put through. We dine very often and besides, a few of us are of Peranakan parentage and we know how a Chap Chye dish looked like. This could have been handled with a lot more tact although we understood that his intention was purely to avoid any misunderstanding. One simply cannot pay for what one had not ordered and we felt unjust that our host was put on the spot. Our host ended the dinner by giving the servers Red Packets (cash gifts in red envelopes) as his gestures of appreciation and also in the good spirit of Chinese New Year. Service plays a big part. Now, the dishes. The yellow coconut curry of crab was flavour-packed and of a good mesh of sweetness and spice; and crab was fresh. Kueh Pie Tee that came in thin and crispy shells were mouth-popping and easy to eat. The Ayam Buah Keluak - would have preferred the shells as the "digging of the flesh" is part of the experience. Dessert, I had the Durian Soup dessert, and would suggest you skip that if you are a Durian fan. Overall, would return to Candlenut only if I am invited by another gracious host. To some of the servers who attended to us that night, thank you, your smiles did make our night

Restaurant was at Dorsett residences. Excellent food n cuisine! V v tasty. Buah Keluak ice cream was v unique n tasty, still lingers in my mind. Everything was presented beautifully. Service was excellent too! Very pleasant of them to give us a glass of bubbly each for its opening. Air con broke down.....we were eating spice in the "heat". Overall experience good. The service guy (the older hotelier) saved de day!

Our first time at this so-called 1 star Michelin place. It was my birthday meal with my family and it was the worst birthday celebration in 5 decades! This is the first time we have been charged for condiments - they CHARGED $2 for 20g of sambal belachan. They did not even reflect the price of the sambal belachan in their menu price list. When i asked the wait staff why they did not reflect the price of the sambal belachan in their menu, he insisted that it is in it. I asked to see the menu and he conveniently disappeared and went ahead to serve other customers, hoping that I would forget about asking him the menu. Of course he did not return. Is this what one can expect from a Michelin starred restaurant??? When i checked the menu again, it is indeed not reflected in the menu. And he had the audacity to lie about it!! . To the Peranakans, sambal belachan is like ketchup is to french fries. It's ludicrous and unheard of to charge something so basic. It's like charging for ketchup and chill sauce. When we feedback to the chef by name of Malcolm, he gave the excuse that they don't make money from the sambal belachnan, even though it costs $2 a pop, that it's a tedious process in making the belachan and the whole block smells of it. Unfortunately, isn't that the costs of doing business? We gave him solutions (like provide 2 free rounds of the condiments and charge the third onwards) and how to add the costs into the food or as part of costs of operations which is the norm in many F&B cases but he refused to take our feedback into consideration. Arrogant and high handed! Additionally, their staff also do not know their food and are not trained. When asked for recommendations, they recommended assam and curry. Both are of varying tastes but wait staff recommended. Sadly, I have been to better restaurants with more Michelin stars (in other parts of the world) than Candlenut and their food is way better and the staff attitude is definitely not as high handed as this bunch at Candlenut. They have lost their soul and too caught up in the "atas" world of Michelin star. With so many negatives I wonder how Michelin select them as a Michelin star restaurant. I am ashamed to call this bunch of blokes Peranakans. Sad

We came here to celebrate Daddy's birthday and love the dishes, even though we are not great fans of nonya cuisine. The environment is very nice, with white-washed wall set in the quiet gardens in Dempsey Hill area. Interior decor are modern and very cosy looking. We chose the "ah-ma-kase" menu to have a sample of their best selection. My favourite starters are the Kueh Pie-Ti and Wing Bean Salad. They taste just right with a slight twist of zest. My son prefers the Pork Neck Satay which is very tasty & succulent. For mains, most of their dishes are master art pieces in their own rights: the 1824 Grain-fed Beef Short Ribs stew, Blue Swimmer Crab Curry & King Tiger Prawns are simple delicious and you just want to have more of them. However I found the Buah Keluak Fried Rice too spicy, and the Grilled Lamb Rack is just average. Desserts are interesting -- the special Candlenut only Buah Keluak Ice Cream with Valrhona Chocolate & Chilli is unusual but not my cup of tea. The Classic Chendol Cream is too sweet, I prefer the really classic ones you get at hawker centre. My sons raved about the Condensed Milk Sugee Cake with Milk & Honey Ice-cream. I think the next time I visit this place I want to try the Durian Ice-cream which looks v good. Overall we enjoyed the ambience, careful service and most importantly the well prepared food. It may be slightly pricer but it is definitely quality food.

Last December, my wife booked our group of 9 for a special occasion. We had been there before at the previous location. And had ok to good memories of the food and service.This time we were a little shocked. Quantities are for hamsters. Food quality is still high but from the last time, they have gone chi chi pretentious which is the very antithesis of good ol' Peranakan food. Which is hearty, with loads of spice, wholesome, "la familia", sharing, communal, you get the drift.Each dish that came out elicited muffled laughter and jokes in our group. Because, they have truly gone a whole new direction which is counter to what we remember the ol' Candlenut to be. The portions are laughable. They need to relook and make changes because they are losing a whole host of their previous supporters. At other starred restaurants, they don't serve hamster-portions. Some fried rice thing was yummy but there was enough to go around for two 4 year olds. The rest of us had a teaspoonful. The marginal cost is minimal but the management has decided the negative reviews are less important than the marginal cost of giving more.Decor at new place rocks though. We love it. And service was ok

lusciously tasty food in an uber pleasant space. celebrated a birthday lunch here and came away feeling very happy. starters were nice but not spectacular (we ordered wing bean salad and crispy pork) but the mains were superb—prawns in a coconut, gula melaka sauce, kangkong and jackfruit curry, blue swimmer crab curry (that had luscious portions of crab meat), chicken cooked with the black nut that is famous in peranakan cooking, and grilled sea bass with a spicy, flavorful topping. my mouth waters recollecting the flavours. and dessert was exemplary too—tapioca cake with gula melaka ice cream and chendol with coconut, gula melaka. the portions are medium sized, not huge, and prices are fairly high but i would certainly go back more than once to try everything on the menu. i visited candlenut in its old location in chinatown but like the new space so much better

A stone throw away from the US embassy lies this well-hidden gem. It doesn't look like much from the outside, neither does it from the inside. The low-key interior and the high ceilings give the impression of a modernized market hall, very airy and clean. However, the food is heavenly! Juicy & tender chicken satay with lots of meat on the skewers and delicious pineapple-peanut sauce set the start for a journey of culinary delights. Add the crab curry for a bowl of creamy coconut curry with notes of kefir, chili and lemongrass - lots of juicy crabmeat chunks included! Finish off with a refreshing Thai coconut and spoon it out completely. Enjoy!10/10 - Everything tasted excellent

The food in general was good; i think most people would enjoy the meal.Service was excellent as well.Price is on the high side; and be prepared for very very small portions. If you are a big group or big eaters or very hungry, you will get a shock.1 bowl of curry = about 7 spoons
5
Had an excellent meal with friends. Starters, curries and other main course dishes are very good. Portions are just nice, small portions and you are able to order dishes to share. Highly recommended.

We really did not enjoy our meal. There are much better Peranakan establishments around in Singapore, and it is a real pity that those are not recognized. Am not sure what the Michelin reviewers saw, but this certainly should not be representative of the Peranakan food in Singapore. While we appreciate the attempts to push boundaries, the flavours were lacking oomph and character. The beef rendang was the saving grace for the meal. The buah keluak ice-cream just left a bad taste in the mouth, and did little to showcase the deep and complex characteristics of this unique fruit

This restaurant is a true treasure. We opted for the tasting menu which allowed our group of 6 to have 4 appetizers and four entrees and therefore we were able to try many of their signature dishes. My favorites included the black nut wagyu beef short ribs which had very tender meat and a dark black smooth sauce. I also enjoyed the curried crab and large prawns. The lamb chops were spicey and delicious and all the foods had lots of flavor without burning your mouth off with Birdseye chili peppers. We had a beautiful salad with some traditional green bean and it was light and flavorful. I thought the black nut ice cream with chili and chocolate was one of the highlights of the evening. We were treated by our hosts to a Mouton Rothschild champagne and an Opus One Cabernet and that made the evening truly spectacular. This is located in the Dempsey area and I would recommend it to anyone that enjoys traditional cuisine that is raised to an artistic level. I believe this restaurant has one Michelin star and it is really excellent. I would definitely go back so I could enjoy more of the chefs artistic representations of traditional Peranakan food.

Excited to tagged along with friends who mentioned this is the worldâ€™s first Michelin-starred Peranakan restaurant. In the end, all i can say is that first the judges who gave the star probably have not try what Peranakan food really taste or should taste like. Second, i have been to establishment which is just a stall that sell Peranakan food and taste many times better. The food there was horrible, tasteless and i think its just a joke to be given Michelin star

Tried to get in here on a short break in 2013 after reading good reviews, but was fully booked. This time I booked online for our group of 7 before our planned holiday which was easy and convenient.We enjoyed a great dinner from the set menu which took us through a wide range of Peranakan inspired, but modern dishes. I would be keen to try the restaurant again at the Dorsett, as previous venue was just ok. Staff were very lovely, but I thought a little inexperienced for this level of restaurant. Would definitely recommend.
5
I had the menu degustation which was impressive. All the traditional favours were there but in addition the chef went beyond the usual boundaries to create new taste experiences. The crab with kaffir lime was great as were all the main dishes. Buah keluak icecream was unique as have never seen this elsewhere -- clever to take a traditional savoury flavour and make this a successful icecream
4
We ate at the 'old' Candlenut in Outram Park several times and the food at the new location is just as good. New venue is quieter (although nearly all tables full at our visit) which is a blessing. Service, however, is too fast ... it was as though they wanted us to eat up and go :-( Hope for a more relaxed evening next time
2
Food was value for money when the restaurant was still at Dorsett Hotel. Generous servings and great value for money for their Ahmakase menu. So was looking forward to try with friends at their new location, especially seeing the shots of their dining room.However, it was disappointing overall. Disappointing is a gross understatement. Food portions gotten so tiny that I probably had a tablespoon of curry shared between the my friends. How to enjoy the food? Why Ah ma like that? Flavours have become milder compared to when I tried with my friend earlier in the year. Seasoning was also on the weak side. However, the satay was still as good if not slightly better. Even though we ordered quite a number of dishes, we had to go elsewhere for supper to be full.Bottom line: I will not be coming back. I understand the hype as having a Michelin star. But it's lost its soul and the feel of communal eating. Ah Ma has become too stingy after moving to more atas premises. Level of food have dropped and price has surged. I will be spending my money elsewhere. Full stop

So I've got a question..."can a Michelin star be relocated?" Judging by the official definition "One Star - very good cooking in it category", it can be, as it's the cooking that gets the star as opposed to the overall experience......who knew?!!My wife had been to the old Candlenut and couldn't recommend it highly enough, so when the "13 course extravaganza...paired with wines selected by Robert Parker" came up, I was excited...even at $200 a head. Let's be clear. If Robert Parker selected these wines, either he's decided to shop at Fair Price or he's thrown in the towel. A basic, 2013 Torbreck Woodcutter's Semillon (Wine Searcher average price S$27 and a score or 87/100) and a young Languedoc-Roussillon (S$28, 89/100) was as good as it got. For the price, I'd at least expected some thought to have gone into it, but unfortunately not. So if you're getting cheap wine for your $200, you'd at least expect a fair quantity of wine, right?....let me tell you a story....So we arrived to the new venue. It's open and airy but a bit soulless (try Violet Oon on Bukit Timah if you really want to see Peranakan soul). We immediately dubbed it "McCandkenuts". The staff were walking around in black t-shirts and jeans whereas the old place was black tie service....maybe I'm old fashioned, but t-shirts for a special dinner doesn't do it for me. We sat for quite some time before being spoken too. Being a wine dinner, I asked if we could have some wine....and the answer was "oh, you have to wait for the food before you can have wine"!! Really??...at $200 per head? So I ordered a bottle of champagne at $148 and asked that the first course be held back till we'd finished the bubbles (after all, there were only 4 tables occupied at this stage). Predictably, the first course came right in the middle of the champagne and we had to ask again for it to wait. When the food was served, it was very good. Excellent Peranakan cooking, tasty and plentiful. Despite the ordinary wine, served in very sort measures, I have to give it to the Chef....,EXCEPT....where was he? Apparently this was a 13 course extravaganza "with Malcom Lee"....but we never saw him! Usually these "dinners with...." have the Chef coming out at some point to talk to the patrons and explain what he's just cooked for us....Nope! No Malcolm!Finally, we asked for the bill. As the "per head" had been paid in advance, there was only the champagne to settle. And sadly the $148 bottle of fizz had been rung up as $168...small error, I know, but it was "injury to insult" by that point. So, will I be back to Candlenut? Not really. Violet Oon doesn't have a Michelin star but is so much better, in so many ways

This was the first time we tried a Michelin starred restaurant with Asian Cuisine.....I have eaten in many Michelin starred restaurants in Europe so was not sure what to expectOverall, the food we had was fantastic, was it one Michelin star???I am not sure but don't want to go into it too muchLooking at the pork belly, it was utterly delicious, tender and still crisp on the outside. Another highlight was the beef cheek, it melted in my mouth and the flavors were fantasticSome of the dishes didn't wow us away, but still were very good....desserts were flavorful but I did somehow expect a bit moreThe price on pays here is very fair, taking again into consideration what one pays in Europe for a Michelin experience, I was really surprised and felt the whole meal was great value for moneyService was very attentive and knowledgeable, especially as the Peranakan cuisine is not something everyone know. They gave great recommendationsA place that I would not hesitate to retur
4
The chef decides the menu. The food were overall great. Loves the curries and the appetizers. But some dishes were a bit too salty for me, especially the duck soup. The durian dessert was one of the best!
5
Very clever arty setting on
hill.it does look like a art gallery
The food is very special with spices I never had before called candle nut.
Ask for the special dinner taster.
3
The decor was rustic with straw lamp shades. Fast service. We had starters with satay, stewed vegetables that you scooped into fried pastry cups and prawn crackers. Then mains with steaming hot rice, beef rendang coconut strength, vegetables in mild spicy sauce and coconut water from the shell. Good service with older waiting staff. KK had the chendol or green jelly with coconut. The flavors smacked of Singapore in the 21st century. The charm of old Melaka in the food was cloaked by the Sporean modern fog.
5
If you're visiting Singapore, please make sure you book dinner at Candlenut right now. Malcolm Lee has hung his Michelin Star on the wall, but remains as humble as ever, dedicating long hours to perfecting his vision of modern Peranakan food. (for those not familiar with it, Peranakan food combines Chinese and Malay culinary tradition, a result of intermarriage between the races)Candlenut's food is not only beautifully, skillfully prepared, it is also intrinsically satisfying. If you are familiar with the cuisine, you will find no fault with the interpretations. Malcolm is not a man to turn his curries into foams or his satés into spheres, his is the art of elevating tradition and translating it into modern fine dining. Our rather blasé Parisian friends proclaimed it the best meal they had this year and if anyone out there tells me this is not fine dining, I will challenge them to show me dining finer than this
2
Very disappointing ‘Evening with Malcolm Lee of Candlenut’, a Robert Parker Wine Advocate event with Michelin.The flyer said ‘The 13-course extravaganza…courses are paired with Robert Parker’s selection of wines…’. So 2 ordinary wines served was a clear misrepresentation. Certainly not worth nearly $200/head. As for Malcolm, his food was pretty good and the Nasi Ulam – herb rice – was quite special and a lot of effort had been put into the 13 courses. But I would have expected Malcolm to come out of the kitchen and say ‘hi’ seeing as it was an evening with him and perhaps talk to us about the food? That's the experience that makes a good restaurant amazing.The service was not Michelin standard and ambience is a bit auditorium at Dempsey, not intimate.After dining at the old premises I had higher expectations
3
Visited this outlet two nights ago. Had dinner like in the past at Dorset. Parking is much easier now and deco is nice with lights of bird cages in style. Overall ambience is above average but too cold and spartan is intention to make it cosy as in garden entrance. Food presentation was nice and tasted good too. Service was prompt but could use some personal touch. It's lacking in personal warmth and just delivery good service via text book. Needs some sincerity and touching base I think. Dessert was good as well. Wine is too highly priced and is could tapper a little down and have more selection for by the glass would be good. The yellow tin for forks n spoons took out some of the classy atmosphere although it was to bring some nostalgia. Too immerse with eating I forgot to take the pictures of the food !!

The buah keluak here is de-shelled, so you don't have to get messy fingers digging out the delicacy. I am usually wary of fusion, but must admit that overall, chef Malcolm Lee has been quite clever in innovating and lightening up peranakan cooking, making possible more frequent visits to his restaurant; normally I find heavy cuisines too challenging to have more than twice a year. We very much liked the pong tauhu soup, the refreshing wing bean salad (tastes almost like a Vietnamese salad 'gỏi'), and the buah keluak fried rice. The curries are good, but somehow less satisfying than the original versions. Desserts (durian soup, chendol) are too subtle for gratification. Beware if you go with a large group, for portions are minuscule; but if you're only two or three, this allows you to sample more dishes. To go with the cooking, the décor is airy and westernised, almost the opposite of the elegant but more traditional cooking and ambience at Violet Oon's National Kitchen - another new temple of peranakan cuisine in Singapore. Service at TNK is more professional, though
3
Visited this place for a business lunch. Decor is very simple and looks like they are still setting up. Service was attentive and good. The concept is quite interesting for Singapore where the chef goes to local markets and then creates the menu for the day. We ordered a couple of dishes the chicken curry and beef rangdan. Maybe i had high expectations but i found the food quite bland and the rice was not cooked consistently through.
3
I applaud the Michelin inspectors for recognizing local cuisine but if my first contact was anything to go by, then I have doubts. Upon arrival for lunch with only two tables occupied, the hostess could not find my reservation. This in itself could be rectified by assigning us a table but she persisted in asking if my reservation was made in another name. Duh of course I gave the name under which I made the reservation. So not an auspicious start. Once we had ordered & the food arrived, things improved. Peranakan food is something that most people have personal memories of. Tampering with traditional recipes is flying close to the fire. Some can produce a refreshing spin when Western techniques are applied, other less so. We ordered ngoh hiang, a meat roll wrapped in bean curd skin as a snack & it was passable. For me handcut chunks of meat give more bite and a better mouth feel. Grinding the meat too fine loses its appeal for me though somewhat alleviated by the crunch of chopped water chestnuts. The buah keluak fried rice succeeded because it was a tasty dish, full of umami but not sure if it was worth $28. We both loved the refreshing wing bean salad with its tangy dressing. So two thumbs up here. The Assam squid in a sauce comprising its own ink & tamarind did not resonate with us. And the portion was paltry. Honestly at $20, there were hardly a couple of bites each. Fortunately we had ordered other dishes. Kueh Bingka, a traditional cake made of tapioca was pleasant with a quenelle of gula ice cream but again was overpriced. At the end, we felt it was an average experience. We may return but hopefully the chef was make some adjustments. I had a better experience at Candlenut 's previous location. Did it deserve its star? The jury is undecided on this.

We had dinner at Candlenut recently and enjoyed it very much. This restaurant has a lovely leafy setting in the Dempsey Road enclave of eclectic upmarket restaurants. It is housed in a large colonial building with huge pillars and very high ceilings. Cuisine wise, it offers a modern, inspired take on Peranakan/Nonya food. Many of the dishes are still recognisably Peranakan eg the squid sambal with petai, bakwan kepiting (Crab and Meatball Soup) and the chendol dessert. We had the tasting menu which was excellent. It offered tasting portions of many of the menu favourites. We especially liked the beef shortribs in buah keluak (black nut) sauce, prawn cutlets (hay cho), winged bean salad and buah keluak ice cream with chocolate sauce on a bed of crackling chocolate sand. The last item seemed a doubtful combination, but it actually worked, and was delicious. All in, a very satisfying dinner
3
Heard good review about this place especially when they have been awarded 1 Michelin Star. My experience, tried calling the restn for few days (the troll free number on the website doesn't seems to be working very well), so hard to get thru to someone to pick up the call. Reservation online is not open till few weeks after, since they are not able to handle he volume of reservation coming in. I think they are not ready to handle the crowd, so they are controlling their seating & timing. When we dine there, we don't see them turning over table.Looking at the menu for tonight, there seems to be lots of interesting dishes that we like to try. Few service staff were very attentive & able to recommend their signature or popular dishes. We took some of their recommendation. After trying there food, I don't quite understand how they manage to get a star. The crab pie tee is tiny, 4pcs for $16, taste is so so. Kurobuta pork satay is tender, but nothing to scream about. For Mains, Tiger Prawns Petai, I thought Tiger Prawns should be of decent size but pretty size. Ayam Buah Keluak & Barramundi Assam Pedas are decent. Sayur Lodeh is so so. Most of the main dishes are served lukewarm. Maybe I am expecting too much since most people fave about it. But for me & my friend, we felt, it is only so so.
3
I used to like the food there very much but not sure why they came out with this set dinner that food service are not so traditional. I had a bad exp on that ... The set dinner don't have all my favorite dishes eg ... Duck salted veg soup. Chap Chye , Ngoh Hiang and my durian paste. Have not been there since then...
4
Had lunch and dinner in 2 weeks at Candlenut. A great gastronomic experience. Spices were not unnecessarily 'to your face' but was subtle yet identifiable to the palate. I recommend Buah Keluak that gives a rich taste of the nut but not needing dig messily into the shell. The Gula Melaka Giant Prawns was totally divine for anyone who's a seafood lover and prefers non-spicy. I practically lapped up the sauce. The Satay served at dinner and lunch was different. Both had that char broiled taste and aroma that hits just the right spot for a meat lover. The Beef Rendang gave every spoon of rice a reason to be devoured. And the list goes on.....Desserts were uniquely served - retaining the Peranakan taste and presented with the Western culinary touch. Personally, I would recommend the Coconut Sorbet.
5
We chose this restaurant for our first night in Singapore after searching Trip Advisor. What a great choice - the food was a set menu and nothing we ate disappointed us. Beautifully prepared and served. The waiter was also just wonderful - explaining each of the dishes served and going the extra step to ensure we understood what we were to be eating. Highly recommended
5
I was recommended this place for a memorable meal with my partner and was not disappointed. The waiter, Felix, was extremely knowledge and professional about the dishes that were to be served to us that evening. Every item on the customised menu was very thoughtfully put together and the flavours were exquisite. I loved the free flow of rice because the dish portions were generous and the best part of the night was the dessert! The flavours were spot on yet presented in a way that you know from the beginning does represent itself as a Peranakan fusion restaurant. Not many of those around at the moment so Candlenut is definitely setting the bar high
3
They specialize in peranakan cuisine, which basically means a mixture of Chinese and Malay cooking. It also means spicy food lol. I'm not really too big on super spicy food, so there were some dishes which I didn't appreciate. But if you're in Singapore, then it's part of the experience to try. I liked the beef rendang dish and their chocolate with chili dessert. Savory with a spicy kick
4
I agree with the last 2 reviews which are an excellent reference on the food here. Let me mention the other elements.Service is Michelin quality and faultless. Explanations and stories - if you want - are worth hearing and add that interest that lifts to food to the next level. Not intrusive or interrupting, as is the case in many fine dining establishments.What lets this restaurant down is ambience. It really feels like a hotel restaurant, which it is, being on the ground floor of the Dorsett Hotel. I suggest wait for the move to Dempsey Hill which is slated for late 2016 (and couldn't be sooner). Still, Candlenut is a standout although I prefer Violet Oon on Bukit Timah Rd (not National Gallery!) for better food, equally good service and better ambience for the time being
3
This Peranakan restaurant has one Michelin star.The entrees were creative and tasted nice: swimmer crab pai tee, crispy duck dumpling, chicken kerabu and kurobota pork satay.The mains were average. Tiger prawns with turmeric and laksa leaves, and duroc pork cheek with assam curry were good. Grilled chicken salad and barramundi curry were average. The duck meatball soup was so salty it was impossible to drink.The buah keluak ice cream with Valrhona ice cream was delicious. The chendol was excellent
4
Our recent experience of restaurants in Singapore looking to modernise traditional local cuisine has not been encouraging. That said, Candlenut stands out from the crowd having got this right.Dinner is served Omakase style. The food cleverly updates traditional dishes by lightening up on the saltiness and heaviness; enhancing them with modern ingredients. The standout dishes for us were:1. Kueh pie tee with blue swimmer crab- great flavour but larger portions please. 2. Korubuta pork satay - deep flavours and incredibly tender pork3. Carrot and guava salad served with lemongrass and grilled chicken - an unusual pairing of salads which compliment the grilled chicken nicely 4. barramundi curry - deliciously light curry gravy and fresh barramundi fillets5. Baby squid assam pedals - tender thinly sliced baby squid in a light but punchy tamarind and tomato broth 6. Mao shang wang durian ice cream served with D24 durian puree - really good take on the ice cream parfait. The durian was delicious.While not real fans of the nonya buah kerluak (candlenut) dish, the soup that was served with dinner is a much lighter version of the traditional dish and can be described as a beef broth flavoured with star anise and other spices. The candlenut has been pureed into the soup rather than being served whole in its shell in the soup.Service is professional and efficient.The decor of the restaurant could probably be described as modern though slightly austere. While we are all for championing food quality over style, now that the restaurant has one Michelin star, it would be great to see it housed in premises of a style and decor reflective of the elegant COMO hotels (we note the common owners). We were a party of 6 and paid S$79 each
4
We went there for dinner with friends. There was a single option for the tasting menu and it was really nice to be able to share all the dishes with each other. The fish and the Valrhona dessert were probably the highlights of what we've had. The wine list is rather short so we picked a bottle of CrÃ©mant from Bourgogne which nicely paired with most of the food. This is probably the only Michelin star restaurant that will charge you 60 cents for a glass of warm water!Overall when compared to fellow Michelin star restaurants this one is overrated. The service is good but not excellent. In which high-end restaurant would you get paper napkins? It was good but not refined and at the end of the day it's definitely overpriced for the value of the food we had. Oh and we got kicked out by people who wanted to start cleaning the restaurant at 10:30pm. Funny, unless when it happens in a starred restaurant
5
Had the ala carte lunch. Impressed with the rendang which is really infused with flavours, simply had to soak up all the gravy with my rice. Prawn roll is firm to the bite with bits of carrot.
5
Very creative and well executed take on peranakan cuisine. Freshness of the ingredients is apparent. Come in with an open mind, it's more of an experience than a simple normal dinner in a restaurant.
4
wish the a-la-carte menu was still an option as i really liked their wagyu beef rendang. their buakeluat ice cream is awesome!
3
We have been to Singapore a few times but have never tried Peranakan food. This time with the michelin guide in hand we decided to try out this 1 star restaurant. We chose to have lunch instead of dinner there because it serves a la carte menu during lunch. We ordered kueh pie tee, bakwan kepiting, rendang, gula melaka king prawns. The kueh pie tee was nice but the other dishes tasted terribly bland, not sure if it's the authentic Peranakan taste . . .
4
The prawn sambal was tangy, sweet and hot a good combination of flavoursThe fish wrapped in banana leaf flaourfulMy favourite were the wing bean salad, chap chye and Nho Hiang.Dissappointed for charging us $2/- for a very small portion of sambal belachanand 0.60cents for the water...this not only left a bad taste in our mouths, we were prewarned of the charge.My take is for such an excellant restaurant, how can there be a charge for these items...
3
The menu is fixed and there is no Ala Carte form of ordering and this is one of my greatest disappointment. The presentation was great and the ingredients used are of quality indeed but just like the header of this post, maybe it's just me.I prefer the traditional Perenakan Food with the Chap Chye, Ayam Buah Keluah, Assam Fish etc. thus a fixed menu with no choices killed off my decision to come here again. Portion is too small for a guy.Time taken to serve was a tad too slow when the restaurant is not even full. If you really want to try a Michelin Star restaurant at a fraction of your pocket, you can try Candlenut but do not raise your hopes too high if you are looking for value for money kind of deal
5
A great dining experience in every way. The service with style and a smileThe food which offers variety of produce and flavoursThe atmosphere which is vibrantOnly thing I would look at is the down lighting which needs attention as it does not show off the cuisine in the manner it truly deserves Cheers
5
When I specified "peranakan" as my cuisine of choice to our host Dr Dennis, he said he knew just the place. How right he was (I've been periodically living in, and travelling to Malaysia and Singapore for 35 years so I know my flavours).If you relish degustation or tasting menus, then Candlenut is for you. It was a surprise and a great delight for an evening dinner. They had just introduced the idea of a set menu based on the availability of fresh market produce. For the three of us, we were served five starter courses of tasty vegetable and seafood bites. Five small mains followed, absolutely delicious flavours attractively presented. Many of the ingedients were unknown to me but I was delighted to make their acquaintance! I was the only one to seek a dessert, largely because my favourite of gula melaka was available - for many years it had disappeared off the Europe-centric local menus. It came topped with pandan jelly. Basic set menu around $65 per head ++. Well worth it
4
I've been to Candlenut a number of times since it first opened at Dorsett Residences, and my most recent visit was for lunch today. Given that it had recently been awarded 1 Michelin Star, it was much harder getting a reservation compared to a couple months ago. I also noticed more Caucasians there, being introduced by local hosts to Peranakan (Straits Chinese) food for the first time - which is a great way to raise awareness of our culture. Today, the standard of food and service was just as good as before. The waitstaff are friendly and willing to chat with you. We ordered the buah keluak (candlenut) since this was the dish the restaurant was named after. I have tried this dish at other Peranakan restaurants and still prefer the buah keluak in the form of a thick paste, rather than a gravy. But it was still tasty. The restaurant was able to cater for special requests. My husband is allergic to shellfish and we realised all the vegetable dishes had prawn paste or stock. Fortunately, the restaurant offered to cook the vegetables with garlic instead. The main catch for me is that Candlenut is on the pricier side, compared to other Peranakan restaurants. It used to have a more affordable set lunch menu but now, you have to order a la carte. Some dishes are above S$20 each. Overall, though, given the consistent standards of food and service, we will continue to make the occasional return trip to Candlenut
3
Went for lunch just a few days after they received the Michelin star. Not too sure if the Michelin inspectors are well versed in peranakan cuisine. I had the chicken buah keluak, which my table felt was a bit bland and lacking in flavor, the sambal sotong, which was overly spicy and salty. The chicken satay was decent. What impressed us was the desserts, the buah keluak ice cream was unique and complemented the caramel sauce well, and the durian dessert was very addictive. Overall around 40 dollars a head which is probably a decent price still for a Michelin starred restaurant but the food wasn't what I would expect from a Michelin star restaurant, having eaten at quite a few.
5
We found this place by lucky coinsidence and had a wonderful dinner, where we tasted the famous Peranakan cuisine for the first time.
5
Really impressive food here, I've been back a few times with friends and they would always love the experience! Authentic flavours, and with a shout out to the accommodating and friendly staff. Ive heard they might be moving to Dempsey, which is a pity as Dempsey is alot less accessible so I probably won't visit them as often. Do try this restaurant out before their relocation
4
Went there for dinner and really enjoyed the food. There is no fixed menu and the chef decides on the daily specials. So you must let them know about your food allergies or certain foods that you don't like. When we were there, they were very helpful in catering to our dietary requests. All in all, a very enjoyable experience

Candlenut is Singapore’s very own modern Peranakan restaurant, if you could call it that.Serving only a set menu for dinner, dish after dish, I was teased and tantalized by the delectable treats being placed in front of me.The “chef’s choice” dinner starts with 4 small snacks. Small as they were, they were punchy and filled with surprising twists. Pieces of bright orange cured trout fill a kueh pie tee shell, topped with a single laksa leaf – close your eyes and you might think you were eating laksa instead.A small and innocuous-looking crab cake, topped with Green Curry and Thai Basil, wakes your palate up immediately with a spicy kick.But my favourite of the snacks was the Wagyu Beef Satay. Marinated with a Buah Keluak Black Nut sambal, the bitterness of the nut disappeared into the caramelized sweetness of the grilled skewer and every piece of the tender wagyu beef was delish!For mains, 5 dishes are presented to you. We started with the Assam soup with prawn and mackerel omelette. Needless to say, the soup had just the right amount of sour and spice and the prawn was sweet and fresh.Now, I am a little squeamish when it comes to offal, but at Candlenut, they served a salad of Burnt Eggplant, Chicken Hearts, Roasted Chicken, Tofu and Cashews, and I loved the dish! Frankly, it was a “complete” dish – it had crunch, zest, spice and the chicken hearts are sliced small so it’s really not that intimidating to eat.Then there was the Charcoal Smoked Snapper with a green chilli relish and tempeh. The smoky aroma was evident and the earthiness of the tempeh added to the flavour even more.Now all this was served with steamed white rice, but of course, no white rice should ever be eaten without copious amounts of curry. Luckily, they were serving Rendang and Chicken Curry that night – so I could drown my rice in them the whole night long.The braised lamb shoulder rendang was the sweet kind – the green banana used probably added to the sweetness, so not the more robust rending you might be used to. By now, we were stuffed, but dessert was on the way. Now, if you do go to Candlenut, you must try the Buah Keluak Ice Cream. Don’t get me wrong, I am not a buah keluak maniac, and in fact, my first taste of the ice cream left me wondering how I was going to finish it all. BUT, when you mix it up with the luscious salted caramel chocolate sauce that it comes with, it will amaze you and it will all make sense. The Buah Keluak ice cream itself is mixed with rich Varlrhona chocolate, and the nutty flavours of the buah keluak and the cocoa are very much complementary. Together with the crumble for crunch and get this, fizzy pops, that will bring you back to your childhood, this is a very special dessert, indeed.All this, for just $60, in an ambience that is cheery with service that is equally bubbly, definitely worth trying out the “ah-ma-kase” dinner at Candlenut

Very interesting fusion food. Some Peranakan and Thai influences are obvious. Others are more subtle. Wagyu beef sate and wasabi topped crab balls. Amuse bouche coconut spoons of chargrilled octopus and (deliberately) burnt aubergine all with wonderful, fresh spices. Local and foreign beers from around the globe plus a decent wine list.

The whole was really good! I walk-in and told them i cant take seafood and they whip up a whole new set of menu without seafood on the spot to cater to me!!I really enjoy the service and the food as well.. the food are like tasting menu.. u get to try the different variety of peranakan food!A must try for people that like peranakan foo

Our party of 5 descended on the world famous contemporary Peranakan Cuisine Restaurant - 'Candle Nut ' for my first Peranakan dinner. Since both my wife and I were both new to this kind of cuisine, our expectation and anticipation were sky-high.Seated in a cozy side dining room, our slightly snobbish server rushed through the evening's tasting menu quickly and asked us to decide fast before the evening rush get started. With names of most ingredients and dishes foreign to my wife and I, we decided to let my foodie friend and wife to make all the decision on our behalf.When the food arrived, the contemporary and modern presentation was a huge surprise to us and a feast for the eyes. Taste-wise, most dishes were a concoction of very exotic flavoring combining whole suites of spicy, savory, sweet and tangy components in both the sauces and the chief ingredients. Some, we fell in love almost immediately, whilst some, we need a bit of time getting used to.My favorite taste profile was the sauce used for the fried Red Snapper. It was so tasty but unfortunately the over-spiciness started to kicked in after a while and my mouth turned into that of a Games of Throne fiery dragon! Hot! Hot! Hot! A must mention was the Beef cheek and tongue Buah Keluak Broth. Looking blackish and intimidating, the taste was actually surprisingly delicious and the meat texture, chewy but extremely tender. The King Prawn dish with its pineapple cream sauce was delightful as with almost all the desserts.All in all, a very interesting, exotic and enjoyable evening. Again, a big thank you to our generous host!PS: A copy of the menu is attached to provide more detailed description of the dishes and their exotic ingredients and sauces

Great menu with rich flavours, lovely presentation and warm service. They handle dietary restrictions very well. Don't mind paying for tap water too but they didn't serve it and only served bottled water which is less environmentally friendly. Usually, you need a large group to enjoy a big menu, so u can order many dishes and try everything. But in this case, even with 2 people, u get to sample lots of good food, so its great for small and big groups. :) Hope you find this useful! :

We decided to take my parents here while they were visiting in Singapore as Peranakan is a style of food which is unique to this region. We booked online (which was very quick and easy) and we received a confirmation call on the afternoon of the booking, they also informed me that that particular night was a set menu. I liked the set menu as it enabled us to talk and catch up and the food just came out. The food was nice and plentiful. A selection of 4 entrees, 5 sharing mains of good proportions and dessert. The chocolate mousse was very good!The wine selection was good and they also had a good selection of uncommon beers, not just the usual tiger / Heineken
4
My 2nd time here for dinner. The lighting is too bright and decor quite simpleFor dinner, they no longer have a la carte and only have set dinner of $60 which is fine. A selection of starters came , and some looked more Thai than peranakan . For the mains, they have chicken rendang curry, prawn, soup, fried squid. The chicken and prawn were good but very spicy. Soup was seafood broth and rather good. The fried squid was average Dessert was 1 choice only and the portions were small. They were unique and quite good - durian dessert, calamansi dessert etc

Went here with my dad and husband. The food flavours were good, sadly some of the ingredients seemed not quite fresh enough, especially the shrimps.

We hosted a lunch party for 20 in their private room and enjoyed great service and a good range of local dishes. Several of our guests mentioned that they'd hoped to try this restaurant and were really pleased with the food and overall experience. Most enjoyable. Thank you

They serve set dinner here $50 per person so I ordered 3 sets. Staff was very patient to explain to me on the type of dishes offered. Portion is sufficient ... Alas I'm nursing a bad throat so had to watch what I eat. Nice quiet place for a mea

Had a good first impression with the place. Staff was young and friendly n more importantly attentive. I had a day procedure and could not take spicy food. Viola my food was separately made n served to me only. Wow !!! Good portion for omakase style Peranakan food. Although water was charged at 0.60 free flow, they kept filling my glass. Well only grouch was the parking as we went on a Saturday night n finding a parking lot or nearby valet was a NIGHTMARE !

It's a restaurant that features the Peranakan cuisine. The set menu was well put together to give you a sample of the different flavors. I liked most of the dishes i tried. Nothing too exotic. The service was great! It's located right across the street from the Dorsett hotel. It's definitely worth a try!

Very impressive delivery of Peranakan inspired cuisine. Expect surprising dishes with well balanced favours. All food is served according to the size of the group and is meant for sharing. This is a great way to ensure that everyone gets their fair share of the delicious dishes they serve. Our menu was a medley of amazing bite-sized starters followed by a perfectly balanced between serving of main dishes; curry squid, wagyu beef, wing-bean salad. This is a must try-place

I've been here 8 times and the food definitely does wonders for me.As a fellow Singaporean, being able to consume such time-consuming food crafted by passionate young local chefs, is truly heartwarming.At the ridiculous price of $50+sgd, one gets to taste as many as 10 well thought out courses & canapes, pre-dessert, main dessert and their version of petit fours. I've told the manager multiple times that the pricing is too darn cheap! Their reply was they wanted to spread the passion for well crafted peranakan food in hopes people appreciated it more.I've dined all around the world in a ridiculous amount of places, it just doesn't do it for me. After being away for some time, i would always miss the food here.sidenote: To all the other guests/Singaporeans yakking away about the water issue, your 50sgd isn't that great, mind you. Stop being a frog in a well and start supporting local talents more instead of being typical cheapskates fixated on water.Best regards-Pissed off local

As a peranakan, I would say that this would be a pleasant experience for those who are not familiar with peranakan cuisine. Most of the dishes served were of acceptable standard but the one that stood out for me was the sambal king prawns - they were succulent and the sambal packed a punch. Of the 3 desserts, the coconut combo was the best. What I did not like was the charge for warm water. At the price of $50++ per pax, water should not be separately charged.
4
We had eaten at Candlenut several times in the past and were initially disappointed to learn that they were no longer offering an à la carte option at dinner - we finally got around to trying the new tasting menu and were happily surprised - a great selection of dishes showcasing the best of Peranakan cooking. S$50++ is good value for generous portions of great food.I would have given 5 stars but we too came up against the absurd 'we don't serve tap water' rule much criticised by earlier reviewers - I argued at length with the waiter, pointing out that we had already ordered beer and wine but did not want to buy bottled water. He eventually relented and served us with tap water but the management need to be aware that this type of pettiness is annoying enough to drive away regular customers no matter how good the food
4
The dishes were tasty but portions were small. The room was a bit impersonal and cold, but the quality of food made up for it. Worth a visit!
1
Doesn't matter how good the food is. Not serving tap water when serving spicy food gets this place an instant fail.
4
Loved the food, especially the gula melaka prawns and the roasted pork (Babi Pongteh). Very decadent and luxurious.

we decided to have a staycation in the centre of Singapore to celebrate our wedding anniversary and decided upon a visit to Candlenut (we'd previously visit when some friends left Singapore to return to Europe)As we booked the restaurant informed us that Saturday dinner had changed to a Tasting Menu format and asked if we were ok with the concept. We were and they supplied a menu and asked if we'd like any dishes substituted. As I can't eat mushrooms one dish was changed for something else in an efficient fuss-free manner.The food comes in three waves, firstly a selection of tasty appetisers, all of which were great, including Kueh Pie Tee (savoury prawn shells), minced pork in a lettuce leaf and chicken satay. Main courses were a selection of soups(containing the poisonous candlenut - Buah Keluak), pork, squid and huge tiger prawns (all were tasty and not too spicy). A choice of two desserts arrived with the Textures of Coconut doing what it said on the menu.in summary, great food, great service - a true taste of the far eas

Exquisite Peranakan food - they've only got a tastings menu now without any ala carte menu but the selection was delightful. All 3 dessert items on the menu were out of this world! And all the main dishes were hits! Just 2 minor gripes though. While the staff were polite and professional, they lacked warmth, tact and initiative: - The staff who pointed the toilet out to me did not warn me that the automatic tap wasn't working, so I ended up soaping my hands with no water to rinse :X I had to open the door with my elbow and get a staff to help. She simply told me 'oh not working use (bidet) hose'. I said 'you should have a sign!'. She said "yes 'there' -> pointing at a dainty note ON THE DOOR OUTSIDE telling patrons who would already be inside the toilet that the tap was faulty and that they should use the (BIDET) HOSE to wash their hands. That's kinda gross, especially since some people may use the hose for their intended purpose - to wash their behinds. But luckily the staff held it for me so I'm cool!  - For a considerably fine-dining place, I personally found the way the staff went around telling patrons that 'belachan is chargeable' or 'hot water is chargeable' abit tactless. Should put it across in a better way. However, all in all the food made up for the minor gripes - just be prepared to pay for the little extras you ask for, and don't use the toilet; and your visit would be perfect

Candlenut was my go-to place for the last two years. I brought all my food-loving friends there and everyone enjoyed the tasty Peranakan food that boasted of great finesse. There was heart and soul in the food. Naturally, when my husband and I returned today with a group of friends to celebrate a birthday, all of us had high expectations. This was also our first time trying their recently launched fixed menu (at $50++ per pax) and we were looking forward to what Chef Malcolm Lee had planned. The meal started on a high: the appetitisers/assorted canapes of warm minced pork relish, chicken satay, kueh pie tee and starfruit prawns were faultless.The mains were a mixed-bag:the pong tauhu soup (prawn & crab meatball in a shellfish bisque) was sensational - very fragrant, very hearty; as was the crab curry. We found the chup chye too sweet, the king tiger prawns overcooked (too tough) and the wagyu beef a waste in a stew of buah keluak sauce. Overall, there was just too much meat. It would have been more balanced with another vegetable dish. The desserts of chendol cream, buah keluak ice cream and textures of coconut were good, but not mind-blowing. It was also wonderful that the restaurant prepared a special dessert for my friend's birthday. What tipped the scales from "yay" to "nay" were two things: 1) Candlenut now charges $2 per saucer of sambal belacan (chilli paste) 2) Candlenut no longer serves regular/tap water. Only warm water (at $0.60 per glass) or really expensive still water in a bottle. In the words of our Peranakan friend, "Which self-respecting Peranakan restaurant doesn't serve sambal belechan?" It is also unacceptable for a restaurant in Singapore to not serve regular water. Even fine dining restaurants like Jaan and Labyrinth serve regular water (you even have a choice of chilled or room temperature). On what basis does Candlenut not serve water? The food is spicy and salty. It is only reasonable to serve water. Even if you were to charge $0.50 per glass, we would have paid (albeit grudgingly).A friend opined that she would have paid just $25 for this meal. I asked if serving chilli and water without additional charges would have made a difference and she said, "Yes, I would pay $35." This goes to show that some little touches would go a long way. For a restaurant that charges $50++ per pax for a fixed menu to be so fixated on the small-value items is bewildering. Candlenut claims to provide a Peranakan family dining experience, but I honestly cannot imagine a Peranakan grandma saying to her guests, "Oh, you want sambal belacan? That will be $2 a plate, please."Unfortunately, we will not be returning to Candlenut. At least not with this current philosophy and mindset. It is truly disappointing to see a once-great restaurant lose its soul and customer-focused approach. p.s.: We did, however, truly enjoy the humorous company of an elderly male server. He came over many times to talk about the dishes, share a joke or two and check in on us. Thank you, Uncle. You were the biggest highlight to our meal tonight

I was really looking forward to eating at Candlenut, having read many food reviews. However I was disappointed to find a restaurant space which did not have much ambience and seemed to have been fitted into an awkward area that the Dorsett Hotel did not know what to do with. The food was OK but not exceptional and there are definitely far better Peranakan restaurants which are also better value. The portions are quite small and especially given the price being charged. The wing bean salad was quite tasty but not very generous and the prawn was split in half and made to appear as there were twice as many. When we asked for chillies, we were told it was an extra charge of 2 dollars per dish. At the end of the meal I asked for some hot water (as I had a sore throat) and was told there was a charge of 60 cents. I can just about forgive the charge for the chillies but come on - this is part of the Dorsett Hotel - a charge for a cup of hot water at the end of a meal for 3 people, really?? The overall experience left a bad taste in our mouths and in more ways than one

We visited here on our second night in Singapore. I looked this place up on trip advisor and the cuisine intrigued me. It was fantastic. Service, starter, main, wine just brilliant. We visiting Thailand, Singapore and Dubai and this was best meal we had by far. If we ever return to Singapore we will definitely be back
5
We came here for dinner and they have a set menu. For four of us it is so much food. It was very good because : 1) Very nice to have diverse selection of food - we wouldn't normally get so much selection for only 4 pax 2) different way of doing the same things and amazing food a. Unique starter dish of prawn with laksa lead and star fruit - which my friends like b. Wagyu beef satay good c. Best dish of the night - buah keluar wagyu beef. Every bite was sublime d. Potato leaf and kang kong curry dish very good e. Chendol desert 3) the set menu does change accordingly.
5
Read about this restaurant in my European news magazine and wanted to try it immediately. Finally made it today and was not disappointed. It was lunch and they let us wait inside although we were there 30 minutes before opening time (12pm). The staff was very nice and helpful (as we were with a small child). Felix was great and recommended the right mix of different foods. We ordered a starter (Ngoh Hiang; crispy beancurd rolls with minced pork/prawn), some vegetables (Chap Chye; braised cabbage w/ mushrooms), the grilled pork cheek and Mum's Curry (with crabmeat).All dished tasted great. Mum's Curry is an absolute must-try and now officially my favourite curry in Singapore (just the right balance between spiciness and sweetness). The Ngoh Hiang came in second place for me, but then again everything was delicious and fitted well with our lemongrass-ginger drinks.A bit on the pricier side for an average Singapore lunch-meal, but worth every penny. Will definitely try to come back
5
This was the first time I had Peranakan food, and I loved how we got to try 4 different starters, main and desserts. The service was great, and the waitstaff keen to explain things to us.
4
I love Nyonya food, or Peranakan, whatever name it is. This was my second visit to the Candlenut after an amazing lunch last year. I was not disappointed, despite I found last time was more enjoyable. Mama's curry chicken and Assam Sotong were mouthwatering.
4
Candlenut has an exciting chef (Malcolm Lee) with a newly introduced tasting menu. We had dipping fish crackers, 4 starters, 5 mains, a palate cleanser (apple jelly) and a choice of dessert with petit fours.It was a great experience, with excellent service and lots of explanations about the dishes - highly recommended
5
My wife and I visited this restaurant on the 1st august after reviewing for a restaurant providing authentic cuisine before we travelled.We were advised whilst travelling that the menu had changed to a tasting menu from A La Carte I said thats fine but I personally do not eat fish.On arriving at the restaurant I went through the fact I didnt eat fish or shellfish and the chef prepared a separate vegetarian tasting menu whilst still providing the normal menu for my wife a she loves fish and seafood.An outstanding meal and were glad to take account of my dislikes.Very friendly too do not miss if you are visiting Singapor
3
The food is wonderful. However staff service is not up to any standards. Drinks were served wrongly, water was not refilled, things that suppose to help to keep in the fridge was left on the table.The service was much better from my previous visit however one can notice distinctly that e service is going downhill.Overall it is still a nice restaurant to go to for nice food. I heard there is a new set menu rolled out in august.
5
Do not come here looking for just traditional Peranakan cuisine. Do go to this restaurant if you are looking for a new experience in this popular cuisine and you will not be disappointed. Chef Malcolm had change his dinner concept and only served a set dinner highlighting all his best dishes("ahmakase menu") and all of us really enjoy the innovative twist in all the dishes presented to us. The surprise elements with familiar tastes in all the dishes works well from the first dish Buah Keluak Ox tail Soup to the amazing deserts including his fame Buah Keluak Ice Cream. His current pricing at S$50++for the set dinner is definitely very good value and I am surprise he is not charging more. Service was very friendly. The location of the restaurant is convenient but you may faced challenges in getting a car parking lot around the area during peak periods

My grandmother will probably disown me if she saw the above statement, but it's true. The cooking at Candlenut IS better than my grandmother or mother.  In our country where foreign chefs are highly celebrated, international 'best lists' nominating foreign cuisines and chefs to represent Singapore, one can't help but ask, where is the Singaporean chefs and restaurants? Alas, in came Candlenut, helmed by local Singaporeans, Chef Malcolm lee and restaurant manager Chan Jia min.I have travelled far and wide for food, multiple cities, dozens of michelin stars collected, yet there will always be a time i miss rice and curry. Whenever i am back home in Singapore, i crave for the food at Candlenut.Why? Because it is sincere, it is genuine, it is detailed. There is much thought put in to it, it is robust yet balanced. It shows finesse, it shows depth. it tells a story of heritage and progression. It feels like i'm dining with my friends and family.I dined at Candlenut on 6 separate occasions and each time, i hunger to return. I've tried both their previous ala-carte menu and their latest transition to a tasting menu, dubbed the 'Ahma-kase menu' (Ahma being grandmother).My absolute favorites from the ala-carte are the chicken satay, mum's curry, gula melaka king prawns, Buah keluak ice cream and textures of coconut. I can go on and on to explain every single flavor profile of each dish, but that would be unethical for me to spoil the surprise for you.The Ahma-kase was very very good too, $50++ per pax for approx 10 carefully cooked and plated dishes, is a GREAT steal. I've heard some people commenting on it being too expensive, to them i say, please eat out more often and stop embarrassing yourself, a plate of random aglio olio pasta can fetch $22, what's $50 for 10 detailed, carefully planned dishes?The pong-tauhu soup, vegetable curry with crispy whitebait and the grilled red snapper with dried shrimp sambal were stand-outs for me. The homemade kuehs at the end was a really nice touch to finish off my meal too. (Which restaurant makes their own kuehs nowadays?) I too shall not elaborate further on these dishes as the Ahma-kase menu changes regularly, depending on what Chef Malcolm can find daily at the wet-markets. It might not even be on the menu when you visit, but ain't that fun? Yes, service can be sketchy at times, but the young bright eyed service staffs reminds me of my younger days when i was working between school days, trying my best to provide the best service possible in my capacity. In fact, it's rather endearing for me. Who can fault them when they are so sincere and genuine? I'd much rather have Candlenut's team friendliness than polished robotic michelin servers.Chef Malcolm Lee aims to showcase Singaporean Peranakan food on the world stage, to push the boundary of the cuisine further, and in my humble opinion, he and his team are very much well on the way. Tourists, do pay them a visit when you're in town, take it from a Singaporean foodie. Forget what other 'best lists' tells you are must visit (i've ate all of them too), seriously, who flies thousand of miles to Singapore to have french/italian/any other random cuisine rather than Singaporean cuisine?Cheers

There are many Peranakan food places in Singapore but many of them serve rather generic Peranakan food that lack a bit of the real oomph that Peranakan food should have... leading to many who keep lamenting that the home cooked stuff is just much better. Home cooked is indeed better, but Candlenut does come close to getting a bit of the real character back. Granted, some of the dishes look and sound a bit different, but had a real kick!Highlights were the beef in buah keluak sauce (very nice), prawns with petai, mummy's curry. The ladies finger was also nice, but some were very fibrous despite supposedly being the really tender Indian variety. More average were the Pie Tee and Ngoh Hiang.One gripe I had was that they did not serve tap water - charge $1 for it if you must but please don't force us to buy environmentally unfriendly imported bottled water than consumed fuel to ship from Europe. Please. Service was good.If they had served tap water, I would have given 5* but that issue pushed it down 1 star

Selected by my local Singaporean foodie, who always comes up with delicious eats. Peranakan with a twist, each freshly prepared with care and presentation, slightly different than the typical Peranakan foods, such as the pork knuckle prepared just as at a German eatery, but with a Peranakan dipping sauce, absolutely delicious. Only con was the small portion sizes. Restaurant is easy to get to being on the Outram MRT station in the Dorsett Residences building
5
Came here with a group of colleagues for lunch. It is easily one of the best Peranakan meals I've had in a long time. Very authentic dishes (especially the Candlenut dishes, satay and grilled mushrooms) with nice wooden plates and bowls to match, nice ambience and attentive and hospitable staff! A must-try is the candlenut ice-cream. Sooo good. You won't regret it
5
Delicious Original nyonya food are now very hard to find in Singapore.
I am lucky my friend bring me there.
The ambience are cozy with lots of old type household appliances
5
It was our first proper Peranakan food in town. Our local friend tried to reserve the table for us since day 1 and finally we got a table on the last night we stayed in SG. The food is so great. everything is delicious.

Six of us dined at this stylish contemporary restaurant located in the Dorsett Hotel. We shared seven dishes, plus several bowls of rice... ample for the group. In retrospect, I wish I had researched the candle nut itself, prior to visiting: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleurites_moluccanus The sauces derived from this amazing nut are unique... tantalising... exceptional. Everyone enjoyed the meal. Prices are reasonable, even given the 20% ++ service/tax fee. Service was generally attentive and we appreciated a more experienced staff member's description of the nut and its origins and uses. So why only a '4' rating for an otherwise outstanding restaurant? I ordered a European shiraz ($68 + 20%). It arrived dripping with condensation. It was _ice_ cold. I requested instead _any_ of the European reds at room temperature. "They are _all_ served cold." We ordered beer instead. I suspect any suggestion made about serving red wines at room temperature will be ignored. This does, however help explain a lack of Australian reds on the wine list. No Australian winemaker would permit this sad abuse of a well-crafted red
4
So good to have a Peranankan restaurant so close to our hotel - the food was very good, tasty and had all the elements you would expect of this cuisine. The ambience is OK not bad, not great. Staff good - would I return - YES
5
Located directly across from my hotel, I was thrilled to find an authentic Peranakan meal. We had the pork appetizers in the crunchy cups, a pork belly dish in a rich curry, tender squid in a spicy sauce, crawfish with a unique black nut paste, and sambal vegetables. Every dish was interesting and different, and some (like the black nut sauce and pork curry) were absolutely unique and nothing like I've tasted before. It is a unique and complicated cuisine. My Chinese friend complained that he thought it was too heavy, but I didn't. Calamansi lime juice for beverage and an absolutely wonderful and light multiple textured coconut dessert made this a memorable evening. Pity the toilet was a bit shabby, considering the rest of the place was clean and tidy. The only negative is that it is a touch expensive, but most proper restaurants (not food courts) in Singapore usually are
4
I was there with two friends. We ordered omelette chincalok, candlenut satay (chicken), chap chye, buah keluak with chicken meat, tumeric wings to go with plain rice. We also ordered banana caramel pudding, chendol cream and textures of coconut as desserts. Looks like a lot of foods but the portions were small. They were just nice for the three of us who were not big eaters. The buah keluak gravy was tasty and we ate more rice as we wanted to finish the gravy. I also liked the satay as the chicken meat was tender and not fatty. The cost was a little bit expensive considering that the portion served was rather small
5
Business Associates gave "thumbs up" for the food. Recommended Wing bean salad -- wing bean crunchy & the sourish gave a slight punt to the taste buds. Crispy Pork and and Beef Rendang delicious enough to go back for more. Beef Rendang is yet soft and juicy.flavourable desserts to offer...uncommon and not readily found in Peranakan restuarants in Singapor

I would say that I was a fan of this restaurant since they were in the previous 'neil road' location. it was a small cosy shophouse unit but unfortunately they closed for almost 2 yrs before they re-open in its current 'dorsett residences' location. Was extremely happy for them and kept bringing different groups of friends to try their food during lunch and dinner timings. Everyone enjoyed the dishes here at Candlenut every single time and i had full confidence even when bringing people who've never tried peranakan cuisine. Business was booming and we all had to book in advance as the restaurant is usually fully booked. However, i was very disappointed on my most recent visit last week. The Ayam Buah Keluak's recipe changed to a diluted version, when it used to be so beautifully thick, smooth and rich in flavour. Yeye's Kari was also weak in its taste and spices (this was one of my favourites). Chap Chye dropped a notch in its flavour. Assam Fish - a little too sweet for my liking. Assam Sotong - no kick. Soups had also gone mild and diluted. What you can try : Desserts - Banana Cake, Gula Meleka Ice Cream with caramel sauce The Crispy Pork Belly was still good. Ngoh Hiang and Babi Ponteh were nice dishes on wmy earlier visits one but i didn't try it this time. Turmeric Wings - nice but not fantastic, turmeric spice didnt come through enough.Generally the service staff are polite but service level can be improved. There's only 1 staff who is passionate about the food they serve, so you can feel it in her when she takes your order, and i think that makes a pleasant difference
4
This seems to be a popular place, so it's probably wise to book in advance. Enjoyed very much the entree I chose - a spicy lamb shank rendang. The accompanying vegetable dish (mushrooms) was bland and unmemorable. I agree with other reviewers that Candlenut's prices are a little too high given the overall standard, but it's worth a visit. Service is prompt, efficient, and quite friendly
5
The dinner visit on 15 May was a repeat after visiting it for the first time with business associates 2 days earlier. I have found some lost and forgotten flavours from my late grandmother's cooking. No, I am not a Peranakan but she was a great cook. So is my mum!I love the Ngo Hiang (meat roll), Bakwang (meat ball soup), Crabmeat curry, chicken satay, chap chye (braised cabbaged) and layers of coconut (dessert). The chendol cream, this is not to be mistaken for the chendol with shaved ice, is DIVINE~~!!!!!Looking forward to my 3rd visit at month end
4
Food is really tasty; in fact, I prefer this place to Blue Ginger. At the Dorsett, conveniently located near hip bars in case you want to go for drinks after.
3
Had to wait quite long for our table, and service was quite slow. The food was typical peranakan dishes, nothing particularly memorable. And the portions could have been bigger to make diners leave with a filled stomach.
4
Peranakan fusion at its best! The food was so delicious and tasty. The duck and salted vege soup reminded me of my childhood! Staff were very accommodating but some were overtly abrupt and tried to clear plates when we were still eating.

We loved this place. We dined early, as it is usually full and you would otherwise need to book.We had a very helpful and knowledgeable waitress - but found the other staff also very pleasant and attentive.The dishes we loved best were the wing bean salad, the sambal barramundi and the ngoh hiang bean curd roll. My wife found the buah keluak wagnu beef ribs tasty but a little too strong for her

We visited this restaurant to celebrate our son's 25th birthday, and it turned out to be a great choice for lunch. The ambience was great for a delightful meal and comfortable for family conversation. The cooking style was Straits Chinese and the quality was good. We ordered our favourite local dishes of ngoh hiang, sayer lodeh, buah kelak with wagyu beef rib, and coconut charcoal grilled wild caught red snapper. For dessert, we made a daring attempt to try the buah kelak ice cream with valhorna chocolate. Prices were reasonable but portions were a bit small; we didn't mind as it gave us a chance to try a greater variety of different Peranakan dishes. Recommended for a family meal to celebrate special occasions

Came here after my husband and I had a horrible experience at Pappa San, the Dorsett Hotel Restaurant. This was such a saving grace! The food was flavourful and though it was spicy, it was really enjoyable. The staff were also courteous and warm, even though they seemed understaffed and really busy. Overall a good experience for the local fare of Singapore, just be warned to load up on the iced water

Went there for dinner on a Saturday night. You need to book a table as it's not a big place. Service was ok, food was average at best. Portions are small, the food is presented well but lacked flavor. Don't think that I would return. Not worth the money
3
The four of us ordered (1) Kueh Pie Tee (2) Ngoh Hiang (3) Wagyu Buah Keluak (4) Babi Pongteh (5) Sambal Stir Fried Baby Sweet Potato Leaves (4) Yellow Nanas curry, plus for dessert (5) Buah Keluak with Valhorna choc and (6) Chendol. Even with white rice, there was hardly enough for 2 guys and 2 ladies. When we finished, we were almost told to leave as they said a queue was building up. Highly unlikely to come back, as there are better Peranakan restaurants (with better service) in Singapore
4
Apart from the Four Seasons Hotel group, I personally have not encountered such quality service from anywhere else in Singapore. I can't speak for the rest of the service staff but we were lucky to be served by Amos, who was discreet yet attentive and had the initiative. I accidentally scratched my finger against the wall and bled and he came up with a plaster without even me asking. When I had the runs, he noticed and pointed me to the restroom even before I could ask. When we needed ice water, he overheard and brought it to our table even before we requested.As for the food, the Tumeric Wings and the Babi Pongteh are a must-try. The Tumeric Wings were very crispy yet moist. The Babi Pongteh was really tasty, the Sayur Lodeh was really rich and the Assam Sotong was really appetising with the tang from the tamarind. However, the Kueh Pie Tee was disappointing, quite tasteless! If you love Durians, the Durian Soup dessert is divine
3
I was a special occasion for us and consequently, I reviewed many restaurants online in Singapore before deciding that this would be the one. To sum up the whole experience, it was nothing special at all. The restaurant itself is plain, the service was ordinary, food was average and for what there was, it was expensive. We definitely wouldn't dine there again
4
I love Peranakan food! And this is a modern variation in a way? Delicious.
And what I like most is I can just call up for takeaways and park my car outside and run in to collect.
5
We love this unique cuisine and the Candlenut chef is producing these classic dishes with new vigor. The service was perfect and the atmosphere is upscale and pleasant.
4
Tonight we had a fantastic diner at Candlenut, being a huge fan of Peranakan cuisine, i can absolutely recommend this restaurant.
Although it is modern fusion peranakan cuisine, the flavors are wonderful, the staff is great and the ambience nice.

I ate at "Candlenut" for dinner one evening whilst on a 3 day trip to Singapore. This restaurant is easy to find as it is next door to the Dorsett Hotel on New Bridge Road and is a 2 minute walk from Exit H of Outram Park MRT Subway Station.Peranakan cuisine combines Chinese, Malay and other influences into a unique blend and it is only my second time eating it but it is delicious. (The first time was also in Singapore at another nice restaurant called "Blue Ginger" - See my review here on Trip Advisor also).Candlenut is a reasonable sized restaurant with two dining areas separated by the entrance/reception area. It is quite simply decorated but it is comfortable and relaxing. The menu has a great selection of dishes, I choose classic 'Satay Skewers' to start with and they really were superb, the satay sauce had some pineapple puree in it and it gave it a unique and beautiful twist and a bargain at just SG$10.0 (about GB£5). To follow I had the 'Mums Curry' which was a kind of Red Curry made with Chicken Thighs (bone in) and potato. Again this was very tasty (it would have been even better if boneless in my opinion) and also very reasonable at SG$16.0 (about GB£8). It came with steamed rice which was what the waitress called 'free flow', that is you can get free refills as much as you want. I had a dessert also and opted for the 'Caramelised Banana Pudding'. This was a steamed banana cake, with brown cane-sugar ice-cream and a fresh caramelised banana... It was divine and one of the best pud's I've had in ages in a restaurant. This was again a bargain at just SG$10.0 (GB£5). Drinks were a bit more pricey, I had one bottle of local Tiger Beer and that was SG$10.0... So that is about GB£5 for a 330ml bottle of beer which seems a little too high to me.In short the food in "Candlenut" was superb and all at a very reasonable price. The chef came out at the end of my meal and it was nice to speak to him about the 'Mums Curry'. I would certainly recommend this restaurant and would like to eat here again one day
4
Two of my favorite dish here is their Crispy Pork Belly and Yeye's Curry. The first one for being a great combination of tasty juicy pork and crunchy crispy skin. Don't forget to ask for their good pairing Chincalok sauce. The second one for its thick and creamy taste that makes you crave for more. Price is acceptable for a modern restaurant, although service could be better for the price paid
4
The flavours were very good. Everything was presented in a modern way but the flavours were still connected with tradition. Among the good dishes I had were the Ngoh Hiang, Mum's curry and the signature Buah Keluak chicken dish. Desserts were good too.Will come and visit some time again
5
Having been to Asia many times, I am always keen to try different cuisines. This was my first Peranakan restaurant and I'd advise you go there asap before chef Malcolm Lee moves on. The food provided tastes and textures of a very high level at a very affordable price. Service was great, fast and courtesy of Ling very entertaining. I will try and get you Mr Lee's recipe book unless you get me one first !!! Anyway, the Chicken Buah Keluak was rich, dark, bitter, sweet and perfectly complimented by the zingy wing bean salad. The Red Snapper was ferociously so the iced water came as a relief. The Buah Keluak dessert just played tricks with your palate. Again, the black nuts provided the base to a rich chocolate ice cream which was set on a bed of salted caramel. Add a dash of chilli and chocolate crumble and my mouth was singing. We then had the textures of coconut which cleansed the palate perfectly. A wonderful gastronomic experience
2
food is not as good as I can write in other opinions. It is not bad but just tasteless and not inspired. They say they serve a kind of fusion but result is poor. Service was nice but very slow and not professional- we were waiting for 30 min for first dish and the of course everything came at once so finally everything was cold. Toilets like at street food bar which you can find plenty in the neighbourhood and with not worse quality. Total disappointment and very expensive one
3
In relation to the price the food just average. Very good salad and curry, beef and cabbage totally untasty. Beer not cold enough. The most annoying was waiting for half an hour for any food (not even a starter was offered). They gave neither chopsticks nor knife for eating - fork onl
5
So good, we ate here twice!This is a fantastic restaurant for two main reasons.Firstly the food is wonderful. We tried the chicken with candlenut, lamb rendang , squid in squid ink and the barramundi. All were beautifully cooked and presented, full of spicy flavour and generous portions. The star of the meal was the wing bean salad which perfectly complemented the main courses. We tried four desserts - coconut, durian fruit, chocolate and banana - all terrific.The chef, who we briefly met, is clearly a thoughtful and passionate chef.The spanish house wine suited the food perfectly.Secondly the service was absolutely superb from all. Knowledgeable, very friendly and excellent ambassadors for the food. It is very rare for restaurant staff to speak so warmly and proudly of the chef and his food.Prices - very reasonable.Do try - it's wonderful
4
We wanted to try local cuisine so chose this place. Exemplary service and the food was well prepared but unfortunately I just couldn't wrap my tastebuds around most of it. The desert was outstanding though!
5
What a delight to discover such tasty, authentic Peranakan cuisine. Every dish was yummy and the bill very reasonable. Great find!
5
We had a very pleasant surprise at the candlenut. The food was a fantastic blend of old and new singaporian styles. The service was attentive and helpful. The taste was a subtle blend of spices with just the right amount of heat. The garlic squid and coconut crab curry were delightful. The wing bean salad was fresh and crunchy. The chef special char grilled snapper was a real treat. The chef was also friendly and was happy to speak about the food afterwards. The shared chocolate dessert was a perfect way to round off the meal.Well done guys
5
I love Peranakan food, so when we asked the concierge about a good local restaurant and they suggested Candlenut, I was surprised upon arrival that Candlenut is a sleek, modern, restaurant...rather than the homey type Peranakan restaurants I'd been to in the past. It turned out to be one of the best meals I've had in Singapore (and that's saying a lot!). First, let's talk about the service. Amazing. I wish I would have asked the name of our server because she was really top notch. She had short hair and glasses and was a bit older than the other ladies working in the dining room. She was SO knowledgeable and patient with our questions. She even brought out a Wing Bean from the kitchen to show us what it looked like...given we had never seen one before (by the way, it was delish!). The food was outstanding. I had the lamb shank Rendang. The meat fell off the bone it was SO tender and delicious. That was our server's suggestion. Perfectly spicy and yummy! My wife is a vegetarian and they put together something delicious for her, since she doesn't eat any fish stock or anything like that, which accompanied a number of the other vegetarian dishes. Another excellent effort. For dessert, the Buah Keluak is not to be missed. I'm pulling this directly from the menu "Rich and earthy buah keluak ice cream, made with 80% Valhrona chocolate - on a bed of salted caramel, chocolate crumble & chilli specks, topped with warm milk chocolate espuma." Argh!!!! SOOOO good....and the perfect size. Not some gigantic dessert that makes you overstuffed. After dessert, our wonderful server brought the chef over to our table for a quick chat. He was such a very nice person...and it's always interesting to know more about what you're having. I give this restaurant an A+. My favorite meal of our visit! Great service from everyone there and food that amazed

Recently had dinner at this restaurant and had a really nice evening. Service was attentive and the welcome warm. Its a popular restaurant so recommend booking. We got a table on our second attempt. Its located opposite the entrance to the Dorsett Hotel and a few minutes walk from Outram Park MRT. It has a minimalist feel to it, is modern in design, and the food is Peranakan cuisine. The menu has a good selection to choose from. We had three courses.Our starters were Bakwan soup (Crab meatballs & bamboo shoots in a chicken broth) and chicken wings marinated in turmeric. The main offerings were a Lamb Rendang and Mum's Curry (chicken in red curry with potatoes and lime) mmmmm. Delicious.Our desserts were Durian soup (ice cream with durian puree) and Buah Keluak (an earthy dark chocolate ice cream with chilli specks, salted caramel and warm milk chocolate) heaven.A wonderful meal, no rush, and washed down with a couple of Tiger beers and bottled water.Great value as well as the total bill including service was $112. Certainly will return when next in Singapore
5
What a wonderful experience lunch was, great service, interesting and delicious menu that was stylishly presented and complimented by a great beer list.I didn't even get to the wine list. We thought we had no room for dessert and just looked at the menu.Just had to have the 80% chocolate ice cream, salted caramel chilli creation, and so glad we did, world class! We made a reservation straight away for dinner on our way to the airport to further sample the menu.Sublime.

My friend and I were visiting Candlenut on 16th December 2014 and honestly said, we encountered some bad issues and good things. Kinda sad, We had not so good first impression to the restaurant as the hostess seemed did not really welcome us. We were slightly late from our appointment and we apologized as it was kinda hard for us to find the restaurant. Hostess remained silent and smile and looked like she didn't give a damn on what were we talking.  I was feel ashamed with my friend, who was previously a hotel restaurant manager and has travelled all the way from Shanghai, as he felt displeasure and uncomfortable in the first place. SERVICE: server who served the food, a.k.a runner, was somewhat harsh. A little bit harsh and rush in serving the foods. He has successfully surprised us with the loud voices whenever he served the foods. truthfully saying, somehow we feel irritated with it. Server -We was delighted with the service and the server, who named Yessica Suriya, has mannerly served us as the customers. it began when we asked for food recommendation and before she recommended the foods, she asked for our food preferences and allergies. As a restaurant manager of five stars hotel in his previous career, My friend said he was impressed with the girl first question as it was very rare to hear it as the first question and it indicated the server has showed care towards the customers. it's a good thing to know the customers needs and allergies before you recommended a food.Yessica personality is confident, warm and cheerful which has successfully made the guest feel appreciated and welcomed. She is communicative and when she found out there were some issues that caused us felt displeasured, she sincerely apologized and tried to divert our attention regarding the displeasure. to be honest, her communication skills has implicitly taken our displeasure away.FOOD The foods were delicious and suit our tastes. The desserts were beyond expectation. Buah Kluwak Ice Cream and Durian Soup were superb. Round applauses for the chefs especially the dessert's chefLOCATION slightly hard to be found

Peranakan food is one of my favorites. However my first few tries here, I found some of the experimental fusion flavors were not to my taste. Today, the intensity of authentic flavors had greater appeal. The kueh pie tee - jicama stuffed into crisp shells tasted good, however the slicing was too coarse and strips too long and did not fit the shells well. Some of the usual condiments to top it off were also missing.Candlenut is Buah keluak and the buah keluak pais was amazing - however it should be served with thin melba toast or crisps. To warn, this dish is presented as a thin black strip of pate?The chicken buah keluak had the intense flavors, as did the buah keluak ice cream(yes, a dessert) which may be a misnomer. More of a chocolate ice cream with chocolate sauce and buah keluak sprinkles? Chocolate and buah keluak "pairing" is growing on me.Back to the food- Lor Bak, basically braised soy sauce pork was also rich in flavoring. Chap Chye- mixed veggies consisting mostly of cabbage - great flavor but low on the diversity of veggies usually found in this dish, also not well sliced. They're not bite sized or soft enough.Then there were prawns, can;t remember the name except it had "King Prawns" in it. The waiter suggested we substitute with regular prawns which turned out to be a good suggestion for us as there were many more than 2 large prawns for the 3 of us. Again great flavor.The other dessert we had can;t remember name except it had coconut ice cream and jelly was also delicious.For drinks, the ginger and lemon grass was well - almost tasteless. The fresh young coconut was more refreshing, however the coconut flesh was a bit too hard to be scraped off to eat.Decor - light peranakan touch with lots of windows was pleasant. I recall it was noisy at night.Parking can be a problem, as is driving access. One drives down Bukit Pasoh Road, while Dorsett Residences sits on corner of Cantonment and New Bridge Roads

I've been back to this restaurant three times in the last two months; that speaks volume about the quality of food at this place. Conveniently located just a stone's throw away from Outram MRT, this place serves up a modern take on peranakan food. Some of my favorites are the pongteh, a braised pork dish, and the petal prawns cooked with sambal. Portions are hearty without being overwhelming. I would recommend going in a group so that you can sample a variety of its dishes. As for desserts, its buah keluak ice cream is an ingenious reimagination of what is traditionally a savory dish. I would recommend this place for first time diners to peranakan cuisine, as well as seasoned diners looking for a fresh take on peranakan food
5
This restaurant is really good for its food and service. The Peranakan cuisine is very interesting and delicious with mix of Chinese, Indian, Thai and Malays influence. The staffs are lovely and willingly to help and explain the food. But the real kill of this place is its desserts, just simply mouth-watering. Will come again for sure. Recommend Satay Ayam, Babi Pongteh, Nho Hiang and Buah Keleuk Ice Crea
4
Service and atmosphere ok, but impressive quality of served dishes. As this restaurant closes at 10pm, they kick you out 5 minutes before - little strange.....
5
My friends and I decided to try this place since we were looking for Peranakan food in the area. It's a little difficult to find (look for the Dorsett Residences), but once the food arrived, we were not disappointed in the quality of the menu items. Tried a lot of different dishes - rending, ayam buah keluak, ngoh hiang, chap chye, choking sotong (very spicy) - everything tasted amazing! Would definitely recommend this place if you are looking for Peranakan food outside of the Katong area of Singapore. Fresh coconut juice was also good
5
We stayed at the Dorsett Hotel and walked past this place for a few days. There is nothing about it that would draw you into the place but we went in for dinner and were totally blown away by the awesome food. If you are afraid of spicy food this may not be the place for you but if you are looking for beautiful curries, and authentic flavours this place is a must. We ate one entree and 3 mains between 2 people (we couldn't get through all of them) and the bill was half our previous night dining on Clark Quay (possibly over priced tourist trap). Eat here you will not regret it. Just wished I was in town longer so I could go back
4
Have been wanting to visit this restaurant for a year and finally got an opportunity. Went with a big group of 9 so it was good we get to try plenty of dishes. The decor is quite plain, but okFor appetizers we had the kueh pie to and it was good. For the mains, we had the buah keluat, lamb shank, chap chye and spicy squid. All were good, but most of us were stunned by the spiciness of the squid, and not in a good wayDessert options were the unusual buah keluat ice cream, chendol and a kind of banana dessert. All were good except I didn't taste the buah keluat in the ice creamService was good too, except near the end where we couldn't get any attention to get the billDefinitely worth repeat visit
5
This restaurant was a great little find for us thanks to the reviews on Tripadvisor. The food was great particularly the Buah Keluak and the wing bean salad. The staff were really helpful explaining the menu as we had not tried a lot of the dishes before. As we are interested in cooking and also growing a lot of our spices and veg the chef Malcolm Lee came out and gave us some very helpful tips and advice and even emailed us the next day with a list of where to get the seeds from. Would certainly visit again if back in Singapore and would recommend to anyone
5
This was my first time trying Peranakan cuisine, so I was unsure about what to order. We ended up ordering the Buah Keluak and the Mum's Curry. Both of which very good, but the Buak Keluak (chicken) has a pretty distinct appearance but once you get past it's looks, it actually tastes good. The service was good and while it has a little more upscale place, the hostess was nice of us to take us in even though we had our walking/casual clothes from sight seeing the whole day. This place is a must if you are looking for some authentic Singaporean food with a nice ambience
5
If you want to experience a wonderful example of this fairly unknown style of cuisine - Candlenut is the place to go. The modern, understated decor ensures that the dining experience is all about the food. Wonderful spiced flavours and the Team are very happy to guide you through the experience. Chef Malcolm Lee is one of Singapore's rising stars, so go and discover this hidden ge
4
Set right next to Outran Park MRT and next to the Dorsett Residences, this is a nice Peranakan restaurant. We had the Kueh pie Teh (top hats) and the turmeric chicken wings for appetizers, which were great. For mains, I had the Mum's curry (chicken), which was very flavorful in a yellow sauce. The Buah Peluak, chicken with the black nut sauce was highly recommended and very very good
5
Perfect place for a birthday meal. The new takes on traditional Singapore food are delicious. The chicken curry was very tangy and so packed with flavor and was delicious covering rice and potatoes. The lamb shank was also amazing. The crispy skin and spicy sauce melted in my mouth. The chicken wings were also quite the standout with a mild amount of spice, but great crunchy skin. Best of all, it is BYOB for wine.
5
Ordered Kueh Pie Tee for starter, sambal stir fry, babi pongteh (pork belly with soy beans gravy), buah keluak chicken (chicken cooked with black nuts gravy), bakar fish, and gula melaka king prawns for main course, and chendol cream and buah keluak for dessert! All tasted rich and yummy. My fav is the babi pongteh.Rice is free flow so good for carb lovers.The buah keluak dessert is really interesting :)))
4
Went there for dinner with the family and I must say the food lived up to our expectations! Really tasty dishes and the free flow rice was a nice touch.
The durian dessert is a must order, perfect way to end the meal!
4
I went to this restaurant thrice and every time I was happy with both the food and the service. In particular, I like the Sambal Timun, stir-fried sweet potato leaves with sambal, Beef Buah Keluak, Grilled Pork Cheek and the Lor Bak. The Assam Sotong was good too and it would be better if there was more squid than chilli in the dish. I prefer this restaurant to other Peranakan restaurants because I find that they are clever in the use of spices - just enough to tantalise your taste buds. Service was prompt and attentive
5
This is the best Peranakan restaurant in Singapore, which means it is probably the best Peranakan restaurant in the world. It is in a spacious, starkly modern new location, many times larger than the first time I went. Their classic dishes, like black nut chicken, are still available, but have been augmented by what I would consider "Nouvelle Peranakan", like rare duck breast rendang. The black nut prawns and the grandfather's minced pork white curry were both extraordinary. The wing bean salad was a marvelous marriage of different textures and flavors, which complemented each other rather than fought with each other. They have without a doubt the best beer list of any Peranakan restaurant; you can always have a Tiger, of course, but you can also choose a great Belgian like a Westmalle or a Rochefort. I have reviewed over 1300 beers online and have tasted perhaps 1,600 different beers in my travels, but their beer list had four Japanese beers I had never heard of. Their Japanese IPA was perfect with spiced food.A word about spiced. Their food is intensely spiced but not intensely hot. The flavors are complex and deserve attention; they are not hidden under waves of simple fire.There was one review posted earlier describing a terrible experience one reviewer had had at the restaurant. Just before I left I asked the manager about the review and she remembered the experience all too well. Without being defensive, but obviously with some embarrassment, she described the dinner's experience and what she learned from it. She now ensures that she NEVER has a shift staffed entirely with new personnel. I would not discount the reviewer's review or ignore his unpleasant experience, but I am happy to say you are unlikely to have to endure anything like it if you go.My bottom line is that this is the best Peranakan restaurant in the world, with a great menu and a great beer list
4
A friendly, modern place on the edge of Chinatown (a great walk from the Fullerton to sharpen up the tastebuds) - good food, and attentive service - our waitress helped to ensure we didn't over-order! We particularly liked the wing bean salad - a new taste experience for us
5
This is one of the rare restaurants offering authentic Peranakan food, which is very labor intensive and the pastes and sauces take ages to prepare properly. We had kueh pai tee, tumeric chicken wings, pork wrapped in tofu, beef rendang, squid in its own ink, nonya fish curry, chendol and the chocolate dessert. Everything was excellent. Service was a little slow given that the restaurant was full. Portions are a bit on the small side, but prices are also reasonable and this allows one to try a few of the dishes. Overall it was a great experience and one I will be repeating in due course
5
Great food with all kinds of exotic side dishes and small plates. The place had a really simple setup, but hey it works cos you're there for the food, not for the decor. Service was rather slow though cos they seemed to be shortstaffed. Nevertheless, the service crew were still helpful when it came to giving recommendations on the food items. My pals and I don't take that much spice, so wish they'd given us a major headsup about that first though!Yummy food, great place for an exotic and authentic local meal
4
We dinned here during a stopover in Singapore and were not disappointed with the food. We booked but I'm not sure this was necessary as they did not seem overly busy, the food was very good and after a lunch at a hawkers market seemed pretty authentic. The presentation was excellent but the service was not great but by no means poor just average. The restaurant was clean and modern and had a great push button to call a taxi after the meal. If you're looking for a pleasant meal that doesn't break the bank this would be a great choice.
4
Chef and his friends established this traditional recipe menu in a casual contemporary setting and it Wortham very well. The chicken with the drop brown candlenut sauce is delightful. The shrimp with petai beans spicy and superb. The shrimp in coconut sauce delicious. Every dish was hot fresh delicious. We ordered all four desserts and ate every smidgen. ... delicious! To earn the extra star. ..I would suggest a slightly more attention server and better table settings. Otherwise. .... you should go!
4
Wanted to sample the cuisine from this fascinating culture on my last night in Singapore. I had originally chosen another restaurant but they couldn't seat us until late. This restaurant is located next to a hotel. Be prepared to pay more for silver service especially compared to what you can get from Hawker centres. We ordered the Satay, Babi Ponteh, Bua Keluak and Sayar Lodeh. The satay was very disappointing. Not much flavour although the peanut sauce was delicious. The rest of the dishes were exceptional and very tasty though.
4
Candlenut is quite popular and they are often full. A reservation is recommended. Service was polite and good - the attendants were helpful and we received service with a smile, which is a plus.The food was quite expensive. $20 for a plate of rendang, which had about 4 medium pieces of beef. However, the meat was tender and melted in my mouth. It wasn't overly spicy either.I also ordered the satay, which was 4 sticks for about $12. The meat again was flavourful and tender, not tough like the ones you get at Hawker stalls.However, I did find the food a tad too salty and I couldn't find very many low salt, low spice options for my parents who are in their 60s.Overall, Candlenut is a nice place to try good quality peranakan food
3
We orderd a couple of the signature fares here and weren't disappointed as they were flavourful, though really spicy. The desserts here were good too, but I guess the whole experience was rather tainted by the fact that they were severely understaffed, and service was slow. The girl (I presume is part-time) took our orders, made us repeat it twice, and still got the order wrong. There was no manager to be seen on the floor, and they seemed to have left the part-time wait staff on their own
4
I was pleased after a long day to discover Candlenut literally across the concourse from my hotel. And I was doubly pleased to be able to sample a really unique local cuisine during my brief stay in Singapore. The simplicity of the restaurant was matched by the warmth of the welcome and arriving at 8pm with no reservation was no problem. The restaurant was pleasantly buzzy and obviously people were enjoying g themselves.As I was dining solo I asked for advice to ensure I sampled the signature dishes. Personally I couldn't resist the wing bean salad - a light, tangy combination of green beans, prawns, cashew nuts, lime juice, mint and coriander. Utterly delicious. I had this with the house speciality - beef Buah Keluak. What looked dark and daunting was rich, smooth and unlike anything I had ever tasted. A must have.Service was friendly and efficient and the drinks and meal arrived quickly. It was a thoroughly positive experience. If you are staying at the adjacent Dorsett Hotel you will get a 10% discount. Just another reason to enjoy
4
We like to find interesting local food wherever we go, but were in the mood for something a bit nicer (and cooler) than the outdoor hawker centers in Singapore. Candlenut to the rescue! No reservation, but they found us seats immediately. The staff took the time to explain the Peranakan ingredients and traditional foods so that we could order more knowledgeably. We truly enjoyed the pork belly and the prawns which were each cooked in unique sauces with such exotic ingredients as candlenuts (hence the name) and sambal. There were spicy and mild dishes to please any palate. These are rather small plates - a bit more food than a typical tapas plate but less than a full dinner order - so be aware that you may want to order 3 to 5 dishes for two of you. The wine was adequate but not exceptional; the service attentive; the atomosphere pleasant (hooray a/c!); the price reasonable for Singapore. All in all, we enjoyed a unique cuisine, well-cooked and delicious. Candlenut made it easy to be more adventurous with the palate without the fear of mysterious ingredients! Bravo
5
Fantastic place to bring someone to if you want to introduce them to peranakan food but want a restaurant type setting. I went with Singaporean friends and we'd all grown up eating plenty of peranakan food and the food here was really fantastic. Standouts were the Buah Keluak, Pork Belly and Assam Sotong, we ordered one each of all the desserts and they were delicious, the buah keluak ice cream one being particularly enjoyable, the chilli flakes creating a rather astonishing combination of flavors in the mouth that id never experienced before, slightly befuddling but also entirely welcome. the dining atmosphere was also extremely comfortable, previous reviews mention it being too brightly lit, that wasnt my experience at all, and the service was very attentive and friendly
3
Tried this establishment with a friend who has some craving for some good Peranakan food and after some very good review. Babi pongteh - good taste and reasonable portionkueh pie too - averageAssam Sotong - quite goodSambal lady's finger(okra) - well executedCendol - super small portion and very average tasteMango snow flake dessert - refreshingService - pretty goodAmbience - good Location - easily accessible via train/bus/cab/walk worth a try but not likely to go again
4
Didn't realise we had such a gem so close to our hotel. It looked quiet every time we went past but that was quite a bit later at night. Decided to try and totally glad we did. The food was delicious. Special mention to the stinky beans. They were the bomb. Service very attentive and definately reccomending this eatery to anyone traveling to Singapore.
4
This is my second visit to Candlenut, this time with friends from out of town and we enjoyed the food very much. We ordered the wagyu beef buah keluak, crispy pork belly, "yeye's curry" and the baked fish served with white rice. Everything was delicious, fresh tasting and done with a slight twist. If you order the baked fish, watch out for the chilli as it is very spicy. We did not have dessert this time but I tried the chendol and buah keluak ice cream before and it's definitely worth a taste for its sheer uniqueness.As several people have pointed out, the service can be slow and should be improved. However, the staff are genuinely friendly and are helpful when you do get their attention. Candlenut has a great menu with variety and the food quality is consistently good. If you are looking for a simple place to eat at with great food at good value, this is a place to consider for your next meal out

We went with a group of friends and one of them was a bit of a foodie so he did the ordering. Everything looked and tasted great. Because there were 6 of us, we managed to order lots of dishes and had a good variety. Service was on the slow side, but not overly so.However the next day, both my sister and I had food poisoning. Not sure if it was from this meal, and we can't say for sure. But it happened the next morning, right after we ate there. Luckily it went away after about 24 hours

We really enjoyed the food here, we came as a group of 4 and shared dishes which worked well and meant we tried lots if different things. Can recommend the swimmer crab curry and the mums curry but all the dishes we tried were good. We found it to be good value. The only thing was the service was a bit slow and we did wait quite a long time to order. Overall a good meal

i am visiting Sg with my family and a local friend recommended this restaurant for us. The food was perfect and the service was good. I asked a staff who can speak Chinese to give more detail about the dishes to my family, and she did a really good job. She was patient and friendly to answer all our questions. We had a wonderful night there, well done

Food are well prepared. Service is good. Highly recommended the satay, beef randeng, coconut prawn. The dessert is very nice too.

- Food was delicious, but portions weren't big.
- Service was friendly.
- The place itself is clean, comfortable, spacious and contemporary.

Visited this restaurant over restaurant week. The food was generally average based on the 5 of us choosing different set menus for lunch. The beef rendang was excellent. They should make an effort to serve the rice hot as the cold rice was dry. The chendol was absolutely delicious. Pricing was fairly reasonable.

Was visiting a friend in Singapore and she had suggested this place. Turned up with a reservation for 6 but only 4 of us which was no problem. Sat down at our table and were only given 3 menus? Had to ask for another. One of our party was thirsty so asked if they could have a glass of water to the person seating us,who acknowledged, then went away and brought a glass. After a while another member of staff came and took our drinks order. Seemed quite know as he wrote down the order but then wasn't sure what he had written on his pad when he went over our drinks with us. We order quite a few items off the menu, Yeyes kari, the banana leaf fish, sweet potato leaves etc. when one of our dishes, a salsa like dish which you spoon into pastry like cups, we found a hair in it! Flagged down a member of staff, with some effort despite waving our hand and shouting "excuse me", who took it away and asked of we would like another one. No real apology or anything, the only reassurance we got was that chef checked three times on the knew one. We got our drinks and food which I will say was very tasty and looked fresh. The table then wanted some water so asked a member of staff who brought over a bottle and just planted on the table. Didn't even offer to pour it. We noticed that the table next to us also had to keep flagging members of staff down too. Overall, food is really interesting and tasty. Service could do with a little more work especially when you automatically pay 10% service charge

Set inside the Dorsett Residences just outside of Chinatown, Candlenut has a nice location and a contemporary ambience.I'd like to begin by suggesting that I'm not prone to hyperbole or drama. I don't look for a problem and generally am fine with minor errors and grievances during my dining experiences. Our family of five just finished eating at Candlenut. The food was actually quite good - we tried a variety of the curries. The Tumeric Chicken Wings were also great. That said, we suffered the worst service I've ever experienced in a lifetime of eating meals at great restaurants all around the world. To the point where I became personally offended at the treatment and we finally got up and left.Recommended by the concierge at the Ritz-Carlton where we are staying - they will surely hear our experiences so they don't send anyone else there in the future.At every turn during the meal, it was our job to flag someone down for service. We waited 20 minutes before being acknowledged, and only then did the woman ask if we've ordered yet. We said no - we haven't seen anyone could place a drink order. Another 15 minutes would go by before we could flag down a different person who then would take our lunch order. We tried seven or eight dishes. When we needed more sparkling water due to the heat of the food, we had to flag someone down. When we needed another glass of wine, we had to flag someone down. We were completely and utterly ignored. There were no apologies. We were inconsequential. The place was not overly busy and staff was standing around talking to each other. Not one time did anyone come check on us to see if we needed anything else. We had to find someone at each turn.Both my wife and I felt like it may have been intentional. We are not locals and perhaps there was an element of discrimination. As I mentioned, I'm not one for hyperbole - but the staff at Candlenut could not have done less. It was offensive and I was embarrassed in front of our kids.I finally walked to the front desk and paid the bill, letting the woman know that the service was not only bad, but we felt that whatever was going on was intentional. She said it wasn't and they had new staff. We were the last table left in the restaurant for the final 40 minutes of our meal and still couldn't get any service. Too bad. The food was good. If you are not a local, I wouldn't take a chance of visiting Candlenut

A quiet café on the ground floor of centrally located Dorset Hotel in Chinatown. Authentic Peranakan cuisine - spicy and fragrant! Babi pongteh, chap chye/mixed vegetables, ngoh hiang, beef cheek, rendang - all recommended. But the most memorable is the buah keluak ice cream. As a true blue Peranakan, I've never had buah keluak done this way and was a sceptic. However this creation is amazing - Every spoonful was a burst of joy - MUST TRY!
5
After a failed attempt to book a table at another Peranakan restaurant (it was full) our concierge suggested this new dining spot. We were delighted by the menu and found it very difficult to narrow our choices down to a few dished to share. Ultimately we decided on satays to start followed by a white chicken curry, spicy squid & mushrooms with crispy shallots.The food was nothing short of amazing, we inhaled it! I finished the meal off by trying the durian soup dessert (how could I resist?) and let's just say it is an acquired taste but well worth the experience.I would definitely return to this restaurant time and time again to sample everything on the menu
5
We tried this restaurant having viewed it on TripAdvsor and weren't disappointed.We had read about Peranakan food which is a fusion of Malaysian/Chinese and were interested to try it. To begin with we had decided to try the Pork Belly satay, this was absolutely delicious and surprisingly not at all fatty and spicy turmeric chicken wings. I then had the yellow crab curry which was wonderfully spicy and had the added bonus of being just the crabmeat (no shell). My husband had the Wagyu beef peranakan signature dish made with the filling of black nuts making the sauce thick and black. The beef was melt in the mouth but the sauce tasted strangely of chocolate! It was a very reasonably priced meal at around £50 which included drinks. Would like to go back and try some of the other dishes, but would probably avoid the chocolate beef

When planning our recent trip to Singapore, Candlenut was the stand out restaurant choice for us. It is an example of why we travel - new cultures & foods, that we don’t get to experience back home.We even visited the Peranakan Museum before visiting the restaurant to find out what this was all about !We found the food to be very interesting indeed. As the prices were surprisingly modest we ordered two appetisers, two mains, a couple of vegetable dishes and two desserts.The less interesting dishes for us, though perfectly pleasant,were the Satay and the Chicken Red Curry. They were well cooked and tasty but the tastes were quite familiar to us.The real stand out dishes were the Yellow Crab Curry, which was absolutely delicious and different, and the Buah Keluak dessert, which was really good, unlike any dessert we have ever experienced.I get the feeling that wine isn’t a big deal here. A very short wine list and the white wine was barely chilled. The service could perhaps have been a little sharper, but one could forgive this as the young staff were charming and genuinely knowledgeable and passionate about the products. Overall a very nice experience
5
This was a highlight of our Singapore stay, which was based all around eating ! After a couple of mediocre dinners in Singapore that were ok but expensive for the quality, this was an outstanding value and quality. Every dish we had was superb with great authentic flavor and beautiful presentation. Service was good and a few interesting local beers to try also. Wine list was reasonable too.. All up, we found the flavours, pricing and service of this restaurant to be better than others we tried that we're twice the price and less enjoyable.
5
This is the culinary experience I was looking for. Top notch Asian cooking and at reasonable prices. Dinner for two was $100. Service, setting and decor impeccable. Good stuff.
3
Staff paid no attention to us. It's a small place and I couldn't even catch anyone's eye. Limited menu, food was good but not remarkable. We had only two nights in Singapore and I am sorry I wasted one of them here.
4
For Perananka (something different and unique to this region - the cuisine of when Chinese people came to SE Asia and encountered the spices and flavours here) this was a great experience and I'd definitely return. We usually go to Blue Ginger but lately the reviews have not been great so I thought I'd give this a try.The food was nicely prepared and felt like it was made to order. Dishes came out nice and hot and they were a good size, especially the prawns. Flavours were nice, sour, spicy - just all around different which is what we were looking for. Service was really nice and attentive. Only complaint is that the restaurant needs some soft furnishings - feels a little bit like a hotel breakfast room. Other than that, it's a great restaurant wish some good food and a nice selection of drinks as well. I'll definitely come back. Good value as well

Candlenut is directly opposite the enance to the Dorsett hotel in Chinatown and on top of Outram place MRT station. The decor is plain and simple, giving it an air of a dining hall. The herbs and spices are very fresh - and there are a lot of spices! The food was well presented and when one dish - the petai prawns - was too hot for one of our party, they provided a replacement dish ( crab curry) free of charge - nice touch. The assam fish dish was nicely cooked and the banana pudding - a very light sponge, small caremalised banana and ice cream shared between two - a nice finish. Worth a visit if you are in the area, but the food is spicy. One tip - try and get the more experienced waitress- the younger ones are pleasant but do not know the menu
5
We were interested to try Candlenut, as we had not known of Peranakan cuisine prior to our visit to Singapore. Every dish was a different flavor profile, beautiful to look at, and absolutely delicious. The restaurant looks casual, but the food is not. It is just wonderful.
5
Super wary of fake TA reviews, so I read through quite a few to find a good meal for our last night in Singapore... Truly this did not disappoint. The crab curry was particularly nice; the ladies fingers were the best I've ever tasted and you can tell a lot about a restaurant by the fresh vegetables it serves/ crunchy, not slimy as badly cooked (okra) can be; just perfect.My heart sank when I saw that it was in a new complex.. But then I didn't find any in-betweens here: either a bit shabby or a bit chic!I would describe the service time as 'expected'. The food was freshly cooked, so the prep time had to happen. It was not busy at all. Service staff were very friendly and patiently answered questions and made suggestions.I struggle to find anything wrong, and I'll definitely be recommending it to friends
5
Had three nights in Singapore and having had indifferent and expensive food for 2 nights it was a joy to visit Candlenut. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the Peranakan food was as good as we experienced in Malaysia. Fresh tasty and very well presented in a modern restaurant. 3 course meal for 2 with drinks and service charge 110 sing dollars. An absolute bargain compared to previous evenings
5
Halfway through our meal, I said to my husband, "this is the sort of food that makes me so happy." He laughed but he understood! The meal was simple but the flavours were divine. The duck rendang was amazing, like no other rendang I have ever tried. The crab curry was so intensely but smoothly flavoured, it was a revelation because I normally find that seafood is lost with spicy flavours. Not this baby!We booked and there was no wait for our table. The service was slightly faltering but still very cheerful. The wine list was good and we were able to choose a nice light pinot that matched the food well. Honestly, I could not fault it and we would have gone back again but it was our final night in Singapore. Tell your cab driver "Dorsett Residences" and they will find it easily, it's literally across the laneway. Close to Chinatown if you want to have an after dinner meander too

We were walking around the Bukit Pasoh area looking for a place to grab a quick, low key dinner. Walked past this one, checked out the menu and decided to give it a try. It didn't disappoint!We shared chicken satay (4 sticks for 12sgd), Chap chye, duck rendang (24sgd), and chendol. They serve rice with the dishes in a small bowl (which you can ask to top up). Portions-wise, good for two. The satay was great, especially the peanut - pineapple sauce that went with it. Chap chye was tasty. The duck sat atop a layer of flavorful and spicy (just right, not too overboard) rendang and sprinkled with saffron. The chendol wasn't at all what we expected. No shaved ice here -- more like a coconut custard with gula melaka. Really good.
5
This small restaurant serves an interesting variety of local dishes in a modern setting with a friendly, accommodation wait-staff. We dropped in a bit late for dinner, attracted by the menu's focus on Peranakan food. We split a lovely salad with winged beans and followed that with duck rendang and prawns with noodles. Both had full, but not overpowering spices. We did get overwhelmed by a side order of ladyfingers, that turned out to be sautÃ©ed chilies. The wine list was very presentable and reasonably priced. Service was quite prompt, even though there was a large party of business people in the spot

This restaurant came up via TripAdvisor and I'm very glad we took the recommendations on the site. We walked there from our hotel in Clarke Quay and, whilst a bit of a way away, it was helpful in getting a bit of orientation of the city.The food was gorgeous and I would especially recommend the yellow crab curry, wing bean salad, and mixed satay. the staff were lovely and very helpful with explaining the menu and making suggestions. Food was beautifully presented and it was a wonderful combination of flavours.We even indulged in a dessert and the banana sponge/crumble combo with caramel ice cream was delicious.If you visit this restaurant you won't be disappointed

We used the Trip Advisor app to find this restaurant, please not that the app and map show the OLD location, not the CURRENT location. Hopefully this will be fixed.The address listed in the text is correct.The address, 331 New Bridge Rd, part of the Dorsett Hotel. It's about a 5 minute walk north from the trip advisor map location, or just look for the Dorsett Hotel.The food was delicious and really flavourful. Everything we ordered was great :

Candlenut is so delicious that I'm drooling just thinking about it. My husband and I went there on our last night in Singapore. I wish we had gone earlier because I would have for sure gone back. The dishes are all amazingly flavored, spicy but delicious. We shared several items including bean salad, chicken, lamb, vegetables, and crab curry. Each dish was unique and has distinct textures and flavors. I would love to try everything on their menu. The portions are not too big, so sharing 3-4 dishes for two people is doable. We were loving the food so much so we ended up ordering more food and had a total of 5 items, it was a lot of food, but totally worth it. The restaurant is pretty small and packed. I definitely recommend making a reservation
4
A friend took us here and I like their food, it gives you a feeling of home cooked meals. The sambal Kongkong is very nice, also the fish and the blackened chicken. Their dessert of banana caramel was perfectly done and the coconut were super yummy and sweet. Service is okay, it's full house when we dined in
4
Dined with 7 others here New Years Ever. Cost $302 SG and worth every penny. Best idea is to share these delicate and tasty dishes. Chicken satay starters best I have ever tasted. A bit disappointed in the pork belly but all other dishes supreme. This food represents a cultural delight of traditional food nicely treated with a touch of fusion while retaining Grandma's best flavours.Staff very friendly, helpful and professional. The Candlenut is adjacent to the MRT and easy to find just next to the Dorsett hotel
5
We really enjoyed our meal at Candlenut Kitchen. The staff showed obvious pride in the food served. We had trouble choosing from the menu, and I could, quite happily, have eaten any one of the dishes. We started with soups which were pleasingly flavourful. We then enjoyed pork and chicken mains, each quite unique, visually pleasing and deliciously well-balanced. Attached to the Dorsett Hotel, this restaurant offered a modern, air-conditioned, though somewhat bland interior. We will definitely make a return visit, when next in Singapore

Based on reviews here, I elected to take a group of American and Australian colleagues for dinner for some authentic local food. (I simply despise overblown places like Ku de Ta or Cut, always preferring the art of a local restaurant operator).And indeed, the food is remarkable. Beautiful presentations, deliciously fresh ingredients, and a wide variety of options. Nothing was off, nothing over-done or under-done. The curries were sweet and savory, creamy without being heavy, the shrimp was cooked perfectly, and the lamb shank was amazing. A good selection of fun micro-brewed beers and ciders, along with some wine selections (no cocktails).Unfortunately the ambience negated what should have been a flawless dinner. I'm hoping that this was an isolated incident and not typical of every night, but we started dinner at about 8 pm and the lighting was so bright that it felt as though we were eating in a Walmart or hospital operating room. I found this strange because the food obviously represents a great deal of attention to detail - how they don't understand the importance of ambient lighting escapes me.I definitely plan to return, but it will be with a different expectation with regard to the experience. The food is phenomenal, but don't expect a either a romantic experience or one worthy of impressing business colleagues. - 1 star for the horrible lighting
5
What a phenomenal experience. The restaurant is modern, bright and casual. Finally a delicious restaurant in Singapore that understands it is in fact a restaurant in Singapore, and therefore is in the middle of the tropics and welcomes people dressed however they feel comfortable. The food was delicious. The service was so genuine and attentive. The prices were extremely reasonable. Everything was spot on
5
Besides the wonderful nonya food which has already been reviewed as the best, the service was excellent making it difficult to determine if they were family members who owned the restaurant. They were passionate about literally every dish on the menu. To sum up ....a great dining experience which I hope will be consistent including being reasonably priced
5
I had dinner here with friends - four of us. Peranakan people would never admit that anyone else's food was better than the stuff they get at home. So all four of us agreed that this place served food almost as good. That is very high praise!!The food was excellent - there is no other word to describe it. Go try it for yourselves!!
5
Great food. Great service. The food is done in a way that is both suitable for local and foreigners. Is a place for all occasions.
5
We had an excellent dinner with delicious peranakan dishes and ate to our heart's contend, we would like go back again. Service was great
5
Highly recommend the Yeye's chicken curry. The crispy pork belly is good too. Attentive staff. The restaurant itself is a bit sterile, but the food makes up for it.
4
Excellent welcome and service. Modern interior perhaps a little bland. Service efficient but not pushy and help was given to choose. Menu was small but all of it was tempting! We shared 2 starters, 2 mains, 3 desserts (couldn't choose!) and had 3 drinks and the bill was $130 which we thought was very good value compared to the street food we had in China Town the night before!! The food itself was excellent and well worth a short walk out of the main china town area

I'm Peranakan and learnt how to cook from my Grandma. So I normally find something wrong with every peranakan restaurant I've ever been to. BUT! I love love LOVE the food here! Candlenut's menu is limited but almost everything on it is fabulous. It's not for the stodgy old-fashioned traditionalist, but if you're into great tasting food that makes more than a nod to tradition, go for this! The roast pork crackling is out of this world good. It is juicy, crispy and aromatic all at the same time. The pickled mustard leaves and chincalok that go with the dish is how my grandma taught me to serve it, and you won't find it in any other peranakan restaurant.The beef ribs in buah keluak sauce is another of those almost traditional dishes that you must try. For the true blue peranakan, it's an eye opener. For those who have never tried buah keluak, think of it as eating beef ribs braised in a nutty, almost dark chocolatey sauce. And if you're a dessert person, you MUST do what we did - we ordered one of every dessert on the menu! Sounds decadent? Sorry. It's only about 4 items. But each is done wonderfully, especially the buah keluak ice cream with chocolate sauce and chilli flakes. Unusual, and totally in-your-face.I just hope that the next time I go, I would still be able to get a table
5
I am Korean and I don't really know about Peranakan. My friend recommended me this place and I have to say this place is considered as one of the best authentic food i have ever tasted in Singapore! Spices and food taste amazing. You must try Roasted pork, squid ink dish, and beef with blacksauce..Service is great and food comes out really fast as well. Please make a reservation if you are going on the weekends
5
This restaurant presented a side of Peranaken food that I had never seen before. The kitchen used wonderful fresh ingredients and the servers were wonderful about explaining all the different ingredients, so helpful. Honestly, one of the best dinners I've had in a while. Cannot recommend this place highly enough
5
My friend visiting from the US wanted to try true Peranakan food and I was really stumped.I didn't want high-end prices but wanted really good food,attentive service and a quiet evening to chat...a friend in the industry suggested CANDLENUT. I immediately called for a reservation that night and there was a table available.But buy the time we left it was busy.The food was amazing...flavorful and beautifully presented.We had 2 appetizers,2 main courses and 2 desserts.Each one was unique and yummy ...and you get unlimited rice! The setting is contemporary and spacious...and I will be going back with my hubby next week!I recommend everything we had...starters (called sides) Kueh Pie Tee and Wing Bean Salad.Meat Course was Mum's curry and Seafood course was Sambal Buah Keluak Prawns.Dessert was fabulous ...Buah Keluak ice cream with choc sauce(sounds weird but is amazing...spicy but sweet) and Banana Caramel Pudding.All these courses were outstanding...only open 2-3 months ago...this will catch on very soon! Sharyn,the GM was wonderful and helpful

Finding a decent Peranakan meal in Singapore is getting tougher and tougher. Candlelnut offers a small but satisfying menu. The Crispy Pork Belly was done just right and the portion was quite good. The chicken curry was good, fragrant but not chilly chilly hot. I liked the ngoh hiang - well balanced with the five ingredients as the name implied. But the most impressive is the services - good, homely and friendly - a rare find in Singapore

Candlenut Kitchen just reopened June this year after moving from its Neil Road outlet. Compared to the previous venue, the new venue is more spacious and its separated into two areas. There is a more open area suitable for large group dining and a more cosy and quiet corner for more private dining.The food is home-style Peranakan but with a modern approach. I enjoy their Mum's Curry a lot as it was balanced, flavorful and fragrant. If you prefer something more peppery then their Yeye's Curry is recommended.I was more impressed by their Banana Caramel Pudding (9.00++ SGD) served with homemade Gula Melaka Ice Cream which comes with steamed banana cake and a scoop of gula melaka ice cream and caramelized banana as well as crumble.Price wise it was rather reasonable too, The curries cost about 14.00++SGD each and comes with free flow rice
