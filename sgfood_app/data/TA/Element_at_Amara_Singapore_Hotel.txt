Visited Element @ Amara on a Saturday afternoon and was surprised to see there wasn't much of a crowd. Spread of food was decent. Very cosy settings, friendly and accommodating staffs. Shout out to Wan Ting for her commendable service!

Booking through Chope saved 10% which was great.
Food was decent, not absolutely fantastic but they are generous with their portions.
Could do better with more varieties, but can't complain at that price point. One of the better brunch buffets out there.
3
Good choice of local food however the prawn dumpling is not fresh and the sushi rice is not sticky. I spotted 2 flies in the restuarant. The service is good and the ambience is nice.
5
First time visit the restaurant and has a positive feedback on overall. From front line service and all the way to the food was excellent. Keep up and maintain the same standard on my next visit. Thanks chope for the discount as well

Was so impressed by the staff and spread at Elements during xmas eve dinner that we booked way in advance for buffet for CNY Reunion Dinner . Gave feedback to Manager Mr Thana requesting for chicken satay to be included for CNY dinner Menu as our family cant take beef /lamb , was really impressed that he actually took action and chicken satay was served that night ! There was no time limit on the Buffet dinner unlike other places and we could enjoy our dinner without being rushed. Food was delicious and always promptly replenished . Kudos to all the friendly and polite staff especially Mr Thana for making our XmasEve and CNY Reunion dinner so enjoyable!We will be back for sure.

Was over at Elements for Reunion Dinner on 15 Feb 2018 and I must say that the service was over the top and the food variety was a huge spread, not to mention tasty and of high quality! The Alaskan Crab was succulent --- fresh, sweet, fleshy and juicy and the chempelek dessert in various form --- creme brulee, swiss roll, agar agar etc was a treat! My parents were so pleased with the service and food that they said will come again next year! Thank you Element for giving us such a fuss-free and memorable Chinese New Year Reunion dinner! :)

Came here for hi-tea and I must say it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s one of the best for the price you pay.Laksa is amazingly fragrant. Satay (only beef and mutton) with peanut sauce is tasty. Chicken rice is good too. A wide varieties of food for you to choose from.
5
We sat outside to have a drink and ended up eating the happy hour pizza, which was good. My wife, as always, ordered a Cosmopolitan. Over the years and around the world, this order has frequently produced some comical results, if one is even available. Not here. She declared it the best Cosmo she's had anywhere. Outside tables, good service, good draft beer, Cosmo and pizza all add up to a five star for this place
4
With a good variety of cuisine and elegantly presented, the buffet at Element is an ideal business and leisure venue. Service is outstanding, nothing is too much to ask for, a special shout out for the manager, Rav, he is so friendly and attentive, and his service team all exudes the same warmth. We will definitely be back
1
Limited food variety, food replenishment extremely slow, unfriendly staff & coffee machine not working.
Not worth going !!!
5
Amara location is good. Today was my first time to Element. Buffet lunch is delicious,especially their Janpanese Sushi and desserts. Chempadak cake is super nice. Nice hotel and nice restaurant.üòò

Been to Element couple of times for lunch and dinner. Was always satisfied and happy after each meal. Great Food and a good mix of selection. Enjoyed every section and ending each meal with fantastic desserts! Ma Ma Mia!!! Definitely going back again.

This is almost crazy. Only option for vegetarians are fruits. Absolutely insensitive to vegetarian needs.
4
There were many varieties of food offered here and the staff were very friendly. One even introduced me to new food to try and it was delicious. However, the restaurant can be quite hot at times.
5
15 of us family and friends attended. The service staff were well trained. The Restaurant Manager Mr Ravanan set up a cosy and relaxing sitting area for us. All my guests were v pleased for his excellent service and professionalism. No efforts were spared in attending to our requests. He definitely did a great job to ensure all my guests had an enjoyable evening. The buffet spread was v good and of high quality like the cod fish, roast beef , duck and lobster. The live band was entertaining and there was even a lucky draw. My guests suggested to go back again for the coming Chinese New Year festive celebration
5
We had our dinner at the element at Amara on 25 dec 2017 and we are impressed by the excellent customer service especially the assistant manager , Sharon as she had put in extra effort to ensure that our sitting arrangement near the food serving area as my parents having difficulty in walking . I will certainly recommend my friends this place .
4
There is a good range of seafood for the buffet dinner. Sharon the restaurant Manager was very friendly and personable and kept checking on her customers. And Joanne the service staff was another very attentive and helpful staff. Overall we were very impressed with the service provided
4
came across Element @ Amara Singapore as the hotel having the longest lunch buffet at a affordable price of SGD39++ .... where one can enjoy Singapore local food and complimented by some western and Japanese .. the table settings are comfortable and spacious, it's a great place for gathering with friends and family .
3
We reserved the table through chope, and it indicated 15% discount for the dinner buffet, however we are told by the restaurant staff it is limit to 10%. We don't feel comfortable and hope that Chope should reflect the true discount so as not to mislead the customers
4
Friendly and wonderful staffs. Thank you for the surprise birthday cake for my Sister, it was really good! The kids enjoyed our childhood drink at the nostalgia setting section. We had a great family gathering.
4
the breakfast options are so wide that keeps you running for the whole day. Watch out for Hipster event for a free flow drinks and food
4
Enjoyed most of the selections. Staff is very warm, friendly and helpful especially Mei Ling who has made us felt so comfortable the moment we walked into the restaurant. Great service. Ambience is great.
5
We ate here for two days and were remembered by Joanne, who immediately brought us our preferred beverages and the egg chef made excellent omelettes to order. A great buffet breakfast
5
Wide variety of different food in a nice ambient. Very nice and kind staff. One of our favorite places in Singapore to go for lunch/dinner.

Yay!!It's back! We were so sad when the hotel Mgmt decided to do away with its buffets a few months ago. We love the food, the cozy ambience and it's warm and friendly servers, Chef and manageress The Chinese sausage wax rice is a fav of mine. It really hits that "grandma's" signature dish. The texture and the frangnace. My little gal loves their soba. And Chef always has one ready for her. Even if it's not on the menu, Chef or Wanting will make sure she still gets it. You can totally feel the loveÔºÅTo finish off, have the Chempadak Creme bulee. Not one, not two but three and end it with a weak cup of tea. Best ever! (TQ wanting for this)A special shout out for Wanting, Sharon and Chef Jamil - thanks for looking out for us
5
Shout out to Sharon the filipina manager or supervisor not sure but she is really very nice to us and really gave us excellent service! Pls give her a good commendation as she was really the nicest staff who served us during our lunch buffet. They also prepared sliced of cake and sing a bday song to my friends! Thank u so much Amara Hotel Element Restaurant
3
Made via chope 2 hours prior and the restaurant wasn't aware of our reservations when my guest arrived, commenting that it was full. Only upon my arrival, that I showed the chope reservation did they quickly arrange a seat. Got a SMALL round table which in my opinion is too squeezy for 3 pax. Limited variety n quality doesn't feels worth the $50 lunch price. Crayfish is way too dry n tough. waitress attitude is still good despite the crowd except that I have to bring the used Plate to them instead of them initiating to clear.
5
Loving the welcoming Atmostphere of the Restaurant.Meet and greeted by the delightful Host Ms. Sharon Maullion and The Chef of The Hause Mr.Carmelo Carnevale .We did have an easy arrival in the Hotel But because of them They made our stay Enjoyable. Thank you,Schumachers

My wife and i were pretty impress by impression of the interior as it is sleek in design and very clean. The service is very attentive and they are very polite. As for the food we have delightful selection of food. We had a great evening
4
This restaurant situated a the Amara Hotel is an attractive option with an extensive buffet including beautiful seafood and perfectly-cooked beef. An attraction for us was an off for the Second Diner of 50% off ..
4
Dropped by here and was just looking for a quick and uncomplicated meal before going to the airport. I FOUND IT. The minihamburgers were simply delicious! I normally stay in a hotel just across the street and going forward I will for sure come back and have the burgers
1
Went tonight with 8 of my friends to celebrate birthday, OMG! Not worth a single penny at all. Limited food selection, tasteless and very slow in topping up. Crayfish, lobster, sushi and roaster turkey, all so dry. Even the cakes are so dry. Drinking soup like drink plain water. Even their toilet is so dirty
5
Celebrated my sister in law's birthday on a weekday evening. First, we really enjoyed the seafood, but most of all, the service staff were absolutely delightful, helpful and prompt. Staff joanne even came round to offer us hot tea because she noticed that we were all very full from dinner and told us it'll help with digestion. They chatted with us and made us feel very welcomed. Thank you for the birthday surprise and all of us had a great evening
5
Had dinner at Element and was greeted with the best service staff and delightful selection of food. The manager sharon was so so so nice, and also the wait staff that helped us at our table. I would definitely come back again as the food and ambience is really good
5
Today went to Element for birthday celebration. The seafood was fresh and service was excellent. What make it awesome was the staff, Wan Ting who was very warm & helpful to recommend their signature dishes like creme brulee Cempedek etc. She was very attentive to detail and make my birthday a memorable one.
4
We were staying at the Amara so wanted a simple mean in-house. This wasn't quite what we expected. Nice ambience and comfortable environment. Very attentive staff - but a little too much so and as a result we ended up with things we didn't really want.The food wasn't what we expected from the hotel dining book - dim sum, salads Asian soups, bread, Raman, hot Japanese style foods and masses and masses of cold seafood. Great if you like Asian food and seafood but we're not keen enough on either to have chosen this restaurant if we had known. Deserts are impeccable though. The in-house ice-cream was particularly good.Not a great place for you if you aren't a meat eater.We have no idea how the bill ended up so expensive
5
I visited the Amara Hotel for lunch a couple of weeks ago. The buffet had a variety of selected cuisines. My favorite was the beef rendang and truffle mashed potatoes. The best part is, the price was extremely reasonable and affordable. I would definitely go again with friends, the atmosphere is semi casual, very amiable and appropriate for friendly gatherings and casual social events.

I'm very disappointed and in fact, annoyed with this restaurant. I came on a Sunday evening for a 1-for-1 Fave / Groupon buffet deal with free flow drinks. That was S$115, and was on a 25% discount already. Still rather expensive, but I wanted to give Elements a shot.Their menu indicates that oysters are available on a daily basis, and before even purchasing the Fave / Groupon, I personally called to check and confirm with them that oysters will definitely be available every day for dinner. When I walked past the seafood section, I smelt something rather fishy. And I don't mean fresh seafood sort of fishy, but rather, stale, un-fresh seafood sort of fishy. It was just a wiff, so I tried to ignore it. However, it was quite evident that the seafood was not fresh at all. The lobster, crayfish and spanner crab were all very dry and their meat had no taste and it was like chewing a mouthful of rubber. The lobster claws tasted like they had been soaking in brine for far too long. The worst part was there were no oysters at all on the ice bed. I had to ASK for oysters, and only then did the man behind the counter reluctantly FISH THE SHUCKED OYSTERS OUT OF A BUCKET OF WATER. It was disgusting. It was obvious that the oysters had been frozen. They did not taste fresh either, and were all very small. The man put less than a dozen oysters on the bed of ice and stopped. They were all gone the moment he took them out as there were other anxious diners obviously waiting to swoop in on the oysters.When I returned for more, I specifically asked for half a dozen. The man feigned ignorance and said "1 or 2?" Most absurd and completely unacceptable. I repeated myself and said I would like half a dozen. He gave a contemptuous laugh and said "So many?" then proceeded to fish only 4 oysters out of the bucket. I asked if he knew that half a dozen meant 6 oysters, and he sneered at me and said that there were no more oysters. A chef manning the salad counter approached and explained that they had run out of oysters because it was a Sunday night and that the suppliers still had not come in with oysters. The chef also claimed that they did not serve frozen oysters, only fresh ones, hence there were no more oysters. This was at 8:15PM on a Sunday night. When I told him that I had specifically checked the menu and had in fact confirmed that there would be oysters on a daily basis and specifically on Sunday, and that the restaurant was wrong to misrepresent such information, the chef kept insisting that the suppliers did not come in and that they had replaced oysters with lobsters instead. However, lobsters were already on the menu, so the oysters were basically not replaced with anything.The free flow drinks turned out to be a choice of coke or sprite. Both of them were completely watered down and tasted worse than water. The server for our table kept removing our serviettes when we had barely used them. And she did not replace them until we asked her to do so. How are diners supposed to eat without serviettes, especially if you keep taking them away? And if she thinks this is supposed to "save" paper, it does not. I had to ask her thrice to bring serviettes because every time I got up to get more food my barely touched serviette would have been removed and there was no replacement.The salad bar was almost non-existent. There was a bowl of spinach leaves, a bowl of mixed salad leaves and one bowl of what appeared to be red lettuce (it was unnamed). There was a miserable looking bowl of corn which had been out for so long that it was oozing water, and some pickled onions. I don't recall seeing any other toppings memorable enough to mention. For dim sum there was only a bun, har gao and siew mai. There was duck wrapped in crepe, but the crepe was thick and chewy and the piece of duck wrapped inside was almost non-existent.There was a selection of about 6 or 7 hot foods, but none were particularly memorable nor tasted fantastic. It was all rather mediocre and bland.Sashimi was okay. It was not the freshest, but thankfully it had not gone bad either. What annoyed me was that the chef behind the sashimi counter could not even bother slicing the sashimi properly. They were all still stuck together at the base. Either the chef is lazy, or the knife is not sharp enough (which basically means that the chef is still lazy, since he can't be bothered to keep his tools of trade up to standard).I won't come back here again. Service was dismal and the food was even worse. I've eaten at other buffets at lesser establishments and gotten stellar service and a larger selection and far, far better quality of food. I'm disappointed that Amara hotel should house such a lacklustre restaurant in its lobby.I'd also warn others against considering Elements as a buffet place. I cannot vouch for its other food, but I would give this place all the thumbs down for buffet. Not recommended at all

I went there for their buffet lunch with my hubby for his birthday today... made a hassle-free reservation just yesterday via email and received a prompt confirmation via email... Best of all, the Manager, Ravana took the initiative to prepare a small birthday cake for my hubby... He even agreed to give my Husband a complimentary parking ticket that is only meant for hotel guest since it is his birthday... That really pleased us to have chosen the restaurant. The food are good and we had a good feast. I would also like to compliment the serving staffs as they are really alert and see to our needs promptly. My glasses are never empty before they get refilled. Thanks to Joanne who looks really passionate with her job... kudos to that! End of our meal, Ravana came to our table with the serving staffs and a piece of cake, singing a birthday song for my Husband... I can see that it pleasantly surprises him... the staffs then took turns to shake hands with my husband and wish him happy birthday... thanks team for the great effort and the personal touch... What more can you ask for when dining... P.S. We ate the yummy cake before taking the pic... hahaha..

Came here for a few drinks after work last night. Beers were good, food fairly average. Ordered a pizza but it never turned up. Some of the guys were complaining about warm beers, but mine were ok. Atmosphere is a bit lacking.
5
Great place to dine. Had breakfast are every day! Chef Murthy was great! He made special meals on request.
4
I'm returning back to Amara after almost ten years.
The menu, staff and layout seems refreshed.
And they have managed not to out price themselves in the interim.
3
If you are looking for a place to unwind after a tough grind at the office, Element may be a good option for you. During happy hour, a pint of beer can be as low as S$10. They got a wide selection of beer, wine, spirits.Plus an equally interesting food menu. During our first visit, it was purely drinks - beer, red and white wine, non alcoholic beverages. I recommend Peroni beer, Bortoli Red and Lychee Tea. Food will be on a different day. Place is relaxing, and service is quick and attentive. This deserves a return.
2
I visited this restaurant with three others as we were hoping for some yummy Tapas. We had to wait awhile for someone to take our drink order, and then they got the order wrong. We ordered a bunch of what they called tapas, but we were all very disappointed. There were no olives, olive oil, or typical tapas food. Instead we were given heavily breaded and fried chicken wings & calamari, a tiny portion of super thinly sliced cheese served with Ritz (!) crackers, the paella leaved a lot to be desired, and the sizzling garlic shrimp were quite tasteless. Super disappointed - we will not go back and cannot recommend this place
3
For some reason, even though they have "sangria" in neon lights outside, they did not have sangria on the drinks menu. Anyway, they mixed up a glass for me, which I found to be a bit too bitter. We ordered mini burgers, grilled octopus and meatballs, all of which were okay, but not worth going back for, in my opinion. For the price (around SGD15-20 each), I could have gotten better food somewhere else. Maybe they have better value for money for their local cuisine...
3
Came here for the ala carte lunch set. Many folks come for the buffet instead, so make sure you let the associates know. Modernist layout and a shared indoor seating with alfresco option too. Quieter and attentive service - probably because it was a weekday.Food quality is alright for taste. Cannot say to be outstanding. Best value is indeed still the lunch set though choices are limited
3
I cannot say anything bad about this experience but I wouldn't suggest to go there as I think there are other places in the city that offer more tasty food. We went there for a dinner with groupon coupon and I think it was overpriced. Food was fine but we didn√Ç¬¥t enjoy it as we expected
3
Visited during one of the weekend with my family. This is third time visiting this restaurant by using Groupon. I had very good experience with this restaurant and like it so much that it is my first option for buffet. However, this visit was disappointing.First of all, kids less than 5 dine for free. My kids like their fried pork cutlets and chocolate tarts. They also enjoy the breadstick. Fried rice is suitable for kids too. Seafood is the most disappointing section. They serve cray fish and one of the crab (red in colour, but not sure the name). No Alaska crab, no lobster like my previous visit. The cray fish is tough or rubberly, and I cannot taste the sweetness from the other crab too. The top up is slow, but it does not bother me because of the poor seafood selection. They offer 2 types of sashimi, tuna and salmon. Freshness is good and standard is maintained. They also serve tempura prawn, which is one of the better dish. Sushi selection is good, but not appetising.The cooked food is limited. The good thing is they serve nice pork cutlet that my kids like. The prawn noodle and Japanese fried rice quite nice too, but not a impressive one.The best dessert is the chocolate tart. Brownie is dry but taste not bad. Others are just average. Overall service staff are prompt and friendly, but food top up is slow.Unlikely I will go back again.
4
I stayed at the Amara Hotel and Element was an option for breakfast each morning. Good variety. Very clean breakfast bar. Made to order omelets. Staff is helpful and service is good. Ate once for Lunch buffet also and that had a very good variety of local cuisine
5
Good selection of food. Alaskan crab, black pepper cray fish is good. Desserts miniature cakes are nice as well. Overall excellent service by staff Hwee San who made us feel so welcomed & was attentive to our needs.
5
From the door welcome to departure all staff were there to help provide an experience of fine cuisine.
A 'piled on the plate' set up is NOT part of this chef's presentation, instead suitable portioned and cooked as asked..
3
Staffs are friendly. Food not bad. Their roti prata are crispy and their vegetable curry for the prata is nice.
5
The food at the Element is great. We just loved the meals. The
staff are so helpful and treat you like long lost friends.
5
Not cheap Buffett but you definitely get your money's worth. Good selection, friendly, efficient and helpful staff.
3
Very basic breakfast offerings with some equipment like a toaster not properly set-up for the breakfast service
3
Sit outside and have a cold beer and watch the world go bye. A nice way to relax and make plans for later in the day.
3
We went for the dinner buffet at Element early Jan 2017.While the spread is as stated per description, a number of its food items were of a quality that one wouldn't consider eating. The oysters resembles a dried up patch on a shell with some ice on it. The tempura was cold and other hot dish selections barely warm. The taste of the food was generally ok, but nothing to write home about, with staples such as rice, potato or vegetable based dishes a bare minimum. The pasta and noodle station, was hardly manned and therefore went untried.While we didn't leave hungry, it won't warrant a repeat, even with a special offer
3
The restaurant Element is in the hotel The Amara @ Tras Street.The buffe at Christmas time was great, delicious and fresh, especially the taste of the fresh turkey was delicious.The lobsters are also very fresh but as a cold dish not so nice. The sashimi at the sushi bar war great but you have to ask for it.The dessert is nice. All in all it was a good buffet for the price range.But: it could be a little more Christmas decoration on the tables especially for table reservations
3
Fresh food: 2/5 - was kinda disappointed by the lobster and crab legs which I felt was abit oversoak in the ice causing it to lose some of the taste of the seafood. Replenishment was kinda slow as well. Cooked food: 4/5 - the cook food was very good like the black pepper crayfish and other cook seafood and beef.Service: 4/5 - compliments to staff Hwee San and Crystal for going out of their way to look out for us such as finding scissors to cut the crab and getting birthday cake for the birthday girl. Overall: 3/5. Would have given this place a 4/5 if the fresh seafood was good. Price: 3/5 was only affordable after getting discount vouchers from other sources.
3
I took buffet dinner here. I was seated promptly. Personnel is curteous. Food choices vary from sea food to spanish inspired meat dishes and sausages. I satisfied my hunger but I can't say I enjoyed the food. Price seem to be appropriate.
3
They have a tastefully done indoor area and an almost alfresco area, where one can sit to have a quiet drink without having to deal with noisy traffic.
5
I love this place so much. It a real makan sutra here... A must try restaurant. The food was really nice and tasty.
5
We were looking for a restaurant that was different in Singapore to the usual Asian style food that abounds in this city. Found Element by accident and glad we did. Service was excellent, food was delicious and the best thing was when the chef came out and chatted to us about the meal he had prepared. Great customer relations right there
5
Came with a colleague for Dinner. Spread was good. Alaskan Crab was tastier then the previous visit. There was Indian Briyani on the menu, and it was fantastic, very well done like those High-Class Indian Biryani house standards and my chinese colleague loved it. The Lobster was big and well-marinated top with salad, and Herbel soup that comes along was heaven. We will be back again. Worth the price and the Captain of the ship, Mr. Nazrin's service was excellent, he took care and managed the entire crew into a wonderful hospitable service
2
After a hard Saturday morning work and then shopping for dinner I felt like my first glass of wine (needed the bathroom after a few beers) and I stopped by Element not far from my apartment. When he came with the glass I thought someone must have been drinking from it (see picture) since it probably was the smallest glass of wine I ever had - and that says a lot!! I did complain and to their benefit they did top up the glass!
2
My issues started off with an incredibly rude person who took my booking which should have been a warning sign. The buffet itself was average with disinterested/ unhelpful staff, unreplenished dishes and not a great deal of choice. the food itself was not of a bad quality but you can get much better buffets in Singapore with far better service. I would not go back here agai
4
This is our second visit to this restaurant. Using a Coupon enabled us to eat 2-1 with our child eating for free.Parking is available in the basement though it was a stinging $8 for the Saturday lunchtime stint. Ouch!I liked the fact we turned up earlier than the 12:00-14:30 timing and we didn't have to wait. We were shown to our reserved table, where there was a child seat already waiting.The food is Western Fayre but has crayfish, sushi, sashimi, Tempora, prawns etc.Main dishes were Mushroom pie, shepherd's pie, meatballs, quasidilla,Desserts were mini cakes, ice cream, tiramisu, tea, coffee and soft drinks. One thing not on offer at the weekend was cheese and biscuits.All the food was nice. We would go back to this buffet as there was no queueing, there were no empty serving pots (ie food was always replenished.) The restaurant not making folk wait until noon was good as it prevented a food frenzy and queues.This is a nice buffet and if you get the coupon makes it good value for money ($75 for two with coupon)
5
Came here on June 12th with a colleague of mine, we totally enjoyed every food that was on the menu. New menu from the last visit and it was exceptional. To name a few, the Alaskan Crap was big fresh and tasty. The century egg was simply perfect! The duck roll was amazing, tasty crunchy and you can eat as non-stop. They also had DIY Rojak, the sushi counter has freshly cut sushi varieties as well. Overall, the service and the all the dishes were excellent. Ramen Mee was fantastico...... A MUST GO place to eat!!!
3
We went on a Sat night for dinner. The restaurant wasn't full, but the food was taking too long to be replenished. Although the seafood was fresh, the food counters were always empty. Not just the food, lemon wedges, cutlery, hot tea etc. It will be good to be there 630pm when the buffet starts. The variety weren't great, but there's sashimi, tempura, cha soba, cold seafood(oysters, alaskan crab, small boston lobster, prawns, mussels, crayfish etc), hot noodles, limited hot dishes, desserts, fruits, 2 types of ice cream...it is best to sit around the food counters, so that you know when the food is finally replenished. Haha.. Oh, there are houseflies in the restaurant!
4
Element Restaurant located in the Amara Hotel, offers excellent buffet spread with Spanish and Local specialties. Great Ala Carte and Good Wine selection as well.
Highly recommend for family outings .
5
It was great, and I ate there for almost two weeks! Never got bored of the extensive selection, all fresh, all diets catered for.
5
We started out checking out a place to chill out every Wednesday and we found this place. We were amazed on how cheap their "Ladies Night" offer for prosecco. The staff are very friendly and accommodating especially Ahmad. Chef Samuel's food is superb. Love it!
5
Visited here during a busy lunch buffet. The restaurant is clouded with families and couples. Food variety is good, with good spread with seafood on ice ( free flow of Alaska crab, spanner crab, cooked prawn, mussel etc), sashimi (salmon, tuna, salmon roe, octopus), cooked food (dim sum, satay, ramen, meat ball) and dessert ( tiramisu, brownie, ice cream). Service is prompt, but not very friendly. Food quality is very high, better than some of the buffet in 5 stars hotel, especially the free flow of Alaska crab during lunch, make this Buffett super worth the price. Highly recommended, especially during promo time with deals/coupons.
5
It gets crowded pretty quickly. I went during lunch but my companions who went during dinner on a weekday said it's less crowded and the seafood spread was basically left to them. The sashimi is cut infront of you and this is the only buffet I've seen where they have tempura prawn. The cooked/hot food was also delicious. Perhaps they can work on their dessert spread and include chocolate fondue or waffle with ice cream

1 of the most unbearable experience I had comparing with other hotels.From the staffs to the food, no words to describe except for the floor manager!?Staffs' services are real bad. Not sure whether are they force to do their work or simply doesn't bother to provide proper services at all. One of the waiters, a young chap really got to perk up his spirits! Seem like he works without a soul!! He even can put plate on top of my plate while I am still holding it for him to clear. Really speechless!1 most important part is the lady who is in charge of the cashier. We bought vouchers for this dinner and when she wanted to see my vouchers, she actually took my handphone to the cashier without even asking for permission!! She just merely asked to see the vouchers which I gladly showed it to her. I really did not expect her next action was to take my HP away from my sight openly to the cashier!! Please at least tell me what you need me to do or tell me at least that you are borrowing my phone to scan the barcode. No word! Really!! This is so embarrassing to have such services!!But I would like to comment the lady floor manager on duty (not sure whether is it her position) to have a better services. At least she gave me a little light at the end of the tunnel. THANK YOU! The food are really average. Some of the food are real salty. Choices of desserts are little. So, if one who come here, please do not have high hopes for their dessert choices. Will I go back again!? Definitely not!! Anyway it will not be any harm for the hotel restaurant to have 1 lesser customer
3
This is a nice little outside bar in Tras street which is ideal for a few drinks to finish the evening with after you've dined at one of the nearby restaurants. Prices aren't too unreasonable by Singapore standards (ends up being around $15 a beer, all in) and service is efficient
3
Food-My relatives felt that the seafood was fresh. I felt that the Oysters were fresh. The beef was tough though. Replenishment of the dessert can be faster. At times, the remaining stuff at the dessert looks very forlorn. Only coffee and tea for drinks though. Service- This place made more of an effort to clear the empty plates than the place that I went to on 1st Jan 2016. They didn't give any faces when we had to order refill of our teas.Price- ReasonableLocation - Less 10 minutes walk from train station. Its not next to it
4
Boring and tired of traditional / classic roast turkey. This year order a Nyonya flavour Turkey and honey glazed bone-in ham. The Nyonya sauce was not too over powering, it blended well with the turkey. Make you want to have more serving. The bone-in ham was superb, my friend who don't really like meat also ask for more serving, it is juicy and the meat for so tender. The food was packed nicely and by the time I delivered to my friend's house, the food was still warm

We enjoy the tapas creation. This the newly open tapas section next to existing buffet.Have the privilege of Chef Samuel who was specially selected and trained in Spain. He was very friendly and warm to explain the different tapas creation such as beef Cheek and smoked duck. We like the squid ink paella rice and angel hair pasta. The 3 different deserts were unique too.Food price was very reasonable
1
Food spread is very bad. Only tea and coffee is included. Not even soft drinks is included.
Service is very average at best and the food does not taste great. Not worth the money at all.
5
Fantastic buffet with enough to satisfy all tastes. Seafood, meats, differing regions are available. Too much to eat as always
3
Had bad oyster. Mostly hidden food. Had to ask after seeing other diners carrying some of the food. Lost my appetite when no one was attending the counters where my favourite food was supposed to be
3
Tried their nasi goreng. It's delicious! Nice ambience too. Good for biz, friends n family. Give it a try if you are nearby.
4
The food at the Amara is exceptionally good for this range of hotel. You could do a lot worse. And the restaurant attracts a lot of local diners, not just hotel guests. Always a good sign.
5
Amazing food! Not much vegetarian options though although the cakes will fill you up. A little bit pricey but value for money.
4
The buffet was ok. Was a little disappointed with the selection. A number of seafood but not many cooked food.
2
Ordered their garlic prawns and tortilla - both were ordinary tasting. Prawns were salty and tortilla (classic spanish dish!) was bland. Quite dissaponting considering kitchen was headed by a one michelin starred chef.Price point is a bit steep for tapas as you usually need to order several dishes to share. Personally would not recommend friends to dine her
5
I went there for lunch during the week. The tapas are some of the bests I've had in Singapore. If you get the lunch set you get more progressive food, but if like me you just love spanish food, you will love the tapas there. The chef came to talk to us and was very friendly. All in all a good experience, I will go there again during an evening to get a second opinion
5
Went there with family & friends using vouchers. Surprisingly good range of food & service. Especially the seafood, wide variety, fresh & well cooked. Other sections were good too in presentation & taste. Love their Chempedak custard dessert. The only complain is I couldn't stick to my resolution to eat less
3
Being there once on deals.com. or groupon promotion. Good variety but okay food only. .not the worst nor the best internation buffet i had eaten in Singapore.
5
One of the best buffet spread in town area. Cosy and comfy seats. Brilliant settings n scenario. Welcoming staffs. Kudos to this international buffet. Affordable too and value for money.
5
Enjoyed the theme buffet during our visit. Service was commendable and the selection of food was great. The selection of desert was amazingly done and I enjoyed the good quality ice cream served.
4
Always worth a dinner, the chicken and rice is one of the best.
Popular with the locals.
Love the surroundings

This is my 2nd visit to Element with my buddy.Staff service is tops especially the Restaurant Staff Sharon. Even though the restaurant was full, the seating area and food spread were well spaced out so you never feel like you are jostling for food like in some other buffet hotels. Spread is good, and quality excellent. Quality control is maintained with food served in sufficient quantities but never running out. They top up fresh food continually. There's a good spread of seafood cold dishes and were fresh. Desserts, cakes and the crab soup and the sambal crap was marvelous and extremely tasty.One of my favorite buffet places in Singapore right now. Will come agai

The element is one of the eight restaurants in the Singapore Amara Hotel that also serves as the breakfast venue for the residing guests. Large, and separated into different sections (with d√©cor to match, for example there is a section with a bar), it offers a range of cuisines; Malay, Japanese, Continental and Chinese. The buffets at lunch and dinner seem to be very popular where a huge selection of dishes covering all the cuisines mentioned), including roasts and seafood are offered. The range of desserts that includes Asian and Continental choices is also impressive. Some items, like the roast and salmon are especially good. Even if some items do not meet that special cut there are plenty of choices to make up for the deficit. Of course, meals may be ordered a la carte, but nobody seemed to bother.The d√©cor and ambiance are such as to cover a broad spectrum of situations, from a Sunday family brunch to a business lunch. The service is good for a restaurant of this size. Both at breakfast and lunch the supervisor stopped over to have a little chat, exchange notes and advise on items that may please. Overall, a good dining experience at both occasions
3
The drinks are reasonably priced. But the prices of the bar food in relation to the size of serving, nearly make me fall of the chair. The serving is too little for me to comment if it is tasty or not. In case you are wondering where is the bar, it is along a public walkway.

We were taken here by some friends who are resident in Singapore on a Sunday evening.The choice of dishes was overwhelming and it was difficult to know what order to eat the dishes as they were all so appealing.We tried most dishes between us and had no dishes that were anything but very tasty.We really enjoyed our visit to the Element restaurant and will visit again when visiting Singapore
5
Had our dinner here and was amazed at how great the service are. All the staff were friendly and attentive. We would like to thank all the staff especially Senan, for taking the time to walk us around each food spread and gave us a brief explanation of the food. We really appreciate it. We had a great time and would love to come back and dine in again. Highly recommended!
5
Honestly, i loved the service.. the food excellent.I cannot thank the service staff for making my dining experience at Element any better. The service staff always took great care of my family as well as the child i brought along. The fact that they even prepared the high chair and baby plates before my arrival was indeed the first point of impressing service. Then they were always attentive on the drinks, food service and any other things.The food was great as well.This place is highly recommended.As a Hospitality staff, they totally killed the "Under Promise, OVER DELIVERY" CONCEPT
2
Good spread of food selections but poor quality and taste. The spider crab doesn't taste fresh, tempura not using the quality Japanese flour. The soya baked cod fish is a bit too salty. Need a lot of improvement..
4
Waitress Minh from Vietnam. In spite of grumpy senior staff she is a gem, remembering drinks that occasional customers had months ago.
That's the kind of attitude and service we badly need in Singapore.
3
An average hotel Resturant serving buffet style meals. All well cooked and presented. Staff could be more friendly, caught one yawning as if bored about the whole thing!
3
We had a snack here last night after having a foot massage. Service was attentive and food we ordered was okay.
4
I had enjoyed the buffet here due to the pricing as well as a good range of seafood. Ranging from oyster, lobster, crayfish, scallops, prawns etc. Cooked food section though spread wasn't that big but was of good quality. Had enjoyed the cod fish, generous serving.Service was good. Had enjoyed my meal
4
I like the Spread and the Service of the Staff. Especially the Coffee!!Thumps Up for that. The Coffee is fresh and with the freshly brewed aroma of the beans. Quite a Open and a lot of Space to accommodate. The Staff are courteous and very prompt.

Was there for the buffet dinner and it was also an occasion to celebrate my mum's birthday.However, it was all spoilt by their grumpy staffs and poor service attitude!! From the moment we step in, the Chinese manager ( i supposed he is as his uniform is diff from the rest ) wasn't at all friendly even though he's the first person to greet us into the restaurant. Shortly after, our encounter with the rest of the service staffs proved to be the same. No smiles, no please, no patience... And certainly wasn't working towards the attitude of providing their patrons with the best dinning experience! The only staff worth mentioning is Rapi who serves with a smile. Even the chefs standing behind the food counter were dissappointing.. Topping up of food was slow and not attentive.i waited for a good 15 mins for the chef to top up the soba noodle but to no avail.. Finally, I went up to him and requested and that's when he realized it is finished! It was a sun night and the restaurant wasn't even running a full house.. I'm sure the service staffs can do much better than that. Food selections weren't that fantastic. The only staple which is Spanish rice was a let down, the Peking duck was not up to standard with hardly any skin inside the crepe, the broccoli soup was bland. Thankfully the chili crab was good and it comes with the Chinese mantou to dip with the sauce. The seafood section was ok with lobster, crab, oyster etc The cake selection was quite limited too. All in all, not worth the money and certainly with the attitude of the service staffs, I will definitely not be back again!

I came here with my husband on Wednesday, 3 September 2014 to celebrate his recent promotion at work. There are two areas where patrons can choose to sit, the inside where the buffet is located and the alfresco area. We did not make a reservation and we arrived at 730PM but the Caucasian manager was very accommodating when we told her we were celebrating a special occasion and gave us a table at the alfresco area. We went for the buffet but we also had some mushroom brochette and Spanish omelette as starters. The brochette was thick and juicy, filled with generous portions of succulent pork meat while the Spanish omelette was filled with potatoes and onions. We enjoyed both dishes and ordered another round of brochettes.Element has a wide spread of buffet items, and has its own sushi counter and pastry table as well as a cooked food table. I really enjoyed the smoked duck and salmon, while my husband was partial to the Spanish rice being served on the buffet as well as the fresh sashimi from the Japanese counter. I enjoyed the sashimi selection as well but the highlight of my dinner was the seafood section. Oysters, prawns, crabs, lobsters.. They were all there and being an avid seafood lover, I was in heaven! The lobsters were especially fresh. The cooked food table was serving lamb and beef and pork. I had both the lamb and beef, it was pretty tasty and well-cooked, My only grievance was that the chef in charge of the cooked food stand should cook more lamb and beef parts and not just a few pieces of meats each time. My husband wanted some beef as well but he had to wait as I had taken the last pieces of beef and the chef had to fry up a new batch. The restaurant has a reasonable good range of wine selections, I can't remember what we had exactly but we had two bottles of it and it was good and not very expensive.Element has a DJ playing at their alfresco bar near the entrance and according to the staff, they have a slew of DJs playing from 6 to 10PM everyday except Sundays. My husband and I hate it when an excellent bar or restaurant ruins its ambiance and credibilty by playing music that is totally unsuitable for its venue - think 'The Cufflink Club' at Jiak Chuan Road, which is a really fantastic bar but it ruins its atmosphere with the cheesy music played from an iPod.The DJ on this particular night was playing a mix of slow house music and disco (I don't know the exact genre) and not the usual commercial rubbish that was playing at the other bars and restaurants beside Element. The music reminded us of Ku De Ta, the roof-top bar at MBS where we had our Sunday lunch. Excellent choice of music selection!The music played was very suited for the atmosphere of the area. It was just at the right volume and it set the tone for our evening. It was complementary to our conversations and was not instrusive at all. We could see other patrons enjoying themselves as well.We went up to him just after 10PM when he ended his set as my husband wanted to thank him for a good job and get his name-card. He was very friendly and was very accommodating because when my husband asked him for the titles of the songs that he played, he happily wrote it down for us.There are very few places in Singapore that has quality control over its music and Element is one of them. Thumbs up!The service was excellent, waitresses were polite and friendly although there were times when it was quite difficult to get their attention.. I am assuming it was because they were quite busy that night and short of staff. The female Caucasian manager (Anna?) was very knowledgeable about the food that was being served and also helped us to choose the right wine to go with our food. All in all, it was a very good evening for both my husband and me. As Element has a fantastic ladies night drink promo on Wednesdays, I should be returning here very soon with my colleagues and girl friends. I suspect my husband will be paying you a visit too! Keep up the good work

Tried the buffet here after using the promotion on deal.com.sg. I was initially quite impressed by the spread as it was worthy of all the other famous buffets in Singapore with oysters, lobsters, sashimi, chili crab and even peking duck to name a few. They also had free flow of soft drinks, which other buffets did not offer. However, 30 mins into the buffet I realized why this buffet did not rank as high as the others. Sashimi selection was quite restricted, they only had salmon, swordfish and tuna. Swordfish was good but ran out around 8.30pm (??!) even though there weren't many customers. Oysters were fresh but rather small and the staff were rather stingy in dishing the oysters out. Lobsters were tough and dry. The chili crab had disintegrated into the sauce (which was really quite tasty) and when i ask for more chili crab, the staff told me to take the sauce instead because "all the meat is inside". Peking duck was disappointing. Normally, the duck skin should be wrapped with the crepe. In this case, there was hardly any skin at all. In terms of service there were some staff that were friendly always with a smile, while there were also a few with the perpetual scowl on their faces. Overall, so-so experience... would not go back unless there were special promotions

I was just passing, I fancied a steak, saw they had it on the menu decided to stop. It was priced in the menu at $38 (approx √Ç¬£19) and I decided it must be worth it. It really wasn't. It was a rump steak, very fatty, I'd asked for it medium I got well done. I should have complained but given how long it took to arrive in the first place I didn't think it was worth it. The meat had probably been frozen as it was quite tasteless. The wedges, veg and sauce were good it was just a shame that the meat wasn't. I had ordered a diet coke with my meal and that was a shock when i got the bill $7! So all in all included service charge and tax I paid $53 - by far the most I have paid for any meal during my 3 weeks here. The staff were friendly and helpful, the food was overpriced for only an average meal

Not much variety on the buffet line, But they're pretty good quality. However, both chefs and service staffs are not very attentive. Ran out of oysters at 7.30pm, waited 15mins for a waiter to fill our glasses.
The ambience is nice.
5
Nice ambience for a girls' get-together. Birthday celebration turns out great with excellent service and help from the crew. Lovely photos with perfect memories. Great place to sit and talk and enjoy the food.
5
Good buffet spread except to requestforbigger oyster to go along with the champagne. Service thymbs up.
4
Though there is not much variety in the dessert, those that are available definitely have wet my friend picky taste bud.
He is already in his third round of the jelly dessert.
5
The Element cafe serves great foods plus excellent customer service. This is my regular dining place and I have brought many friends and loved ones here too.

After a full house no reservation turn down by the famous Japanese Ramen Restuarant nearby, me, my husband and our two kids decided to have our dinner at Element.Although it was a busy Saturday evening, staff were attentive and food were constantly replenished.Love the sashimi selection of fresh generous cuts but I think the hit of the night was the seafood section.I devour the lovely wide selection of prawns, slipper lobster, mussel and crabs.However, it would have been better if the oysters were bigger in size.Definately worth a return visit for the price we pay and the quality of the food

I dined at Element for the first time with my husband and we are quite happy at first when we were lead to our table by such a sweet hostess. Service was good when we arrive but from 8pm onwards there wasn't any service provided. The 3 service personnel who were in charged of the station (which was less than 50 guests) went missing out of the sudden. No refilled of water and no one offers us coffee and tea when we were having our desserts. We have to raise our hand and ask for someone attentions.The most incident which upset me was when my husband went to the sushi/sashimi counter, no one was there. So he waited for about 3minutes for the Chef to serve him some sashimi however still no one is there. So he waited and look around and saw one service personel coming towards his direction and so he asked the service personel whether is any Chef attending to this counter. The service personel replied my husband "i don;t know. Ask someone else and pointed at the 3 of the service personel who was standing at the cashier counter. I am not from this restaurant. I am from opposite." So does that mean you are not able to help eventhough you are wearing Amara Hotel nametag and just because you are from different outlets meaning you are not representing Amara Hotel? At least use a proper sentences instead of shutting my husband and make him sound stupid that he is asking the wrong service personel. So what really confused me was, since there are service personel walking around clearing plates, can't they see that someone was standing in front of an empty counter waiting to get something

I was at the restaurant on 6th April 2014 which is on sunday evening, i was so impressed with the staffs that really made my day. I came into the restaurant without any reservations, eventually i was arranged as a last minute walk-in guest though the restaurant was fully booked, as it was my wife birthday on that day. the ambience was so perfect n fastastic food was served from the buffet. i would highly recommend to my family n working colleague about the restaurant

Visited on a deal voucher for a three course set lunch. The new Spanish selection and chef at Element has gotten a lot of press in food blogs and mainstream media recently. My advice - don't believe everything you read. Our appetizers - Basque Fish Soup and Salad.The fish soup did have a unique and pleasing charred taste. However, it was completely under-salted and I had to be very liberal with my salt shaker to bring to an acceptable level. This is not a mistake a good chef, or even someone who tastes his food makes.The salad was very good - well dressed, fresh vegetables and very generous with little condiments throughout. Unfortunately this is the only dish the chef didn't actually cook.We added an extra pintxos A mushroom bruschetta, a small portion for 12 dollars. It was tasty and filled with savory stewed pork but the mushrooms were tasteless and for 12 bucks we could have done a lot better. Our main course - Pork Cheek, Fish/Tuna Stew.The pork itself was lovely - great texture with a rich wine sauce. Mash was up to expectations. However the dish was marred by a bunch of tasteless and barely cooked rough cut carrots. A totally pointless addition. Yes, i could have simply chosen not to eat the, but adding bad, random pointless components to a dish is not characteristic of a good chef.The tuna stew was absolutely hopeless. The stew itself was just ok - not offensive. But the tasteless potatoes and the tuna cooked to the texture of rubber riot bullets just made everything abysmally bad. What is the point of adding fresh tuna if you're going to cook it to oblivion with no seasoning whatsoever?Our desert was the worse of the lot - a tasteless egg pudding, covered with an equally tasteless caramel sauce, topped with whipped cream from a metal canister. This dish truly brings pointlessness to new heights. Some advice for the restaurant - if you're going to serve something like this, do everyone a favor and buy 3 dollar egg pudding from Tampopo in Liang Court. No, the Spanish chef is not "in his element" as the reviews would have you believe. There's just too much pointless and tasteless going on here. Unless I received "special treatment" for my deal voucher set (which I don't believe I did), I would most definitely not return to try the ala carte menu. Frankly, if you're gonna pull out all the stops and hype up everything, please try to make sure you deliver when it counts. The only saving grace is that I didn't pay full price, 38++ , for the set lunch

I visited for breakfast of March 25. We were there from 1030am to 12pm, my party of 4 had were told that we had to leave by noon, which we were fine with. The staff had hustled my entourage twice already by 1130am that we had to leave. At 11:40am I had already paid the bill, and we were finishing up a conversation, and always had the intent to leave before 12pm. At 11:45am again, the restaurant manager (tall gentleman who's name starts with "D"), again hustled us again. Being hustled three times infront of my guest at a premium restaurant BEFORE the due time (it was 15 minutes before we had to leave) did not amuse me. I spoke up and indicated to the manager that I don't appreciate it, and that it wasn't time yet. Unlike most hospitality service, he took a hard line stance that we need to leave by noon (but it wasn't noon yet). And I told him that I don't appreciate the excessive reminder, and he then made a statement that i haven't paid yet (which outraged me), which is untrue. I don't appreciate the level of service from manager of Elements, and believe the level of disruption to guest is intolerable. I don't recommend this place to anyone who is high expectations

Excellent food quality particularly the lamb rendang. Always impressed by certain hot dishes every time we dine at the buffet dinner.
Also the spread of food is very good too.
Highly recommend.
5
I liked all, variety of it"s buffet incredible as there is something for everybody regardless of where are you coming from and what you like to eat.

Went there for my wedding proposal. Food was nice overall, with the proposal successful makes everything even more better

Came in during lunch time with corporate clients. Greeted with smile at the doorstep which opens up our desire to a great eating experience. Really enjoy the oyster and will definitely come back for more. Prompt service from Sharon, Alisya and from the management, (did not get his name though). Excellent service and worth every single money spent
5
The moment we enter the restaurant, we are treated like a VIP showed to our table. Serve champagne and the food was awesome. Oyster is super fresh and snow crab too. The food was replenish almost instantly. The plates were cleared as soon as you stand up for another helping that make you feel like there is a butler waiting on you. What I will say is that the service rendered is more than what you paid for....My summary.... MONEY WELL SPENT!!
4
Food quite good... Nice environment and staffs are generally friendly. Here with customer and sittings are customer. No wet tissue to use after eating prawns etc
5
Very good food n service randered.. Money spent worthwhile.. Thumbs up to the team.. Management did a very well planned operation job.. Expecially their anticipate to the guest needs.. Being urgency to every guest needs and comfort all including us when we were element. Definately ill come back again very soon.. Cause of their warmness and really feel myself like home
4
It's good and worth the price. Highly recommended for people who love seafoods and dessert as they are fresh and delicious. The service staffs are great. Great ambience, great food and wine. It will be even better if there are ice cream as they only serves cakes
5
Really cant agree with previous reviews - I was here with a group of 12 and apart from the slight delay in getting the drinks order in the food was first class! I really liked the variety and the selection esp. seafood and Sushi made in front of you to your order - we all commented how excellent this place was for a group and I have no hesitation in recommending it for a buffet dinner option

We bought groupon vouchers for their dinner buffet. Very disappointed in the variety of choices. The offer included 1/2 lobster. This was served quite late into the meal and it was dry and had no taste. The service was very poor as well. We were shown to our table but no servers offered the drinks menu that was included in the buffet price. I had to ask the server to serve soft drinks at our table. Only two choices of soft drinks (pepsi and 7up). There was not a great deal of hot food choices around 8 dishes that included one beef dish, one pork dish, one mutton dish, rice, bean curd spring rolls, cabbage and a deep fried crumbed fish. Not worth the reduced price of $44.50 we paid for the buffet. Eat elsewhere
