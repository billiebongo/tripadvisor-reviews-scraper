Intimate and authentic caf√© with good value Vietnamese coffee and friendly service.
Tucked away on the lower level of The Plaza behind the Park Royal Hotel on Beach Road but definitely worth seeking out.

Best Vietnamese cuisine I had in Singapore! Awesome food at affordable prices. Love the baguette most - crispy bread on the outside, tender meat and generous fillings on the inside. The pho is also very tasty especially the soup. Best part of the spring rolls is the sauce - a secret recipe I was told by the owner, who is very hospitable. A must-visit and will definitely be back!

It is difficult to find quality Vietnamese food and coffee in Singapore, however; there is a hidden gem of Vietnamese cuisine at the basement level of The Plaza, adjacent to the Park Royal Hotel on Beach Road; Saigon Cafe.This is an exceptional choice for lunch or coffee with friends, or colleagues who appreciate the flavors of Vietnamese cuisine and coffee. The ambiance and atmosphere is reminiscent of the the charming coffee shops in Vietnam and the hostess and manager is exceptionally focused on quality food, coffee and customer service. You will want to add Saigon Cafe as a favorite selection for your lunch and every time you can select a different entree. Saigon Cafe is also an exceptional choice for a mid-morning or mid-afternoon coffee when you need to escape the stress and pressure of the outside world.Coffee connoisseurs will appreciate the exceptional quality of Vietnam coffee beans which are available for sale in Saigon Cafe

Most close to Vietnamese original taste that I could find in Singapore. Very tasty and reasonable price. Just around $6-$8 for a quick lunch at cozy place. The shop is small hence its warm and relaxing with French mix Vietnamese style.Recommend you try the stewed beef noodle
