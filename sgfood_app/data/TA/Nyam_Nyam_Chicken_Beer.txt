We bought a groupon voucher for this restaurant and decided to try it out last fri night as a family. The restaurant was quiet when we arrived so were unsure how good the food would be, We ordered the korean fried chicken which is their signature dish. They also had various other good korean dishes but we were aiming for a light dinner on this occasion. We were pleasantly surprised by the generous portion of chicken. The sauce was excellent, the seasoning perfect and chicken itself cooked to perfection....my 18 month old could not get enough of it! We were also offered a range of side dishes to try. From the kimichi to omelette , anchovies and various other yummy morsels, we decided we would definitely be returning for another meal soon.A special mention to for Chris our waiter who from the moment we sat down to the very end of our meal was a complete gem! He explained the dishes, made good suggestions and always had a smile. We will be returning soon
