Yummy food and drinks, but you pay for it. The staff is friendly but don't go out of their way for you.

Great if you like meat (duh). Tender ribs, tasty smoked chicken, great service, yummy drinks. What more could you ask for?

Meat Smith Little India (21 Campbell Lane 209894)Fantastic eatery with unique flavors; spicy and different probably the best experience we had from Singapore. Well prepared with top-motivated kitchen and staff. Experimental kitchen; so innovative and exciting, that we had to visit the restaurant three times. We had Coconut Chutney Pork Ribs, Date Glazzed Beef Rib, Bambay Butter Naan, Gren Mango Slaw and Gun Powder Potatoes in connecting with a lot of tasting

The premium meat platter has different meats from the meat platter. Good to order both for variety - Chicken, pulled pork, beef brisket, ribs and more. All every well done, succulent and tender. However some might find it too salty! The Mac and cheese wasn’t cheesy or creamy enough. The fries weren’t crispy and were cut in squares not strips. One serving of corn was 3 miserable ~5cm strips of a quartered corn cob! The cheeseburger was good. The selection of craft and draft beers were great! Leave space for desserts. We enjoyed the key lime pie and the banana bombe Alaska.

Visited using the Entertainer 2 for the price of 1 main course deal! My bf and I chose the beef rib and the lamb chops. The meat were both cooked to perfection and were so tender and flavourful with each bite! Very well seasoned and delicious. It was really good so we ordered an additional side of pork cheeks, that came crispy and fatty - but if you’re not a fan of pork fats, please avoid it! Everything was quite a small serving so I’m not sure if I’d be keen to pay full price for these. Ordered a sour cocktail which turned out VERY sweet - I think it was a pity as the refreshments menu seemed promising but kinda lack substance in the actual drink served.... very one/two dimensional even though they all seemingly had diff elements of ingredients. Even my bf didn’t think his Negroni was that good despite a Monkey47!The waitress was very nice to offer to replace my cocktail with a sour punch and I loved it! Overall the servers were very fun and friendly

LocationIt is located at the business district hence if you’re going there on weekdays, prepare for a crowd everywhere.The ambiance is good. It’s a small restaurant but the decoration of it fits the name and what they served!FoodSo food, it’s super good! Ordered the dry ribs, steak, mac and cheese, coleslaw and fried okra. The ribs just melts in the mouth with that yummy seasoning on top! While the steak is riched with flavors. Talk about mac and cheese, a lot of places in Singapore serve those ready made ones but this Restaurant makes their own and it is the best Mac and Cheese i’ve had in Singapore! And Okra, I don’t really eat it because of the sliminess BUT i had a bite and I’m surprised that it is well cooked and the taste is very good. Simple fried okra but Worth ordering!I visited this place on a Sunday afternoon and it’s much better as there’s no crowd. Quiet surroundings and you feel calmer eating and enjoying a good food and drink! And gives you time to explore the business district with little people around.MUST EAT HERE

Went there with 2 workmates. We ordered the poppers, 2 plates of briskets, a plate of ribs and mac n cheese. Poppers were excellent, just a tad salty but I’m sure not much could be done which they were wrapped in bacon. The brisket was very good, marinated was tasty and the meat amazingly tender. Ribs were not as impressive. They were 85% bone unfortunately. Will be back and give the ribs a miss

Noticed this venue when wandering around Little India.A little on the pricey side but we were on holiday and wanted to have a nice treat! Between two of us, we ordered the duck hearts, onion bhaji rings, glazed ribs and the pork belly. The onion rings were good, a slightly different twist on how they are usually presented. My partner really enjoyed the pork belly, which also came with biriyani style rice which wasn't mentioned on the menu - so a welcome extra. The ribs were amazing, glazed and sweet, with a mango based slaw on the side. Situated on a busy corner, also makes for good street / people watching! The friendly serving staff, happily answered our various questions about portion sizes and kept up topped up with water
5
Was my last night in Singapore so a colleague and I decided to check this place out. The food was amazing, the brisket was melt in the mouth. Service was quick and friendly, highly recommend if you are in the area. Though would recommend booking ahead as they were quite busy
3
Tasty, but meats served without any sides, unless it’s on the specials menu. About $110 for 2 meats (1-for-1 on Entertainer), 2 snacks and a side of coleslaw, and 2 beers. For the same price, you could possibly find many alternatives with bigger portions and just as delish.

Thank you to the smoke team and service crew at Meatsmiths tonight for putting out some amazing Thanksgiving affair... had a really good night and your food was on point!! Had a great evening, and really enjoyed the atmosphere and authenticity! #ComingBack

Went here for dinner as a friend had the Entertainer App which offered a 1 for 1 deal. Tried the wagyu ribeye and tomahawk steaks @ $ 95 each. The steaks were not bad but quite average compared to other meat places. Despite the 1-1 the bill worked out to be over $80 per pax which though not terribly expensive did not justify the quality. Service staff were pretty busy and it was a slightly difficult trying to get their attention. However, when attending to us they were helpful and professional. If anything, I'd reserve my compliments for the staff who were pretty good.

We walked down for a pulled pork based on a review - and no pulled pork. Second thru pretty well forced a high end bottle of water on us. I’ve always admired the interior design and marketing Guess u just didn’t notice it was such a rip off before.I will not be back

We were at Singapore during Thanksgiving and wanted a traditional Thanksgiving dinner with all the trimmings just like back home. We were surprised that the turkey was quite moist and tender, actually much better than some turkey served in American restaurants back home. The candied yams and the green bean were good too. On the negative side, the price was on the high side. Also the restaurant was skimpy on the pumpkin pie. For the 4 of us, two wanted pumpkin pies and two wanted pecan pies. The pecan pies came in typical serving size (about 1/8 of the pie), but for the pumpkin pie, it was half size (about 1/16 of the pie). Also we had to remind the waitress to bring us the pies way after we finished eating. But other than the dessert, the service was good. The atmosphere was casual with 70's music playing in the background. All in all, a very good eating experience

Don't Open all Day Sunday if you cant be bothered to give any service to any standard at all.Adam or Ant Or Ben "could not really give straight clear answer from him when asking for his Business Card". Which he did not have one. The Food however was a lot better then the service. Not great with the chef being off work on a Sunday. The Pork ribs where Luke warm. The Slaw was very very wet and a around 50ml of liquid was i the bottom of the bowl. We ordered the Rib but was told it was sold out 5 mins after ordering it. We was offered to order the Cowboy Steak double the price .. We chosse the Brisket - Which was lovely and the Okra Chips- Amazing.Break down of the F.O.H Comes Over And Offers Sparking water- We Ask For table Water - He huffs and says nothing and walks away from us to sit back down on his chair. after ordering food from Amazing Waiter, I Walk over the F.o.H manger to ask if he could turn of the Air Con. He looks up at me like WTF do you want... WE WAS THE ONLY people in the place . He does not even say a word to me.Instead of turning of the air con he decides to just re angle the air con. We had to ask the Waiter to then turn it off. Had you maybe given you Card we might of sent you a email instead of letting the whole web knowing how bad you were today. Massive Bitter Taste from today .Never before i had to write a review like this. But for a quick lunch at 107 dollars and to deal with this is not write. No Way would i tell anyone to go here..... How are you a sister place to our No one place to go to. Really hope some can explain why this attitude from the Front oF house Manager is o

I am a Texan living in Singapore. Like every self-respecting Texan, I take Bar-B-Q seriously, especially brisket, which is the State dish of Texas. At my home in Houston, Texas, I have a custom made smoker where I smoke a variety of meats, but mostly brisket. Often I order meat from the best cattle ranches in Texas to smoke in my smoker. I have sampled brisket in every corner of Texas and throughout the Southern portions of the U.S. With some level of authority, I can say that the brisket at MeatSmith is the best that I have ever tasted. The brisket is perfectly smoked and appropriately fatty - fantastic. The pork spare ribs are also divine. When I dine in the rustic dining room I feel like I am back at my favorite Bar-B-Q spot in Austin, replete with classic rock or, more often, country western music on the playlist. The brisket and pork spare ribs are so good that I have not moved beyond these two dishes in my many visits to MeatSmith. The serving size is a bit small but the quality far overwhelms the slight quantity. I would recommend reservations, even for lunch on a weekday. The small bar is well stocked with some of the best bourbons I have seen in Singapore, including Pappy Van Winkle and Blanton's

My wife and I recently enjoyed a birthday dinner for me at this cosy restaurant in Telok Ayer.The service from beginning to end was outstanding with recommendations well and truely appreciated. My wife chose this restaurant because of my love of meat so when we saw something on the menu called a Briskett Springroll, we wondered how this fitted into a Texas Smoked BBQ restaurant. We decided on ordering a Meat Platter and a Premium Platter and both contained the Briskett Springroll. We thought we'd ask if they could change this item for a Glazed Beef Rib but had our mind changed by the waitress. Let me tell you, it was a great suggestion, we loved them!The other items on the platters included pork ribs (tick), pastrami burnt ends (tick), dry pork ribs (tick) and pork belly (tick). Unfortunately, the highlight part of the Premium Platter was Mishima Wagyu Rib Eye but I found this a little undercooked. We enjoyed a side of Mac & Cheese as well as a Green Salad which both were delicious. The Green Salad was particularly fresh.Our dinner lasted around 2.5 hours as we sipped the bottle of Day Zinfandel red wine with the rustic ambiance providing a comfortable atmosphere.This is a great place to drop into for a nice evening meal but expect standard Singapore prices. Our bottle of wine was $130 and the total bill was $270

As a young fella on hols in the states I once stumbled upon heavenly brisket.... that I've been hunting down ever since.... Finally one wet and humid evening, 16 Asahi's in and too drunk to talk any sense, I stumbled to Meatsmith and demolished a tray of everything and a load more beer. I woke in a haze of vague, with a mouth coated in cow juice (not milk), and had this memory of the perfect slice of beef, between the mac n cheese, chicken burger & gherkins. I woke my sorry self up and forced a beetroot and carrot juice down the hatch, hoping for a burst of get-up-&-go, but did nothing other than illuminate my mornings stools. All day long I drifted to this beef I had the previous night. Eventually, after forever, 6 bells struck and a quick 8 Asahi's at The Exchange and I was back, with much more control of the taste buds. Mannnn, it was real - all of it (credit: Han Solo).We went for brisket, burgers, and every side you on offer. It's divine, like really divine. In the U.K. hunt I tried countless barbecues (reds etc) & every place with 'smokehouse' in the title.... and each and everyone let me down. They seem obsessed with drenching in some sickly sauce called BBQ sauce (cheap ketchup, white vinegar & calpol - I believe). But Meatsmith, they smoke with consideration and gift the cow and the cow alone to flavour the palette, none of this camouflaged flavouring business.So the next day the same again... hanging, hazy, beetroot & carrot, back sweats, temperamental meetings, no lunch & purple passings. Night came and 12 beers were inhaled & off I went to Meatsmith to get my fix. But tonight they had Tomahawk on the specials.... which, frankly driven by way too much Japanese beer, I jumped head first at. Cost a fortune and was designed to fit a table of 6, but SGD being nothing other than an expensive form of Monopoly money (takk M&S credit cards appreciation of the Manx resident), I thought what the hell. This thing was unreal - it was like a rib flavour with the texture of a smooth pate - just honestly unbelievable!By this time the big Aussie who I think must run the place was familiar and greeting each night appearance. Many more followed over the following weeks. The staff were ace, the foods just a joke (the smoke point flavours are 10/10), the beers superb (I was Pistonheading and Dead Pony Clubbing on tap) and the ambience and decor is a real treat.My best eating experience? No, probably not - Burnt Ends is just too good - but definitely one of my very favourite and enjoyable places. I mean, if I had a choice to eat at Noma or Meatsmith tonight I'd be going MS for a meat session without even thinking about it.Since my last visit I've seen some colabs with a few other places, including Dave P @ Burnt Ends, so presumably the bests are getting better!Cheers for making my Singapore trips a food memory not to be forgotten

We went to Meatsmith for a long lunch on the holiday today. What a place! We had the Premium Platter and sides - just WOW! The meats are so exceptional and show so much long and loving care of the meat, all perfectly done in different ways according to he different meats. Just so delicious. The sides - mac and cheese, coleslaw, pickles are exceptional as well. The music is eclectic, the servers really attentive, and watching the open kitchen over a couple of hours, you see how much work goes into such sensational food. Our only regret is not discovering Meatsmith years ago. Will be back. If you like a casual vibe, and really well done barbecue meat, you will love it

Walking around Talok Ayer street and I wanted to try some food at one of the many restaurants in this area as they seemed to be extremely popular with people who work nearby. I chose this restaurant after looking at the menu and because I could get seated outside on the street. Quick, friendly and efficient service. I chose the wet ribs and a beer as it was lunchtime. Ribs were tender, well cooked and a very tasty BBQ sauce. I thought the portion size was perfect but there are many other options you can add if you are really hungry. Good draft beer too. It's western in style and menu choice but I liked it.
5
All the different grilled meats we had were very good, and James was a very good host. All in all a very pleasant evening in the CBD
4
They offer you the best meat from Nashville and the steaks are generous and really good cooked.
The neigbourhood is incredible and vibrant, around Telok Ayer.
Excellent staff and good draft beers, just a little bit expensive.
A superb choice in Aelok Ayer.
4
I always order their "Pork rib" via foodpanda. It's really really nice. Personally I find it the best in Singapore. The meat is really tender that it falls off from the bone. Love it !!
Must try : Pork Rib, Messy fries
5
Meatsmith has a limited menu and that's exactly why the food is so good. Perfectly smoked meat. Try one the platters and you cannot go wrong. Small portions of various meat. So tasteful. And the bonus is great beers and a super friendly staff!
5
Walked from my hotel - The Fullerton Bay with my friends in search of a good meat place, something not too fancy, local - meatsmith was highly recommended and it lived up to its reputation. Try the premium meat platter - I quite loved it.
2
Had a decent meal the other day. Good selection of beers. Enjoyed their Wagyu ribeye (slightly under marinated and cooked), t-bone was slightly better. Tried organising a return visit with family. They overbooked the place and contacted me last minute (on a Saturday afternoon) saying they cannot fulfil my reservation. Manager over the phone gave me a take it or leave it option. Extremely unprofessional.
1
We have been huge fans of Meatsmith since they opened and have been many times, enjoying each one. However today marks the day that will be our last time coming. We ordered the special which was the “croque madame” along with some other items. After waiting about 20 mins for our order we were then informed that the “croque madame” in fact was bite size and by this time the rest of the food came out leaving the person who had ordered the croque madame no time to order anything else. The cheeseburger was cold and the coleslaw way too acidic. The service here was terrible and from this experience alone we will not be coming back and informing our friends the same.
5
I have been here for both lunch and dinner, and it gets packed!Do ask for their home made hot sauce, its amazing!Lunch - do try their pulled pork lunch special, its delicious!Dinner - The mac and cheese is amazing, the chicken wings are sweet with a hint of spice
4
Had a work dinner here.. two nights in a row. The brisket was amazing, the ribs, smoky, and tasty, lots of flavour, and while I tease, the roasted potatoes were amazing if you do have a vegetarian with you!, nice cold beers to go with the meat fes
5
We had started the evening badly down the road in Indo-Chine (don't touch it with a bargepole) with awful service and a bar full of packing boxes, and had to pay S$21 for a poor Margarita to boot. We went for a last minute booking at Meatsmith and were not disappointed. The service is first class, well done to the head man and Suresh especially (Suresh - keep going with the wine training, you are good at it). We went for the Tomahawk and it was an event in itself, easily enough for 5 of us and we were hungry. The starters before and the sides that came with it were outstanding. Its good not to have chips and it makes you think about other options which are just as good, the Mac/cheese being one. The Smores at the end by the way were game changers. Well done to all the team in front and in the kitchen, you have a great restaurant and we will be back
4
Meat is the thing! Great menu and not too packed with choices. Brisket fell apart nicely and the Mac 'n' Cheese was very tasty. Good value at $130 for two
5
The service by the manager from the beginning was outstanding, every request attended to promptly; great good , especially the platter, nachos and the king crab.. coming back soon!
4
Went there with some colleagues for lunch. Ate from their lunch set menu. I had a brisket roll and cornbread, and we ordered a couple of trays of mixed appetisers to share. Food was excellent - very well executed - and tasted fantastic. Was good value for money too,. Recommended

Meatsmith is inspired by American Southern style barbecue joints; & for this I must add a disclaimer here - I have had pretty dang mind-blowing barbecued meats during my year-long stay in Texas, so my pickyness for BBQ has been elevated to a certain level. Put it this way: Texas changed my life. Pre-Texas, I would never eat a barbecued anything. Post-Texas: I love barbecue when it's done right.It's not that I'm comparing what I ate to how the Texans do it, but this experience just fell short. Ordered the 1/2 Pork Spare Ribs ($25+) with House BBQ Sauce & Brisket ($28+), & when the plates arrived, the first thought that went through my head was: That's it?The portions here are small for the price that you pay. I'm thankful I had a Chope voucher + coupon code to offset some of the cost, but that doesn't change my overall sentiment that the portions are small. Then again, you *are* in the CBD so perhaps some might find this reasonable.Taste-wise, it was alright. The meats weren't tough, but the ribs weren't fall off the bone. Not terrible, but not mind-blowing. Unfortunately not enough to make me return here again.No service charge-- which surprises me because you'd think waitstaff would try to work cheerfully to earn tips, but no, the service was quite deadpan & even bordering on slightly grumpy.There also seemed to be some kind of miscommunication when my credit card was swiped-- they forgot to subtract the $50 of a Chope voucher that I had, even though the receipt said to. (But that was rectified quickly, thanks guys.) I mean, we are all humans so I am not blaming anyone, but just wanted to remind everyone to check their receipts before signing/walking away.... Because it's the 2nd time this week I was overcharged for a meal
4
Ordered the meat platter and the premium platter—both of the ribs were REALLY GOOD, but the wagyu was not (most expensive item and definitely not worth it). Didn't like that all the vegetables on the menu were pickled (at the time of this visit)...but the ribs were THAT good that I'll still give this 4 stars. Couple of other things on the menu looked good, so might go back and give the other items a try. Wasn't a fan of the wagyu cuz it was super chewy. It's like chewing on a meat gum that eventually becomes a roll of meat in ur mouth. Ew
5
Recommended: spring chicken with white bread sauce, mac and cheese and beef brisket. The meats are mouth-watering and smoked to perfection. The white bread sauce is creamy but not overwhelming; the dishes are balanced with picked beets or jalapenos so your veins don't feel like giving up halfway through the meal. The wine recommendations were spot on as well. Hats off to Raju and team for making our visit so pleasant, looking forward to more visits in future

Poor service. Ordered 1 stilled water (Aqua Panna Still) However unknowingly the whole table of 10 was served with with it! Luckily we checked the bill! And found out that we was charged with 6 bottles of it! Not that we cant pay, but who in the world would want to pay for something that you do not order!Apparently they reduced the charges to 3 bottles after an argument. At the end of the day they said there re 2 sides of the story! Is this how you handle your customers!!! There s even no apology from Meatsmith's end!Lastly we are overcharged on the service fee too! 387$ is charged with $40 service fee, looks like your system couldn't even count properly!Is the food good? Blah! The whole experienced ruined it!Affiliated with burnt ends! Totally a big shame
4
Visited meatsmith with the family. Service was top notch, the manager was very friendly, he even encouraged our gramps to use her hands for the chicken wings (which she did).It's rare to see service of such standards on a busy & crowded evening.Meats were delicious, 2 servings of brisket, ribs & burnt ends. Absolutely loved the garlic bread as well
4
Good steak and ribs. The cheese taco was also very good. They allowed us to bring in a durian cake from outside to savour in the restaurant, and a complimentary chocolate lava cake was also served as Birthday cake for my son, very pleased with the extraordinary service from the Indian (couldn't recall his name) captai
4
If you are just wanting a no-fuss meat-fest then look no further, Meat Smith is the place for you. Vegetarians beware, this is not a place for you! Menu is relatively simple - I’d recommend the meat platter (See photo) that gives you some variety and is easily enough for 2 people. Staff a very friendly/helpful as well. Highly recommended
4
We ordered the platter as there were 4 of us. Tried the salads and the mac & cheese. Meats were quite good including the chicken, which was tender and quite fragrant. The portions were sufficient. Mac & cheese was great.
4
One of my favorite restaurant here in Singapore. Very nice to chill, cozy ambiance and super great food but unfortunately we're so disappointed to our recent visit due to one of the filipina server is very rude (didn't get the name). And I'm super surprise with her attitude coz I didn't expect that to a Filipina. Her face totally show unhappy and tired of her job. And she also approach us rudely that she need the table immediately. But the rest of the staff are great. We will still dine even she's still working there. Hope the management can talk to her and uplift her mood
5
One of my favourite smoke houses in Singapore; staff are friendly and accommodating. The food is absolutely amazing and cooked at a very high standard for BBQ; everything is fall off the bone and juicy! It's can be a little pricey, but your paying for the quality. The service / wait time can also be a little slow, however this is mainly because their always cram-packed with custom, not due to bad service!! Always an excellent meal here, never leave unsatisfied or hungry!! Burnt Ends, Short Rib and the Smoked Ice Cream are an absolute must here!
4
Enjoyed dinner here with my daughter a few weeks ago and had the pleasure of meeting the Welsh Rugby Sevens team who were also checking it out.The location on Telok Ayer street is great with indoor seating and a little bit of communal outdoor seating on the sidewalk, we went for the communal outdoor seating and it was fun chatting to some of the other people.We had a pulled pork sandwich and a brisket sandwich and both were really good. Just the right size and very, very tasty. A very good BBQ experience and one that we shall repeat.Service was very good and efficient. Not the cheapest eat in Singapore, but worth it. If you live in Singapore or are visiting and hankering after some BBQ then I would recommend trying Meat Smith
3
As the name of the restaurant goes, you will find mostly neat items on the menu. We tried the pork jowl, pork ribs and nachos. Food was good and though the portion looks small for the mains, it was actually quite filling. It actually got to a point where we felt it was too meaty. Nevertheless, is a good place to go if one feels especially hungry.
1
We just came back from the restaurant located in Telok Ayer.For starter you get 3 chicken wings- not tasty at all! The brisket was so fatty it was im[possible to eat!The salad was good! but thats not why we go to Meat restaurant.All together it was a bad , not worth the 80$ for 1 starter one briskt and one salad! I pay for good food, Its part of the enjoyment. But I was upset as we went to this place beacause of a review in Expat magazine - it looks like thgis review was not a very honest one
5
This is a great casual place to go for lunch or dinner, if you appreciate excellent meat quality. The meat is prepared in 2 huge smoke-ovens and slow-roasted 1/2 a day. It is wow-tasty and tender. Prices are pretty reasonable for Singapore. Will go soon again ..
4
We stumbled upon Meatsmith by accident (we were lost trying to find the spiffy dapper bar) on our first night in Singapore, we had already eaten but sat outside to have a refreshing drink. The manager James came to talk to us and was so polite and enthusiastic about his restaurant that we made the effort to go back a few night later for dinner.James found us a table in an already busy diner and recommended we try the shared meat platter. There was a variety of very well cooked barbeque meats and bread.After our meal and drinks James being the perfect host took us to the bar we had been looking for on our first night in town.Fully recommend a visit to this up and coming restaurant. Well done James for excellent customer service

Pretty good American-style BBQ for a joint in Singapore. They don't have all the items you find in Texas (for example no sausage), but they make up with other dishes, like fish (yes!), bone marrow, cracklings, Chongqing ribs (to be avoided as the fried ribs are way too dry!), etc. In spite of the high prices, the portions are not large, so do order appetisers or sides (the Mac and Cheese is subpar, though). Good drinks. Friendly service, albeit a bit slow
3
We took the 4 persons meat platter + 2 sides.The beef was tasty, a big beef rib and beef breast, all smoked. They added a dry quarter chicken to the platter. And a bone with marrow. I have never eaten that before and it was good.Craft beer available.The weak Aussie waiter forgot to bring my wine. It did not matter, the wine is too expensive anyway and so I paid only for my water.Not so sure whether I want to bring business partners there again. There are better restaurants nearby
4
As the name suggests, this is the place for meat lovers. loved the szechuan style ribs and the creme brulee dessert
4
They serve amazing ribs and other meaty dishes in variety, as a vegetarian course was available as well. Staffs were usually friendly and helpful while we were there in a big group. Located on the famous club street, but this one definitely stands out! But wine is very expensive as anywhere else
5
Out of know where, We advised of something new and different in Singapore. Deep South smoke house called Meatsmith. The atmosphere and décor reminder me of my time the USA. Licence plates on the walls and a lot to thought into the Décor.The beer selection is amazing and they have a few crazy ones on the list to. The staff area amazing more then welcoming
3
This is a very casual place with quite loud music.The beef rib was good with excellent bark but the chicken wings a bit limp and insipid-they should have crispy skin.Friendly service and interesting wines especially from the USA make the place quite fun but you feel with a bit more effort from the kitchen it could be much much better.Very small choice of unappealing desserts and no decent coffee make a disappointing end to the meal
4
The place (Meat Smith) looks quite casual from the outside, with its black fronting and unambiguous iconography. Inside, there are some very large solid wood dining tables, which I would guess easily sit 10+ at a go (great for a party), with smaller tables on the sides. They have done a good job at fitting out the place, which must have been quite challenging as it has very low ceilings and is relatively compact. We liked the vibe, and there is also outdoor dining for those not minding the Singaporean heat. At the friendly waiter's suggestion, we selected the $135 meat platter. I was wondering if this would be adequate for four hungry mouths, but it did not dishearten. The choice cuts included a selection of ribs, Brisket steak, and smoked chicken. The meat was all very tender and flavorsome, and was more than enough to satisfy us all, it sure makes it very good value. We chose some accompaniments of Potato Salad and an interesting Thai inspired coleslaw. A big thanks to the staff they were friendly and very efficient I will definitely return to try their other food. All in all, Meat Smith is a welcome addition to the local dining scene. It's not fine dining at any extend, but for a no nonsense meat blow out, at sensible prices, it's hard to beat. Would highly recommend
5
Where do I start - with the starters! We selected almost every starter to share. Each and every mouthful was delicious! So full of flavour that worked perfectly with our wine. We moved on to a shared platter of mixed meat - I was almost done but had to sample. Again mouthwatering flavour that was so unique. Thankfully we had hungry boys to finish it all off. Fit not need dessert but had to try - yum. Could not fault the food at all - would certainly return
4
Restaurant was really crowded on a Friday night. Highly advise to make a reservation before heading there, especially for big groups. Service was decent, although granted it was a really busy night. Portions was decent sizes, would recommend ordering dishes to share if in a group, so that you can try different offerings. It was a friend's birthday and the staff was nice to accommodate our request to place the candle in the nacho bowl and surprise our friend with it
5
It was an awesome choice for our dinner with good friends. I loved the taste and perfectly cooked meat and fish. Still moist and well flavoured. Lovely place with good service. A well spent dinner! Abit pricey but overall a positive experience. The fried rice was really yummy.
3
I waited a day or so before posting this review as don't like to criticise restaurants in general. Ribs are a cheap cut. I know that Singapore rents are high but sgd33 for a rack of ribs seems a lot to me, as a U.K. Guy. Imagine what I felt when the charged 33 dollars for half a rack with no sides. Just a side plate with ribs on it. I was amazed. Lived in hk london and Sydney and one of the most ripped off I have felt. Couple with this that the ribs were not great. The venue is very nice tho but down to style over substance. One of my lowest marks unfortunately
4
Walked around looking for brunch on Sunday and Sarnies was too hot and busy, My Awesome Cafe space is too small to fit a stroller. Had dinner hear before with friends so stopped to have brunch today for the first time. The serving size is HUGE! I had breakfast burrito, my husband had sausages and biscuit while my friends have bacon and egg sandwich. My husband liked his dish and I liked mine. While ladies had soda (lavender lemonade was great)the gents had alcohols (Bloody Mary and Booz and Juice). Bill came out to be about the same as Sarnies. Coffee at Meat Smith was not as good as Sarnies and My Awesome Cafe but we think value for money is much better at Meat Smith.

One of the good BBQ restaurant. Had Chicken Wings, brisket and Dino Ribs which was too good, worth a visit.
3
Steam punk vibes with decent food. Cocktails were superb. Some staff member were very intrusive and we could not have a decent conversation while we were enjoying our meal. Would give this place a miss, BurntEnds all the way!
5
As someone who loves proper BBQing but am no longer able to due to moving into an apartment this restaurant is a God send.
Brisket is amazing as are the ribs but don't forget to book... It's no secret anymore.
5
Absolutely delicious, wings, boneless chicken and the most delicious BurntEnds Bahn Mi Burger I have ever tasted in the universe!!!!
5
I simply love their pork rib. Its one of the best in town. Tender and juicy, w a magical sauce. I usually order from foodpanda. Their "dirty rice" is also a must try !
5
We came as a group of 7 (including 3 kids) and tried a whole range of food and loved everything. The pork croquettes were a highlight though! Service was extremely friendly too.
3
Good smoked meats and sides to boot that makes you feel like you are eating at a more fancy BBQ joint from America. There are specials that you can try as well as the platters for the group. Not a huge drinks menu - the usual cocktails and a very small wine list. If you like beef then the Dino ribs are definitely something you should try.
4
great food, reasonable price. The only problem I had with this place was the service. The food although comes at a good time, they forgot out drinks at the beginning. Despite reminding two difference waitresses, finally when the drinks came, they got one order wrong (only 2 drink orders). Lastly, being a meatsmith, I would probably make the menu serve nothing but "meat", and take off items like mac n cheese, fish, fried chicken wings - that totally doesnt belong to a place like this! the sandwich should be open face on ciabatta, not a cheap 1$ fair price hamburger bun
5
Delicious food and cocktails, all with an interesting twist. We had the ribs and bone marrow. As others have said the portions are not enormous, but the taste is great and nice to enjoy the flavours rather than be overwhelmed by the size. Really good cocktails too with friendly and helpful staff
5
Went with family and they were not disappointed.. the pork croquettes were unexpected and crunchy.. The meat platter and beef ribs were outstanding...Dessert honey pie was unexpected and the brownie to die for (Fudgy which I love)...Average cost for 4 was $50 which was reasonable. It's upmarket meat and can't be compared to the main stream American rib joints
3
Surprising to have such small portions, especially for an American restaurant. Why say the BBQ platter is good for 4-6 and have the tiniest portions of sides? Also, the $24 sea bass was as small as my palm and thinner.
5
Easy, noisy, tasty, relaxed, gorgeous cauliflower cheese, beer on tap, ribs of beef cooked for days (probably not but as tender as though it has been!). Go here for an un-rushed tasty steak & beer.
2
Menu changed. No more pulled pork sandwich. Beef brisket was dry and 2 strips as main, pricey and standard/quality dropped. Too much spices/powder on spicy wings. Pork ribs dry and with spiced powder again. Won't be coming back.
2
This was the second time I have been here. The first was for a dinner with six or seven friends -- lotsa ribs, brisket, meat, meat, meat. Very good. This time Teo of us showed up for a lunch reservation at 1.30 pm and was handed a limited brunch menu. None of the things I had been looking forward to eating again was available. We ended up with a brunch platter -- eggs, hash, sausage meat and a green salad. Honestly I could have fried up a much better meal at home. The service was also scant and the place wasn't busy. So fail for Sunday brunch. Disappointing.
4
Arrived Friday night, with a mix of expats and locals, wasnt so hungry, so not sure if made right selection. Got some advice from the knowledge waitress, and went for the ribs not disappointed, best ribs I had since moving from Australia to SE Asia. Of course not cheap eat but good value for mone
4
Heard loads of positive and great comments of this little joint at Telok Ayer! Was highly recommended by a friend to try the brisket and cauliflower from the side menu. We also had the pork ribs and the bone marrow which was alright.Kudos the the chef!!We will be back for sure
5
There were 5 of us and as we were not very hungry, we ordered the meat platter for 2 to 3 plus chicken wing! The meat was overwhelming too much!!! But they were damn nice and awesome especially the beef brisket! The meat was really tender and cooked till perfection :) The set includes bone marrow. It was rather unique and it was ate with bread!
4
I came for an early lunch on a Saturday afternoon and was the only customer for the next 15 minutes. This allowed me to soak in the atmosphere of the place. You can actually see the money spent on renovations, from their wooden dining tables to their bar counter, and especially in their bar stools, remodeled from gas pumps (or so I think). I had the fried chicken sandwich for $12 and it was spicy! Prices here are what you would expect in a hipster restaurant- a bit high for the portions and quality served. But considering the other places out there, I would say they are not more expensive. I would just stick to the sandwiches though, the ribs and meats look really expensive!
3
The menu is really specialised and limited. A few people looked at the menu then left.The boss and male waiter were rather unfriendly. When I said I would drink alcohol he said there were other non-alcoholic drinks. When business is poor, the right thing to do is to review one's offering and marketing, and ensure customer service is excellent. My friend said the Smith BBQ fruit punch did not taste like cocktail. He was right. It was sweet like medicine.The pork croquettes were passable although they could be more tender. They were a bit chewy.My half smoked chicken was not bad. The meat was moist and flavour was good.My friend had the half pork spare ribs. He was unimpressed and commented that Tony Roma's was much better.The only decent offering we had was the dirty fried rice. I decided not to risk desserts which may not be good
5
Singapore is full of plenty of nice restaurants. If you are looking for a great place to eat with a small group or family this is the one. The food is great for meat lovers, but also has some of the best salads and don't pass up on the freshly made on premises bread. We tried the brunch menu over the weekend and the breakfast burrito can be recommended
4
Melt in the mouth meat with wonderful tasty exterior - the Nebrascan who runs the smokers is a magician.
4
Went there last night for a wine dinner. Great food, especially the meat (funnily enough). Featuring steak, ribs, chicken and some varied veg, I would definitely go with this as a staple. Not sure what the pricing is like ala carte, but worth a visit.
4
Had lunch with a friend. Portions weren't large but ok for the price. Had the brisket which was moist and tender. Place isn't large and tends to get a little noisy when crowded.
3
Ambience - Casual, relaxed atmosphere and good place to chill
Food - T-Bone was great, Marrow and Ribs were good, Desserts mediocre
Service - could improve
1
I've been here a few times and the food is okay as well as the service. There are better places to go in the area, so don't bother. If you can hold out, go elsewhere.
2
chicken wings were smothered in dry rub such that every inch had a thick powdery coating - almost inedible. brisket was slightly dry and flavorless, had to be rescued with liberal lashings of barbecue sauce. pork ribs were ok. the barbecue ones benefited from the thick coating of barbecue sauce and stayed moister than the memphis dry rub ones. sadly, the best items on the table were the pickles ..
2
Portions weren't very big and the meat was average, which was obviously surprising. I had been so looking forward to this was I was massively disappointed. Pork ribs were dry, chicken came in pieces that we couldn't cut which didn't make sense because it was a sharing platter, and the brisket was soft but flavour less. It also got very noisy with the crowd and chatter, to the point where we couldn't hear each other. Unless you were sitting right under an air vent, it also got very warm. (If you want good meat, go to Decker at Robertson Quay - they serve much of the same food but the quality is much better. No affiliation!
3
The brisket was melt-in-the-mouth but wasn't very flavoursome. The mac and cheese was mustardy but didn't have the creaminess I was expecting. Especially given it was $26 and $10 respectively, I was hoping for more. This is still pretty good by the standards of American BBQ outside of America, and give it a go if you want a taste, but I had much better BBQ in Sydney recently
4
Great place for dinner and to chill. The meat platter is great and comes in a very large serving. I'm not a chicken fan because the chicken in the meat platter was simply amazing and was easily my favourite meat in the dish. Coleslaw + Mac & Cheese were great sides too! Use the Entertainer App to make your money's worth.
5
I love this place, I suppose its because I love meat. It is difficult to find beef ribs in Singapore that is not stewed or swimming in sauce so we went here for the good old grilled one. I have to say that it's fantastic. We started off with the Bone Marrow and it's absolutely divine. I was hoping to get another order just because my husband was my competition but settled down to have Pork Rinds which was good but not as much as when my heart stopped for the Bone Marrow. The Mains came- Brisket and Beef Ribs. My Beef Ribs as expected was good while the Brisket although tasty was quite a tough one. I realized then if they should ask the client for the doneness? We capped the night with their Mud slide thinking it might be an ok dessert considering they only have only two in their menu but I was mistaken. It was also incredibly good. Fantastic place for a carnivore. There was a queue which I have expected given how good the food were. I have to add that their staff are fantastic too
4
Great service and atmosphere but a little cramped and very hot inside the restaurant. Food was a little expensive but very nice.
5
Been there quite a number of times and still loving the food. Everything from the smoked meats to the cauliflower with blue cheese to the lip smacking garlic bread with melted cheese inside always satisfy.
4
Went here for a quick bite to eat and loved the smoky infused air just stepping into the restaurant. The brisket sandwich was delicious and as you'd expect from a southern style smokehouse. Portion sizes are ample - but it's quality over quantity from my experience. Perfectly paired with a beer or Californian wine
5
Now have tried both a business lunch and dinner on the weekend. The short menu for lunch is fantastic and my favouritemwas the pulled pork roll.Dinner off the larger menu we tried the selection of different meats which was super because you get to sample everything !Wines and beers were reasonable and good....ask them for guidance as I did and their knowledge gets you the result !Enjoy )
5
walked past this place a few times now - i'll be stopping for a bacon sandwich one morning soon. Met a couple of contacts for a business lunch - brisket was really succulent, pork ribs had an amazing rub and fell off the bone and the beef rib... come hungry, it's awesome.Some decent beers available as well - it's worth a try if you like meat. Service is good, food is good although I did see some high prices on the menu
3
The meat is good but it felt like a fast food joint which at this price point isnt goodThe meals arrived literally a few seconds after ordering so we were finished within 45 minutes. It was possibly the strategy to get the maximum number of covers on a friday evenin
3
The best thing at MeatSmith is the service and warm feeling that diners can get to enjoy. Everybody's friendly. It's crowded when we were there so when the chef saw we were not getting the attention of the waiters so we can place our orders, he stepped out of the kitchen and took care of us. In this regard, kudos to THE Chef and his staffs :) Also, I love the open kitchen a lot! For some reason, It made me feel like we're dining on a chef's table :) Moving on to the food; I/we actually expected more. Meat's delicious but not super. I thought meat could have been more tender. That night, the food we had gave me the impression that it's not super fresh :( Like what I said earlier, it did not wow me but meat's not bad. The good thing is, they have variety of sauce that helped spice the food up! So overall OKAY. Drink wise, I can only speak for one cocktail; House Old Fashioned. Strong and delicious! According to my husband and our friend, beers' good, too! Once in a while when my carnivore side kicks in, i would still come back to this place
3
Meat smith is perfect for meat lovers who don't mind food without salads or greens. A lovely ambience, friendly bar tender and proactive servers - I would rate it high on service. The beef tongue starter was exceptional but the chicken wings were over fried and lacked the fun of an accompanying nice dipping sauce. The pork ribs were decent - a little dry and almost cold though. We may return to the place for their starters and cocktails more than the mains. Lively place for after work catch-ups.
4
Perfect place for those who moved from the US and want to feel 'at home' enjoying the smoked meats and ambiance - we almost forgot we were dining in Singapore until we came out of the restaurant! Food: I personally enjoyed the starters more than the mains (a bit less juicy than i expected). Beef tongue was our favorite! Service: Average but the place is rather busy and its better to reserve else be ready to wait for long! We managed to get a table @ the bar which worked well for us.Drinks: Great cocktails and a decent selection of craft beers Overall, a good experience and worth coming in big groups to enjoy their BBQ platters! We will be back for sure
3
I stopped by for lunch on a Friday & was promptly seated even though the majority of tables inside were already reserved. It helps if you're flexible & can sit at the counter. The menu as is expected focuses on meat. I ordered a half slab of ribs with dry rub & the beef brisket along with a side of cabbage slaw. The ribs weren't as tender as I'd liked them to be. The rub on them was way too salty for my taste but tempered by the three sauces available: brown sugar BBQ, Chilli Chipotle & Mustard Honey. Of the three, the brown sugar BBQ worked best. The brisket was tender & flavourful with a nice layer of fat. The tartness of the slaw & the pickles that came with both meats balanced the meat. Overall, I am not in too much of a hurry to return. Service was competent & the crew was friendly though.
5
The food was excellent, meats were well grilled well and of high quality and the service was impeccable.
4
Cosy and nice ambiance to hangout and chill with some friends. Food was ok, while the beer was great to wash down the mainly oily food.
5
An excellent visit as always - great food, atmosphere and service. I'll never hesitate to go again!!
3
Visited here for the first time having had good reports from others that had been. Have to say in my opinion it was only average.We ordered the beef tenderloin, spare ribs, chicken, coleslaw and salad between four of us. This in reality was not sufficient for 4 adults. The meat yes was tender, but in parts had a lot of fat on it. The spare ribs hardly had any meat on them. Not having any other accompliements to go with the meal (vegetable or potatoes) you was left felt wanting more. The drinks were very expensive, beer especially. Would I go back - no I do not think so.
3
The waitresses and waiters were very friendly and helpful, a call was made prior to the reservation and i would say a 10/10 for the location as it is conveniently located near two MRTs, Telok Ayer and also Tanjong pagar, near clark quay mrt too. The location was quiet, the drinks were amazing, however, i would comment that the portion size for the sizes were disappointing, especially the mac and cheese, along with the calamari, 10-14 for a small bowl. Next up, we tried the platter for two, the volume was great, the beef rib was superb, other than the fact that it was really salty at certain portions of the rib, along with the pork rib, which has too much dry rub on it? Perhaps the rub could be lessened? Due to the over seasoning of the pork and dinosaur beef rib, the duck leg was very plain, however, the texture of the skin was spot on. Good place to go to, if your tastes are more towards the salty side, do avoid if you are very very health conscious, dislike salty food, or have pre existing conditions like hypertention.
4
Having tried the burgers here last time and having heard a few people speaking positively about the ribs, I had to come back for another visit to try them. Very soft meat, not too much fat, quite tasty all round. Only real let down is that they are served with the tiniest of side dishes. A little disappointing not to include a few more vegetables with the meal
4
I went here on a last minute whim with some friends who were in the know. The set menu for the night was a 5 course meal which revolved around fish which I was a bit disappointed about as it's called 'Meatsmith'! however the food did not disappoint. The dessert for me was the absolute winner and I could have hoovered down 2 of them. We sat outside as we were in a group and have a really great time. Something the locals know about it..
4
Oh how tender and tasty the pork ribs were! Falls off the bone but chunky too. texture and taste are both key as we too often judge ribs by how soft they are. the brisket take that softness too far - too fatty / gloppy. The sides were medium, good but nothing to write home about. I can't recommend the mud pie either. But honestly we went there for ribs, and the smith delivered!!
5
The place is very close to CBD. And it is crowd during the lunch. Better to have reservation. Definitely a must try for meat lover. Beef is very tender. Both dry and wet rib are great. Be careful of the portion size. Four adults cannot finish the four plates..
3
Tried this restaurant and despite the expensive price tag, nothing really lives up to a great experience. We had lunch there, the table next to us was speaking about a "one eats free promotion" when 2 dine. This did done leave a good impression especially when you pay $180 for two and the food you have just eaten is really not that good
5
We indicated that we were there for our wedding anniversary and were congratulated by staff upon arrival. We were also given free champagne on the house. The pork ribs were absolutely tender.
5
Very nice ribs and roast chicken. Only minor grumble is that the tables are very close together but it's not really a problem.
5
Great Casual place for either Lunch or Dinner.
Good food, especially the chicken sandwich (but spicy...)
4
Reminds me of the good BBQ when I lived in Texas!! Do not forget to try out the Chipotle sauce too. Mmhm
4
A casual American restaurant. But by far the best American smoked ribs and meats in Singapore!! The smoked chicken is really a great find! Flavourful and tender and moist!!
5
Great produce cooked with flair....loved the spicy chicken burger ( and other burgers ). Beer cold, well-priced and well-chosen. This place has great atmosphere and obviously well-run with energetic team in kitchen and on floor. Upmarket bar meets steakhouse. Get there but expect to wait on busy nights without a booking.
3
Had dinner with my ex colleague after work on a Friday. We had the house red (Malbec) and shared a roasted chicken, bbq wet pork ribs and a bacon Mac and cheese. Our favorite the pork ribs! Totally delicious. Then comes the Mac and cheese. I must say the portions are not huge. So for the price, it is not really value for money. Thank God I was using the entertainer app. There as a queue about 7ish so it must be quite a popular joint. Probably won't be back again unless I am around the neighborhood.
3
Came here last week for lunch, having noticed this place a few times and observed how popular it was. We went for the sandwich set of pulled pork which came with a beer and ended up costing about $20 all in. Food was reasonable, but it's really very noisy inside the restaurant. You have to speak very loudly to be heard. If I come back I think I'd like to try the ribs or some of the other smoked meat choices
4
The restaurant gives me a "hole in the wall" feel, in a super cozy way! It's not the most prominent of locations, but you will be surprised at how packed the place is during dinner. Food wise, as suggested by the name of the place, you can barely find any veggies on the menu. In place of greens, they have meat in most forms. For starters, we ordered reuben rolls which was super yummy. Russian dressing fitted in so well. Pastrami was also soft. We also asked for mac & cheese which was 2 notches down from reuben rolls. i felt it was too cheesy and got a little "sick" halfway through. We ordered 2 mains - nashville fried chicken and beef rib. Nashville my friend was way too spicy for me. Restaurant manager very kindly "scrapped off the spicy mix on the chicken" and re-fry for me. Super crispy and flavorful dish to share. My partner had the beef rib that was crazy tender and literally melts in the mouth. We had no stomach for desserts after the delicious meal. We left fat and happy
4
Very enjoyable smoked BBQ that you'd expect to find in Southern US.Food and value for money were very good. This is a place I would easily go again. The brisket was really nice; fatty, tender, and a fantastic crust. Was lucky to get an end piece. Only thing to improve would be too have a larger portion option.Had a few sides; mac and cheese, slaw, potato salad. Mac and Cheese had a slight mustard flavour which set it apart from other m&c I've had but not necessarily better. Didn't have the bacon flavour I expected. Was good but won't be dreaming of this. Slaw was okay and nice contrast to the meat and Mac but not special for me. I didn't have the potato salad but my companions said it was good. If, or rather when, I go back will likely dispense with the sides and just order 2 servings of the brisket. And give the mac and cheese another shot.
5
Meat smith never fails at serving delicious meats along with equally impressive sides and appetizers. Service is great as well. One of our favorite restaurants in Singapore!
4
Loved the beef tongue, beef ribs & brisket. The pork ribs was so so...alil dry compared to the beef ribs. The honey butter was also nice with the buns.
4
Foods are awesome. House wine is not bad at all. Meat quality is really good. The only flop is the atmosphere of the restaurant, too crampy n very loud. Everyone is like shouting during meal
1
Despite making a reservation, i had to wait 15-20 min to get served, only to be told they were out of all mains. The wait staff were not interested in hearing any feedback on this poor show. I ended up leaving.
5
Meatsmith delivers with lots of well flavored food,... Headed down late, it was after 10pm, but kitchen was still rocking out stunning good food for us...A great place to head down on a weekly basis for a couple of beers, great food and to indulge in that good buzz of happiness... Meat / Beer / cool vibes a.k.a MeatSmith!
5
This is my 2nd review of Meatsmith. I'm a regular customer, goes there at least once a month since I first patronized this lovely restaurant on 1 April 2015. Was there last Thur (19 Nov) with a girlfriend. It was my 3rd visit in 3 weeks. Her opinion : Meatsmith has a friendly and soothing ambience for diners; food is yummy and pricing is reasonable; and a personalized service to cap our wonderful evening there. My friend was very grateful to John, the manager. He was alert, noticed my friend's pair of reading glasses on the floor and picked it up. As always, the wait staff is very attentive. I was sitting facing the wall, my back to the restaurant main area. I looked behind me twice, hoping to see a waiter nearby. There were none. But a short while later, one waiter approached me as he saw me looking around. Most other restaurants' wait staff will only approach you when you've caught their eye. The food here is superb, excellent American Southern cuisine, good variety of drinks, all at reasonable prices, and in a warm relaxing setting. What makes this place stands out time and again is the excellent, warm and personal service
4
Best for greasy food ... but sometimes a bit too greasy than needed. Good beers, pilsners and the usual strange craft beer selection.Pulled pork sandwich is one to try. I have been a number of times and visited soon after it opened picking up their briskets and other types of meat accompanied by some tasty condiments.Decent staff too
4
I spent an evening with friends trying out the fare at Meatsmiths. The food is of reasonable quality, not too much choice that you can't decide. Cocktail drinks were served interestingly in stainless steel mini buckets (really mini), and the Apple Cobbler was a real winner. The meat dishes are big and 'man size', for meat lovers, enough to get stuck in. Young clientele, nothing fussy with the interior, it just does what it says on the tin
5
The BBQ platter is the best if you are going as a group... everyone gets a decent helping of the meat as well as the awesome sides. The group of friends are still trying to decide which was better, the dry rub BBQ ribs or the brisket. And some good craft beer to wash it all dow
5
The distant cousin of the amazing Burnt Ends is getting better every day. They have added a "must try "1kg T-bone for 125$ that easily serves 4 . The chef , a Nebraska native, is a true master. He delivers high quality at reasonable (for Singapore) prices. The premium smoked brisket and short ribs are to die for .Interesting side - smoked cauliflower, deep fried okra, etc. He pickles everything in house , from beets to jalapenos . Great craft beer on tap and in bottles . Home made pickle shots . Great place for groups .
3
First and last visit. Wasn't particularly impressed by the food. The only redeeming factor was the T-bone steak.
4
Very friendly crews, thumbs up for their services!
Good place to gather.
Need to improve on their air condition.
4
Had the pastrami sandwich. Juicy and yummy, although a tad on the salty side. Restaurant was a bit noisy, so be prepared for a boisterous meal.
3
Good chicken, but only just cooked, very tasty though. Good mustard potato salad.
Nice draught pilsner.
5
Same guys behind the Asia Top 50 Restaurants Burnt Ends - great American BBQ pull pork and brisket. Grilled cauliflower and mac and cheese sides are amazing as well. Really good value for money lunch sets - sandwich+side+beer is hard to find in CBD!
5
Really was not expecting to find such a successful BBQ joint in Singapore. Everything was soft as butter and completely delicious. We had the platter and we could have scoffed at least another one on top it was that good
4
Catchup with Emmanuel, Rommel and my two daughters Ashlee and Kirsty over some drinks and light dinner.The microbrewed beers are great, girls had a cocktail and a nice red,Ambiance is nice interesting deco, location close enough to city and the club street eateries to make it but far enough away to be individual and unique We tried the saucy and dry pork ribs both very tasty, we had a range of the starters and we had some fun and interesting company Service was fast and was untroubled Please go and have a loo
5
I first discovered this gem on 1 April 2015 and have been back at least once a month since then. It serves comforting American Southern food, with daily specials on the blackboard. Delicious food, reasonable prices, good vibes and most importantly it provides friendly, attentive and warm service, with the nice manager, John Anthony, at the helm.I was there 3 times in 10 days last month. That speaks for itself on the place 
3
Went there with a group of colleagues. Inside was crowded with no seats but the smell was also strong. We had a meeting that afternoon so decided to sit outside to avoid having BBQ smell on our clothes.We ordered the sandwiches, the pork one, the beef one, the feied chicken one and the lunch special one (cannot recall the name but it was some sausage sandwich).We also ordered potato salad and mac and cheese after.They were busy thus service was a little slow.We were served cold water which tasted oily. The fume or the smell of the kitchen must have gotten into the water.The sandwich was good overall. Though the sandwich looked small, it is enough for a lady's serving.I had the beef sandwich which i find the texture very juicy and yummy.The mac and cheese was a little disappointing. It didnt have much flavor and the cheese didnt give any richness to thre flavour and texture. I was quite suprised.The sandwich did leave a very good impression. Service needs more improvement as we waited long for the service and the bill to arrive (also pastly our fault for wanting a split bill then a single bill in the end)
4
Having enjoyed a previous visit to the original Burnt Ends, I was of course delighted to hear of the opening of a new, smaller outfit. A condensed version, I would say, with a menu of items popular at the original.So I gathered a couple of work friends over lunch earlier this week and paid a visit. I must say, I just had one of my best Mondays.The use of wood and warm dark browns created a cosy vibe upon entrance, perfect for a break away from the regular CBD crowd and noise.Although reviews have previously stated no wait service, I was nevertheless pleasantly surprised to find a wait staff attending to our table and providing helpful suggestions, even taking our orders. While not expecting butler service, this is minimal but impeccably functional.Our orders were also delivered to our table within reasonable time. The roasted chicken was incredibly tender but the winner for me has got to be the barbequed pork ribs! It is hard to find ribs done nicely here in Singapore and happy to say, I have finally found my favourite place for a ribs fix.My appreciation to the team at Meat Smith for the quality serves. I am looking forward to spreading the word and being back with more mouths to feed dinner next, drinks on the menu then. Cheers
2
Ordered meat platter, food was bland. Our entire table did not enjoy it. Not likely to return. Burnt Ends is way much better.
3
Went for early dinner had the meat platter.. They said good for two people but I think it should be for 4 people you get your money worth. Friendly service and great atmosphere....
2
Don't know how they do it...the meat is very tender, but it all tastes the same.
The salads and accompanying stuff is just a waste of time.
5
Loved it. Tried chicken wings, great spices & 2 for $5. Had pulled pork sandwich and pork ribs with nachos with brisket. Like the sodas too. Dessert is smoked ice-cream on cobbler.
3
A nice casual and simple restaurant with wholesome meaty food. Great service. The ribs and smoked chicken were alright. Tender ribs were to-die-for. A decent place to hang out and have a meal and drinks with friends. Music is a bit loud so makes it hard to have a proper conversation.
2
Went here for a wine dinner. The food was very amateurish. Whilst well cooked the seasoning was way overdone and then covered in paprika. It was as if someone thought lets open a bbq restaurant and then read a few books, perfected the cooking of the meat but (v tender especially the brined chicken) but had no sense of flavour. The starters inc the crab and kimchi fried things were almost tasteless. How can one make Kimchi tasteless? Come on you really should lift your game if you want to be on business in 12 months
5
Hubby and I recently heard about Meat Smith and decided to give it a try. Originally from Texas, we know a little about briskets. We split the platter which consists of roasted chicken, pork ribs, beef ribs, and brisket. Comes with a side of potato salad, but they were happy to change it to slaw for us. We were pleasantly surprised on how tender and juicy all the meats were. Have to say that this is the best brisket we've had thus far in Singapore. The Chef knows how to throw down some meat! And a first for us in Singapore, we had to wrap up some of the meat to take home because we couldn't finish it all. We NEVER have leftovers dining in Singapore LOL! Definitely will be going back again
5
Been here 3 times in the past month, and every time it has been amazing. Great food, and great music/vibe. The general manager Tim was very sweet and cute, very attentive made sure we were having a great time. There was also a really cute red head chef working in the kitchen :) . Would recommend Meat Smith to anyone who wants good food and great atmosphere
4
First time at this new restaurant in my street. Dinner tonight with the wife. She was skeptical about the lack of salads - "c'mon, it's a meat place" - but we decided to give it a try (in spite of the lack of salads on the menu).The staff was very friendly and explained the ordering concept and the content of the side dishes well. They were very proud of their bar and cocktail making abilities. Being that I am on a diet (trying to loose a few - well actually a whole bunch - of kilos) I told them cocktails weren't for me but I would have a Fernet-Branca ... if they had ... and they did ... Impressive.The menu was not, by any measure, verbose. That's the way I like it but my wife wants all the details. After some explaining we had a plan. We ordered two (100g) of brisket, three vegi sides and some pig's ear in lettuce. To drink: the afore mentioned Fernet for me along with a pint of Pilsner and a (very large) glass of a Malbec for my wife. The wine was great, the pilsner good, and the Fernet a Fernet.Food quality was excellent: Perfectly smoked meat; crispy pickled jalapenos; very good slaw and a superb (for me) wedding between a Vietnamese salad in a lettuce and a Nebraskan pig's ear. Yummy.The ordering system could use a tune-up. People should make up their mind at the table, THEN go and order. The hole in the wall gets very crowded when people are trying to decode the menu and order at the same time. Also, ordering drinks at the cashiers isn't ideal - drinks should be ordered at the bar. It's a new place - I'm sure they will work it out.Great food - good prices - excellent potential. Have fun!Thanks for the tip Patrica from across the street :

We came here for a team lunch and left fully satisfied and fully full.We started with a special and some chicken wings - the wings looked at pricey at 2 for $5, but they were winged perfection, tasty, large with an amazing seasoning and delicious dipping sauce.As others mentioned, the main courses are perhaps on the small side for an American Restaurant, but they are amazing. We had the Brisket, the Pulled Pork and The Tongue and all were exceptional. in a nice brioche style bun with delicious sides.Next time i feel the need for some good ol' southern cooking with great beer, this is the place i will go to
