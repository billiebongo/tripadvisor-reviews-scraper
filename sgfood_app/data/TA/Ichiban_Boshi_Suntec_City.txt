Long queue but the operations manger handle the waiting customers very well. It's a small restaurant and we have 8. He has arranged the table very quickly for us. The food is delicious with huge variety. Enjoyed our feast there!

Service here is terrible. The waiters are not trained properly, lack basic manners and are moody. The food is is not very good either. I was not satisfied dining here. Its a waste of my time and I won't be back.

Came here for early lunch and managed to beat the crowd. Ordered the ginger sliced black pork and some sushi from the conveyer belt. Food is very good quality. Service is good as well.

Service is really good. Food is fresh, authentic japanese style, ambiance is lovely. Food is served warm, and both of us are served at the same time. Which is really good and fantastic customer service.

A nice Japanese restaurant for a family lunch during weekend to start the year. My son like the sushi a lot and it offer a good spread for parent too.

There are many Ichiban outlets in Singapore but a first for us here as it is claimed to be good for soba! My fav since it is a must-eat whenever I dropped by Japan. It is at basement 1 a circular area of F&B just facing the Fountain of Wealth at Suntec City.We came for early lunch, about 1145 on a Saturday and it was more than 50% filled.All Ichiban Boshi outlets feature a conveyor sushi belt as the center showpiece. You can also see the chefs preparing the sushi too. We skipped this and zoomed into the usual seating. I ordered the soba and mini katsudon set while wifey ordered her usual salmon teriyaki . A short wait of about 15 mins ad the food arrived. The soba indeed taste good while I lament portion can be larger. :> They came with the soba-yu inside a red pot but avoid trying to pour it into your dipping sauce (as instructed). It will spoil the taste totally, diluting it. Instead I just poured out into a cup and took some, it is bland but supposed to be nutritious! The salmon however was not well made, a bit hard (over treated?)I would say this is the better Ichiban Boshi outlet out of the many I have visited. The staff is friendly and always try their best to response fast. Definitely worth a revisit for all the value-set meals. Now especially so for my soba meal

I've been to 3 Ichiban Boshi outlets by now, because the food tastes really great and is good value-for-money, too. Like most places in Singapore this outlet is very clean, sushi are freshly-made and sashimi is even served on ice. Unfortunately they don't have iPads like the one in IMM, so you have to rely on catching your waitress' attention for ordering your next round. Staff is friendly, but a little slow here, so expect to stay for at least an hour. We had a good time

Restaurant was full with guest queuing, male manager handled operation so well none guest looked upset, orders were brought out as expected timing, food was not the best but delicious, staffs were still smiling even though running full house with guest still queuing at 8pm, kudos to male manager

We visited during the rush hour of office workers going for their lunch, but we got a table pretty quickly and impressively didn't wait long for orders to arrive! Staff were polite and quick to attend. We had varieties from salmon tataki, croquettes, ramen, udon to donburi and they were delicious. Prices wise reasonable too by the quantities. Will return..

We always like to eat Japanese food on weekends. Came here without reservation and on last minute notice as well. They were almost full when I called and the staff told me that we can still get a table or 2 upon arrival (although no reservation allowed), which is still good for us! Indeed the table is available for us when we arrived. Service is attentive and I especially like to commend on one elder lady who will take her initiative to talk to the little ones with us. Very personal service. Good food as always. Please keep up the good work Ichiban Boshi. We like the freshness of all the dishes. Recommend for family
