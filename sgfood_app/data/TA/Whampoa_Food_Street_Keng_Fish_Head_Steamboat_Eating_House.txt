We went to the one at Rangoon. The service was good. The fish steamboat and other dishes were all very good. We enjoyed our dinner there.

Whampoa Keng in Balestier Road has very good and tasty Fish Head Steamboat. Other dishes are also equally good.
4
We had the set menu for four. The hotpot was of course excellent. But it was the other dishes that shines. The chicken wings well fried and juicy still. Kang Kong spicy but not too salty. A little expensive overall but good food.

We came here for their famous fish steamboat. The fish was very fresh and the broth was very tasty. We also ordered the prawn roll, famous tofu, fried pork and stir fired vegetables, which were delicious.The service was very fast and the servers were very accommodating too

As I came solo for a quick dinner I just had the fabulous fish porridge with large chunks of succulent fish immersed in a rich fish stock with rice porridge. Accompanied with a piping hot dish of fried vegetable with lots of garlic, where I could savor the aroma of the "wok hay". Normally in a larger group, one would order their famous charcoal heated steam boat. Consistently good. Alan LeongSingapore

Tried 2 outlets (Balestier & Rangoon) within a week. Service at Rangoon is much better and service staff is fast to react to customers. Balestier outlet is much small and sitting capacity is maybe a quarter of Rangoon. Their yam ring is delicious and surprisingly many tables ordered it when I was at Balestier whilst not many get that at Rangoon. There is some MSG in the soup and i get thirsty after dinner. Fish is fresh but steamboat price is expensive; medium size (3-4 pax) is $50. Their prawn roll is the best dishes here. Parking for both outlets is quite a headache though Rangoon is slightly better with some parallel lots nearby.

We went there on 18th June 2017 and we had the Father Day set.It has been a few years since my visit and price has certainly gone up by a lot. The food still tasted same as before and we ate heartily on that day. However it has certainly lost that "identity" of being ordinary people's gourmet which is really its heart and soul.Maybe it is now more catered for tourists than locals. Just a wild guess

The main star attraction is the steam boat fish which we had a garoupa. A red skin fish for my foreign friends. And the steam boat isn't a steamed boat either. It's a round chafing bowl with a tall funnel in the middle like a moat round a tower castle.The fish was very fresh and sweet. The soup was only good after a 20 mins when all the Flavours got sucked in. But I took all the veg and flesh out quick before they got over cooked. That's the main problem with this dish. The Claypot sweet sour chicken was so so but the street toufu with dried shrimp was cooked just right and very delicate. Total bill $80 for 2 with local drinks of barley and chestnut green. I'll come back again but no so soon.

Went to the sister outlet actually at Rangoon read. They pretty much have the same menu. Must order is the pomfret fish steamboat, the soup is flavored with fried sole, plum and other secret ingredient. What came out top was actually the salted egg sotong/squid, it was crispy not oily and the salted egg was coated generously across each piece. Another winner was the street tofu, it silken tofu served in a crab meat sauce, I literally drank the sauce with my rice. Great place for happy gatherings and big groups

We stumbled upon restaurant as looking for dinner in the area where we had our hotel staycation. It was 5.45pm so there was no queue but staff asked if we had reservations which we replied no. Although there were 2 tables unoccupied she said she had to check and asked us to wait. Then she informed that she cud squeeze us in but we had to finish by 7pm, which was fine by us as we wanted to eat and run back to enjoy our hotel room. Initially I wanted to order a steamboat $35+chilli lala $10+prawn paste chix$10 but she uphold us the special for the day roasted chicken with salt/pepper dip $15 . So I said ok. Then she told me it wud be more economical if I ordered the $68++ package which included dessert .. thinking that it was $8 difference I agreed. The dessert was tortoise shell jelly and mango pudding which was ok. The final bill incl rice and napkins came up to $81nett. The soup in charcoal pot was divine and I love the authentic good old taste of dried flat fish (tee poh) in the broth. The waitress would top up broth as the soup dried up which was great. The Sambal lala (clams) was sandy which meant they didn't soak them well enough (kept getting crunchy sand in every bite :( however the Sambal sauce was delicious) .. the roasted chicken was not marinated enough and bland too taste so the salt pepper dip was needed to make it taste better. Overall I enjoyed the soup and will definitely come back for more. Will however skip the rest of the other 2 dishes. PS it is not fine dining so casual restaurant wear is fine.

We got a set dinner with promfret fish around $73.
Thick broth and fresh fish. Nice steamboat but a little pricey.
Prompt service, worth to try.
1
Had dinner there recently. The restaurant has closed half of previous space, standard of food dropped tremendously, perhaps chefs have left for elsewhere.
2
Ever wanted to feel second class ? Wanna be ignored by the service staffs ? Food is average , a bit pricey for the quality of the food. Much better choices around Singapore.
5
Tried this for lunch with my family today and it's awesome! The fish head steamboat was great but the thing that sets this place apart from the other fish head steamboat places is that their other dishes are awesome too! My family loved every dish!
4
Quite good I think reasonable price rent is keep down due to its far flung location . If one cares only about food and not much about ambience this is it .. The fish soup is really v good
4
Very popular Cantonese restaurant and it didn't disappoint. Their promfret steamboat dish is the one not to be missed. The promfret was very fresh and the soup was full of flavour. Their salted egg prawns are awesome as well. Restaurant is always crowded so booking is essential. Will definitely come back again

This is quite a famous fish steamboat restaurant in Singapore. I was told that the boss has 2 wives, each managing one of the branches of the restaurant. The senior wife manages the original restaurant at Balestier Road (554/556, Balestier Road, Singapore 329872. Tel: 63567371), while the younger wife manages the restaurant at Rangoon Road (116/118, Rangoon Road, Singapore 218396. Tel: 62968843).I visited the one at Rangoon Road. It is a simple air-conditioned coffee shop type of restaurant at the corner of the road. The decoration is simple and the staffs are generally friendly and efficient. The signature dish is of course the fishhead steamboat. You have a few choices of different types of fishhead for the steamboat, such as red garoupa and pomfret. The steamboat come in different sizes depending how many people are consuming. The fish meat is of generous size, fresh and tasty. You can top up the soup base for the steamboat as many times as you wish. Besides the signature steamboat, the restaurants also serve other dishes that commonly available in the typical Chinese resaturant. For example, they also serve good prawn paste chicken, prawns rolls, yam ring, crabs (various cooking styles such as curry, yolk and black pepper), pig trotter and claypot pig liver. It is not a fanciful restaurant, but certainly a restaurant with fairly nice, and reasonaly priced food. Good for casual gathering for family and friends

Interior is functional and clean. Reception and service is equally efficient and rarely losing a smile. Putting the bill on the table while we had our meal was a bit original but everybody is allowed a bad day. Food is excellent and recommended. All dishes arrived at proper temperature, textures and well balanced flavours. We enjoyed fish-head steamboat with bardan fish (a must), broccoli with garlic, hei cho (fried prawn roll with pork) and marmite pork ribs. To drink. Try hot or cold barley and wintermelon tea. Will return. Perhaps we can steal smile.

My family went there for dinner last night. 2 adults and 3 kids (aged 5, 7 and 12). We ordered fish steamboat, sweet & sour pork and hotplate tofu. All the food was nice and we enjoyed it very much. For the fish steamboat, the batang fish slices were boneless and suitable for kids. The slices were thick enough. The soup was tasty and we didn't feel thirsty after the dinner. The sweet & sour pork was crispy and balanced in texture. Hard to find nice sweet & sour pork nowadays. As for the hotplate tofu, there was a good mix of egg, tofu, prawn and pork. Delicious too. Thus, would recommend this makan place. And to add, the place is air-conditioned and there's a HDB open car park just 5 mins away

We went to the branch at Rangoon Road. Unfresh crabs led to my 2 friends and me having swollen lips, swollen tongue, stomachache and diarrhoea. We are have never had allergic reactions to any seafood and do consume crabs frequently enough to know what is fresh. So we are certain all the discomforts are from the crabs being not fresh. Drinks were all diluted and desserts were terrible too. The texture of the mango pudding and herbal jelly were wrong. There both also tasteless

I have been in S'pore to try most of the steamboat, this is perfectly satisfied. The soup base are good and don't feel like thirsty. They do have a good claypot chicken and the spicy nyonya hot plate seafood
Must try !!

It was our family's first visit on a Sunday evening, we were lucky to get a table without a reservation. We warmed up to the fish steamboat immediately, this was fired up by charcoal, which makes the dining experience different. The prawn roll hae chor, cereal prawns and pork ribs are equally good. Will definitely visit again

Dish Ordered: French Beans 四季豆, Not bad but cut very thin, definitely not the best, not worth the price paid! Prawn Paste Chicken 虾酱鸡 Extremely Salty, the prawn paste flavour not thick enough.... Tofu 街边豆腐 - Tasted Quite Normal, Still the sauce is salty Prawn Roll Hae Chor - Fragrant, Awesome with Sweet Sauce Bamtang Fish Slice Steamboat - Typical Normal Steamboat, On the average side The verdict: Food are on the salty side, not really healthy. You can definitely find better and cheaper food else where, it's not that I cannot afford it but it is not worth it. Service was average with not enough manpower, But the waiting time was reletively short, kinda 10 mins only so was quite satisfied on this side despite the restaurant being full. Cleanliness is okay but not enough space in the shop, so if your reservation is late, they will put you at a hot and kinda stuffy area though there is air-con. Not really worth the try if you are staying far, 天外天 and the ones at whampoa hawker center are already better than this so called 'restaurant' Please refer to pictures. Thank You

This is a popular restaurant. Frequented by quite a few celebrities, it has created a strong following. They are know for their fresh fish steam boat and you won't be disappointed. One thing that makes them standout is that they use charcoal, which is quite unusual nowadays. Aside from the fish, other side dishes I find average. I personally feel that they are a bit overpriced

Went there on a Saturday night with my family. As usual, the place was packed out and there was a line outside waiting to get in.Luckily, we made a reservation. Reservation is just a short phone call away and this is a MUST DO if you do not want to wait for ages.We ordered our usual dishes and were served very quickly. One thing my family commented at the end of the meal, which I noticed but did not say anything,is that the soup in the steam boat seem to have lost it's "oomph". It somehow does not taste the same. Could be a one off, maybe the Chef has a bad day but if this is an indication of the quality going forward, then this establishment will be taken off the list of our favorite restaurants.This would be a real pity because we really did like the food there, especially the soup in the steamboat. Our conclusion is that we will give it one more shot and if it proves disappointing, then we will have to find somewhere else to have our Fish Head Steamboa

Brought my family for dinner at this well-known place on a Sunday. I'm glad I called ahead and made a reservation. There was a line outside (by the main road!). We decided on the set meal as it seemed to offer better value. We opted for the pomfret steamboat but were told it was sold out (at 7:45pm!), so we settled for the red garoupa instead. We also had the homemade tofu with salted egg, pork ribs, roast chicken and XO asparagus. The servings were generous and the taste was excellent. The service was very good for a casual family-style eatery and the service staff were regularly topping up the broth in the boiler. The pricing is not overly expensive for the quality of food we enjoyed. We had 5 adults and ordered the 6-person set but ended up taking home some pork ribs and chicken which we could not finish. We'll be back quite soon

For a person who doesn't fancy fish...I must say this place serve really good fish soup. The fish is so fresh that there is not slight tinge of fishy smell in the soup. The prawn roll is a must try too. I will come back to this place again.

I don't understand why this shop can be rated delicious and good...I ate there last week and while the soup tastes good when u are drinking it, I have to drink 10x the water after the meal cos there are simply too much MSG added to the soup! Very bad for health, I will not patronize it again

This is my 1st time here on a weekend. Parking is a big headache. Fish head steamboat is great but you can give the crispy chicken a miss. The prawn roll is tasty and maintain the traditional taste. Salted egg crab is much better than the chilli crab. I will be back again to try other dishes.

Try to eat a few times for dinner but always difficult to get a table. Came on Saturday for lunch and walk in without reservation. Had a set for 2 at $68+. Fish steamboat, spiy chicken and tofu special. Food was good. Small mango pudding for dessert was nothing special.
4
Partner brought to this restaurant. Delicious food, nice soup and variety of Chinese dishes.
Food served quite fast even in busy time, but after served a bit delay for continue new order or adding soup. Anyhow, yummy.
4
Good value during lunch time, set lunch only $6 with hot/ cold barley drink. It has a lot of Variety and almost everyone come order for their lunch set.
4
I had chili crab n it was very good than I expected. Bit expensive but think it's reasonable. I may come here again
4
Steamboat was excellent except portion a bit small. Fried prawn paste chicken wing was one of the best I have tried.
Avoid peak hours if u do not have reservation.
4
The broth is rich and flavorful. It is a combination of fish bones and Chinese herbs blended in a secretive ratio. The fish meat is very fresh for the steam boat. The other compliments to the steam boat were just as fresh. This combined forces of fresh ingredients makes it a very delicious and rich soup for the taste bud

This place looks just like all of the other humble little Chinese eating places along almost any shopping street in any Singapore away from Orchard Road or the CBD. One notable difference from its neighbours is the queue outside, although you can reserve a table. Furnishings are as rough and ready as you might expect, the place is crowded and noisy, apart from us there were no other Europeans in sight, and partly because of all this it was great fun (we've done this many times before!). The service was blazingly fast and the feast that followed was excellent, washed down with Tiger beer. It's famous for its steamboat dishes. As we were with family (four of them currently living in Singapore), we chose a "Value Set Meal" for 6 people which cost about S$30 a head and was worth it. I don't remember everything we had, nor their names, but everything was freshly prepared and delicious and there was no room left for anything after we had demolished as much as we could and "da bao"d the rest (take away!). Recommended for those who love good and authentic Chinese home cooking. Get there and go home by taxi - cheap and safe, like everything in Singapore.

This could be a tradition for me. Hahaha. Everytime I go to Singapore I always eat here. And the last time I went to Singapore, I ate here twice in one week. For me, this is the best fish head steamboad in Singapore! Best food here is their Fish Head Steamboat, Fried Squid with Salted Egg Sauce, Fried Chicken with Fish Ball inside the chicken, and so much more! Rate 9/1

We (5 adults) reserved a table at 8.00pm on Thursday and ordered the set meal for 4 pax.Pro :1) Food was excellent and prompt.2) The pig trotter was excellent.3) No 10% service charge.4) You can refuse the peanuts to save on the extra charges.Con :1) Parking can be a problem.2) Service was basic.Will definitely go back again and order other dishes. May be very crowded during weekends and public holidays. Better to reserve a table in advance

Had dinner gathering with group of committee members. Food is good and properly recommended by the staff. Friendly and even allowed us to spend time for round table talk, after dinners and all food and utensils cleared, with provision of drinks. Strongly recommended for dinner and price is definte VALUE for Money

My favourite place for fish steamboat, served in traditional charcoal fired pot. Fish slices are always fresh and the soup broth very tasty and refills available.Great place for a hearty dinner. Their other dishes are also very good. The homemade tofu is very unique with its soft texture.all in all, a great place for a chinese dinner
