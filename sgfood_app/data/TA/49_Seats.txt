Super impressed with the food quality especially the pan fried fish with alscampi sauce. The dory fish was well marinated and it matches very well with the sauce. Will be back to try back dishes!

Upon entering the restaurant, the huge metallic wall wowed us in the most magnificent way. The salted egg tom yum sauce is the best combination i have tried. The cheese fries is also a must order for its generous cheese. Highly recommended !

Chanced upon this restaurant in town and we had a splendid afternoon spent there. Staff recommendation on the creamy duck pasta was honestly one of the best I have eaten for that price range. Cheap and good. The interior is cool too.

We avoided the crowd and made a reservation during lunch time for about 6 of us to celebrate our reunion. We ordered different mains so that we all can share and every dish surpasses our expectation. I personally felt the pan fried fish with alscampi sauce and the creamy smoked duck pasta were the best as I do not take spicy. Great local food not to be missed

Had lunch here because it was highly recommended. Didn't order what was recommended but had two of their must try dishes, Seafood Tom Yum Pasta & Fish & Chips with Tom Yum sauce. The pasta was good but I wouldn't say great. The fish & chips was disappointing mainly because they use the cheap fish that too many places use.May come again to try the smoked duck pasta which was recommended

bad experience with this restaurant. wanted to order nuggets but no nuggets. wanted to order coke float but no ice cream. the waitress decided to just order coke for me which I didn't want. food was average tasting. could have been better. the last straw is the payment method. outside the restaurant, there's signs saying "Cards welcome". However, when I wanted to pay by Visa, the waitress say they do not accept card. Now, if the establishment does not accept cards, make it known to the customers before they order. I would not recommend this restaurant at all.

Being a spicy lover, 49 Seats is famous for their chili hot tom yum pasta. A local twist with western influence. I specially ordered the level 49 tom yam pasta and it is crazily good. But got to warn about those who cant take the heat, you can just enjoy the usual standard plate that is on the menu

I went for lunch with my colleagues. I was the 1st to order over the counter and went back to my seat to discover that there is a roll the wheel to get discount for the meal. They told me that the cashier actually asked the guy behind me to spin the wheel but she did not tell me about this promotion nor my colleagues. They have to ask her and she then said yes. We are a group of girls and we can only derived that it seems only men gets special treatment or the privilege of being informed by the cashier. It is not the discount that matters. It is the bias treatment we faced that left a bad note, unfortunately at the restaurantâ€™s expense due to an untrained or bias staff.

Firstly, kudos to the designer who thought of the super cool metallic wall which makes up the entire ambience that is cosy and chill (which we actually sat there for hours ). Secondly, the food portion is generous and we had our stomach filled to the max. I would highly HIGHLY recommend the Fish and Chips with Alscampi sauce which is probably the best combination I have tried in Singapore. Another dish I would recommend is the Creamy Smoked Duck Pasta as well. I definitely look forward to my next visit to tackle their famous Tom Yum Pasta.

Came here last week with a friend for lunch. We opted for the set which consisted of a soup, a pasta and a soft drink for $15. I opted for the marinara pasta which was tasty enough. The soup wasn't anything special, and it was unfortunate that they only offered sugar-laden softdrinks. In retrospect it might have been better to make use of the 1:1 offer on one of the credit cards and not worry about the drink or the soup
