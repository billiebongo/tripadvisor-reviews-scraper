Very thin & tasty but like an Indian paratha with your choice of filling incorporated into the dough; this pan fried tasty dish is something worth trying. Great snack with a cuppa!

Good range of pratas but oddly priced as an egg prata is double the price of a plain one. Curry is tasty with no MSG aftertaste but those who prefer spicier curry may find their curry on the milder side. Air conditioned place, which is a plus in view of Singapore's weather

The family visit often for the plain paratha served with curry. Available all day, unlike food courts and hawker centres where often it's only served for breakfast.Not so keen on its other curries and samosas are heavy, but the roti rata is always heavenly. A cheap and cheerful glass-walled restaurant. Pay and you'll be given a number written on a piece of plastic. Watch the pratas being thrown and cooked on the huge grill plate whilst you wait for your number to be flashed up on the signboard

My hubby and I ordered 2 sets of 2 plain prata with coffee on 11/11 night time..We were waited almost 20 minutes then I realised the order behind being called while ours not yet... Out of curiosity, I went to approach the counter and was told our order being left out.. It was quite disappointed with the service Overall the experience was not bad except the waiting time..

Was recommended by friends to this prata outlet. Have been a few times as the nearest outlet for prata. Plus Food is average ,won't go crazy over it.If u want to tuck into some prata and Teh tarik then it meets the craving. MinusThe counterstaffs are not that friendly. And get very irritated when u ask too many questions or request for changes. Customer service can be improved. Overall experience can be better if staffs improve their service

Ordered 2 pcs of plain prata, both prata & curry taste good :D Well, they don't only sell prata, there are lots of other dishes too...Service was pretty good. The guy who took order was friendly even though the queue was quite long at that time... As for the price, it's slightly higher but acceptable (plain prata comes in 2pcs for $2.20, other kinds of prata, about $2 per pc)I was there on a Monday around 10-ish & they are open til 12am It's a good choice if you don't wanna settle for fast food all the time :

I always go here whenever I crave for prata , and so far never been disappointed. their cheese Prata is my favorite and you can actually see while it's being done. I am also a fan of their curry and briyani rice. Definitely a must try. Brought many friends here and so far they also liked i

This restaurant is a little box just outside the mall at the Ang Mo Kio MRT Station but it's known for delicious roti prata with plenty of variations.You can have it plain, with egg, with ham, with chicken and even with chocolate. Pair it with your favorite hot or cold drink but I recommend you try their tea tarik to go with your prata.The curry sauce is also delicious: not very spicy and has a nice taste, color and smell. The place is cozy and some regulars go to enjoy their prata while reading a book. Best of all, eating here won't put a strain on your budget whether your a tourist or a worker in Singapore. Service is also very quick and you can even watch the cook prepare the food
