This place is stunning and the food is what you would expect in any top notch bakery anywhere. Just had a breakfast date and am set for the day. It's not really cheap but definitely worth a visit
4
The flat white are comparable to some of the best cafes in Melbourne. Very good pastries (not so good almond croissant) and a very nice place to chill and get out the heat and humidity of Singapore.
5
Enjoyed a perfect flat white and croissant early today. Who would have thought that you would find a croissant perfectly made on Orchard Road!! Would highly recommend
5
Nice and cosy place inside a shopping centre. Good to chill and relax after shopping. Good service and food
5
I first stumbled upon this bakery coffee shop years ago when in need of an Wi-Fi connection. It has since become my to go to coffee in Singapore. Their mushroom & brie croissant is outstanding too, get it heated up slightly and enjoy!

Have visited the bakery in its three locations in Singapore a number of times. The brand is a popular one, and this particular branch along Orchard Road is well-placed. Does the brand live up to the hype? I agree with other reviewers; sincerely feeling that the food offerings are good, but not any more special than in other french bakeries. This said, the almond croissant and the kouign amann are worth a try. Besides, service is friendly
3
with the hype on this bakery, we were slightly disappointed.we had the croissant, considering it's a signature item, but the piece was not as crispy as it should be, average quality.coffee was with a sharp sour taste, not our cup of "coffee".all in all, it's a place where you can have a break after strolling along Orchard Road, yet it's very busy in afternoon
4
We checked this place out on the basis of the sign in the window saying number one bakery in Singapore on TripAdvisor. Being a Saturday it was incredibly congested with lots of people in a very small space. Had a good range of pastries and we had raisin brioches which were pretty good. And it had flat whites. After three months travelling in Europe this is the first flat white I've found so that was a plus - and again, it was pretty good. Efficient staff. All in all a good experience and we'd go back
4
Always lovely to pop into this cozy coffee house in orchard. Love the seating around the perimeter of the shop, it's perfect for two people to sit side by side and have conversation. I always get a hot cuppa with a pastry of some sort. The croissants here are always amazing, flaky, lots of layers that have raised properly and the almond filling always so good. One pastry is usually good for two to share! Love that there's free flow water and other condiments for the pastries. Super fast and friendly service and a good ambiance inside
5
It's been a long time since the last time I went to Singapore. Tiong Bahru Bakery is one of the-go-to list in Singapore. I was so happy to see that they open in the Tangs Orchard! I tried with my mom and niece for breakfast on the day of our departure back home. We ordered their almond croissant, salad (forgot the name) and of course their Pandan Flan! The almond croissant is amazing, the crunchiness of almond the pastry and taste are just great. I love the salad, they have the interesting dressing and so fresh. Last but not least the PANDAN FLAN --- the best flan ever. The consistency of the flan is just right not too hard, not too soft and the taste is heaven!The place is not so big. It is more suitable for a quick breakfast/coffee/lunch and a grab and go type of place. Not suitable to bring kids around as it is too small and might disturb other table.Overall experience is delightful. I will definitely go again when in Singapore
4
Nice little coffee shop with many options of delcios pastry, sandwiches, rolls , pancakes you will get confused on what to order. But they are famous with their almond croissant.
5
Or, in local says, the croissant lagi syok! die-die must try! The coffee also not bad. Very packed during breakfast time, prepare yourself to queue.
5
Still the best croissant in town IMO and surely a great place for breakfast or a quick coffee break. Also try their almond croissant and kouign amann for something sweet.
5
tried their sandwich and taste good, didn't try their croissant though.
the eclair was good also.. located just next to tangs orchard.
4
Went there for brunch. Order their molases bun & scones with latte's. It was good and the coffee is decent. Nice location and I wish can stay a bit longer..
5
Another hidden gem in singapore when they first started at tiong bahru , now opens at orchard rd at ck tang . Must try their koig aman .
5
Everytime i go to singapore this place is a must to visit for brekkie, their croissant!!! Omg!!! Really cant describe from here, u just got to try it your self.
5
Dropped by this little cafe for my coffee break after few hours of shopping. Bought their almond croissants & Kouign Amann - simply heaven of butter! The setup is small in the corner of Tangs. Definitely will come by again if in town. Hoping to try their main branch in future for their full spread of breads & brunch. Pricing wise is considered steep in Malaysian standards but worth it if you are looking for good breads to compliment your caffeine fix.
4
Wow - this place is really popular and that says a lot. Many locals there which also says a lot. A substantial range of bakery and food products. Be prepared to make decisions, pay your money and move along in the queue as quickly as possible
4
I ve always enjoyed getting croissants from Tiong Bahru Bakery and especially the almond croissant at the Tangs branch with coffee. The standard is good and the service warm and friendly. Dont get confused with the other Bakery TIAN Bakery I went to check out the other Tian bakery opposite the Tiong Bahru market (currently undergoing refurbishment) I was attracted by the sign which states they dont use refined sugar and gluten. So I asked the server behind the counter (what sugar they use. She replied refined sugar and honey. I was so surprised as I told her the sign said no refined sugar!At this point it being a hot day I decided to get an ice cream and she obligingly offered I try the flavours. I tried raspberry too sour so I put my stick down on the counter but big mistake as another senior server (or perhaps owner or manager told me officiously to pick up my stick and put it in a container for used sticks (which I had not seen). She could have said it in a nicer way so I retorted thank you for telling me in a nice way!At that time I decided I would not bother about the ice cream. My son remarked she was curt and could have been nicer. My husband said he had ordered three coffees but I said cancel the coffees as I did not feel happy to drink my coffee there with such a rude unpleasant atmosphere. When will owners learn that it comes from the top to serve customers well so they come back instead of being curt and rude!Tiong Bakery staff have always been professional even though they are stressed and busy. perhaps because it is french run and professional!The bakery has not only won awards but trained staff well. Well done
5
Since I plan to visit Singapore, I put Tiong Bahru's croissant in my list as one of must eat at Singapore. And... indeed !! It's the best croissant I ever had. It's crispy even not serving in hot
5
The croissants are the best in town for my opinion , my favourite is almond as well.And baugette sandwiches are good and healthy dont worry to visiting for breakfest
5
This place was excellent! There was a wide variety of pastries which were all really well cooked. The staff were friendly and we ended up coming here quite a few times during our stay! They should open one in London!
4
I heard about this bakery from a friend and found one accidentally on my way to Tangs. I even refused a free chocolate just to save some room for trying this bakery. The coffee was not special but the croissant was another different story. It was crispy on the outer layer but quite soft in the inside. Definitely will come again on my next trip to Singapore
5
Thanks for the welcomed feeling Everytime we visit! Barista knows how to make the perfect Long black and his soy cappuccino is excellent- not too many places can get that right.Thanks Barista man 'shaun' and Alex & Agui for managing the team really well
5
 A must visit local hotspot. And instead of the regular coffee shops go here. Great food, superb cakes and other nibbles and also healthy options. The orchard road outlet has good views of the road. Sit there and sip away and watch the world go by. One of my finest memories of the trip
5
We love passing by here for coffee and a snack. In fact it is often our first stop on orchard! We are always well greeted with friendly staff and they have a great selection of cakes and sandwiches to go alongside good coffee or a fresh juice!
3
I always enjoy the branch at Raffles City. However, my visit to the Tangs Plaza Outlet is disappointing. Croissant was not delightful and satisfying as Raffles City Branch sadly. I was quite disappointed. Service was still good but the food and drinks quality seem to have dropped
4
Have a plan to visit all Tiong Bahru braches in the city during my 6-day visit. I was at their main branch in Eng Hoon St yesterday, went to Raffles City last night only to find out its under renovation and this morning, had my coffee and croissants over Tang Plaza. I commend their consistency in food quality and service. Enjoyed their savory croissant with chicken sausage, flaky almond croissant and my large cappuccino. Service was fast, courteous and helpful. Tiong Bahru in Tang Plaza is at the end of the mall block - literally at the end of the building, which is one short cross-of-the-street away from the next mall Lucky Plaza
5
My friend ans I visited the shop to find out if the place is as amazing as tripadvisor suggests. We tried their Orchard branch in Tang. We enjoyed every bite of its bread / croissant. They offer not a cheap product, their price ranges between 6-11sgd. But it is worth every penny.Despite the food, the staff in the store is also friendly and informative. They open from 8am.. I suggest to visit the store in the morning so you have plenty of choice.
5
Went here two mornings in a row since it was right by hotel. So good. Coffee was pretty and tasty. Everything we got to eat was so good. Much cheaper than hotel breakfast
5
been here multiple times, and I love their croissants. Eat them fresh with a cup of coffee. This place is worth visiting just for that!
5
Just delicious! We went there after reading some reviews and it was exceptional. Their croissants are yummy and the spot is cozy. Don't miss it for any reason!
5
Would highly recommend the savoury croissants and lemon tarts. Very modern interior and fantastic staff. Will definitely return in the future.
5
This was the best coffee we had in Singapore and good by any standard. The staff were also very friendly and helpfully provided advice on directions around town. We went back the next day as it was so good.
3
The oils left a huge stain in the takeaway bag! It was dry and flaky. Definitely not the fluffy french crossaint i am looking forward to!
5
I stayed in Hotel 81 Osaka which is near the restaurant, just 3 minutes walk.
Always went there for breakfast. Open at 8AM, people already waited in front of the cafe. The waitress are very nice.
5
Their specialities are croissant, which are really good. Tried their special croissant savory which include minced pork and some include salmon, those combos are excellent.Traditional simple croissant and almond croissant is not to be miss as well. Croque manseur is very good.. Overall the food are excellent however the small cramps space is the hurdle part. But you can buy it for to go.
5
I happened upon this bakery while staying in a nearby hotel. Wow, what a treat! Delicious pear and pecan pastry, ham/gruyere croissant, lemon tart (level 3 zestiness lived up to its name) and a cappuccino...yes my eyes were a bit bigger than my stomach but everything was so amazingly delicious! Only wish I had time to make a return visit during my trip to Singapore. In the same vicinity as the Tiong Bahru Food Stalls
4
Recently I received an email about 1-for-1 promotion for certain tarts and loaf cakes at the bakery and decided to visit the orchard outlet as it was nearest to me. There were also 2 more outlets, one in Tiong Bahru and another in Raffles City Shopping Centre.The outlet was located in the first floor of Tangs department store. The place was crowded during lunchtime, but the queue moved quickly. I was able to redeem the promotion smoothly and swiftly. Food was already placed on the table before I came back from the cashier. Such fast service.Lemon Tart ($6.50)There was 3 different levels of sourness for lemon tart. I had selected the lowest which was first level. It was slightly sour. The texture reminded one of Jello. The crust was too hard.Pandan Flan ($6.50)It reminded one of a certain kueh, not the kind of traditional flan which I was expecting. A bit too jelat after a few mouthful. Best share with someone else.Latte ($5.50)It tasted slightly chocolaty.Overall food was average. Service was great. There was free wifi from the department store too. Great choice for a place to rest after shopping
5
An enviroment very cozy and comfort especially at tiong bahru heritage building. Cereal bun and baquet with ham verry yummy. I always come this place if I came here.
5
This bakery is a really great place for having breakfast or a break during the day. There are a plenty of choices (sweet & tasty) and i'm sure, you will find something. It's self-service and you can choose between sitting inside (air-con) or outside.
3
Tried their pastries on the first.
Tried the herb baked chicken sandwich on second.
Not too bad in terms of filling and taste.
5
croissant spot on
pain au chocolat spot on
baguette beurre jambon spot on
flat white/magic spot on
as i said before SPOT ON
4
Charming cafe right in the heart of TB. This place seems to be always crowded. Lovely selection of sandwiches and cool cakes (see attached pictures). Will definitely go again.
4
After my first review I went back to branch countless times. I would says for Flat White I had a preferred barista though. Most of the time my coffees were excellent in terms of aroma, acidity, body and aftertaste. Today my regular barista wasn't there. My coffee level only "Good" due to imbalance between espresso shot and microfoam. The pastries were just Excellent as usual. All staffs were attentive and friendly.
4
I was in Singapore for work and had some time to kill in the Orchard area so I decided to check out Tiong Bahru Bakery. I had heard a lot about it from friends so I figured it was worth a visit. The place itself is a bit small for the crowd that comes through here but I didn't have a problem finding a seat. I had a piccolo with a croissant. The piccolo was quite strong, almost like having a macchiato. The croissant was nice and flaky, the way a croissant should be. Flavor-wise it had enough buttery taste without being overwhelming. I bought some regular and almond croissants to take home and share with friends. They liked the stuff too. In addition to croissants of all kinds Tiong Bahru Bakery has a range of sandwiches on display as well. Definitely seems like a place I will be visiting again on my next trip to Singapore
2
Honestly the quality of products is good. Taste of some products has been adapted to the Asian preference as well as the assortment. The croissants are very good but a bit sweet. Many good products are sold and staff is generally friendly.For the Tangs outlet I am just very dissapointed that they should be called a bakery but a cake cafÃ©. Baguettes in the morning are hardly available. I have been a few times recently to buy baguette and croissant in the morning (weekends 8-9am) but always the baguette is unavailable. Sales staff told me that they only receive 2 baguettes (!!!) each morning for sale at the Tangs outlet. In the meanwhile I have discover a much better alternative which is Maison Keyser (Schotts Square) they have remained a truly French bakery with all the classic products like baguettes and croissants. It seems that since the famous Chef (Gontran Cherrier) has left the Tiong Bakery that it is becoming a more local style cake shop with sweet bread products. Nothing wrong with a change of strategy but is does not meet my expectation of high quality French bread products. Sweet breads can also be bought from BreadTalk and many other local shops in Singapore. Sorry but no baguette = no bakery.
4
great location .. at the corner of Tang Plazaquite packed area and worthed to enjoy selection of pastry-bakerycoffee was greatthe placea mostly busy of the time.. but a good ambiente mix local and tourist round the worlda great stop definitely in orchard busys are
5
We were staying the Nostalgia just around the corner. Asked at the reception if their was a local bakery and were directed here........ what a find, a queue outside left our name didn't have to wait long ( worth the wait were we in for a treat ) Coffee smelt great but I like Tea on a morning and it was a great cuppa. In the line I'm looking at all this fantastic fresh food, sandwiches,croissants,pastries cakes. We were choosing for the day and picking what we would have tomorrow. If your not in the area I would take a taxi here. Everything was 100% certainly set us up for a day sightseeing in Singapor
4
I would say it is one of the best Croissant in town. They pastry is good too. Best time to go is during breakfast or brunch, cause they do have promo ie: buy one pastry free one coffee or tea.
4
Through jet-lag I am to early for hitting the Orchard Road jobs. Thanks God for remembering TIONGS BAKERY, next to Tangs Department store! Best coffee and good Croissants etc. Worth while to go there!
5
We found this bakery by accident but it was a great find. They serve very nice breakfast food - sandwiches, fresh baguettes including a squid ink one which is amazing. The coffee is also very good.
One thing - no wifi which is a shame!
4
Great place to stop by - early morning, afternoon or early evening. Coffee barista's are on the ball, cakes are interesting and freshly made. A little small for sitting and having a quiet chat but if you prefer a hint of hustle and bustle with your caffeine this is the place to go.
5
Our search for a great coffee in Singapore stopped here! My partners double shot flat white (apparently all there coffees are double shots!) was brilliant and my cappuccino was the best of any on a recent trip to Asia. The Manager Christopher Savrimuthu was very happy with our feedback and very proud of his baristas...top notch! His coffee roaster so he told us was Australian, so full marks. It's situated on the corner of Tangs department store
5
The smell alone is bound to make you hungry. Everything in this place is superb! They boast of the best Kuoign Amman in town, but my personal favorite was the earl grey scones. Most people who ordered went for the croissants. I liked everything I tried here. Even the coffee is good
5
Busy place packed with customers and lots of to go orders also. Coffee is made in perfection with a beautiful heart!!! Breads were so fresh and baguettes are crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. Great sandwiches and all kinds of pastry. Friendly waiters and staff. Best Squid Ink Baguette I have even tasted! They even wrap up my Squid Ink Baguette in cling wrap so I can take it on the plane. Two thumbs up!!!! Love to visit this place again in the future
4
Most pastries are good here but u must try their Kouign Amman $3.50, which is extremely crispy, tasty & rich! I usually buy at least 3 to bring home as u get a stamp for every $10. After 5 stamps, u get free croissant, coffee, or Kouign Amman
5
We visited this bakery shop today. The Skinny Hot Latte was excellent. Croissant was excellent with lots and lots of layers as it supposed to be. All staffs were very attentive and friendly. We been to original branch in Tiong Bahru before and this branch is even better in term of quality of pastries, coffees, space, cleanliness and services. Locate conveniently right in front of TANG Plaza shopping mall.
5
Best pastry you could ask for when you are hungry for a sweet breakfast (actually they also serve savoury but I hadn't time to try everything). Coofee and cappuccino are good (Italian standard) and the service is fast. Nice location in Tiong Bahru, haven't tried the one in Orchard Rd
4
Very good food served in a spotlessly clean restaurant. Staff was very helpful. Prices were high - but typical for Singapore tourist areas. Worth every dollar!
4
This bakery has good coffee and very good pastries. The chocolate almond croissants are delicious and the orange cranberry pastries are excellent.
4
Good coffee. Great pastries. I usually have the croissant which Is their specialty. The seating area is convenient but a little cramped as it sits next to tangs. Very prompt service compared to other places
4
Great Pastries and Coffee. Very clean premises. Staff were very friendly and very helpful with suggestions on doing and seeing local attractions.
5
Found this bakery whilst walking from Hotel Nostalgia. Was always crowded with a wide cross-section of ages, local, expats & tourists. Loved the baguettes, pastries, coffee & British Breakfast tea.
4
A good atmosphere is provided at here,the food is also good.I had a curry burger here,it cost 9.00$ and it's tasty,but it's not my cup of tea.....
5
My Wife had visited the Tiong Bahru cafe and loved it. Similarly this one has very tasty croissants and interesting selection of sandwiches and pastries, eg green tea almond croissant and squid ink sandwich. Clever and popular. Will be back!
4
One of th finest restaurants to visit inside Tang's super department store on Orchard Rd. excellent choices of snacks available... Also voted one of the best restaurants in SIN.
5
The Tiong Bahru Bakery at Tang Plaza is a great alternative to hotel breakfast. They have the best croissants in Singapore, possibly better than those available in many pÃ¢tisserie in Paris! The Kouign Aman are worth a detour. Their coffees and savoury sandwiches are also quite good
4
Staff is always very friendly. Basicly there 2 options in Singapore (Orchard area): Maison Kayser or Tiong Bahru Bakery. To my opinion baguette is best at Maison Kayser and croissant/pain au chocolat and sandwiches are best at Tiong Bahru.Only negative comment is that Tiong Bahru opens at 8am but strange enough the baguettes are difficult to get before 10am. Whereas to my taste bread&croissant are the basics of a French bakery for early breakfast. Cakes & sandwiches can come around 10am.This morning at 9am .., no baguette, according to the friendly sales lady this would only come in at 10am. This is not acceptable for me and reason to go to Maison Keyser next time again.
3
Ordered Cafe Mocha and their Parisian dessert. It was just so so. Overpriced for sure. It doesn't offer anything new.
5
Such a great place to sit and enjoy the choices of bread and croissants and coffee. Simply delicious with many varieties in a quaint surrounding. Who needs to go to Paris when you have this?
5
I ate there twice on my holiday vacation .. my son Love the danish so much spec for kough aman ... always be my list when i visited singapore ciao till next time
5
Nothing to not like. Great food and ambience. Great outdoor seating in european style. Bit crowded on sunday morning, but families come in for sunday breakfast or brunch
5
The Breton pastries were outstanding, and the apple ones were the best of them all. Do try the Nile Nymph tea for a great breakfast round out. This is one of the best bakeries have been in anywhere on the globe, and well worth a stop to try out what they have
4
This is the smallest of the 3 Tiong Bahru Bakeries, but I do enjoy sitting at the window, enjoying my coffee and quiche and people watch. The Kouign Amann here is fantastic, I don't think any other bakery has done anything close to this at all. You must try the original Kouign Amman, the other flavours are just so-so. Lemon tart is really good, I like that it was tart enough for me, and no overly sweet. Service wise, this outlet has the BEST service among the three outlets (Raffles City has the worst service)
5
Popped in here before starting the tiong bahru heritage trail on the recommendation of a friend.It's very nice! Good food, especially the savouries and our quiche & sandwich were fantastic. Cakes were not bad but not as nice as just a simple ham baguette!Coffee was good too, very solid flat white and they do nice tea.Staff were super busy - the place was heaving on Sunday morning - but polite and friendly when you caught their eye.Overall it's recommended if you are exploring Tiong Bahru
5
When you're standing in line to order next to a french woman struggling with her English you know the croissants are gonna be good. I loved this place. Crowed and noisy but everywhere in Singapore is crowded and noisy. Coffee is superb. The quiche is exceptional
5
Their croissant is awesome!! Best one I've tasted.I also tried their squid ink - smoked salmon sandwich. The lemon tart is sour, just the way I like it. The coffee doesn't disappoint too. I always order the flat white. My trip to Singapore wouldn't be complete without a trip to this coffee sho
4
Rated as best croissants by Sunday times,so I thought I should try. And it was actually a satisfaction guarantee bakery shop. Nice latte to be added. Went there alone during my business trip to Singapore, surprisingly eating alone in this bakery shop Wasn't awkward at all, friendly staff aswell
4
This place has the yummiest croissants I've ever come across , surpassing the ones I've had in Paris. A nice place to chill-out after shopping in tangs !
4
Went to the outlet near ck tang mall orchard
They are famous for their croissants and coffee. The crossaints very popular and runs out fast
The cafe is always full but can wait for the experience and wonderful crossaints
4
The title says it all, if you love croissants as much as I do, go here! Would recommend the other selections as well but unless you're really hungry I'd stick to the the Danish; the paninis are humongous.
5
This became my favourite stop for a morning coffee and croissant during my week in Singapore. Coffee was consistently good, the service was great, and the chocolate almond croissants....oh my! I will have a special place in my heart for them- delicious!
3
Let me start by saying that I grew up within walking distance of a small town French Patisserie. Freshness is critical for first rate pastries. We went to Tangs Tiong Bahru on a Monday morning. We ordered three plain croissants, one almond croissant, vanilla millefeuille, chocolate kue Aman, mixed berry tart, long black coffee and a regular cappuccino. The coffees were very good. The pastries were all a disappointment especially after reading so many glowing reviews. I would rate all pastries as average and have that mass produced quality about them. Yes, the vanilla millefeuille looks unique, but the pastry itself is not what real millefeuille should be like. I'm guessing our croissants were made the previous day. For the quality served, prices are too high. Service was efficient but not notably friendly. I won't be going back
5
I like the breakfast set which you get to choose from i think 4 different pastries and a drink (Coffee and Tea) I always get the Original Kouign Amann and a Cappuccino (The original tastes better than the apple flavour - with butter and their jam)One of our favourite breakfast and coffee spots. M&M
4
This cosy coffee place is at the corner of Tangs Orchard nearer to Lucky Plaza. It is a great place to grab coffee and pastries or desserts, and at the same time people watch especially when you sit by the windows. Highly recommend their crossiants. It can get crowded during weekends :
4
Was referred here by a French friend so can't argue with the authenticity of the recipe. The croissants were super. Kouign Amman lived up to the reputation I had read online. Millefielle (sp) wasn't quite as I had hoped though still good.The Orchard location want crazy busy when i was there just after lunch hour but can see how it would get very busy. I see some reports online that the location is overhyped but for me it was about as expected. Wouldn't hesitate to recommend to anyone downtown or near any of their other locations.
5
The bakery is rather small and hidden at the Orchard Rd. They serve varied choices of bread, pastries, cake, as well as sandwiches. The food are really good. The choices of coffee and tea are okay but not outstanding. The ambiance in the cafe is very nice. Very very recommended for grabbing breakfast/lunch or just resting after a long day shopping at Orchard Rd
3
This coffee shop is at the corner of Tangs department store (Near lucky plaza) I found this coffee shop is always busy. So today I walked in to explore their secret of popularity!The problem is... the small shop is packed with ppl , I could barely walk through to the counter. I didn't feel like having a coffee here and I decided to leave. At the time, two ppl who sat next the entrance got up! I was finally seated by luck.The various pastries displayed look pretty good. I ordered a cappuccino with an almond pastry. The coffee was very nice, got a rich flavor and steam milk was just right. The almond pastry was not too bad. I don't think I would come again unless I do take away. It is very difficult to find a coffee shop that is quiet and make a nice coffee in Singapore. Plz let me know if you find any T_T
