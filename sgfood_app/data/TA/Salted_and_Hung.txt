Delicious dishes and wonderful Chef with a good kitchen and service team. Food were spot on in taste and textures and flavours. Will be back

The food and service here could not be faulted. Every dish was balanced in flavour and rich in char grilled smokiness. Service was exceptional, with every dish being explained and excellent recommendations made. There was also a sense of genuine warmth, casualness and friendliness. Not the healthiest of cuisines with its grease and char, but what a great occasional treat.

I'd called in here, two doors from my modest hotel, for a quick beer about five in the afternoon. The staff were lovely then. I returned to dine on Christmas Eve and was recognised and welcome back. OK, a white haired Caucasian woman does stand out a bit in Singapore, but that welcome was genuine.The menu is quite compact, carefully planned and definitely quirky with the chef/owner's own skills.I ordered waygu steak with garlic stems, lemon a poached pear with rosemary icecream and ginger syrup with a bottle of McLaren Vale Cabernet Sauvignon. It was expensive, but it was absolutely delicious, beautifully presented and served with care and great warmth.

My wife and I toyed with the idea of going for their Festive "Feed Me" menu, but decided not to... cos we reckoned we won't be able to finish all those food. It was a good choice in hindsight, as what we ordered fed us to the brim! Right off the bat, some Prosecco at 'happy hour' rates. We enjoyed a starter of uni & caviar - oh my, what a lovely combo - a lovely start to a very good dinner! Then, their house special charcuterie platter. One does not walk into a restaurant called "Salted & Hung" and not eat their house-cured food! And boy, their charcuterie does not disappoint. The strips of cured fats came with a lemony lift and actually goes quite well with the Sauvignon Blanc we were drinking by then. The pieces of special crisps that came with the platter goes particularly well with the fats (as recommended by the staff).The pork pate and duck prosciutto were lovely. The shaved cured beef shoulder was nice but a little too salty for me. And finally, the sausage will equally good. Overall, a very enjoyable charcuterie platter that I recommend. We ordered 2 main (hamachi cheek & pork shoulder) and a side of brussel sprouts. Both mains were grilled perfectly, and oh so fragrant and enjoyable. But, the brussel sprouts stole the show, as it was cooked perfectly. We were so full by the time we finished the main, but we needed to at least try 1 dessert, so we went for the Pavlova. Boom! Brilliant! Very light and very tasty, the way it should be. A well-made picolo latte gave a nice finish to what was a wonderful meal. Service was very good. The 2 main floor staff took time to explain the food, and make small talk. They interacted well, knew their stuff, and service professionally and with warmth. The wine list and spirits/cocktail menu were decent, with some interesting choices. Pricing was ok for the level of restaurant this is. Overall, a very good dining experience. Highly recommended. Must go, if you have the AMEX 'love dining' promotion to use! ;

I only visited because i had a $10 chope voucher, but unfortunately could not use it for the lunch set, so i endex up spending a bomb, and the food was not memorable nor worth it for the price. Only saving grace was the good servic

A good dining experience overall. Staff was fine if forgettable but the real star is the chef and his exacting standards: great dishes built from high quality ingredients, creative but readable plates, very good wine list and overall a truly enjoyable evening. A few things to tweak, including the arduous task of finding somewhat sharper wait staff but overall a very good spot. We’ll return for sure.

We had the squid, black mashed potatoes, the pork collar and the fish. All of it were really interesting and delicious. Waiting time wasn't that long and the ambience was somewhat pleasant and comfortable. Service however was kinda lacking ; considering the price, I would have expected the service level to be of a considerable high standard. Hopefully the next time I'm back the service level will not be the same, and to be better

Was hosted to lunch here this week. Interesting dining experience. At the suggestion of the waiter, we picked the Charcuterie (which was essentially a selection of cold cuts, all cured in-house) as an appetizer. This was quite quaint and taste was good but a little on the salty side. Instead of a main course each, we elected to share a selection if "small plates" as defined in the menu. We ordered the Bone Marrow, the Kangaroo and the Squid. Of the 3, the I liked the Bone Marrow best and was served up in a visually aesthetic manner (pity I did not take a picture). But the other 2 dishes were presented well too. The Kangaroo dish would not be for everyone as the meat was served raw but I found it all right. The squid was delicious. We also ordered the Brussel Sprouts which was done very nicely and I enjoyed it very much.
4
I had a business lunch at Salted and Hung on a weekday. The crowd was quite casual (less of a business lunch venue and more casual dining). We had the set lunches - I had the tuna tartare and the beef cheek which were quite good value. Service was a bit on the slow side - they look a bit light re staff. Overall - pretty good although I had expected better. I may try the weekend brunch to have a chance to other things on the menu.
4
wanting to the lick the plates. It was that delicious. We went on a public holiday so the Amex one-for-one main meal wasn’t available. Given that the place wasn’t crowded, having the the promotion would have helped. We were a party of 4, and we ordered just about all the items in the menu since it was not a lengthy menu. Sometimes having a few items and doing it well is more important. I must say without the promotion, the food was a tat expensive. And the wine price was expensive. Despite the price, we all enjoyed ourselves. My friends and I don’t mind paying for good food, But if they get their pricing right, they can attract a bigger crow
3
I booked this restaurant having seen a rave review about it. We found it very expensive and pleasant but would not go again.
4
WOUld love to come back here try another food of the menu! Food was amazing! Especially the beef! So tender!
4
Quality and taste of food was legitimately good, albeit on the slightly pricey side. Good for the occasional lunch but not smth to hit up more than once a week
5
Nothing much to say except that I can't wait to go back! Thanks Drew and Scott for the wonderful journey. May there be many more!

Had the journey of a decade menu on sept 20th. What stood out were the beef tongue, red cabbage, pork tenderloin, and most definitely - the peanut butter and jelly. Loved it.
1
For a restaurant focusing on charcuterie, it sure doesn’t live up to its namesake. The saucisson lacked flavour and the cured meat lacked that concentrated meatiness.It seems like salted and hung places a huge emphasis on lard and lardon, which seemed more like a gimmick that anything decadent. Seafood was terrible, with the XL clams swimming in butter. Managed to taste fishy and uninspiring, without any sweetness you usually find a clam. Tased more like a terrible oyster. The kangaroo was uninspiringly gamey, but a decent attempt.On a side note, the hamachi collar was decent and corn with manchego was aight (could have done with a manchego benchamel rather than just melting it on top)
2
I had high expectations for Salted and Hung but was disappointed - seems to want to be a cross between Burnt Ends and Cheeky-by-Jowl and doesn't really get there. Food was ok but not amazing. Portions were small and we ended up having to order extra bread and an extra desert in order to try to fill up.Service was unbelievably slow (even by Singapore standards) - we had the five course tasting menu which we ordered at 8.15 and finished at 11 ... Five small courses in nearly three hours! Also, they insist on keeping your wine elsewhere but you had to wait 15 mins for a refill.Overall, not worth the money (or time)
5
This was my 3rd visit (& counting) to S&H.Food was great as always - had my favourites (tripe, yuzu squid, beef tongue, black mash & corn) and loved every bite.It was the first time we tried desert here & loved it too.Service was nice & friendly to
4
I had a great casual lunch at Salted and Hung, the food was creative, fresh and good value. The front of house was very friendly and we had the chance to talk to the chef been eating at the bar in front the open kitchen. Drew is a great Chef
3
Bought some vouchers during the chope flash sale and was told I can’t use them for lunch sets. Service can be better - more knowledgeable and attentive. Food is pretty decent but beers from alacarte menu is very pricey (paid 18++ for 1 can of Australian beer)
5
My third visit and the food was awesome as usual. Chatted with the friendly chef about the name of his restaurant and will be back again for more good food.
5
Was our second visit in 3 weeks. Didn't disappoint! The wines went well with the food. Loved the tripe , tartare and tongue!
3
Poor ventilation
Waited 45 mins for food
Value only w Amex palate discount
Roast chicken great , steak average
3
Has the flank, iberico pork, kangaroo, scallops, pork belly. Overall everything was ok - but most dishes came swimming in all. Not sure if that's what it's meant to be but it sure got gelat after awhile.
4
I must say that the evening started out poorly with confusion over how many people we booked for (2 adult +1 child which it was argued was a booking for 2 and not for 3). Once seated, the fans were blowing strongly on our heads and we were told that nothing could be done about this and we really considered leaving. We decided to stay and try to eat (despite the windy fans) and we were extremely surprised and pleased by all the food. The quality of every dish was excellent, and I do not say this lightly! Tuna tartare, 2 kinds of pork perfectly cooked, various vegetables, dessert and an original cocktail of smoked whisky with maple syrup. The staff seemed excited to be serving this food, as they should be! I will go back again and maybe request a table under the fans

Salted & Hung is a relatively new addition to Purvis Street - littered with amazing restaurants like Gunther's and Garibaldi - and it is certainly up to par with its neighbors.First and foremost, the food; we had ordered the mackerel, hamachi collar, lamb, and black mash. The photogenic plates were packed full of flavor and each one was so carefully curated in terms of taste, texture, and color. They were really innovative, with really interesting methods of processing the meats, the type of pairings, or the kind of flavors. I highly recommend the mackerel, hamachi collar, and the black mash. The lamb was still really good, but failed to stand out amongst the other dishes. We were given a complimentary "Anzac Bikkie" each, which was a really interesting cookie.Service was great; the servers were really friendly and approachable, and also very polite.My only criticism would be on the interiors. It's still a nice space, but it certainly could've been elevated with furniture that were more plush like large upholstered chairs with white table cloths, which would give an interesting contrast/layering with the slightly industrial/lofty vibes.All in all, I dare say this is the best Australian restaurant in Singapore. Many of the other Australian restaurants here tend to fall short on service, don't make up for it with the quality of their food, and has terrible value. Salted & Hung is the complete opposite of all that, with unpretentious and friendly service, great food, and great bang for your buck
5
we had the tasting menu , which was $75 ++. great selection. My favorite was carabinero prawns , very yummy .Love the westholme flank. the dessert was really good as well. there were 2 chocolate mascarpone and coffe and pavlova nasturtium and blood orange. I would def go back again
5
We went to the Sunday Brunch yesterday and it was the most amazing experience. There is a small buffet of antipasti and charcuterie (small but mighty - definitely don't give it a miss). Then you just order small or large plates as you fancy. We paced ourselves and ordered 1 or 2 at a time, which was perfect. The food is sensational, you can tell how much time and care goes into each aspect of the dish. We loved the combinations of flavours in each dish as well, pickled and sweet components to compliment the richness of the wonderful meats. The desserts too were perfectly sized and gorgeous. I love this approach to 'buffet' dining, it's just perfect! I should also note, we had the free-flow wine and prosecco (beer is also available), and the selections were fantastic. Will definitely be back

I just spent my birthday eating at this establishment and I really love the food there. We had the bone marrow and squid for starters and it was really good. The squid is a must order. I had the wagyu beef ribs for mains which was fatty and juicy, while my partner had the lamb. The lamb was tasty but a bit dry. We also had the black mash potato. It was very smooth but slightly salty. The service was excellent and I had a complimentary dessert because it was my birthday. Overall, great place to have a meal.
4
I made reservations in expectation of dinner with my friend but she wasn't hungry. So we had drinks and finger good. Drinks at happy hour priced at $10 per glass of red wine wasn't cheap ($8 would be). For finger food, we had white bait and the portobello mushroom. They were really good. I wanted to try the main dishes as they were deliciously described in the menu but my friend wasn't hungry. Sigh. May be the next tim

Very nice experience although the portion is small. Good service and food is nice. Set is decently priced although portion is small.
4
Taste and textures were spot on that evening. All thanks to the team at @saltedandhung . It brought me back to aussieland, and even though I've just been back for merely a month, am already missing Sydney.
.
5
The bacon chop and French toast doughnuts are a must have when you visit. The Sunday brunch is good value for money.
5
From the ambience, to the service, to the open kitchen experience, to the food. Amazing experience! Of course the Amex Palate discount helped :) thank you Salted and Hung for the amazing dinner
4
Came here for the set lunch today. 3 (fairly small) courses for $20++. Quite tasty food and efficient service. Worth another visit.
5
My mum and I had the lunch sets. They had run out of asparagus for the appetiser but the roasted brussel sprouts were excellent, and so was the lamb shoulder with picked sauce. Certainly worth the $25++!
5
The ribeye is fantastic and not small.
The squid and the truffle with confit eggs and coppa are my favourite... very tasty.
Well done chef on bringing new flavours in town!

Having lived in Singapore for 3 years, we have been to a great number of Sunday Brunches and can safely say this was the best so far. The standard of the cooking is exemplary and significantly more creative than at the big hotel brunches, which are roughly double the price. We tried all 9 dishes and 3 deserts on offer and would struggle to make any specific recommendations as they were all great. Even though I usually have a strong preference for Champagne, the Prosecco was actually very good and for all in price of $88++ including 2 hours of free flow, we left feeling like we had robbed them blind. A big hotel Champagne Brunch is a quintessential Singapore experience but if you've already ticked that box and just want to go somewhere that serves amazing food, this is the place. We will be heading back to try their dinner menu soon
5
Went on the launch of the new Brunch concept. Liked the way that the menu was free flow in terms of main dishes and desserts.. bit of work on the appetizer bar and it should be a real winnerBest bit is that kids can try different foods and order those that they loved.. Service was bit hit and miss but think that it was more the fact it was the first time and that they were so busy..Drew is great and makes the effort to come and interact with guestsWill be back when I have an opportunity

It's interesting to find a local restaurant which cures it's own meats, something it does with commendable results. The rillete is good as is the steak. Also good is the trout appetiser and the complimentary cookie at the end of the meal is a nice touch. Service staff are knowledgeable and able to make good recommendations. Would have rated it higher but for the slightly high prices.
4
Food is excellent! Although we found the portions for the appetizers a little too small; it makes a good meal if you're a light eater.
5
One of the best value brunch buffets around. A la carte and made to order, it's a blow-by-blow of quality grub. My advice is to pace yourself and share everything. If you're in the boozy mood, it's just $30 to for 2-hours free-flow.
5
Our group of 5 had a fabulous time on a Saturday afternoon. We had the brunch and the food was soooooo good. We ordered second and third portions too. It was a wonderful weekend well spent. Kudos to the chefs and service staff.
5
Never knew lard had such a taste !! Interesting place with unique menu items . Definitely worth a try !
5
Every item in the tasting menu was exquisite - and mostly carb free!! The house mage sausage was delicious and to be highly recommended.
5
Had an amazing meal and experience. Be sure to sit at the counter by the kitchen and see what the talented team are doing. All dishes were so tasty and just the right size. Totally recommend this restaurant, I will be going back for sure!
5
As an alternative to Singapore's famous hotel brunches check out Salted & Hung's fantastic weekend brunch offer. We enjoyed countless plates of tasty morsels, crostini with a creamy halibut and caviar sauce, toast with mushrooms and eggs, crispy fried chicken thighs and fried potatoes with egg to name a few. Food was $58++ for as much as you could eat, and we added $30++ each for free flow prosecco. A perfect weekend treat.
5
We went for the weekend brunch menu. All the dishes we tried were delicious and well sized so you could get more of your favorites. A really fun day out with a group of friends and compared to hotel brunches so much better value for money.

Booked a table for 2 for my anniversary with my gf. Food (4/5):Appetizer: CharcuterieInteresting choice if you want to experience something uniquely Aussie. Not really a fan of cured meats because the ones I had eaten before were dry and salty. The cured loin was done just right. Terrine tasted as good as the ones I ate in Australia. The duck lard, which had a tangy flavor, went well with the biscuits. Wasn't too impressed with the red wine salami. (3/5)Main course: Iberico Pork CollarTasty, juicy and tender. Seasoning could have been more consistent. Most of the flavor was in the fatty part of the meat (yum!) however the lean part was a little tasteless. (4/5)Wagyu beef steakPerfect temperature (medium rare). Tender and juicy. But a little too salty for my liking. I felt the homemade XO sauce on the side was unnecessary. The meat was tasty on its own. (3/5)Dessert:Pavlova (anniversary dessert on the house!)Beautiful presentation. Pavlova was slightly burned but c'mon it's free, no need to nitpick. Ice cream paired nicely with the pavlova. (5/5, the excellent service was enough for me to overlook the burnt pavlova)Gooseberry semifredoInteresting presentation and flavor. Gf didn't really like it. I was neutral to it (3/5)Service (10/5)Extraordinary. Normally when I inform the restaurant that I'm celebrating a special event they would just do up a nice dessert plate. The staff of Salted and Hung went beyond their duty. They served us two glasses of refreshing sparkling wine as aperitif. And they concluded the meal with a off-the-menu dessert (read above). Very good!PS There is Amex dining privilege discounts on the main course

I feel chef Drew is a bit unheralded in Singapore. We came here last month for lunch and the food blew us away. I came here because I love homemade charcuterie, I love a chef that can take a cheap product and turn it into something wonderful. What I didnt expect was beautifully presented food , some with Asian accents, served on bespoke chinaware. We ordered; Beef Tongue with parsley and celeriac, Hamachi Collar with lard, bonito and french beans, Corn with manchego, chives and bonito, Brussel Sprouts with guanciale and miso ricotta and finally, Drew sold me on his spin on the classic Aussie Tim Tam. The food was perfectly seasoned and wonderfully presented by a well skilled chef with a deft hand. I love what he is doing and I also enjoyed the George Orwell Animal Farm artwork. A fun place with a great chef, as with most restaurants in Singapore, the waitstaff needs to be more attentive. But Drew and his food are spot on and deserve more of a spot light in the food scene in Singapore He cooks with passion and love and it shows! This place is one of my favorites in SE Asia. Highly recommended!! Best of luck chef
5
Great Value for money. Heaps of different options for dishes with amazing combinations. The free flow of craft beer was also a highlight.
5
Good food, great chef Drew. Service could be better, especially the bar services was a bit slow and non responsive.
5
My Husband and I visited salted and Hung on Friday and would highly recommend. Great food, we will be back soon
5
This was a six time I was in Spore. I had a very good meal indeed. Food is fabulous in every way. Chef Drew was so friendly and he gave me a btl of Salted and Hung negroni :) Beef tongue is my favorite paring with wines suggested by the waiter nice inspiring. It's a must for a great dining. Highly recommended 
4
We really enjoyed our first trip here! We will come back. The restaurant is fun and hip. There was a good buzz and the staff were friendly and knew the menu inside and out. We loved the charcuterie board and thought the mains - barramundi and lamb - were outstanding. The squid ink mash was totally out of this world and the cream corn was a close second. Beer and alcohol was a bit pricey but that was about the only slight drawback for an otherwise great dinner
5
We went here for dinner with 2 other friends last Saturday. It was my first time here and I'd definitely be back again - expensive but worth the money. All the food was wonderful but my favorite dishes were the lamb leg (melt in your mouth and full of flavour), corn (bonito added an interesting edge to creamed sweet corn) and kale (not what you'd expect from this virtuous vegetable). Less favorite were the scallops (didn't really go with the gem lettuce) and squid (done perfectly, not too chewy but flavour wasn't as exciting as the lamb, corn and kale). Last were the iberico collar and roast chicken.We also had the charcuterie which included their signature lardo. I'm not a fan of spare parts or fat, but this was interestingly flavoured cured fat - there's alot going on with the flavour and has a refined texture. I think it's worth a try, but I wouldn't order a whole portion. We also had a couple of glasses of lovely wine from Margaret River. Altogether a gorgeous meal, it's better to go in a group of 3 or more so that you can order more little plates. We have a brunch reservation with them and are really looking forward to it
5
Went down to try their weekend brunch. I agree with one of the comment that mentions the savoury foods are better than the desserts.The appetizer menu which is the Portobello really exceed my expectation. The habbilut is okThe steak with eggs are excellent the rib is juicy! Just that i felt its too raw. The wagyu pasta is nice too. My friend's favourite is the octopus! We ordered that twice. I would definetely come back to try more of their foodPs: i think the service is attentive just that all of them dont look friendly.
3
Weekend ala carte buffet brunch was pretty good. There wasnt a huge variety to choose from but the quality was there. There was also a anti-pasti bar which we could help ourselves to. The savoury food turned out better than the desserts. Really loved the smoked halibut on toast, portebello mushroom with egg on toast (nicely charred), wagyu ragu, grilled octopus, fried turbot (told them to go easy on salt when we ordered the 2nd portion) and bacon chop!The only let down was the poor service. We were not sure if it was a ala carte buffet or set menu and were also expecting an ala carte menu should we not want the buffet option. Nobody bothered explaining to us how the menu works. After all our guests had arrived and been seated, only the one guest who arrived earlier was served water and we constantly had to get the wait staff's attention for water & refills. Staff were not very friendly and we felt ignored half the time. They seemed to be there just chit chatting with each other and doing their own thing. It was not even crowded with a total of just a few tables of diners.If it was just for the food, will definitely be back for the weekend brunch buffet and hope to see new items on the menu. Service wise, they really ought to buck up. Would have given a "Very good" overall rating but downgraded it to "Average" because of poor service.
3
We turned up for our 8.30pm booking at 8.35pm and was told our table was not ready. We sat in the bar area to wait a bit. One hour later we were finally seated after much liaising with indifferent service staff. A few quirky menu items but nothing to rave about.
5
Every dish surprised us! So far, they've all been very unique and tasty! Service was excellent too! We sat at the bar counter and it's amazing to see a young team of experts running the kitchen. This restaurant has a bright future ahead! Keep up the good work!
5
Great food and service.. everyone was made to feel welcome and well looked after.. good alternative concept to a full on brunch
5
The seafood charcuterie was fantastic! Even the brussel sprouts and cauliflower were delicious. Will definitely go back :)
5
Salted & Hung was both unpretentious and elegant. Simple but very tasty dishes cooked to perfection. Service was good and the price was reasonable.
4
Went there with friends for their weekend brunch. Pleasant surprises indeed. Menu selection is sufficient. Thumbs up for their bacon chop, it is tooooo good, nicely charred and so tender, we had repeat orders for it. Their desserts of doughnuts and ice cream are also fantastic. And their wines are good too. Service is also good with attentive and knowledgeable staff
5
Our party of six enjoyed our dining experience. The food was very good. Staff was knowledgeable of food on offer and service was well paced and just the right level of attention. Often times, we find service in fine dining establishment to fall short; this is not the case here. The restaurant has a nice vibe. Definitely worth a return visit to sample more of the menu
4
I'd been here before as two couples and dropped an absolute bomb on the bill. The food was excellent though small (actually somewhat variable) servings, and the drink prices in particular really are overblown. So whilst we had a great time overall I didn't feel I could justify returning.However, they have started doing a fixed price brunch (food $58+ with drinks an add-on $30+) and this was much better value. The food had some of the same dishes as on the normal menu and were equally as good. Good thought has gone in to making dishes which are inventive without being odd with a high level in most. The only exception was the octopus which was too hard; a shame given that could have been delicious
5
Whenever someone asks for a restaurant recommendation, I will always recommend Salted and Hung. It was pricey (2 pax was almost $300. We were really full and had 2 rounds of drinks). I am really sad that they have removed my favorite sweetbread from the menu, and I do prefer the old scallops to the new scallops...but it was still a lovely meal. Really appreciate all the tastes combinations
5
The industrial chic decor and rustic-ish reputation of Charcuterie might have you fooled into believing that you're in for a simple meal but with so much effort invested in the preparation (salting & hanging, for one!) of each dish, you feel the love and care and attention to detail that translates with every bite. It's not often that a Chef's love for the cuisine and ingredients he works with comes across so clearly but it most certainly does here and it's so very appreciated. It was my first visit and I had the Tasting Menu and would recommend everyone order that. It's not 'cheap' at 'fine-dining' prices but the dishes come with a similar level of refinement, it presents tremendous value and a great way to feel your way around the menu and plot a return. Wait for the Anzac Biscuits at the end. Best ones I've had in my life. Loved it.
5
I enjoyed this place lots!Lovely relaxed environment (good music choice)Food was excellent and attention from staff was just right.My husband totally loved the look of the menu and was not disappointed.I am a vegetarian and was super impressed with the fresh pasta which was delicious.
5
I am a solo traveler staying at a hotel near by. Just happened to eat Hainan chicken rice the day before for lunch and walked by this interesting looking place. On a Saturday night I walked in after a foot massage around the corner at 7pm with no reservation. I had the last seat at what I would call the counter. The very best seat in the house where you can see all the actions in the open kitchen. Wow, what a night. What ever I saw that looked good I ate. It's like a floor show. Now the food, GREAT!!! This is not a cheap eat for local food but for that special evening out. I can tell you in 15 years coming to SIN this is one of top food experiences I've ever had
5
It was great again to have dinner with chef Drew again! Great dishes, wonderfully cured meat and a nice vibe. Very much a recommended place for a pleasant informal dinner with absolutely delicious food, cutting edge as you might expect of a great chef.
4
Interesting dishes and flavour that is worth digging deeper into your pockets for.
We tried the Iberico Pork, Mayura Flank, Kangaroo, Peanut Butter Tim Tams and the Anzac Biccies
5
Great service and great food - especially absolutely amazing desserts! We really liked the chill vibe and had a memorable evening.
5
From the charcuterie board through to the specials there wasn't a weak link here.
The smoked Mayura Flank may be one of the best individual dishes I've had in Singapore, and whilst it doesn't come cheap this definitely offers a change from the norm.
5
Loved the place and it's interior and how it played on the themes of animal farm, very fitting for the world we live in now ;) the meat platter is amazing and they really salt their meats deliciously!
5
Wandering back to our hotel we stumbled across salted and hung, quite simply some of the best, excuse the hyperbole, if not the best flavours and ingredients (including "in the clouds" red), small but perfectly formed, thank you all at salted and hung, a joy!
5
Had a wounderful dinner ! Amazing taste of each and every dish !
Very excellent staff !!
I'm totally fan of this restaurant!!
Mind glowing service !! Thank you so much chef ! For taking so good care of us !!!

Cool restaurant - well designedBUT: average food & overpriced.Wine we ordered was not available and after the first glass we had to change again since they ran out. (One glass of the "Boheme" at $22)Portions were all rather small. Kale was tasteless & greasy but Kangaroo Ta Ta was fantastic.The scallop for 26$ terribly overpriced - a joke.The Westholme Flank for $42 delicious but the portion very little.Beetroot & baby octopus very nicely presented and good.Good but certainly overpriced
3
The food was lovely, but everything was just to small. Mains were ample but the starters and sides were tiny, drinks were expensive $20 for a bottle of craft beer is extreme.The sides were served in small bowls which were half full, I am not a big eater but despite the fact we shared some starters, then had a starter each and a main we all left hungry.Just give us more is all I would sa
5
My wife and I were looking for a change from Asian and Australian was just the ticket. I enjoyed the lamb and my wife the roast chicken. Both dishes were excellent. I had a side of black mash. I love mashed potatoes, but this was my first try at black spuds. The jury is still out on the back mash but it was a new experience
5
I was sold when I saw the curing cabinet before sitting down! A unique experience with a foodie guest who was impressed with the very different meat experience!
5
Loved the food and the drinks were amazing. Waiter was a bit clumsy but I Guess some extra training will fix that. Definitely going back!
5
My friend brought me here for my birthday. I'm usually not fond of Australian food but this place is really unique. The dishes are exotic, unique but delicious. They also have an amazing beer collection and beer pairing with the menu.
5
Great place to visit.. Like the early bird options as adds extra value
Best thing to do is just order a variety of dishes and share, then reorder the ones the kids like
Good value and Drew is fun at sharing his knowledge
5
This has to be my favourite place in singapore. Every time I go here it's just the next level up. The squid and mackerel are must try's. As well as the Blackmore wagyu just so smoky and soooo good.

For the price I thought the dining experience was very mediocre. Apparently 7:01 pm is not 7 and happy hours no longer apply: that's always a way to make sure your customers are annoyed at the start of a meal, being finicky on happy hours by the minute (I checked my iPhone when I ordered). I was entertaining a guest so I didn't argue the point but perfect: great start to dinner.The annoyance continued with wines not being available and substituted by a cheap Austrian table wine. Nothing Australian about that wine. And nothing worth $85 about that wine too. No nose, nothing to write home about, typical jammy table wine.At the time of ordering, I ordered a lot of food (4 mains + appetizers + sides, for 5 people). The waiter then recommended their $150 lamb. Fortunately, I did not go for it. I added the last side because of his insistence (usually a signal from a waiter that you're not ordering enough food). Turns out we could not finish what we ordered and we are big eaters. Come on. I like places that are nice enough to help me balance a meal by ordering the right choices, not the ones that are the highest $$$.All in all, we spent well upwards of $100 a person, which is perfectly fine as a number (I often spend more than that) but I never felt comfortable and happy at dinner, and that's unfortunate.Note: the food was good. The kale was terrific. As was the lard. The pork collar was great. The portions are small. And its a bit odd that a tapas ish place does not have bread to go with the charcuterie (we had these crackers instead that didn't match the flavor profile of the charcuterie).The dining experience was though not worth it. Front of house ... meh: I just felt nickeled and dimed all the way through. So go if you are on an expense account, and don't need to bother which such plebeian concerns, else there are far better options in Singapore

You could feel that the whole team of kitchen staff had put their heart into preparing the food from the little details. The warm cookie served at the end of dessert to go with coffee or tea, or the tiny shavings of pitan that were in the cauliflower rice which added that extra burst of flavours. I enjoyed my meal and I told my foodie friends about Salted and Hung. I hope they would visit soon and have an even better time

Was here for lunch and I ordered the wagyu burger and the wagyu bresaola.The wagyu burger was delicious, but wasn't particularly outstanding among the burgers I've had.The wagyu bresaola, one of the specials that day, was divine however. It was thin strips of aged beef, on an egg yolk, on a grilled portobello mushroom. The caramelized glaze on the mushroom definitely elevated the dish, and the extra char flavour tied everything perfectly well together.A pity their degustation menu requires a minimum of a pair to order, and it's difficult to find friends willing to splurge on great food. I am sure there's much more to discover in this restaurant

We had a large group eat here for dinner, so a deposit was required to reserve the table. The food quality was appropriate but the portions of most of the mains were not large except for the whole roast chicken. The black mash was tasty and unique. Perhaps we were there at a bad time, but the service was very slow and we were very hungry by the time we were served
4
Fabulous food but a tad too expensive~ must try dishes includes;Squid - grilled to perfection & comes with ink mayoHamachi Collar - heavenly is the only word I can use to describe this dishBlack Mash~ Flavorful but a little too heavy even for 2 pa

Dinner for 6 pax at Salted & Hung. Enjoyed the BYO Tuesday. Great food introduced by friendly and helpful staff. Interesting food selection for the adventurous diners.
5
Unique presentation and taste together with a sharing experience creates 5 star. Price is steep otherwise I will go more often
5
Very noisy and busy place, it has a meaty menu even though it's in mite-sizes. However the food was excellent - even a simple snack like the croquettes was very good. would definitely come back again
4
Fine dining quality food at reasonable prices. Interesting flavor concepts and the dishes are well plated. Do give them a try
4
The food was delicious and well presented. We went for the fixed menu with paired beers. The micro brew Aussie beers were excellent and paired well.
If you don't mind a really noisy restaurant onvr full, then this is a worthwhile place to visit.

Came here for lunch and it was a great find.
A very carnivorous menu, I opted for a toastie and it was great. But rich and a little greasy.
The fresh juice I had was tasty.
2
I had pretty high hopes when I saw the reviews for this place. Looks like the restaurant has employed cyber bloggers go "promote" their restaurant!
If you feel flushed with cash and don't mind going to try.... Prepare to be disappointed!
5
I've been twice and each time never failed to please. The food is interesting mod Oz. Favourites were the mackerel, Barramundi, beef tongue and pork belly... Worth several return visits! Set lunch is 25$ for 2 courses and 35 $for 3.
4
Food was quite good. We had squid with a black ink yuzu sauce, and sweetbreads for appetisers. I love sweetbread and it is pretty rare to see them in Singapore. For main dishes, we had flank with a pomegranate sauce and a fish with collar and the head... don't recall the fish. Flank is really good.The food is a bit on the pricey side but I think the food quality is really good. Will come back but only for special occasions.We were there on not too balmy an evening, not sure how the "open entrance and not much air-con" set-up will hold up.

After having a sling at the Raffles Hotel we walked around to find a place to eat. Came across the Salted and Hung which is located outside Raffles City. They had a set menu but we decided to have a few of the different types of tapas. The assorted meats was delicious and had to order more bread to go with it. The ribs were nice but messy of course. The atmosphere is friendly and had a good wine selection. It is pricey though
5
This is the 3rd time I've been to the place. I love the pork collar, juicy and tender. I tried the wagyu beef this week, it's just as good.
5
a pity that this restaurant is not more popular - the lunch we enjoyed was delicious and very good value
5
Happy hour was very good: 1 for 1 beers, elixers and wine. Had an Innocent Bystander Pinot Noir and Hedonist Cab Sav and their squid ink mayo white bait! Food off the the main menu was good as well, really enjoyed the Iberico Collar.
5
Love the food here. Perfectly cooked meat, well-presented, and the selection of wines by the glass: to die for!!
4
Great value, well presented and tasty food for set lunch.
we tried 2 different sets - choosing 2 out of 3 options abd all turned out great!
4
Good food, everything was great. Portion is like fine dining. Was advise to order 8 to 9 plates for 3 people. On a slightly pricey side.

The restaurant was dimly lighted with open kitchen. There was no much customers for weekday lunch. Looking through the menu, I decided on the 3 course lunch set ($35++).Pork BellyApple, cucumber & mustardThe pork belly was cut up into small pieces, tasted quite juicy. The apple and cucumber shaved into thin slices made a very tangy side.Red SnapperDashi broth, fennel & sea herbsIt was steamed fish in light broth. The fish was firm and juicy, while the broth was light and flavourful. The thinly sliced fennel lent a citrus taste to the simple dish.PopcornRaspberry & popcorn textureIt was served in shades of pinks, but it was a different story in the mouth. Closed one's eyes, it was like butter popcorn which one usually have when watching movies, with popping effect in the mouth.I finished the meal with a cup of chocolaty latte and a piece of Anzac Biccies which tasted of bacon and salted caramel, totally different from the Anzac I used to have back in Australia

First visit to Salted and Hung. Had the $75 lunch set, which in retrospect sounded better than the actual food, which was very average at best. The beef was nicely done but not very flavourful and the fish was not very fresh. Towards the middle of the course the plates took forever to arrive. We waited nearly 20 minutes for one dish to arrive even. Service was sterile and uninviting. All in, not a place I would want to go back to unless there's a major upgrade
4
We tried the set festive menu for lunch. We had the grilled cauliflower, fish and semi-fredo. Some may find the portions a tad small but I thought it was perfect. We also shared a side beetroot salad. Real Beets and not from the tin. It was lovely. This is a "must try" place. Hop

Food here was delicious and as expected from their name, the meat dishes tended to be the highlight of the meal. Surprisingly, despite their name, the seasoning and salt level of the dishes are all quite light which i assume is intended for you to focus on the taste of the ingredients themselves (wagyu was amazing). Only thing stopping me from giving them 5 stars is that some of the flavours were abit clashing and didnt quite harmonize. Nevertheless, still a fantastic dining experience and I'd definitely go back
5
Attentive servers. The food is well plated and delicious. The location is very accessible. The place is cozy
5
Lovely restrained use of ingredients which highlighted both the quality of the produce and technique of the kitchen. Will definitely be back!
5
We had an excellent evening! Food is great, the team on the floor is very attentive, desserts are fantastic too!
3
Great ambience. Staff was polite and friendly during visit. However, the price may be a little steep compared to other restaurants nearby with comparable quality of food. Will consider coming back again if im in the vicinity.
4
Salted and Hung is a friendly, casual and quite competent place for those who like their meat and offals.
5
We went there with friends and had a really good time! The food was excellent and the main idea is to share all the meals which is great to try everything!
Special mention for the burrata and desserts!!!
Service impeccable and really efficient!

I've now visited Salted and Hung four times (or maybe more!) and each time the food has been excellent. Inventive, high quality and ultimately superbly tasty food. The room is great for a group of friends dining together, or if you're only two then take a seat at the bar and watch Chef Drew and his team cook up their creations. The wine list is reasonably priced too so you won't leave feeling like you've over spent.

Food was creative, made with great produce and looked fantastic. My boyfriend ordered tripe which I was dubious about but it was great. Kangaroo and Iberico chop were also amazing. There wasn't anything we didn't really enjoy. I found the service excellent. There was always at least one member of staff looking over to see if you needed anything. We sat on the stools at the kitchen and watched the kitchen team preparing the food which was brilliant. The chef checks every plate before it goes out. I would highly recommend.

Loved the mackerel, squid, lamb, kangaroo and of course the unique desserts (we had three to share among 2 ladies and a little boy)! The meats were totally tender and intensely flavourful. Planning Togo back to try the hamachi, trout, beef tongue, tripe and scallop. The service team's attentive and friendly too.

This is an excellent restaurant and great value for money. I loved the open kitchen and watching the owner sharing his knowledge with his staff. Husband and I tried the Chef's Pairing Menu. Most of the food was excellent. The crisp bread that went with the charcuterie was excellent, loved the caraway seeds. I'm not a beetroot fan but my husband loves it so was a big fan of the beetroot tartare. The pork sausage was delicious and made me realise how much I miss good sausages. Next was the fish tail which looked amazing but was a bit dull. The last savoury dish was Wagyu tri tip and it was AMAZING. I could just eat plates and plates of this forever. Dessert was a peanut butter tim tam which was pretty tasty. The wine menu is decently priced and you can add a beer pairing to the dinner menu which sounds very interesting and which I may well try on my next visit. This is definitely one to add to your list

Went there with a gf on a Friday night. Pleasantly surprised to find its happy hour till 7pm! Lovely! Food is nice! Quality and no pretense! yummy!
5
We stumbled upon this restaurant by walking around. Decided to eat early and have the new tasting menu for October. Food was amazing. Loved everything that was brought out especially the Tim tam like dessert. Try this place, you won't be disappointed.
2
The menu was so promising but each dish just wasn't quite right when it hit the table. Very diappointing and I couldn't understand a word the waiter said.
5
Two options - $25 or $35 for two or three courses. We went for three and the appetisers we ordered were corns, roasted pork, and mackerel. The pork was the best - delicious. I would order two sets just to have it twice. Mains were great too. We ordered wine and it was only $10 per glass. The juice we liked were orange apple and ginger. The watermelon one is a bit diluted. Desserts were amazing - try chocolate salami. We will definitely come back for lunch and dinner. Service was good too - forgot to mention earlier.

Not impressed, this feels like an attempt to replicate a successful establishment in the keong saik area.Perhaps this was not their intention, but rather a industry wide reality where the style decor and concept seem to adhere to a formula that has proven to have a good likelihood of success.Food was forgettable, tripe especially sounded great on the menu but was underwhelming. The iberico was the best dish, but this is nowhere a test of a chef's skill, given that most of these items are made with prime ingredients. Hence no special mention for the wagyuService could improve, staff not hospitable enough. Table reservation policy was puzzling. We requested to move from a high table to a normal dinner table if available, given that there were reservations that night. Most establishments which don't require a prepay guarantee would not hold a table longer than half an hour. For the entire hour plus we were there, i think they were 2 or 3 tables left empty for no shows. But on the flip side, this means you can make reservations here without a care! I'd recommend it if your group is always tardy and u need peace of min

We sat at the counter top, facing the kitchen. The menu is varied and offers choices you won't normally see in other restaurants. Lots of josper grilling going on here! We tried several dishes, main stand outs were the kangaroo and the beef ribs! We will certainly be back
3
I was there for lunch at 12:30pm, and it was 75% packed. Service was attentive, but the dishes took a long time to be cooked and served. My three course set lunch ended only at 1:50pm. I felt the wait staff was a little pushy in pushing the drinks order too - I was asked thrice if I wanted any wine, and twice if I would like coffee/tea. Some of the dishes were hits and misses - the short ribs were fabulous, but the pork trotter (starter) was mediocre
1
Food is creative, and that's the only good thing I can say for this new Aussie joint. Firstly, I nearly twisted my ankle going into the tiny bathroom with an ever so tiny step that was barely noticeable - and after pointing it out to the owner, he didn't even apologise for it. At least the waiter had the courtesy to. Food portions were measly, flavours barely noticeable and prices abhorrent for what we got! They ran out of sweetbreads - because the table before us had the gall to order it! We were the only other table in the whole restaurant at that point! Only saving grace, the service from the wait staff was good, attentive, and polite! But of course, you'd expect that when there weren't many other diners to serve. I'd recommend the Malbec, but that's because it came straight out of a bottle. Wouldn't be returning any time soon, or at all really.

I booked at this new restaurant trusting the UnlistedConnection umbrella and expecting a similar concept to another restaurant in town. Indeed, I felt it was a comparable vibe, but just something was a bit off.We ordered a selection of plates and the sausages that were on the daily board was the probably the top dish we had.As it is relatively new, perhaps it needs some time to get in the groove
4
Had 3 course set today and changed dessert for 2nd starter....for $35. Real value with chef surprise freeby and coffee on house. Interesting menu. Beetroot pork and beef meatballs and short rib were all very good esp the latter tender and rare with just right marbling of fat... also ordered platter of different cured meats inc pate to supplement.Only other comment is noise level when busy...music and hard finishes. Strong recommendation for great hearty meal.Service was good. No complaint
