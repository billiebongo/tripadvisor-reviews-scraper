We had a quick lunch prior to heading to airport. Two dishes one chicken and one salmon.
Meal was tasty ordered on line,staff helpful and efficient.
For cost and flavour a good choice.

Service here is fast and efficient. There are tables and chairs to have your meal. The food here is a bit on the salty side but otherwise its really good value. The beef rice set is good value to have and very delicious.

Yoshinoya is franchise rice bowl restaurant from Japan. We order breaded shrimp rice bowl. It is just ok. The shrimp is crispy, with some vegetable. Suitable for quick lunch or dinner.

We came here to eat for dinner.The service was really nice and fast.The food tasty, and you can have unlimited drinks (on a cup, or tea).We could go there one more time without thinking, good choice to eat for a decent price

I just went up the Bugis MRT and up to the Bugis Junction. The restaurant is not so far from the escalators. The food is delicious. The place is nice and clean. The food stalls are quite crowded during lunch time. Its a convenient place to eat and shop

Extremely hungry, after fast walking from MRT to check in to the Hotel.. fortunately Yoshinoya save my life ! LoL.. just order a bowl then for few blinking's.. the food ready ! yet the taste is standard as other Yoshinoya's but service is extremely fast

Yoshinoya quality and taste seem consistent, whatever country you're in. I've tried their outlets in Japan, Philippines,and Hongkong. I have always enjoyed the simple meal of thin beef slices cooked in special broth over rice. My latest meal is in the branch at Heartland Mall. Taste and presentation are consistent. For better dining experience, don't forget to add spoonfuls of red picked ginger over the beef bowl and a dash of Yoshinoya spices. I find it also a good idea to pair it with a hot bowl of miso soup. Guaranteed satisfaction.

Yoshinoya is known for its beef rice. I tried this, and I do not believe it is anything special. It certainly is a good fast food choice: extremely cheap and somewhat healthy. However, it has a very average taste and I would not recommend it to foodies

Yoshinoya realy offer a complete food in a bowl. Good quality of beef slices, assorted veggies and nicely cook rice. Add the bowl with their soya sauce and chili powder to make it more perfect.

Yoshinoya is pretty famous for the beef rice. Good healthy delicious japanese beef rice. What taste good is the strips of beef.
Well it is common around Singapore and many asian countries. Good place to have quick lunch.

I had the beef and rice bowl which is nothing amazing but really good for fast food. The price is cheap for what you get.
I wish we had this place back home.

Went to eat here before we went to Bugis Street. We tried the chicken curry which is very delicious!
3
The quality of rice (=mixed Japanese and other short grains), fish and beef is very low. I know, it's a cheap eat concept. But for the price they charged I'm 100% confidently that I could find a better food in the same price.

just had lunch at yoshinoya (heartland mall) and tried something new today - the wayu beef set. It is delicious!

We had the beef bowl that was on special, it was tasty and filling as rice came with it. The ambience at lunch time was not great but it is in a shopping center,with teenagers and children present.Worth a try we would eat there again.

Me & my partner definitely (heart) their beef bowl with vegie. I like their tofu dessert also - which I forgot the name. Anytime we hv to go for lunch, we definitely will seek for this place. Indeed, the price quite pricey if compare with hawker food and the ambience is not that good but what do you expect from fast food :
