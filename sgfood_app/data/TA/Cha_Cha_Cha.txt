Unusual to have GF at Mexican but these guys have loads of options. Good vibe, great location in the middle of Holland Village, quick service and quality food. Reasonably priced aswell.

Dinner was excellent. Cascara bi tapa (Potato skins with chilli con carne); beef stew, tortilla with rice; and Mexican beef tapa. All washed down with black rum and tequila. Great service from Jonel.

Good Mexican food is hard to come by in SE Asia, Cha Cha Cha would be the exception. The chips and salsa are authentic. The fish tacos, chimichanga, and quesadillas were excellent. The guacamole, refried beans, and Spanish rice were flavorful. The portion sizes were more than adequate and the service was prompt and courteous

After having multiple craptastic experiences sampling Mexican food in Singapore, I would say this place rates about mid-range, and my experience was favourable enough that I would return. The flavours are a little bit off, but overall, it's what you'd expect from a Mexican restaurant. I had a frozen mango margarita - pretty good; and a lime margarita on the rocks - also pretty good. I ordered the chicken fajitas - came as one would expect, with tortillas, and sizzling seasoned chicken, sauteed with peppers and onions, though the seasoning/flavours only hit about the 50% accuracy mark. Chips and salsa free of charge (a rarity, it seems). I would return. I forgot to try the desserts

I have been to Cha Cha Cha several times and went again yesterday. Whether it's starter, main course or dessert, this place never disappointed me.Jalepino poppers are my most favorite..We tried Kaluha Chocolate mousse yesterday, it was super yummy. It's not at all heavy on stomach and felt like melting in mouth smoothly.Tried blueberry margarita and it was good. Service is top-notch, plenty of service staff to take orders or to serve water

We visited Cha Cha Cha with our young sons. While the service was only fair, the food was very good - fresh and tasty Mexican! Between us we shared chicken nachos, prawn tacos and beef fajitas (our favourite dish). The boys finished the meal with an ice cream. Meals are priced comparatively (mid-range) with other restaurants in this area of Holland Village. If you like good Mexican in a relaxed atmosphere it's worth a visit

It didnt happen to my table but the table beside me. I saw them jolt out of their table and I saw a huge cockroach running on the table. And then a few others scurried across the floor. This is an eatery. Cockroaches are a no no. The staff were not alarmed at all, I wonder why.. And then just tried to remove the plates from the table and didn't even attempt to catch or kill the roaches. The food was also so so and not impressive and the staff were not very helpful when I asked if there's any dish without onions. They just everything has onions and walked away.
4
On waiters:We had 2. One was excellent (young tall guy), the other one (old guy) a bit more distant, not very pleasant and hard to understand when he spoke.Service was quite quick. The drinks have a laughable small amount of alcohol, but also not terribly expensive. If you are picky on this, better order a beer.Food: The amount of food was very good for a normal appetite.We got there around 10 pm and kitchen still open no problem. We left around 10.45 pm and people were still ordering stuff

Holland Village is a crowded place during the evenings. The evening I went to Cha Cha Cha it was not that many people in the restaurant. Years back I remember it to be more people a round. You get nachos and salsa as a a starter. I tried the beef fajitas, which was so so.
3
food was ok. There was a mix up with one of our meals, instead of letting us know we had to chase for the food, which came after everyone else had eaten with a message, there was a mix up. No apology no notice. Get the impression that this place is lacking in any one working there who actually cares
2
No atmosphere, frozen slush called Margaritas with no tequila or even much taste, jarred salsa and canned chicken in the chicken dishes. Very expensive for bad food and drinks.
5
Has great food - fagitas and their margaritas are my favorite. they seating both indoor and outdoor - bang on the Holland V street - quite a happening place. so must eat and visit
4
Been here a few times. Good is tasty and reasonably priced. We had the nachos, margarita and quesadilas. Ambience is also good.
4
We spent a day off at Holland Village and we had dinner here. Mexican food was great and we enjoyed different dishes, like quesadillas, fajitas and tacos. Waiters were polite but we expected they took more care about customer.
5
This restaurant has been around for ages. Not traditionally mexican but friendly staff, the usual suspects menu and well proced jugs of frozen margaritas make for a pleasant dining experience. Open to the street allows for people watching. The mango frozen margarita is awesome. My family oves this place and we are regular visitors
2
I was looking in Singapore for a traditional, classic Mexican food experience. The reviews that I read in Trip Advisor and other places suggested that Cha Cha Cha was an established and classic Mexican restaurant. Well, I had dinner there tonight, and I have to report that it didn't impress me. The drinks were weak, the food didn't taste homemade and overall, it's not a great Mexican food experience. I wanted it to be great, but it fell short on all fronts.
4
If you are expecting authentic mexican food this may not score high. However we liked the taste and the vegetarian options which scores high on our rating scale. service was good. We visited for dinner during a weekday with no crowd. Service quality need to be tested during crowded weeken
2
Dinner for 5. The front of the restaurant is a good place to chill and people watch. We ordered Nachos and Queso to share and both were pretty good. No one had complains about their food. I had the fish tacos as the main course and I wasn't sure what fish they were using but they can improve on the quality. Overall, tasty and well portioned.What we didn't like were some of the staff's attitude. Unfriendly and impatient, and the restaurant wasn't exactly busy. While ordering food the server made us feel like we were imposing on him
4
It's been one of my favourite restaurants for 4 years. Food has been consistently good. Their nachos are my personal favorite. The place serves good, value-for-money margaritas.The restaurant is in a good locality as well. Avoid the tables at the inside end. Enclosed space.. gets so loud and noisy.
4
The entire place was empty during lunch so it was only me and my friend - that was good. They have a front porch area and one can imagine sitting there, staying into space which is fun. They had all the classical Mexican place so it was fun - burritos / fajitas / tacos etc etc. refried beans was no good. Its all the normal food but its affordable and great for tex-mex
3
We ordered the usual nachos, fajitas, burritos etc. All veg. Food was average. The nachos were not crisp. The rest of the items were also just ok. nothing authentically mexican
3
I like tge restauranr in the,past but not now. Food taste ok, portion becomes smaller, somehow just less satisfactory compared to the past. Margarita is good though.
4
This is a good Tex Mex restaurant with great choices. Friendly staff and with a good atmosphere. Tables inside or out and has a real Mexican feel. Not the cheapest but food is good and great for all types of people. From families to groups
4
Been here multiple times because I love Mexican food and like the vibe of Holland Village. This place is ideal as it is in the middle of the street, you can watch people and serves great Mexican food. Do try the frozen margarita's!
5
Very nice place for frozen margaritas and tasty Mexican food. The ambience also is nice with very friendly staff.
Easy to reach with taxies easily available and walkable distance from MRT station.
2
Well, I visited this restaurant with my wife in March, 2014. Both of us love Mexican food and have tried Mexican food in various cities around the world. But this restaurant does not come even remotely close to authentic Mexican food. Food portions are very small and even nachos were soggy. Did not like it at all. Won't recommend.
3
Cha Cha Cha had been my favorite Mexican restaurant in Singapore for quite a few years now, and I use to frequent it as I live in close proximity. Note the past tense in my first sentence. I don't know what changed, but though the flavors are still delicious, the generosity and service are now sub par. Yes, I've patronized them through their price increases and renovation. I'd forgiven them when they had a bad day and the food was unimpressive after I had been raving about it to my dad and he finally agreed to try. But apparently they think its acceptable that they keep cutting corners. The portions are much smaller than they use to be. They don't serve welcome nachos with salsa when you are seated anymore. And though they use to do that, I always still ordered their shredded beef nachos. And even though I have to pay extra for the sour cream and guac now, they barely give enough anything to cover my less than heap-full of nachos that are about $20/plate. Nothing comes with vegetables anymore.And to top it off, the service is so grouchy. It makes me feel like I owe them to eat there. Seriously, I will still come here for my mexican fix, but I'll think twice, and consider my options as there are plenty of new (and pretty good), up and coming mexican restaurants around the island
2
Well, it seems like a lot has been said about the poor quality of the service by other reviewers, which I completely agree with. Regarding our personal experience, who the hell would price 45 SGD (tax non included) a sangria with 3 slices of oranges and a very poor wine that you find 2 SGD at the supermarket ?! But of course, margaritas were recommended so we were supposed to drink only that, right ? So for anyone who is looking for a nice Mexican restaurant, I'd advise to go somewhere else
2
Let's start with the good stuff. The Margaritas were perfect, tasty and strong. I had the chimichangas which was decent, and I loved the jalape単os and chilli con carne starters. The quesadillas were nice too. Food and drinks came out very fast, and that is commendable.Onto the things that desperately need improvement. We went there on a Sunday and were greeted by the faces of staff that clearly loved their job and looked forward to serving us (I'm being sarcastic). We had to inform the staff that we had a reservation 3 times, and were left standing next at the entrance next to the only long table that was reserved that was clearly for our large group. Had to ask for a baby chair 3 times also. The worst part was, every time you ask for something, the attitude and face you get was one of doing me a bloody favour. Short of rolling their eyes, the entire demeanour was that of disdain. No "ok no problem" or "yes how can I help?". It was a "listen and walk away without acknowledging" kind of attitude. Seriously, your staff are in need of some proper training. It might seem trivial to you guys, but it makes a big difference. I've worked F&B so I get that it's difficult sometimes, but it's a vital part of the service industry!Needless to say that totally ruined the entire lunch for me. My fajitas were also tasteless and uninspiring. The enchiladas were really good, though.In sum, you could throw a stone at any other place serving the same type of food and get as decent if not better grub. The service was the thing that seriously put me off. Personally? I'll come back for jalape単os and margaritas but nothing else, and even then, there are probably better places.

Don't be fooled by the reviews claiming it to be great or amazing , it was far from that. We had made a reservation for 12 people for Father's Day, since my dad is an avid fan of Mexican cuisine, he wanted to try this place . When we reached we were greeted by staff who were unsure about reservation procedures , they didn't smile and seemed like they were there because they had no choice . There was a serious lack of management , which resulted in very poor service. We ordered chips with salsa and their stuffed jalape単os , both were good especially the stuffed jalape単os really enjoyed that. We ordered our mains and were incredibly disappointed by it , fajitas were blend, chimichangas were average and their prawn dishes had such small portions for their 26 dollar price . Enchiladas, fish tacos were pretty good but we have had better at other restaurants. Margarita jugs were cheap at 40 a jug but lacked the taste of tequila and tasted like lime juice. We didn't bother staying for dessert. Overall pretty average with high prices. will definitely not be in a hurry to recommend this place my friends Nor will I come back again.
3
Food is average Mexican fare. Greasy, cheesy, heavy stuff. Go on a weekend night and enjoy the outstanding atmosphere of Holland Villages.
1
Went there for brunch with Brother and family hoping for some authentic Mexican food and what we got was horrible food and poor service. Definitely ain't coming back again.
3
As the title says it..very nice quesadillas they have..we ordered the grounded beef quesadillas and it's delicious with the cheese filling. We also ordered their chili con carne and guacamole dip with nachos, it was average.
5
Went on a friday night. Surprisingly, didn't have to queue, that is a plus point! The food was alright, we got a plate of beef nachos, and i ordered the cha cha cha combinados or something like that, it was fantastic. Price is reasonably affordable. The staffs were really friendly. will definitely go back for more
4
2nd visit (first was last year). Nicely presented, open air layout with good airflow and A/C further inside the restaurant. Menu is what you would expect for Mexican. Service was super quick with water provided (not have to ask). Frozen margarita''s and dips served in less than 5 minutes. Mains were tasty and again prompt. My expectations were fully met for this kind of restaurant. Holland Village is a great place to visit and Cha, Cha, Cha is well worth a try
4
My family treated me to a wonderful Mother's Day dinner here, the nachos were delicious and we washed it down with a large pitcher of refreshing frozen lime margaritas. Although choices of mains were limited, quality was maintained. Highly recommend the fish tacos. Overall, a nice joint to visit on a Saturday night.
1
Ordered a 'burrito' which can loose (not close to being wrapped), on a plate. Chili meat dumped on top and guacamole heaped onto the bottom (again on the outside). Only way I could eat was with a knife and fork which turned into a mess. Didn't taste exactly great either.Worse was the chili con carne. This came with baked beans in instead of kidney beans so the taste/texture was just wrong! Talk about trying to save money...All in all, terrible. Another case of 'style' over substance. Trying to be hipster and failing on the food front

One of the wonderful gifts of travel is being able to visit a place over a number of years. I lived in Singapore from 1995 through 1999, and have visited many time since, most recently this past March. I always make a point of setting aside enough time aside for a stroll through Holland Village, and a meal at Cha, Cha, Cha. I attend the first year anniversary in 1997 and as a whole the menu, and quality of food has not changed. They have migrated from the local tiger beer, Tiger to San Miguel. The menu has always stayed on the safe side or the Rio Grande, with burritos, tacos, fajitas, enchiladas, chilli rellenos, chimichangas, and frozen margaritas.The quality and flavor of the food has always been good. They do not pretended to be in Oaxaca or El Paso. What the do have is a comfortable location to enjoy Tex-Mex meal, friendly service, and a pedestrians view of street life in Holland Village. The crowd favorite appears to by the frozen margaritas, that should help you compensate for not vacationing in Mexico
5
Had a pretty good and filling lunch here. Fast service, nice ambience, and food was very tasty with generous portions. Had the soft corn tacos with chicken shreds which comes with mexican rice. Glad to note that the meat stuffing was really generous and not dry. Chips with salsa was served before our mains. I would come here again. Service might be better if the dishes were cleared after the customers have left.
2
We ended up here for a Sunday lunch!! They stay open late while some others in the area close early for lunch. And that maybe the only reason you would want to go here!Very bland food nothing hot to bring out the flavors! We orders Tacos ( Beef ) and Fajita (Chicken). Both would get a one star rating in my book. Same accompaniments bland as ever. Thanks to some salvaging using the salsa dip that was given with Nachos ( complimentary) we managed to just get through the meal! Ambience is average. 3/5Service is fast and staff very friendly 4/5Again - 2/5 overall . Won't come back!

this restaurant is located in a very happening place.. best on friday late evenings!
can enjoy vegetarian food..
4
Cha Cha Cha has a variety of options for vegetarians. They serve good Mexican food, and Tom & Jerry cartoon show for entertainment (no music).
4
Right now at the restaurant with a friend totally satisfied with food margarita shots and service
Will visit again for sure
4
Loved the food...tasted great...enjoyed it a lot..ambience is great. ...good food
Quality n value for money.. service was good too...Holland village is a great place n got lots of options.
4
Located in heart of holland village...Cha Cha Cha has great variety of quality mexican food with decent price.
Have been there several times and will remain fav for mexican food.
3
Food is okay but can be better.
Place is nice, pleasant ambiance and decent service.
Can give it a try!
4
Had lunch here and the food was great. We had a combination meal that had a taco, enchilada, beans and rice. Really good pricing! The house wine was drinkable and cheap for Singapore. It wasn't too busy and no one hurried us out of the restaurant. Good food, reasonably priced, ok dÃ©cor
5
As a mexican, I can tell you that this is a fine place. I have to convince my children to eat in other places, as the enchiladas and the quesadillas do taste like home. Do visit on a Friday evening, but reserve beforehand. They close the street at Holland Village, and its nice
4
One thing I really need when eating out is good service with a smile. It does not really matter if it is a casual dinner place or a chic wine n dine. Cha cha cha is one place where they do so, and with minimum waiting time. They even customized the dishes for us. Food portions are all right, not at all bad for the price. Love their burrito salad! It's actually enough for a meal
3
Located in the heart of Holland Village in Singapore, Cha Cha Cha was once one of my hot favourites. But the place now a confused crossover between a fast food joint and an authentic Mexican dining restaurant. The margaritas area good, and so are most items on the menu. The ambience however could be a lot better.
4
The food is fantastic and I absolutely loved the nachos and quesadillas. The chicken burritos were also great and the ambience was casual and welcoming- I enjoyed the meal!
5
My favourite place for margarita. Especially like the way they have it frozen. Location is accessible and it has a great atmosphere at night
3
We enjoyed a relaxing meal at Cha Cha Cha, one of many restarants fronting a bustling pedestrian street in the town center..
3
Went out with some friends to Cha Cha Cha for a relaxed evening. The service wa super slow and it was very difficult to catch anybody's attention there. Moreover, they wait for you to order mains (even after you get drinks) to give you any chips, which is a downer.Between 4 of us, we got some frozen Lime Margarita (reasonably well made), beer, Veggie Nachos (average), Fish Tacos, Mushroom Quesedillas (slightly flat and flavourless), and Chilli Rellenos (without any sauce or dips!). The food was half decent but the poor service left the last impression
4
Went we two daughters and we had Fajitas and Buritos to eat as we did not feel like cooking tonight and food was good.It is nothing over the top however prices are not over the top neither so think is all relevant to what you are paying.Margharitas looked nice however did not induldged.We sat on the inside area on the balcony slightly elevated from road which was nice, think inside might be a little noisy.we will be back and if you want quick easy meal with no fuss then head to Cha Cha ChaService was just OK, a little in-personal however as mentioned before you pay for what you ge
1
We were queuing at the restaurant beside when decided to transfer coz it seems that theres more people eating here that we thought maybe their food is better but we were wrong. We ordered nachos, chicken fajitas, pollo chipotle, frozen margarita and a beer. Nachos and drinks were ok and it came quickly but the main dishes took ages before it was served. Not just it took so long but they have given us wrong food, instead of pollo chipotle they gave us quesadillas which is for the table beside us, and if we didn't ask they will not realize that they served the wrong food. As for the fajitas, they served the wraps and small portion of lettuce first and it seems that they forgot about the chicken that we need to ask for it. Taste was so-so with a steep price to match.
2
A jug of margaritas and original nachos that we ordered first was fine. So, we expected that food will be OK too. But it wasn't main dish was suck! No marinade meat or slow cook existing for this place.This restaurant was so empty compared to Mexican next to it which was super full. End up try this one and understood WHY.
3
The menu was quite uninspiring and pretty limited. The restaurant was lucky to be half full, but still they couldn't manage to bring four meals out together. Too bad if you wanted to order more food or drinks, other than a young waiter who continually refilled water glasses, the only other staff member continually chose to ignore us
3
Well first up the food here is average and may have been great ten years ago but people have higher expectations of Mexican food these days. But it is an easy place with an open air vibe so a nice place to sit back and people watch in Holland Village. One small niggle is that the fajita comes with three wraps which is not enough, but when you order one more set of wraps there is not enough lettuce and chicken to go around. I guess the portions could be a little larger. I didn't have any alcohol so can't comment on that. Food is delivered quickly which is a plus. It's a nice place to hang with friends but not a place to impress
1
We never went to this restaurant before but happened to try it today only beacuse al patio (another mexican restaurant next to cha cha cha) was full.All I will say is that they should close down the resturant and do themselves and all of us some favour......they have no clue remotely what Mexican food is and how it tastes. All our dishes seemed tasteless, as if chef forgot to put everything in it....worst was oozing oil out of everything,.....everything was deep fired and tasteless.This was our first and last visit.....never ever visiting again....we are ready to return back hungry :
2
We ordered Chicken Quesadilla, Prawn enchilada, Hard Taco. The food was bland all through. Didnt feel like I was having mexican food.
2
I hear a lot of cha cha cha versus el patio in holland. Sorry no contest. El patio wins. Basic science required in deep frying fillings.... They should not be cold
1
Daughter-in-law wanted to eat here as she had been a couple of years ago and had enjoyed the experience. It must have gone downhill pretty quickly since then. The place was noisy, the EQ on the background music seemed to only allow loud bass frequencies, our waiter had a 'couldn't care less' attitude, and the table was grubby. It had a tiled top with grout that had collected the droppings off many plates.We hoped that the food would make up for it - after all, the place was full, so it must have something going for it. How wrong we were. We ordered a mixture of enchiladas, soft and hard tacos, with beef and chicken. It was disgusting! All the meals were tasteless and bland. I personally had the chicken, which had been shredded and came with a bit of grated cheese, some shredded lettuce and a dollop of what could have been guacamole. And then there was the price. For five of us, with two of us having dessert, plus four coffees and a couple of beers, this came to SGD 181 (about £90). I know that Holland Village is the 'in' place to be seen in the evening, but this dump is taking the mickey. For Cha Cha Cha to call itself a Mexican Restaurant is a joke. Buy a Fajita kit and make your own - I can guarantee it'll be more tasty AND you'll save yourself a fortune. Definitely a place to avoid
2
I've dined here periodically over the years (at least a decade if memory serves me correctly). What I've sadly witnessed is a steady decline in the quality of the food and service as I remember the days when both were quite reliable. I can easily say that this used to be my "go-to" Mexican restaurant in Singapore, but that is sadly not the case anymore. So when I happened to be in Holland Village, I figured I'd go back to one of the few places that has been around in Holland V for quite some time. I had the chicken tortilla soup and steak fajitas. Chicken tortilla soup was ok even though it tasted like it had been sitting around for a while though but food wise there wasn't any problems with it - it's a fairly straightforward dish and quite hard to screw up. The fajitas on the other hand were very disappointing; completely overseasoned beef (couldn't make out the spice but it completely overpowered the beef) with a bunch of wet and soggy onions on the hot plate. I had requested the beef to be cooked medium; that request seemed to have fallen on deaf ears as it was cooked well done. The service here is really what I found to be the worst part about dining here. While they are extremely attentive at refilling your water -my glass never went empty for long and I never needed to ask for a refill- you'll sit there for an eternity unless you stick your hand up to get them to come take your order or clear your plates. And even when ordering, there isn't any asking how one would like their beef fajitas cooked which I found strange (not like it mattered in the end anyway). Wait staff also came across as robotic and indifferent. A smile or two would help them immensely
5
My family of five … each of us picky eaters … all agree that Cha Cha Cha in Holland Village Singapore is a great place to dine. I always get the chimichangas, they are superb! The rest of my family enjoys the tacos, burritos, even the salads! Strong margaritas, mexican food … best in Singapore! We eat here at least once a month, in fact were here for Mothers Day
1
Although I've had some decent combo plates here in years past, more recent visits have resolved me to never return. Ordered some "beef" fajitas last night that in no way resembled or tasted like beef. Instead of the expected smoking pan of peppers and onions, a pile of gloppy horse or dog meat, topped with pickled jalapenos
1
Had New year family lunch at Cha cha cha, attracted by the overflowing place. The morose and unhappy waitress, listlessly guided us to an interior table. The restaurant smells unclean inside, and my first reaction was to leave. Unwisely decided to stay, misguided by the sheer number of diners, equating it to quality of food..The sad experience has made me make my first vow of 2014. never return to this sad parody of Mexican food. Our Tequila Sunrise was probably a premixed version. The Quesadillas were cold, listless and appeared partially cooked. Burritos were served with the rice, bean sauce etc. laid out separately, without being rolled up or cooked. Bean sauce was stale and tasteless. Do not order Burritos here, is my advice. Saving grace and the only warm dish, made fresh was the fajitas.Returning here is out of the question and will avoid the entire overrated Holland village area in the future. Am happy with Boat quay and Clark quay restaurants. Best piping hot fresh Quesadillas are served at Dallas at boat quay.The very fact that this is a 20 year old restaurant, and surviving with such middling food and worse service, is testimony to the absence of Mexican food quality standards and taste, in Singapore
1
Came here and decided to try cha cha cha instead of the Mexican shop beside. Tried the other shop and was extremely happy with the food and why not. Cha cha cha won't be far off since both shops are beside each other. But man it was horrible. Lousy food lousy service. Price so darn high for such a small portion. Server didn't place our order and when I reminded her server just shrug it off and did not come out with a proper apology or anything. Worst off, the food that was not placed was the food she recommended. So please go to the next door restaurant. You won't be disappointed.

Alarm bells should have been ringing when walking into a Mexican restaurant named after a Cuban dance. This place however was packed, surely all these people couldn’t be wrong…Imagine the end result of buying a bag of the lowest quality, factory processed Nacho's available, driving over the bag in an apisonadora before opening and serving to paying guests. Inedible crumbs of anemic refuse. The salsa and guacamole accompaniment were equally as bland, however it would be unfair to expect much more from food we fast realized was simply emptied out of a packet in the 'kitchen'. Expectations were not high, and we certainly were not salivating in the expectation of arrival of our Cena. Cha Cha Cha didn’t disappoint. There is no need to fully describe the main event suffice to say that without exception NOTHING was made fresh - tortilla's (packet), refried beans (tin), shredded chicken (jar), all washed down with their famous Margarita (green high-fructose corn syrup pre-mix) which could have only been improved with a large slug of Laudanum.When you’ve experienced authentic, well made, restaurant quality Mexican food and can appreciate its colorful, rich, stimulating, feast of flavors you have to conclude that the lazy, lifeless, depressing offerings at Cha Cha Cha are unacceptable. Is there not a Mexican embassy in Singapore with a cultural responsibility to monitor these things? If not, what else are they doing? As for the atmosphere - this is Holland Village on a Friday night, how can you possibly screw this up? Sure it was busy, however what about the authentic atmosphere? Perhaps a well decorated bar with a range of good quality Tequila (think again...), or how about some colorful art work to give that authentic Aztec feel (white washed walls...), or even some Mariachi music to liven the mood (kids American cartoons playing on the TV...) I could go on, however I'm sure you get the picture by now. Seems no matter how poor the food, cocktails, service, decor or hygiene these places will survive and prosper in Singapore. The only thing I can hope is that more people get wise to these pretenders overcharging for this instantly forgettable mediocrity; the only thing I can promise is that the only time I would ever return to Cha Cha Cha would be during Los Dias de los Muetes, and this only to bid adios…thank goodness we were in good company
5
A little Mexican rest in the bustling Holland Village, atmosphere is great. Been here 3x in the last 1.5 year and am always a fan. I am not from America hence I am not sure how 'authentic' it is however the food is full of flavour everytime. To me and my friends it was all good all the way from its nachos, burrito, tortilla, chimicanga to margaritas. Value for money too
4
It's located in Holland Village.
I came on Friday night and it's packed with youngsters. It was about 9pm, so the queuing was quite short. Just needed 10 minutes to get a table for 2 of us.
My favorite dishes are burritos, quesadillas and chimichangas.
3
Cha Cha Cha's food is good in the sense that you'll probably enjoy the meal, but it is a far cry from being authentic. Perhaps I'm biased as I love beef-based Mexican food, and this restaurant does not do beef dishes well. Portions seem to have shrunk a little since we've come here a few times over the past year, especially the nacho's plate has shrunk substantially. Sour cream can be pretty dry and lumpy on some days, seems to be completely random.The setting of the restaurant is pretty nice and atmosphere is good in the later hours. Service is good and friendly but nothing special, clearly kids working their temp jobs. Plus side is plates will be brought to your table really quite quickly after ordering. Cha Cha Cha is not one of the best Mexican places I've been to, but due to the lack of quality Mexicon joints in Sg this may as well be your place of choice if you really have a craving for it
4
My friend took me to this place. Did not have any expectations as we left for this place. But as we got there I was welcomed by the festive atmosphere in holland village. Cha cha cha is surrounded by many other joints. This place looks just like the Mexican places we see in the movies. The margaritas are amazing. The nachos were heavenly. The burritos were great. Overall a great place to hang out with friends n family.
4
Great food, good and creative setting and suitable location. It can be easily reachable from Holland Village MRT. The waiting is short and quick, they will whisk you to a table in a matter of few minutes. The food is very authentic and well flavored. I recommend the chicken tortillas and the margaeritas for drinks. Not the best representation of Mexican cuisine but comes fairly close. Very friendly settling- like in 1980s Havana. The staff could have been more cordial and not so hasty

This is a small open air restaurant in the middle of Holland Village. There are not many true Mexican restaurants in Sngapore and this one has a good selection on the menu for all. The service was efficient and friendly. They also have a nice selection of margaritas which were great. The food was ample although one of the entrees had some chicken that was tough. The restaurant is very casual. Suitable for groups, families or just friends. Not suitable for special occassions other then a casual birthday, etc

3 of us went and had a good meal. Service was very quick and friendly. My friend even had a veg fajita and really enjoyed. We got a pitcher of mixed margaritas and each had 2 full glasses. Great atmosphere in Holland V for Friday night. The restaurant and surroundings was buzzing which blended well. Price was reasonable. 3 main courses with a pitcher was $120 of which the pitcher was $40. Overall I would go back for mexican food and the atmosphere

This place feels like a Mexican restaurant should feel: not too fancy, open air, and in a festive area. The frozen margarita had ample tequila, somewhat surprising for Singapore. Finally, the service was outstandingly attentive without being overbearing; it was almost like being back in the US.On the negative side, neither my wife's chalupa nor my burrito really resembled anything you would find at a Mexican restaurant across the Pacific. Additionally, the elapsed time from the second we finished giving our orders until the time the food ended up on our table could not have been more than five minutes. I'm not saying the food was all premade, but it was either that or microwaved, or both. That being said, it still tasted halfway decent.If you're searching for the best Mexican restaurant in Singapore, you won't find it here. If you're searching for a decent spot to have a Margarita and chill, it hits the spot. I almost gave it stars, but the location and atmosphere does really provide that laid back vibe

We just had a lovely meal at Cha Cha Cha's restaurant tonight where we have eaten before and have thoroughly enjoyed. The service was excellent and food good as usual but I was really dissapointed in finding a staff member smoking in 1 of the 2 only toilets available to patrons. There were 4 patrons waiting to use the toilet and 2 people actually had to leave the premises to use other toilet facilities as they were waiting so long. Lucky the other toilet became available for a little child in front of me or I am sure she may have had an accident, her father had to come in enquiring after her after such a long wait. When I eventually got into the toilet that the staff member was occupying it was full of smoke and the cigarette butt was floating in the toilet. This is totally unacceptable and management need to do something about it as I did express my concerns

Very hard to get good, quality Mexican food in Singapore. The food at cha cha cha is pretty good, and should satisfy your Mexican cravings. The atmosphere in Holland Village is great at night and, like other restaurants on the street, you can choose to dine inside or outside. Expatriates and visitors from North America may be familiar with Mexican food being more economical and will likely be surprised by the prices at cha cha chaâ€¦ very expensive, especially when compared to other dining options in Singapore

Okay, we are a little biased. And live 120km from Mexico. So our standards are higher than most reviewing Mexican fare. This was a decent Mexican Cantina, however some authentic ingredients were very notably absent in some dishes. And certain types of food, Mexican for example, are generally low-priced alternative dining options. Cha was very expensive in this regard. A decent cantina atmosphere, good drinks, so-so food authenticity.

This is proper mexican from the dips when you arrive through to the Jalapenos and great Fajitas washed down with real frozen Margaritas to wipe you out time and time again.
I cant face another mexican in Singapore after this one

We went on a Friday night and although the place was full, we soon found a table and were seated. Holland Village area is a really nice place to hang out at on weekends and the stretch where Cha Cha Cha is located was bustling! The guacamole and sour cream comes in abundance with each dish. We had the appetizer of fried jalapeno peppers and I highly recommend it!!! The chicken quesadillas were excellent, plenty of melted cheese inside! The beef fajitas were tasty but too oily and came with 3 wraps. The meats were swimming inside a hot plate of grease. The prawn enchiladas were the highlight of the evening!!! They were delicious! The place has a very rustic feel and decor. The service was prompt and attentive. We did not order any drinks. The total bill came upto about $25 to $30 per head, which I think is decent in the Holland Village area. The restaurant has a wall mounted TV that plays Tom and Jerry which was nice since we had a toddler with us

Great food but horrible service. My family went out to Cha Cha Cha's on May 17th at 1pm. The restaurant wasn't crowded but the service was horrible. We had to ask for the complimentary chips and salsa, twice, the food took forever to come out I mean at least 20 minutes for the appetizer.... To top it all off, my husband ordered a beer on tap, and when he went to take a sip from it, the bottom of the glass slid off. The beer spilled all over him and everywhere. We never received an apology, and they had the nerve to try to charge us for the beer. There wasn't even an offer to pay for the dry cleaning bill for his pants, shirt and my dress. I will never go there again, or recommend it as I have in the past

Okay, so maybe Tex Mex is not really authentic "Mexican" food, but I love the Tex Mex at this place. The complimentary chips and salsa is a good start, and they have a good variety on their menu. I like the fact that they offer the option of seasoned ground beef in their tacos, which the competing Mexican restaurants in Singapore unfortunately don't (others offer only shredded or grilled beef). Service wasn't stellar the first time I went, but the service is very good now that they recognize me. The Margarita's and other drinks are excellent, and the place is overall good value

Average mexican food,where's the spicy factor? and what is up with their service, definately no such thing as service with a smile, just because I didn't order booze like the table next to mine. Don't bother going to this place, cafe iguana's nicer
