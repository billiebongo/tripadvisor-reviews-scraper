Good quality ingredients with an impressive lineup of desserts - we had this interesting mochi which looks like a tiny watermelon. Grilled meats were also really good - especially Iberico Pork

Great place to have dinner with good service staffs and Ali the manager is very nice and kind! Will definitely go back to support them!
1
Food is very small portion,limited selection,slow Service,burnt fish and the pork is not properly cook as well
5
Was very nice experience. Good food. Cozy place and very professional staff (Ali!) definitely recommend that place

the food was not refill. We had to ask for the seafood to be refill twice. We also asked for the prawn to be refill and yet after half an hour it was still not refill. The manager came over and apologize and inform that they will refill but it was still not done. When they came over to inform us last order, we told them that the prawn was not refill. And finally they bring a big plate of prawn over when we are going to pay the bill soon. So what's the point? And we overheard 2 people in front of us asking for the ice cream but was informed that it has finished. I believed for the price we pay for a hotel buffet, it should be better than this. If everything is either finished or not refill, might as well don't call it buffet.

Walking about Singapore hungry after a long walk but yet again overawed by the choice of restaurants. The beach street kitchen looked really inviting and so we went in for lunch. The waiting staff were attentive and incredibly helpful but not instrusive. The buffet lunch was incredible both in choice and in quality. Chef Jason and his team have worked incredibly hard to create a buffet that pays homage to Singaporean dishes but is inclusive of international tastes. The seafood was amazin

Food was excellent and the service was great. Have not seen any service like this elsewhere in other  buffet restaurants.Not my first visit to Beach Road Kitchen but my second with the family. First time was during lunch and this time,i came to try the dinner spread with my wife and daughter.My daughter really liked the satay she had before and asked for the satay station but unfortunately the chef said that satay was only served for lunch and not dinner. A kind , sweet looking lady chef by the name of Hazyrah actually prepared a small portion of satay for my daughter. She has definitely made my daughters day and i am very thankful .Not only that after dinner she came by to check on us , asked for feedback and if theres anything else we needed.Water was constantly being refilled without even asking & service staff were always attentive.I am definitely coming back again

Seafood was fresh enough and the foie gras was good! Truffle pizza is one of my favourite. Lobster and oysters were juicy and fresh especially the salmon sashimi, my mum loves it alot. Told the manager in charge Mr Ali that it’s my mum birthday today and ask for a slice of cake. He offered us a birthday cake and bring his team along to sing birthday song. Thumbs up for this! Not forget to mention a chinese young girl and a boy with specs serve us well! Excellent service! :)

Went with colleagues. Nice environment. Value for money. Service was good and the range of food was good as well

My wife and I had lunch at Beach Road Kitchen on our most recent visit. This restaurant is part of the relatively new JW Marriott Hotel.There is a very good selection of buffet items of excellent quality. The staff are especially warm and welcoming.Whatever you do, save some room for their desserts!A great choice for lunch or dinner
5
This is a very high quality buffet restaurant. The usual seafood spread are there and they are quite impressive. The traditional local food they made are excellent and much better than the hawker food I ate the night before in Newton Center. Except for the street food experience, I could have eaten the same in JW Marriott tonight. The service is fantastic. I hate plates piling up in any buffet setting. The wait staff here cleared my used plates and glasses immediately. The manager addressed me by name because I made a reservation. A nice touch. Both the pastry chef Edwin and executive chef Sid cannot be nicer. Overall it was a great experience
4
Stayed at the JW Marriott Singapore for 10 days and had 9 breakfasts here. Many many breakfast food options, so it would be difficult not to be highly satisfied with whatever one is trying to find. Staff is attentive and polite. However, the place can be chaotic depending on when everyone in hotel decides to eat. Earlier or later in am is better on weekends or if hotel is full.
5
Excellent service is a rare phenomenom these days and it deserves being highlighted. The experience when we visited Beach Road Kitchen for lunch today was wonderful and we were pleasantly delighted in many ways. Ms. Wing, the hostess that brought us to our table, was very professional and lovely. We had initially reserved a table for 8 persons, but had to increase it to 10 persons when we arrived. She accommodated our last-minute request very graciously, even though the restaurant was fully booked. Our server, Ms. Julia, together with her colleagues, were attentive and highly efficient, refilling our water and clearing dishes promptly and regularly, despite the restaurant being completely full. They were also very enthusiastic in their work. Cooks and chefs at various stations were very courteous and warm.We did not inform that one of our diners was celebrating his birthday, but one of the servers overheard and prepared a birthday cake to surprise him. Food-wise, it was pretty standard buffet fare, but slightly elevated and more refined. Some dishes were more forgettable than others. It was, however, the incredible service that made the entire experience a very memorable one. The Management at Beach Road Kitchen is doing something very right and their level of service should be made exemplary.

One of the Best Buffet Restaurant I have ever been ! Service is extremely great !The food are so fresh ! Btw. The restaurant is extremely cold especially when it is raining
4
Great breakfast buffet spread. The restaurant is really pretty inside. Quite busy every time I go. Food is really good. The only negative is every cup of coffee I've ordered is barely room temperature? And it's made per order...so not sure why this is the case.For lunch/dinner the menu is VERY expensive
5
We booked coupons to Christmas Day Dinner Buffet. As we were roaming around the place, we lost track of time and only managed to come to the dinner around 9, which gave us barely 1hour to enjoy their amazing spread of cuisines. They welcome in and informed us that we only have close to hour and showed us to our seating area. When we went to the pizza area, staff was kind enough to suggest us that it will be easier and quicker for us, if we simply serve everything we want to eat first and then start our dinner and the lady in the pizza table was kind enough to guide us through the huge spread of cuisines and wait till we serve ourselves. without her, we would definitely miss out the amazing seafood spread and cheese tasting area!We had an amazing rush-dinner for little longer than 1hour dinner (had to eat up, leaving the small talks to later) and they were kind enough to stay open till we serve our desserts and finish it off, without rushing us. Food was sooo Good we end up eating wayyyyy too much, which kept us both awake for awhile. Oyster was amazing! Thank you so much for the amazing Christmas Buffet, for your patience and perfect service. Totally worth the money and i am glad we picked Beach road kitchen, instead of Akira Back. So if you want a variety of cuisines, rather than just one, and want to feel like "money well spent", this is a restaurant you MUST NOT skip!
5
There’s lot of choice food in this restaurant. The staffs are friendly and helpful, definitely will return especially for family occasions
2
Oysters were very thin, too salty.Variety was very limited.Certain items were delicious like the salted egg chicken and the black pepper crab but that's where the goodness ends.Only has water and hot tea for beverages, and the cheese area stank and there was even a fly in the area.Absolutely waste of mone

Really enjoyed the food and services here, together with my family. Especially really appreciate for first-class and friendly service of Ally :

Today we decided to celebrate mum’s birthday at Beach Road Kitchen, based on a friend’s recommendation. Love the food and the environment, great services, really nice for chill out with friends or family. Manager Ali invited all the chefs to sing a birthday song to my mum, which make my mum so happy. Thanks to manager Ali for the arrangement! Will definitely come again for our next gathering.
5
Well served by Waiter: Nadia.
The food selections was good. Like the dessert spread and the cold cut.
5
Went to Beach Road Kitchen on 29th December 2017. Was very impressed with the antipasti selection & the generous offering of oysters. Grilled fish & Iberico pork was simply great, very well seasoned. did not manage to try out the full spread. We took the free flow prosecco & wine package. the red wine was a bit disappointing though. could have better quality reds. No complaints on the prosecco.All the service staff were excellent, being very attentive & prompt. Did not take down their names except for the manager Mr Ali who was also very helpful.Will certainly be back very soon to try out all the wide spread 
5
Last Friday night I had a group party @ ur hotel. Very impressive ambience and the buffet was delicious.Over all the setup is great. While I was enjoying my food we were waiting for tea and coffee which Took a while to get to us. A big thanks to Sunil who helped me to follow up on the delay and serve me tea/ coffee. Great service guys, really enjoyed the evening @ your place

Celebrated christmas recently with my girlfriend and this is One of the best buffet ive ever been to with a wide range of food to choose from. Quality of food are also top notch and freshest. Heard from the chefs that most of the ingredients are imported from overseas! The salad section amazed me with their freshness and variety. Appetising to start with! The staffs there are also accommodating and friendly! Chef eddie helped explain some of the cold dishes and also brought me around the whole buffet line because he saw that i was so lost with all the variety. Extra mile effort! The grill section serves the best foie gras and freshest fishes! Me alone ate three grilled fishes that day! Thank you once again for making our celebration a great one! See you soon
5
First visit and it was an enjoyable experience. The food varieties were excellent. My only comment will be it will be good to see some local favourites too like satay, durian puree.The service was top notch. The crews were attentive. Like to compliment Naffis in particular and i will likely visit the restaurant again. Great jobs guys

I would like to commend Mr. Mathan and the other staff of Beach Road Kitchen for an unforgettable and memorable experience. Mr Mathan displayed exemplary initiative and took special care to make my family and I feel like honored guests of this establishment, always taking care to ask if "you wanted a drink or refill?" or if we "needed any assistance?". He definitely went beyond his call of duty, when he even went to help us pre-order a plate of 4 pieces of Foie Gras! To add the icing to the cake, he even sang a birthday song for me personally! This is what the service sector in Singapore should take note of, Mr Mathan being a paragon of excellence for others to emulate. In a nutshell, the food and variety presented was of an extremely high standard, but what really stood out for me, was the personal touch of the service staff in the restaurant! - Michae

Came here for a birthday celebration. It’s an international buffet dinner. Food spread was plenty. Seafood were fresh. Counter food was prepared after they were ordered. Staff were extremely friendly, especially Muhammad Ali and Kenny. Would highly recommend this place.
5
Came here for my mums birthday on a Saturday night. Ambience was great. Food was great. Customer service was excellent. An international buffet with lots of counter to order food such as foie gras, pompret, lamb chop, ribs, and steak. The staff were extremely helpful and polite. Everything about this place is great. Would definitely come again.
4
The spread is as advertised - international and local fare, with a grill stations, a variety of seafood, and for people with a sweet tooth, a wide selection of desserts. However, the staff serving the food could be better trained - the oysters were full of shell shards from improper shucking, and the prime rib was butchered by the carver so, resulting in weird chunks instead of proper slices.
5
This was a surprise on many levels. Imagined as a seafood buffet we were pleasantly surprised to find several stations offering so much more - curries, laksa bar, rice, pizza bar, side of lamb and beef ribs, grill station where whole fish can be grilled, salads, cheeses and meats, and of course desserts of every kind. Topped off with great service and attention from staff - big thanks to Edwin who showed us around and explained it all. It seems pricey but worth it as we spent 3 hours there. Good for kids too. Drinks are extra pricey but we didn't feel the need really as the food was enough. Do try it. Easy access for prams or wheelchair too. 
4
Good food, good atmosphere and very good service. We were impressed with the level of service provided, especially from Ali, the restaurant's AM and Naffis. We like the fresh seafood selection, though not impressed with the oysters served last night. We loved the grilled fish live station which offers seabream and seabass, and grilled by order. We also took up the free-flow wine option. Overall, this meal costed us around SGD300

Being part of JW Marriot in Singapore, this restaurant serves excellent Buffet Breakfast till 1030am in the morning every day. The Restaurant is a very large, modern open kitchen concept and is designed for a buffet spread. The Restaurant is open for Breakfast, Lunch, Afternoon Tea as well as Dinner. It is a Multi-cuisine Restaurant for breakfast, serving Cereals, Pan Cakes, Bread, Pastries, Fruits, Salads, Gourmet Cheese and Meat cuts. It also serves a large variety of hot food suitable for Japanese, Chinese, Indian, Malay, Vegetarian and Vegan customers. The place also serves all kinds of Fresh Juices, Yogurt, Drinks for breakfast along with tea/ coffee. The Spread is laid out in such a large area that you will need at-least 10 extra mins to understand the layout of all the foods, so come with ample time in hand to enjoy this place. The Breakfast hostess/ host are very professional and you should get a table in less then a min as this place is huge, so try to take a table close to the food counters if you are in a hurry. Beware of the local service staff who can sometimes behave rudely, if you ask anything special or at your table. Try and get whatever you want via the Managers who are most co-operative and helpful. I was served by Ms. Ritvika who was most courteous and helpful.The price of the Breakfast is approx S$50 incld Tax which i felt was a little steep for the place, but then the ambiance and the food makes it all up if you want to enjoy a special morning out with your loved ones

My family, 17 of us celebrated my mum's 80th birthday. The food was good, Wide selection of choices. Staff were helpful and friendly. Nice ambience.This is my 2nd time visit to the restaurant. I would not hesitate to introduce Beach Road Kitchen to anyone who wishes to go for buffet 
3
AMBIENCE was nice.I have to compliment Staff Raven.When I reached the restaurant, I said I would like to see the spread first.She gave us a tour and show us the buffet spread.She is very smiley and pleasant.There were 3 Indian waiters and 1 chinese waitress who seemed like training students.The Chinese waitress who was discharged of my table,did not pour water for us after 5minutes,when I helped myself,she was a little awakens.We had to placed our used plates on the side station many a times.Restaurant was about 30% full.Grill station was good.Foie Grad with fig dressing was amazing. However, the fresh seafood consisting of crab,snow crab,prawns oysters were not fresh. Though there was a chef who was opening the shell of the oysters,out of 6, all were dead,3 had a foul taste.The boiled prawns were tough and the Sri Lankan boiled crab had a pungent chemical taste. The snow crab was ok.There was a wide selection of cold salad spread and appetizers,the salmon roulette was quite yummy.Only 2 types of sashimi featured.Salmon and tuna.Both tasted quite dry.Truffles Oil drizzled pizza was over rated. Chilly Crab had a pungent chemical taste,but the fried buns was very tasty.Overall, not worth the visit,because the seafood selection was not fresh
5
Beach Road Kitchen did a fine job of getting diners into a celebratory mood -- with excellent food tastefully displayed and a magician entertaining guests. Also included was a complimentary photo taking session for table guests.Excellent service led by the very capable Captain Ali makes this restaurant into a must visit place.Thanks for a great evening

i went in jul/aug previously and the food was great. i went back in dec and there’s a slight deterioration in the food taste. truffle pizza was disappointing.. wondering if coz the main chef was not around? hardly any mushroom in it. there’s no scallop cerviche TT.. and the aircon water was dripping on me the whole night.. overall i still think its good taste as i appreciated the quality of food and service staff were attentive enough though it would be good if they can it consistent and upkeep their maintenace of the place. i expect certain standards as they are charging a premium under the Marriott brand.
5
The service was excellent. I would like to say a big thank you to the waiter, Joel, for his excellent service. He always put a smile on his face. In addition , he was very prompt to our needs without having to make any requests!

We were a party of 6 for lunch. At first impression, the place looked lovely. Perfect for our ladies gathering. The anti-pasti section, the selection of anti-pasti was wide and was rather impressive. Cold seafood is rather pathetic, only prawns and cold crab. Available are the tuna and salmon tartare. The Tuna tartare is pretty good but the salmon tartare wasn't fresh so the stink of fishness came through. The carpaccios are only salmon. Try out the other anti pasti if you can, they are good.This is a first time a buffet served micro greens and fresh salad leaves that you can cut so that was an awesomely nice touch. The hot foods are standard fares, nothing exceptional. Laksa station is DIY, so you select what ever ingredients you want. At the grills and roast station were, turkey, pork roast, lamb and other grilled meats. What is extremely disappointing was, when my friend asked for beef, she was served a delightful soft rib, well marinated and cooked perfectly. When another friend approached them for beef, she was rebuffed that beef wasn't served that day. So I'm not sure now if what we ate was beef. Tim Sum section were only baos in all four steamers. Siew mai and ha gao only came out towards the end of the buffet serving time.Desserts were nicely done, there's pancakes and waffles available at request and both soft serve and individual ice cream cups hidden in the non label fridge were a treat. Every guest was allow one serving of soft drinks and/or a free flow of coffee and/or tea. For SGD68 per pax, we were a little disappoint with the quality of food and the lack of staff. If you are expecting proper service like plates being cleared when you are done. This is not the place to dine

I was very disappointed. Went for Sat buffet in early Dec with my grp of 4, to celebrate an occasion, after hearing gd reviews. -BBQ station: Ran out of fresh fish for bbq by 7.20pm! lamb was gd but a pity not all of us eat lamb. -Dessert station: ran out of ice cream tubs a looong time ago. No refills available. i asked 2 diff staff about refills and 1 look rather irritated (probably because he's been asked many times). Waffle was dense (not light and airy) and taste so-so, with average condiments. the desserts were in glass cabinets with doors, which looks gd but is not efficient for a buffet setting because they were very difficult to access. somehow the remaining cakes were disappointing too. which was sad because i always look fwd to gd dessert spreads.-Cold seafood room: similar narrow, tight fitting lanes which were very crowded and difficult to walk. need to wait/Q. The range of cold seafood was wide but alot of items were v slow to refill as well. Eg the razor clams row of seafood and sashimi were always out of stock too. The oysters were tiny and freq out of stock. the lobster tails were of cos freq out of stock. We asked for nut/crab crackers but there werent enough. 4 of us were sharing 1, and then when i went to get more food, a waitress just said 'we need that' and took it away from our table. she was informing us, not asking us. The crab legs/lobster claws were very hard and impossible to crack without tools. -Deli/salad counter: The range of cheese/ham/salami and the salad condiments were disappointing too. but there was a leg of parma ham to shave so that was the gd thing.-coffee/tea at end of meal was nice. many part-time waitresses which were gd as they were quite ready to refill water/clear plates. overall disappointing for a supposed high end buffet. maybe my expectations were raised by the gd reviews. Or perhaps the early Dec wkend crowd was bigger than expected. Price was $78 after discount credit card promotion.i contacted the hotel to feedback and they replied politely. perhaps by now they've adjusted to the crowd

Seafood was fresh and desserts were awesome. Staff were all very friendly and would like to thank the manager Ali for his excellent service.
4
Good ambience and although service staff are limited but appreciate that they have tried their best to accommodate our requests. Food is good.
5
Came for dinner with family and friends, the food and drink were excellent and very reasonably priced, but more importantly Mr Ali the manager, and Raffis the super, made sure everything was perfect...Outstanding Sevice, will definitely come back!!
5
We’ve been there a few times for lunch, this time we went for dinner... outstanding service and the food was delicious as always !!! Mr. Ali and Mr. Naffis were the extra mile for us, definitely we’ll come again
4
Excellent service. Big thanks to Vincent who looked after our table. Decent range of dishes that satisfies a demand for variety but not too extensive to be overwhelming. Nice seafood from the cold room; great truffle pizzas; fresh ha kows (prawn dumplings). Well organised buffet.While the dessert range was good, the quality isn't. We sampled all of them but didn't enjoy any. The kids liked the ice-cream though
2
Went for the lunch buffet with my 17 months baby and requested for another table nearer to the window (we felt it was safer for the kid to sit inside) but the waitress claimed that it has been reserved by another guest without even checking. However, the seats were not occupied even till the end of our lunch buffet. Requested for the use of family room restroom to change my kid’s diaper but it was locked and the staff say they do not have the key. Went over to the hotel lobby toilet but there isn’t any diaper changing room as well.
5
Came here with a group of old friends for an end year dinner! What a great choice it was! Great ambience, good array of food, wonderful service! Special commendation to Jessie at the dessert section for her special attention and going the extra mile to help me get my sesame ice cream from the storage! Super blessed!
2
...although asking for email and mob when making the reservation over the phone, they had not registered it. Luckily, a table was available. Some staff seem pretty clueless. Food was ok considering this is a 5 star hotel, but cannot compare with Edge at Pan Pacific. There are much better options in town considering the high price, ok food selection and very mixed service experience
5
This restaurant had a refreshing buffet spread. It wasn't the biggest selection but they sure do serve quality dishes. The BBQ lamb chops & beef were delicious! 3 lamp chops & 3 pieces of foie gras will be worth the buffet price. The BBQ sole fish and rainbow trout were quite good too. We love the pizza which was baked on spot. Plenty of oysters and cold seafood choices. However i think the oysters are too salty, not sure if it is normal or soaked in sea water/salt water.Do ask for foie gras which is free flow and no one mentions it until we had paid our bills. The waiter quickly arranged some foie gras for our table. We liked the waffle, crepes and pancake station. They made some of them ready for us and all remained warm and crispy.Overall it was a good buffet with every 2nd pax 50% discount. So we will go there again soon
1
I waited patiently for my table despite my horror at the snaking queue.... only to be brought on a wild goose chase to find a table by one of the staff. end up no table can be found, we were left at the door again!! Another staff came along and rushed us to a messy table assuming I'm a PRC and don't understand her English... what an insult! Utterly disappointing experience!
3
Had Christmas Eve lunch with Family..we are regular at Edge, Pan-Pacific but decided to give it a try for a change.I guess the most unpleasant part of the restaurant was a young Chinese lady staff to receive the guest upon arrival(12:20pm),No politeness, no smile, no greeting until I approached to smile at her to say hello, getting distracted with someone else...Very raw attitude which u won’t see in other staffs...But a young gentleman who was new working there had fantastic professional manner with warm smile, politeness throughout our dining....Food spread is ok but the dessert spread wasn’t that great. What I liked the most was the ambience and the design of the whole building.I would not want to go back until the management works on improving the delivering consistent service, especially welcoming the guest
3
Definitely a perfect ambience to catch up with friends over a meal. However, the speed of replenishment of food can be improved. My thousand island dressing took quite a long while to arrive and I didn't get to have my ice cream
3
First up, the trout fish and the pizza was my fav. But the experience that I had was a little disappointing. Service was a little slow, it would be good if servers/staff can be a little more attentive. Lastly there were flies on the cheese at the cheese bar.
5
Pleasantly surprised we could get a table on walk-in because they were full house for reservations when we called.Buffet separated into various categories like seafood, meat grill etc. What really got my attention was the quality of food. Most buffet ranges have a couple of good dishes and the rest are mediocre. I’m happy to announce that all the buffet items i had are top notch. The seafood selection has a really good variety, and the wonderful laksa station is super duper yummy.Received a birthday cake with best wishes from the staff. Shoutout to Ali and Flora for their excellent service and hospitality
5
Thank you Vincent ans his dedicated team for giving us good service when we visited the beach road kitchen on 21 Dec 17. You are professional and attentive to our need
2
I went there for a dinner with some colleagues. The food was ok but the service was really bad. Some of the mine colleagues waited the ordered meal for more than an hour. At the end, after complaining the manager offered the late dishes. Anyway, in the overall, the experience there was horrible. I strongly suggest to avoid this place, it looks like a luxury and fancy place but, in my experience, the service was worse than a cheap place!
5
Love this place, place is done up very well. Food presentation and variety was there. Quality of the food and taste very high, would definitely be back
4
Went to this restaurant for xmas dinner with my colleagues on a tuesday. Good seafood spread with fresh oysters, crabs, prawns, etc. There are other stations that serve grilled items like beef, pork, lamb, fish, foie gras, noodles, salad, chinese food, indian food, and of course desserts. I didn't manage to try everything on offer as the spread was just so wide.Quality was good. I particularly like the grilled items like rack of lamb and beef. The staff were busy as the restaurant was quite packed even on a tuesday but it's evident they try their best to serve. A staff named Naflis (hopefully I got his name right) even helped us to get the dessert spoons when we told him the dessert station ran out of these spoons and recommended us what food to go after.The price per pax at $78+++ is a bit steep but this was partly offset by the offer of 50% off every second pax, which makes the price more palatable for such a wide spread
4
My family enjoyed the dinner very much, in particular the crabs and lobsters. The grilled iberico pork and short ribs were excellent too. All in all, an amazing spread of food
3
Tried Sunday brunch. Food spread is normal, not worth $108++/pax. Oysters were not fresh & very salty. Cold lobster tasted bland. Latte were served in lukewarm condition, much below expectation.
5
Visited the restaurant and was treated really well by Ali and another female waitress. Food was good, and service was quick - would definitively recommend
4
 Very wide International spread but certain food can be improved like the Chawanmushi, it was rather salty and only had very few ingredients in it, the Chicken curry & Kwey Teow was bland otherwise the rest was pretty goo
4
It has a variety of stations from fresh seafood to local delights, to variety of grilled fish and meat selections. It’s not as many compared to other buffet but I would say enough to suit the taste buds of any food enthusiast. Quality of food and service is also superb
5
The restaurant offers good food, friendly staff and cosy atmosphere. There were sufficient food variety to appeal to all palate
3
The layout was cramped and foods was so so. Manpower was not enough and run out of utensils . Replenish of items were slo
4
I brought friends from Shanghai there for their buffet dinner. It’s not cheap but the spread is very good. The seafood is well stocked and they make a very good roast beef. We enjoyed ourselves and will be back
5
What a spread of BBQ top grade meats, fish, fresh prawns, pizzeria, anti pasti & great service! Woah

We booked a table for a birthday. Someone opted for the buffet (78 GSD in mid-week days, more towards the weekend), others decided to pick a dish from the menu. The first problems started with the beers. We ordered a few, and after 10' we were still waiting. Then the waitress told us that one type of (tap) beer was no longer available, and asked to choose another one. We waited for (at least) other 20'. Asked again and after a few more minutes we got our beers, but one, which did not come if not after other four requests and only at the end of the dinner. The dishes from the menu also arrived something like 50' after the order, and two diners waited for more than one hour. To be fair, the director apologized for the mishap and waived the cost of the late beer and dishes, which was appreciated. However, the pleasure of the social dinner was at that time already (partially) wasted. Who opted for the buffet had a better experience, since the quality of the food was more than ok and the price was reasonable. It could have been a pleasant dinner, if not for the really terrible service (also, the collection of the empty plates from the buffet customers was very slow, with the result that the dirty plates got stacked in the middle of the table, not very pleasant)
5
The high reviews given on here was what prompted me to visit this restaurant while on vacation from Vancouver and I was impressed.Seafood and sashimi selections were fresh and abundant including swordfish, octopus and oysters Great mix of chinese, indian and western cuisine to keep things interesting along with an excellent BBQ grilled meat and seafood section that I frequented more than the other sections.Last but not least, the service aspect. To me, great service is what makes the food even enjoyable and Ryan did exactly that for me. He always made sure to check how I was doing from time to time and made sure my table was always ready for the next meal. He also took the time to recommend me their signature dessert dish which was the tiramisu and it was no joke. Especially in a very busy buffet type setting with multiple tables to wait on, typically a lot of restaurants would tend to focus on the efficiency aspect and drop the quality service as theres pressure to turn over for the next customer...but definitely not this restaurant and so I do appreciate that. I also noticed the manager walking around doing quality checks and making sure every food station is filled so no customer is left standing and waiting for a particular food item. Overall, great operation along with great food.Will definitely return

i had try out the buffet these are my review to share:1) Upon entering the restaurant, one of the guy greeted us and show us to our table (without smile) and run away very fast. he should at least intro us the buffet sector.2) When we reach our table and haven even settled down, the waiter asked what do we want to drink. it's kind of rush and how am i know what drink do you have?.3) There is no proper kids utensils when asked instead they provided me a small bowl and a small metal spoon.4) Very nice and relax ambient except there is flies around.5) Laksa without laksa leaf ??? (no, no to me) 6) The Pizza is indeed very nice, i like it so much.7) Overall food taste is Average to me.8) Lousy dessert despite there is a lot of variety. 9) when i was taking food there is a waiter walked toward me and i had to move a side to let him take his things at the cabinet below the food bar. The waiter should at least let me finish first
5
Clean and pleasant environment to dine in. The staff are friendly, attentive and helpful.Look forward to dine there every time
5
What a food spread. They cover all of the Singapore dishes for breakfast and more. Besides the American basics of eggs, sausage, waffles and fruit, they have so much more of a variety. They have Ice cream and deserts by the front checki

Went for their Xmas buffet lunch. Overall a good experience. Variety of food can be wider for the price

Went here as it was rated highly by Trip Advisor reviewers and was close to our accommodation. We were a bit disappointed by Trip Advisor reviewers but they probably had it right. We were after a quick light dinner. The BSK’s forte is an all-you-can-eat buffet for $SG88 ++. If you don’t want that, your choices are a couple of Asian stir fry / noodles, pizzas or burgers. With some trepidation, we settled on a pizza and a burger but they were really quite good. Bring your wallet, however, as the vegetarian pizza was $SG26 ++ and the burger was $SG36 ++. The buffet, which we perused before going back to our light dinner option, looked very good and extensive

Such a wonderful & memorable dining experience, totally unexpected for a buffet. We celebrated my daughter's birthday last evening. The service staff surprised her with a very yummy birthday cake and sang her a song. Really nice gesture. The ambience was good too. The food was amazing- truffle pizza, foie gras, whole grilled fish, crab legs, oysters, chocolate nibs, TWG tea, illy's coffee...Want to specially mention Naffis for his highly commendable attentive service. To the Restaurant Manager(Italian)- great job, pls keep it up
5
Probably the best buffet both in quality and value in Singapore. Service is excellent. Our server Naffis is both attentive and personal. Highly recommended restaurant
5
I was here for my birthday eve dinner celebration with my mom as it’s her first dinner buffet in Singapore. Chef Sui Thong served a cheesy macaroni to our table. My mom appreciated his attitude and foods. Lastly, it’s a great dinner buffet in JW South Beach.

We celebrated our dear friend Willie's birthday and we chose this restaurant because the food quality is fantastic and we had a good experience last time we went. Firstly the restaurant is cozy and beautifully decorated and layout not like a typical restaurant. There are cozy nooks for cold dish and desserts. It was fun to navigate around. The quality of the food is simply amazing, super fresh and some of the cold dishes done in ways you don't see in typical buffet spread. Presentation is nicely done also. Everything is so fresh and nicely done up. Jacy the F&B Director was very friendly and a very gracious host and checked in on our table from time to time to ensure that we are well taken care of. The two waiters serving our table - Mathan and Yadad were extremely attentive. They were very friendly, always smiling, ensuring that our glasses were never empty and never intrusive. They are great ambassadors for the Marriot brand of hospitality. We had a wonderful evening, a birthday celebration that was made special by the South Beach Kitchen team. Thank you and we will be back

Have visited BRK thrice and each time the food and service are perfect. The food...no where else have I seen fresh whole fish being grilled at a buffet. There are 2 choices - sea bass and pomfret, both are delicious. The seafood (salmon / tuna sashimi, clams, oysters, crabs, prawns and more) is fresh and stocked plentifully. Don't miss the laksa station. Super yummy - broth is so decadently thick and creamy. The service staff are always super pleasant and friendly and make sure to keep your plates cleared. Special thanks to Jacy, Mathan and Yadad who took care of our table of 10 two weeks ago. They ensured that our grilled fish is timely delivered, that nothing is amiss, and very importantly, our wines and drinks topped up even before they are empty :) Overall a wondeful experience - BRK is definitely one of our top go-to buffets.
5
Thank you so much for taking such wonderful care of us. You and your staff were so very accommodating. The buffet at the Bread Street Kitchen was always delicious!What a great place

Just had buffet lunch at this rather new restaurant. They have quite a variety of food, Hokkien noodle, truffle pizza, laksa, barbecue meats and selection of desserts. Staff very friendly especially Joel - very dedicated. Ambience is great but aircon not very strong. Would definitely come back again
5
Thoughtful service, tasty food, beautiful furnishings. We made use of credit card discount which was excellent value. Cold appetisers was the weakest section. Will be back!
5
the food is good. excellent service. We celebrated our colleagues bday . They provided a small std cake for our celebration. will definitely come agaim with my family members.

I would have given this review another circle if not for the bad food service.Service was excellent from the front door to the table. Waiter Joel was attentive and often checked back to see what we wanted. When he overheard from our conversation that the crab claws were not replenished, he immediately attended to it and brought us a plate. Such a service is never encountered in a buffet here in Singapore and there we have, a star wait staff who went out of his way to make his customers happy. Food was average to good. Lots of salad and deserts, the grilled pork was tender and good but the beef was tough. Cold seafood was good, prawns, crabs. I feel that the food selection was not a lot but the excellent service provided make up for it.
4
Visited the restaurant yesterday. The food is great but the seafood is a bit fishy and choices are quite limited. Despite of all that, one of the waiter, Yudav has really work hard in giving personalized services to us and most of the tables beside us. It was my boyfriend’s birthday and i have informed during the reservation but nothing has been done till he saw me giving present to my boyfriend and checked with my brother in law secretly and confirming that it’s my boyfriend’s bday. Thank you. It was a great experience. I would like to give a small suggestion as well because i notice that when he’s distributing cakes to the other tables who are having birthday as well, i notice that there’s a lack of team work between him and the other waiter and waitress. I think they all should gather and sing together instead of only having one or two of them singing softly because i know that it takes courage to do so
4
Large spread of salads, cheese, meats, cold cuts, desserts and signature dishes!Cold seafood can be improved in terms of size and variet
4
Generally very good. Staff helpful & obliging. However, slow & obvious reluctance to replenish lobsters. Slow & insufficient replenishment of cupped ice-cream
5
When we reached BRK, 1 of the BRK friendly staff walk us around with introduction of the different variety of foods.The "Jelly Fish" cold dish is among the best of the Best which I like it very much.The tiny "cup cake" dessert is also among the best of the Best.Well well well, there are other 2 diners asking the chef to reveal his tiny cup cake recipe !This place is definitely highly recommended for food lovers.Go explore yourself now
5
It was really delicious food.The food was very good quality.The service was excellent.It was relaxing night
4
This restaurant serves some lunch buffet spread which are uncommon. Tasty and fresh. Service is good
3
They have good food but server approached us if we wanted to get the bill even though we were still having good conversation
5
Had the lunch buffet. Just as with my previous visits, I enjoyed the food and service. The chilled seafood is the highlight of the meal, followed by the dessert and grilled food. Ambience is great. Service is very good (though not consistently so)
5
Visited the restaurant twice before my company DnD. Thanks to Sales manager Johnny for coordinating the event, making arrangements for a TV monitor for presentation. Good service by Wing at the counter.Wide spread of variety - Italian, live station, fresh seafood, grills, cheese selection, and DESSERT! The desserts were really awesome, jars of candies, marshmallow, jellybeans, display shelves filled with cakes, eclairs, kueh, table full of chocolate, waffles made on the spot, and soft serve yums! During my 3 times there, staffs were efficient and helpful. Definitely will be back again
5
This is my 3rd visit to the restaurant, a first time for dinner hours. I was amazed by the service despite the lack of staff during a weekday dinner. The entire service team was always moving around from table to table ensuring that the guest needs are taken care of from serving water to ushering them to the seats. The ambience at the restaurant was great, so were the fresh seafood and the live cooking station.The grill counter serves fresh sea brass and pomfret which will be freshly grilled on order too. The seafood items served at the seafood room is of huge variety with many different condiments too. The selection of wine available as part of the wine pairing is limited but of good quality. Will be back again for another visit
5
Oysters were freshly shucked on the spot, prawns and crabs were fresh and good, and be sure to save space for the fantastic desserts. Will definitely be back for more
5
We went for the dinner buffet on a Saturday evening and it did not disappoint. Service was good and prompt while the food selection was amazing. From the seafood room to the noodles bar, salad bar, cold cuts, wine bar, pizza selection with the pizza baked right there and then in the built in pizza oven to the live grill station where I can request for grilled whole fish to the international spread of cooked dishes, we were amazed by the variety and quality of food avail. Not to mentioned that their dessert bar comes with own made ice cream too. And this is the only buffet I’ve come across in sg that serves foie gras! Definitely worth the calories and $ spend! Will be back again!
5
I was absolutely amazed by the wide variety of seafood cold dishes that I am spoilt for choices. There’s so many different kinds of fishes, shellfishes, prawns, shrimps and crustaceans, that I almost didn’t know where to starts. Their roast and grill food are also done to the perfect texture while remaining juicy. There also Indian and local delights too! Not forgetting the amazing desserts of sorbet, ice creams, cakes, waffles, crepes and so much more! The ambience is absolutely unique! Don’t miss it
4
We brought some friends from the UK who were in town for dinner. Knowing they had some difficulty with local food we opted for a buffet where they can have choices.And choices they had! Spolit for choice actually. They particularly loved seafood and the quality of the seafood served was superb! You can select and have a whole fish done the way you like - we opted for a grilled fish and it was the tastiest fish I have ever had in a long time. The wide selection of dessert was simply fantastic. You can select local or more western influenced desserts.The staff were all very helpful and friendly. My only complain is that the passage leading to the restrooms was not well lit. This can be improved on
4
It wasn't too crowded and the staff was friendly. We had a great time catching - my friends and I. :
4
Food is really nice but can consider to include more local delights.... the grill station is really good.
5
The buffet is widely-acclaimed - a carefully-curated spread of the best cuisines, its quality is top-notch and well worth the price. We would like to give a special mention to the service staff there - we visited on 03 Nov 2017. The restaurant ran like clockwork, service was excellent and prompt on a busy Friday full-house evening. Both the wait staff and live-station staff were always smiling, from the senior managers to the younger wait staff. They were all so helpful and checked on customers regularly. Plates were cleared in a timely fashion and staff never hurried the patrons. Requests and other orders were acceded to very quickly. They work swiftly but professionally! We wouldn't have minded waiting at all, but wow, we were blown away by the quality of service. The service standard here far surpasses that of other buffets of the same price range, and they are even better than that of many restaurants. We would like to highlight the efforts of live-station staff Watson and Sui Tong (of the charcoal grill station), and wait staff Vincent. Vincent always ensured that our tables were cleared promptly, and on a few occasions when only brief eye contact was made, he appeared very quickly to ask if he could assist in any way. Instead of waiting to be asked over, we could tell that Vincent was actively looking out ways to serve the customers. He was cheerful and beaming despite the bustling crowd, and was always smiling. It was such a busy evening, and one could only imagine how demanding the workload is, yet he never looked harried despite working in a very prompt manner. He also actively asked if he could refill our teapot and spoke to our elderly parents in Mandarin, making them feel comfortable. Watson and Sui Tong manned the charcoal grill, which seemed like the busiest live station of the restaurant. Seeing that we had a huge group (with elderly parents, auntie and a toddler in tow), Watson offered, on a few occasions, for me to return to our table and he would send the dishes over. Of course we tried to return to the station to collect our dishes ourselves at the stipulated time, but we hardly had to, as they were just so observant and quick. Coming from staff who were actually manning live stations and not actually serving the tables, Watson displayed much initiative and went beyond his job scope with his efforts. Sui Tong was extremely smiley and friendly as well, and worked tirelessly with Watson the entire time to serve the patrons at their station, which saw a never-ceasing stream of orders. When our table got up to leave the restaurant, Watson and Vincent came over to bid us goodbye. The above staff mentioned displayed touches that can only come from sincere attitudes and pride in their work. Kudos to the great team, staff members and managers for running an excellent team at Beach Road Kitchen

Would recommend to locals if restaurants open to seniors, 1 for 1 and offers. The new place is easily accessible, good food and only one flaw - waiter failed to give CHOPE discounts. But kind staff refunded.Liked the seafood and cheese selections! Best so far
5
Unbelievably high quality buffet with a wide range of top notch flavors. Show up hungry and with plenty of time to enjoy all the delishness to be had
5
Food at Beach Road Kitchen is situated at the premise of JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach. The warm lights of this restaurants enhance the ambiance of the Kitchen. The restaurant serves sumptuous and quality food. The taste, texture, smell, and presentation of this restaurant were of quality, so refine and well organized. Staff knowledge and attentiveness, the speed of service, were magnificent. I will certainly visit again and recommend my friends
5
The layout of the restaurant is nicely spread out, and the modern interior oozes a trendy yet cozy vibe. On the right side of the main entrance is the stunning walk in cold room that houses an array of carpaccio, fresh lobsters and prawns that were crisp and succulent. The head chef was kind enough to explain the spread, and he proudly told me they smoked their own salmon; none of the store bought nonsense. True enough, the smoked beet salmon was definitely a star dish. He also explained the concept of quality over quantity; they would serve smaller portions but replenish fast enough to ensure the cold food maintain at it's best. And there were freshly shucked French oysters, the chef manning the station was also most obliging to explain the types available. The cheese station located right in front of the cold room had around 6 different types of hard and soft cheeses, and right beside it was a near display of freshly shaved beef and ham pastrami. There was a generous offering of condiments which would make your cheese escapade a deliciously enticing one. The salad bar and self serve noodle bar is located side by side, the fresh and colourful spread was a delightful sight to behold; this salad/noodle bar is surely more than enough to leave vegans or vegetarians feel absolutely satiated! I highly recommend the laksa gravy for the soup base. Moving on to the hot grills, the 2 young chefs manning the grills were knowledgable in sharing the best salt/sauce condiments to go along with the fishes and meats. The chefs informed me they change the fish on the grill menu every couple of days to keep things fresh on the menu. The recommended fish that particular evening was european seabass and promfret. My european seabass came grilled to perfection; a crispy exterior with soft flakey white meat on the inside. The butter and egg yolk sauce was decadent! Go for all the meats, you will regret not tasting the iberico pork, the grilled chicken and the beef cuts. The hainanese chicken was soft, smooth and incredibly tender. What really made my evening was the juicy roast beef that sat proudly on display. Keep a lookout for the baked truffle pizza for they get swiped fast! The dessert bar is every sweet tooth's dream come true. The cakes were divine, there was handmade chocolates and they even make their own sherbets! I could not fault a single thing throughout my dinner; the staff were excellent. Looking forward to my next visit!

The buffet spread was okay. However the food replenishment was slower, and the staff were slow in serving coffee and tea which probably due to manpower shortage.
5
Nice ambiance. Great food. Fantastic efforts by Naffi whose service made the evening memorable for my family
5
From the start, Ali looked after us. The layout is well thought out and the food stations dont seem too crowded. All of the staff we interacted with were enthusiastic and knowledgeable. I'd only gone in for chicken and beef, but the seafood starters were great including king prawns, crab claws and some delicious lobster. Beef, chicken and lamb were excellent. Desserts were plentiful.Thanks again to all that looked after us. I'll be going back soon!
5
Good food with variety, good atmosphere and attentive staff.Fair and highlite bank credit card promotion discount without prompting during payment
5
The food was great, had so many choices and the manager, Ali was definitely very welcoming and assisted with the birthday celebration for my fiance. I will come back to this place anytime! Thank you so much for the team at beach kitchen today
5
There was a large variety of food. Also, the service was very attentive even when the restaurant started to get crowded.
3
disappointed with the spread on a visit on thurs night. many items were not offered as compared to what appeared in reviews. Think the spread was scaled down for weekdays, keeping the price the same and increasing Fri and Sat.
5
Awed from the moment I enter the restaurant. A mixed of old and new. Service was great. Staffs were very attentive and look after comfort of all guests. Enjoyed the grilled sea bass and sashimi and oysters although it was a little salty but they were fresh. It would be perfect if Peranakan dishes can be included as part of the buffet spread. Some fresh berries to go along with the waffle too. I will definitely come back with my family agai
5
Top quality buffet. Great service, especially from manager Ali. Homemade ice cream was super. Make sure your wife has a DBS credit card.
5
Hosted friends visited from Shanghai with the buffet dinner at the Beach Road Kitchen. Definitely enjoyed ourselves in this vibrant and beautifully laid out restaurant!It has really fresh seafood - the oysters are outstanding! And the roast beef is also very good. We made a reservations to avoid disappointment.
5
A friend and I thought we'd check out this new restaurant and we're so glad we did. It was a Monday night and so a little quiet but there were still people in there to give a nice little buzz.The buffet was plentiful (not as large as Sunday brunches but that was a good thing). As you would expect, the chefs at each station were cooking the food from fresh and it was good delicious. The waiting staff, along with the chefs, were also very much on point. They were attentive, informative and friendly.I'm looking forward to my next visit
4
Great cold cuts and shell fish section including lobsters and oysters all readily topped up.Excellent Grilled whole fish on order,Excellent roastsGood deserts, however could do better with the ice cream ( the machine dispensed soft ice cream tasted artificial.Great cheese and hams selection ( HOWEVER, SUGGEST A COVER FOR THEM AS houseflies were seen visiting the meats and cheeses )My reservation through CHOPE was not registered with the front desk but they managed to seat us anyway
5
Though the Sunday Brunch price may seem pricy, but the spread of food is truly of good values - lobsters, crayfish, prawns, oysters, BBQ meat of your selection, and even chilli crabs. And if you add in additional $70 you can have a free-flow of wine and champagne. Dinner pricing and lunch pricing on weekdays are much lower and is reasonable. On top of great tasting food, you also receive a friendly and attentive service
3
Quite a lot of variety but value for food is a bit steep. Nice ambience and dessert station for kids are pretty goo
3
Overall is OK, service is good. ONLY downside is no complimentary parking is provided. Almost all 5 star hotels provide complimentary parking to diners
4
oysters was salty as the nature of the oyster is from France!!overall food was nice n i liked the desserts.
4
The food here are nice and have a wide variety. I am impressed by the staff Mr Mohd Ali as he could still remembers that I have came here to dine before.
Overall food was great just that there were too many diners.
4
Food selection was okay however the freshly made pizza was the highlight of the night. Service was impeccable especially Manager Ali who was on duty. Overall quite a good dining experience.
5
Great food, great atmosphere and excellent service. We only went in for ala carte menu because we always have some doubt with buffet style . But this one really convince us. The quality looks superior. We will definitely go back to try the buffet meal. Amazing variety of food, local and international and my favorite would be the dessert station. Fantastic looking homemade tart and gourmet ice cream. Thank you for great lunch
5
I visited the restaurant together with my girlfriend to celebrate her birthday there and what impressed me the most is the excellent service the staffs offer to their customers. They are all so polite and kind, with great food available as well! Will definitely be back for more. Thanks to the the team and staffs of Beach Road Kitchen
5
Food variety was wide and the quality was really consistant throughout our visit there. Please do make a visit ursel
5
Went there for lunch buffet with family. Very satisfied with the food, place and services especially the mini birthday celebration done by the restaurant staffs. May I propose they put butter cubes nearer to the soup counter instead at the pizza/bread counter and add in sashimi to menu. Anyway thank you for the great lunch
5
We knew about the lunch/dinner buffet in this restaurant and as we always avoid the buffet restaurant ( because of the lack of quality and just the quantity) we always ignore it but this time in Singapore we gave it a shot and I must say it was perfect for us. Because of my son's routine to have early dinner, we dropped by there at 18:00 and be informed that the buffet will be open at 18:00 and the restaurant is almost fully booked. Luckily we got a table and a quite high quality buffet with great seafood range and grill parts as well. At around 19:30 and we were almost done but the restaurant was crowd and there queue for lobsters and sushi. The pizza stand was so helpful and even baked special pepperoni pizza for my son. Totally perfect in good quality of food. Lobster laksa is a must here
5
My friend and I enjoyed a very good dinner. She said it was the best buffet dinner she has had. The service was excellent.
3
We went with high expectations but was awfully disappointed by the food offerings and quality. This was suppose to be summer seafood buffet and the highlights being freshly shucked oysters. No oysters was to be seen. And items like crabs were not topped up. The grilled seafood like squids was of poor quality and tasted like rubber. This will be my first and last time.
5
I came across Beach Road Kitchen while looking for a unique buffet for my sister's birthday. I have to say I was not disappointed at all. I was pleasantly greeted by a rather interesting and open layout of the restaurant. I especially liked the seafood 'room' and the dessert showcases. The seafood was fresh, meat and pizza were very good and some desserts exceeded expectation.The highlight of the dinner would be the amazing staff, notably Mr Ali and Mr Naffis. My family requested for a birthday cake and a song to come along with it from them and they, without hesitation but with great enthusiasm, came to the table with a complementary cake that was very light and fluffy. They volunteered to take pictures for us and were even willing to take one with us! Would definitely recommend Beach Road Kitchen to any buffet-goer as the experience was a wonderful and unique one
5
Great food and great service! The had a good selection of meats and a wide selection of quality desserts. I'll be back :D

Went with my son to celebrate the end of his PSLE. What a disappointing meal it was. The cold food spread, especially, while wide, was sadly lacking in flavor and most disappointingly, had no plain salmon sashimi. Sure, there was salmon tartare but it was rather tasteless.The truffle pizza was lovely as was the roast beef. The rest of it ... yawn. The dessert section was another letdown, especially marred by the presence of a grumpy and bossy staff member manning the station. He was grumbling and apologizing to diners that they were understaffed. That understaffing was apparent as food (both dessert and the main spread) was not replenished fast enough -- twice, I went to get more ice cream and both times, they had run out. Sat lunch buffet was $58++/pax, with every second diner at 50% off. Would I go back there even if it were a 1-for-1 promotion? No, not at all
3
Went for the lunch buffet. The food is spread over a wide area but nothing to shout about as the food spread was not as extensive as the floor spread of the restaurant. The salad area consists of only leafy vegetables with no beans or peas or nuts. There was not a single Japanese food item available. The mains were quite ordinary. The pumpkin soup was too dilute. Even the dessert selection was limited. I tried many hotel buffet and this one pales in comparison. The only positive is the good service of the waiting staff and with special thanks to Raven.
5
Before start the compliment, I'd like to share some disappointment prior reservation first. As me and my boyfriend's point is to have a lobster and lamb. We made a booking for thursday night that I already called from overseas to make sure that those two choices will provide as per price differences. The restaurant reservation said yes so, okay. Then when we arrived no lamb and no lobster. Of course, we were quite disappointed. However, the ambiance is excellent. Widespread of food in a nice allocation and design. I am not a fan of truffles but you all need to try the signature truffles pizza. Thanks to Chef Aljur for provided us a special lamb dish. Really impressed for that. Ryan and Ali for friendly and great service! Already recommended this place to my friend who will travel to SG
3
Food was average, desert was disappointing, spread lacks variety despite having items that you don’t find in other buffets.
3
Had lunch at Beach Road Kitchen on 7 Oct. The quality and range of the food is, at best, average. No sushi or sashimi which is standard for most buffets of this price range. The lay-out of the restaurant is just weird with food stations and dining areas seemingly placed in a haphazard manner. If the restaurant is aiming for "eclectic", it missed the mark. 90 minutes into the start of lunch service and some the desserts started to run-out, and no attempt was made to replenish the desserts. Strangely at this time, they started to replenish the cold starters. Maybe people should eat in reverse order - starting with dessert. Service was good, except for one quirky older guy who kept grumbling to his colleagues and diners alike that he was very, *sigh* very *sign* busy, *sigh*, *sigh*. All in all, we expected a lot better from the outside appearance and the hype
4
Not only was the food display awesome, the food itself was also very good. Great tasting, appealing and of high qualityThe only exception was the mooncake which was a disaster.
5
We came here for the buffet lunch and it was an enjoyable experience. The ambient of the restaurant was very casual and relaxing.There were lots of choices and the ingredients used were of high quality. I enjoyed the king crab legs and the galbi beef ribs very much.My favorite was the noodles/laksa section as you can choose the kind of ingredients that you want to add. The laksa broth was not overly creamy, yet it had a nice texture and very flavorful. I loved the Laksa so much that I had three servings.I have noticed that the replenishment of the Asian cooked food took a while to be replenished. When the fried noodles and fried chicken were finished, there was a long wait before new ones were being served. The service was very good too as the servers here were very accommodating and helpful
2
Felt that the previous reviews were much better. Many recommended items were not available on thurs dinner. We arrived 5 mins before the start of the buffet time. And no one informed us that we could start when they sat other customers. The cold seafood qty was very pathetic, much more ice than seafood. The recommended grill looked sad, cold and very small qty left. Same goes to the 'signature' Truffle pizza. Couldnt taste the truffle at all, felt like eating just the empty crust. The recommended chinese roast only had hainanese chicken and roast duck which was left empty with no one to tend. Empty plates were not cleared promptly. I had to bring it to a hard to spot busy wait staff. Dessert spread was disappointing as well. eclairs and egg tart pastries were soggy, same goes to the hazelnut tart. Was honestly surprised at how soft the 'tart' was. Was it not supposed to be a tart
5
Came here since there was a promo going on for every 2nd diner at 50% off for DBS card holders. I wouldn’t say there there is a big spread but enough variety to feast on. They serve whole fish to you if you have a big group. From roast meat, seafood, foie gras, cheese, noodles, dishes of sauté meat, etc. For salad, you can cut off from the planted pots to consume at it’s freshest. The oyster is disappointing, though fresh, has very thin flesh. There is also a pizza furnace churning our fresh pizza. There were several selections of desert and rows of sweets in containers for sweet lovers to choose from like gummy bears, marshmallows, which can be added to your ice cream or yoghurt. I like the house brand green tea ice cream. The waiters are very smiley and clear your plates quite promptly since the place is not fully filled up. I notice they will go around tables to ask discreetly if there is a occasion to celebrate. They will give a small tart with candle if someone’s was celebrating their birthdays. Overall pleasant ambience and experience.
5
Went there for a lunch buffet, quite an extensive spread even in the seafood department. More than enough crab to go around and wide range of smoked fish to choose from. But it is the service that won our hearts.Special mention for Theodore who was manning the Pizza station (which houses one of their signature truffle pizza, must try!), great initiative by him. As we were seated right in front of his counter, he probably saw us turning our head to check the grill station several times, he approached us to check what we were waiting for and made sure a delicious plate of grilled chicken chop is served to our table within minutes. Thank you for making the lunch experience an exceptional one for this newly wedded couple, especially when we are going to back to work the next day.Keep up the good work!Best,Jaco

My second visit to a restaurant in a Singapore Marriott hotel this month and have been surprised both times by how much better their overall food quality and experience is nowadays. My family enjoyed it and we will be back again
4
Tried this place in Sept and promptly came back in October The food is of high quality so despite not being as wide a spread as some buffet lines, what you get is of high quality. Dinner is highly recommended as the bbq selection is very very good. The chicken, fish and prawns are so fresh and well prepared For dinner, they also serve lobsters and oysters!!Also recommended is the truffle pizzaThe dessert spread can improve though. One other thing to note is that they increased their prices so you now have to pay $88++ for dinners from Friday to Sunday. $10 more than a few weeks ago. At this price range, colony at ritz Carlton also offers a great selection of fresh and well prepared entrees, mains and a to die for dessert spread:-
5
My fiancée booked a dinner buffet here for me to celebrate my birthday tonight. We were promptly seated after having made known our reservations. The seafood, charcuterie and deserts were a combination of quality and quantity. Both departments met our expectations and were a refreshing awakening from the usual fare in most buffet. Mussels, clams had interesting toppings; lobster was fresh and not bland; freshly salt-grilled trout was one of the most moist we've eaten; truffle pizza was the bomb; the dessert spread was decent and original. Pretty worthwhile since they had a promotion for 2nd diner 50%. To wrap up our dining experience, I've to thank Ali and his services crew, in particular Ryan, for making our gastronomic experience warm and prompt. I would recommend this buffet to my contacts and return again. Good job
5
food was superb, fresh and delicious. service staff were very friendly and attentive. will definitely come back again
1
My wife tried for 3 days to reach the dining reservations of JW without any luck, when we finally reached somebody, they advised that we will be called back, again this never happened. After all the effort we managed to make a reservation and on the day of arrival called, only to be told no reservation under our name. At this point and all the signs, we should not have gone. The buffet is very limited and you feel the restaurant made an effort but wanted to keep the cost to a minimum. All dishes are bare standard and lowest quality from sushi (salmon and tuna, the cheapest cuts), to cheese of the poorest sort. Indian selection is missing tandori and was mainly vegetarian. The dessert section had flies and we even discovered mosquitos that resulted in a 40% off. Too little too late and end of the story all guests 2 adults and 2 children went home not just feeling underwhelmed but equally sick and bloated
5
The Food and Services are good.Less oil and less type of food. I like the desert and ice cream.Crab is not so fresh. Chili Crab is my favorite forever.
5
Great service by manager Ali and his team. When I made reservations by phone, Ali suggested to prepare a birthday cake for Jorge. We were well taken care of throughout our lunch- first class service indeed! Food were of excellent quality and variety. Lots of selection in each category.Nice ambience too, modern setting with cozy lightings.Congratulations for a job well done!Will definitely come back agai

Having read very conflicting reviews about this buffet restaurant (caution! caution!), I went with checked expectations. Still, I was let down at the most unexpected areas.Starters:Fail, Fail, Fail! We were all sorely disappointed. There were many marinated items which was a pleasant surprise to me but everything was OVERLY salty! Even the crabs were too salty. So was the salmon. The only okay item that everyone agreed upon was the prawns and that's it. I barely went through my first plate when in fact starters are normally my favourites. It was god awful.Cooked stations:The grilled beef and the pork rib soup were not bad. Satay and prawn dumpling were okay. Their recommended pizza was too salty (again). As for the other items, sadly, many were looking unsightly or not replenished so I was barely able to have anything. I had wanted to try the grilled fish but what greeted me was a pile of messy bones and even messier flakes of fish meat.Desserts: I took 5 different western selections and only 1 turned out bad. This was a surprise as some reviews had singled out the desserts as a disappointment. Maybe it's because I skipped the whole Asian desserts which looked stale. Maybe they got a new pastry chef. However, the comp birthday cake for a friend was just passable.Service: The staff was nice and friendly but our order of tea took forever to come. When the pot was empty it took them forever to remove it. Make that never because we had to ask them to remove it after like 2 hours. Dirty plates were also not removed. No dessert spoons were seen at dessert areas.Environment: Food stations were divided into sections located at different corners of the restaurant. I'm not a fan of this layout as it means a lot of meandering through other tables and having to walk from one end to another end sometimes. There were glass windows throughout but the restaurant was lit in very orangey lights and that's weird because we were basked in night lights and the moment we look outside it was bright and shiny and cheerful. Air-con was a little too chill at our table. Midway through the meal it became warm.Conclusion: Another overpriced outfit. Starter was... what starter? Salt was free here. Or at least for the kitchen staff (a friend said no, it's because the salt was expiring so they need to use it all up). Unlikely to go again.

This restaurant serves as the JW Marriott South Beach's breakfast place. The buffet spread is huge and there's food for all types of diet, culture and taste buds. My favourite would be the fruits area (more than 3 types of fruits), cereal area (with lots of nuts and grains too), yoghurt and yoghurt drinks section (even vitagen is available), drinks counter for fresh fruit juices, the waffles and egg stations too. Service is the only issue - tends to be inconsistent, seems like a training ground for newbies. Each time when I order hot green tea, it always take forever and sometimes it never comes. Stick with the usual coffee and tea and it would be served promptly. I do wish they can improve on this service part of the dining experience
5
The buffet spread and quality of the food is excellent. BBQ station - Foie Gras and Lamb Chop are my favourites items. I do not eat much dessert normally, I took 2 x Tiramisu. The service staffs are efficient and cleared our soiled plates promptly. Manager, Siva was very helpful.

I especially like the seafood section and was very happy to find they have whelk (big sea shell that i love) on my second visit here. The last time i saw some in Singapore was at the time of green house at ritz carlton (years ago!)The cheese selection is quite small but they have very nice types of cheese ( brillat savarin ) this time.The only disappointing dish that i tried was the mushroom soup (worst one ever with only water taste)The service is very professional yet friendly.I will definitely come back

This is a new area and forms part of the complex around the new Marriott Hotel. It has a varied menu ,Malay, seafood , Singaporean , pizza etc. Wine, beer and cocktails, not cheap, paid S$20.00 for a rum and coke, but it was 7 year old Havana Club.!!! Buffet was well spread out with chefs ready to cook any of your selections, meats, seafood , vegetables etc. Fresh shucked oysters, lots of crustaceans on display ,only S$75.00.each.Had a flight to catch so I did not think I could do justice to the buffet, so settled on Jumbo Prawn cocktail. Good food by pricy when you add on service charge and GST

I had my girl's first birthday celebration at Beach Road Kitchen, and it was a fantastic experience! Below summarized the key highlights that delighted myself and the guests :1) Krishna, the restaurant manager assisted with the tables set-up and sent me photos to assure me that everything was in order when I was on my way to the venue. It was done better than I expected as he made the extra effort to arrange more tables as he said would give my guests more space when dining. This goes beyond basic service! 2) When I was setting up the decoration for my girl's birthday, I needed blu-tack and Krishna immediately went to look for it, and fulfilled my request! 3) While dining, I was eating the snow crab legs with my bare hands and just as I was about to get up to the restroom to wash my hands, a server (I didn't take down his name) came up with a bowl of warm water with lemon so that I can wash my hands without heading to the restroom. It was a delightful moment.Overall, service was excellent and my guests were very happy. Food wise, they were equally satisfied and most raved about the array of fresh seafood, tender hainanese chicken rice and the huge selection of dessert.Thank you so much for making my girl's event such a memorable one

It was an awesome experience at Beach Road Kitchen, with a great atmosphere and nice variety of tasty and quality food, which otherwise seems to be missing as everyday there are plenty of eateries are opening in Singapore, but This place no doubt is awesome. The guys are not less then the place and food, Chef Sidhartha ensured with the guests that even if something is not available on menu, ready to make fresh (where possible) and even offers to help the guest understanding and suggesting the best choice. Server Mathan was very helpful too...... Would recommend everyone to visit and taste the best deal meal

I recently stayed at the JW Marriott next to this restaurant in Singapore during a business trip. I tried to go there for lunch one day but the place was on a buyout. So I went for dinner last night. The place closes at 10pm, I arrived at 9:30pm knowing it was closing in 30 minutes. I had the choice of buffet or off the menu. I walked through the buffet and it was decimated, nothing left at 9:30pm and nothing was replenished in the next half an hour. I opted instead anyway for the a la cart menu and had a burger, with fries. The burger came out after 20 minutes or so, not cooked quite to my liking but relatively close enough. The cheese on top was not melted at all either. The burger was on a plain bun, normally ok, but not for $SD 30, Plus there was no-one around to check on me or my meal.I had to flag someone down to order, to get my bill and again to check on my bill for payment, as I could get a discount since I was staying next door at the JW.This restaurant is rated very high in TA for food and service. I am not sure why, I found both the food and service lacking greatness, except for the last (third) server who took provided me a discount on my room charge

Great food, good spread especially the meats, cold spread and deserts. Great service by Julia & Gyu and attentive section manager Ali! Will be coming again.

Went to BRK for birthday dinner, was not disappointed. Great variety of local cuisines, grilled meats, and seafood selection. Requested for a birthday cake surprise in my Chope reservation and the restaurant delivered it beautifully. Will visit again definitely
5
So far this resturant has the awesome service i came across. Not sure if it is because we are early. The staff at the cold section introduce all the food to us at the cold section. Another is the grill section. We ordered 2 fishes but somehow we can only get 1. The staff actually went to search for us (we are not at our table) to apologise and replace with another fish (from the kitchen) which is not at the counter. We were impressed by their service
5
Balkrishna Baraskar had given excellent service to me and my friends he had made us happy by his awesome service he is very quick attentive and very hardworking and the staff is very good and friendly food is good the ambiance is nice we will love to visit again soon Thanks for take good care of usGood luck for your future Balkrishna hope to see you soon
5
Beautiful and comfortable ambience. This is not my first time here, so was disappointed when the food was slightly different two weeks back. Didn't offer lobster, and the truffle pizza lacked the truffle flavour. Nonetheless, the service staff was friendly and attentive, making it an enjoyable experience

I had a very great experience at South Beach Kitchen. The staff are very friendly and smile alot. Its my brithday celebration with my family, they arranged for a small Birthday cake and even ask my husband when is a good time to serve it. I want to compliment on a their staff. They service us in great pleasure . Especially XiaoJuan, Rawen and Gyu who are always on the look out to clear our plates and top up our wines. I give their service a thumb up . Atomsphere is good with great smoothing music. I love their neatly arranged food especially the cold appertizer section and dessert selection. Everything is place in a neat manner and with much pride. Can see they put in alot of efforts. My son is delighted by the jars of sweet available. Its really a joy for him . We truly enjoy the dinning experience here and will recommend it to others. Thank you for making my Birthday a memorable one.

Excellent spread with great service, especially by Bayakrishna. He has been very helpful with our dining experience, taking extra care to cater to our needs. Very good overall experience

Free flow wines, excellent service, nice ambience, fresh oysters. Hot meal selection can be better. Once again, commendable service

Good food and drinks selection (with quality tea, cappuccino, ice tea)... and seating was spacious to

We were very happy with the selection of food especially the seafood section. Staff were friendly especially Thiva, Greg & one of the waiter who attended our table outside.Thank you for the wonderful dinner experience which we had on the 09th September 2017. We will definitely patronize the restaurant again in our future visit to Singapore.
5
Our office staff had a wonderful time at the lunch buffet and special thanks to Assistant Manager Ali for his sterling service and assistance. Keep it up
5
Excellent Food - Specially the seafood section was amazing ! The staff is warm and able to provide personalized service durinng our Dining experience .We would strongly recomend the Restaurant Manager - thiva sridaran . He went out of his way to make sure our visit was memorable and he created a long lasting impression.Wising Beach Road Kitchen greater succes
5
This was the 1st time the family visited South Beach and the Beach Road Kitchen. We had read some good reviews and had run out of buffet places to celebrate our birthdays! Although the price was fairly high, the place was packed which tells you the quality of food they were serving! The family was slightly disappointed that there was no lobster on offer but the rest of the seafood was very high quality! The barbecue section where the 2 chefs grilled Sea Bass, Trout, chicken, marinated ribs etc is a must try! The sea salt marinated Sea Bass was excellent!We were fairly stuffed trying the various foods so the dessert section was only average (IMHO) as I was quite full by then and was not keen on trying the sweets. However, what little space my tummy had left, the steamed tapioca was delightful!I must commend Ali - one of the more senior members of staff for making the effort as he was attentive to our needs!I will definitely be back on the proviso that there is still a credit card promotion (DBS / POSB)

Nice spread for the lunch buffet. Lots of local cuisine such as chicken rice, laksa and paranakan food

My partner and I went to The Beach Road Kitchen at JW Marriott on the 1st of September to celebrate our 2 year anniversary. Initially I was a tad apprehensive towards the restaurant despite reading the wonderful reviews by food bloggers. I thought, well, every eatery will treat food bloggers as their majesty. We were greeted by the in house manager, Wing, of The Beach Road Kitchen upon entering the premise. We asked for a larger space when we were showed a small table. Ms Wing was willing to accommodate our request readily. We went around to check out what were available. To be honest, the appearance of the food didn’t do justice to the taste of them. =)I was an avid fan for seafood however, The Beach Road Kitchen was the only restaurant I was willing to try other food happily. My partner, though not as fussy person like me, he’s quite particular with the quality of food. He was impressed with every dish provided by The Beach Road Kitchen. Yes, he tried a little of every dish. He was very pleased that I chose The Beach Road Kitchen to celebrate our 2 year anniversary. Most buffet places serve food which taste like buffet, however, The Beach Road Kitchen was different. Every dish tasted as if the chef specially cooked just for you. Their pastries were must try! Chiffon cake was so good they beat Benganwan Solo, hands down! When I realised they ran out of mango ice cream (when my partner loves mango), I asked if they had extra cups of ice cream. Ms Wing got the pastry chef to make a brand new one for us as that day was a special occasion for us. As the food and service blown us away, my partner was toying with the idea of having our holy matrimony there. Even many days after we left there, my partner kept saying the food from The Beach Road Kitchen spoiled us and no other food could impressed him =) We also noticed the homeliness the premise was set up to be. Not old school but a homely feeling as if you had stepped into a close friend’s house for dinner. The widespread of variety of yummy food made the patrons felt spoilt for choice.  Awesomeness, was nothing but an understatement. Thank you Ms Wing, the other male manager in training who served us our anniversary cake (my apology for not remembering your name) and The Beach Road Kitchen for the wonderful meal and experiences. I will be bringing my family to celebrate my parents’ birthdays and anniversary in October

All the cooked foods tasted excellent, not like others buffet restaurant the cooked foods tasteless, the cold seafoods section was a bit disappointed, didn't get to eat the whole lobster... They served excellent desserts...paid extra for wines free flow and the wines are good too..What i can said is overall are very good, excellent service from the server Miss Wei Lai...2 x thumbs up for her smiling face all the times...we will be back and intro to all my friends
5
This is by far the best buffet restaurant in Singapore with even better service staff who made my experience so memorable. Kudos to Chef Sid, Chef Edwin, Chef Joy and Chef Safwan

Was initially disappointed with staff manning reservations. They could not tell me the spread for the buffet nor the promotions correctly. Ambience at BRK was nice. We were seated on the far end of the restaurant. It was a narrow space to walk to get to the main action where the food was. The selection of fish for BBQ was certainly the star of the night. We had 3 different types of fishes - seabass, trout and pomfret. All were lightly marinated with sea salt and grilled to perfection. Kudos to the grill staff. It was a pity the fishes ran out and were not replaced. The LA galbi was also very well marinated and well grilled. The truffle pizza could do with more truffle as the taste was a tad mild. The noodle station was fun as there was a wide selection of ingredients you could choose to add to create your own bowl. Laksa had just the right amount of spice and full of aroma and flavour. Dessert section was wide and interesting. The chocolate coated almonds were a hit. The ice cream however were not replaced, which was a pity as we could not have a second serving of the green tea, which was rich and creamy. The tea served in a pot was nicely kept warm in its insulated pot as the aircon was really cold. The wait staff, however, could do with more tips on how best to serve the diners. We had asked for warm water but cold water was served instead. Sometimes, the plates were cleared too fast, without checking if we were finished with it. There were however some staff that made the experience at BRK worth mentioning. Manager Ali and Awal were both attentive and tried their best to attend to diners request. Overall it was a good experience especially with the current credit card promotion.

Had an amazing dinner buffet with my best friends and we were highly impressed with the quality of good served. From the oysters and seafood in the unique Cold Room, laksa that was super delicious, to-die-for truffle pizza (that we had multiple helpings of), pan-fried foie gras, meats (and meats and meats), grilled whole fish (I highly recommend the seabass) paired with a salt selection, and the dessert selection that made me regret eating so much before... The team was great too! Special compliments to Chef Safwan, Chef Joy, Chef Edwin and Thiva! I'm looking forward to my next meal here! ;)

This place gives a good first impression – with its rather large floor area (with some interesting use of space, like a crammed little cranny for the cold cuts) and wide range of food. But after my friends and I tucked into the buffet meal, we soon discovered that there were hits and misses. Some dishes were good – such as the signature laksa, truffle pizza, lamb chops, lasagne, soft serve and tiramisu. But other dishes were either lacklustre or quite bad. The service, too, was not very consistent – often our used plates were not cleared from our table even after we had returned from taking another helping. There are better buffets around town
5
Was an excellent lunch buffet. The spread was more than sufficient but most importantly, it was the quality of food that made this buffet one of the best ones around. The truffle pizza was one of my favourite dishes as was the meat at the live station. Was pleased with the free flow bourbon iced lemon tea. Enjoyed also the mooncake they had at dessert as well as the delicious soft serve dark chocolate ice cream between 2 cookie pieces! Will definitely be back to try the dinner buffet soon.
5
The Seafood Room is refreshingly different to most of the Singapore hotel buffets.The seafood dishes are more European. We loved it. Other bonuses are the Pizza Oven, Carvery section, Salad wall, Cheese Corner, Dessert area and Asian section. Great Value for lunch. They also have a free flow wine option for about $30. Great dea
4
Cosy and nice place - feel like at home. Very nicely decorated. We had Antipasti Lunch. All food were cold, if they include pasta and pizza will be good!
4
It was a dinner get together for a party of eight over good, quality food. We found the chefs and service staff especially polite, attentive and engaging. We'd like to thank Nabbis (hope I got his name right) and his colleagues who attended to our table for their prompt and good-humoured service. Other than the fact that it felt a little warm and stuffy at our table (it could well be an air-conditioner vent issue), we thoroughly enjoyed our dinner and would definitely consider a return visit soon.

Popped by on a Saturday evening without prior reservations and was lucky to get a seat, so we decided to try out the dinner buffet (S$78++ as of 6 Sep 2017). Spread was good with a mix of continental dishes, fresh pizzas, asian flavours, live stations, and desserts. I skipped the asian dishes so I could have more of the international fare, and wasn't disappointed at all. Here are my personal favourites:- Impressive variety of antipasti (by local buffet standards), complete with assorted cured meats, cornichons, anchovies, artichoke hearts, pickled herring (I adore antipasti but they aren't always available at local F&B outlets).- Live station for freshly grills meats, fish, and pan-fried foie gras. I'm not a big fish person but I went back for seconds because the grilled whole fish was fresh and delicious, even on its own. The pan-fried foie gras served on slightly-buttered toast is a big hit and you may have to wait for a bit, but it'll be worth the short wait. - Eat cold cooked seafood freshly-shucked oysters till you go OY! There were a few types of oysters available on the evening I visited so you can taste the flavours of different variants then go back for more of your favourite. The chap shucking the oysters was really friendly too, and was helpful in giving suggestions when he saw that I couldn't decide.The restaurant offers a good selection of desserts, fresh fruits, juices and candy as well, so those with a sweet tooth would enjoy this. I wish I had more stomach space after the visit, as I'm a small eater and didn't get to try all the dishes available. It's pricey, but worth it, so maybe save the visit for a special occasion? =
5
Excellent service and wide variety of food. The seafood are in a fridge environment which is very unique and good. Waffle is crispy and very fragrance
5
The food is excellent and great value for the price. Unfortunately I was informed that my booking was overbooked and I had to be seated on the outside of the restaurant, which was, in Singapore's warm weather, not quite ideal and was unexpected. However, the service staff did handle themselves well and we were moved into the air-conditioned comfort of the restaurant, albeit an hour and a half later. Kudos to Jason and Viwan for the great service and cheerful demeanour throughout the night

Hi, Heard from a friend that the seafood spread was good. And i went today craving for some good oysters with my partner, Indeed i manage to get some oysters at 7plus when i reach .. when i wanted to get the 2nd time, i couldn't manage to get any after walk to the counter for 3 times and in the end i gave up. I understand that they are a few big groups that's why the food is running out so fast but i think it would be fine if they can replenish the oyster faster so that we the smaller group benefits as well .. This is just a little feed back. Thank you
5
the food is good and service is excellent and i want to thank catherine for going extra mile to give me birthday last minute request for my son and lastly very surprise for the toy chef marrio.
5
Celebrated my husband's birthday on the 22nd of August 2017 there. Had requested a table for 4 pax near the food as we had an elderly guest with us....the manager Mr Ali was every so obliging and gave us what we thought was the best VIP table in the house!Great start to what proved to be a wonderful dinner. My son had been looking forward to the Tomahawk and was not disappointed at all. Chef Fang Chea gave him the biggest and the best available. Chef Watson followed up with a wonderfully grilled sole just as we requested- crispy on the outside and succulent inside! He also made me a serving of very delicious foie gras on toast and the best waffles a la minute after.The seafood was all very fresh and not at all like other buffets in town...believe you me we have tried everywhere. Chef Seet from the kitchen and ALL the wait staff were very attentive and sang HAPPY BIRTHDAY to my husband in perfect harmony. Even took photos for us.First time ever for serial buffet diners with not a single complaint. New favourite restaurant!! Be back soon!! For sure!!
5
Excellent buffet spread, quality food and while the place is not big, the place give us the warmth and lots of options for buffets
5
Glad we chose to celebrate my friend's birthday here. Relaxing environment good food and excellent dessert.Must try:- Tiramisu- Gluten free chocolate cookie- Local delights- CheesesThank you Ali, Jia Xuan and team for making this birthday lunch memorable.Will return for dinner

The quality of the food is good, but the varieties are limited.
The seafood in the cold section is fresh and up to standard.
5
After our ROM, me, my husband and both our families had a lunch celebration at Beach Road kitchen. We chose this place because we thought the ambience and set up was perfect and the spread looked great, suitable for people of all ages (especially when we had 6 kids and 2 elderly). We got to say, it was one of the best buffet places we have been to from food selection and taste, to the design of the restaurant (we liked that we could roam the entire restaurant for different variety of food), to staff attentiveness. As I was in a LONG dress, not the most suitable for go from places to places for food. There was a particular staff that went the extra mile to always be on a look out if I was going to leave my seat to somewhere else. If I was, he would rush to me to help me with my dress (not even my husband did that, he was enjoying the food too much to notice :D). If only I knew the name of this server as I really appreciated his kind gesture and professionalism. Special thanks to Krishna, for helping us with the reservation months ahead, allowing us to take a look at the area beforehand, planning the tables such that we had an almost exclusive corner for ourselves, smooth billing and service that way exceeded our expectations. My grandmother loved this place so much, we has been hinting for me to bring her back to eat the delicious steamed fish! Which I will, in October for her birthday. Thanks Beach Road kitchen for being part of our wonderful memories during our ROM day

The food selection is not really a lot but the quality of food is superb! The service is also very prompt, plates are cleared very fast and attentive to requests.
5
Went on a Monday evening and avoided the normal buffet crowd. Dining experience was heightened simply because there was less noise and pressure to get ur food. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful in introducing the food, and service at the table was great too - lots of attention and smiles
5
Went here for lunch buffet with Husband. The service over here is very good! The best lunch buffet I ever had! All the food over here are very presentable. We were very happy over here. Balkrishna is one who serve us. He is very attentive and thoughtful.
5
The 6 of us had a gathering at the restaurant to celebrate a friend's birthday. We liked the ambience of the place. It gave a modern, stylish and cosy feel. We were impressed with the variety and quality of food. I actually made a request to celebrate the friend's birthday through Chope reservation. Thinking that the restaurant might not have received the memo or had forgotten about it, I wanted to settle the bill. The waitress attended to me, Raven, promptly asked if I had made a birthday request. We were behind some food section and she could point out the colour of the tee of the birthday boy when I told her which of us was that person. I was impressed with her attentiveness and prompt service. A complimentary birthday cake was served immediately and a birthday song addressing to the name of the birthday boy was sang. On the whole, we had a great time at the restaurant. Thank you South Beach Restaurant

On 29th Aug, my girlfriends and I went to the JW Marriot at South Beach and we experienced one of the worse ever experiences. The following is a summary of the experience:- 1. Our Champagne glasses (2 of the 3) were dirty.2. When I requested for some water, it never came for almost 30 mins, and I had to drink from my friendâ€™s glass. It never came. And when I enquired with the on duty Manager, Mr Thivagaran Sridaran, he immediately denied responsibility by blaming the servers, claiming he had already notified them and it was their responsibility, not his. These servers are just trainees, and isn't it the duty managers' responsibility to guide and lead them? 3. The candy jars were wrongly labelled. It stated M&Ms but inside were some other candies. Definitely not M&Ms.4. Despite raising all of the above issues with the duty manager, Mr Sridaran never took action. He just shrugged all responsibilities and just sat at one of the tables and continued to work on his laptop. He even blamed the Chef, for the issues and that they were not his responsibility as he was just part of the management tea
5
Had a dinner with my family. I would like to give the following feedback.The service crew are excellent and the food are fresh and of high quality and the ambience is cozy. A special mention to assistant restaurant manager Mr Ali and Ms Wing for their excellent welcome and exceptional service.
4
selection was not extensive but full of quality food which is what we all need, afterall how much can one eat. gave a 4 rating instead of 5 was that we given an outdoor seating when the restaurant is not full at 6pm and we made the reservation weeks in advance. was a bit disappointed by the arrangement though they move did move us in when we requested for indoor after telling them i dont want to wait for available table when their diners arrived. the noodle section needs improvement the prawn soup was subpar.other than that service was excellent, the team were attentive and observant and is proactive in noticing we need a finger bowl wash. well done
5
love the whole concept of their live stations. especially loved their grilled fish where you have a few choices to picked from. managed to capture only one picture as i was too hungry and forgot to even hold my phone haha. special thanks to chef watson and chef felix for the korean beef and fish served to the table! and to the rest of the service team as well! will definitely come back with an empty stomach
4
The appetizers/ cold sections were the key difference when compared to other buffet offerings. A wide selection of seafood: crabs, prawns, clams, octopus, etc. Service was more to be desired though and expected of a 5 star establishment.
5
One of the best quality buffet spread available. Great ambience and great service. Ali was one of the in charge during my latest patronage and he made sure each of my requests were fulfilled. Will definitely see myself for the fifth patronage soon
5
Great food and nice ambience. However, the king crabs ran out quite early and there was no further top up
5
Enjoyed the excellent buffet spread, especially the seafood. Leave room for the wide selection of desserts
5
Food and service are top notch. Especially the cold room and the grill stations. Pizzas and the local selection are good too
4
Visited this place for my 21st. The food are great and ambience too. With choices such as foie gras, lobsters, oysters and more, it is definitely worth every penny.A slight disappointment of mine is that drinks are not included in the $78++, but they do serve complimentary water.I think the highlight of this place would be their service! Knowing that its my 21st Chef Watson took the extra mile and make a birthday cake personally. I really appreciate it.So shoutout to Chef Watson and Manager Ali for going out of their way to make this cake for my 21st. Really appreciate the effort
2
It was supposed to be a seafood themed buffet yet the variety of seafood was not comparable to other hotels
4
Had wonderful time having food in beach road kitchen.... received lovely service from the staff... specially balakrishna... he was very helpful n concern about the guest services. Thank u so much.. n keep doing well.
5
The staff were attentive and efficient. Food was fresh. We particularly loved the barbecued seabream fish. Good atmosphere for friends to meet up. The barbecue food and sashimi come up tops. The lobsters and crabs could have been better
4
The service is good. The waiters will try to fulfil our needs. But a little short handed. We have to repeat our requests 2-3x.The food are delicious and hot
5
I would like to thank Mr. Ali for his excellent service by getting me a indoor seat for my son and me. As it was a very hot and humid day and I had training the whole afternoon under the hot sun. I was quite angry when I was shown the outdoor seat which I wasn't informed when I made the reservation. However, Mr. Ali was quick to get me a cold drink while he check if it is possible to get an indoor seat. He came back within 5 mins and had our seat changed.The food and service was excellent as the staff were attentive and the grill counter staff were very helpful in recommending the available choices. The food were refill very fast and the staff even offer to bring the food to my table when they refill it.I would definitely return with the wonderful staff and food from the Kitchen
4
The lunch we had offered a wide selection of food, however we wanted to have oysters and lobsters and we realised that, that's only for the dinner menu.
5
Fantastic food. Loved the ambiance and hotel staff. Few dishes exclusively available at Dakshin. Strongly recommend this restaurant
5
I would like to thank the staff of Beach Road Kitchen for giving us such a memorable night. We were celebrating our birthdays and they were extremely careful about the surprise which I've prepared. We love the grilled fish that was air flown from France. It was heavenly. Other unforgettable dishes include the scallops ceviche, tea jelly, Laksa. Everything else were well prepared too.The service given to us tonight was so good that one would have easily mistaken it as a high class restaurant and not just another hotel buffet. We'd definitely visit this place again 
3
Maybe it was all the great reviews posted that had heightened my expectations. We were impressed but that feeling was fleeting. The interior was not bad and the food stations were all spaced out.Grilled fish did not impress Salmon sashimi was rubbery and not sliced properly. Beef was not too bad. Truffle pizza was nice but not as nice as the one from ALT Pizza.Laksa was so so. Desserts were not bad. Brie cheese was good but how could that go wrong. As for the service, the service rendered by the staffs altogether were better than the manager in a suit. The Indian manager that day look and sounded condescending. Well, maybe he had a bad day. The attitude of the female hostess/ waitress was just about the same as the manager. I had requested for a corner seat as I hate being placed in the middle of groups. I was given a corner; right next to the bin. No problem since I got a change of table. Also mentioned briefly on 2 occasions that we were celebrating a birthday but no effort was put into it even though in the email from them to me, they'd mentioned that a surprise would be given.So to sum it up:Food was really just average. Service was acceptable BUT praises for the ground staffs only. Manager needs to reflect on his service attitude or maybe I am too sensitive. Overall, worth a try but I wouldn't go back anytime soon.

The restaurant's selection is wonderful, there's a lot of varieties of seafood to choose from. Unlike some other buffets, the seafood is replenished quickly.The service is excellent. The staff are patient, polite and well-spoken.The highlight of my visit were the tuna steaks in the grill section, the black pepper crab dish and the whole dessert selection. I'll definitely come back.If I have any negatives it's that for some dishes, the light isn't enough to keep the food hot. I didn't enjoy the lasagne very much because it was barely warm

Walked into restaurant feeling welcomed and leaving the restaurant feeling satisfied.Friendly service staff greeting constantly, checking if everything is okay, if they could render any assistance, answering our queries with patience, clearing plates regularly and refilling our drinks regularly. They make me feel like home!Food spread was reasonable, with good number of seafood, hot dishes and desserts. The staff replenish the food rather promptly too!Was there with my partner and he kept emphasizing on how good the service are, that he left the restaurant with a big smile and a big tummy. Definitely would visit again

Pricey, but the Beach Road Kitchen dinner buffet offers a huge variety of choices, particularly in its seafood area. Come hungry. Special hat tip to Ali, their man at the front, who was most accommodating and made our first dining experience there very enjoyable
5
Wow, very crowded night but yet food was still the best. I think they had increased more type of fish compared last visit. There are more local food as well. Special thanks to Chef Jason for showing us again the restaurant and also Chef watson who served us the fish although was very busy night.
5
This is a place with a great ambient and attentive service staffs. It's serves a good variety of fresh seafood

Tip-top service. Very friendly staff. Loved the starters or cold room. Good selections of hot and cold dishes.Dessert could be improved though

Came here for a birthday celebration. The restaurant was rather small but the decorations and ambience was warm and welcoming with Peranakan and childhood memories sprinkled all over. The spread of the buffet was not as wide as it can be but it certainly made up for the seafood that was on offer. Canadian lobster, oysters, snow crabs, clams and prawns were all provided and they were absolutely fresh. On top of the raw seafood, there was an open grill where you could order sea bass, golden pomfret and other seafood grilled fresh as you order it. We had the grill golden pomfret and sea bass and again they were fresh. There were a few Indian cuisines and local cuisines as well but they were not as enticing as the above. The desert however was also spot on. The soft serve ice cream really was to die for. Both the vanilla and chocolate variety had rich ingredients and felt expensive to the taste. The vanilla ice cream was milky and the chocolate one had just the right amount of bitter in them. The berry tiramisu was really good as well as it had a hint of rum in it. (this was a very sinful dinner for us as we had seconds and thirds!)Service wise the wait staff were friendly and engaging however due to the number of tables that were full that day, they were rather busy. There was free flow ice lemon tea which had to be ordered from the wait staff and they took quite some time to arrive. But otherwise the service was rather goodOverall, for the price we paid, it was absolutely value for money! Do take advantage of DBS cardholder's 50% off for every second paying diner too

Possibly the best buffet lunch I've ever had. Excellent selection of local and international cuisine. Every dish I tried was delicious. Staff were very friendly and helpful and took good care of us, going out of there way to make sure our needs were met. Even the head chef Jason Chiu was on hand to serve Sashimi and was particularly friendly.It's a fixed price buffet and is pricey enough but given the quality of the food we didn't feel overcharged. Kids under 6 eat for free. Note that if you want alcohol with your meal it's extra. We spent 3 hours there and even overran the finishing time, but there was no attempt from the staff to rush us out the door.There was a play area corner especially for young kids with a TV and toys which kept ours entertained. There is a pizza counter next to the play area where the kids can make their own pizza with the help of a member of staff

I went dinner on a Sunday night, the restaurant was quite full. The atmosphere of the restaurant was not bad. The cold seafood, oyster and cured fish was very nice, tasty and fresh. The cheese and carne meat was also very nice.The hot food and carving is really not nice at all and the food was not even warm. The grill item was always empty...the presentation of the food was all dry up and was even refresh..The only good item is freshly grill whole fish and the pan fried goose liver. The variety of the dessert was not good too. The Chef need to have a better product knowledge and also they should know what are serving. They can tell guest "meringue is hard cream", "lychee ice cream as coconut ice cream"....the Chef from the noodle station try to help but end up he himself also don't know..I think all the station Chef should be knowledgeable of the buffet item and able to explain to guest need..this is very important
4
Great ambience with great quality food. All the staff were very friendly and courteous! Wide selection of food and freshly cooked! Love it!
3
Food was excellent; service was good; but the restaurant inside was hot and stuffy. The door leading to outdoor seating was open hence air con was not strong
4
Service staff are excellent. Buffet food spread were good. Quality of the food were great too. Ambient of the restaurant is good but sitting arrangement can be improved to give more space and privacy. A strong recommendation to a anyone who are looking for quality buffet food
3
Reached about 7pm. We got a round of grilled big head prawns and cray fish. About 10 and 6 respectively for 4 people. The second time we went, the chef told us they don't have the big head prawns and the cray fish already. Left small live prawns and asked if we want. At that time, the restaurant was not full. About 40-50% occupancy. I suggest to have enough food for customers and moreover we went there for the seafood and was quite disappointing although the restaurant manager service was quite good.
4
Food quality was fantastic, laksa was very tasty! Cold selection were very impressive with fresh lobster. Deserts were a little disappointing! Overall nice place for Sunday Brunch
3
I went to check out to lunch buffet based on the favourable reviews here. I must say that the quality of the food wasn't up to the standards I would expect. I have been to JWs around the world and the although it's always expensive, the food quality matches up to the price you pay. This was different. Sure, if you want your fix of seafood and cold cuts, it's great. But the rest of the stuff looked fancy but does not taste as good as it looks.

I have received an unexpected service. Bill was calculated in error, promo was 2nd diner at 50% off, but the staff mistook it as 1 for 1. As the consumer, I doubled check on the bill by asking it TWICE! Not once but twice. And staff told me is correct. As a prestige restaurent, I take it that is all well but manager came to me again said that bill is calculated in error. He has to void my previous bill and bill me a new one. And they took more than 10 mins just to bill me a new bill. I am very sure that there were previous customers who had left were billed wrongly, so are they going to chase after them for the wrong bill?One of the outrageous customer service I ever had, and wouldn't recommend anyone to there.
5
We went to there without a booking, but since we arrived around 8:30pm, many available tables r there. Presentation was very sophisticating and has many varieties of food. We could try out all food. Whole fish was grilled and it's a must item!! Cheese and cold meat were very enjoyable kinds.Shellfish r amazing!! Don't forget to keep space for desserts. Usually, I don't enjoy the sweet comer, but I regretted that I hadn't done so. Very creative and tasty desserts wait for ur coming till the end. Service staff and kitchen staff were kind with their smiles, but only one thing that we got disappointed was no one would inform us that food would be closed around 9:45pm. As we saw their starting to clear the dishes by wrapping 5mins before 10:00pm, we realized that the restaurant would be closing.Other things were great!
5
This all day dining restaurant at JW Marriott Singapore South beach has a mouth watering spread at breakfast....the best breakfast spread I have ever eaten
5
Went there for dinner. Buffet is very good, with good variety of food. Very good service. Good environment. Spacious and warm. I want to go again, I will go again
3
To be honest, I'm not crazy about seafood and I found the majority of the buffet to be seafood. So I don't feel I got my money's worth. But if you like seafood and/or want to try different things this may be the place for you.
5
Although this restaurant also offers a la carte menu, it excels in the Buffet selection with an ample variety of cold and hot items, with separate stations and a pizza oven. Recommende

Beach Road Kitchen is the restaurant provided by JW Marriott South Beach in Singapore, with 1 minute walking distance from Hotel Lobby. Beach Road Kitchen provided all kinds of variety cuisines for travelers like Italian, Japanese, South East Asia, Singapore styles, etc. You can fully satisfy and find your own favorites easily in one single spot. Two thumbs up
5
Second visit to this place with friends. Excellent food, foie grad, lobsters, oysters, mutton, beef, ... just to mention some. Nice ambience and setting. Wide variety of food selections. Good effort from Chef Stefano, Chef Jason and Chef Charles. An enjoyable and "fulfilling" evening well spent
5
First, thanks, Chef Stefano and Chef Jason for the wonderful dinner. My friends and I enjoy the night. Love the pizza, fantastic thin crash, strong flavor, highly recommended.Got to mention the laksa, rare to seen 1 in such a high-end buffer, but yes there is laksa, surprisedly nice, just try it. The Nice food you should try like Korean beef, Foie gras, special ham and cheese and dessert etc. Overall it worth your every cent to dine here. I will be BACK
5
my second visit to this resturant,great food and wide variety of selection . the tomahawk beef and truffle pizza is a must eat when there.also not to be miss is the grill vegtable and lamb.not grill before but only when u order it.the chargrill fish is cook to perfection.chef stefano and chef jason are the 2 chef making this dining experience grea
5
we had just dine in beach road kitchen with my wife, the food is great especially the wide variety of seafood..and service is excellent and thanks to catherine for taking care of us.
5
My wife and I stayed here while I had some business in Singapore, and had breakfast every day and a lunch buffet here one time. All is good here! Service is exemplary and the food is excellent across the board...a winning combination for sure! Desserts are all awesome
5
Very good and a lot of variety! Quite expensive but it's worth it! The staff is approachable and very nice! Good food and have a Great Team! Thank you so much for the hospitality! I'm sure i will come back and visit again! Once again thank you
5
An incredible range of delicious well presented dishes. From the freshest seafood and salads to sizzling Singapore chilli crab everything was super. We forgot to take the sevice and GST into account so the final total was higher than expected. But we have an amazing memory of a super brunc
5
The food and atmosphere were excellent. Big thanks to the staff for catering to our requests. My gf and I enjoyed ourselves thoroughly
5
Just had a group dinner there. Excellent food, great service and awesome atmosphere. Highly recommended. Definitely coming back with the family
4
Celebrated a friend's birthday in this lovely restaurant. Service is outstanding and the buffet spread is superior, especially the seafood section. Excellent selection of fresh prawns and fish are grilled to perfection for us. A birthday cake surprise made the evening perfect.
4
Popular and busy, this restaurant goes out of its way to make you welcome.A preliminary guide to all the food stations by one of the chefs, attentive service throughout our meal, and staff who offer assistance if ever you appear undecided all went toward making this an extremely pleasant experience.Food wise you are spoiled for choice, and would be silly not to choose the full buffet option.The food itself is nice, not breath taking, but of good quality, and while buffets often seem to sacrifice quality for quantity, beach road kitchen does not fall into this trap
5
Everything was excellent except for the Hainanese Chicken Rice. We only noticed that there was this "stall" hidden in 1 corner of the live kichen. We were too full then to try. Cold Dish section - good spread and fresh. Indian corner - good. BBQ steak and pizza - excellent. Laksa and soup - disappointing, especially the fish maw soup and old cucumber. They were luke warm, horrible. Local Dishes - impressed with the steamed chicken with black fungus. BBQ Seafood - excellent serving of fresh seafood grill to perfection and top off with a sprinkle of sea salt. Complete the dinner with the good spread of dessert, fruits and ice-cream. Well worth the cost of $75 per pax
5
Went with a couple of friends on a Saturday evening and I have to say the buffet spread was fantastic . It's wasn't too busy and the crowd was decent. The lobster is the highlight in my opinio
4
Went there as a belated birthday celebration for my friend. Overall experience is excellent. The food variety and quality is excellent. The environment is very good and unique. The service is very good and fast. The only problem will be the price. Buffet at the price point and quality there is still quite a few and most have promotion with major credit card. Hope the promotion will be better or at least be there to stay. If not I will say for 1st time experience. It's worth it. But I likely won't go again. I do highly recommend a 1st try. Their foie gras is really good. So it there seafood section.

Before I wrote this review, I read a few of the bad ones but I find that my dining experience at this place was just the contrary. This was my first time at Beach Road Kitchen and I think I would not have done justice to this place if I did not write this.When I came in with a reservation but was given a table near to the entrance, I requested for a change of table but was told that the place was fully booked so that was not possible. But instead of a "take it or leave it" attitude as we have all encountered from service staff in Singapore, this front desk service staff actually leave us with a assurance that once a table was available, she could change it for us. Though she did not come back with one later on, I thought that was a nice gesture and friendly enough to start with. 8/10. The atmosphere was pleasant but because the food was spread around different corner of the restaurant, there was much movement from the diners and I thot was a little unpleasant if your seat was situated in the middle of everything. Small problem but 7/10. I went for the grilled fish and asked for a sea bass. When I went back 10 mins later to get my fish, it was not ready but I suspected it was hijacked by another diner. The chef told me to come back 5 mins later instead. When I did, my fish was still not ready and told me to wait for another 5 mins. This time I stood there to wait just to make sure they remember me. One female service staff noticed my present and she was so kind to tell she could bring the fish to my table instead. She followed me to my table to see where I sit and later she brought the grilled fish to me and commented "The fish was grilled especially for you". Small gesture but good attitude. Good staff. 10/10. Tried the laksa. Friendly chef and fast service. The moment you stood with your bowl in front of him, he would ask for your request with a smile on his face. 10/10. I did not noticed the names of the many good service staff that I have encounter but Mr Ali was another exception. He would always clear our used plates with a pleasantry. I asked him for direction to the washroom which he gave clearly. When he saw me again moment later, he thought I have not found the place and volunteered to take me there too. Wow. Little things like that make your day. 10/10. I asked for extra fork and knife and they delivered promptly. 10/10. I asked for iced cappuccino and it was delivered with liquid sugar separately. 10/10. Throughout the evening it was pleasant. When I left, I said goodbye to the front desk staff (did not know her name) and she returned her pleasantry and walk me to the door. Not bad.10/10. Would I return ? Definitely yes

It was my wife's birthday and I was deliberating where to take her out for a meal. Chanced upon Beach Road Kitchen and never looked back. Food selection was great. They have a cold room where you can feast on seafood, seafood and nothing but seafood. The hot dishes and dessert bar were also interesting. Best part was when I indicated that it was my wife's birthday, they prepared a mini cake for her! Service was great.
4
This was my second visit, the first being Father's Day dinner. The spread was unique especially with the grill section. There were whole fish, prawns, squids and clams for seafood, beef galbi, yummy lamb chops and foie gras too.The cold section was also v good with a selection of 3 types of oysters on sundays otherwise one only but v fresh nonetheless
5
Ate here from breakfast every day. They had food from every ethnic group that Singapore is known for and everything was delicious. I suggest taking a moment to acquaint yourself with the lay of the land before your first plate. Don't forget to order some fresh squeezed juice form the juice bar.
5
I hv nothing to say anymore ! PLEASE just go and eat and you'll know what's my feeling ! I'll give 9.9/10
5
I had a very good experience at Beach Road Kitchen! They had a very wide selection of seafood, served in different styles, raw oysters, fresh lobsters, grill fishes, grill mussels, grill clams. All very fresh and very appetizing! I was stuffed from all the savoury food. But just can't skip the sweets! Yummy Ice Cream Sandwich! And the staffs was very attentive! I was celebrating my 5th Anniversary with my girlfriend and they was nice enough to prepare a mini cake for us! We totally enjoyed ourselves
5
Had a great time and would definitely recommend everyone to try out the truffle pizza! Would like to especially thank Ali for the best service
4
Love the seafood spread and the food variety available. Just need to top up another $29++ for free flow of wine of consumer's choice. Worth every single cent...
1
Totally disappointing. Run-of-the-mill spread, and hardly anything tastes decent. Seafood selection was limited and tasted i fresh. Hardly topped up especially the sashimi. Service was bad - curt response and blank expressions.
5
4th visit and still amazed by the consistent super service and food. my nephews are very particular on food and they had such a good time that they will go again when they can. the variety are good for all. I personally prefer dinner to lunch as the ambience in the evening is fantastic and able to have conversation with friends without having loud music and shouting ourselves. keep up the good work knowing it is not easy when comes to service
3
Cooked food variety quite limited. Seafood was very fresh and good quality. If no promo or discounts is not worthy
5
First time here and found out that the spread here was amazing.seafood here was wow amazing specially the grill fresh fish andbother seafood item. Chef serving them to the table upon ready. Good place, will return soon
5
Having an amazing dinner with friends in beach road kitchen. There are varieties of delicious food, nice environment and good service here! I will definitely come back agai
4
They are new and try very hard to impress. The food quality is very good and the service is outstanding. Affable and sweet Sous Chef Felix came around with a cheese cart sharing their really really good cheese selection. He was helpful and eager to share all the yummy surprises available. I highly recommend him.The atmosphere is busy, exciting yet the space doesn't feel cramp. You can have a good conversation while enjoying your personal hunt for food without feeling rushed or anxious. Great place to bring your friends and family and even your colleagues for meetings. They have a section where they can seat larger groups. There's definitely something for everyone.This place seems to be perfect for the meat eaters. They have a very good station serving freshly made beef steaks, lamb cutlets, etc. That counter is forever bustling. Oh yes, they also have a beautiful pizza oven right in the middle of the restaurant baking up fresh pizza for you to sample.Only one thing: Vegetarians/ Vegans/ gluten-free peeps might feel a bit left out. There are food for you but the selections are small compared to omnivores
5
It was our first time and we were amaze with the quality of food here. Everything is freshly prepare from seafood, meat and oven pizzas. Plus, not to forget the excellent service!
5
Organized a company lunch at Beach Road Kitchen because of the good reviews and also the novelty factor, since it was just opened not long ago. Mr Johnny Jong, the F&B sales manager was very responsive to my emails and even came down personally on his day off to ensure that the event ran smoothly. All the other staff, from the manager to the waiters were friendly and attentive. I must say it has been a long while I have enjoyed such good service in Singapore where the rapid turnover of wait staff often results in inadequately trained servers. Their ready genuine smiles and unobtrusive but attentive service really left a favourable impression on my colleagues. The lunch buffet was priced at 58++, which, for its quality and variety, was reasonable, compared to other similar hotel buffets. My colleagues waxed lyrical about the grilled lamb and satay, and the tiramisu. The restaurant also tried to include more unusual and interesting fare, and even as a vegan , there were quite a few options available, like the well-stocked salad bar. My only wish was that they could include a vegan ice cream or sorbet... after all they also offered gluten-free cookies! Thank you to the great team at Beach Road Kitchen who made the lunch event a success!
5
The overall spread is not as wide as other buffets but the focus was on the quality of the food choices in the spread. The seafood and grills were of exceptional quality. The service was a little bit lacking though because of the shortage of staff
5
Food and service in restaurant was excellent Special care from Ali Strongly recommended Try the fresh see food
5
Impressive spread of food, nice ambiance and great service staff! Highly recommended group gatherings as they have a bigh table for about 10 pax. Will definitely go back again
5
Nice n fresh seafood on the grill, esp the halibut n rainbow trout. Variety is also wide. Service rendered in excellent. Keep up the good Service
5
Food variety is colorful, wide n fresh, esp. the bbq halibut n rainbow trout, which are rarely included in a buffet. Service provided in at its best, special thanks to Mr Ali for his excellent service provided. Kudos to his team
5
Exceptional food presentation, very large selection of food and the noodles were to die for. My family ate brekfast and dinner for the entire time in Singapore.
5
Spoilt for choice with the variety of antipasti. Enjoyed the foie gras and iberico pork at the grilling station. Ended off my meal with the rich dark chocolate ice cream and cakes
4
Located on the ground floor opposite the hotel, we walked into the restaurant whose passage opens up to either tables near or away from the buffet spread. If having the buffet or ala carte dishes is what you came for, it is best to mention it to the hostess before you are seated.Ordering from the menu comprising of western and asian dishes is made easier with photos of some of the dishes. It would be good to have the names of the dishes by the side of the photos for easier reference though.The pizzas are of a good size for one person. Ask for the type of fish and how it is cooked if it is the Daily Market Fish Special you are looking to order. My lunch companion preferred not to the have the bacon with her Signature BRK Club. The kitchen graciously substituted it with chicken slices. Periodically, the service staff came around with dishes for the patrons to sample. One such dish was the Suckling Pig, and it was craved by your table-side.Service was good and non-intrusive. What would be a nice touch is to have the service staff come by to inquire if everything was to our satisfaction
5
Went there last night.2nd visit.1st visit was 4 months ago. Glad that the service and food still maintain very good standard.Special mention to Kush at the grill station. The foei gras is delicious.Ali and his team was great as well. Attentive and sincere
5
A big thanks to the Managemnt and staff at this fine establishment. The fresh, varied food was delicious. What is most striking is how service has been placed front and centre to make it an 'experience' rather than yet another buffet offering. Loved the crisp salads, wonderful local offerings aside international favourites. We all thoroughly enjoyed it and will be taking our families soon. Thank you BRK
5
We had 3 breakfasts here as guests of the hotel (it was included in our rate - otherwise it's 30US$ per person).I think it's safe to say that those were probably the best breakfasts we've ever had.Everything in the restaurant was amazing.The selection was truly incredible with one of the largest buffets we've ever seen.The presentation was mind-blowing (see attached photos).The quality of the products was amazing.The dishes were all tasty.And last but not least - the service was impeccable.Highly recommended!!
3
Beautiful restaurant with many nooks to discover your food.Cooked food was okay. No outstanding dish.The amazing part is the cold room where you pick cold seafood, oysters etc plus other cold items.Overall still pretty good and think they will get better after working out the kinks in their quality and service
5
We went to Beach Road Kitchen on a Saturday night, was expecting a crowded night but to our surprise, it was very quiet. maybe because JW Marriott is still new but I appreciated that quietness here :) The design of restaurant is definitely contemporary & modern, from how the food were displayed to how the food was prepared. A lot of creativity are done by Chef (it must be). Especially love their dessert. - must try!One last thing i truly impressed was the service! My 4 years old son was just too active, not only messed up the dining table, he puked on the sofa chair, and even broke a china saucer. Sorry if anyone can imagine how embarrassed we were as parents... :( or annoyed anyone. I thanked the waiter who offered us a clean new seat and gave us a warm smile in return of my naughty son's behaviour. it's JW Marriott which always maintain the high level of service quality and in its all deliverabl
5
This was my first visit to South Beach Kitchen. It was a very nice quiet environment. The three of us ordered A La Carte. The food was very well presented and the cooking was excellent. Service was very thoughtful as all our meals arrived together. Overall a very positive memory and we hope to return soon
2
Today is my third time visiting this restaurant. I went back again because food is good and all of the staff including a Chinese chef (who comes out to help his colleagues) are extremely friendly (even Natasha from front desk was so helpful).However not this trip anymore, I met 2 men in suit while dining in the restaurant. A guy in black blazer (Ali) together with another guy in blue suit and brown shoes (no name tag but he's the only one wearing that) who is using his phone like most of time texting, even hiding in 1 corner of restaurant (behind the grill area) to sms. 2 gentleman wearing so nice yet so slack. I see the diners moving around more than this 2 guys.During my phone reservation which I spoke to chinmaee (sorry if I spell wrongly), she asked me if I'm celebrating some occasion and I was really impressed as I asked why as I told her is for my father birthday. She say she can give a surprise cake for us. (For your info it didn't came) until my sister went to ask for it (she didn't know of the arrangement from chinmaee and Ali brought 5 slices of cut cake (from the desert corner + 1 candle).Clearly theres miscommunication and staff underdelivered. To make things worse this restaurant do not give parking coupon despite lots of banners around the hotel and carpark showing free $5 parking when you spend $50. Very disappointing experience today, will not go back and I believe the last reason is one reason why this restaurant is still not crowded or packed during wkends or holidays. Personally, staff like Ali and the blue blazer guy SHOULD BE REMOVED who makes no effort to make their guest happy.
5
Excellent fresh seafood selections. Great service from the team. Thank you Siva, Ali, Rafi and chef Jason for the wonderful experience.
4
Had a great dinner with friends last week. Beach Road Kitchen offers extensive buffet spread.Have to give credit to the staff there, particularly Ali, Steven & Sai for making our evening an enjoyable one with their good service
4
Full buffet with excellent grill/BBQ beef ribs, meats, prawns; good genuine local cuisine such as laksa and Hainanese chicken rice; Chilli crab; North Indian curry; seafood starters such as fresh oysters, lobsters, crabs. But what made this restaurant really worked for us - a party of 14 diners - was the extra mile that the staff went to meet our requests. For example, lamb was not part of the roast meat selection and as of our guests do not eat beef and wanted lamb, attendant Chef duly prepared some wonderful lamb cutlets for us. Restaurant also catered to our request for a coconut jelly dessert which used to be on the buffet menu. Staff such as Thiva, Muthu and Ali were eager to please and pleased us they certainly did
5
Very unique and extensive selection of seafood. Food was really good on the whole, except more work is needed in the dessert section. Waffles definitely needs re-working.Service was impeccable, especially by Wing, who was attentive to our needs the whole evening. She added that extra touch to the whole dining experience.
5
Quality of food is excellent. Seafood are fresh and well made. Lot of different types food to choose and satisfy your craving
5
The buffet spread was lavish. Quality of the meats was excellent. We were celebrating a birthday and the restaurant provided a lovely complimentary cake. Staff were also very helpful and hospitable
4
This is my 2nd visit to Beach Road Kitchen and the food selection and service level was just as good as the first dinner I had about a month ago. Although there was some commotion at the entrance which I felt should be dealt more discreetly.The juices and wines on display should include pricing as most diners assumed that it's part of the buffet.Overall I would rate this buffet highly as one of my go to places for their foie gras, cheeses and charcuterie selection
4
Beach Road Kitchen has impressive antipasti selection in the whole room by itself! But the main highlight that everybody loves is their "Grill Station"! I also enjoyed their signature mushroom pizza with truffle paste!Overall the food quality was actually much better than I expected. As for the desserts, they were exquisite in appearance but tasted decent. Hope the pastry chef can improve the taste of the dessert to bring up the overall quality. Most people loves to see Tiramisu at the dessert station so I wanted to highlight this: I was quite disappointed with the Tiramisu here as the mascarpone cheese was way over creamy that you can't even taste any espresso inside. I can hardly find any sponge finger too, there wasn't a balance in it. Hope the chef can take note.The clearing of plates was relatively slow. But I can't really fault them on their effort as the shortage of manpower could be seen. Even the manager was quite frantically trying to clear the plates... Overall the service was still quite alright, but need to be improved.I'm Summer Loves To Eat - You can read more from my food blog

as far as international buffets go, this has one of the best and biggest spreads. not cheap but definitely worth a visit for special occasions or if you just want to treat yourself.
2
I chose to dine here with my cousin because our regular guest in the hotel where I worked recommended me to try this restaurant. The food was not bad, though as simple as lemon wedge was not available in the buffet. We loved the seafood, pizza especially the desserts. But what's disappointing was I had to asked twice for the wine before it was served. I was raising my hand to the staff to catch their attention and the gentleman on the coat (manager on duty, I supposed) looked at me and nodded but then he didn't approach our table. I waited for few minutes and raised again my hand so someone could get my wine order. I felt ignored cause the gentleman on the coat was just having a chat with his staff and didn't bother to send anyone to go to our table. Refill of water was a challenge so I went to their station and poured the water for myself. The staff who saw what I was doing just looked at me and didn't say or do anything. Like not caring at all if your customer was the one refilling her own glass of water!!! In your side station!It's a good place but having an experience where we felt ignored, It's not a place to try again.
5
Had a business dinner in this place, the seafood is extremely fresh and there are many good varieties ranging from sashimis to lobsters in the seafood section, not to mention there are other cuisines like Chinese, Indian, Italian etc. The service is excellent too, quick clearing of plates and topping up of drinks
4
We enjoyed the ambience and the food very much! Every table was given a cake for the mothers! However, 1 table away from us sat a Caucasian family, not sure why their cake is biggest and came with special wording on the plate. Like us, they also ask for the cake to be packed and got theirs in nice PAPER BAG promptly. As for ours, before we call for bill, we have to ask for our packed cake and waited awhile before it was brought out, it came with just the box and we have to ask to get a PLASTIC bag. This was the only disappointing incident, which we felt there was a racial discrimination..

Breakfast is excellent. Love the fresh coconut juice at no extra cost. Very good variety. Associates pass around small plates throughout the morning.

Service is awesome, their smile make you feel home. Food is great, I love the variety of seafood there. They serve quite a number of choice of cuisine there. Must return in future

I enjoyed a lot with my colleague during CNY. Lots of choices on seafood! nice staff and good service

The best buffet in Singapore. - thank you for the remembal evening with extraordinary delicious food selection with fresh fish for my 39's birthday. We really enjoyed this restaurant, the staff is very nice and friendly and surprise me with a chocolate cake - thank you for the great night! We will come back soon and can recommend this place to everyone with a food selection for every test and hunger

I particularly enjoyed the variety of smoked salmon, sashimi, and condiments, the oysters and scallops on the half shell seemed real fresh and were delicious. The grilled lamb chops were wonderful as was the salad bar and marinated seafoods. The lamb stew and Chinese chicken and duck were great. There were so many things we didn't try even though we ate there two or three times. Food quality was very good. The only thing I didn't like was when we ate there on a slow night and the staff gave us too much attention

Walked past this place about a month earlier and made a mental note to check it out. From the exterior, it already looked posh, comfortable and cosy all at once, with the lighting granting it a warm ambience. When the wife's birthday came around, decided to give it a shot and at SGD78++ per person, at least it would look the part. While I was fairly confident of the food range and quality just from peering in, I did not at all expect the treat we were in for. After a quick survey of what was on offer, which took a while given the number of dishes on display, we ordered two servings of fois gras on toast to start. It was cooked on the spot and was heavenly, melting in the mouth with just the right balance of flavour against the sweetness of the apple/berry compote. Thereafter, we tried the truffle pizza, which was delightful and while above average did not blow the roof off. Next up however, was the beef rendang and it was simply amazing. It broke apart tenderly at the slightest touch and the texture and flavour was just...no words can express the satisfaction. This was followed by a lamb chop that was done so well that we simply could not believe it...this felt more like a specialty steak restaurant instead of a buffet. On to the oysters, which were kept closed and only shucked open on demand - to keep them as fresh as possible. These, along with at least 30 other "cold" dishes and seafood like crab and lobster, were housed separately in the "cold room". Needless to say, the oysters were pretty spectacular.Dish after dish continued to amaze, and given the range on display, it's impossible to properly describe every dish. There are so many sections dedicated to each cuisine presented in an elegant and inviting setting. Off the top of my head, the dishes which stood out for me were everything from the roast, chilli crab, char kway teow, siew yoke, truffle pizza, beef rendang, lamb stew, make-your-own noodles, soup, full salad range made from organic vegetables, cheeses & salami, the full dessert suite and the cold room. It really is quite difficult to describe and the pictures do it much more justice.As if it couldn't get any better, the service was excellent. Our servers waited on us hand and foot, constantly changing our plates & cutlery and tending to our every request. When we walked around, the chefs explained the concepts of some dishes and the origins of the food.Overall, I think was really impressed upon me was the philosophy of the restaurant, which is to serve quality food at a decent price, regardless of the cost. There must have been over 100 items and each consistently hit the spot, with many WOW-ing us. While SGD78++ may not be the cheapest, I seriously think they are undercharging and this is honestly value for money, if there is such a thing. I cannot recommend this place highly enough. Just a tip though: Don't eat lunch before

I had breakfast with friends here and overall, it feels average. Food and coffee were nothing special. However, it is indeed a nice complex with nice ambiance.
4
We enjoyed our first visit that we decided to indulge again at this venue. The quantity and quality of the food remained unchanged with two improvements. The waiting time for shucked oysters was greatly reduced and the Boston lobster was generously available. In addition to the oysters and lobster, we enjoyed the wide selection of cerviches and marinated Italian food. The truffle pizza was deliciously thin and overflowing with toppings.We also enjoyed the thick cuts of grilled squid, medium rare tomahawk beef slices and pan-seared foie gras a-la-minute. The made-to-order laksa was a welcome spicy addition to our dinner.The dessert section offered an interesting mix of local and international delights. The pastry chef recommended her coconut ice cream, salted caramel macaron and chocolates. Special thanks to Assistant Manager Thivagaran and his team for their friendly and attentive service throughout the dinner. We look forward to dining again on our next visit to Singapore

We celebrated my sister's birthday at Beach Road Kitchen. The buffet spread came with a wide variety of food with attractive presentation. Staffs were attentive and helpful. Ali, the Assistant Outlet Manager went extra mile to prepare a surprise birthday cake despite our short notice. Thank you Ali. Will definitely go back
5
I had one of the best experience in taking my team out for diner, the service was great and the staff was extremely polite and helpful, the food selection for the buffet was great and we really enjoyed the different verities put together as they have most of the local and international flavors covered

Eating in singapore is a national past time. Buffets are just one of the many options available to u come meal time. There are a few places that come mind when one wants to indulge in a top notch buffet, think The Rise at MBS, The line at Shangri La or Triple Three at Mandarin Orchard. None I feel would come close to the quality of the food and the level of service being offered at Beach road kitchen in Jw Marriott hotel. Right off the bat, the restaurant is cozy and secluded enough such that you don't get the crowds that are normally found at other buffets. This makes for a great quiet evening away from the hustle and bustle of the city. When u enter, a wait staff greets u with a smile, shows you your table, and proceeds to take u round the restaurant to explain the various buffet items for the day. THIS is why you come to beach road kitchen. You just do not get this level of detail to service elsewhere. Throughout the meal, the restaurant manager comes by to ask if the meal is up to standards. Wait staff tops up your water regularly and brings you fresh one-off selection items like soft-shell crab from the kitchen. Buffet items are constantly replenished and u never run out, unlike some other buffets out there. As we were there for our anniversary, the manager kindly offered us a whole cake (not just a slice) for us to celebrate. Not that we could eat the cake, but it's really the thought that matters in the end. We were casually dressed and a nobody. They could have ignored us for the evening but they didn't and that spoke volumes about their level of service. It truly shines through. And the food. Gosh the food was gorgeous. A few items stood out. Lobsters were one of them. Not tiny ones mind u, but proper decent size ones that would make your date not think you're a cheapo. Crab legs were on the menu too if you ever preferred crab to lobster (why would u?!?!). They also had a fantastic grilling station and boy oh boy, you get freshly pan-seared foie gras accompanied by a fresh piece of toast here. Unlimited servings of foie gras! Now where do u find that in other buffets? On the day, we went, they had grilled prawns, a huge slab of tomahawk steak, lamb chops, scampi and grilled mini octopus as well. An excellent spread at the grilling station. If cured meats is your thing, you get a selection of 4 cured meats to pair with various cheeses and crackers as well. To be honest, it's really rare to find a buffet do everything so well. At other buffets, sometimes you get great sashimi but sucky cooked food. Other times you get great grilled meats but no oysters and lobsters. Mostly, you won't even find a proper cured meat station with an actual SELECTION from which u can choose from. Beach road kitchen does all 3 stations well and I think it really stands out for them. Wow you may say, how much does it cost then? $78++ daily. THAT is a bargain we feel. The Rise at MBS would cost almost the same, maybe even more, and you won't get food that's half as good. Almost certainly no unlimited foie gras and lobsters there I assure u. And most certainly not the service as well. We love beach road kitchen. 10/10 would return and this time, we'll be bringing company.

Came her for lunch with my friends. Buffet spread was great and service was fantastic. Managers were really on the floor ensuring that every tables are delighted.
5
Sweets selection is a heavenly temptation for the kids. The jars and jars of sweets and the dessert section was a sweet finish to the meal, and not forgetting the ice cream and the many many bottles of sauces and condiments!Food selection was adequate. Aesthetics of food presentation was lovely even at the salad bar and smoked salmon. Best of the live stations was the goose liver made to perfection!Service was also impeccable.Only regret is no Japanese section for sushi and sashim
5
Celebrate my birthday brunch there. I like : the location / the design / the food / the service Great champagne - taittinger, 148++. 100ish ++ if no alcool. Focaccia, bread, pizzas, seafood, Italian trattoria, meat. The desert buffet is top. Quality of the food is overall great. The design is great. The greenery around make the restaurant feel your in another place. The acoustic of the place is fantastic. A rare place where you can have so many people, celebrating, shouting and still being able to enjoy your brunch/diner. This is a good place for buffet brunch ! Go for it ! Special mention to the ballon guy that made me a beautiful guitar !
5
My family,my friends and children really really enjoyed our Easter season with various types of delicious food, great service and especially our kids' memorable moments with different activities such as egg painting, egg treasure hunting. Thanks for this celebration and hope to see you guys again with more other wonderful themes and different experiences over best food& best service. Keep it u

Joined the Sunday Easter Brunch with my family and friends! Simply superb dining experience!Food is fantastic. A harvest from the sea, shkwcasing the freshest seafood (oyster, salmon sashimi, lobster, prawns, crabs, etc...), a whole range of unique antipasto, cheese and cold cuts, the mouth watering truffle pizza (no joke! Its the best i ever tried), grilled food (foie gras, kalbi, lamb chop) and a perfect ending, the dessert station! The chefs are even on the move with seafood pasta and stuffed suckling pig to serve us and entertain us too. Chef Jason, Chef Charles, Chef Ravi, Chef Felix and Chef Kar Gaik! Great job!The service crew also did their fair share of job, very attentive and never fail to smile despite the huge crowd. Krishna, Greg, Jacy, Sarah all helped to perfect this day.Last to mention, a lady named Eva even offered to take my and my friend's kids to level 18 for a Easter party which they have great fun there too.Definitely a place I will recommend my friends to be back again. Well done and great job! Lovely service + Delicious food = Worthwhile dining experience
5
Fantastic breakfast, quality food items, fresh is best. Chefs are all friendly and try to accommodate my special request. Service staffs are all well trained and welcoming. Will be back ;)

We were well look after by the service team. Lots of smiles and checking in during the meal service. We were given a tub of gummies to take back for our kids! 😀
5
we are always delighted and surprised with the quality of the food and service provided, making this a truly memorable and enjoyable place to celebrate , whatever your reason. Excellent attentive staff are super friendly and always accommodating.
5
Decided to try out the buffet at Beach Road Kitchen with my girlfriend last night and we were pleasantly surprised with the quality and presentation of the selection. Everything was fresh and delicious. The wine buffet was a steal with the 3 types of wine available.I'll recommend the charcuterie and cheese selection to start and end your meal. It is by far the best I've had at any buffet.Service was attentive and friendly.Definitely coming back with friends and family in the near future for more feasting

My family n I visited many top restaurants in Singapore over the years.You name it,most likely we've tried it.We love the ambience there.I must The BBQ section on the Korean ribs is one the best I've tried so far ..great varieties of food selection n not to mention about the sweets..my children were totally spoilt for the many choices..but the only let down was the most iconic food that represent Singapore ..the Laksa !It was almost tasteless ,it does have that Lemak punch in it..I am still willing to give it another try if they are willing to improve on the Laksa receipe ...love the ambience ...a nice catch up place with friends n family no doub

Very nice restaurant with buffet for lunch and dinner, pizza were fresh and good for kids. The Lobster soup was one of the best I tried in Asia. I was addicted to it and even ordered it from room-service. I must say the fresh one I tried in the restaurant was much much better than the one I ordered in the room. The room-service soup was dried and more like a stew but not a soup! Any way I like the concept which different stands like fish, meat, pizza and ice cream
5
This is our second time at the restaurant and we are delighted that the restaurant continues to live up to its name of providing great food and great service. Special mention to shannon and Veron for been so so attentive to our needs as well as going the extra mile. Kudos and keep up the good workWe were at the restaurant to celebrate our 1st wedding anniversary and I wanted to surprise my husband with a desert and the staff went to the extra mile for a complimentary desert for us. We really enjoyed dinning at the restaurant with the wide array of food choice and ate to our hearts content. Thank you to the team at the Beach Road Kitchen
5
Beach Road Kitchen is the newest kid on the block in Singapore as far as buffet spread brunches go but it is already vying to be the best. The central location and soothing ambience are added perks to the lavish and delicious food spread that awaits the guests. Special mention to Chef Ravi and his team who have done an amazing job of creating a great selection of cuisines to choose from. The staff are courteous and attentive. Keep up the good work
5
Excellent service by staff.. Really attentive value of for value of time. I have visited with my friend and we all enjoyed everything all the fresh seafood ,saladbar , desert ,Asian counter , pizza counter.Thank you so much for nice food I am gonna visit again
5
I have been eating breakfast here for a week now. I'm staying at the JW Marriott. The service here is excellent. The entire staff is extremely attentive to your needs. The variety of food for breakfast is excellent as well. I have not had lunch or dinner here, but the breakfast is more like a brunch. They have Indian, American, and Asian food. A great fruit selection. Waffles, packages, french toasts. eggs and omelets to order. An oven with fresh pizza and other bake goods. Truly an amazing spread. A bit pricey but very good
5
The vegetarian Chinese fried rice was delicious and the chef specially catered to my request for extra bean curd and vegetables. The service was very courteous and efficient.
5
great atmosphere, amazing food- especially the seafood buffet. will definitely recommend to friends. everything was fresh. the beef cheek melted in my mouth
5
Great food and services received. Nice place! Special thanks to Chef Charles for doing up the platter for us!
5
Cannot fault the food quality and the service was what you'd expect from top-notch Singapore. Air con is way to cold and so sitting outside when it's not too humid is better.
5
Wide range of buffet menu, fresh seafood & top grade. Not to forget awesome desserts. Pleasant and friendly staffs. Efficient service rendered. Nice & comfortable ambience. Thanks to Beach Road Kitchen for the complimentary birthday cake ! 👍🏻
5
Best seafood in the town!! Good gathering with my friends. Appreciate to the service staff. Thank you for manager Thiva , Rafi & Wei lu service too. He had been check back our table more than 5times when we are having our dinner. We will be back very soon.cheers

The dinner buffet was similar in pricing to comparable upmarket venues at less than $80++ per person. It also delivered both quality and quantity of feed expected of a top buffet venue in Singapore.There were many food stations spread out around the restaurant including cold seafood, salad bar, charcuterie, carvery, Chinese roasts, noodles, pizza, hot food and dessert.Highlights included Boston lobster tails and claws, langostines, French oysters, cerviches, foie gras, duck rilette, tomahawk steak, heirloom tomatoes and ice cream sandwiched by chocolate chip cookies. We appreciate the friendly service led by the assistant manager Gregoire Corthier and from his team. Despite having few waitering staff, they still managed to clear plates and refill drinks consistently throughout dinner service. The restaurant also helped us celebrate a birthday with song and cake.The restaurant clearly needs more staff especially in the oyster shucking section.
5
I went to Beach Road kitchen and was served by a person called thiva. His service was splendid and he took care of us throughout our time in the restaurant. He came to us and asked us if our food and drinks were good and took very good care of us. I will defiantly patronise this place more often. I would only have preferred more Indian vegetarian dishes in the buffet as the choices was very limited for me as I am a vegetarian other than that everything was excellent 
5
Atmosphere was very calm in nature, wood decor and temperature was just right. Seafood was very fresh. Lobster and oysters in particular. Bakery was splendid and there are so many choices. a really pretty mozzi as well.We offered TWG for tea and nice cup of coffee for free. Manager was constantly around make sure everything is okay. Chefs there weren't posing actually they help us choose the nice food. Salad seems little dry though but overall everyone was very happy in the end with small price to pay compared what we have been offered
4
Seafood selection was good, though The popular seafood items ran out too fast and was not quickly replenished. Wide selection of smoked salmon. The pizza was lovely with its thin crust . The Cooked Meat counter was very well received. I love the Beef ribs with its tender taste. The Cooked food selection was limited . I found the chilli crab too Plain and small for my liking. The Cooked noodle station would be great for one who may enjoys wide selection , but the laksa does not taste right for me as I found it to be rather bland. Laksa should have its stronger local stronger spicy flavour. Dessert was awesome for my daughter who naturally has a sweet tooth. Selection was good, though lack my favourite chocolate cake. Overall, I found Beach Road Kitchen to be rather Good. Service was Impeccable with its polite staffs. Just a little wider selection and add-ons would make this place a more regular visit.
4
Had a buffet dinner on Saturday (18/3/2017) evening. Wide selection of raw food, decent hams and cheese. Trufle pizza is a must try!
4
Had a nice buffet spread, standard of food was good too. Their weakess section was in the desserts, not good, small range.
5
Dinner on Sunday night was very comfortable as it was a relatively quiet time slot. Would be even better if some soft drinks/juice are included in the buffet.
5
I was greeted with great customer service from the staff and great ambience with sleek interior design. There was a nice variety of food and the food tasted fantastic! The hand stretched pizza was baked freshly and I personally feel it was the highlight of the dinner. The range of seafood is extensive and the snow crab was the star among the seafood. I will definitely recommend my friends to this place.
5
Amazing new hotel. Excellent staff who made our stay memorable.The Beach Road Kitchen has a huge international breakfast, lunch and dinnerbuffet. The staff were exceptional and their services were beyond our expectations. Faizal especially was very attentive and made sure we were enjoying our meals. . We wish them continued success and recommend this hotel and restaurant to anyone visiting Singapore. We look forward to our next trip there.Thanks and best regards.F

Nice ambience. We had ala carte, buffet display does not look so attractive. Very impressed with safi and Tavi. Safi was very pleasant and served us well. Food delicious especially char Kway teow & lobster laksa. We find de ala carte pricing quite high for local n Asian food. Pizza is delicious too but restaurant ran out of chilli flakes. Tavi saved de day by getting chef to grind more. Overall good.
5
Stayed at the JW with my wife, sister-in-law and her husband.Went for alight lunch on arrival and ended eating most of our meals there. Dining there was one of the best experiences of our trip. The buffet selections included lobster, king prawns and a wide variety of local and international favourites. Desert selections were various and delicious.The staff were very friendly and helpful went out of their way to satisfy our preferences.Thiva, Kris and all the staff GREAT JOB. Thanks for the hospitality!Dee
5
Stayed at the JW and came here with business associates. They had a very diverse buffet and all of the food and dessert were excellent. They prawns and lamb chops were both very tasty and they most certainly have food for all taste. Service was terrific as well
5
Went there with my husband for dinner buffet recently and the dining experience was one of the best we've ever had! At the first glance from the outside, it may look like any other fine-dining restaurant. However, the dim yellow lighting and the open concept kitchen-like interior creates a warm and cosy ambience. Food stations are strategically located throughout the restaurant, which allows you to explore the whole place while getting your food. A wide selection of food that was really delectable. The staff there were very friendly and helpful. My husband and I were well taken care of the entire time. Overall, we enjoyed the food, the cosiness and the service. It was definitely an evening well spent;
5
My guests were impressed with the food quality and the service offered by the staffs especially Sara and Jacy. Thank you for making my guests happy.
5
Celebrated my daughter's one year old birthday at the restaurant. From the interaction with the manager Johnny down to the execution on the actual day with Krishna and Ali, every details were well handled. For example, I told the restaurant to prepare a birthday cake, and Johnny took initiative to send us a picture of how it could look like based on our brief description. The actual design turned out fabulous. On the ground, Krishna and Ali constantly made their rounds to attend to all my guests.Without saying, the buffer spread was sumptuous and the food was simply delicious. I received excellent feedback from my guests on the food quality and variety. Just look at the pictures taken as proof!If you're looking for a venue to host a party or event, i would strongly recommend this place for its food and service. It is also near to public transport which makes it even sweeter for my guests who don't drive. With nice ambience and good food, there's no better way to spend a lovely afternoon or evening dining with your loved ones.
5
Went with a friend on a weekday night. Loved the roasts and the seafood. Especially love the selection of ceviche. The staff were also very friendly and attentive without being obtrusive. Buffet spreads are seldom worth mentioning - most sacrifice quality for quantity - but would definitely return to Beach Road Kitchen again
4
My family and i have a wonderful dinner experience and i would like to compliment both Mr Ali and Mr Faizal for the attentive and good service rendered. On a separate note, the restaurant ( Beach road kitchen ) should include a Japanese section as well
5
We got greeted and whisked to our table of choice by the vibrant, lovely concierge Ms. Sarah Lorenzo. We thank Mr Thiva for the tour of the beautiful restaurant and thoroughly enjoyed the magnificent service led by the gracious Mr Krishna and his humourous partner-in-crime, Mr Shannon. The extensive spread of international cuisine from the "Salad Bar" and "Pizza Station" to the "Seafood Room" of fresh shucked oysters, salmon prepared in various ways, and "Live Stations" of Foie Gras and Steaks cooked ala minute - truly had both aesthetics and deliciousness. We felt like kids once more - trapped in a room full of candies and goodness. My only disappointment was with my glutton self for being full even before exploring the gorgeous desserts and cheese! Thank you, Chefs and the crew of BRK. We'll be back for more.... Truly a Gem
5
this restaurant is part of the J W Marriott hotel but in a stand alone building adjacent to the hotel entrance. It has been designed to featire buffets at breakfast,lunch and dinner but a la carte also available. We only ate breakfast for 3 days. The buffets are broken down into many different sections. Really extensive selection of the usual breakfast fare but with many creative choices. The hostess < Winny I think> remembered our coffee choice on the second and third day which was impressive given the number of people every day she has to greet. Service was friendly and helpful. Definitely worth a visit and I heard the lunch and dinner buffets are equally impressiv
5
Great atmosphere added with delicious seafood and attentive staff. I was served by Rafi and Thiva who constantly making sure we had everything we need. It's hard to find a nice restaurant nowadays where the staff treats you like a VIP. The best dish for me is their Lobster and Prawns. 100% recommended to all seafood lover
5
I am so glad that my friends choose this very new restaurant, it's really worth to try, with friendly staff, nice environment, great food, we just cannot stop eating. Yummy!! Especially the foie gras and fresh oysters.reasonable price, must mention the hostess Sarah with lovely smile introduce for us the buffet lines, and funny Ridzwan make us so happy, very attentive staff Shannon ,with their excellent service we had a unforgettable night Thank you very much.we will definitely come back again

I truly enjoyed the entire time of my breakfast outing with my families & friends at Beach Road Kitchen on 18th Feb 2017.I personally love hotel buffet breakfast and I cannot think of any other better way to start weekend than to start at the latest beautiful addition to Marriot brand, JW Marriot's ambitious restaurant, Beach Road Kitchen. The variety of food items are what you would expect from other luxury hotels however, the presentation makes each food item the star. They are really entertaining to view and enhance the whole ambiance & experience of the restaurant. Moreover, I felt how carefully the team considered of each guest to dine at the restaurant. For instance, each type of juice is served in a nice 250ml individual bottle and etc. Nonetheless to mention about the service, every staff was attentive and enthusiastic. I'd especially like to thank Thiva & Ravern for their hospitality and friendliness. I would definitely and highly recommend Beach Road Kitchen and would love to return not only for breakfast but also for lunch & dinner for families & friends' outing

Wonderful breakfast with great choices. Fresh Egg and Noodle station that offers interesting mix of ingredients and suggestion of egg dishes. Noodle station was interesting enjoyable; selecting the items that you would like to have in a bowl of either Spicy Prawn Base or Chicken/Vegetarian Clear Soup. You can also find a small Indian Selection of Bryani and Curries with Prata, Pastries, American Breakfast selection but also Local Delights like Dim Sum, Chicken Rice and Fried Carrot Cake. There is also a leg of baked ham and freshly pan fried sausages.Not forgetting the endless supply of fresh fruits, cold cuts and juices/drinks. Young coconut that tastes heavily; a rare find for any Singapore hotels' breakfast. Also ice cream, pancakes, waffles selection with choices for spreads and sprinkles.Kept be filled for the day
5
A beautiful array of colors and flavors! Staff friendly and service outstanding. Would have loved to eat here every morning!!!
3
A nice place to have a peaceful quite brunch. Next time I would probably opt for the ala carte menu. Buffet had generous amount of choices.
5
Part of the new Marriott Hotel this restaurant was first class. We selected the buffet which was excellent value and quality. Served well by great staff ( Shannon and Radi deserve a mention) this was the highlight of our dining experience in this trip. Optional wine supplement is great value too as the wine is very expensive in Singapore and we eventually had to ask them to stop topping us up!! Overall a great restaurant and great staff. Well done!

I need to comment that the fish n chip dish is a big flop. 1 of my client order this dish as in the menu mentioned fish, chips n malted vinegar. however, dish served with Only 3 small miserable fish nuggets n 18 fries were served on the plate! instead serving malted vinegar, black vinegar or rice vinegar were offered instead and this is a dish is price at daylight robbery price of SGD35/-++! I request FnB department of JW Marriot to serious look into this dish. Fortunately, the server who served managed to do service recovery and initiated to offer a pizza to my client which my client does not wish to have it as my client already upset over the fish n chips. we suggested for another beer for him which server did. thanks to the server who went an extra mile to do service recovery otherwise i think this would be our last visit to the restuarant
5
Had a short holiday visiting Singapore recently, and decided to try out newly open Beach Road Kitchen. Its Prove the right decicion ever made. The service render by the F&B service team, special mention ( Mr Ali, very friendly, helpful and serve with heart always, make us feel like being at home during our dinner dining. Weldone to the Chef Team as well for the delious food served. Definitely strongly recommend Beach Road Kitchen if you are looking an unforgettable best service n meal. Congratulations to JW Marriot for creating another World Class Hotel with World Class Staff. Keep it u
5
The offerings here can only be described as expansive. I had a breakfast, a lunch, and a dinner here. Each was delicious with plenty of choice for any palate. Despite the amount of food, the quality was quite good. It was nice to be able to combine local with Western fare
4
I took my colleagues out to try out Beach Road Kitchen ~ buffet Lunch. With its unique settings, food station are spread across the floor. The food quality is very impressive. Beach Road Kitchen attempts to diversify it's menu by having 'Chinese', 'indian' and 'European' food station with about two dishes each. Can't say if this is a good thing. One thing confirmed is that dessert was a bliss. Plenty of choices to choose from. The staff are also friendly. Bottom line, it's a little expensive for the food that you can eat there
4
Went there on a Wednesday night for a company dinner. The atmosphere and ambience was great. Food quality was great as well. Expected the "singaporean food stalls" to produce mediocre food but I was pleasantly proved wrong. Had a ton of steak, lobster, oysters and many other good local foods. Worth a try! For Dessert lovers you'll be in a mini wonderland with your own DIY soft-serve ice-cream, plates of pastries and tarts, macarons, chocolate roasted peanuts etc. Guaranteed bloatedness from over-eating hahaha.I've had tons of buffets in Singapore (Regular buffets to high-end ones) Beach Road Kitchen would be in my top 3.
4
I recently had dinner at the buffet of the Beach Road Kitchen. This restaurant has opened only recently. The staff (especially Ali, the maitre d'hotel) is helpful. The quality of food is very good, especially oysters and other seafood.However, being very recent, the restaurant makes some absurd mistakes. For instance, there are only very few unattractive types of cheese available in the buffet ... but there is a provocative glass cabinet displaying a great variety of different types of beautiful cheese, highly attractive, but this cabinet is locked and the magnificent cheeses are not available to the clients and the restaurant staff has no access to this locked cabinet

One of the latest addition to the buffet scene in the Suntec City-Marina Square vicinity, Beach Road Kitchen at JW Marriott South Beach Singapore is easily another eatery that can be added to your list of dining venues with good smorgasbord spread. Just opened for barely a couple of months, it is understandably quiet and not well reviewed yet. But do not be fooled by its apparent empty crowd, the food spread and quality can easily match some of the better buffets in Singapore. It may not be in the league of Colony (Ritz Carlton), Edge (Pan Pacific) or The Line (Shangri La) in terms of variety of food, but the ambience and the way the food is spread out from one end of the dining area to the other is certainly one with the diner in mind. One area that stands out is the cold room where the cold cuts, oysters, crab legs and lobsters are served. Neatly arranged, this appetiser spread is where I could easily fill half of my stomach with. Moving down from the cold room, you can find another serving area of cheeses, hams and salamis, followed by a salad counter, a noodle bar, desserts area. Further down, you will find a Asian spread of Chinese dimsums and Indian food, a wood-fired pizza counter serving thin crispy crusted pizzas and a grill counter that serves freshly grilled meats and seafoods, together with another area serving stir-fried foods like rice, noodles, vegetables and Chinese roasts like roast duck and meats. End your meal with a selection of decent coffees and TWG teas. The dessert spread has good variety of French-themed items that you should leave some space in your stomach for. Try it yourself to see what I mean. Plates clearing was initially slow when I was there but picked up half way through my meal. Staff are generally friendly and accommodating. Chefs manning their respective areas are enthusiastic in recommending their foods and their senior staffs, particularly Greg and Ali, are professional and extremely helpful.Overall it has been a great dining experience for me and being newly opened, I foresee further improvements and fine tuning to be made as the crowd builds up in future. Looking forward to another
