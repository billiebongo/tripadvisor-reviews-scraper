On level 2 of Shaw Centre. Nice tapas bar/restaurant, also with an open air terrace seating. Relatively good selection of tapas. Excellent & attentive service. However, prices are really on the high side. Well worth an evening visit
4
Cosy place serving good tapas with an ambiance that is perfect for dates and gatherings. Request for a quiet corner if you not wish the next table to hear your conversation.
5
Nice environment for celebration. The restaurant served great service and good foods. Their set lunch menu is good for value.

Went to this Spanish Restaurant for our Monthnivasry.
The staff was very friendly and service was attentive rice. The lamb rack was especially good. Meat falling off the bone.
For starters try the Pan Tumaca.

Went there for a birthday celebration. Overall the food is good and the space is cozy and classy. Prices are bit steep but you do get quality food although the amount of food per plate is more towards small. Our favorite is lobster paella too little to share with more than 2/3 but too expensive to just share with another person. Service is OK. Overall, we will be back but probably on occasions
5
We thought this will be a perfect spot for our lunch before our meeting next building. As we had one hour for lunch the restaurant was kind enough to allow us to sit and order before their opening time of 12 noon. We were given an enclosed area and orders were taken promptly. Set lunch consisting of 3 course was $35++. The food arrived promptly and presentation was great. Forgot to mention - tea/coffee included.
4
We dropped in post movie and were surprised at the high quality menu. The service was attentive and brisk and the food was excellent. Don't expect a cheap meal but the food quality justifies it. Our only gripe was being seated next to a large, drunk party but it was 10pm Saturday night so hardly surprising.

Love this place. This is my third visit..Was there to celebrate my friendâ€™s birthday and we enjoyed it for the yummy tasty food and tip top service.. from their servers to their managers.. all are attentive to serve and ensure you are well taken care of and are also enjoying their food. We had the burritos cheese, iberico pork, wagyu beef, garlic prawns and salad to share. All the food was excellent and we loved them all.. we ordered a bottle of wine and they were constantly on the alert to top up our glasses and also ensuring the flow of food are served smoothly. Will definitely be back

V. good squid ink Paella, worth the trip. For tapas- we had grilled octopus, pork, foie gras. All great. We realized we had no veggies but already too much food. Churros and ice cream, well- if you must, you must.Cava was good. Rioja below par
4
food is good, service staff is really attentive and friendly, pays attention to detail, we had a birthday dinner here, our party was well taken care of. we brought our own tart as a cake and it was served with all the proper cutlery etc, service staff were absolutely great
5
The food here is top-notch. Highly recommend the grilled dishes, the lamb and the peppers especially. Top service -- brings a welcome finish to or break in the day. 100% recommended.
4
Another resto that is part of the les amis group, but this one is on second floor of mall, rest are on the alley way. Great duck, me tapas
4
Fish fillet was good but the carrot was better.. by pear (lady)from bangkok. duck confit 7/10 well season. Air con not so cold after a beer and wine. Service is good and attentive. Yeh!!!
4
Great place for authentic Spanish food.We had a fabulous roasted quail with mushrooms & iberico. Cooked to perfection. The main course was the Dover sole. It was fairly good, but as this type of sole is considered a luxury dish, the sauce that came with it somewhat overwhelmed the delicate flavors of the sole. A pity. The best way is how the English would do it. Grilled with some salted butter & a hint of lemon. All natural. Dessert was a scoop of vanilla ice cream with poached pear in red wine. This Bristro is consistently good.Alan LeongSingapore

Can say their set Lunch is value for me. Really enjoyed all the food we had. Strongly recommend this place and do made reservation, guest start streaming in after 12pm. The seafood salad was refreshing and all are good stuff. My beef was excellent, done just right, tender. Chicken was good to. Churros was yummy with the chocolate sauce. Not so sweet. My niece complimentary chocolate cake from the restaurant was very good.
2
The food looked much better than it tasted! ... Ordered the lamb ribs ('warm tapas') ... The photo on La Taperia's website portrays a much larger portion ... The reality was 5 small ribs - rather than 7 large ones - mentioned this to the waiter, who simply laughed ... and the ribs were chewy rather than tender, were hard to digest.We decided to move elsewhere for dessert (Fat Lulus) which was much better, with better atmosphere, innovative food and better service
2
A Sunday lunch started excited but went downhill pretty quickly when food was served! The Patatas Bravas were a bit burned, Pimientos de Padron undercooked, Chiperones dipped in a batter with squid ink and the Albongidas absolutely tasteless... I'm all for creativity but Croquetas de Jamon with cheese is questionable and a Paella with melted cheese on top is anything but holistic: it's sacrilege and the worst thing since Jamie Oliver's "interpretation" of this dish! The good news is that if you've never visited Spain and don't know any better, you probably like it
4
This cosy Spanish restaurant is informal and humming with happy diners. We enjoyed our dinner experience as the service was very friendly and attentive, and the food interesting and good. The Peppers stuffed with tuna was zesty and refreshing. The Cheese n Ham Croquettes were light and crispy on the outside, well balanced. The Foiegras was delicious, with a crunchy base. The deep fried baby squid with black squid ink was spectacular! The Lamb ribs were tender and fragrant. Suckling pig was very delicious, with light crispy skin. The Duck breast was brilliant! The clams in the Seafood stew was overcooked, and the stew sadly overly salty, whilst the Paella with black squid ink could be better
4
This is a go to restaurant for me and quality has been consistent. The mussels yesterday was really fresh and juicy - thanks for the recommendation. Had the pumpkin soup for the first time and it turned out to be really hearty, tasty with lots of sliced scallops. One of the favourite dishes would be the squid ink calamari. Always light and crisp. Would love to have more daily specials as the menu is limited so the specials would add variety.
4
Had a lunch break at La Taperia. It was one of our favorite places while we lived in Singapore. It lived up to it's expectations once again....the ambience, the friendly and efficient staff and of course the food. We had gamba garlic pan fried prawns and gin & tonic....wow stuff. Their finely cut steak is also very good. We plan to eat there every time we visit Singapore
5
Went there for supper after a movie.
Seated promptly, very attentive waiter, engaging and anticipative.
The burratta in a gazpacho was phenomenal. So were the anchovies on thin toast.
For dessert, churros in chocolate sauce sound better than they actually are.
3
Great wines and faultless service as you would expect, but the food items are hit and miss, with some exceptional but some quite ordinary.
5
Third visit - the tapas and mains are excellent!✅ A bit pricy but worth it.
Especially the lamb ! ✅Be sure to book in advance- the restaurant is small and very popular. Good service too.
Will definitely return.
4
Tuck within the busy Orchard area, this place is quite relaxing. They serve good food and wine. The Gazpacho and Ibérico is good.
1
Be careful. When paying, the system of the restaurant refused 2 different master cards. The waiter came to me in a very arrogant manner saying that our cards were not working. We ended to pay with cash which was not our plan. After leaving we were for shopping and we tested both cards and were working normally as usual. They have a problem and it's the customer the one to solve their problem.......or simply they don't like credit cards. They prefer cash.

We had a positive lunch experience at La Strada and decided to taste test this sister venue. It also offered a set lunch of 3 courses with well portioned entree, main, dessert and coffee or tea at $35++ each. The good size slab of Iberico pork shoulder was lightly salted and grilled to medium. Beef carpaccio was generous without an overkill of creamy dressing. There were five pieces of tasty seared scallops. The onion soup with chicken bits and almond flakes was creamy with manchego cheese.The snails spooned over fried eggs with runny yolks Was interesting. The braised lamb shoulder was off-the-bone tender with meaty flavors. The beef ribs were equally tender. The chicken leg seemed to be roasted and then oven-baked in sauce. The vanilla flan was light and milky without being too sweet. Churros were dense and accompanied by thick chocolate sauce. The passion fruit tart was a shallow crunchy base with sharp citrus flavor.Unfortunately the kitchen's efforts were undermined by the messy order placement and table service. There was a gap of nearly 20 minutes for guests waiting on their appetizers. The same happened for mains where some received theirs and others had to wait. Despite informing the waiting staff, the problem was only fixed when we finally got hold of the manager. He apologized and fixed the problem. Unfortunately we had already completed half of our lunch. No compensation of any kind was offered.
4
The Spanish food here is fantastic but go for the set lunches which are more affordable and good value for money. For SGD35, you get a 3 course lunch + coffee or tea. The portions are good and not like some fanciful restaurant where you just suck up foam and then have to make a trip to McDonalds to fill up your tummy
4
Really enjoyed this one, quality all round from the service to the food and setting.The set lunch is great value for money too so if you're in the area and looking for some Spanish food look no further.We had the beef carpaccio (ask them to not use the truffle dressing as it over powers the beef) and the pâté for starters. For mains the iberico shoulder and land shank stew. For dessert the flan and passion fruit tart with tea and coffee!Recommended
5
Was there on a lovely Saturday afternoon for birthday lunch treat for two close friends.The restaurant has a cozy setting and servers are attentive and friendly.We had the set lunch of choice of 1 starter, 1 main meal and a dessert valued at a great price of $35++.The manager was really great in service offering prior suggestions on their most popular dishes of starters and mains before our full group arrived. It helped in letting us make fast decisions on what we will order.It's really great value for such yummy fine dishes. We enjoyed tremendously all the dishes we ordered.We were told of this month promotion with OCBC card of 3 order of set lunches, you get 1 set lunch free. It helped that we have 8 pax so we got two set lunches free. Yay!!I will definitely be back for more meals
4
First time visit with friends. Delicious tapas and extremely attentive service especially the manager William. Really like the lamb and duck. We also ordered Spanish Green Peppers which is not on the menu which is also delicious. About S$60 per pax without wine which is pretty reasonable.
4
Recommended by a friend we went to test the restaurant. Nice welcome! After sitting down we felt our neighbours where very loud and we asked to change the table. No problem, we got a nice table in a kind of séparée. The food was good. We had a selection of taps including the lobster paella! Together with two bottles Spanish White Wine! Les Trois Amis. My friends like to drink! Price is reasonable for what you get. Will go there again

Although tucked away along a long corridor on the second floor in the newly renovated wing of Shaw Centre, the La Taperia is not difficult to find. Established 2 years and 4 months ago on October 2014, this Spanish outlet by award wining Les Amis group is just the venue for either a quick meal, a romantic night out, for chilling out with the guys or a business lunch. Affordable booze, tapas and piped Spanish music, a warm decor comfortable seats and dim lighting sets the mood for a fun-filled gathering or private intimate dining. Framed Spanish posters fill the walls, and displays of wine bottles and glasses very much create the mood.We had lunch at La Taperia and selected the Set Lunch Menu as this seems the best value for your buck. Amongst the selection of 8 Appitisers, 8 mains and 6 deserts, we shared the Marinated White Anchovy salad with mesclun, fine bean, green olives, soft-boiled egg & tomato vinaigrette and the Beef Carpaccio with soft-boiled egg, manchego cheese, toasted pine nuts & truffle aioli dressing. For the mains, we shared Grilled Spanish Iberico Pork Shoulder with apple, brussels sprouts & smoked bacon and the Free Range Chicken Leg slow-cooked in Spanish beer. For deserts, we had Churros with cinnamon sugar & chocolate sauce, Sorbet of forest berries. The 3 course set menu costing $35.00 plus plus includes coffee or tea.The service was attentive, polite and efficient. I note that after the appetisers, the waitress changed our plates, and again before our deserts. When clearing our plates for deserts, she also wet wiped the table to clear any spilled sauces. We asked for serving spoons and were given appropriate cutlery for each dish. Some customers would take these all for granted, but it’s attention to small details like these that make the grade!The food was good on all counts. I found the appetisers well seasoned, and the flavors well balanced. The white anchovies were halved, and not salty at all, pairing well with the tartness of the green olives. The chicken meat was very tender, and literally falling off the bone. Well seasoned and delicious. The Iberico Pork Shoulder was slightly tough, and at one end slightly undercooked. We liked the Sorbet of forest berries which had the strong flavour and acidity of the berries and the grittiness of berry seeds. I found the Churros crunchy but slightly oily.There’s an extensive wine list;11 different whiskeys and 6 types of liqueurs including Tequila to choose from. Toilets are outside the restaurant, to your left as you exit and near the escalators. It’s wheel chair friendly. Lot’s of baby high-chairs noted at the entrance. No free WiFi.La Tapreia is located at 1 Scotts Road, #02-10/11 Shaw Centre, Singapore 228208. Tel: 6737 8336 if you wish to call in to make a reservation. I made my reservation on-line through their website

After hearing a lot about this place, decided to give it a try recently. Avoided the set meal (possibly a mistake) and went for a la carte (my friend wanted to try the paella, which was not part of the set). The squid-ink paella was...different. It was charred and stuck to the pan; we had to literally scrape it off. Furthermore, the prawns were rubbery, tasteless and uncooked. While I am not a big paella fan to begin with (and certainly not an expert), it is possible that this was the worst paella I have ever had. The only decent thing we had were the mozzarella sticks that we tried as appetisers

I am travelling round the world for almost 30 years and therefore have eaten in many, many places but tonights dinner is for sure amongst my top 3. Everything was perfect from the moment i reserved the place (i was informed that i got the last table, near the kitchen, then got a confirmation via email and even a phone call to confirm again) until we left the restaurant (the chief called me by my Name which he could only know through my reservation). The service was fast, efficient and friendly in a very easy and natural way. We ordered a variety of tapas and we got them, without asking, not all of them together but one after another so that we could enjoy it. The quality of the food is very good. If you order Tapas try the thin french baguette which comes toasted...yummy.At the end i asked for a Carajillo (black coffee with spanish Brandy). Although its not on the menue they did it for me. Just perfect.I cant wait to come again and suggest this place to my friends

Went here on a Saturday night with my wife and had a very pleasant meal. Good service throughout, the place was packed and every dish we ordered came out above expectations. Few things to improve on: the timing of dishes could have been better (our first serving of dishes were all our carbs: patatas bravas, pan con tomate & croquetas, 2nd serving was only mushrooms, last serving took 30mins for our final tapas plate of steak). It would be better to serve out in quicker succession and more cohesive. We also had 3 to 4 waiters repeatedly coming to our table asking if we wanted to buy more drinks or want more ice water. Bit disruptive so assigning fixed waiters to "zones" would be more pleasant.Price is on the high side for both food and wine and hope they'll add more veggie dishes to balance it out better. Recommended though and we'll def be back

Expectations were high, as La Taperia is part of the Les Amis group and we were not disappointed. We went as a party of six for dinner on a Saturday evening. When we arrived at 8 pm, the place was buzzing with a positive vibe - there was a party in the wine cellar and others were dining on the balcony. Despite this, service was prompt. We decided to have an ''all-tapas" dinner with just one main. The outstanding tapas were:ANCHOAS EN PAN DE CRISTAL - an anchovy fillet on a bed of finely chopped tomatoes on crystal bread, drizzled with garlic and olive oil. Simple, yet flavourful, the saltiness of the anchovy nicely balanced by the sweet, piquant tomatoes. CROQUETAS DE MANCHEGO- Croquette of manchego cheese bechamel. A surprise hit with all - was voted as best tapa by our party.PULPO A LA GALLEGA - octopus in Galician style. Served on potato slices, the octopus was firm, without being chewy. ALBÓNDIGAS EN SALSA IBÉRICA - meatballs (mixed meat) in chorizo iberico sauce. Fork tender meatballs and truly yummy sauce - makes you want to lick all the sauce off the dish!COSTILLITAS DE CORDERO A LA PARRILLA - grilled lamb rib confit with honey mustard sauce. Tender meat, dropping off the bone with a fantastic sauce. Our main was SUPER-COCHINILLO CONFIT - a suckling pig confit with peaches and caramelised onions. While good, we probably were already satiated and impressed by the tapas and hence did not find this dish that outstanding. For drinks - we took a jug of Sangria Tinto - very worthwhile as it gave us 8 glasses.The maitre di was very informative and advised us NOT to order extra bread - which was good advice (it would have just filled us up with empty calories!) Looking forward to our next visit
4
Came here with two friends after a meeting nearby. We arrived at 6.30pm when restaurant just opened. There is already no seat left in the air con area - all tables are reserved. We sat in the open balcony area of the area which was perfect for us - not too cold or hot (fan above) or rowdy. We ordered some tapas to go with beer and white wine: cheese and ham croquette, ham platter, mushrooms, gambas (prawns), meat balls and fries. Have to wait a bit for the food but quality of food is good, service is good and ambience is relaxing. The only weird thing is there is a metal bar that is in middle of the high table that kind of block you and the person opposite. Overall a good recommendation from my friend! Reservation is probably advised given the popularity of this restaurant.
5
Once you step into the premises, you can forget that its tucked away in a shopping centre because of the decor and warm, friendly staff! Three of us were here on Saturday night, we rated the clams and octopus tops, followed by exquisite duck liver. The tomatoes, well, they were transformed into deliciousness. The house special that night - Cod did not disappoint but well, cod is cod - was the overall verdict. Beef cheek sliders were good, only the jamon croquettes was a bit of a let down. They were tasty alright, we could see but not taste the jamon.Sangria was very refreshing and a generous serving at that. And then we shared the churros - we called it Chinese donut- yew char kway that comes with chocolate sauce. I embellished it with vanilla ice cream! There were a generous 5 sticks of churros, more than enough to share!In all, a very lovely evening of varied tastes
5
Went back to La Taperia for lunch with a visiting guest and some friends. First they consented to letting us use their wine cellar room: nice and cosy for six of us. We had mainly tapas and they were delicious. The service was immaculate and personal. The restaurant is not very large but appropriately intimate: you can see what the next table has ordered and then tempted to try it too. They also have a balcony area which can host a party of more than 10 people. Good job; keep it up

La Taperia was one of the many restaurants under the Les Amis group. It offered spanish cuisine, different from the other sister restaurants.Although dim in lighting, the restaurant had a warm and cozy feel, which attracted a number of family style diners here. The staffs here were friendly and easy going.The restaurant offered 3-course lunch set at $35++. Recently I found that Maybank was offering a 1-for-1 set lunch promotion and decided to take up the offer.For appetisers, there were 10 choices available. We were served crusty baguette to go with it.Chef's Signature Style Gazpachowith Hass avocado, white tuna & quince jellyThe cold soup was thick and creamy, while tasting refreshing.Pan-Seared Duck Liver (topup $6++)with muscovado glazed Calanda peaches & mesclunThe duck liver were 2 huge slabs, which simply melt in the mouth. The peach was juicy sweet. And the mesclun was tossed in a refreshing sweet dressing.There were 8 choices to choose from for the Mains.Braised Lamb Shoulderwith tomatoes & artichokesThe lamb was fork tender and melt in the mouth, especially the fatty parts. It did not have the usual gamey taste nor the tough texture associated with lamb. It was filled with chunks of carrots, but did not see any artichoke in it.Seafood Saffron Noodle Paella (topup $10++)includes prawn, squid & crab meatIt was like well braised bee hoon, soaking up the flavours from the juicy scallops, prawns and squids, served in a hot pan.Desserts, there were 6 choices to select from.Orange Crema Caramelcustard & orange segmentSimple in look, but rich creamy orange taste.Churroswith cinnamon sugar & chocolate sauceThe churros was light and crisp, without too oily.Overall the food was delicious and full of flavours. Not wonder the place was packed even for a slow lazy lunch time
5
This is the best Spanish restaurant we've found in all the years of visiting Singapore.
Food is amazing and service efficient and friendly.
Got 2 days left and will definitely be back.
4
Had dinner with my wife, tapas was excellent, squid in ink, soft shell crab, mixed meatballs, all well presented and reasonably well priced for Singapore. Red wine by the glass very good, although expensive by Aussie standards. Service from waiter and maitre d, very good.
5
I have been here for two times and La Taperia has never let me down so far! Tried their lunch menu today. The roasted iberico pork is very tender and juicy. Scallop from appetizer was really good! I'll go back again for sure!
5
A true spanish experience. Restaurant lost in a shopping mall, small and cozy atmosphere with a nice terrace. Being portuguese and knowing well the Spanish cuisine I could confirm that it feels like home. Nice service, good wine list (need to try the Alion) and a nice variety of tapas and mains. OlÃ©!
5
Food (set lunch)Spanish Tapasto die for squid ink calamari, a definite must try!surprisingly good steakspork dish a bigger surprise, probably the best i've tasted best churros in townexcellent coffeeServiceIf you want unexpectedly great service, this is it! Mus and his service staff were amazing! It was birthday celebrations, nice touch with the candle on the churros and Mus remembered squid ink calamari was my favourite and surprised me with it. AmbienceFeels like a Spain in a Singapore shopping mall ;) Nice alfresco area, still can't believe i'm in a mall.This place has an interesting private area for small groups.Bonus: Set lunch are great value! Fine dining at mid prices
5
Growing up in the Philippines, I was spoiled for choice when it comes to Spanish tapas. After living in Singapore for 8 years, I think I finally found my new tapas place - La Taperia. Dined with hubby during one of our date nights. I booked through Chope and got a quick confirmation from the staff. Once we arrived, I was surprised that the manager greeted me by name and had a nice table for us in the veranda. We ordered our usual jamon with bread and tried their cuchinillo for mains. Everything was superb and service was top notch. Can't wait to go back!
5
Service absolutely excellent; attentive, responsive, always with a smile. The crsispy black black squid, the prawns so fresh that you love to eat. The Paella with the lobster oh so sweet. The wagyu, now this is what you call meat.Forsooth tis the beauty of this individuality that I wax lyrical.
5
While there are a few other well known tapas places in Singapore, La Taperia is very understated and conveniently located at Shaw Centre which is at the heart of Orchard. William is a top notch manager ensuring excellent welcome and service. The food is like in Spain. A must try place.
5
Went with hubby for a very good lunch today @La Taperia. We chose the set lunch menu as it was the first time we dined at La Taperia. The food didn't disappoint and all the 3 courses turned out delicious. For starters, I had the Rockmelon with Joselito Paleta, the rockmelon was very sweet which complemented the jamon very well. My main course was Spanish Chorizo Pork Sausages, loved the spiciness of the sausages, enjoyed dipping the crispy bread into the sauce with lentils. My dessert of Churros was so delish that even hubby couldn't resist but helped himself to it! :) Couldn't ask him for his commends on the food as he was too busy "polishing off his plates" !Service was top class, very friendly, really made us feel very at home. The manager came over to check on us a few times on how is everything? the food ok with us? etc.Really recommend La Taperia and definitely we will go back
5
Such a nice and quiet place with Lovely food and amazing service.We had a full dinner made up of tapas and we were full at the end !!! If you go there, also try the white sangria ;-)This restaurant is a bit hard to find, more signage would be helpful.
5
Loved the food and the service. Seafood tempura and salad were best. bruschetta cold have been better.
3
Spanish tapas fare is served here.. while the concept is about right.. the tapas did not quite taste to what we had elsewhere..
2
Food was average at best, much better Spanish options throughout Singapore. Sangria and service were subpar. Location is rather random, tucked upstairs inside one of the many malls.
5
The Les Amis touch of excellence shows very clearly in the extra level of service at la Taperia. Friendly, engaging and efficient. The food is also quite good. We were there for a small bite, as we had just done with their sister Caveat downstairs. We promptly made reservations for a full meal for next week.Conveniently located at Shaw centre, so you can eat before/after catching a movie
5
We come here often, but this time went with the kids. Had a great window table near the kitchen. The food was excellent as always, the ribs fantastic. The kids love the Jamon and the Pan con Tomate (and the chips). We enjoyed a few tapas dishes. One of the few places we can get great Albariño wine. Highly recommended. Always full of people. Booking suggested.
4
Tried to dine on a Friday night, but with no reservations, we couldn't get a table. Then we tried again on a weekday night where there were less people.Great service! The staff will recommend and advise if we ordered too much. Good food too! Will definitely return to try other dishes
4
It's a small place with seats quite close to each other so it's not really what we would call a fine dining place but more a bistro. The tapas were mostly great but I was not a fan of their cold ones.My girls raved about their churros as well.They do great set lunches too
5
Popped by on Sunday evening as a party of four. We were offered a table near the front, but chose one next to the restaurant pass so we could watch the show. The manager helped guide us through the menu, and we went with most of his suggestions. That probably ensured we ended up with the dishes they are most proud of, but we didn't feel we were being aggressively up sold. Service was very attentive throughout the meal - regularly refilling water glasses, clearing serving equipment, and replacing plates & cutlery; all things you would expect, but easy to over look - especially in a tapas restaurant. This is not a "throw & go" restaurant - each course is fired separately and they seem to take pride in scheduling a sequential flow of dishes - even for long lead time items like Paella. Prawns in garlic was excellent! The amount of food was just right and left room for a soufflé that wasn't on the menu. Overall, a great, reasonably priced, casual dinning experience. We will be back
5
We don't normally go for Spanish food but tried out this place. To our pleasant surprise, the food was excellent not to mention the service. We had their specialty for the day cold tapas burrata cheese with fresh tomatoes. Very refreshing. Their house specialty for warm tapas would be the fried egg with fried shaved potatoes. Of course a must is their churros. Great Spanish food.
4
Plenty of options on the set lunch menu. We had the goats cheese & beets salad and the white asparagus & scrambled eggs. For mains we had the NY strip and a paella. Then cheese for desserts. Food was amazing, house pour wine was very drinkable and the service was excellent. $35++ for the set menu, our bill was a lot more because of the wine. Definitely going back
4
Overall a very delightful and enjoyable dinner. One of the best Spanish dinner I had in In Singapore. Great service and ambience.
5
Nice tapas and appetizers. Fresh and friendly environment.
Staff was friendly and helpful. We asked and have been seated in separate/partitioned big room, despite it was 2 of us and the restaurant was not full.
Highly recommend for friendly dinner with colleagues, etc.

The suckling pig was the star, crispy outside, so tender and tasty meat it melted in my mouth. Seafood stew was awesome with saffron shrimp bisque sauce. Burrata cheese with balsamic glaze and cold red bell pepper squce was another star. Stew chorizzo with beans was awesome too. Last but not least the chicken and sausage paella was delicious. Brilliant lunch!
4
In the last year and half since its opening, La Taperia has been improving a lot. There are some excellent, creative dishes, even if they are not purely Spanish (eg.a delicious burrata on a bed of gazpacho with momo tomatoes; wagyu beef; lamb ribs; etc). The more traditional Spanish dishes (eg. paella, croquettes, gambas) are good, but not as well executed as at the top Spanish eateries in Singapore. The service team - well trained from other Les Amis group's outlets like Casa Verde - is friendly, helpful, and pro-active
4
This is another restaurant which is part of the Les Amis Group. Our family of 4 had set lunch here last week. I had suggested this place for lunch as I had attended a private party here some time back and thought the food was good. Set lunch here cost SGD35++ for an app, main, dessert and coffee or tea. Some choices require a top up. eg, $6 for duck liver app or Hokkaido scallop app, and $10 for steak main. Among us, we had the onion soup, duck liver and Hokkaido scallop for app. Everyone loved what they had. For main, our kids had the steak, my husband had the lamb stew and I had the roast kurobuta pork rack. All of us agreed that the kurobuta pork rack was the best. Pork is generally dry but they have done this beautifully. But note that it is very fatty meat, so not for those who only take lean meat. Dessert was very simply. We had sorbet and ice cream and chocolate cake among us. They don't just serve coffee from a pot which most restaurants serving set lunch do. We could choose a speciality coffee like latte or cappacino. Overall, we felt it was a good value set lunch for the quality of food offered. Service was good too. We had an enjoyable meal
4
Service is very friendly ! The ham is of a very good quality , so are some of the tapas dishes ( anchovies, meat balls etc) but , in line with Les Amis ' group of restaurants, the whole meal does not come cheap ! Good wines ( the Chardonnay and the Rioja by the glass were very good). I however don't understand how they managed to burn the paella to a very dry dish ? Tasty but dry ? Good experience overall. On the pricey side though

Hi all, I don't want to take all the wind out of the sails of the previous reviewers, as it's cool that there is some alternative cuisines trying to make it in Singapore and that should be encouraged. After two weeks in Asia we were also looking for a change from the regular. This it is, but despite the attention to detail from the chef/s that is obvious, $195 for a family of 4 with 5 tapas dishes and 5 beers at $10 a beer (330ml) is stretching the value in anybody's language. And to cap it off the Chicken and chorizo paella was extremely average. A nice change, but the value equation needs a review

Had second dinner at this spanish restaurant in shaw centre. good selection of ala carte menu and wine selection. should try the squid ink paella which had very nice rice burnt crisp "Fan Jiu". Also had the beef which was very well done. Good value for money

Located at the second floor of Shaw Center, La Taperia is not found easily unless you have heard about it. Therefore in Singapore it is a great location to have a quiet lunch and dinner. Food are delicious with very carefully presented dishes and staff are well trained. Choices of Cold and Warm Tapas, Paella, Meat Menu are good and you will be happy with waht you can enjoy. Good place to bring a small group of friends

Excellent food, attentive service, good quality-price ratio. I love it! Don't miss the churros, simply to die for.

Great little gem, it feels tucked away in the renovated Shaw Centre but it's not hard to find on second floor.Great little dishes, we washed it down with house reds, whites and beer. Spanish wines are very drinkable. about 8 dishes with paella at the end was enough to fill us, but I'd prefer more vegetable offerings too.Ambience was great if a little noisy. The terraza looked attractive but was full with smokers

Good Spanish Tapas Food in Orchard Shopping District. We at as a table of 6 with local family. The host was very friendly and we enjoyed a bottle of Spanish Rose while waiting for the other family to arrive.Stand out dishes were lamb ribs, mushroom dish with poached egg and Spanish sausage and the wagyu beef. Paella was a tad disappointing flavour wise.Overall I would happily dine again

Every single dish has been delivered with absolutely high quality! The service has been splendid. The restaurant is small so please make reservation ahead of time. The wine is probably the best balance between price and taste. This is a must-go if you visit Singapore! Recommend the dishes in the photos

Been there the first time upfront to our family cinema experience.La Taperia itself is a little hidden inside the Shaw Center. Nicely decorated and warmly greeted we were seated on high chairs. We decided for the 3 course lunch set with was a choice of 4-5 different dishes of each one appetizer, main and dessert. Each course was really well done - had mussels on salad with a nice vinaigrette, the carch of the day (rainbow trout) and crusty apple pie.. My wife went for scrambled egg with bacon, asparagus, mushroom n truffles and seafood paella. Food was very nice and very reasonable at sgd 35++ for this lunch set. We had an extra dessert for our son which was a special iced chocolate marquise with toasted almonds (super yummy). All over a very nice experience and an excellent decent and attentive service. Will go again - next time for the tapas.

Found this place on Tripadvisor when we were trying to find a nice meal close to our hotel that wasn't ridiculously overpriced (and we wanted something besides hawker food, we'd been eating it the whole trip pretty much). The restaurant is nice and cozy and I really liked the atmosphere. The manager is actually from Spain also, I think? (His accent sounded like it, but we didn't ask so I'm not 100% sure) The menu has a nice selection of traditional Spanish tapas, but our favorite by far was the rabo de toro. It was cooked in a really nice sauce that almost reminded me a bit of a Mexican mole sauce and it was fantastic. The prices were on par for what we'd pay for similar food at home (actually maybe even a bit less). The service was excellent as well. Would definitely come back here if we are staying in the area again

I was there for lunch with a friend and we went away very happy with the food we had. The tapas were excellent, but it was certainly not a cheap lunch for 2 at S$120 (no drinks) :) They do have a set lunch menu though. I will certainly go back and try their paella for dinner. Corkage is one for one (you can bring a bottle with no corkage when you buy one bottle)

We were looking for a Tapas dinner and we found this restaurant...not many reviews, but encouraging, so we tried.Small place and not so easy to find, since it is inside a mall, first floor.All the dishes that we ordered were extremely good and well cooked, some of them near in quality to the ones I had in Spain.Their Jamon was fantastic, as well as the Gambas, the squid and the Pulpo...so soft and tasty... other cold tapas were as good as well and our dinner was very rewarding.The restaurant manager, Javi (please forgive me if it not correct) was there and checking if everything was good and the guests happy.Well done and nice restaurant where I would go back

I was not expecting this restaurant to be so good. I spent nearly 2 months in southern Spain last summer, and this restaurant took me right back there! The flavors, the seasoning, everything was completely authentic! Usually in a tapas restaurant, you'll find at least one thing you ordered that just wasn't as good as the others, but not here. Every single thing I would not hesitate to order again. The service was great as well, warm and welcoming. I'm very glad we wandered into this place

Business lunch in a casual setting...prompt service with excellent selection of tapas!Croquette was creamy and the squid was tender and well grilled. I thought the mushrooms were amazing! Prices were generally reasonable.A female friend of mine also could not stop ooggling at the manager.
