Nice buffet spread. The CHEF's service is SUPERB. Went for the buffet last week during the meat carver promotion, and oh my, the BEST char-siew, Kobe. wagyu and kurobuta i ever tasted. The warm pineapple with cinnamon crust was ABSOLUTELY DELIGHTFUL. Wonder if the FOOD is the same after the promotion
