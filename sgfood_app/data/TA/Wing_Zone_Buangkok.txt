Me and my wife have enjoyed numerous meals here, I would highly recommend you go with family or friends. The staff were super friendly which added to our experience!

Not too bad . Taste is good. Lots of different flavors to choose from . Had a take away dinner with my friends. Packaging helps to maintain heat and kept food fresh. Overall a good experience.

The restaurant is well located next to Buangkok MRT in the neighborhoods. Definitely a special treat for those staying nearby. I love spicy wings but it is rare to find in Singapore a place that sells wings that has a spice level to my liking. However, WINGZONE HAS IT!! It is a MUST TRY for people who loves spicy food! The wings were tasty and juicy on its own as well

Mostly average, but different flavours they offered on the menu were interesting! You can choose from over 15 fancy sauces to go with your burger or chicken wings. The outlet at Buangkok was rather empty on a weekday though, likely because the school holidays have ended. This outlet is based at a neighborhood location, so it stands out a little

It's was quite a novelty to try wings with a sweet sauce but nevertheless I had it. It didn't quite go well and you felt that you want to stop eating towards the last few wings.I would really like to try over sauces at another time.

There is something (flavors) for everyone. To be safe (less spicy), try their popular Honey Q. Move up one grade to Thai Chili, Tokyo Dragon or Smokin Q.No Msg and we love the succulent skins.We would recommend their wedges and brownies too.Value for money, and we would consider their takeaway for our next party
