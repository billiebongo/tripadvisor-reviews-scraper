The dessert lychee tiramisu is delicious.
The indoor area is too warm, and the air-con was dripping water because the door was kept opened.

Nice and cosy place. The set lunch menu is value for money. It is very popular during lunch hours so it might be good if there are more service staff during this period

The meal was very good and felt like it was prepared with lots of attention. Atmosphere was cosy with good wine.

Nice and relaxed restaurant in One North next to Fusionopolis One. It is next to the entrance of the carpark entrance. Good selection of finger food, and their wagyu beef burger is pretty good. Good ambience and service.

Ate a soup (ok), pizza (horrible) and pasta (also bad) and a dessert (meh)Lunch was $25. When we asked to split the bill, waiter was really hesitant (“normally we don’t split the bill, you pay now”)All in all, not the best place. Will not come again

We were here after a hard days work and the 3 course meal really energised us back.What we had was a seafood soup, Chicken main course and a orange tiramisu dessert .The taste for all the 3 items was excellent.Would go again, for sure recommended

When we feel like having quality pizza and tasty pasta, we always head out to Roots. Our second visit and again we opted for set lunch. At $21.80 ++, you get to choose either a pasta/pizza from the ala carte menu ($14.80 - $15.80), soup (today's options were tomato soup and rich creamy chowder) glass of soft drink and dessert (today's option was tiramisu).We had fukame seafood (shrimps, mussels and clams) pasta and Hawaii pizza which were very good. My bowl of chowder was indeed rich and creamy. We ended our meal with an irresistible tiramisu which has generous amount of custard

Tucked behind the mrt exit , front of galaxis main entrance...left side if standing in front of building. It is behind the mrt entrance exit you find roots. Busy on weekdays but fairly quiet weekends cos no office folks. Infact, just besides is insead and the hostel or loft. It is open on saturday but close sunday. If you are planning a get together or a romantic saturday but evetywhere is overcrowded, take the mrt and heads to roots at one north, it wil be a world of your own. It has outdoor seating and indoor. They have installed huge fans outside so it is still cool if u want the outdoor party feel. U can bring your pets too. It should be a great place for pets to mingle but be responsible no poo anywhere...hee. i bring my doggy and he loves to run about the open space , sniff the flowers and plants while we dine away. Love the beef pizza with cheese....yummy always, my truffle filled homemade omushroom soup, my dessert and my wine. Sometimes we go for the lamb chop , tomahawk, pasta, etc...just many choices of quality cuisine. Check out the menu and you may have your favorite. Of course in singapore you are spoilt for chouce but for a quiet afternoon or evening away from crazy crowd on a saturday, we love the quiet ambience. No shops about just you, family, loved ones or friends or pets get together for a great meal undisturbed. Remember switch off pokemon. Family times are hard to come by. Once lost, its gone! Enjoy. Good place for dates as well. She is not distracted by shops. Hah

Hidden alone in the Galaxis Work Loft in One North, finally enjoyed a meal and will be back. The bacon scallop starter was very good. Crunchy on the outside, soft tasty scallop on the inside. The Fukame spaghetti is a fusion of Japanese furikake, seafood and Ispaghetti. Truly enjoyable.Finally the extra small Tomahawk steak fed 3 adults with meat balanced by fresh vegetables. All in all a great meat to start the weekend
