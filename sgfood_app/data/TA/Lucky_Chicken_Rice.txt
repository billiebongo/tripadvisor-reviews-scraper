Excellent taste of hainan chicken rice, good taste, and good value for money. they only serve chicken rice. So they are really focused. If you are a chicken rice lover. This is a must visit place.

I have been patronizing this outlet in Lucky Plaza since 1997. It's great comfort food and amongst my favorite chicken rice outlets in Singapore. The other being Tien Tien at Maxwell Road Market & the other Hainanese Delicacy in Far East Plaza on the 5th floor, at Scotts Road. Cheap & Good !!One of Singapore's National Dishes.

I love their chicken rice. The broth is so tasty and the chicken is very tender. You can choose either the breast or the thigh part (I prefer the thigh because it's even more tender). The price is very reasonable too.I wasn't able to eat in the restaurant because I was in a wheelchair, and there were so many people I would end up bothering. I also prefer a quieter, more relaxing atmosphere. So I just bought the chicken and ate it in our hotel room. Wonderful comfort food

It's not a stall but it does serve, the best, bang for the buck, chicken rice in the Orchard Road area.I grew up with the Chatterbox chicken rice as my favorite stop in Singapore. This was in the late 70's, but these days, I can't justify the price of it. At Lucky Plaza I can get a double portion of chicken and an order of beansprouts with cuttlefish plus a bottle of water for S$15. Half the price of a single portion at Chatterbox. It's just as good. Chicken is cooked perfectly and service is quick. Downside is going there at peak hours means you'll have to wait for a table or share a table with other people.
5
Free refill of soup, fast service by elderly waitresses.
Strongly recommend to any tourist who are in or nearby Orchard.

Best hidden chicken rice stall in Lucky Plaza Orchard. Tasty and satisfying. And more to the surprise that the price is above expectation. Cheap!
5
The Location is a bit hidden and the pLace is not fancy whatsoever, but the chicken rice was weLL worth it. The best meaL I've had in the trip.
5
I'm fairly sure these people have made chicken rice before - one of the best versions we've ever had (and we've eaten a lot)!
When in Singapore, eat here.

On this trip to Singapore I made it my quest to find the best Chicken Rice in Singapore Island. Alas my trip did not allow me to completely explore everyone's claim of having the "best chicken rice in Singapore", but I certainly tried!I did get this recommendation from a local I happen to be speaking with randomly on one of my explorations. She said this would be the best in the Orchard road area which is the mega shopping street, similar to Oxford circus in London and 5th Avenue in NYC.Anyway it takes a bit of hunting to find this hole in the wall but I got some very good directions. Enter through the front entrance of Lucky Plaza ( facing Orchard Rd.) veer left and you will see a set of escalators going up to LEVEL 2. Once you get up there you turn left and you're faced with a set of stores, veer right and you will see a restaurant called "Rabbit" turn right and walk toward the end of the stores. You will be able to smell the delicious aroma of the cooked rice, just follow your nose and the crowds. This is a lunch time favourite, so go there around 1pm to get a seat faster.Someone will seat you and just order from the written menu by the kitchen. Enjoy and enjoy... Burp

3 of us ordered half chicken + 3 rice. Half chicken cost $25. Not exactly coffeeshop price, but given the fact that it's in touristy Orchard and the generous portion of chicken and cucumber soaked in sweet soya sauce, I would say it's value for money. The elderly staff were friendly too! Your customary bowl of chicken soup is refilled periodically ala bak kut teh style.My picky 7-year-old needed no prompting to polish off the entire adult portion plate of rice.The soya bean drink was a tad too sweet.. skip if you don't have a sweet tooth

Located inside old plaza, the shop was small and descent. As that evening we intended to have chicken rice before we left Singapore, we just tried our luck by getting into this shop. Payment had to be done once the food was served, and we felt a bit ackward though. Still, once we tasted the food.....wow....I had to say that the chicken rice exceeded our expectation. It was much better than our favorite chicken rice we used to have, when we are in Singapore. Certainly, with that price they set....I surely have no regret to substitute my favorite one with theirs.....

Its tucked in the corner of Lucky Plaza, but one of my all time favourites for Chicken Rice. The line isn't that long, as they are always moving people in and out as fast as possible, and their chicken is fragrant and rice is nice and flavourful. Chilli and Black soy sauce added to the rice complete the combination
4
people in singapore said lucky chicken rice is the famous chicken rice in singapore, but for me it's the same as other Hainam rice in singapore, lucky chicken rice is very crowded at lunch, the price is not too expensive
4

I never miss an opportunity to eat at this place everytime I visit Singapore. Their chicken rice is the best in Orchard area although I cannot say the same for their service (the same as all service in Singapore, no smile)
4
There are two chicken rice shops in Lucky Plaza but this is the most crowded during lunch. Taste is nice, portion is satisfying, and value for money.
If I'm waiting for hospital results @Mount Elizabeth, I'll be at Lucky Plaza for lunch.
5
Easily the best tasting chicken rice in the area
Worth it to walk over to Lucky Plaza for this meal
All the food courts in Ion, Ngee Ann/Taka etc have a chicken rice stall but none are as good as Lucky

I was there for a quick lunch today as I was running a bit late for my flight back home. My wife ordered 1 steam chicken and 1 roasted chicken drumstick. The orders came out within 1 minute ++. The rice tasted quite good. The chicken was just average but I got no complaints as I was a bit hungry and glad the food came out fast. Overall, not too bad a place to have lunch nearby Mt E. Maybe I'll go back again

Oh yes yess the chicken rice in lucky plaza is really good. The food court is quite crowded so better come early. The price for the chicken rice is pretty standard around singapore. Of course its 10 times cheaper as compared to chatter box! Im really satisfied with the chicken rice
