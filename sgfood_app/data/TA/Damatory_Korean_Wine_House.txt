Had after dinner drinks with friends. Enjoyed their soju and decided to ordered some snacks. The food is great as well especially their kimchi pancake. Their servers are very friendly.

Nice food with friendly staff at a reasonable price. First time ever eating Korean had a great time trying a new thing. Had a free started surprisingly, to go with a nice meal.

Apparently this place has been around for many years, but no reviews? strangeFriends brought me here, and we opted for the a la buffet dinner. At $39 per person, or $29 before 7pm, this is a fantastic dealWe ordered the pancakes, chicken wings, kimchi soup, spicy squid, mussel soup and they were all good and served in generous portions. The pork belly was a standout in taste and extra generous portion as well. and for $29 per person, what a stealService is slightly erratic and some servers don't even really understand english, but what the heck. Add a few more bottles of shoju, and all is forgive
