This is probably the most authentic Hainanese Chicken rice I've ever tasted. Being a Hainanese myself, I missed my Grandma's home cooked chicken rice. I tot I would never be able to taste it again... until I discovered this stall. Expect queues, long queues, esp old folks and regulars who know how real Hainanese Chicken Rice taste like, not the Food Court one. â˜º

This is in a food court of small shopping complex. Completely local. S$2.50 for a plate of chicken and rice. This was my first meal in Singapore. There was a long line that moved quickly. You can't beat it for the price. You must use the chili sauce or it will be BLAND. With chili sauce, it becomes amazing. Not spicy at all.

Yes, Hainanese Chicken Rice can be found everywhere in Singapore. However to find a place that offers such a tender chicken with fragrant rice along with the super low price. Heng Ji Chicken Rice is the very few places you could get with such a quality chicken. It's only $2.5, really. I'm not kidding. With this price you are still able to get a good thickness of the meat. Another kicker is, their chili sauce is quite unique as well. Don't miss it.Conclusion: I will go back again, again and again .... Chinatown Complex Market and Food Centre is the only few hawker centre left which you could find the most authentic and original Singapore local food. Why not
