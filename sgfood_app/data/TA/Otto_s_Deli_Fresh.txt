Nice honest food...delicuous. Second visit still impress. Cant get better for this prices. Lady boss is friend and service is good. Deco abit too sparse for my liking.

If wine and beer is not available, don't pout it on the menu out front. If dietary requirements aren't taken notice of, don't take them down at the table.
A bit pricey for what it is, especially soft drinks. Food was edible but nothing special.

We've been here a few times. It's never failed. Food is always well-prepared and tasty. There's a good selection to choose from so everyone in the family gets to eat his/her preferred choice. The ambience is pleasant too.

. One look at the menu and it seemed a bit pricey for a small cafe tucked in corner .Later i searched the internet and Read reviews this cafe was the brainchild of Chef otto weibel . I ordered the smoked tomato soup and duck confit. Both were good! Tomato soup was so fresh and tasty i wished i could have unlimited servings! Duck was small but it was fried well on both sides. Duck costs sgd 24 and soup was sgd 9.50. Not the cheapest for casual looking cafe but worth a visit. Staff members were attentive

Chanced upon this restaurant while looking for a place to have lunch. The place was quite busy. So the food took some time to come. The food was good as was the dessert. The reason for a drop in the rating was that the asparagus that came with my wife's dish was rather fibrous; that is, 'old'.They have a good variety of creative drinks. So you could just come here for drinks & dessert; which I may soon do

We were the only 3 people in the restaurant and ordered three meals (1 for each of the 3 of us)- 2 from the menu and then eggs and bacon (2 items from another item on the menu). The cook could only manage 1 dish at a time so the first two dishes arrived one by one. These dishes were somewhat less than delightful. The staff were clearly overwhelmed by the arrival of two other guests because they forgot our third order. When we queried where our food was we were told that they thought we wanted it later. Will not be returnin

This restaurant is in a lovely location and nicely set out. But the food is very poor. I tried this twice now, the first time the wine was good and the service, but the burger was smothered in BBQ sauce which made it quite unpleasant.I went a second time, putting my food down to a poor choice by me, but this time I chose the Chicken Wrap, although I asked for no pickles, it came with pickles. It was also toasted, which is not mentioned on the menu (I have a dislike to toasted lettuce, which just makes it a soggy mess). Again the wrap was smothered in a tomato chutney. This is definatley not a "Deli" or "Fresh"

Another weekend family get-together dinner in once-cherished Holland Village!This trendy cafe offers not only fantastic Mediterranean deli like pasta and waffles etc., but also classy cuppa floral tea and coffee...in trendy setting.New guests could be assured of caring hospitality and charges are reasonable at SGD130+ for 05 adults and 02 kids

The place was next to the escalators, with not much customers. However one could spot a number of tables especially the sofa bench side with the reserved sign on.There was 2-course and 3-course lunch set but the mains did not interest me. So decided to have a la carte. Water was served.Truffle Mushroom Capellini ($18++)63 degree Celsius Egg, Eryngii Mushroom, Parmesan Crisp, Mushroom Cream, Black Truffle OilThe dish smelt quite nice of truffle when served. The pasta was well braised in a rich and thick sauce, with the poached egg making the sauce even more richer. The Parmesan Crisp was light and savoury, making one wishing for more.  Burnt Banana Waffle ($12++)Smoky grilled banana over buttermilk waffle, topped with peanut butter gelato and a freeze-dried bananaThe waffle was light and cripy although I would prefer it to be less dense and more airy. The peanut butter gelato was creamy without too sweet, while the banana was so soft and sweet. Service was not bad with the staffs being quite friendly and making recommendations

I must commend Otto's for its warm and friendly staff and yummy food. As I was on a vegetarian diet, I had enquired if I could have the ham and cheese sandwich without the ham as part of their weekend brunch special. The friendly staff not only took the extra effort to check in with their chef and re proposed a cheese sandwich with a vegetable ratatouille filling. Honestly, it was the best sandwich I have had in awhile. Over and above that, the friendly disposition of the staff and commitment to customer service comes through strongly. I also paid a very reasonable $19 for a main, waffle and coffee. Would strongly recommend this Cafe.

This is an excellent restaurant. It serves excellent food, as good as in any fancy Italian restaurant, but without the pretentious and expensive setting. Service is friendly. Prices are very reasonable - on the cheap side for food of this quality. Highly recommended.

Nice staff, nice food but service is a tad slow unfortunately! They forgot my coffee and it took A while to get it after telling them.

Had the beef stroganoff fettuccine! Wonderful.. The beef was so tender and delicious. Pasta was cooked Al dente. My wife just loves the food here!

i would come back to this cafe, if only to sit by the window and look at the clouds while mooning over how extremely delicious the cakes and waffles are. a must try is the burnt banana waffles with ice cream and tea/coffee. we came at tea time and they had the 1 for 1 cakes - must try those as well. it's ridiculous how one can just spend hours here. service staff was friendly and made good recommendation on the cakes. there are like at least 8 types. they also serve food - that would be for another time. location is just next to the holland village mrt station

My friend and I came after our music rehearsal, planning to have a coffee and catch up before we both left for our respective dinner appointments. This place was pretty good for that. Nice ambience and the food was decent, although service wasn't exactly quick (so you might not enjoy this place as much if you are in a hurry). The waffle comes with a free hot drink! Can't comment on their brunch style food as I only had the waffle, but I wouldn't mind coming back again if I'm in the area.

At 3 pm one wonders to have brunch or tea. I decided to have a bit of both. Ordered the signature dish Norwegian Salmon capellini with coffee. You get a free dessert of the day with the main. Everything looks so good you want to pack all in...... the burgers, waffles, fries and the cakes. Next time

I walked past this cafe several times before but never tried. Their lunch special is always chicken which isn't my fave. And there's only 1 choice. I was hungry today and tired to look for other options so I just settled on this. The male waiter was really friendly and nice. His service was very attentive. The soup was ok. I liked the roasted flavor of the cauliflower. Rather large portion too. The main meal was alright. The chicken tasted gamey to me. Maybe it needed more herbs or something. The sautÃ©ed veg and garlic mash potatoes were nice though. The set with a drink (I chose blue lemonade) was quite nice actually at $17.50++ after tax $20.60. The cafe was freezing though as there was hardly any guests. 3 tables only. I actually quite enjoyed my food and thought of having some cake & coffee (but it was freezing and I decided to go warm up) or come back another time if I'm in the area and hungry. But the payment at the cashier really pushed me to give this joint a rating from my initial average to Poor. Most joints would put up BIG signs outside the store or at the cashier , cash only or credit card payments above $Xx. But I didn't see any when I entered the shop. I was cold so I went to the counter to pay and there wasn't any staff around then to wave for the bill anyway as they were busy. As usual as per habit, I just handed over my credit card. She said Credit Card only above $30. First shocker. A seemingly uppity place with prices that aren't cheap actually don't accept credit cards for all payments?I just casually said but it's not stated?She pointed to the small print line of paper which was stuck to the inside of the bill sleeve and said its written here with a grouchy face. Like duh!? You can't read. To make matters worse, she pointed somewhere and said also there... It's stated no credit card payment below $30. As if I was the dumbest blind person she ever seen. It's fine for establishments to want cash payment but it's necessary to have Big Prominent signs. What happens if customers don't have cash? Now everywhere is advocating cashless. Even credit cards used for MRT $0.80 fee, so?! I'm very displeased about her rudeness and I did tell her that her attitude is quite rude. I was very ok with the male staff and friendly too. But she the cashier acted as if the customer is brainless. Later on, knowing my displeasure, she said in a cheery tone upon giving me my change, have a nice day come back again. I really doubt so. 1) I'm actually a person who prefers cashless transactions. Even macdonald and crystal jade allow credit card transaction for even $5-10. 2) average food3) rude cashier 4) hey, this is holland village! So much food to choose from!! Better service better prices... I'm not impressed. And judging from other comments posted here, bad service seems to be the norm.

Service was poor and slow. was it because my husband was wearing shorts and slippers? I don't know. I made my order for the iced chocolate (aka iced milo dinosaur 75% ice which you can finish with 3 sips) and the lady asked rudely "is that all?" When my husband was still pouring through the menu. Definitely not value for money and yes decent food but not at this price. The waffles serving was half a waffle, we had a good laugh over it. not coming back here ever again and I highly do not recommend

Otto Deli Fresh is in a new building at Holland Village. The theme is modern casual all-day dining and the menu is well thought through. My Pulled Pork bun was delicious and my wife's Barramundi was also a winner. Service was fast and friendly and pricing not too bad for Singapore

Came on a Sunday at lunch time. Place was only half full, and it's a small restaurant.Ambience was pleasant and service was polite. Some hits and misses with the food we ordered.1. Octopus Salad - Not worth the $17. A small mound of salad, with a dull dressing, and around 6 pieces of octopus, which although, sweet, was  tough, chewy and over-charred.2. Eggs benedict - Alright but nothing spectacular. In fact the poached eggs were  almost too runny, like soft boiled. 3. Hangar steak - Steak was tender and had a nice flavour, accompanying fries  were over-salted.4. Wagyu beef rump - Tender and beefy, but came medium instead of medium-rare, as ordered. Again, fries and the steak were way too salty.5. Pressed Beef Steak Ciabatta - Rather good. Thin, crisp panini, good filling of beef, arugula and carmelised onions. 6. Beef Stroganoff Fettuccine - Dish had alot of promise, at first bite. Al dente pasta,  tender beef, savoury creamy sauce. However, it was overly-salted and I could only eat half. 7. Cake + Coffee promo - Cup of flat white, which was good, and a huge slice of  Peanut butter chocolate cake, which looked so good,  but flavour was so blah. Chocolate sponge was bland,  buttercream filling also bland. If I was blindfolded, I  would not have known what I was eating. 8. Creme Brulee - Good but ordinary.9. Burnt banana waffle - Waffle was light and crispy but that was it. Hardly any  taste to it. Accompanying gelato was not bad, but the  freeze-dried bits of banana was awful. Hard, rubbery and  inedible. Overall, I would come here again, but I would tell them to go easy on the salt; and for dessert, I'd adjourn to Sunday Folk, 2 minutes walk away, for killer waffles
