I went to this area for work, and was searching just food court. I found this place, tried Fried hongkong noodle. I think it is good for foreign people. The employees recommended this food.

A nice comfortable vegetarian restaurant with good choices of rice, noodles , soup and starters. Prices are reasonable and commensurate with the quality of food. Staff are very pleasant and help you with some suggestions to try newer varieties. Have already been there thrice and enjoyed food

This place has to be the finest Chinese vegetarian restaurant in Singapore. Run by a couple, we've been visiting this place at least once a week for last 8 years. We discovered this while we lived in Hougang and having moved to Sengkang several years ago, we still love going back to this place for a quick dinner. Dumplings here are wonderful. We've never enjoyed dumplings elsewhere as much as we did here. The veggies like kailan, mixed vegetables, sambal kang kong, etc all are good. The Ee Mee, Fried Noodles, Black Pepper La Mian, olive fried rice, veggie fried rice, Tom yam noodles, etc all of them are awesome. Must visit
