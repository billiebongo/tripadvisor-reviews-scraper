Hidden treasure at Chai Chee. Don’t be deceived by the location. What’s matter are the quality of food & the wonderful service by Chef Fabio & Team

One of the good Japanese restaurant around Viva industrial park, Chai Chee.
Quiet a wide selections of Japanese dishes and Japanese beers and whiskeys.
Prices are affordable, mid range.
One of our fav restaurant in this area.

Japanese food recommended here. After a long shopping in Decathlon, I came across this restaurant. Food are incredibly nice.

A friend suggested Omakase at Yoda. I was skeptical esp when we entered the restaurant as the decor was not that of an authentic Japanese restaurant but the whole dinner turned out to be such a pleasant surprise. The chef , Fabio, was friendly and very meticulous with the presentation of each platter. Every item was such a delight and the cold sake he recommended went well with our sumptuous meal. For sure, we will be back !

It is right next to Decathlon so we expected the place to be crowded for lunch at noon but to our surprise there were only 3-4 tables seated in a fairly spacious setting.The biggest let down is the poor quality of the rice that is critical to sushi. The sauce is also very salty. The fish is relatively fresh. Price wise it is not expensive but not that cheap either given the quality. I think Wahiro is a better choice
