Very good quality, customer service and setting. We tried several sushi bars in Singapore and we found this one was the best of all!

chirashi is always the fav talk of the town. love the service, very polite and humble team of servers. create small talk is the culture of sitting at the counter seat. Ah Foo make us feel very at home while eating and knowing more about the food. Enjoy my short lunch break while knowing more about the food and getting to know there is another branch in Pickering! Will go and explore Singapore need more personalised chef and service to make food service into a food heavenly paradis

Had a light dinner here and ordered their set B sushi with amazake. The amazake had an unusual taste to it, good, but not say great. It's thick and pretty sweet. Worth a try if you've never had amazake before. You'll only get half a cup though.The sushi is good too. I like the fact that they prepare the sushi with the wasabi inside, as it should be. Not so sure abt brushing the fish with soy sauce since they they don't change the brush or soy sauce jar for different customers, and you are brushing raw fish with it. Nevertheless, the experience was interesting. Ratio of fish to meat is spot on. Prawn and amberjack could be slightly more fresh. But then again I came late on a Friday night so maybe that's why. The eel, tuna and salmon roe are perfect
