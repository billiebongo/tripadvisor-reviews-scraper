A beautiful cool sanctuary amidst a hot, not so clean area. Breastfeeding welcome sign on the door - something that should be welcome everywhere but sadly isn't. The toilets were dirty which was disappointing when the shop was sparkling clean in contrast. Juices were delicious!

Coffee is very nice, a bit pricey but good, food is ok, the staff at the Lexington store is super rude and always in a bad mood!!! Gosh cheer up! My 4.50 dollars cappuccino doesn't taste that good now

Enjoyed the food and drinks. Service was good. Loved the meatballs. Food portion was huge. Ambience at the place was great! We had a good experience!
3
The place was rather empty when we arrived. Ordered the food and it was served within 20mins. The food and service were okay. Nothing much to pick on. Good for gathering.

Fantastic. Just a little sad Fika Millenia Walk outlet will close at the end of the year. Celebrated 3 of my wife's birthday there :(

Good location. Nice place. Delicious food. Patient waiter. Just the next place with big group was too noisy.

This place is good for gathering cos its not crowded even on a Sunday evening. Food portion was big with reasonable price. Would visit again!

I'd give it a 3.5 stars.This wasn't the original place I intended on coming for dessert / coffee as the place I was supposed to go didn't have what I thought they had from website.So I stumbled on this cafe as it was right next door and decided to give it a shot. There's both outdoor & indoor dining options. Inside only has 8 tables. The place was busy and took the last table inside.I looked at their Winter menu online before entering and knew what I wanted until, once again, twice in a row didn't have the dessert available. So opted for Red Velvet which was ok, it was moist. I can make a better cake. I ordered mocha latte and on first sip it was barely lukewarm...remake was better temp.Guests around me food looked decent and good portion sizes.Prices are typical Singapore prices for a restaurant.50-50 if I'd return...may try it one more time for a meal

We had some Swedish Meatballs in the restaurant for lunch. The service is slow and not very friendly. Also the quality of the food is poor for the price. You can get better meatballs at IKEA for only a small percentage of the price. Even a simple coke is for Singaporean prices expensive. The only pro is that you can sit outside to have you lunch - what I really like. But beside this I would not recommend this restaurant

A group of us met up before going our separate ways for the holidays. A friend and I have been to the outlet near Arab Street, but this was my first time at Millenia Walk. The service is friendlier and the space is less crowded at Millenia Walk. I'm not a fan of the utilitarian furniture, but the place is light and spacious, the staff were friendly, the beverage selection (particularly teas and mocktails) is lovely, and the Princess Cake is amazing--it really seemed like a confectionary treat from Europe (marzipan, cream, jam, sponge cake). I went back the next day for another slice.

we ordered grilled chicken and the swedish meatballs. also ordered a side of potato wedges with cheese. food were good. if they would serve iced tap water that would be good- they sell bottled water only.
5
Truly satisfied with Fika's service and the food too was simply scrumptious. Definitely going back there again!

Great place to gather with friends, great ambience, great food with awesome desserts and friendly staff!

We ordered 3 steaks, all medium well. I was totally disappointed as mine appeared overly well done! The other 2 steaks were so much more tender and mine was so tough!

Great food, friendly staff who provide good service, great place to hange out for all ages and good location.

Introduced my family to Swedish food. The portions are adequate enough and the food does taste unique compared to other cultures. The prices are a bit on the high side though - go when you have a discount.
3
The experience was fine, probably service a little slow. The food was average. It's nice if you want a halal place to chit chat with friends and have dinner at the same time.

Restaurant is a stone throw away from the bustling Suntec City. Compared to Suntec City, dining in Millenia Walk is a pleasant experience as it is less crowded yet conveniently located. The restaurant's setting is a reflection of its Scandinavian roots, minimalistic and earthy. The staff was polite and their service meets the conventional expectations. The food that I ordered was delectable and presentable. The portion size was also reasonable. In terms of value, the standard cafe's pricing. Overall, I am very satisfied with the place. Not forgetting that the place is halal-certified, I will definitely visit the place again if I am sharing a meal with Muslim friends

Great place for brunch, we enjoyed the 50% discounts from Eatigo, and had such a sumptuous meal! Fika Breakfast was very well prepared, love the mix combination of food, Mushroom crepe is great, must try if you are at the restaurant, personally I quite like the Beef Steak, very well prepared, I had mine at Medium Well, steak was juicy, meat firm, Super nice! I loved it! (Maybe need to give more sauce, and nicer if it's black pepper sauce!)We also had a pasta called Fisherman's Pasta, Friend says it's quite good, portion is quite generous! Waiter has always been quite charming with a great attitude while we were there! :)Great deal to go with Eatigo!

Heard so much about this swedish restaurant so decided to give it a try. Nice ambience and spacious. Staff were friendly and informed us of the waiting time for our order. We enjoyed the:1. Meatballs- Quite filling if you are a small eater. They served 8 meatballs in a plate. Meatballs were tender and the sauce is nice.2. Baked potato with skagen - It has freshwater shrimps in it. Yummy!3. Apple crumble pie. Also Yummy! Love it.The Iced Apple Tea was a bit too sour for our liking. The Fika Salad is very fresh and Pancakes were very soft, however we do find them a little bit pricey. It does get a bit busy during lunch hour so be prepared to wait.

Loved the salad and location was nice- not very fancy- just good, unpretentious, friendly. Good for a quick lunch/dinner...
3
Nice restaurant. Ambience and staff service was good. Overpriced food. Meatballs were extremely salty though.
5
Based on my first experience..... I cannot forget the delights of Swedish taste...
Now.... every time I visit Singapore, I always take time to enjoy this nice recipe ....

This is a pretty awesome cafe serving a lot of firing variety of coffee, called and snacks. The ambient is very lighted and the space feels very airy and specious.

Reservation was made, however when we reached, there was no table available. Staff have to create one on the stop. Only 2 staff was seen. It was a Friday evening, should have more staff on the ground. Did was not bad just kind of too oily for me. Hot chocolate was fantastic, love it!

I went with 8 friends for a get-together. We chose this place as it was halal, which nicely suited some members of our group. The main thing I have to say is how haphazardly things were organised in this branch. Mains came before appetisers, two orders were forgotten, cutlery was not automatically given and we had to ask for plates for our appetisers. Even then they did not provide enough for everyone. I sense the servers were harassed & there was a large group before us which occupied almost the whole restaurant. Perhaps this threw them off.In fairness I found the servers to be sincere and apologetic when things were slow or forgotten. They offered a free soup to the two friends whose mains were forgotten. My garlic pasta with meatballs was dry and cried out for some sort of sauce. The food was average at best. Personally I would not come by but on the whole I believed my friends were happy.
4
A perfect place for a vegetarian with many options to have a good meal. The staff is quick and the restaurant has option of both indoor and outdoor sitting. The pasta was awesome with perfect basil taste and a variety of shakes makes it even better. A good place to hang out

Came here to try their signature meatball dishes. The service was decent, the restaurant interior was nice and clean. We ordered the meatballs and the meat patty with mash. Make sure you add some salt to the patato dishes as it was a little bland for us. We had the velvet cake, not as fluffy but very creamy. Overall it was an average experience. Nothing bad but nothing great either.

We had steak before at the One Km outlet and it was done nicely. But this time around I was very disappointed. My daughter and I ordered 2 medium well steaks. Mine turned out more like well done. While my daughter's had blood still dripping off the middle part. Had a hard time chewing and even cutting the meat! I asked the waiter about it and he promptly took it away. Gave me a soup to compensate nd promised a new one in 5 to 10 minutes time. It was more than 15 minutes. By then I lost interest in eating. My kids and wife took over, still leaving a few cuts left over. Clearly spoiled mg meal. Such a mistake is clearly unexpected. Luckily the others had no problems with their dishes

We've been here a couple of times and the food is always good. Favourite dishes are the meatballs and pyt i panna. The cream sauce and lingonberry jam complement the meatballs very well. The beets in the pyt i panna are refreshing in this hearty dish. Portions are good. Prompt service too. Will keep coming back here. :
