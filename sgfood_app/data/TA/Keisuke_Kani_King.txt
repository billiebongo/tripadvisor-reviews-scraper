I actually prefer the lobster broth at the Keisuke in Clarke Quay over this crab broth, but the rad atmosphere trumps broth differential.Godzilla, Ultraman and all your favourites are here, so you don't just have to talk about the broth and take photos of the broth.Broth

Weâ€™re at Cineleisure for a movie and decided to have lunch at this Ramen restaurant. Ordered the Crab broth ramen with rich soup base. Taste good with the noodle texture cooked at the right level I like. A good place for Ramen if you are looking for something difference from traditional pork soup base ramen

Visited few time and if I can recall correctly, my first try of Keisuke Ramen at their first outlet at Millenia Walk also Crab Broth Ramen. Can't recall if that is the thick version but for the Kani restaurant, I always had the thick broth as I am thinking that might taste richer. I chose all-in and I got all toppings. Tried the omelet ramen too but I prefer the usual one. It comes with free flow of eggs and 2 pickles. Nice place for Crab Ramen

I Wanted to eat here with my mom but it was so packed and the line was a bit long so decided to pass. Ended up coming back the following day for early lunch at 11am. Was the first one in the shop. tâ€™s the first time Iâ€™ve tried crab broth ramen and the taste is amazing but may have a strong taste which may not appeal to everyone. I had the basic rich crab broth ramen with everything on it egg and pork. Had some free helpings of their egg and cabbage. I finished the entire bowl! Will certainly be coming back.

first time trying this, and we were very impressed. the shop front was pretty unassuming, not expecting much for a quick dinner before movie in this little joint. when the ramen arrived, the broth was so flavorful, rich, and tasty, probably comparable to a lobster bisque starter soup in a restaurant. noodles and ingredients were fresh and consistent as well, will definitely come back again

Just not to my taste yet... I ordered the Kani Ramen, honestly... I can't really taste crab broth.. not sure why. I just think it doesn't go well with chasiu. There was a long queue for lunch. As always, the side dishes like egg, bean sprout and cabbage are free flo

According to my Asian colleagues very famous for its crab-soup and I have to say the meal was amazing! Very tasty and a good size portion! Lots of variations available. The interior is quite small but very well designed! Excellent for a quick business lunch! I will be back

Love the feel and decor of this place. Really a little like stepping into another world when you enter from outside. Their signature dish is wonderful. Different from the usual ramen, and very much like bisque in taste. And oh, the green tea cola is a must. Tastes more of cola than green tea, and is actually quite a refreshing drink
