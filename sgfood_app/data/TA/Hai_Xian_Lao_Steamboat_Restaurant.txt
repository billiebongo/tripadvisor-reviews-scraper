First my brother bring my whole family we like it so much after I intro my friend's all also said is streamboat buffet and we organise a big group of 20 friends to enjoy a early cny dinner.
2
It was a birthday dinner, however we did not enjoy having dinner there as we were all disappointed in certain areas..
5
The restaurant wasnt crowded and the servers paid full attentions to us. Food was of good quality.
Overall experience was very positive.
4
The beef and pork were good, but not the yong tau foo and various other items were average. The service however, was impeccable.
3
Overall not bad for buffet hopot dinner but unfortunately until the end of my dinner, some orders were not fulfilled.
4
Given that I made the reservations more than a month prior, the restaurant surprised me with a bad seat! A round table just beside the sauce counter where the traffic is rather high and the corridors were rather narrow. I wished that they could provide me with better seats. Food wise not bad and service is above average! Just that the laksa broth was abit salty... but overall not too bad for my first time there

Went there to celebrate my mum's birthday. We had a group of 6 adults & 1 child and were seated rather comfortably at their table, with additional 2 chairs provided. There will be limited space on the table, due to the food that we will be ordering - so good thing that the back of the chairs had landings that we could put things like our cups of water.We went for the buffet and it was good. The fried food were all freshly cooked and hence when it arrived at our table, they were still hot & crispy. Very unlike other places where all these are pre-cooked and hence cold & at times even soggy when we eat them.The service was also impeccable. We had a staff that came from Vietnam serving us and she was very willing to help cook some of the food and was always nearby to take our additional orders. They even helped us to de-shell the prawns before we cook them - so it was very easy to eat them.The staff never had any 'black' face when we kept asking for things and was cheerfully serving us throughout the time. And we were not the only table that she had to take care ofEveryone in our party had an extremely satisfying meal. I would definitely want to return again to this place

Hai Xian Lao is very popular with Thai and Chinese diners. Good selection of soup base including Tom Yum, Mala, Laksa, Herbal Chicken and etc... .We took the buffet menu which comes with unlimited serving of appetizers and raw food items. In general, the experience was good but the restaurant can be a tad warm when it gets crowded. Suggest to avoid peak hours as servers may forget certain orders
2
our first visit to HXL and wanted to try their steamboat since it has been raining endlessly. the other 2 tables that arrived after us received their orders before us and everytime we ask for our missing food or on the delay, their reply is always the system/printer got problem so didn't receive our orders. Why is everyone else receiving their food then? Portion size per pax is pathetic as well. Not worth
3
Made the booking an hour prior. However, service staff missed out the sms notification sent to them by Chope and did not have a table ready for us. I left my number with him when he promised to call once there is table. However, tables were taken by new comers when I came back after 15 mins. This made my Chope booking redundant
5
Price Better than Hai Di Lao like buffet and drinks are free flow visit 3rd time friend also like the place also help to book 2nd time.
3
Food is slow to come, ordered items also didn't come as complete. Took long time to finish the food as food came slow. Soup collagen n mala was good.
4
A good place to chill with friend, price wise is reasonable about $30 per pax for ala carte. Buffet is about $34+++.
4
The place is spacious and is ideal for groups and the staff are very attentive to our requests. Would definitley come back for groups gathering!
5
Service was great by the staff in Hai Xian Lao, refilling our drinks automatically when our drinks were almost finished, as well as changing our plates when it is full of prawn shell.
4
Was looking for alternative other than mainstream hai di lao & wasn't disappointed. It was pretty pricey for 2 at about $90 including taxes considering the limitation of meat dishes but definitely enjoyed the quietness when we arrive before 5pm.
5
Awesome service. The staff were all so friendly & attentive, plus the food are all fairly priced. Not like those over-rated hotpots imoo
4
Went for ala-carte thinking we will not accede buffet price.As there were some choices in buffet where we could only go for once.in the end our bill was the same price as buffet, but at least we get to eat what we want.Overall wasn't a bad experience thou. As compared to the service @ HDL and beauty in the pot, the service here is not up to standard.
4
We had buffet lunch and came in 30 mins before opening time. The friendly staff saw us and invited us to sit down. She swiftly brought the menu for us to have look while she continue to prepare the sauces. Seeing us around, they quickly prep the soup base. Wide varieties of ingredients and esp the finger foods are very nice! Praise the staff as they keep topping up soup and water for us
4
We were dropped near this restaurant by and Uber guy, as all of the central places had closed. We spotted this place and thought that it looked nice. The menu was limited as we arrived very late in the night, but we thought 'never mind, let's order a mixture and eat what is nice'! it was all very nice and tasty. I would definitely go back there for a meal and would like to try the larger daytime menu
5
First visit to the restaurant and am impressed with the food, and service provided too! Value for money.
4
True to its name, their seafood was fresh and the fish paste (limited to 1 order per person for buffet) was surprisingly good! Their service was tip-top as well with polite waitressing staff
3
Service quite bad.. Not much people but need to wait quite Long. And order not accurate. Provide wrong information too
4
Location was pretty convenient and as the mall itself wasn't too noisy, it allowed us (friends) to chat freely. Service was quite fast and the staff were friendly. The choice of ingredients was relatively sufficient and I personally liked the chicken soup.
5
We really had a great family dinner there. Recommend for parties and gatherings. It is suitable for people of all ages
2
We have yet to finish our food and the staff actually off-ed our steamboat without even asking us. It would be good if they have the courtesy to ask if we are still eating.
3
Very strict about Child policy. They insist my child of 4yo must pay. We end up taking ala carte. Food is ok but no wow factor. Average price per adult about $50 per pax.
4
Food quality is good. Price is little on a high side for buffet dinner with prawns only 1 serving. :( Will go again though.
4
Environment is cosy and their background music are awesome! The staffs are very service oriented ,very approachable
5
Had the buffet. Food was great. Service staff made a conscious effort to serve with a smile and made sure our table was clean. Recommended.
3
Meats too thinly sliced...can't taste at all ...if order buffet the drinks is free flow but the spread is limited ..we ordered ala carte we have to pay for 2nd drink ...not generous
4
i've been here a few times.
food is good but the tomato soup was too bland this time round.
service is great, and staff was friendly too.
3
Soup base quite good but quality of the food some are either okay or below average which we unable to force ourselves to finish it, especially those fish related dishes are terribly fishy.
Price wise ok. But i wont patronise it again.
4
A very pleasant restaurant to enjoy steamboat buffet dinner.
Good spread of seafood and healthy vegetables.
Excellent choice of Chilli sauces to go with the delicious food and meat.
Highly recommend.
4
The cheaper alternative compared to HDL. Offers buffet options which makes it more worth it. Prompt service always.
4
Nice clean atmosphere. Ideal for families. Not hot and stuffy like others. Food is alsoooo fresh. Would return
3
The steamboat buffet is priced at around $35++. Soup base variety is relatively good since there seems like have 4 options
4
Food and service was good. We got complimentary lobster, birthday noodle and birthday cake during our visit.
4
Ample space for big group (we had 8 of us). The great thing for this place is they are opened till 530am hence you can have hotpot till wee morning. The service is prompt and they will change your plates without being prompt. Will visit again :
4
Good variety of ingredients available for the steamboat. Various soup bases to try, which I give the collagen soup base an absolute thumbs-up. Good service by the attentive servers (probably it will as because I was there during the non-peak period), especially by this Shandong lad 'Wen Jian'. Buffet option is available, and get free flow of drinks with an additional topup. Try their chicken wings - I only wanted to have one, but it was so delicious, I couldn't stop myself from having a second helping! Indoor and outdoor seating is available
2
servers was not attentive as we were sitting outside. hard to get their attention. waved many times to get their attention
3
Decent spread with above average prices. Given its location, you would be entitled to expect better.
4
worth it if dine before 10pm coz adult buffet $34.9++, with free flow drinks. Both indoor and outdoor environment are very friendly
3
Atmosphere and seat is comfortable, food is fresh, staff is friendly but service is slow. Staff seem controlling the food ordered when attempt to place the second round order ^_^
4
The food is very fresh and the service is good as the staffs will keep asking you for any top up of drinks as we had order the free flow drinks.
4
I visited this Hai Xian Lao Steamboat Restaurant for several times and every time this restaurant never disappoint me. Staff is helpful and attend to you promptly. Food preparation are efficient. For those none steam boat food, they just taste marvelous.
4
Overall good, customer services good. Variety of soups base. Provide buffet at affordable prices. Will come back again.
1
Do not recommend! Don't even bother!
Waited for 30 mins the bloody soup still haven't heat up!!! Buffet only have pork, no other choice of meat! Bloody cheap crab stick want to charge! Bad experience, you will be disappointed!
4
Buffet was just those normal meats, Not worth it if you are picky with food. The Wagyu beef and Kurobuta Pork was excellent! Chicken soup Base was excellent but the Laksa was good too but not spicy enough. They have an Al Fresco area which I recommend because on the inside, one would smell like food after sitting for a couple hours
3
I had to give an average score as their service is really bad. we waiting for at least 30 mins for our food (each time we filled up the buffet slip). and their waiters don't really understand english. But their food are good, a lot of variety. I will want to try there again, but maybe on a weekday
