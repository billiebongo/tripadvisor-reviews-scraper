Came here for lunch. This place is popular with the lunch crowd. Ordered the combi rice plate with stingray and sweet & sour pork on the same plate. Nice!

I revisited this place when i book a place near the simple restaurant. It's extremely near Boat Quay but without the view hence you are paying for quality. One of the better local seafood place i have revisited. I would have given 5 star if not for slight service standard and cleanliness issue. Must try are Cereal Prawn, Fried Kailan with Garlic. For the more adventurous you can go for bbq stingray a local authentic dish which will cost 3 times the price if you cross over to Boay Quay. Suitable for lunch (set lunch) or dinner ala carte is a better choice. 3 dishes (small)plus 1 large beer will cost you around $40. The more people the better than you can have a taste of other dishes

After walking along the Riverwalk and being harassed from beginning to end, by restaurant touts, i wandered away a bit from there and found Macpherson BBQ Seafood, it just looked the part from across the street, so i crossed over and was pleasantly greeted, and shown a menu. Top right corner was what i was after, Chili Mud Crab, and it was fantastic, just as i hoped it would be, and then some, lots of sauce being sopped up by sweet little bread rolls, you get plastic gloves a full container of paper napkins, and, yes, you will need them, along with a couple IBC root beers i got a fresh lime juice that seemed to compliment the crab quite well.Overall it was a great experience, i will be going back to try some other items on their menu, the other brilliant thing is that it is very reasonably priced, go there

My friend living in Singapore suggests me here. I was there about at 9 pm, sat on the sidewalk. A lot of local people here (Friday night), some waiter/waitress can speak English. I'm Very impressed with all seafood dishes. Crab, shrimp and squid are very fresh. The best dish for me that night is "Crispy Cereal Shrimp", i have no idea what ingredients they put in it but overall is very yummy. The total price is quite expensive but i think it's worthy

Sidewalk restaurant. Great food at a pretty good price. Just off the river behind the more expensive places. Great food can not be said enough. They have their specialties and the crab is one. We had jade sand prawns and barbeque honey pork with of course a few Tigers

Yes have reviewed this before , but if you like good food and sea food at not over the top prices I recommend at walk to this venue , just above the tourist traps along Clarke Quay. Great food lots of locals also east here. Black Pepper crab, rice and a pork dish ,beer and some lime juices all for Sing 80.00

Well fellow Tripadvisers. You let me down deeply here. I took your advice and headed here for a quick bite to eat. I ordered the chilli crab - could not fault it and the steamed crab - did not enjoy it and two tiger beers and nearly fell over when they gave me a $130 bill. Are you kidding me? The crab was no bigger than 200g and according to the price list should have been about $20 max. Whilst I agree locals eat here, it's dingy and for that price I should have gone to Boat Quay where I have in the past and enjoyed a bigger and less expensive crab and enjoyed the views. Will def not return. Staff however were lovel

I have eaten at this great little seafood restaurant in 2015 and again this year, food and service great. Not far from the city just across the bridge near Clarke Quay , but no hustle or bustle like in the Clarke Quay precinct . Only about 7 tables inside and about the same on the footpath outside. Both nights I have eaten there I sat outside , no problems with traffic , a great experience. Locals eating there and buying food to take away. Pork and crab dishes ,very good and considered good value. Serves beer and some spirits. Food is considered equal to that Newton Circus food area
