Great food and service. Sashimi was really fresh and enjoyable experience overall. Would definitely head back

- sushi slightly above average amongst the sushiyas in Singapore- use of both white & red vinegar rice to match the different fish- recommended dishes: aji & akami nigiri, uni don, aburi toro, abalone and purple sea urchin nigiri sushi (?) [it cost $60 per PIECE before tax, so... you decide...]- mio lunch ($180) x2 + additional order of aji x2, tamago x1, aburi otoro x1, murasaki uni nigiri x2, awabi nigiri x2 came up to almost $850 (after tax)[aji was $30/piece lol.. can't rmb the price of tamago, maybe the other exorbitant prices made the tiny piece of tamago add on looked cheap so I don't remember lolx]mio lunch consist of tofu + 9 nigiri + 3 appetizers (seaweed, crab croquette, grilled amadai) + uni ikura don + 1 maki + tamagoin Japan.. you can get a much better meal (with all these premium ingredients & even more dishes/delicacies) probably around 700 for 2(ok... lets not compare to Jp but even in Sg, there are a few sushiyas better in terms of both food without that kind of pricing)- only think the price of the murasaki uni is fairly justifiable (from what I know about the various prices of the different fish)(+ never have been charged more than $30 for a single nigiri in Jp or Sg sushiyas lol)should have asked them? i think they wld probably reply 'premium ingredients'... lol - 1 poor dish: grilled amadai. although considered a rare & premium fish, the one i got was very fishy- service was quite good (do not usually care much about service, focus more on the food

Oh my .. the omakase that I had here wad unbelievable . PRICEY TO BE HONEST but absolutely worth the dime. Produce here is absolutely the freshest and the best a chef could ever get his hands off . Chef skills on this craft was like going to a show . It was mesmerizing to see someone whom dedicated their life in perfecting his craft. Brav

A highly personalized experience with superb food. There are eight seats at the bar and apparently occasionally a second bar is opened. We ordered the full menu with sashimi. The fish is super- fresh- the varieties fascinating. Certainly the best sea urchin I have ever had. Different parts of blue fin tuna are served. Some of the other fish was new to us- all excellent and beautifully presented

Recent years I noticed even some fine sushi restaurant stated to incorporate “ fusion flares “ into varies sushi plates and frankly been really dissapointed. This is specially true with “ Michelin star” places .. is often hit or miss.. I am always very skeptical even nervous about those places specially outside Japan. I was pleasantly surprise by this newly awarded 2 star little establishment . No gimmic no crazy smokes or gold flakes.. just solid material and “ craftsmanship”.. the use of the material in HANA set was worth the price tag ( as I was the only person ordering in the bar that day , allows me to compare the difference ).. I find the chef attentive to the details not only on the fish but even on the “ greens” that compliment the sashimi.The staff were friendly and attentive, they worked well as a team in the bar and outside the bar. This is definitely one my top choices around the world outside Japan

Make sure you have ample time not to rush, but to savor the dishes served, and experience the chef at work.

good but not great... i am expecting more signature dish out of this restaurant. any restaurant must has signature that guests should go back for particular dis

Visited Shoukouwa yesterday for the first time to celebrate my wife’s birthday. It was full house during lunch time with 2 guests ordering the sushi set lunch, 6 guests ordering the Omakase. The food was truly delicious and here are some highlights: 1) The freshness of the fish was undisputed and the flavors were amazing. The fact that they get their fish daily from Tsukiji makes them stand out for food quality.2) For the sushi, each piece was topped with the dark sauce which reminded me of how Sukiyabashi Jiro serves their sushi. This is the first sushi bar that I’ve experienced different types of vinegar rice paired with different fish - white & red vinegar. Subtlety done and the result was spectacular.3) The Omakase dishes were awesome and for a non-crab loving person.. I was knocked out by the freshness and sweetness of the crab dish. 4) The aburi grilling via hot charcoal was a nice touch... High marks for food and taste and in my opinion, better than Hashida and other top tier sushi joints in Singapore.I had an thoroughly enjoyable experience and would return for sure. As this is a 2 Michelin Star establishment charting high prices, there is elevated expectations and here are areas for improvement:1) consider having 2 chefs. Even though it is a 8-seater only.. the chef to diner ratio is the highest I’ve experienced at a top sushi restaurant. Most places in Singapore or Tokyo have a 1 chef to 4 diner ratio. 2) perhaps it’s due to the chef to diner ratio but the chef looked hassled. There was almost no interaction with the diners.. and the chef seemed to be rushing through his preparation (he was flipping sliced fish around the board - first time I’ve seen this happen at a high end sushi bar - Mgt don’t take my word for it.. pls discretely observe for yourself.). Garnishing of each piece of sushi was also a little rushed vs how other top sushi bars places would take great pains to ensure perfection.3) the restaurant is extremely small. It’s as if I was eating at a sushi bar at Tsukiji market vs a 2-Star restaurant. Owners should consider a new location. 4) Otoro didn’t look very fatty which was a little disappointing. I had the Aburi while my wife had both the raw & Aburi... it’s fine when grilled but my wife felt it could be of better quality

My first time visiting here. The restaurant is on the second floor of One Fullerton. Arriving is quite friendly atmosphere and warmth welcome by Chef. The Food is excellent even though not all of them especially the starter. But the rests are very fine. They are quite good in presentation, ingredients and taste. I think this is one of the best Omakase restaurant in Singapore. Somehow the price is quite high but according to ingredients using, I think it is inevitable
5
$1.1k for a couple's meal, its a 2 Michelin *, expect a (almost) flawless meal. May not be worth the $ but sure its worth a try
5
My first time to Shoukouwa for a simple lunch with my wife. always enjoy eating omakase meal in most top japanese restaurant like shinji, hashida and mikuni. this place is wonderful....all the fishes are top grade.
5
What a authentic Japanese dinner! My friend and I totally enjoyed ourselves at the sushi counter. Chef Suzuki San is professional and friendly, used his magic hands carefully prepare each course for every customer. Love each bite...
5
We arrived at the restaurant with very high expectations because our favourite sushi haunt has one Michelin star so this two star establishment has to be exceptional to win us over. Midway through the Hana course it was clear why is has what it deserves. Ingredients so fresh and exquisite then masterfully prepared by chef Yoshi made it an evening to remember. Highly recommended for those seeking an extraordinary sushi experience
5
We went for the mio lunch set, but it still had maybe 10 pieces of sushi. Such a treat to watch the fish being cut, grilled and meticulously prepared. A tad expensive but I guess it's because they fly in the fish every day. Would come back on a special occasion.
4
Sushi chef is Japanese, authentic sushi bar feel. Small restaurant, sashimi is fresh. Uni is v yummy.. price is 2 star Michelin price.. Not sure if it's value for money though.
4
It has a one Michelin star so I had to come. There are many omakase restaurants in Singpaore and I have probably gone to all the high end ones. This standard is well executed and a good place to come especially as it is near Fullerton. Unfortunately I can't remember any dishes / sushi pieces that I MUST come back for and may probably prefer to go to the other places
3
The ambience and service was good but the food was decidedly underwhelming for the price. There was no surprise or explosion of taste buds which one would expect from a restaurant so lauded by the Michelin Guide. Much better value can be had from other one star (or even no star) Japanese establishments. My companion and I came away feeling like our stomach was only half full and not an experience we will remember for too long

Came to know this newly crowned 2 stars Michelin Japanese restaurant in singapore and decided to come and try. Overall good quality, service and ambience were remarkable. There are 2 sides of the restaurant that can cater for up to 20pax . One with 12 and one with 8. Location is great with good assess to view Merlion and MBS. Welcome by a friendly waiter - Desmond and was helpful to warm me up. It served variety of special sake but is very expensive. Ranged from $600 to $3000 for 720ml size of sake. There are 2 main courses for Omekase. It comes with full courses that include sashimi and sushi - total 23 dishes and another is only sushi with 20 dishes. Great sushi and it was meant to be their focus and signature. However, the damage was quite a fair bit as 3 of us spent $2000 dollar for full course meal, one 720ml sake and one beer. The full course priced at $450 and non full course is around $370. Experience this 2 stars Michelin restaurant if you have Budget for this meal!

Classy and cosy setting where we diners sat at the sushi bar to witness and experience the chefs work their magic. Ingredients are airflown in from Japan on a daily basis and the seafood is very fresh. Prices are on the high side though
5
My wife and I went for the Hana Omakase. We had more than 20 different servings and thoroughly enjoy the dinner! Chefs are passionate at work and chatted with diners when situation permits. Rest of staffs also made us feel very at home. Thanks for the hospitality!Ingredients are of top quality and airflown from Japan. Place is small but intimate
5
Shoukouwa is tiny and the bar seats a handful of people, so book in advance. You must cancel in advance if you don't want to be charged. We had the omakase which was varied, fresh and top notch. You pay for the privilege, though and at almost 400 SGD per person without alcohol it's pricey. I am not sure whether it rates higher than Shinji at Raffles which I enjoyed just as much. Not for your everyday sushi fix but great for a nice occasion or if you like eating high end Japanese

One of six 2 Michelin stars restaurant in Singapore, and it does not disappoint you. We had dinner here and we went for the "Hana" omakase, accompanied with a Dassai 23 sake. The ambience was very appropriate and helps you to get into the food for a wonderful sushi omakase very quickly. The chefs and manager were very friendly and attentive to us. We even had a wonderful chatting session with the chefs, talking about our interest in the Japanese language and the various Japanese anime. The seafood was very fresh and succulent. Totally brilliant. Dinner was totally enjoyable as well, as the chefs went at a very relaxing pace. The best were the Uni (sea urchin)-based items. Chawanmushi with the green bean paste was surprisingly tasty as well. All the other items were a total delicate balance of taste and texture.Do call and make a reservation early. There are only 6 seats available from what we saw.Warning: A one-time meal here would make you never want to eat at the other mainstream Japanese restaurants anymore. I'm already looking forward to my next meal at Shoukouwa

My first lunch omakase at this restaurant and my third visit. It is still hands down the place to go to in Singapore. Menu was completely changed from the last time I was there two months ago. Fresh seasonal products from Japan used always. Perfectly prepared and blended. Attention to detail. Great job
5
We sat at the Chefs table where we could watch him make our sushi. You get a piece or two at a time so it is very relaxing. We had some very unusual sushi including my first time for Uni. I had lots of questions which were greeted with happy explanation. Once you go thru the front door of the building follow the signs. It is a little out of the way but well worth it
5
We had a very nice diner a japanese ambiance. The restaurant facilities shall not the motivation for you to come. It is really average. But the food !!!!!!!! Brillant !!!!! We really enjoyed our diner. quality of the food is really exceptionnal (like the price of the set lunch proposed...). Definitely a place We will visit again. Good service

We decided to try Shoukouwa omakase last nite despite some negative reviews we have read online. We are glad that we gave it a try. It is deserving of its Michelin 2 Stars. Every dish served was to perfection. The pairing of rice prepared in either white vinegar or red vinegar with the seafood was well done and it brought out the flavor of each piece of seafood. The ambience was a little quiet though unlike other omakase restaurants where we hv chatty chefs. Chef here is serious abt his food and leaves the chattiness to the male server who looks into our needs. We have made reservations for next visit.

Shoukouwa has a lot to live up to, famously earning two Michelin stars in a span of a few months after starting operations in April 2016. And I'm afraid it didn't live up to those expectations.I had dinner on a weekday evening. Reservations had to be secured with a credit card booking.There were two options for dinner: $320 vs the pricier $480. We opted for the former. Iinterspersed with the sushi dishes were cooked seafood dishes.The shari was perfect, spot on. Yes for some of the fish it was vinegared with red darker ones, for the lighter white fish sushi, "normal" vinegar was used. Whatever it was, it had the perfect mix of stickiness and bite.To be honest there was nothing to fault re: the sushi. Each was made with the right amount of shari, packed with just the perfect firmness, brushed with soy sauce, use your fingers and enjoy! Hmm!The cooked dishes were mostly good except the kinmedai, which I felt was a waste to have it cooked -- with a sweet miso sauce I think. It was just, ok.Shoukouwa, in my opinion, pales in comparison with Shinji and Hashida (I have yet to try Sushi Ichi). Both Shinji and Hashida exude warmth-- in the decor, of warm wood and colours and large cypress wood table top and lighting, and service from both staff and sushi chefs. Shoukouwa was very masculine. Granite walls and some wood. Lighting wasn't warm. Not one staff (visible to customers at least) was female -- ok, not that it really matters, but one of the wait staff (the only non Japanese) wasn't spot on 100% warm and friendly, look-in-the-eye professional service type one would expect.The seating of the restaurant meant that only a lucky two or four at most would get the best seats, watching the chef prepare the sushi. The other four (it was only a 8 seater long counter) would be watching quite faraway. I was seated right at the end, and right next to the curtain flap separating the kitchen. So yes, slightly noisy. There wasn't such an issue at Shinji or Hashida because of the design of the dining rooms. The sushi chef: there were two, one assisting the main. They were initially stern looking, not really being friendly other than the usual irrashimasu! I had to ask questions, about sushi, the chunks of fish, how long they were marinated or aged for, etc, before they became just slightly friendlier. Still not great. It's like as if they were reluctant to chat.(word limit?! See my review in Yelp

The freshest fishes flown in daily makes the difference! I'm a recurring visitor to this place and I love how they try to offer the various speciality and seasonal fishes and seafood straight from Japan. For a true gastronomic orgasmic experience try the 'Hana' omakase menu
5
I went for lunch and had the place to myself for a good hour. Watching the chef was an amazing experience - artistic. This is a master at work. His attention to detail and precision was stunning. I opted for the mid level omakase which was just right. All the sushi, sashimi and cooked dishes were varied, very high quality and excellent. One of the best sushi places I've been to.
5
Thoroughly amazed by the Hana omakase set dinner. Chef fed us well and we had a total of 27 courses, including two extra courses that we requested. Fish was fresh, just arriving from Tsukiji earlier in the day. The unique creations brought out the best of the produce from Japan and my guests and I were truly blown away. Having been to so many omakase restaurants in Tokyo, Singapore, Bangkok and Los Angeles, Shoukouwa now ranks in my own personal top two. Congratulations to Chef and Desmond for a fantastic experience.

Cosy and comfort place! Kind and friendly staff! State-of-the-art food, with each piece beautifully handcrafted right away in front of you! Simply sensational! Impressive!

Very impressive with the level of detail,freshness,display, skill of chef. I personally do not like ikura N uni but this place served very fresh and yummy ones that I actually finished all.

Overall food is nice and fresh. Feels the price is slightly over priced. Thanks Might go back only during special occasion
5
Quality of ingredients is superb and the seafood is exceedingly fresh. Sushi pieces are cut just right and props for the rice that really has its own character and yet blends in well with the fish, which is a relative rarity in Singapore. Whether all this is worth the staggering price is questionable, but in terms of quality alone, this place is fully deserving of its Michelin stars
5
Was my wife'a birthday. Amazing lunch with no other customers. Felt as though we booked the whole restaurant. Chef is skillful and ingriedients were great including uni and toro. The special thing about the nigiri here is the rice. There is white rice and brown rice depending on what type of fish. The rice has a tinge of crab taste. Will certainly come again

May be I expect too high. Nothing special at all . With this price I believe you can go elsewhere. I chose 480 set but only few things different from 300+ set . No doubt ingredients are fresh.

My local friends and business contacts always treat me to the best sushi in Singapore, knowing I am a big fan and can't get great sushi at home. We had looked forward to this meal with great anticipation, as Shoukouwa is the only 2* Michelin sushi counter in Singapore. I'm not a spoiled brat who would complain about good food, for the food here is not bad; but it's less innovative than at Ginza or Hashida and only slightly better than Tatsuya but much less fun. The minuscule and zen setting is far less impressive than Waku Ghin. What about service? A fellow dinner guest had hot tea spilled over his body and screamed out in pain. They should have replaced his soaked shirt right away; to my knowledge, they didn't
3
We had the hana omakase dinner. The food is very good - fresh and delicate. However, unlike at the other premier Japanese restaurants in Singapore, there was not one single 'wow' dish. Service is attentive, but less professional and smooth than at its top competitors. Finally, because the space is way too tight and the chef a bit stern, the atmosphere is much less jovial or pleasant than at Ki-sho, Shinji, Waku-ghin, etc; at this level of pricing, overall experience matters, and here it disappoints! I would not rank Shoukouwa among the top three sushi restaurants in Singapore, maybe not even top five
5
My family of 6 celebrated a birthday cum retirement dinner here. The freshness of the ingredients used and the skillfulness of the chef made the whole dining experience a really mind blowing one! Service was excellent & the cozy interior made it very intimate. Totally deserving of its 2 Michelin stars
4
we went for lunch. As there are only 8 seats, I was apprehensive that it would be cramped. However on the day of my lunch, it was not crowded. There were only 2 of us and another party of 2.The service was polite but I felt that the chef rushed our initial 3 courses so that we could catch up with the other dining party who were there first and had probably already taken the first 2 to 3 courses. In MHO, that seemed a little unprofessional of the chef.The food was delicate in taste with a build-up towards the stronger tasting dishes. Overall, they were well-executed dishes. Worth a visit
