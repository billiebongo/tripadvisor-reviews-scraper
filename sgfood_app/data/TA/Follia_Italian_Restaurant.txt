The standard of food is still good, however the amount of food on the plate has definitely reduced and the very delicious pork ribs has been removed from the menu

The service was good. The staffs there are friendly and pay attention to customer's request. Will definitely visit the place again in future.

The restaurant is set in a quiet estate with very nice interior and decorations. Food served were tasty and well plated. Really gave me a familiar feeling of visiting restaurants in Italy.

Visited with wife for dinner. It is slightly far away from city but worthwhile going. We took cheese, steak and pasta. Pasta was so so however steak and cheese was great!!

Made a reservation and requested for a quiet table for four. We ordered the mushroom soup, pasta main courses and tiramisu. Mushroom soup was tasty and authentic but could be a little less sweet. The linguine vongole and mushroom risotto were good. The spicy prawn pasta is delicious. Just a suggestion - it would be better if the prawns' shell were removed first as by the time, we were through, the pasta is a little cold. I would recommend this place or go again if I'm near Waterloo

It was quite quiet when we visited which left us a little concerned about the quality. Looking at the few reviews online, the place seemed decent. Ordered the beef ragu with ravioli which was delicious, but I had expected a bit more beef in the ragu. Frankly speaking, the main wouldn't have been enough to fill me up, and I am a small eater. Also had the spam fries, which were served in thin slices with a sweet chili sauce mix, and truffle fries which needed more truffle flavour. The steak and spaghetti puttanesca were good.After the mains, we ordered the chocolate cake, panna cotta and churros. The churros were served with nutella instead of chocolate. While the churros tasted good, they broke up easily, and didn't have the crispy outer shell you expect from churros.Service was efficient, and fast

Follia is a nice neighborhood restaurant. We went there as a family, looking for a change from our usual hangouts around upper Thomson.Staff was attentive, food was very good and reasonable. And, unlike some Italian restaurants around the area, This owner, Fabio, takes personal pride in explaining the dishes and recommending a wine to pair with the food. We were not disappointed, and the bottle was way more reasonable than what I would have picked.We will go there again

We ordered a main course each (a carbonara pasta and a mushroom risotto) and waited for more than 1 hr 15 min for our food. I was so close to cancelling my order and leave. We overheard the waitress who was trying to explain to other fellow patrons (who had also begun asking about their food) that there was only 1 chef that evening. Unfortunately, this piece of information was not made known to us when we first arrived.Finally, the food was served after the extremely long wait. The mushroom risotto was very good.The restaurant eventually gave us a 10% discount off our bill for the wait. I asked the waiter if it was usually this slow. He didn't seem to catch my question and even replied me, "Yes, Sir"

The term "hidden gem" is often overused and I avoid it, but if there is a place that fits this description, Follia is it. It is truly hidden, tucked inside a quiet residential area well away from all the "happening" spots. But those who know it will surely keep coming back.Food is good for the price. The menu has a well thought out selection and there is always something special on the chalk-board in addition to the usual favourites.There is a decent wine list that is not overpriced unlike most restaurants in Singapore.Fabio is an excellent host and the real "gem" of the place. He makes his guests feel really at home and relaxed. His staff and him are attentive without being intrusive. This is a place you go to if you want a nice meal - not just to eat but to dine

We were intrigued when we saw Follia nestled inbetween some other places on a terrace.We made our first visit last night and were pleasantly surprised. It is a very authentic Italian restaurant serving very high quality Italian food and drinks with friendly and professional service and all for a reasonable price.We will definitely be back
