This place is truly special. The menu is a very creative Japanese-influenced French cuisine. We were seated at the bar, but I believe there is a private dining room that can accommodate a larger group. Must try!

Excellent place to entertain clients. Mixed of Japanese and French cuisine and good service as well.

Was there for a celebratory lunch in November 2017 - service was very good and the food was incredible - well presented, tasty and portions are reasonable. I had the tea flight to accompany my meal and the teas presented were very distinctive and worth the price. Will return again when i have saved up enough

Been here last month for anniversary dinner. Everything was excellent from beginning to the end. Chef Yamanaka was splendid in his creation of Japanese and French while Eric ( whom i believe he is the Sommelier) pairs every dish with confidence and adventurous but on the point. Simply believe that in year 2018, beni will get 2 star! overall, i will return. Excellent experience

This is a small but a highly impressive restaurant which is deserved to be awarded with one Michelin Star.The service was good and the foods were simply delicious and creative. We asked the young friendly attendant Eric to recommend a sweet Japanese wine. He did a perfect job of suggesting Ginrei Hassan which was smooth and with a very light ferment taste.We ordered the lunch degustation consisted of three courses plus an appetizer. The bread was perfectly served warmed in a bag. The salmon salad, mushroom consomm√©, steamed egg served with dust of truffles and lobster served with three kinds of gravy were pure heavenly taste.Must try this place

There was only 1 menu choice available;the 7 course degustation lunch, where the main is either lamb or wagyu at additional $100 charge. Chose the Wagyu as i dont like lamb. Every dish was delicious, except the A5 wagyu which was too heavy and oily...but its because its A5. I wish they had other main than the lamb or the A5 wagyu. I ordered the wine flight and love the wine selection. A very reasonably priced delicious fine dining experience that is worth repeating

Went there for dinner on a weekday night and sat at the counter where I could observe the chefs in the open kitchen prepare every dish.I was blown away by (nearly) every course. Being a fusion restaurant, every dish had both a french and japanese influence. What was most striking was the perfect balance of flavors, a recurring theme. It is hard to choose a favorite at the end of the meal.Service was top-notch and the waiters are very knowledgeable, even to the finer obscure details of each ingredient.Being able to see the chefs work was a great experience especially with the head chef being relaxed and looking like he is enjoying himself.Overall, this was the best meal I have ever had (even after having eaten at several michelin starred restaurants). Although not cheap, the whole meal was definitely worth it. Definitely deserving of more than just one star and the "relative" lack of buzz around this restaurant

My previous attempts to eat at Beni have met with failure. The previous occasions even though the restaurant wasn't full & in fact was quiet, I was turned away as I didn't make a reservation. There were days when the restaurant was shuttered even though its website said it was open. Thus I was happy when I was able to get a reservation when I booked online, making it my third attempt. I went for lunch & Beni offered a lunch degustation costing SGD 88 for 5 courses and a premium degustation menu costing SGD 228 for 5 courses but with better quality ingredients. Aside from a premium Wagyu beef from Ozaki prefecture, everything else was the same. I opted for the cheaper menu with two additional courses, a scallop starter and a beef main course of boeuf bourguinon. Together with a bottle of mineral water & glass of champagne, this turned out to be better value. I thought the cooking was of a high standard & the use of premium Japanese ingredients exceptional but with all due respect to the accomplishments of the chef, it didn't seem like a Michelin starred restaurant, the way Rhubarb or Les Amis is. I would definitely return for some exceptional food but it didn't blow my socks off. My peeve was with the seating. Why does the restaurant insist on seating three parties right next to each other at the counter when there was a vacant seat at the other end when I requested it? 2 parties were there before me with 2 couples arriving subsequently after me. I'd asked if it was possible not to be wedged between two parties but was told the restaurant was full. It wasn't true the rest of the seats were booked out & I could have been seated at the other end. Besides the 9 seat counter, I detected a private dining room. I didn't notice if there were individual tables. Pricing of the two menus on offer at lunch was also disparate. The management needs to iron out these kinks in order for it to move ahead. The service was professional and friendly though. I had a good meal & would likely return

So I was expecting something spectacular because of the Michelin star. Dinner was good but not spectacular. Reservations were difficult to make. They did well emphasizing the very good quality ingredients but it seemed to be quite standard for the smaller dishes. The best dish without doubt was the fish - that was one of the best I have tasted in Singapore.

Superlative restaurant that gets everything right. Intimate but friendly dinning room buried in an upscale mall. Great, knowledgeable staff (which was great because they have quite an esoteric wine list). Consistently wonderful food prepared with great skill using top quality ingredients (tile fish was particularly noteworthy). I thought desert was fine (other have noted that it wasn't up to the level of the other courses - possibly, but only because of the super high standard of the other courses). Was worried about counter seating (they also have some tables that were fully booked) but that was still fun for our group of 4 on a Monday night. Well worth a special trip - very pricey but worth it. Should have an additional Michelin star!
