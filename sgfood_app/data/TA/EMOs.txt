One of the only bars in Singapore that sell asahi black, good atmosphere for having a drink with buddies or just drinking alone

I go here regularly with my dogs. The fish n chips are great, burgers ok, too much cheese for my liking, but can ask no cheese. Edamame beans are great snacks and so is the chicken wings.There is a Wife to this place with a pool table inside and sometimes karaoke. Mix of people from all walks of life.
