Nice ambience with nostalgic Nanjing feel.like the chef recommended dishes like the salted duck,Mei Ren porridge, etc. this is my 2nd visit and will go again.

Had the set for 4 today for lunch, there were about 8-10 dishes, all quite well prepared, most intrigued by the Chinese musicians playing in the background.

This is my third visit and I reckon that they deserve my credit on their food. Service is good but will be discounted when they are full house.I recommend their Spicy and Sour Fish Soup, Plain Noodle in Broth which is to me very authentic to the ones that I have tried in China.A good place to dine with family or friends

My friend and I ordered the following signature Nanking dishes: salt-water duck meat, fried noodles with duck meat, fried cabbage with vermicelli hot-pot, pan-fried gyoza and a ice-cold plum drink from a set-menu, as it was our first visit to the eatery.Place was rather noisy (staff and diners were main contributory factors) and uncomfortable for us even though we were seated in a remote corner of the premises. Staff were rather distant too.The interior decor (furniture, wall pillars, hanging lanterns) provided the excitement for us, especially to snap pictures and selfies.According to my friend who occasionally visited relatives in Nanjing, the food was authentic and satisfactory in tastes. The place would be attractive to diners who feel nostalgic about Nanjing cuisine or those who wish to meet up with friends for an easy no-fuss meal

Came here with the relatives to experience Nanjing cuisine for the first time. Food is quite unlike the standard Chinese cuisine I was familiar with - highly recommend the chicken dish, the porridge and dumplings.There is a stage in the restaurant where musicians perform, just like in the teahouses in Nanjing apparently. To do the experience justice, come early to get seats closer to the stage so you can properly appreciate these artists

My local friend and I wandered in here tonight - we came upon this restaurant by chance for diinner - we were suitably pleased we did.While it is in a major shopping mall the restaurant dÃ©cor and atmosphere is like stepping back in time to a traditional Chinese restaurant and tea house. Plenty of seating inside.Staff were dressed to match the theme - traditional music was playing in the background - it set the scene for the night and the food served.We had six really good dishes - all were good - Celestial Roast Duck Dumplings, Nanjing Vegetarian Delights, Beef floss Crepes...roll up in dumpling wrappers...yum, Deepfried crispy whitebait, Nanjing Impressions Pot Stickers and plum glazed crispy peanuts.We enjoyed our meal, service was ok - good value for two people

Three of us went to try this place. On first impressions it was a nice layout, good decor with nice music being played.Then came the food; desert first which was a shock... Then the rest of the dishes 6 of them all of which were average at best. Average probably reflects the average price ($76).From a value for money point of view it is OK, but there are much better quality Chinese restaurants in Singapore..

One can enjoy good varieties of Nanjing native foods which are in superior quality. Price is reasonable and affordable to most general public. The dining ambience is pleasant and neat, well decorated with Nanjing restaurant style, in-person Chinese music is played from time to time. Attendants are super courteous and polite. All menus are well entertained. Particularly its "Winter Melon" pork soup is recommendable

Just by walking from the entrance to the table is already a very comfortable feel. Great decorations, the wooden tables and chairs with a smooth finishing touch and especially the ancient paper lanterns on the ceiling. Really impressed on the first look.The restaurant is really huge as seems like they have private rooms and smaller alike cubicles for smaller pax. They even have entertainers which makes the whole experience just feel so good. Food is really great. Not too salty or bland. I would say it is suitable for all ages. As for vegetarians, this will not be a good choice as most of their vegetarian food are more of starters and dessert.Price wise is a little higher which I feel is reasonable. Service is one of those that really impress me. Before sitting down they even welcome you and will shout out some chinese blessing before you are seated. Will go back again next time

It is my first visit to this restaurant which was recommended by friends. The design is unique, staffs were friendly and attentive. The food was good especially the salted signature duck. It is a must try dish. The honey glazed lotus root was so sweet and not my liking. Overall, it is a worth a try.
4
Interesting decoration and ambience. Wide selection of food. The few dishes we tried were rather good, especially the Sesame-scented Beancurd Julienne. It was served cold, tasted light and refreshing. Will be back to try other dishes.

Cool ancient decor and lively atmosphere. The food here looks as good as it tastes, plenty of choices even for veg people like me. Love the fried rice cake (炸年糕)!

The decor, food and lively atmosphere of this unique Chinese restaurant is exactly like that of its original in Nanjing. A good place to bring foreign guests who to experience dining in an old Chinese tea house.

As many restaurants take an afternoon break before serving dinner, Nanjing Impressions is very flexible for people like me who always dine at odd hours. Having been there twice and once in Nanjing, I must say that the owner made an extreme effort in the decor and the training of staff. They would speak in an old Chinese way when you get seated and introduce dishes as they are served.As the waitress explained, we joined the membership programme paying SGD60 and got SGD70 worth of coupons back and from then on you can get 10% off given that you're not using it in conjunction with other offers (including coupons and certain sets). That's quite a good deal actually. The taste of food is quite special, quite authentic I suppose but may not be accepted by the locals. I love their noodles and it's cheap and good. The food is on the oily side but so as most of the local cuisine. Will definitely go back again.

Excellent decor, lovely music/band on stage. Service is very good. Pricing is reasonable. The one thing it falls short is the food! This restaurant is unique, however the question you ask is would you come back again. This is where the problem lies. The answer is no. Its a place for you to go once as its a novel experience. The 4 seasons of wine is quite nice as well. The food isn't special enough to warrant frequent returns. Perhaps to come back for a snack to enjoy to some music is more likely or a pre-dinner drink. The menu/food needs to be improved on vastly for customers to return to this place

Was in Plaza Singapura to do some shopping and their advertising signboard caught my eye, so decided to have dinner at Nanjing Impressions. The restaurant's decor and set up gives an interesting ambience of old China. Waiting staffs' name tags described their positions and responsibilities in the ancient Chinese form. Food was surprisingly good. Thumbs up to the restaurant. Tried the stuffed lotus root, baby rooster stew, beauty porridge and cold scampi in wine. All superb dishes to me. Will definitely return to try the other dishes that is on the menu

First time visiting the restaurant, not too sure what to order. They have a set lunch on weekdays and that helped narrow down our choices. The duck noodles that came with the set was quite tasty with veg on the side, so was the roasted duck with the sauce. Roast duck skin remains crispy despite being covered by the sauce. Cabbage with cur ed meat was also very good and fragrant. Tried the other snacks but the turnip pancake was crispy but there was no dipping sauce. Fried nian gao was crispy, sweet and nice, with peanuts and brown sugar. Guo tie was not very impressive though. Service staff was friendly and Kelly was helpful as well.Oh, the music was a bit too loud, sorry, but didn't quite understand it.... so kinda find it irritating

My daughter and I had lunch here on Tuesday. I wanted to try the ubiquitous Crystal Jade which is in the same shopping centre, but she's a local and she steered me away.We were seated promptly by attentive staff. We selected the duck filled dumplings, roast duck noodles and the Szechuan prawns. We also asked for some extra chili sauce. If you're a chili lover, don't forget to ask for this magnificent condiment. It's more of an oily paste than a sauce really, but it had beautiful flavour and texture, not too overwhelming, rather smokey and sublime!The dumplings were a stand out, you didn't get a undefined minced contents, but true roast duck flavour - delicious, especially with that chili sauce! We also loved the noodles and the prawns, there was so much food left over, they packed it into plastic takeaway containers for us to take home. As we had complimented them on the chili sauce, one of the staff members dashed off and brought us another little takeaway pot of chili for us to take home as well.Lovely service, delicious food, nice and clean with a bit of an Asian Disneyland decor happening all adds to a fun experience. I recommend it

~Celine recommended & I went with Victor to check it out, they spared no expense decorating the restaurant and all along the wall-less interior everyone dining inside can be seen openly by anyone walking inside the mall~at 6pm on a weekday it was brimming, FULL is what I saw and OMG the number of actual Chinese tourists from China having their meals here can be heard from Putonghua to Chinese dialects only native speakers can decipher, if they like it, it must be good~there's an air of authenticity that you cannot mistake and if you're used to mainland Chinese food that Chinese people really eat in Jiangsu province... you're in for a treat BUT if you're used to American Chinese versions of Chinese takeout kinda food, this will be a night vs day experienceBrown Sugar Rice Cakes - oh definitely like muah-chee (mochi) tasty YUMzSesame-crusted Fish Fillets - dry oily sorta clinical tasting, coulda been a rice dish and still won't be noticedDeep-Fried Crispy Whitebait - presentation 10/10 vs taste 1/10 dunno why it wasn't seasoned well but maybe that's how it should taste?Savory Radish Pancakes - unexpected outcome, oily to the bite, roasted but not burnt yet tastelessBottomline the effort it took to raise these cuisines up to our palates is already an impressive effort, I'll not rate this to my own taste preference but this must be experienced in it's entirety with the right perspective of Chinese delicacies, once or not at all is up to you

The old Chinese tea house dÃ©cor is charming. Probably the first Nanjing cuisine restaurant here, so Singapore customers will find its dishes quite unusual (roast duck with sliced beancurd in broth, shrimp roe, lion's head meatball, baked pork shoulder, cock stew with crispy sesame pancake, etc). They are good - some even very good, although overall more homey/less refined than Cantonese. Tends to be a bit salty. Friendly service, albeit not very pro-active
