This is one of the famous ba chor mee (try it) This comes with both the dry and the soup version. I prefer the dry version and my uncle loves the soup.

This is one of the best pork Minced Noodle in town. It's located at Bedok North BLK 85 hawker center. It's noodle texture is very chewy and the soup is rich with strong flavour an full of minced meat. Pork ball used is also very tasty. A good place for supper

Blk 85 Fengshan Food Centre has two known bak chor mee noodles stall and Seng Hiang is one of the two. The stalwart is Xing Ji which serves only the soup version. As for Seng Hiang, it has the flexibility of soup or dry version. Noodles from both stalls taste similar and the wait for food with Seng Hiang is usually shorter. This is my choice whenever we do not have the luxury of time
