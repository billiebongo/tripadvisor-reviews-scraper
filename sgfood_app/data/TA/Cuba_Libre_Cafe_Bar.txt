Excellent service. A true latin live band. A bit over the expensive side but worth it. And OMG, everyone dances and dances well. I mean salsa, bachata...
A good fun place. Is now on my list of places to be.

We came here on a Friday night and it was absolutely BUZZING, perfect for unwinding after a long week at work!
5
A must visit place ... good music good food good service ... Live band is excellent ... people who love dancing and wants to enjoy good music should not miss this place ...
5
place has latino music playing and is great for western dancing
enjoyed quite a bit here and hadloads of fun dancing
pretty neat and would love to spend more time here

Cuba Libra was my one of the best dance club. It was really enjoyable, very good music and atmosphere. I really really like it. I would definitely suggest you never regret!
5
Cuba Libre was great! Went there with my girlfriend and we couldn't stop dancing! Live music was great and the DJs were just as good!
Highly recommended!

It was very very average. I mean how could you get nachos wrong....the cheese was not even melted - chicken nachos.....my husband had luke warm over cooked lamb chops that were supposed to be a rack - right now we are paying for our 2nd dinner - step it up Cuba Libre or don’t serve food if you can’t offer hot food & service
5
Been a customer since 2007 and been loving the vibe the place brings. The moment I stepped in here for the first time, I felt like I was in South America. That's the vibe that brings me away from reality. The biggest serving of Mojito I've ever since. The food serving is definitely enough to fill me up for 2 meals. The band and the DJs, awesome!

Incredible rude security guy , we were celebrating the bachelorette of our good friend and another friend stepped onto the stage for a minute and the security guy slapped her harm , telling in a very rude way she was not allowed to be there .I found that very disturbing , obviously that is not the way to treat a customer, specially a lady , who wasn't even drinking because she is pregnant , I argued with the security guy asking him why he was so impolite and a lady staff came to ask us to leave (her fking club : that's the way she called the place ),after we complained to the manager but he was not really concerned so we had to call the police to help us make a point on this unfortunate situation.Bad bad bad
5
Wanted to have dinner before heading to Zouk for the night. Stopped here to enjoy the music and a couple mojitos. The food didnt disappoint. I had the chicken fajitas and my wife had the shrimp fajita, each dish was tasty and a little spicy which was excellent. Mojito was great. Wish we could go back for another go at the menu
4
It's a really good place if you like Havanna, Latin music and a live band. Service is good, staff is fast and friendly. So everything is there to have a good time to enjoy!
5
Fabulous music, great Beats and banjo, exhilarating guitar... some fabulous dancing crowd ... 12th night was awesome there
4
Friday night salsa treat. Seating available outside so street-watching was fun. Nice choice of food and drinks, we tried mojito and rum... nice. Great music and a live band too. Clarke Quay gets very crowded but it all adds to the ambiance.
5
Great mexcian food that's the closest to being in Mexico that I've tried in SG. The fajitas are delicious and the ambience of the places is a good place to unwind After a Long day out.

Thursday night was supposed to be ladies night and you get 50 percent discount on loose drinks but guess what? if the man pays, you don't get the discount ' It is policy', says the Operations Manager. It smacks of insincerity, and oh, if you don't ask you ladies don't get the free drinks also. So head down here and get your free drinks from 8pm to midnight on Thursdas. AND MEN, DON'T PAY! Let the ladies pay amd pay them back later. Sheesh! As for me? I am never coming back
4
The food is excellent and very tasty which made it hard to chose from. The staff is a bit slow and not very attentive. As a solo diner, they sat me in a corner away from everything. The atmosphere is authentic and entertaining. I would visit this restaurant again and would suggest to friends
5
We visited on a Monday night whilst on our honeymoon for drinks. The live band were awesome! The singer was so encouraging of all new patrons to get up and dance, he asked many of the ladies to dance even if they didn't know how. It made for a fun welcoming atmosphere. We would definitely visit here again if in Singapore. Clarke Quay is wonderfu
3
Went there looking for a place to dance salsa. In the whole night got to do that probably 3 times. The rest of the time the band and the DJ kept playing each other's songs. Band has a limited repertoire and repeated some songs. The worst was the DJ who actually played some songs 4 times (not kidding). I you're wasted enough you will not notice but if you appreciate dancing it gets really boring
5
Wow we (family) ate a lot at this restaurant considering that we were all watching our diet. We finished everything stripped to the bone. The service was fast the food is superb the drinks are great. Here's what we ordered- Prawn and Rib-eye fajitas, Chorizo, baby-back ribs, gambas, nachos and ofcourse mojitos. If you come between 6-9pm for every order of main dish you get free order of appetizers.Definitely now one of my favorite restaurants
4
We stopped here just to have a quick cocktail before heading out for another meal. Our cocktails were fantastic - big, lots of taste and quick service. We were kicking ourselves as the food that was coming out looked and smelled amazing! We shall be back
3
Went there for drinks with a visiting friend. She loves a Cuban bar. The drinks were diluted for both of us - the alcohol just too little while the prices more than nearby bars.
5
The best beef fajitas that I never eat around the world. The beautiful manager has been very kind and she offered me a cocktail. I will come back there surely!
3
The place has nice music and drinks. But below average food. On the whole please visit only during happy hours.
3
The food here is alright, it is a little pricey for value. But the atmosphere created by the live band is phenomenal. It is one of those place where you come as strangers and end up dancing with a bunch of randoms but having a complete blast. The entrance is one drink which is about the same as other clubs. It costs around $12-18, depending on what you buy. If you want to dance the night away then this is the place to go
4
I met a friend for drinks here last night. We chose to sit outside as the music inside was a little loud for talking - but it was a pleasant evening and it was comfortable enough to talk with friends. The drinks were good (Moscow Mule was my favourite) and the food was perfect for sharing. The only downside is that it's a little expensive - nothing unsurprising for Clarke Quay though
3
We visited here late Sunday evening, the live band had just started their set and half a dozen locals doing their stuff on the small dance floor, a bit loud but that is to be expected.We chose a plate of cheese nachos for starters, it was huge, more than enough for two hungry people, because of this we then shared a plate of steak fajitas for our mains. With a beer each the bill came to S$ 105 (approx Â£54).The staff are young and seemed a little inexperienced but still worth a visit
2
Cuba Libre has underwent some renovations and the place looks more like a restaurant than a bar. The Band is ok, service sucks, servers are rude and the ambience is too bright for my liking. You can see everyone in brightness ... not the usual ambience of a bar/club. If only they could dim the place as before and work on the service standards , this place has great potentials
5
Jenna is an awesome ambassador of Cuba Libre, she knows everyone and all of them love her and when you have had some drinks that is always a good thing.On a side note, the chicken wings with floss is great bar food and same for their thick spam fries
2
Love the Latin music and cocktails. Pricey but worth it. However recently the attitude of folks has been shocking and very high handed. The service at the bar leaves a lot to be desired and the management is just plain rude. I wouldn't go there again.
2
Staff there did not seem to know their menu very well. Went expecting a solid experience but was dismal. The Cuban beef sandwich (A "cubano") was horrible. The steak was tough and hard to chew. The caramelised onions were ridiculously sweet. Clearly they added sugar to the mix and ruined the entire sandwich as it was engulfing the meat. The "truffle fries" included were pathetically little and had no flavour, not even salt. For well over $25 it was terrible. Its saving grace was the Cuban Dream Martini which was incredible. Would not reccomned to anyone wanting to eat
5
Amazing stuff, excellent service and great music. Highly recommended for a fun night out. Inside is more for dancing and outside is perfect to catch up with friends.
4
Great venue
Good atmosphere
Attentive staff
Excellent drinks
If the weather is good sit outside and enjoy the people watching and Clarke Quay experience
4
Great atmosphere, food was amazingly good. Will definitely revisit and recommend my family and friends
4
Great food that's reasonably priced. They have a couple of happy hour specials that are great options. The service was rather average but nothing terrible.
5
Lovely little place to enjoy a Mojito!
Staff are friendly n welcoming !
Always a good night out at Cuba Libre
4
I went here because one of my good friend works here as one of band singer....i love the piña colada...will definately come here again
4
Great food, Mojitos & Of course Cuba Libres, this bar has life Salsa Bands on weekends, if you are fun of Salsa, and want to loose some kilos in Singapore, then this is the place to go.
5
Awwww. This place was my highlight food of the week.The place was quiet since we came early. Light upbeat music, without a band, we were told the band would come at 10pm later that night.The food was gooooood. Ordered the chicken quesadilla and beef enchiladas. Both really good, large in serving of meats. The flavour was strong, slightly salty and mildly spicy. It came in large serving sizes, all cut up and good for sharing across the table. The service was good. We didn't order drinks, so they gave us iced water. They paid fine attention to this, and never let it go empty. Definitely coming back soon
4
This is the place to be if you're looking for the typical South-American atmosphere in Singapore. They often have a life band with an outstanding performance. Caipirinha's and Mojito's are delicious, however the level of alcohol can vary from day to day. I already had very good ones but unfortunately I also had Caipirinha's and mojito's that tasted like lemonade. Just hope that your bartender is a good one and you will not regret your visit. Especially try their super large mojito's
4
I'd say it's nice. It's just intimidating to dance on the floor, all of them seems to know how to salsa. And dancing hiphop or any other modern dance other than salsa would seem out of place. Too bad, we should've practiced first before coming to the bar. :)We only had one drink, I'm not sure what it was, but it tasted really great. I think it's mojito, with sugarcane. Overall experience, just okay, not bad
3
Good salsa music and dancing. Drinks too were great! My wife and friends enjoyed the evening as it was buzzing...! A good hangout if you are looking for something to do on a Sunday late evening/night.
4
Great evening good food and drinks and good vibe. Good fun.
Always a good evening fun was had by all.
4
Delicious food served and nice salsa music for dancing. Great for a girls night out. Will definitely come again.
3
simple mexican food. great location. very busy. could improve service. took a while to clean up our table.
4
Spent an evening there last week. What a brilliant place. The music was incredible and the atmosphere rocked. Loved it.
Food and cocktails were average, but who cares when the band and music is so sensational.
4
Went to Cuba Libre with a large group of friends. It was a Saturday night and they had their weekly band playing - they're Colombian and they are pretty awesome. If you're from South America, you'll know that the music they play is not really the newest stuff, but they were really good and so it didn't really matter how old the music was. They work the crowd well and people love them. The place gets pretty full by about 12:30am and remains full till about 2:15am. The only dress code is that men aren't allowed in flip flops and sleeveless shirts. Shoes and shorts are just fine as with most places in Singapore. There is a cover charge to enter - you just pay for whatever you want to drink at the door and then collect at the bar. Point to be noted: Don't buy multiple drinks at the door even if you plan to have more than one drink inside because 1. The bartenders don't understand the concept of drink one now and drink one later. They will serve you all the drinks that you paid for at the door upfront and you'll be left with a couple of pints of warm beer. 2. Drinks are actually a little bit cheaper inside. The prices on the menu at the door are inflated. In short - The choice of alcohol at the bar is a little disappointing but the bar service is more disappointing. The bartenders and staff are a bit snappy - if they were a bit more cheerful, it would make the place much nicer. We will probably still go back there because we had a lot of fun and the band was awesome, but that's only for the music and dancing

I was looking for some soulful funky music in Singapore, and was advised to go here by a local singer.The Bar staff who are locals are very nice and welcoming and professional.The owners are Colombian NOT Cuban, and typically very insular.The owners coupled with friends in the middle of the dance floor the whole night making punters feel very akward and unwelcome. The insular group occupying the center of stage constantly gave strange looks to people who are buying expensive drinks to support their business like they shouldn't be there. They should learn to be inclusive to everyone in a multi cultural city or go to some New York Ghetto or back to their country. Singapore is a friendly international place. not for this type of insular behaviour.It was very strange the owners acted like the place was their home and nobody else is welcome. even tho its a public bar in downtown Singapore.Very StrangeWaste of money with owners looking at you like your the enemy.These people are clearly not ready to run a businessThe good service is down to the local staff,not the racist colombian owners who dislike all non hispanic
4
we went there on a Sunday night and it was almost full.. had the best Mojito ever (which is also a cover as you need to order something to get in) great music and if you are into salsa you will love it. deff a place visiting while you are in Singapor
4
The live band with salsa music is excellent. Very lively and enthusiastic. Entire band is from Cuba. On Sundays the place is packed with enthusiastic salsa dancers. They have a couple of in-house dancers who dance with the guests.The food is good - the chorizo sandwich was very good.The service is terrible. The servers are not interested - poor attitude.Drinks are quite pricey: $18-20 for cocktails
3
If you love Salsa music, its a great place to go. We just had drinks so I don't know what the food was like but we did enjoy the band which I believe were from Columbia. We went to Cuba Libre as we were told it was all Latin songs but a lot of other type of songs were played. I think it spoilt the atmosphere a little cause it is called Cuba Libre and you do go in with the impression that it is a Latin club. Nevertheless the whole area surround Cuba Libre is very entertaining to walk around. Lots of bars, cafes, restaurants and entertainment. PS. you have to pay upfront for your drinks before entering the Cuba Libre. So you choose from a list of drinks, pay and then the bouncer allows you to enter . He stamps your hands. At first I found it a cheap way to deal with people but after some thought, I really don't blame them as a lot of people have their drink and walk out without paying. Its so crowded, you can't possibly keep a control 
4
Although it's expensive in terms of 16 to 30$ for cocktails and shots. It's still worth it as it was a great place for salsa and some good fun.
4
I personally love latin music and dance. This place served me right for everything. Great mojito and dancing... I love it. only one thing could improve is staff. to be more professional and smile....
4
It was my husband's birthday, but we had no firm plan.. we just moved into this place, enjoyed some live music... reminded me of my days on the Caribbean islands and Mojito is truly recommended.
2
I have always been a huge fan. I was there last week and the music has become more 'commercial' and the band are playing more pop music which is a shame. Perhaps it was just a bad day for the band as the lead singer was just not good that day. The service is good. Drinks are expensive but still 'okay'.
4
If you want a to dance Latin music like salsa, reggaeton, bachata this is your place! I'm Venezuelan and was traveling with an Ecuadorean and we were so happy to find a spot were we could dance and listen to live music by this legit band. We stayed up until last call! Everyone there is up for dancing regardless of were they were from.Por favor no sirvan mas cuba libres con bacardi!!! Cuba libre es con un buen ron añejo como diplomático :). Orgullo venezolano!
4
I had a really wonderful time in this bar and I stayed until the last song. I loved that there was a real Latin American band playing music that made us all want to just relax and dance our troubles away. The only thing I didn't like much was that we had to pay a drink to enter. And it was kind of expensive (sorry I don't remember exactly how much it was). But we were actually a little unfortunate because we got there 30 minutes too late to have a free entrance. So, my advice is to get there before 10 on lady's night so you don't have to pay to enter.
5
Really great service and atmosphere. Waitress was extremely helpful pointing out offers and recommendations and also advising us of the live music. Really good food. A very enjoyable evening out, dancing area and pretty decent band too. Good offers on drinks too for Singapore if you visit at the right time. Would definitely recommend
4
We enjoyed the great drinks. The mojitos are huge and tasty. The music included a live band playing salsa, and lots of people were dancing, even on a Sunday night the dance floor was full. We really had fun dancing and drinking salsa in Singapore. An unexpected treat
4
It's a tex-mex type place which I understand hosts bands and gets a bit lively later on in the evenings but I've only ever gone earlier during happy hours. The two for one meal deals and discounted booze makes this one of the more attractively priced options in an otherwise expensive Clarke Quay setting. Some of the cocktails are pretty big and they have a good beer/drinks selection overall. Whilst the food that we've tried would probably be at the lower end of very good, it's all been perfectly edible and well worth the money
4
Service was good and the manager on duty was very accommodating. My cousin asked for recommendation of beverage and he suggested Mojito but she said she didn't like the mint. His reply was " we can make one for you without the mint".The one-for-one meal offer was indeed a pleasant surprise. One of the items we ordered was lamb shank unfortunately the taste of the lamb was a little too strong for us once the food turn cold.Ambience was great, music volume was just right during dinner allowing us to chat without having to raise our voice and enjoyed the music selection.
5
Cool place. Among the better bands I have heard in Singapore. You have to pay for one drink to enter. Slow, but among the frendlier staff in Singapore. How the drinks will taste strongly depend on which bartender mixing them.
4
live vibrant and great live music. Never tasted food here so wouldnt know . Drinks are reasonable by singapore standards although the sangria taste a little bit too fruity and less alcoholic.Try to drink by glass …
5
This was a surprise! We went looking for light meal and was surprised at the quantity of food for the price and it was very tasty. The toher sur[prise was that as we went for dinner before 8, they had two for one drinks. Getting 2 Glenfiddich scotches for $16 was the icing on the cake. Don't miss this place
1
Why this restaurant is so expensive for a middle quality of Mexican food.The music and place is nice but after 9:00pm you must pay a first time because the team shift, event you want a other drinks or other thing to order they don't care.After a discussion with the manager Anic I don't thing so the aim of this place is to satisfied the customer but just make money !!
2
I've been here a few times and have usually had average experiences - nothing to really write home about. But my recent most visit here was an absolute disaster. I was there during their Happy hour 1-1 (on house pours, beers, and wines) promotion. I got a white wine while my partner had the beer. The wine was first, not even standard quantity - they shouldn't have a 1-1 when basically the quantity of both glasses put together equaled only one regular - second, tasted like it was from an open bottle - not crisp or fresh. It was a huge let down. The food was very average - the cheese sauce on the nachos tasted industrial, store bought. The only saving grace was the potato wedges, but that couldn't do much to outweigh the others. I'm definitely not going back

Dear Owner, this is a feedback for your outlet.I am from India, and am working as a Airline Pilot Sr. Commander with an International Airline, today i visited your outlet at Clarke Quay, Singapore, and was speaking to some friends while they were drinking (I was not drinking alcohol not even beer, i repeat i was not drinking, that is why to verify my soberness i am writing this right after my return from the Cube Libre, Clarke Quay) and to my surprise one of your bulky Security in charge came towards me, and pushed me aside and told me that step aside as he needs the table, i told him "please don't push me, and speak verbally" and i got an reply you come outside and i will show you, by showing me his hands and showing his anger by grinding his teeth, he charged towards me.There were some of the female guests at your outlet one namely Anna, from Yorkshire UK, who were drinking at that time, the act was so violent that M/s Anna, came up to him and intervened else it seemed your Security staff was going to Abuse me physically.The security staff infact told her to clear the tables as well, she replied that we have bought the drinks from your outlet and she has couple of sips and she will finish them and leave, but was told you take the drinks outside but leave now.She asked for the manager who repeated the same words as narrated by your security.Quiet Surprisingly i have never seen such ill mannered staff at any place on this planet, obviously she got infuriated and said to your Security please mind your language and behave properly with people around your bar, but the security person misbehaved further, and finally miss Anna told him that this is no way to behave with people, just because you are on steroids and muscular you cannot behave rudely with your guests.But to my surprise the security staff, almost pushed me and other lady guests from the premises, just because he had to clear the tables, is that what an Asian hospitality is known for.i understand you have a well established business, but if your staff continues to misbehave, you will be left with no other option than to wait for customers while they will turn up at other places, due to rudeness of your employees.i will end on this note, and wish your organisation good luck in the future,Warm Regards,Capt Pawan Kuma

Ended up here after a visit from Zouk in the morning of 23 Feb 2014 , latin music can be heard from a distance.Our curiousity paid off , because so much fun in the Cuba Libre.Enterance fee was $ 19.Lo on to their site cubalibre , to download their food and drinks menu , events and promotions.This place was relatively small compared to other clubs around. Crowded with people, and have some serious latin/salsa dancer moving around.Live and energetic latin/cuban music from the band.Their specialities were Mojitos, reasonably priced about $ 18 - 28.Serves various foods like the House Specialities , Aperifitos , Sopas Y Ensaladas, Salsas and Burgers,and Tapitas in an acceptable prices.Different style of club, stand out among others , worth to be visited 
3
Went on a Tues night so was pretty quiet early on. Food is more tex-mex than Cuban. Good deal on beers 2-4-1 happy hr. Food was quite good and reasonably priced. Service friendly if a little confused at times. Would go again for drinks and snacks when live music
4
After going around Clarke Quay area several times, we ended up in Cuba Libre. Live Reggae music, cocktails (including the eponymous drink), attentive wait staff and good looking people: check!The drinks come in huge glasses, priced around SD 13-18 each and generally taste good. I ordered something called El Diablo (tequila, ginger beer, lime juice). It was crisp and well-balanced. The others in our group ordered apple martini, margarita, watermelon (virgin) mojitos and the Cuba Libre. The only drink that was a bit off was the mojitos- it was too sweet, almost fruit juice like. I guess it is difficult to make non-alcoholic mojitos taste like the real thing. In terms of quantity, the margarita gives more bang for your buck as it comes in a gigantic glass.I would go back and try the other drinks (the Desperate Housewife sounds interesting)
4
we went there after dinner and we took only drinkswe heard the latino music from the roadwe stayed inside and first it was a DJ running the music but around 10H45 a four band begin their show -- it was goodi took first a beer and then a mojito which was very good and made in a glass jar ( like the marmelade jar ) full of menthe leaves and ice i like it of course i will come back when next time in singapor
