First visit to Wheelers yard, variety of food include vegetarian. However there can be more fish dishes. Decoration is unique and nice for selfie or wefie. Normal Non-alcoholic beverages can be a little bit expensive.
5
Wagyu beef was fantastic and so is the lime squid
Love their buttermilk waffle. The crisp of it makes it come up top on my list for the best waffle in town!
4
Had a sumptous dinner at Wheeler's yard. great truffle fries!
Would love to have more flavours of milkshakes here!
1
I visited this place together with 3 other friends for dinner. to be honest, this is the worst food ever. I requested for a surprised slice of cake to be served to a friend as it was his birthday but the staff came to my table(in the presence of the friend) to ask me to come n select the cake for the surprise. Seriously? The staff ruined the surprise. Secondly, the food. It was the worst waffles ever. It was burnt. Our garlic bread was also burnt. I had to return n ask for a refund. Never returning back.
5
The Wagyu Steak and Cauliflower Furikake are a real treat! I usually get a craving for steak once in a while, and the steak just melts in your mouth and is further enhanced by the home made smoked salt which makes each bite just that much tastier. As for cauliflower, I am not a big fan of the vegetable, but the way its fried with the crispy batter just makes it really delicious
4
We had the burger, and fish & chips which were pretty good and satisfying. Its an open space for seating, so it can get alil noisy depending on the crowd. the rustic hipster look is a thing these days, and they do it well. Cant complain, we had a pretty nice experience there.
4
Nice place for a gathering. The fried squid from the starters section is nicely done with every bite full of crunchiness. The main courses were of adequate portions and a good variety from the menu. The Suki beef bowl is yummy. The carrot cake was a good choice to end the meal!
4
Singapore's most famous hipster cafe. Got the following:Suki beef don - average. Nothing really special.60 degrees chicken breast - I don't usually get breast meat and still probably won't. But the sides won me over. The corn and mash went really well. But if you ask me to eat chicken breast on it own then no thanks.Mentaiko pasta - super creamy can get very rich. Flavour was nice though. Black pepper lime squid - not bad but then again nothing special. Furikake cauliflower - my fave dish. Get this! I used the furikake to season my chicken breast in the end haha.Overall, slightly pricy but OK good was decent. Wouldn't mind going back there.

Nestled in a quiet part of Balestier is this quaint little place which is part bicycle shop and part cafe. We decided to give it a try as there were good reviews in social media, it was New Year's Eve and we wanted to usher in 2018 with a new dining experience (besides being bored with the usual fare).We started with a few of the chef recommendations like 60 Degrees Chicken Breast, Suki Beef Rice Bowl, Mentaiko Pasta and ended with the Homemade Buttermilk Waffle which came with assorted fruits and vanilla or chocolate ice cream. They all tasted great and we were not disappointed at all! Hope to be back again to try other menu items like the brunch items and Ultimate Beef Yard Burger
4
Our first time here and everyone was satisfied with their food. Their signature Suki Beef Rice Bowl (medium rare) & Ultimate Beef Yard Burger (medium) were all done nicely, above our expectations.Water is free, but coupon parking applies on weekends and PHs . If menu prices are lowered, all of us will be coming more frequently for sure.
4
Nice open area where kids can run ard. Beef bowl is my favorite. My kid loves the cold tofu. Another fav among friends is the fish and chips.
4
Causal dining and great for families with kids. The beef bowl was very yummy and my Daughter loved the cold Tofu dish.
4
The premium cut wagyu beef is very good. The fish dish is a 20min wait. Fish is fresh and worth the wait.
4
Food was good and worth the price. Ordered the iced chocolate and was a bit disappointed, but overall the experience was good
4
Enjoyed the food here. Esp. the lime calamari. Will be back for more. Not crowded at all on a weekday night...
4
I liked the food choices available at the cafe and will definitely be back to try the rest. The coffee was pretty good too. Will also need to visit the bicycle shop section in the mext visit.
4
Great chilled out place for dinner or any kind of occasion throughout the year. Having dishes special, example Xmas special delight.Great ambient even thought with kids and great big place for them to run around.Good recommendation if you have mileslife apps, so that double up ur miles while dinning at the same time.Prices were reasonable and staff very friendly along the dining process
5
The ambiance, the decor, and interior and exterior is so instagramable. lovely place and nice for photo taking. The food is great too especially for brunch, you can find good coffee too and sit and chat for a long time here. Free refill for plain water and free wifi. I ordered Salmon Blinis (portion is good for 1 person), Mentaiko Potato Salad and Suki Beef Rice Ball (all didn’t disappoint)
2
Wheeler's Yard is worth a visit if you have completely run out of ideas and need to have a very average brunch with some friends. Nothing we had was worth the calories - not the coffee (cold brew), not the matcha latte, not the breakfast plate (Rise and Shine), not the truffle fries, not the onion soup (not french like they claimed), not the Caesar salad, not the eggs Benedict, not the grilled chicken. If you've already eaten, just fancy a coffee, and aren't fancy about coffee, and would like a different setting from the usual, then Wheeler's Yard is your place
4
This is a great place to come to whether you're alone, with a loved one, in small groups (4-6) or in large groups (10-15). I've been here for to spend some time by myself (working or just chilling), with a loved one, and for a large gathering with kids, at various times of the day, at the outdoor seating area and indoor seating area. The ambiance is that all-encompassing and it's so spacious that it's just wonderful. The free parking (4 in the compound and maybe about 10 in the neighbouring building, look for that bright sign) is a great draw too.The food and coffee are above average, interesting (fusion) with vegetarian options. The cakes are not fantastic but if you're feeling peckish and need something to go with that coffee other than those old-school fancy-gem biscuits that come with your drink, they're alright. If I were to recommend one thing to try, it's definitely the Masala Chai Latte. With all those spices in that drink, it's as real as it gets
4
Good place for brunch. They have nice ambience and quality food. However, this location is quite inaccessible and their food prices are on the high side.
5
An amazing hangout for cycling enthusiasts especially because of all the bicycles & Cycling-related paraphernalia. Good coffee & dessert too!
4
Food was relatively good, staff is friendly. Getting here is much more convenient if you drive and parking lots are limited.
Food quality is alright but the salmon is salty.
5
Unique as you can buy bicycles and accessories. I love the food but on a high side. The latte is nice. A good place for coffee too. Good services but lack of parking places.
4
1st try... went there with family (parents and kiddos), 7 of us, for a nice Sun brunch and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food and the laid back ambiance. Bought 2 of the set menu and it was definitely value-for-money....Grilled Stockyard Angus Steak and Tiger Prawns... However, it was already cold when we got it from the counter.... would be nice it was still hot off the grill!! We tried many other dishes (pasta, finger food, desserts) and every one was well received, especially the triple trouble (must try if you are a choco fan!). Will be back!
3
Nice setting. Coffee is average. Seating out side and in with good air conditioning in the cafe area proper.Moderate array of food options. Reasonanly priced.Visited multiple times during time in Singapore but mainly because of convenient proximity to daughters apartment in which we were staying.Definitely worth a visit if you're ok with average..
3
Adequate parking lots if you're a driver.Food was ok, only..Not a baby friendly place. We were requested to keep the baby stroller outside and only bring it in when needed. So my poor friend have to carry her baby until we collected(self-service) all our food, then bring in the stroller to rest the baby.Might as well just let us have the stroller with us since we will use the stroller.
2
Lovely concept cafe. Spacious and airy, a welcome change from the crowded shoeboxes masquerading as cafes. But that is as far as this place gets. The food is terrible. I got the English Breakfast and it arrived quickly. Sadly, everything on the plate was cold. Like it had been prepared several hours ago and simply assembled on a plate and served. I could complain but I know better. I just wont return.
4
You need to reserve before going to this place- as it gets packed!Brunch is ok- limited options. The rise and shine is quite expensive for the food variety they included, 2slices of bacon(they can add some other options like, ham or chicken sausage).Fish and chips is good- different from the usual dory fish.Eggs benedict is yummy.Great place to hang out...Yet to try truffle fries...looks appetizing..
1
Very disappointed with the service and food. Cashier was not attentive and didn't cancel the item we asked to cancel. Staff offer to pack for us if we can't finish the food. Ordered the waffle with the ice cream which cost $16+ as was recommended to be good, but to our dismay, we found that the waffle was not freshly made and was so hard and totally tasteless. We complained about it but the staff brushed it off by saying she would let the kitchen know. We were neither offer any refund nor an apologise. This is unacceptable
5
Good Food, portion is just nice, flavour taste good. Atmosphere is good, not that crowded, able to sit down and have a nice chit chat with friends.
4
Just like the concept and the foods! Space and atmosphere was pretty good. Foods are so yummy! The truffles fries is kind of different.
4
Big workshop type with bicycle shop. Interesting concept and nice food being served. Good to hang out with friends
4
Food quality was good but the price is on the high side. Great ambienxe for big groups. Visited the cafe on a Saturday evening and was surprised that it was not crowded.
4
Food and coffee were not bad, I like that the coffee was served old school iced gems cookies. The restaurant's decor was very interesting (decorated with bicycles).
3
Gd atmosphere n interesting food, will be good if the Citibank promotion is still available. Provide water
3
This is a good place for coffee and catch up (especially on a weekday) but don't expect much of the food.There are only 4 lots for car parking, so you'll be better off cycling there (it's right next to the Park Connector Network) or just park nearby and walk
4
Had a lovely lunch here. The ambiance is lovely and a great place to relax. Our coffees were excellent, an iced latte and a hot matcha latte. Foodwise, both portions were very small for the price being paid. We were expecting more than one sausage for the 'bangers and mash' as 'bangers' means more than one but only one was served. Given that there was only one, we would have liked more of the side of puree which was delicious. Also there the miso flavor/smell was lacking and it didn't seem like there was any at all otherwise the pork was cooked beautifully and went well with the kimchi and rice. Would go back for drinks but food is lacking in value although quality overall is very good
3
The mushroom pasta I had was too heavily flavoured, too sweet and too salty. The breakfast that was served to my sister was lukewarm, scramble egg, harshbrown, etc, I was expecting it to be hotCoffee was not up to my expectation as well, macchiato was too acidicI didnt try the truffle fries but could smell it from other table. Self service caf
3
Particularly loved the chicken breast as it was cooked very well (sous vide) and the creaminess of the mash with the corn added a great texture. Wish there were more hazelnuts, or small bits of hazelnuts for more crunch.Very disappointed with the panna cotta. It sounded great. The supposedly honeycomb felt like it was some sticky brown sugar that was way too sweet and hard. The consistency of that panna cotta was not right (too much gelatin perhaps) and quite tasteless.Nonethless, the staff were friendly and service was timely.
5
Great place and great food (the truffles fries were interesting). The staff were friendly as well and it is cool seeing bicycle parts all over the place :)
2
In general environment/food is ok, but the price is expensive for the amount served. Self service mode .
1
Average food and the pet area is horrible. i will not go back there again. Not worth it at all. and the food is expensive and not worth the money.
3
Waffles was nice but the main courses was so so. Went on a fri night, wasnt crowded. Booked via chope and spend for 2 main course and got 1 complimentary
4
An interesting all day cafe dining experience combining a bicycle business with a self-service cafe. Prices are generally fair.
4
Their signature food and drinks such as Matcha coffe, salmon speghti are good. Caesar salad was an outstanding and recommended
1
Disappointing. Prices are high for a self service restaurant located at a remote place in Balestier. Ordered a Wagyu burger for about $30 but the bread was so soggy that I had to eat without it. The meat patty had unchewable bits of muscle or something. Presentation and the Fries was good though
4
Some people in our group had a hard time finding the place, but it was well worth it. Great atmosphere, nice food, Instagram-worthy drinks (the frozen espresso ball is fantastic!).Unfortunately, thanks to all the complaints from people online that they had to walk more than once to collect their order, now they wait and alert you only when the last item is ready, so your food might be hot, but your frozen espresso ball already melting and your matcha latte cooled down, so you may want to check on your order in-between.All in all, a great experience, will be back for more
4
I liked that the venue was out of the way (less crowded) and really spacious (high ceilings & wide spaces). That said, smaller groups tend to have to share the same bench which means lesser privacy if u're kind who prefers it. But its good for friends to have brunch and spend a chill morning together.We were there for brunch and had the usual eggs benedict/scrambled eggs which were fairly good. Overall a good relaxed sunday brunch
4
The layout of the dining tables and chairs are a bit tight, if the restaurant can look into this area, I believe the dining experience for the dining would greatly be enhanced. We were seated at a corner, going in and out to order and collect food is kind of a hassle as the next table guests would have to make way for us to move about.Foodwise, yummy no doubt but the portion is a tad small even for a small eater lady like me, let alone for guys
3
Second visit to this place. Was hoping that the quality of the food improves after a change of menu but it's still as mediocre as it gets. We ordered the don and mentaiko pasta. Both taste was below average.
1
Foods are not that fantastic and slightly over prices. Atmosphere wise is normal. Nothing great about it.
4
Uber cool bike shed setting with lots of biking gear for sale. Great coffee and yummy food. A bit pricey for what you get but nice.
4
Nice and relaxing place to have a meal. However, felt that the food is a tad average and kind of pricey.
4
Bought a gift card from Fuzzie and thought would give it a try. Was pleasantly surprised that food is good and atmosphere is equally great
4
Food was good but a little pricey. Ambience is good for gathering. Food variety is good. No service charge.
3
They wanted to charge birthday corkage initially ... Unbelievable! They waived in the end but we were subjected to a min. spend. Overall, there were some hits and misses.
4
This place has a nice ambience although a little out of the way and not easily accessible by public transport. However a simple cab or uber is sufficient to get u here. The food is average to be honest but to have a cup of coffee and enjoy the ambience will be a nice experience. Good location for parties
2
I know a lot of people have talked about how amazing Wheeler's Yard is and I was so excited to finally be going there. The location is hard to get to and it's especially hard to find parking in the nearby vicinity. They have their own parking space but I missed it as I drove by it because their 'Free Parking sign' was pointed towards the exit of the free parking so I had to make a U turn before giving up and parking at the shopping mall nearby. The food is quite expensive and I ordered an iced latte and sous vide chicken. The food came first before the coffee and all this is self service. I think my chicken was undercooked because it was light pink in the center and it was quite chewy and not tender like chicken should be. However when I sent it back, they told me that this was how the chicken was supposed to be. I was like alright, but as I continued eating I felt kinda queasy and I just stopped eating and ended up eating the sides. I don't think I'll be coming back to Wheeler's Yard again based on this experience
4
I had a latte and the granola for breakfast and thought it was very good. The coffee was wonderful, some of the best I've had so far in Singapore and the granola was relatively big and had fresh fruits with it. In a way it's self service. So you order at the counter, you get a buzzer, and then you pick it up
3
Settle into a large warehouse with all sorts bicycles surrounding you, while you tuck into your Steak. Wheeler's Yard is an interesting concept, however lacks a certain finesse in service. Particularly if you are seated in the non-aircon space.
4
Went for a friend's birthday, not located near the usual town area. However, the venue was beautifully decorated and foodwas good :)
5
Went there for brunch with my girlfriend and we totally love the ambience that they've created for the customers. Staffs were friendly and helpful too. Highly recommended to whoever that is reading this! :)
2
It's is valentine day. Serving of food is slow. Waited for 1hour for the food to be serve. Food is so-so.
4
The food was really amazing. We ordered almost all the starters and mains as we were a big group and everything was delish. The vibe and ambience was really cool and hip too.
1
I visited wheelers yard last week and it just reminded me why I have never wanted to come back to this place. Food quality has not improved, for the price that we are paying. Coffee is fine, and that's all. For the price you are going to pay, and the effort to get to the place, we deserve much better I'm sorry.
5
The food and parking situation at Wheeler Yard is now much better and has helped the overall experience. We had the suki beef bowl with a beautifully sous vide egg and grilled daikon. The cauliflower fritters were well executed too! Overall a laid back brunch location. For those wanting to ride/scoot/skate, it's right by the park connector so it's super convenient to stop for refreshments.
4
The service there was self-service but was welcome with a smile when you enter Wheeler's Yard. The food there was good, and definitely suit a coffee lover if you like coffee as it really smell and taste and it provides an enjoyable atmosphere for my family and I to dine there.
4
Heard a fair bit about this place. With some good and some not so good reviews so I decided to judge for myself. We arrived after 8pm on a Sunday evening. It was fairly quiet but the lack of a crowd gave us a chance to take a good look around the venue and the bicycle shop. We loved the way the place is set up and it is certainly very unique for Singapore. Food was good and the waitstaff 'ok' overall. Menu was a little bit on the high side and because of this we will not be back in a hurry
3
Finally got to visit this place after hearing quite a lot from friends - some are cyclist Wheelers also sell bikes and bike accessories, and also heard from friends who live in the Balestier area recommending many popular makan places near their homes.We decided on a Sunday night and we thought it would be safe and quiet given that its still within the Chinese New Year season and things would be less crowded at western food eatery. Still, my kids said we should be just place safe and make reservations for dinner. Done. The kids said this is actually a very popular place.We tried the lemon pepper calamari (squid), truffle fries, mentaiko salad. For mains we tried the house special burger, an alio olio, snapper fillet and 60 degree chicken fillets. There were 5 of us and shared all the 3 starts and one of my daughters and I shared the burger. The food is all orders, paid and the self served/collected. A buzzer signaled us when the food as ready. It all came together. everyone was quite satisfied with what they ordered. My favorite of the evening as the black pepper lemon calamari.We saw another table of guest order something different and it looked very nice and interesting and we said we'll be back to try other things. As its self service, there is no interaction with the staff except for the ordering and payment time. The place is airconditioned, very comfortable and spacious. The theme of the internal renovation and decor is based on the "bicycle". Its quite popular with the younger folks and people who cycle. Accessibility is a bit of a challenge as its not near the main road (Balestier Rd). Still worth exploring and trying out
4
we went on a Tuesday night and it was really quite. Drinks were great value, food nice. Off the beaten track
5
We were taken here by a local. It's hidden away, but definitely worth a visit, particularly if you're into biking. Very nice selection of cakes and they have soy milk if you have non-dairy coffee.
1
The food we ordered for breakfast was far below standard. Expensive and really not value for money. I seriously doubt I will be back.
4
It turns a warehouse to a significant cafe. Guess what, it stills a bicycle warehouse, but inside, it convert it to warm atmospere cafe.
Black Pepper Lime Squid is a must try !!!
There are tables for group gathering also.
4
Great place to chill with friends on a Friday night! The food was good too. Will like to specially mention about their Truffle fries and Black Pepper Lime Squid! A Must-Try! Their carrot cake tasted great too!
5
I've read the review featured in the Straits Times sometime ago and decided to check the place out. I'm pleasantly surprise to find this warehouse turned into a restaurant and s have such cool and nice ambience. Food is good and delicious. I ordered the Suki beef while my companion had the teriyaki salmon. Staff is efficient and provided professional service. Will be back again as I like the place. To note :The place has limited car park lots but you may want to park at the nearby Balestier Plaza car park which is about 7 mins walk away. Price is a bit on the high side. Spent $60. Self service. You decide on what you want and order at the counter and pay. Wait for your food to be ready and go back to the counter to collect.
4
Located in a warehouse against a bicycle theme. Creative decor and for bicycle enthusiasts, am sure you can find a thing or two to add to your bike. The food is good but a tat pricey. Overall, a nice place to hangout , to chill or to just be away from the hustle and bustle of the city. It might be me , but getting a carpark seems to be a challenge. Worth a try and who knows , you might well be Cycling back home with a brand new bike to work off the calories and cholesterol

We ordered egg benedict ($17.90), grilled chicken ($18.90) and one mocha ($6.50). We've been wanting to come here as the place sounds cool and nice but we were quite disappointed when we saw the menu. Wanted to leave but my husband suggested why not just try since we already there.No service charge but the price was definitely already included service charge *roll eyes* and utensils were dirty.Super disappointed when we saw the food as the portion was so SMALL. Egg Benedict only has two eggs, two thin pcs of ham, two pcs of buns and 'leaves'.Grilled chicken only has some small cherry tomatoes and beans. Coffee was SMALL too!Worst cafe I've ever visited. No more next time =
3
I have lost count of the number of times I've come here. The dilemma is the food is good, but the price has inched up so high it is way above average in prices of similar cafes. Truffles fries probably the most expensive in Singapore based on my standards. I will still come but will not be that frequent. Ambience is good, the sous vide chicken is good.
4
Housed in industrial warehouse, this place is a bit out of the way and we took a 20-minute stroll from Toa Payoh MRT as parking spaces are limited at location.The decorations are creative with bicylces and their parts and accessories. The food is reasonable but pricey considering its location. It will be perfect if the place offers the right kind of music on friday nights chillout
4
Went for team building lunch, it was a cosy and nice environment. The food was yummy, next time will try to chill out.
3
Good environment for a lazy afternoon or night out. However price point is too high for the lack of service. Food offerings can be further improved. Overall lack X factor for repeat customers.
5
A great place to chill for a coffee and desserts over the weekend! Great decor and generous space. It's like a large warehouse with antique as well as new cycles and cycle gear.. Nice sporty feel. A must go.
5
My dining experience here was amazing, the foods are very delicious, the ambiance was very nice and the staff are very friendly and accommodating. That's why we always coming back to this place... Thank you guys all for giving us a good service... Excellent 👍🏻👏🏻😊
4
First taken here by expat locals this is a frequent stop for me now on my regular business trips to Singapore. Great food, relaxing vibe and quirky surrounds make this a must visit. If you're a group of more than 4 make sure to book as this place fills up fast
5
Wheelers Yard is a restaurant in a bike shop in a warehouse, or maybe it's a bike shop in a restaurant in a warehouse... either way, it's well worth a visit! Industrial and friendly, the locals are on to it and may be keeping it a secret - I wouldn't blame them at all! Menu is small, but excellently done - something for everyone (even the teenage vegan), and dinner meal size left us satisfied, but with room for dessert. Parties of 4 and up should book, and easy seating for solos around a massive central table. Fantastic place to eat, hot spot in the making
4
Refurbished bicycle warehouse with casual wooden benches and bicycles and bicycle accessories to create an unique ambience! The food is surprisingly excellent - The rice bowls (beef, pork belly and salmon) are really good. My favourite is the suki beef rice bowl. The crab cakes and truffle fries are the best! Black pepper lime squid was unusual and a more interesting version of fried calamari. The beef yard burger was succulent and served with a soft egg. We had a sweet end to our meal with yuzu creme brûlée with matcha ice cream and a luscious sea salt caramel cake. The latte and sweet peach ginger tea were delicious. It's self service so you order and collect your food at the counter. There's a shop in front of the shop to buy a wide selection of bicycle accessories and we got a pair of gloves - high quality and good price. There's good and free parking available in the property next door. Very convenient

1. Concept 5/5It is an old warehouse refurbished into a vintage bicycle shop and trendy restaurant. Displays of bicycle parts, bicycles, helmets and frames are used cleverly to differentiate its decor from other modern restaurants.2. Ambience 5/5A grand feeling of space is created due to the very high ceiling and generously sized tables. There is indoor and outdoor seating available. Given the local weather, indoor seating is preferred. The famous blue front gate with the red bicycles is an absolute Instagram icon so remember to snap photos before walking into the restaurant.3. Service 3/5The restaurant allows reservations for 4 pax and above. Reservations are strongly advised if you plan to have weekend brunch. Weekdays are usually not crowded so walking in is never a problem. There is no 10% service charge imposed as customers are required to order at the counter and collect food on their own.4. Food Quality 3/5I have been to this restaurant 3 times this week and tried a wide variety of dishes and drinks here. The dishes are plated beautifully. However, the portions are small and the taste is average. Do try the signature dishes for the creativity, but do not expect to be wowed. 5 days ago, during my first visit, I was just informed by the counter staff that the menu was recently updated.5. Value 3/5I generally consider food quality, in relation to price, to have the highest weightage in this category. At this moment, I consider the food to be a bit overpriced. Take the burger at $25.90 for example. I can find better tasting and bigger sized burgers along the same street.Overall, I rate this restaurant 4/5 because of the refreshing concept and the atmosphere. I believe the owners will improve the food quality over time so I'm looking forward to an improve menu in future
4
Western breakfast for a local crowd. Great coffee, friendly service. We had eggs Benedict and coffees, $49 for two. Not sure why, but you just relax when you walk in. Maybe it's the warehouse feel, rustic deco and odd-ish furniture or the genuine smiling faces. No pretence here.Hard to get to without a car, but t we'll be bac
4
Went on a weekday afternoon lunch. Nice environment and the set lunch is value for money. $19.90+ for a set with a starter, a main and a drink. (No service charge) Food was nice too. I really like the small tomatoes that's come with my grill chicken, is super sweet! I had the grilled chicken set and my partner had prawn Aglio Olio set. I would say the grilled chicken is a better choice. I would recommend you try the set for first timer, of cos ala carte is fine too. Nice environment.
5
I love bikes and being in this bike workshop / showroom / restaurant was an awesome experience.
The place was decorated nicely and the food is great! I'm sure you'd love to stick around and take photos.
3
We came to find some bike tools but end up having coffee at this nice place. Very unique and cool. However very unfriendly staff i would say. No smile atleast.
4
- Situated in a former warehouse.
- Good place to hang out with fellow cyclists over coffee.
- Good service.
4
The food is western style, with asian influenced. I've ordered the signature burger and I really loved it. It is stacked with bacon, cheddar, caramelized onions, tomato, lettuce and best of all, half boiled egg. The eggs just nice to moisturize the thick burger patty, which both are the perfect match!Besides the food, the bicycles, the garden, as well as the wagon are good for photo shooting
4
I like how this place provides a good view of some vintage style bicycles. Prices are friendly but remember they have rental to pay for. Cafe space allows for discussions in small groups up to 9 with spacious tables. Come for your team lunch with a long table up to 24 seats. Tell me about team bonding...The coffee I had was overly roasted and tasted bitter. BUT, I'm not here for their coffee. Title suggests, here just for a weekday peaceful afternoon and inspiration for some creative work project.Enjoy! I hope you driv
4
First you walk in a bike shop. And then you walk further into a restaurant full of bikes. Bikes / motercycles are in the middle of the tables. Very cool decoration.2 huge LCD screen on the wall. A bit distractive if you don't dine alone
4
Very enjoyable and relaxed coffee and lunch, in really interesting surrounds. Took my toddler along with us and the kids meal and service was brilliant, while the proliferation of things to look at kept him thoroughly removed. Food was of high quality and good choice, one of the better coffees in town too

In an era when cafes are mushrooming up every day, Wheeler's Yard really has a clear direction of where they want to go and take this place to. Got to love their courage to do things differently to distinguish themselves from the rest.They might have stumble in the beginning but like all businesses, they would have their teething problems. But they picked themselves up, got in professional help & advise and now they are back on track with even more offerings than before.Wheeler's Yard has always been my coffee-shop-round-the-corner since they are just round the corner from me. i have watched them from the beginning to where they are today and it's a warm feeling to know they are always there when i need a bite, need a drink, need a treat on a diet cheat day.My all time favourites will have to go to....✮ Truffle fries✮ Oh lulu (calamari)✮ Otah burgerOthers on the menu are yummy too, and they do have new items every now & then. Perfect for dinning anytime of the day.Uncle Tommy has been a familiar face to wave to every time i walk by at the park connector behind. Thank you for being a great "neighbour".More exciting plans ahead!! Watch out!

On the hunt for the perfect spare bicycle for our needs I discovered quite by accident this incredible place Wheeler's yard on the web whilst searching for a classic older bike. A fascinating eclectic range of bikes and cycling memorabilia everywhere in the venue. I think it would be a great unique venue for a private party too. With the cleanest toilets in a Singaporean restaurant I have visited. This is not the easiest venue to reach. Take a taxi from the MRT for the most efficient way to get there. And be warned there are number of one-way systems that can even confuse a taxi driver that does not normally work in the area. But worth the effort on a bright day if you don't have a car. This is a cool venue to hang out if you are a cycling enthusiasts or just want somewhere different to eat instead of all the bustling busy Hawker centres, restaurants etc deep in the shopping malls. They serve some very nice western food. Here you are more exposed to the fresh air and sunlight away from the busy streets and built up areas. Food wise, the daily special was a very good deal. Costing less than the main meal itself for I think a three? course lunch. Mains were about $20-$30. Check the web menu out. Its self service once you are seated. I had a filling all day breakfast which was a little greasy as another review suggested but the eggs were plentiful fresh and not overcooked. Lovely Canadian style bacon. If it wasn't so far away ( we don't have a car) we would go more often. But will certainly go there with guests for a good all round unique Singaporean experience.

We visited this place today and saw a few chic Harley Davidson parking outside. Decorations inside is also unique and cool. Tables like a school cafeteria, share with many peoples. All chairs different low and high. This place provided absolutely none service. You order at the counter and collect alarm tag. When it peep you walk over and collect your orders. Drinking water also self service. We only try flat white and ice cappuccino which were average. It took 25 mins to get it. After reading about how long it will take for food, we didn't try it.

The Wheeler's Breakfast was over priced as the quality and taste has nothing to shout about. Coffee is not warm when served. The food quality has to improve! It's an interesting deco that's all.

Let's start with the restaurant - SO friendly, people sitting on big tables and all chatting along. So many dads with babies too...they're that welcoming!!The food looked amazing, but on the day I visited, I would say it was just a little bit greasy for my liking (cooked breakfast & a chicken breast). That wouldn't stop me trying again though, as the taste and presentation were great.After food,a trip outside to the "barn" which is a cycle service centre, hire centre and shop. The breadth of cycle accessories for sale was staggering - most cycling enthusiasts will come away with something - even if its only a "Wheelers Yard" cycling jersey.It's a little bit far from the MRT, so maybe take a taxi, drive or cycle alongside the canal to get there. But this is definitely one of my favourite places to visit

Great chill-out place especially for bicycle lovers. Cafe is littered with beautiful bike deco, e.g. frames, helmets, wheels etc. Indoor and outdoor seating available, with a garage selling cool bike accessories, including some vintage looking bicycle and parts. Bicycle trailer available for sale. Situated beside a park connector so very accessible by cycling

It was really unique concept and if i had not walk in to the yard, i wouldn't have realize that it is a restaurant. it was a pretty packed afternoon in wheeler's Yard and we manage to get our seat. Service spot on, and attend to our needs. we had our coffee and dessert and snacks, And will try out the main course in future. definitely will be back again !

Bike decorations on the table certainly give off a nice vintage feel.I got the latte [$2] and the Mentaiko fries [$4.80] from the Sugar app.The latte was a little too bitter for my liking but the fries were great!In terms of location I would say its pretty hard to get to if you dont live nearby, but I myself had not problem as it's barely 500m away from where I live. They have bike parking spots at the cafe too and will lend you a lock if you dont have one

We took a bus from Toa Payoh Station and it was a decent walk from the bus stop. It was a good thing that it was nearing 6pm, so the walk was cool but bright enough.The interiors are great especially for bike enthusiasts with the array of bike choices and paraphernalia. We ordered the calamari which was cooked well, although I wasn't a fan of the batter they used. I enjoyed the affogato the most. :) Apple pie was decent not spectacular

This is my second visit. I am glad that they have removed the car parking restriction inside the gate. The steak hanger was delicious, very well prepared, sweet and juicy. The spring chicken is a tad dry but otherwise enjoyable. The ambience continues to be enticing and sets the mood for a lovely evening

I visited Wheeler's Yard recently and was quite impressed with the owner's usage of the factory. It is converted to a cafe, alfresco, retail and repair servicing for cyclists. The cafe is uniquely decorated with different types of bikes on the serving tables and the ambience is awesome. It is not quite easy to locate the place though and the range of food is still good for a chillout!

Located in a bicycle showroom, it makes for a very interesting location. Bikes and Coffee - yes and yes!. The menu is small but has good options for big or small appetites. Prices are reasonable for Singapore. The problem we encountered was the length of time it took to receive both our coffees and meals. We visited on a wednesday at around 11am. We were one of about 10 people there. There is no table service so upon placing your order and paying at the counter you are given a buzzer. The buzzer rings once the order is ready of pick up. The problem was that only 1 order was ready so my partner got his meal. I had to wait a further 10 minutes for mine to arrive which kind of ruins the vibe of a lazy brunch. Having visited various cafes in Singapore during our 12 day stay, this was the only one that we encountered these issues with

Crowded place with high expectation on the food but the food turn out to be so-so only. Abit disappointed. no doubt, the atmosphere is good.

This restaurant offers a unique concept. It doesn't looks like a restaurant from outside and the location is in narrow road rather than in Mall or main road. Actually this is a bycicle store but they expand it to be a cafe instead. They also put real bycicle as decoration here and there.To order, you need to come to cashier and it can be crowded and noisy.Went here to look for dessert and coffee and nice place to visit

We went on a Saturday afternoon for lunch (during CNY 2015's 2nd weekend) - just in time to witness a staff event taking place right after the main doors. I was told to "come back 15 minutes later" to place my order while the staff event was ongoing. While I understand the necessity of the staff event (a Lo Hei session), I found it strange and awkward that I was not allowed to place my order first (have the order keyed into the system first).So eventually a while later, I placed my order for a Chicken Yard Burger ($15.90), a Buttermilk Waffle with Chocolate Ice-cream ($12.90), and a Long Black ($4.00).The chicken burger came with a thick patty that did seem homemade. It had a satisfying bite and was grilled and marinated just right. The fries was also pretty crunchy (yet not burnt).The waffle ice cream was nothing spectacular. The waffle took the shape of a waffle, but did not have that texture of a waffle when you bite into it. It was like biting into a "waffle shell" with nothing inside. I guess the waffle batter they used was simply not thick enough. The chocolate ice-cream was pretty average at best too.The Long Black did not have the aroma that a long black should have. I did see the barista working with an almost empty coffee bean grinder at the counter (indication of beans having been inside for some time already and probably gone stale).While Wheeler's Yard had a nostalgic ambience, the place was too cramped and very noisy. As I was trying to enjoy my meal on the bench, it was very disorienting to be constantly "rubbed" in the back by the other patrons walking around behind me as the walking space between tables is simply non-existent. If you do patronize this place, do get a seat that is away from the main tables in the center of the restaurant.Did I say that the music there was a tad too loud as well?Probably the saving grace for Wheeler's Yard is that they don't charge for Service (10%). If you want water, you can get it yourself from the water dispenser. Upon placing your order, you are issued a RFID tag that will alert you when your order is ready at the counter (self-service). Kinda like Marche I suppose.To reach this place, you either gotta have a car, or you gotta take a 5-min hike in from the main road (Balestier Road). Oh, and remember to bring an umbrella if you're going in by public transport - you're going to be stuck at the restaurant if it rains

Tonight, for the first time, we sat at the great outdoors this cool evening, where the courtyard was spacious, windy and well-maintained. I like the white patio tables and chairs.I ordered the Caesar Salad since I was not really hungry.- it consisted of the usual goodies such as lettuce, croutons, cheese flakes, a very small sprinkling of hard boiled eggs and the dressing, along with teeny bacon bits. As mentioned before, very few people could toss a Caesar wrongly, hence this was a rather refreshing meal.The Beau had the Spaghetti Carbonara (SGD$14.90) which was a rather huge portion, and had the standard shards of ham and creamy sauce. The pasta was a little soggy, and the cream was too rich in this case - after a few bites, it got kind of difficult to go on (unless we poured loads of Tabasco sauce or chilli flakes over it).We also tried the Horlicks Tart (SGD$5.50) - while the crust was nice in a crunchy manner, the flavor was lackluster in Horlicks' maltese aroma. There was a sticky layer inside the sweet tart that tasted like a suspicious cross between Horlicks and caramel. Well, it was our first Horlicks tart, so we couldnt really comment much, other than that the crust was nice and the tart was sweet with sticky fillings.For full review and more information, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2015/02/dinner-at-wheelers-yard-cafe-revisit.htm

With family coming over to visit for the holidays we wanted to bring our guests to go have a nice meal someplace new. Scouring instagram and Chope! we chanced upon the Wheeler’s Yard. Our family loves bicycling (well most of us) and this place sounded just right. Finding Wheeler’s Yard with Google Maps is very easy down to the very bus stop and number of meters to the front door of the restaurant. If you are commuting and the weather forecast predicts rain, bring an umbrella. Its a bit of a walk from the bus stop. Bringing a car? There is parking available on a next door building complex, I assume you will need to pay for. The facade (it looked like we came from the back) was very simple, a baby blue steel door with their name painted on it; and a fixie bicycle perched on the edge of a roof. After taking a few customary selfie/wefie shots we went inside. You will be greeted with a row of red Chinese bicycles and, upon entering the warehouse, you’ll see a bicycle shop with classic bike models in display. We were hungry so we immediately rushed to the left and entered the air-conditioned restaurant. We were lucky to get a table quickly and we absorbed the restaurant’s bicycle inspired ambiance. Its a self service restaurant; place orders at counter and you will receive a wireless buzzer device that tells you your food is ready for pickup. If you have multiple orders, they wont get the device from you until all your food and drink has been ready (that means a couple of trips back and forth from the counter). The Food*Truffle fries: of all the fries we tried in our series of restaurant hopping, their version is the best, crunchy and delicious, truffle taste just right (no gasoline aftertaste)*I had a spaghetti bolognese as they had run out of the hamburger that I wanted; the serving amount was just right, warm and filling to the stomach with the noodles al dente as expected*I ordered an ice cappuccino, loved the foam and the refreshing blend perfect after that warm walk from the bus stop*The price is about midrange, and I believe I got my money’s worth. The Ambiance*The place has a home-y relaxed feel, the patrons ranged from toddlers with their parents to yuppies having a great time.*Feeling full? One can get up and check out the bicycle shop outside and choose from the merchandise. They even sell GoPro cameras and accessories. *The staff were very friendly, courteous and helpfulOverall, I would come back and have a taste of their burgers and the rest of their offerings

Good start of the year at Wheeler's Yard.The food was nice and tasty. The atmosphere was good but a bit noisy if you want a quiet place with your friends. Lots of younger hanging around the place.The location was a bit deep in if without car. From the main road you need to walk a distance.

Stumbled on this quaint place while on a run. Love how it is so close to where I stay. Finally a place to have friends over, hang out and chill. The atmosphere is simply unique. Adore the whole cafe in a bicycle shed feel. Plus point is the lovely vintage looking bikes you can try out and buy. TC, the guy who runs the bicycle boutique is friendly and willing to answer all questions on his bicycles. This is a self service place. You place your order at the counter/cashier and given a buzzer which will notify you when your food is ready. Be prepared to be buzzed a few times as the food does not come out all at once, so a few trips for collection. (Not sure what most of the staff are there for). My friends who smoke love the alfresco sitting area where you can sip your drink, chat and have a puff. Just do help the staff to bring in the empty vessels before leaving. However, I think there is room for improvement for the food. Tried the Beef stew, which I think could do with more flavouring. Heard the burgers are good but yet to try it. When I was there they ran out of beef patties. Do keep a look out for their vintage decor.... there's 2 adorable barber chair...
