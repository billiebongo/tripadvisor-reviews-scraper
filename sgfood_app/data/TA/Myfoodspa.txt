With a bit of hesitation initially, we selected MyFoodSPA catering service for our Kid's birthday party celebration and it turned out to be great choice. We had guests from many different nationalities and literally every person loved the food. The service was excellent too. I highly recommend this place for catering for any party celebrations

Celebrated son's first Birthday Party at at MyFoodSpa located at 103 Syed Alwi Road opposite Mustafa Center. With the exception of the high number stairs that you have to climb to reach the Party Hall everything else at the party was close to perfect. I wish they had a lift to reach the party Hall. On the positive side the Restaurant assisted us in decorating the place to our liking by offering one helper. Food offered was buffet style. The food quaility was not exceptional but considering the price it was value for money. Since their central kitchen is just downstairs, the food served was fresh and hot. The Party hall is just perfect for around 45 guest, if you have more people attending the party you may want to look elsewhere as the hall is not too big. The best part was that we did not had to perform the cleaning after the party guest left
