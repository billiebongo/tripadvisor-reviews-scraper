Knead to Eat has been my preferred place for lunch for the last two years.
Food is always great and the staff is always smiling!
Go try the best sandwich in Singapore!

Great place for sandwiches made fresh and well brewed coffee. Cakes are good too. Service is quick and if you plan early, they also do deliveries.

Busy with business workers at lunchtime. Sandwiches are yummy, try the chicken tikka Marsala and grandma's BLT. Open til 6 pm so going off hours will allow you to get food quickly

Best sandwiches in Singapore hands down. Fresh ingredients and super tasty. The place gets a little too crowded during lunch time though.

I returned here recently this time to try the coffee after having eaten lunch nearby with a colleague. I opted for a cappuccino which wasn't too bad, perhaps just a little milky for my liking. I probably should have paid extra for a double shot. Presentation was good and there are few alternatives in the vicinity if you're looking for a decent coffee

The sandwiches are fresh crisp and good. I always have the Tuna on multigrain loaf. Though I'm not a multigrain fan but after having it there during most of my lunch break,I've begun to love it. Ever tried spicy Beatroot soup? Well, I never but I love theirs. The mushroom soup is not too nice for me cos I find that it has toooo much mushroom pieces. It shd either be properly proportioned betw soup & mushroom. And it has a bitter after taste.in my opinion the mushroom shd be placed in a mixer till fine with slightly more soup then it'll be just right,minus the bitterness. The salad bowl is worth having too...healthy choices of ingredients to select from. I will always head to Knead To Eat during lunch over noodles & rice cos its a healthier choice

Tucked away in Changi BizPark, just opposite Park Avenue Hotel, this small eatery opens at the unusually early hour of 7 am, serving fresh (and aromatic) coffee.The pastries arrive a little later, about 30 mins later, but are also worth waiting for for. Sandwich menu looks extensive and interesting, and plan to be back to try those some day. Despite the early hour, service was friendly and efficient.Still the best place for an early morning caffeine fix, other than Changi Airport or the local kopi tiams

Have been going here for lunch randomly for months now but tried the roast beef sandwich for the first time along with the potato and leek soup today.... absolutely brilliant combo!. The servings are consistently filling and the ingredients are all absolutely fresh. The restaurant is run very professionally and I cannot emphasise the value for money one gets

Knead to Eat is the stand-out place for lunch in this area. The staff are friendly and courteous and always welcome you back with a smile, remembering what you like and how you like it. The sandwiches are great, loaded full of delicious fresh ingredients and the coffee is some of the best I have had in Singapore in six years
