The team at South Union Park are doing a perfect job as your local neighbourhood restaurant with comforting food, reasonable prices and friendly service. Every visit has been consistently great and we come back again and again.

Came twice. Once for desserts and once for mains. I’m ok to pay that price if the food were good. Food is on the sweet side and too rich. The meats didn’t taste fresh and coffee was too acidic.

Was pleasantly surprised to find this wonderful bistro in the quiet neighbourhood in Kembangan.
Food was good and well-priced.
Went for a 2nd visit within a month.
Worth the trip.

Had the beef ragu which was well balanced. Pasta was just undercooked and still had a white line in the middle. Although some might consider this al dente, it was rather chewy for me.

Tuck away in the quietest corner of Singapore. This restaurant menu appears to be small and priced medium high. Run by group of young employees, we were abit skeptic even after hearing rave reviews. But after the food arrives, we were blown. The corn chowder was divine and the barramundi was insane. Out of curiosity, we ask for the manager to have a chat. The owner arrives and explain the he was train under 3 of the Worlds top 50 Restuarants. (You can ask him yourself when u meet Home) He doesn’t want his diner to be high end so that everyone can enjoy quality without the hefty price tag or serious dining environment. Kudos and totally worth sharing something this local only Ge

Really great food and service. We had the flat iron steak, prawn risotto, pork schnitzel and fennel sausage pasta for our mains - and every one of these dishes was awesome. The brownie with salted caramel ice cream was heavenly. It’s a little noisy on a Friday evening but that’s probably expected.

Duck Confit Tagliatelle with Sautéed Spinach, Hazelnut Cream ($22)Pasta was done perfectly, same goes for the duck. The Hazelnut Cream is quite heavy (might feel jelat), but one thing for sure is that this was way too salty for my liking. Really such mixed feelings cos I loved everything about it except the sauce.Short Rib Cavatelli in Tomato Ragu ($24)LOVED THIS! The beef was tender & delightful, the ragu was hearty & comforting. Cavatelli is not everyone's cup of tea- it may seem strange to people who are used to the more common pasta forms. But am quite the carb-lover, so I loved it. It does not look like much, but it will fill you up because it is quite dense. #carbsftwLatte ($4.50) was decent. Overall, would return here.  Cash or NETS only No service charge or GST WiFi availabl

My family and I were delighted with a new food option in this area, so we looked forward to something refreshing when we visited for dinner.Service was prompt and friendly. However, the food options were not many, were a bit unusual and rather expensive for the area but we were game. Only the soup was good and the crab-cake was above average but the other 5 dishes were definitely not "wow", actually closer to "meh". For what we paid for dinner, we have had much, much better food than these at the same or cheaper prices elsewhere.Definitely not returning again

I think this is the best food I have had in a Singapore cafe in a while. I have been to South Union Park a few times, and tried a number of different dishes. I've never been disappointed. The food here is good, and cooked with a lot of heart. It's wonderful to find a place where the chef and crew takes such pride in their food. The service staff are knowledgeable, make good recommendations, and always serve with a smile. Terence, the chef-owner, had chatted with us on our first visit, and shared with us his vision for the joint and his commitment to making everything from scratch. Always looking forward to visiting again

Tucked into a quiet corner of Singapore, this restaurant is run by a graduate from the Culinary Institute or America. The titles on the menu sound familiar but when served, it is pleasantly different from the usual and the portions are just right so you can go the whole hog and have all 3 courses including dessert. Another made-in-Singapore company to be proud of
