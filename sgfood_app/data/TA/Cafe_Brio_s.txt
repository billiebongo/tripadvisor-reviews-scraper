Excellent lunch buffet with wide variety of choices. Very popular with families especially on weekends.

Delicious food.love their cakes.would be better if their cake serve in bigger sizeðŸ˜… seem we must make reservation before we eat there.lucky we still got a table because we didnt have plan to eat there before. Just saw it when we walked in that area

Accidentally ate in this cafe. We saw the buffet word on their info board & decided to try it. Difficult got a table because it very crowded. Their food taste delicious especially their cakes. Super yummy. I ate lot of cakes on that dayðŸ˜…

A shame to renovate to an A la Minute style serving at breakfast yet not meet standards...poor staffing and disorganised place.
Noisy with tour groups focus.
5
Good spread. Good service. Friendly staff. Will come again. Interesting concept. Nice decor. Friendly
4
I ordered the Super Laksa from the a la carte menu. The serving was huge as it came with lobster, scallops, prawns, fishcake and beansprouts with chili served on the side. The soup was aromatic, creamy and every spoonful was delightful. I am competely satisfied with this dish
5
My last visit was March, since then the hotel lobby has been made over into a pretty cool space. Originally the Italian restaurant was on the second floor and was good but sort of lost and not too visible. That has changed as it is now within Cafe Brio, really tasty food, I think it's better value now and pretty good service. Will certainly visit again during this trip, pasta was gorgeous and just the right amount, try it out
4
Cafe Brio's is no more and has been replaced by Food Capital, with a complete face-lift. I have good memories of Care Brio's and particularly liked the water feature, although I would agree that that took up potential seating space. While its name may conjure mix reactions, I ate at Food Capital recently and it was great! More than made up for the name
5
The food was fantastic!!! Wide spread of choices and freshly served. The staff at all the food stations were nice and friendly most important they GREET & SMILE! I would like to thank Chef David Toh for removing the black chicken from the soup so I can enjoy it. I was telling my friend that I like to have the soup but the sight of the black chicken makes me feel lousy. I believe Chef David has overheard my conversation and he brought me 2 bowls of soup without the black chicken. He went the extra mile to ensure I have an opportunity to drink the soup and enjoy my food. He really is a GREAT chef and his attentiveness is all you need to make a guest happy. This is my second visit to Food Capital since opening. I will definitely come back and recommend to my family and friends as long as the food is good

This place was pretty good in 2014 and it has gone down hill - the quality is mediocre and the price is very high. The buffet has things that are not fresh and the quality of various dishes is comparable to a sizzler in the USA but the prices are out of line. I guess the hotel has a captive audience
4
CafÃ© Brio has good Variety of food and quick service. They offer mix of continental and Asian - Chinese, Indian items. also have some customized items of your choices
3
good breakfast buffet which can be very busy. Selections are European and Asian. Atmosphere so/so. Convenient and quick. Options available in neighborhood if you don't want to stay in hotel.
5
We had dinner in Brio's and the buffet included a huge array of choice, and choosing what to eat from the range available was very tricky! Incredibly good!
3
You'll find Brio in the lobby of the Copthorne Hotel. The buffet offers a mix of cuisines. Great if you like oysters and prawns or sushi. Not overly impressed with the selection of mains and you only get satay at the weekends.
3
Located inside the Grand Copthorne Waterfront hotel at Singapore River. You can also dine outside at the riverside.
A bit slow serving I experienced - but in otherwise OK.
Food OK - but not anything special. They also have an evening buffet.
2
I first went to this Cafe Brio's buffer dinner in May 2014, and it was amazingly good and value for money, especially it has the 30% discount using some Credit Card, and the best part is they serve you free flow of Lobster (or Crayfish), which is nice (see my photo taken in 2015).Revisited this restaurant last Sunday (27 Mar 16) and realise it has moved to 2nd floor due to some renovation work below, and the quality of food and variety has been dropped significantly, and definitely not worth the price even with the Credit Card discount Promotion
2
For two days in a row I had breakfast here as the main breakfast venue of my hotel was under refurbishment. Poor selections of everything, less table and seats respect the number of guest they knew they will have breakfast. And the venue is not so clean. Bad one
5
Cafe Brios is quite well known to have one of the best hotel buffets around. Yes, there are a couple of better ones, but they aren't at all value for money. That's why Brios ranks more highly for me. Brios offers a very good spread of local and international cuisine. I especially love the Chinese style black pepper beef and the Indian style mutton. They're mouthwatering delicious and super tender
2
Probably the worst hotel breakfast i have had in a while.Food was terrible except of the egg station. Cold cuts disgusting and look old, indian food so so, japanese section is ridiculous and they should skip anyways as they don't have many japanese hotel guests.Service was disastrous, no coffee cups, hot water for tea was out etc...Paid 35 dollar each or 82 all in for two and wished I would have walked to starbucks in great world city instead, even for just to have a lousy croissant an overpriced latte
3
Most larger hotels in Singapore have a place like this for breakfast that serves buffet lunches and dinners. The 5 star ones have 5 star prices and usually have good stuff at a price. The 3 star ones tend to have mediocre spreads that are really not worth looking at. Grand Copthorne Waterfront is in between. Their weekday lunch buffet, even though targeted at their many conference events, is actually quite decent, even though their charcoal satay and teh tarik were notably absent this time around. Highlights are - good sashimi served from a counter (so you don't get customers messing it up, good read meats (they had very nice roast lamb and beef during this visit). The rest was pretty uninteresting and pretty average.Service was good enough
2
Food very average. No healthy options for kids, just fast food. Service was ok, although sometimes was hard to get waiter's attention because they do not keep an eye contact with customers.
5
Great for buffet breakfast and a la cartte. we sat outside for dinner overlooking the river. Reasonable prices and good service.
5
The restaurant offers a wide variety of asian food. Food quality is good. Price is average. The atmosphere is very nice. This restaurant also serves very good quality durians.
4
Great lunch buffet at a reasonable price. Average spread of food items. But items are generally of good quality. Seating space can be improved as some tables are too close to one another, making it difficult and awkward for customers to stand up and walk.
5
Good food and good ambience...service was excellent even though we did not eat the buffet. We ordered ala carte...the seafood Hor fun was great. Pity they do not serve mojito...otherwise it would be perfect.

We went for CafÃƒÂ© Brio's BBQ High Tea Buffet today after reading about it from a blog and we ate till we were stuffed!There were sushi and hand rolls but no sashimi, sandwiches, salads, Chinese cold platter (the century eggs are always not there when I want them), nasi lemak, carrot cake (very good), rojak, laksa (ok) and dim sum (siew mai and har kow). But the main attraction was the barbequed food. The chicken satay, chicken wings and sausages were extremely tasty and well-marinated. There was even cuttlefish but it tasted a bit burnt. Desserts were alright but what caught my eye was the durian pudding and muah chee. Good! Overall, a nice high tea for the price of $38++ per person
1
The manager is nice and friendly however the staff were so lazy and unprofessional. When we walked in one of the waitresses was very rude when I asked her for d al a carte restaurant. None of the waiters knew about the soup of the day and were unaware that inhouse guests get 15 percent disc. The food took 45 mins and things were missing. There were two tables that were left dirty from when we walked in till we left. Salmon was so small looked like a kids meal. When we were ready the waitress came rushing with the menu so they can close and leave. They never smile!
4
Owing to SG50 weekend, booking via phone was almost impossible. Internet booking via Chope was a breeze. Better book early ahead of any crowd. You need to marinate the sea-food before sending to the BBQ guys, otherwise its cooked plain. Best for families with little kids - under 5 eat for free
3
Arriving quite late into Singapore I chose to stay in hotel and eat at Cafe Brio's. The buffet was unappealing with sticker shock price of $72. The wait staff were excellent and very attentive, the a le carte selection I made was very tasty. I was able to fill up for $50. Cafe Brios is also breakfast venue for the hotel, and again very pricey
4
It's in the Grand Copthorne Waterfront Hotel in Singapore. We had the lunch buffet and it was a business lunch. Good selection of dishes - Japanese, Local and Western. Items were fresh and regularly replenished - not cooked in large portions and left to sit. Carving stations for roast meats and sashimi. Generous portions. Nice desserts - reasonable variety of Western and Local delights. Quality food and attentive service. Good for business entertainment as tables were not too close to each other depriving you of privacy. Suggest reservations and they seem to be doing well
5
Don't worry about not being catered for, it's already there. $35 for the buffet is the way to go. It's only $5 more the American and infinitely better.
5
Stayed here a few nights Sept 2014 forgot to do a review . wonderful International selection. excellent service and atmosphere very busy but well looked after going back in March 2015 for a nother few days and look forward to eating here again
1
We went there for dinner yesterday, and both my wife and I agreed it was probably our worst buffet experience EVER. We had decided to go out for a buffet dinner somewhere and Parkroyal at Pickering was full and since Brio was nearby and reviews were decent, we decided to give it a go, BIG MISTAKE. First up, the sashimi wasn't fresh, the oysters kept disappearing and staff too forever to replenish. The roast pork looked great but was obviously made from frozen pork as the meat wasn't sweet and was pretty much tasteless. The chilli crab tasted like crab with some tangy sauce nothing at all like any chilli crab I have ever eaten and I have eaten over a dozen different variations. The only dish that was any good was the pork chop. The dessert selection was pathetic, you would get a better selection at Starbucks. We paid S$63.88 per pax but I would have hesitated paying even S$25 per pax, it was that bad. Then when we paid the bill, the waiter said the Citibank card discount was not applicable, even though it was clearly stated in the hotel website it WAS, despite the fact it was a public holiday, but I didn't want to argue, just wanted to get out of there. Yes, it is expensive to eat out in singapore, but most times you get quality for what you pay for, but this was just a waste of time, money, and my precious calories. If you want to eat a bad buffet, go to the buffet chains, at least you won't get charged 63.88 but more like 23.88.

This was a Valentines buffet.... but there wasn't a trace of valentines dÃ©cor-- plenty of goats and dragons for lunar new year- we have put these decorations up and we cant be bothered taking them down again so.. Symptomatic of a general we canâ€™t be bothered attitude.Firstly when directing you to a table they tell you the price- no hope of keeping that a secret then.Then tell you that one glass of a dreadful Prosecco is included and if you want more its $15 per glass- frankly at $15 a bottle it would have been over priced!I asked for a wine list - it didn't come. then a server asked me if we wanted something to drink and I repeated my requested. He was baffled and then said 'You mean drinking menu?"Congratulations for the smallest wine list I have ever seen in an International hotel. I selected a Californian merlot. The fairly useless senior server( a female) brought tiny glasses and then attempted to open the bottle at the table. Ten minutes later and having sought the help of others she produced a bottle with a fragmented cork which still wasn't openI was obliged to remove the cork as the staff were unable to do so - but then found that the previous hacking had caused most of the cork pieces had gone inside the wine. She expected me to drink this and was most put out when I declined.A very pleasant Indian gentleman then arrived bearing 3 alternatives only one being a Merlot - well hey they were red so that's good enough!!The only Merlot was a pretty dreadful New Zealand Merlot, but luckily it had a screw cap. He did bring red wine glasses but had no clue how to pour or stem drips after pouring.The buffet was mediocre at best. the oysters and prawns were good. The sashimi was hacked and cut against the grain. the server although dressed in some Japanese outfit had no clue and simply tossed the food at you. The beef carvery was overcooked and similarly hacked by a youth disguised as a carvery chef.The Salmon encroute was dreadful. The remaining fare as stated was decidedly mediocre.The desserts were simply awful.When the bill came the NZ merlot which was $20 cheaper had been charged at the Californian price. When I pointed this out they initially explained by telling me they had given it me for the same price !! Lucky me.The staff on arrival were everywhere but dwindled to non-existent. Getting the bill was difficult as the staff were all chit chatting at the arrival desk.An experience I wouldn't repeat
2
Food is good, selection fair but service is where we had a huge problem.Asked for a bottle of white of the menu, first she asked for a manager then he brought red opened it and walked off.Asked nicely for our white 40mins later man come back with a another red...... Shambles.A real shame as its a cheap budget buffet with great food

I remember once the CafÃ© Brio's had an excellent Sunday brunch offering. This was several years ago. We went back with the family and knew the famous Sunday brunch is not offered anymore but we wanted to try what is left on Sunday, which means the normal buffet.How disappointing! Maybe it is in line with the price paid (less than 50SGD) but it was not even good. Only the fresh sashimi were ok.Choice on the main course is unacceptable. The mini hamburgers and other dishes have not even been eaten by my children. No meat on offer. This will just be the last time for us.
4
Cafe Brio's is located at the lobby level of Grand Copthorne Waterfront Hotel, a distinctive cafe with a lovely piano and clean-cut counters offering international buffet with a heavy Asian touch to it.If one prefers, they could choose to sit outdoors and dine alfresco by the river and enjoy some breezes caressing their faces over their meals. It looks more electrifying at night, but we were there for breakfast / brunch - served between 6.30am - 10.30am daily.The spread was rather wide - ranging from the usual breakfasty stuff such as pancakes, yogurt, assortment of pastries, crispy bacon, hash brown , ham and cereal etc. The pastries were crispy and fluffy - fresh, and tasty.Then there were fruits, congee with ingredients on the side, eggs, baked beans, array of juices and some noodles. We had a rather balanced brunch, I must say.The food was good, and the music was soothing. The service crew was rather courteous, hence it made the dining experience awesome.Breakfast pricing per pax is SGD$23.00 for Continental delights and SGD$30.00 for American - go for the latter, there's more variety.For full review and more photographs, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/12/buffet-breakfast-at-cafe-brios-grand.htm

My family and I attended Christmas brunch at Brio's and the lead up to the event was well managed by the F&B Manager of the hotel. The food which we required was difficult and outside the traditional Christmas lunch, been vegetarian/gluten free which was taken under their wing and was very much appreciated by us especially in light of the large demand which the buffet would have had on the chef's. The early bird booking discount of 20% was also great to receive on payment of the lunch.The lunch consisted of a broad range of local delights, BBQ, and traditional ham and turkey and condiments. The free flow Moet was also really good touch for the drinkers at our table. We had a nice table by the window put of the way of the main traffic to the buffet. This was a nice bright location. Completely different to the dark and mood lighting we had one year at the Hyatt for a much greater price. We would return here again over the Hyatt.Really very nice staff even upon arrival at the front door we were greeted by smiling faces and welcoming staff
4
A giant 15 feet Christmas Tree greeted me when I stepped into the lobby. Making a detour around it, I spotted a familiar figure--Mr Santa--resting happily in the goodie house and surrounded by his old friends, Mr and Mrs Gingerbread Men. The cheery festive spirits at Grand Waterfront Copthorne Waterfront were highly infectious and they definitely pumped up my appetite to indulge in the Yuletide treats at Cafe Brio's. I summed up FIVE REASONS why this is a great location to wine, dine and be merry! For full review visit user's blog under profil

Had a business meeting over the lunch buffet.A great selection of fresh and tasty food. The sashimi was delicious. A wide selection of hot dishes as well as nice salads. My colleagues had the laksa and said that it was very good. Overall a good choice for lunch
5
Service was simply excellent, and the buffet dinner covers a wide variety of foods, amongst which Laksa and king crabs are my favourite that draw me back to CafÃ© Brio.
3
it's something special as there is spanish theme buffet at cafe brio's at that night. so at least we could try spanish suckling pig which is nice. dessert is terribly less than other cafes and never top up on finished items.
2
The buffet selection does not really match the price of $48++. I think that they can give more varieties otherwise i may not want to bring my guests there again..
2
Food - avg
Service - none
Feedback given, no follow up by management. Suppose to call but nv rec any
1
Awful, overpriced, poor poor service, lack of availability on menu, wrong food arrived, never again. There are way too many other places to eat in Singapore, take a taxi and explore, or take a walk across the river to the restaurants there instead.
4
Went there with my colleagues. Enjoyed the ambiance, food and service. Wish there were more desserts though. However, the sushi and lamb are highly commendable!
4
We had their Christmas special buffet lunch and the food form the live stations were absolutely delicious! Can't say the same for the soups, but we'd given feedback and hopefully they will review them. Seafood was fresh and sweet. Service staff was impressive. I haven't experienced such excellent service in quite a while! That definitely made our lunch
4
For me and my family the selling point here are the fresh oysters, sashimi and seafood. We are always amazed at how quickly they replenish the oysters since they can only lay out that many each time to make sure the oysters remain nicely chilled and fresh. My son had more than 15 oysters on one occasion and didn't have the slightest tummy upset. Yes that's how much we love them! Weekend buffets also include a decent spread of BBQ meats and seafood at the alfresco area just beside the cafÃƒÂ©. While the other items on the menu (eg. laksa, roast beef, chilli crab, salads, cheese, sushi, curries, soups etc) and the desserts may not be anything to shout about, I've found them to always be adequate and of very reasonable quality. Yes the buffet price may be on the higher side but half a dozen oysters can set you back SGD20 and upwards when ordered al a carte in a restaurant. I'd recommend Cafe Brio's for those who enjoy oysters, sashimi and seafood. Those who don't enjoy these may find their money better spent elsewhere
3
The food at cafe Brio seem promising in terms of variety (snow crab, sashimi -3 types, tempura and other Jap far besides the BBQ grills, a selction of salads and the usual cooked dishes (western & Asian), but the quality was really just mediocre. When the pricing ($80/- with taxes added) was taken into consideration, I personally felt was really not worth it
2
Was there on a weekend dinner. Food was ok, place was very crowded. 6 of us was seated at a table which I feel was good enough for maximum 4.Although we had made reservations before going, it was disappointing to see such a small table for 6 of us. We were almost knocking on each other's elbows and there was not much space to put our plates and glasses.Food was ok, not a single dish seems worth a second round or can be named as a signature dish for the restuarant. It was very slow in replenishment. Example, I asked them to replenish the ice-cream as it was totally empty. It was not done even after I have requested 3 times over 30 mins. I finally got my ice-cream by complaining to the restuarant manager. He went to the kitchen, brought me 3 scoops of vanilla ice-cream. When I have finished the 3 scoops, the ice-cream at the buffet table was since not replenished. Top up of water was slow too. The only excuse was that it was quite full on a sunday dinner.Service was totally not accepted for a millennium group hotel restuarant. I went to the sushi counter, there was nobody there, after waiting for 5 mins, the service staff came. I ordered some salmon and asked if they have pacific clams, to my surprise, the staff asked if I can speak chinese. I think this is not accepted for an internationally well known hotel.Clearing of the empty/used plates was so slow that we gathered them and placed them to the used dish area ourselves.At the end of dinner, we waited 30 mins for the bill to come and ended up going to the cashier to get it instead.Will never return to this resturant, for this price, you get much better standard of food and service elsewhere
3
Only used it for breakfast and it was pretty average. Nothing memorable, and if you don't have them freshly cooked, the fried eggs are pretty solid.
3
Had the lunch buffet. Good sashimi and cooked seafood. Meat carving station was OK, but not topnotch. Limited dessert selection. Lunch for one person, without drinks, was $75.
5
We had the fillet steak and rack of lamb. Both brilliant and cooked as we requested. Went back the next night it was that good. The seafood buffet looked awesome but couldn't eat enough to justify the price.
1
no service, and then they get it wrong. Staff push in fromt of you and banging and cracking of plates - and staff who would rather rub their nose than look at you.
5
Lunch buffet was great, variety of Indonesian, Singapore, Malay and Indian food. Room service was quick and the food was great too,
4
It was a Sunday and the restaurant was full. Despite the crowd, the staff still gave enough attention to us in terms of refilling water and clearing used plates. Had quite a variety of choices and barbecue food tasted good. Replenish of popular food like fresh oysters and sashimi a bit slow. Overall, a great experience for family dining
5
even the restaurant was full of guest fighting for the buffet i go for a la card and it was a nice choice. I ordered rib eye steak and it was wonderful. They ask me to wait 30 mins due to overloading of guests due to sea food buffet but it came after 15 mins and the steak was great as well as the french fries, best in decade 
4
This is my third time dinning here. Had dinner on a weekday with my colleaguesPros- Quite good selection. - Food - I love the sashimi (had a few servings), prawns (quite fresh), crabs, chili crabs, buns (goes very well with the chili crab sauce), lamb (with sauce and mustard), crab salad, laksa, fried chicken, etc. - Dessert - Pretty decent. A few selection of cakes, local dessert (layered cake, kuih, a few soup dessert, etc), chocolate fountain (fondue) and ice cream- Coffee and tea is free (Self service). - Ambience - Lovely ambience and loads of space at the buffet counter as well as the tables are not close to each other. I prefer indoor due to the humid SG weather, but outdoor serves a "river" view. I went with my 11 other colleagues and we were comfortable seated.Cons- Service is pretty slow here. I think it's due to lack of staff.- Location. The nearest MRT station to this hotel is Outram (20-30mins walk). Overall - I like the food and I dont mind dinning here again.Tip - If you are coming here by cab/taxi, remember to emphasize the word "Grand" (Grand Copthorne Waterfront Hotel), as there is another hotel nearby which have quite a similar name.If you think my review is helpful, please let me know by clicking the helpful vote :) Thank yo

Tried their Seafood Experience which charges a little more that their usual. They advertise it with a picture of a lobster holding an oyster. Misleading, as found neither at the lunch on a public holiday. I suppose they are being reserved for dinner. Stingy with the sashimi, which you had to queue up for, to get served measly servings each time. Makes you feel like you're begging for scraps. If not for us being in their loyalty programme which entitles one to some discounts, we probably won't consider it.Having said that, the seafood was fresh, the dishes tasty
3
I love desserts.. Unfortunately, the desserts had one hit and many misses. Variety of food was not there though they had some local delights like laksa. That was nice. But it did not really make up for the lack of variety of fresh seafood. Will not visit again
1
My 1st meal in Singapore since I last visited years ago. Pure disappointment. Food lousy, bad service, horrible price!
3
You know exactly where which item of the buffet spread is after 2visits, and its a reasonably large spread, but the exact same stuff.
5
Very good weekend international dinner buffet. I wish they gave free refills on coffee. I drank my coffee before the meal arrived and could not bring myself to pay for another one. There more expensive than Starbucks.
3
We had dinner here one night and the fillet steak I ordered was well done instead of medium and the salmon of my wife was dry and well cooked through. Not good enough in a hotel this size.
4
good service but menu could offer more variety, but food quality was good. worth eating here at least you know u getting top service.
3
I and my family had a lunch there. The food is average and the service is not like what to be expected for a restaurant in 5 starred hotel as it is. My daughter ordered a hamburger steak; the meat was a bit burnt that it formed charcoal here and there. My other daughter ordered fish and chips. And the tartar sauce was served after she took several bites; which was almost more than 5 minutes later after the dish was served earlier. Same case with my order. The sambal for my kwee tio came several minutes after my order placed in front of me and I had taken a few spoonfuls. And the waiters/waitres who put the food on our tables were not elegant and a bit rough. They didn't speak English well too. The prices? They were just as expected when you dined in a 5 starred hotels. But minus the services.We won't come back again

Cafe Brio is located at Grand Corpthorne Waterfront Hotel. In month of July, i visited this cafe for their international buffet dinner. A good and wide choice of foods. Delicious local foods like Laksa, Mee Siam, char kwey tiao, chicken rice, satay, roti prata and not to be missed tasty durians and mangosteen. Beside local foods, they have seasfoods, sushi, etc. Dessertslike nonya kueh, ah ballings, soya bean curd, etc
4
Ambience - Typical buffet restaurant. Bright lights, water features and adequate sitting space and distance between each table. Food spread - A good international spread. Local delights like roti prata (the curry is good), laksa (thumbs up from all my colleagues who tried it), fried carrot cake (a personal favourite), Lor Mee (sauce was surprisingly light yet delicious) and rojak. Not forgetting the typical salad counter, appetizers, seafood counter (oyster was fresh), sashimi (sad that there was no Tuna/Maguro), soup (the cream of carrot got a thumbs up from me), cheese spread and deserts. There is the topical fruits spread and even durian for those who love it. Overall, the food got a 4/5 from me. Service - The staff was prompt in clearing the plates throughout the night as we dined. Smiley and courteous. The refilling of the water glasses was prompt too.Cost - no idea as it was a company dinner. My duty there was to eat and be friendly with everyone. LOL...Overall - I will recommend the place for those looking for a good spread of local and international delights. May not be as authentic as the originals but it is still a good place to start

This is a hotel cafe/restaurant of Grand Copthorne Waterfront and is a bit atypical. Breakfast is additional if you're a guest, it's generous enough, coffee only so-so. We ate here one night, mistake, cocktails were over-iced, the staff weren't able to explain the nuances of the drinks or food menus. For a short 5 minute walk across the river there are more interesting restauants with loads of character on offer
3
Food replenishment is slow and buffet food always run out, apart from that the buffet is not well kept. Coffee tasted watery without flavor to kick up your mood in the early morning. Service was moderate well, look like understaffed. Bacon too dry, muslie taste funny and not fresh. Local food like chay kueh tow is not bad. Overall not a good buffet cafe. Only consolidationis that outdoor have good view by the river
3
A Decent Breakfast, with a variety range of food to choose from. Staffs was friendly and food is average. there's nothing more or less to comments about a decent small bistro.
4
breakfast buffet has a wide selection of breads, though more variety of fruits would have been great. Rest of the selections are much more than breakfast in western part of the world. Dinner buffet is equally sumptuous!
5
We had our breakfasts here plus 2 evening dinners. We chose the buffet, so much variety and real good fresh food
4
The atmosphere next to the river makes it enjoyable. It could be uncomfortable on an extremely humid day, but the river just makes it a pleaseant & refreshing outlook.
5
One of the reasons I stay here is fantastic breakfast, one is spoilt for choice what to eat and flawless service. One of the highlight of the day to have a drawn out breakfast with lots of good coffee!!!
3
Totally buffet.Ok for breakfast and perhaps lunch but only a short walk to better restaurants on other side of river for dinner.
3
Leans more towards a cafeteria than a restaurant. The vast majority of people who dine here appear to have little manners, will push in front of you at the buffet, dress as if they are going to the beech and only seem to eat the more expensive items such as oysters, crab, sashimi etc 80% don't order wine or any drinks other than the free water. Good effort from the hotel and kitchen staff only to be wasted and let down by the clientele.

Visited for lunch buffet on a weekday. The crowd is good, not too packed so we have a good space for our group. It was holding the seafood event when we visited so there were quite a few fish and seafood dish. The quality of food is good and the prawns were fresh and best of all, de-shelled (except for the cold entries). The sashimi counter was managed by a chef who will slice the fresh fish upon order. There were good range of salad too.However, I find the variety is lacking. I would have appreciated more choices of the cooked food as well as the dessert. Nevertheless, there are variety of local kueh which is a nice thing to have considering most buffet comes with only western cakes. Service was very good with staff there being attentive and table was cleared promptly. I had requested for fruit juice which was done well and met my requests (i.e. the fruit mix, less ice, etc.). For the price paid though, I would not rank it as affordable. But do check on the available card promotion which may give savings up to 25%

Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â TripAdvisor ReviewIs it the sorry state of the hotel industry that there is a labour shortage, or is quality service sorely lacking in hospitality professionals?After being shown to my seat, I would have expected to be askedÂ Â if I would like to order a drink. It was unfortunately not apparent to the team member that a drink was needed. It was 7 minutes after sitting that I had to ask the same team member for a glass of water, when it should have been offered as soon as I sat!It was another 5 minutes before I was offered a glass of water and asked if I wanted to order a drink.Â The ambience of the restaurant was nice enough but while I understand the need to maximize tables, they were a little too close for comfort as there is always a perpetual danger of knocking into a neighboring table.The food was another thing altogether. The buffet spread was a sumptuous smorgasbord so varied that I was at a loss as to how I should start off my meal. The selection, leaning towards Indian cuisine; Â was nothing short of amazing.Â Kudos to the Executive Chef and his culinary team, so all is not lost

Spread was good - there is the requisite array of food you expect from an international buffet. Sushi//sashimi, teppanyaki counter, chilled seafood (even oysters and Alaskan king crab legs), local nonya dishes, the obligatory Indian dishes, soups, salad bar that none of the value-for-my-money-why-I-pay-so-much-to-eat-veg-har singaporeans would touch, dessert, ice-cream and chocolate fondue fountain.Quality of the food was excellent overall - seafood was fresh, teppanyaki was so well-cooked, and some of the desserts (apple crumble) were really excellent. I would rate this one of the better value-for-money buffet places I've been to so far. It really is a good deal compared to the likes of Melt or even The Line. Quality is half a notch below these places but the price is several notches down

Other than the usual seafood, they offer sliced abalone too. Ate here at least 4-5 times in a year. Whether it is a la carte or buffet, breakfast, lunch, tea or dinner is equally yummy.

we ate here when staying at garnd copthorne hotel and the food was very nice, sat outside and the ambience along the river just adds to the experience of the night

A bustling restaurant at peak hours with delicious food and plenty of it!

Super breakfasts to cater for all tastes...we also had tea and cakes one afternoon.....they were nearly too good to eat ! Lovely

Expensive and nothing exciting, standard buffet, ala carte looks the better option

Tucked away in the quiet Duxton hill shops amongst some chi-chi offices, the food is good but not exceptional and the seatings are cramps...so is the toilet. Definitely not for larger sized expats.

Great buffet. Pricey unless during promotion period

We sensed something was wrong the moment we arrived as the restaurant was very empty on a Sunday afternoon. We went there for its famous fresh oysters and sashimi but there was no oysters and limited sashimi. The choices were so limited and thoughtless like prawn noodles, quiche, samosa, pao and siew mai??? It cannot even measure up to some high tea we have been to at about the same price. The waiters and waitresses had also appeared to be lethargic with their service as we have to keep asking for our water to be refilled and our plates to be cleared. Our family was utterly disappointed with the lunch buffet spread on Sunday

This used to be our favourite place to go for buffet..... as the selection was great, especially the cold seafood and roast.... If you went on a Sat night, there's bbq roast also.... When we went for dinner buffet in Oct 2010, the spread of the cold seafood was awesome, there were jumbo prawns, Alaskan king crabs, scallops..... Other times, instead of the Alaskan king crabs, there were crayfish....even for lunch buffet...However, this time round in Dec 2010, it was a huge disappointment!The selection and quality of food was not like it used to be........ No wonder we realised that this time, the place was half empty when it used to be full house last time every single time we went!Read somewhere that there's a change in Executive Chef........ How we wish to know where the old chef had gone to...The selection of the cold seafood was pathetic now, with only oysters and prawns......There was no roast turkey as compared to previous years (Dec buffet), instead it's only turkey breast and my husband commented it was tasteless, so I didn't bother to try....All the other food was also mediocre....I don't think we will be going back to this place for buffet anymore.
