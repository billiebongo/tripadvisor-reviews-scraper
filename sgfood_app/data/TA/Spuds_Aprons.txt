We Went there to celebrate valentine. Order set for 2pax. We enjoy our time there. Will visit there again.

Saw lot of bad comments from Facebook, but the food and services were better than expectations, with a good view.
3
Food was simple and a little overpriced however the view made up for that. Some of the staff were really friendly, but there was one that seemed really rude. location a little out of the way too
4
The food was good, price is reasonable but the service was mediocre. Would have been perfect if service was better. One of the staff which we believe is a part timer was very unsure of certain things and blur as well.
4
Had simple birthday celebration and overall the food and service was not bad. We had indoor seating and staff was kind to allow us borrow outdoor seating to cut the cake after we are done with our payment.
1
had vday dinner at spuds and aprons, staff were overwhelmed with the occasion, paid a bomb for a below average service and food. repeated to the staff >3x to serve the food, apparently the food takes 45mins to arrive. very disappointing experience
5
This place is an excellent place for a romantic date night. Perched on the peak of Mount Faber, it promises to impress your date with the dimly lit atmosphere and causal breeze. This place also provides many opportunities for a good photo will the lock bridge situated right outside the restaurant. Albeit being a bit out of the way, driving here/taking a taxi would solve the problem.
1
This is my second time going here after a walk up Mt Faber, it has a great view from the restaurant but the service is the worst I’ve ever come across. There were about 5 other customers and 4/5 floor staff working, after sitting for 10 minutes, had to ask for a menu. Then when we ordered 2 milkshakes, waited more than 10 minutes for them and when they were ready, we could see them left on the bar for a further 5minutes despite the bell going off to say they were ready. The staff all seem to be rushing around doing nothing and ignoring the customers. Definitely will not be going back again.
2
Disappointing service and food. Kids menu was awful, chips were good. Mains ok but served lukewarm. Bread pudding nothing like bread pudding.
4
Was there on an evening for wedding anniversary dinner with my wife and 5 year old boy. The table we sat at has a fabulous view and my boy was admiring the view more than us throughout the dinner. Ordered a main a side and a kids meal for us as my wife and I were still full from late lunch. Told the manager we tasted sand in our clams and the Chef was notified immediately. Was served complimentary dessert and coffee for the sand in the clams.Overall experience was good
5
Great view and Delicious Food. We had a great time to celebrate our anniversary there. will definitely visit again !! Thanks
3
Business meet up with a client. Overall experience is good but was quite dampen due monsoon season this period.
3
Book 3 weeks in advance for a table asking for a view. In the end, my seats are just the same as those without reservation. The food is good though.
3
The beef gulgogi was not meat, only fat and grissle. However, after I complained, it’s was removed from the bill without question. The remainder of the dish was tasty though.
Great view of Sentosa.
3
Mushroom salad & dressing nice but partners beef was disappointing as pure fat. Service was good and cost of beef dish refunded.
5
Good atmosphere with friendly staff and quite good array of choices on the menu.
I like that there’s minimal waiting time for the food and drinks.
5
The waiting for the food is fast and efficient and service staffs are great and friendly. The place is romantic for couples
3
Nice scenery, good for photographing.
Service was average, only 2 staff working.
Food is normal & overpriced.
4
Amazing views, spacious open dining area. The food was not the highlight, however the Singapore Slings were very tasty!
4
Surprising that this restaurant had a very reasonably priced lunch set. I knew about the a la carte menu and been here for drinks before. Food is quite good but the drinks can be pricey but then again if you are here for cocktails with a view, then I suppose the price is average.I think the Western dishes are better like the cod chicken. The laksa was too "lemak" and lacked the spices one associates with a good laksa - like Asian basil leaves, though it was not bad.It's a good place to end for drinks or a meal at the end of your walk from the Southern Ridges to Mt Faber! And you can even walk to Harbour Front and Vivo City in 8mins if you want to continue your day to chill
4
Nice scenic view at Faber Peak. Enjoying great food and good service. Dine in and get free valet parking.
4
Nice environment and view from top of Mount Faber. Reasonable price and nice food. Good service from the server. Free valet for dinner spending more than $80. Got indoor and outdoor seating.
5
Me and my partner had our first dinner date at the old Jewel Box many many years ago. Even though the place had since re-branded, the romantic ambiance, the skyline harbor front view and the good food remained very much the same as we remembered.
5
Greeted by the server and brought to our seats and the view is amazing. The server that took our order explain what we need to know (promotions, discounts and good recommendations)
5
My wife and I love coming to Spuds and Aprons for drinks and food at sunset. Relaxing spot at the top of Mount Faber Peak.
1
Probably the worst experience I have ever had in my life. So I came solo, and I guess the staff immediately assumed that I won’t spend much money so they didn’t even bother to treat me with respect. I asked for a table with a view, basically 50 or even more percent of the tables were free, and they told me that they are reserves (highly doubt that). They put me somewhere in the middle. When I wanted to order nobody even bother to came. They just looked at me and continued cleaning tables or doing other stuff.Finally I ask “can I order?” And the staff member didn’t reply and went somewhere.This is my first experience of such a terrible staff. Truly dissapointed..
3
Given there was so many eating places on the island we unfortunately chose the one that was quite average in their offerings .The chicken wings were huge deep fried which was not a pleasant sight.The view from this place was good on Fabre mountain
4
The view was really good and staff was okay with letting us change seat to get a better view, food was okay, but the spaghetti was the bomb, I had carbonara. But they should have live band or smth to create a better atmosphere, or have bus that can fetch customers to the faber peak
4
I reserved this place asking for a table with good view and they gave me one right by the edge of the restaurant, overlooking Sentosa. The food was pretty good too, we ordered ribs and oven baked chicken. The smoothies are also worth ordering. This is our second time here and it won't be our last
4
I've been to this restaurants many times in the past years. It is located on the top of the highest mountain of Singapore, mount Fabre. Location of this restaurant is a good and bad thing at the same time as on the one hand it has beautiful views on Sentosa island and Reflections, on the other hand it's not easy to get here or out of here if you don't own a car. In this case, you only have options of taxi or cable car. I like to come here by cable car from Sentosa Island, but it's the matter of choice. If you have an Islander Card (you can buy it on Sentosa), you can get 20% discount on everything, which is worthful as the prices are quite high. The last few visits I was a bit disappointed with the service as it took eternity even the place was not really packed. Overall, nice place with romantic atmosphere and pretty good cuisine.
4
The experience is good for family and couple, good for hosting oversea friends as they get to eat with a city view
3
Excellent food, great atmosphere. However, food took too long to arrive at table. Waited for over 25 mins for a pre-ordered dessert to arrive. Even had to inform the waiter twice!
4
Staff very nice and helpful and nice. Good also very nice. Will visit the place again. Hope to see more promo
1
The baby back ribs was stale and hard, and the fries were soggy. Overall, we felt that the food was subpar and could have been executed better. The outdoor vibes were good but the indoor setting was miserable. Overall, it had been a disappointing visit.
5
Made an advanced reservation to celebrate birthday there. Without any disappointment, the staff helped to bring out the birthday surprise, setting up the cakes and dessert! Thank you!
5
I always dine at Spuds and Aprons whenever I travelled to SG. I was fancied by the marvellous sunset view as well as the nice food and service offered. This time, unfortunately had been raining the whole day and we were worried about the anticipated view. However, the excellent food and service still cherished us and my parents who were not a fan of western food also were fancied by what had been served. I am very happy that I picked Spuds and Aprons to celebrate Daddy's birthday. I will definitely come again when I return to SG next year
5
Restaurant offers superb view of the harbour front looking towards Sentosa Island. Great hangout place with friends. Good spread of food options, nice beers and friendly servers. Reservation allowed. We were in the restaurant (the Faberâ€™s peak) the evening with lightnings and heavy rainfall, was pretty cool but safe to watch the flashing lights
1
2 rats running around next to our dinning table with my oversea guests. The waiter said the place is located on the hill top where they can't control the rats. He suggested, we can shift to other table if we want. I can't image how the food was handled and stored in kitchen. Perhaps, NEA should conduct an inspection and see how the rats issue can be resolved
4
The location has a good view, looking down from Faber Peak. Not so convenient if you don't drive, especially if you come for dinner, it would be very difficult to find the way down Mount Faber to Harbour Front because there are no lighting along the trail. The food definitely has a strong local flavour, with coconut milk as the base for the signature dish Lobster Ba La La La, but it does taste like normal laksa dish which you can get with $5. Overall it is a good place for friends gathering and casual dining.
5
This was my second time back at Spuds and Aprons. Absolutely love this place. Food is amazing. My personal favorite is Ba Ba Licious, the meat is cooked just the way I wanted it. Plus, the ambiance is great, its very casual and chilled. Love the views as well. Would definitely recommend this place! Love it
4
Nice view. Good service. Generous portion of food. Good taste. Good for family gathering or special occasions
4
Brought my family for an anniversary dinner and we enjoyed the yummy food that came with the a spectacular view overseeing Sentosa area and beyond.
3
OVERALL GOOD. Nice environment, good service, good view, romantic, pricey also NOT REACHABLE BY PUBLIC TRANSPORT,
4
Wonderful place to view the sunset and catch the lights of Keppel Bay andSentosa . Good place to chill and have some beers on the alfresco terrace with family and friends. Didn’t stay on for dinner.
4
The lights were quite dim, like eating in the dark.
Food was good.
Staff was friendly.
Their menu states last order at 10pm but the combo last order is at 9.30pm(which was not stated).
3
The ambience was romantic, the service was efficient but the food was mediocre. The spare ribs was dry as if it was a left over from lunch and was just reheated. The happy chicken wings were plain fried chicken, no unique flavour whatsoever.
4
The cable car ride up toMt Faber and drinks & Dinner at Spuds & Aprons was a real treat. The staff could not be more happy & friendly and only too willing to assist in any way to make sure we enjoyed our experience. The whole experience was one we will remember as a highlight of our trip to Singapore
3
The ambience was good with an unblocked view of Sentosa n cable cars. The kids love the koi pond and the space there for them to play n run around. Foods are disappointing though. Lack favours n texture. The portions are big for sharing. Appetisers are nicer than the mains. Recommend for ambience, truffle fries n rounds of beer! Cheers
3
Great spot to sit and relax with a great view. Friendly and efficient staff bring an array of cool drinks, cocktails, beer and hot Drinks as well. While I can't vouch for the whole menu, I found my "Jump Start" pumpkin salad pretty uninteresting. While it read well, didn't live up to expectations. Boiled not roasted pumpkin, asparagus consisted of a few skinny stems, no spears, I'm not sure it was even asparagus, bland tomato chunks and the orange segments - simply didn't go. However after walking the Southern Ridge walk it was a pleasant place to chill for a while. Ice cream desserts do however, look pretty good
4
We took our children to Spuds and Aprons to have dinner as it was one of the kids' birthday. The ambience was nice as we had a birds' eye view of the cable car and harbourfront area. It would have been great, if the fans were functioning as it was a rather stuffy evening. But the staff was very kind to ask if we had wanted to switch to the indoor sitting area instead.Food was generally nice, tho' rather pricey and there weren't much choices for kids, I feel. Would be great if the restaurant could consider offering kids' meals. The staff who attended to us that evening were all very patient, helpful and friendly. And that had made our entire dining experience a very pleasant one. Keep it up
4
Good food and atmosphere.
A bit too expensive.
View is good at the top of hill.
Recommend to go again
4
Service from crew was top notch from the moment we were seated till we left.
Perfect place if you want to have a romantic sunset dinner.
5
Enjoyed the food, the view and the service! Favourite dessert got to be the cempedek bread pudding! :)
3
Food was alright. Service could be much better if they smiled and apologised for the wrong order served.
4
Great ambience and nice view atop Mount Faber. Great place for anniversaries and small celebrations. Can imagine the crowd during peak seasons like valentines.
4
It is a good place to have dinner with an amazing view. Slightly expensive but had an amazing experience. Will come back again!
5
Staff was very meticulous to our needs n even prepared a birthday surprise. Thank u for the awesome service. The wicked fries sauce I'd special but could have been better if it's with thin cut fries. We took the value meal (2main course, 1 appetizer, 1 dessert). We were full to the brim! Love the moscato. Light and fruity. Very apt for surprise, celebration.
4
Great scenery, good food. It's really reasonable especially if you are a 1 faber group member because you'll get 20% off. We had the cod fillet and king prawn pasta and it did not disappoint!Only problem was the jar of happiness, I had chocolate scoops last time but this time I was "forced" to have vanill
2
The waitress who served us was very moody.There was no smile or she do not even seems to be happy working.When she asking how the meat to be done. She was just rushing to get an answer from me.And she have that attitude of cant be bothered.It was my husband birthday and i didn't wan her to ruin the day.I didn't make a note prior to booking the seats in the note to make sure that we will have a good time at the restaurant.I also noticed that she displayed the same attitude to the family next to our table.Disappointed.As we came all the way from Eunos and expected at least a pleasant welcome.But i must say the chef who served us the food was friendly and made us comfortable. The food was also tasty
5
Had a birthday celebration and it was our first time here. The food here is delicious and their set meal is worth the value. Initially, they gave us a nice outdoor seat but my boyfriend prefers indoors which they proceeded to move us in without any hesitation. Afterwards, I bought a slice of cake thinking it will be part of the bill but to my surprise, it was on the house! The staff even helped to sing him a birthday song. Both of us had an enjoyable, private and romantic dinner up the hill and I would recommend this place to couples looking for a nice scenic birthday celebration with affordable settings and good food!
4
The venue had fantastic view and lots of natural light which was a refresher for team lunch. However the music was too loud if you wish to conduct any lunch discussions.
5
Sitting at peak of mount Faber, view is stunning. Food is a good mix of local and western cuisine. Service can be better by having more attentive servers.
3
The view is great, ambience is good, but honestly the service was so snobbish and the food bland and expensive...
4
Prices have increase quite significantly, from 70+ to 120+ for 2 pax. Overall good taste also drop. Chempedak dessert is a must try dessert. Still a nice ambience to dine in.
4
It was a pretty good dining experience. Their set meal for 2 was sufficient. Salmon could be better, it was rather bland. Service was rather poor, probably they were busy.
3
Visited the restaurant on a Friday night, didn't manage to get a good view. Restaurant is crowed with kids.
5
Excellent service and the ambience was very good. The pork belly my boyfriend ordered was too tough and we requested the kitchen to help change the dish. They came back and offered us a switch of the meal to another choice which left us pleasantly surprised.
4
Was surprised by how attentive and helpful the servers were and friendly too! Food was rather unique. Just a comment that the grilled king prawn with squid ink pasta in tomyum broth was more like a laksa broth because of the coconut milk/cream added. We also had the lamp chops, grilled salmon and cod with soba fillet.
5
Food quality and quantity was good for the pricing. The view and service is amazing too. However, it might be difficult for people on a tight budget to access the place as they will have to take the cable car or hire a taxi should they not have a vehicle if they prefer not to walk up mount faber from Harbourfront MRT station
5
Tried the 2 pax set and it was worth it. 2 starters, 2 mains and 1 dessert. We had the chilli crab in tux, foie gras, steak, cod fish and a jar of happiness. All tasted delicious. Staffs were also very helpful. They helped to take various shots for my partner and I. They also prepared a birthday cake upon my request. Would love to go back to dine again!
4
This place have great food with great service. Nice alfresco dining area with good view to look at too.
5
Had our anniversary and the staff service was very good. Good was value for money and the ambience was perfect! Thank you.
5
Went on a Friday night, wasn't crowded. Servings were huge and tasty.
The views were amazing for a three year olds birthday!
Chef was very accommodating to diet restrictions too!
Chope is easy to use. Fast and efficient for bookings.
5
Reserved and requested for a seat w a nice view. Despite the wet weather, staff still arranged a nice table with a great view. Good and very friendly service from the staff. There is a wide range of food selection and food was great.
4
The view was stunning. Waiters were very friendly and helpful. Overall it was quite a satisfying experience dining at the restaurant.
4
The atmosphere is good, we were directed to our seating area with a view. I love the chilli crab in a tux and the angus steak! It was so good.
5
Food was great and service was awesome. Other guests were very noisy, though. Not the restaurant's fault. Baby back ribs were roasted to perfection. Melted right off. Desert was perfect.
4
Nice bistro with a good view at the top of Mount Faber.Great for families, friends as well as for couples. The ambience can be romantic for couples yet relaxed and casual enough for families. Prices were reasonable. We liked the chilli crab in tux and the chempedek bread pudding.There was a koi pond and my kids enjoyed feeding the fish (Fish food can be bought from the cable car gift shop at $2 per pack)There was a marriage proposal when we were there too. After the dinner, our family took a walk around the area and to Henderson waves bridge.We will visit again. Recommended
4
Go there by Cable Car from Sentosa Station at Sentosa Island. Have a great lunch set for 2 persons at price SGD52++. Overall their food is tasty especially the lobster Hokkien Noodle and portion of food are good enough for 2 persons. Love their dessert, Chempedak(Jackfruit) Bread and Butter Pudding, very delicious. They have nice ambience and friendly staff too
1
We bought combined tickets for the buffet and cable car. The food was cold and very disappointing. Asian dishes only. Staff not interested at all. Asked for the spring rolls to be replaced with hot ones, which they did so willingly. $52 for 3 beers. Overpriced and underwhelming. View ok. Enjoy the cable car and skip the restauran
3
Nice food with lot of variety. The surrounding is fantastic for viewing. With cable car service, the dining experience there was just awesome! :)
4
We enjoyed a simple meal of soup and chips recently at this restaurant. The views are lovely and I love the way the trees are growing through the floor of the restaurant. It has the feel of being in the treetops :)
5
The overall ambience was great with great choice of music selection at background. There are a variety of food choices and it tastes good too. Really love the environment, quiet, scenic with a great view.
4
Celebrated my brother's birthday here, the staff put a candle on our dessert and sand him a song. Food was good, view was gorgeous, I have no complains
4
I have a Faber License membership that allows me unlimited cable car rides for a year and I have been to Spuds & Aprons a few times with colleagues and we have enjoyed the fantastic view and the food.
5
A must do. Typical bar food and beer but a beautiful patio, view and breeze made this one of my most favorite places in Singapore.
Also where the cable car to Sentosa Islands starts.
3
One of the more affordable eatery for a nice ambience of activities at Marina Bay, which for us is National Day. Booking was swift and the host was pretty prompt in replying. However, the rooftop bar was too busy on National Day and forgotten all about my requests for a dessert with a specially dedicated birthday greeting for my husband. Our dessert was served along with our appetizer even before the pizza came, and not with the gelato I preordered over the phone. Also, waitress didn't seem to have communicated with the hostess about my concern about the drinks included in the cover charge and didn't allowed my request for any non alcoholic drinks until I highlighted to her that I have preempt her colleague during my reservation that I'm pregnant. Nonetheless, the food is fine and service is okay which I believe could be better on a non peak period. Still a nice place to chill out if you aren't too particular about food
3
Good view with outdoor patio dinning experience. Beer was good and food was just fine, none of the dishes stands out. I had a Tobiko crusted cod fillet with soba which to me it was just average. Services is good and has happy hours from 5pm to 8pm
3
This was simply dinner with a view but nothing much else. The Lobster Ba La La dish came as a surprise to be laksa, but the lobster was either badly cooked or not fresh. The meat was so difficult to remove from the shell. Very disappointed with the value and quality of this dish
4
We ate dinner at Spuds & Aprons upon returning back to the Faber Cable Car Station after a day visiting Sentosa Island. The food is good and quite reasonably priced. Service is excellent, as are the scenic views. Definitely eat outside in the covered dining area
5
Good price, good food, commendable service. Staff replaced my main with a new one without hesitation when i gave feedback that the ribs was too dry and tough.
5
Food was great but service and ambience is great that have a scenic view from mount faber. Cosy place to have gathering with friends.
5
Celebrated my son's birthday there and we were impressed by the food, services and nice atmosphere on that evening. Thank you to all the staff for making our dining experience a memorable one!
4
The ambience is what makes this restaurant a place worth going for. Situated at the top of mount faber. Access is best by cable car. The food is good too, but a little pricey.
1
Too expensive for the taste and portion. The view was good and great to have healthy kids meal but overpriced and I see it as unreasonable to have a different menu during festive seasons
4
My friend & me dined indoor & the night views of the litted cable-cars were a pretty sight as we enjoyed our food. The place is bright & neat & looks nice. Will surely bring my friends over to chill out there... once again.
5
Love coming back to this place for special occasions. They make you feel right at home and with that view, wow! Pricing is reasonable, and food is not bad. Great for gatherings or dates.
4
2nd time here. sat at the same table as the 1st time (coincidence). was here last almost 2 months ago and yet one of the sweet, friendly waitresses actually recognised us (we knew she did as she said welcome back and you're sitting at your same table!) food was decent however the hokkien mee needs a bit more flavour. beautiful scenery as always :
1
I can't comment on the quality of the food or drinks, since I wasn't able to get any. After being unable to get the attention of any member of the staff for a considerable time, we walked out, rode the cable car to HarbourFront, and went to the Queen and Mangosteen in Vivo City.One of the reviews stated that they make you feel "at home" - I have to agree, at home, if I don't get the food myself, there won't be any.The view is nice, at least
4
I made my reservation via Chope and requested for a nice view for my boyfriend's birthday surprise. And indeed, we were brought to a table with nice view. We were in awe of the beautiful scenery.The staff there are also friendly and efficient.The food were in reasonable price and quality but the serving of food was kinda slow.1 star lost due to my email to Mount Faber Leisure Group Pte Ltd a few days before the event as i have a special request to surprise my boyfriend, and i was shocked to find out that my request to the guest relation officer was not disseminate to the spuds and apron staff, which he promised to do so.But the spud and apron staff were efficient enough to last minute prepare the dessert according to my request
3
Nice atmosphere for drinks but not for dinner. Food was just average.
Service was slow on a weekday dinner.
5
Great service, affordable & value for price. Nice environment, friendly service. Will definitely visit them again
4
Nice environment with beautiful view. Able to see fireworks at Sentosa. Great father's day dinner. Overall good experience.
4
Ambience and table arrangement was great, though they missed out that the reservation was for 6 pax instead of 5 pax. Otherwise, service was acceptable though one server does not know the dishes he's bringing out. Nonetheless, it was a great night!
5
Food was great and we were fortunate it was a good breezy day. Staff was great. The food portions could be bigger for the price
5
We met up to celebrate an old friend's birthday.The place provided a nice ambience and for our gathering.We enjoyed the dinner and the good service provided.
3
Staff is not alert on ordering. Have to call for few times only come to take my order. The food is alright, the view is fantastic.
3
Nice restaurant with good view of Sentosa. Went for dinner and the view was good especially after 8pm. Quality of food and service were acceptable.
5
I really enjoyed my experience at Spuds & Aprons. I made a reservation at 630pm but was late by a bit. Not only did the restaurant hold my reservation, they even gave me the exact seats that I requested when i made the reservation. Overall, i love the seats that they reserved for me, i felt that the food was great and the ambience was fantastic for a date. I would definitely recommend couples to enjoy a wonderful evening
1
The view from this place is stunning. To their credit the drinks are expensive but good. The service was average but polite.The food is another story - the most complementary thing I can call it is confused. I dined with three others. I had a chicken curry with rice crackers and by crackers I mean the whole foods version of a rice crispy treat (rice bubbles but with no sweetness added). One of my companions had barbecued chicken wings, they were deep fried, like KFC without the benefit of herbs and spices, with barbecue sauce on the side. Another had the pumpkin salad with quinoa etc etc. chunks of cold steamed pumpkin, a garnish of quinoa - and we are all for healthy choices but it still needs flavour and be something you could credible demand your children ate rather than understanding why they sit it out. The crowning glory was the pasta Verdi - an Asian Italian fusion that was not even close to the mark. It might have made more sense with egg noddles but as a pasta dish the chopped up olives from a jar with Asian mushrooms, asparagus, spinach and sliced garlic was just strange and wrong.Have a drink, enjoy the view but save your dollars and eat elsewhere
5
Like the atmosphere, this was my fourth time here. I alway request for the window view seating. I went so many times but not yet try the happiness jar dessert.
3
The environment was very nice with fabulous view overlooking Sentosa. But the food was too cheesy for my liking.
4
Great experience. Food was good and service fantastic. View of sentosa island at night was pretty. Good place to bring your date.
4
The view is beautiful, romantic, good for couple to dine here at night. The food and dessert is great also.
5
Loved the indoor window seating at a corner...... staff was kind enough to allow us to stay beyond 9pm so that we can finish our drinks
5
good service and good foods with a great view! good for couples that on budget yet wants a romantic place
5
Pretty great atmosphere, offering a great view of the sunset, and fireworks from USS. The signature dishes and desserts were great too!
5
The view was so amazing at night. Didnt know Singapore has such great view. The service was good too. Very attentive. The food was good too. It was value for money!
4
Dine with a good view and food portion is reasonable. Family oriented and reservation is recommended if you want a good view seating.
4
Was there for my anniversary dinner. View was perfect in the evening, even better at night. USS was just opposite and it was a Saturday, so there was fireworks display. Food was bomb as well esp the chilli crab in a tux. Loved every bite of it!
4
Atmosphere was good. Loves the crab linguine. Price is reasonable, given the ambience n quality of food, but portion is small.
3
Menu modest, food OK, service good , and prices reasonable. Ambience is of a cafeteria. A real wasted opportunity for such a spectacular location, and a dining let down because of it.
4
The food is nice and reasonably portion and the price is reasonable. The waiters and waitresses are attentive and make an effort to ask on food and replenish water when required.
3
Awesome view of the city. Our starters were good but mains were alright. The waiters also forgot our dessert and we heard them say it and when they served it they told us it takes a long time to get ready.
5
The food was good and the atmosphere was very nice and relaxing. It was really breezy and nice at the top of the hill.
3
Plus side, good view. Downside, average tasting food. Ordered the baby back ribs. BBQ sauce was too rich to my liking. Chilli crab tux had to much sauce to potato ratio.
3
It is a romantic place to have lunch or dinner with your love one. On top of mountain you can enjoy view of Singapore. Restaurant is not so crowded during lunch time. But waiters are not so helpful and attentive
4
The place offers great views and is very relaxing.The service was efficient but the flip side the food is a bit on expensive side and not much for vegetarians.Since Faber peak is a touristy place they should try to make the place more affordable.The food tastes good so was the cocktails though
4
The ala-carte menu looks more inventive, so we were a tad wary of trying the local lunch buffet. We paid only $10 under the Sentosa online promotion, which made it a good deal. My favourite part of the buffet was the plump and juicy chicken, with the accompanying fragrant chicken rice. The stir-fried prawns were a tad on the small side and nothing spectacular, but surprising highlights were the silky smooth mapo tofu, dry laksa (great fragrance and texture!) and fried spring rolls. Views from the restaurant was great, with sweeping views of the city below. The staff were also pleasant and more than willing to help to take photos. Overall, the buffet felt like one of those catering buffets you find at parties, but with better quality food. The ala-carte menu should be a better option if you are thinking of whether to go for the buffet or try the regular menu...$29 seems really steep for the selection of local delights
4
Desserts were unique and tasty. Just be prepared to get stung by a few mozzies if you happened to reserve the outdoor seats. Fortunately, the staff provided us with moxie patch when we requested for it. Overall, my experience was pleasant and would visit again for the scenic view and their desserts
5
We're sitting indoors. Nice view from the hill and environment, the food is also excellent. But the soft drinks are normal and a bit expensive.
5
Food was reasonably priced as they got lunch set combo menu. Staff was nice and prompt! Got a very nice seat viewing the facade from mount faber. Would come here again soon!

Nice ambience..nice food..romantic place for a nice and quiet dinner.
Celebrated Valentine's Day at the restaurant and we were seated at a table with a nice view
4
The for was nice n hot. Ambience was good for a outdoor dining and it is very cooling. Staff was very helpful and nice.
4
Atmosphere was great and love that the kids can be entertained too. Food was also generally good but a little pricey. I had the cod and it was nice but the sauce was too overpowering and needed to be less salty/sour. The sweet potato fries was nice too. The truffle wicked fries lacked the truffle taste and was a bit disappointing. Overall a good experience! Will come back
3
Average $45 per pax with drinks.Nice views from Mt Faber in an air con area though families with small active toddlers should opt for the open non air con space.Food averageService : minimal as only 1 waitress when we arrived at 1pmCooking n sauces are good but the lamb chop cuts were 50% fats. Salmon was very good.Chicken mediocre like a fast food outlet Go there for the nice views and a one time experience.

Call up to check reservations for birthday celebration dinner, i ask if any cake for birthday, staff tell me, apron request . So I ask again, so can I request than? She told can, it will serve later and ask what type I want, than she list out the dessert in the menu list , but all is not cake . I am asking for cake!! So I tell her again, I asking for cake . Do your have cake , finally she understand CAKE mean , and tell me cake is base on 1st came 1st service. Fine than, so I ask her again, since I book for birthday and to prevent disappointment that birthday boy no cake , than I can bring my own cake than. She said can. good . So I ask for help to keep 1st the cake I bring myself so that it keep fresh ? She said "I dun think so, we do not help to keep. " And silence. This is totally unacceptable reply and not friendly at all as the past reviews wrote. I am very worried she will spoil the hold birthday dining experience. The price in menu and service given are not match, the only can do is go to take photo with nice view and can go off to other same pricing restaurants with 100x more better service!

Stopped off at the top of Faber peak and decided to have something to eat. A full Asian buffet was available. (not sure if this is every day). Anyway, soup, 15+ dishes and fruit salad to end with. Eat as much as you like. Best value for money so far in Melbourne
4
Reception was fast. They arranged a window seat for us as requested. Could be better if it wasn't the corner seat as it was slightly blocked. Ordered chilli crab in a tux, crispy pork belly & Tobiko crusted cod fish which are worthy of its chef's recommendation status
4
Arrival at Faber Peak and the location of Spuds & Aprons was fairly easy, however I need not see any signage to indicate that I was to walk up a flight of stairs to get to the restaurant, perhaps a sign to indicate that at the vehicle drop-off point would be beneficial for first time customers. The restaurant was fairly busy when we arrived, but I would be expecting a slightly better service from the staff. No doubt they were busy but they could at least acknowledge our presence and tell us to hang on for a moment at the entrance of the al fresco area instead of leaving us and a couple more customers waiting until they were available.Nonetheless, the food ordered arrived fairly quickly (between fast food and fine dining) and the amount we paid for and the actual amount of food we got left us with full hearts and stomachs. The view at Spuds & Aprons was second to none, no comments to that. Check it out yourself if you're that interested.
5
Excellent food, excellent view, excellent service for reasonable prices! The staff were fun and friendly and did their best to put a smile on our faces!
5
All was well during our diner at spuds and aprons.
Definitely worth going up the hill to enjoy, good food and and amazing view.
5
My parents and I had a very enjoyable time with the interesting foods and the splendid view of Sentosa!
1
share table with all the tourist groups.
Food are terrible.
Even with 14.9 promotion, it's not worth it. Worse than eating in hawker center
4
Good view looking out to Sentosa, in the evening. Attentive staff and good service, in recommendation and requests.

Last Saturday, my friend and I went for a walk from Kent Ridge MRT to Mt Faber. This is known as the Southern Ridges walk and the trail passes through the Keng Ridge Park, the Hort Park, Alexander Arch (bridge), Forest Walk, Telok Blangah Hills Park, Henderson Waves (bridge) before finally ending up at the view point of Mt Faber, which affords fantastic view across the sea towards Sentosa Island, and the surrounding area.As I had tried the cakes here, I suggested to go for lunch here. Due to the great location on the hill top, and just right next to the Cable Car station heading across to Sentosa Island, it is a lovely place, and airy to have a nice meal, a good chat and a wonderful time.My recommendation for you is either take a walk from HarbourFront MRT and exit from Vivo City Shopping Mall, cross the road, and follow the sign for the Marang Trail, up the flight of steps, to the Spuds Restaurant. Otherwise, take a taxi up there.It is better to come up here at home, as the cable cars departing from the station are lit up with blinking lights. Then, you can enjoy a romantic dinner with your loved one, with the great view and the blue hour (one hour after the sunset) here. It will be magical.We had Norwegian Salmon, and the mashed potato is so awesome, with the butter and very tasty. The chicken wings were just average. We had cranberry juice.If you come by Singapore, don't forget to go up to Mt Faber and enjoy the meal up there

I friends visiting Singapore over the weekends so I made a booking at Spuds and Aprons. Was possibly given the beat seats in the restaurant with optimum privacy in a nice nook overlooking the breathe taking view of Sentosa Island as the sun began to set.Service here was also amazing. Attentive and helpful waiters attended to us all evening.The one thing you would probably have to bear with would be the on going hammering of the giant bell next to the restaurant! But it does become white noise after a while

we went for the ongoing local buffet lunch promotion, supposedly priced at $29 if you visit faber peak's website you can see the price. fortunately for us, we bought vouchers which came at $10 each, else it would be a complete waste of $$ and time.first off, they provided disposable paper plates, styrofoam bowls, plastic cups, plastic forks & spoons, and disposable chopsticks. the impression was already bad, i felt like i was eating at some cheap chalet buffet setup the spread was miserable, rice, noodles, tofu, very bad fish, prawns, chicken rice (which ran out and was empty when we arrived), chicken rice chicken, curry vegetables (also ran out), samosa & spring rolls (also ran out), some other fried noodle (also empty), green bean soup and some fruit cocktail (obviously canned), there were 3 drink dispensers, but only 1 was in service with super sweet green tea (and which also ran out eventually)the spread was typical of those home catering for 20 pax at $8-9 , food was not particularly tasty, and of course eating on paper plates (can you imagine the curry/sauces/ etc) soaking through while you're walking around, and don't even get me started on carrying HOT food on a paper plate (you have to carry it with an open palm or else the curry/sauce will spill over the edge) and you have a burning palmit was particularly wind so i didn't get to enjoy the view because the wind was blowing off the half-empty paper plates on the table, and i wasn't keen to have curry/sauces all over my kids , so we had to hold them downall in all, i'm glad we only paid $10 each, even then, i think i'd have had a much more enjoyable meal at any local food court (with a much better variety/spread/quality of food) with my $10 per pax (imagine the spread we can buy with $100 at the food court or hawker center) never coming back again unless they switch back to proper utensils and plates (talk about UN-environmentally friendly), and even then.... i'd have to think twiceoh, and valet parking costs $6, so yeah, not coming backsorry no photos, remember i was holding down the plates so i didn't even get the see the view, so, definitely no time for photos, just picture the worst buffet at your distant relative's son's birthday celebration at an east coast chalet 10 years ago, and the setting is about ther

Our mastermind group meets at different locations from time to time and this month we went to Spuds and Aprons at the top of Mt Faber. I hiked up from Harbourfront MRT (Exit A) and it got my heart-rate up which I enjoy. Most would prefer a bus or taxi to the top. The food was good but the service was odd. One of us got all his food before 2 of us got anything to eat. The water is 'help yourself' which is okay but the glasses are small. (one of the problems with most 'help yourself' water places... they want to SELL drinks) The views are fantastic and the restaurant midweek was quiet enough to have a lunch discussion. We are thinking of coming back again for one of our meetings
3
We visted for lunch as part of a package with the Sentosa Cable Car. The western food offerings were really quite awful. Our companions had selected from this not realising that there was a buffet of local food. This buffet arrangment was super yum! Especially for a buffet. The curry chicken was rich and tasty but the Singapore Chicken Rice was the best I had on our visit to Singapore...believe it or not! The views were ofcourse 5 stars. There is a bar so you can have a few drinks with your lunch and take in the fantastic views whilst you brunch or lunch. I can only imagine how lovely this place woul dbe in the evening
4
Great for family. They have kids menu and the entree not too bad. Overall is a pleasant dining experience.
4
Very enjoyable lunch on the top of Mount Faber enjoying extensive views . Prices were reasonable, . Music a bit loud!
Food good,
Service good.
Can drivd there go by cable car or do the treetop walkways from Hort Park via the Hennderson Waves.
5
Ordered their festive set for 2 pax. Steak was very tender and juicy. Loved the jar of happiness dessert! Very was very lovely too :)
5
I had dinner with my fiancé and her family. Definitely enjoyed the view and the service was superb. Will definitely go back
4
Came here for lunch after taking a ride on the cable car - it was an adhoc decision but we did not regret it.The service is great (even though they had a private party ongoing); and the view is excellent (provides a distraction for kids!).We may return the next time there's a special occasion
4
Had organised a birthday celebration dinner and was delighted to have the staff who have assisted in preparing on the item that I had ordered a delivery from a third-party which came early. Was also given a table that has a great view overlooking the Harbourfront Center
4
Came to celebrate a birthday. Glad they reserved a table at the outdoor area overlooking the harbourfront area for us. Very funny host that we encountered, full of jokes, so that was .However do not order wine by the glass. Their standard pour is a joke. Probably just half of what a standard pour should be. The chicken and salmon mains are just decent.
1
I brought my girlfriend and her parents to this restaurant to celebrate her birthday a few days back, which I mentioned to their staff several times over the phone and over the email. I chose this restaurant because of the alfresco style that it offers and the range of food that was shown on its website. Unfortunately, when we got there, we were directed to the ballroom below the alfresco level. The reason that we got was that the buffet has been shifted down to the ballroom. It was very disappointing as I was promising my girlfriend and her parents a good view from the peak, but we ended up in the stuffy and gloomy ballroom, which had no view at all. The food was even more disappointing - there were only slightly more than 10 plus dishes only and there were really nothing special about the food. They were more of the Teochew porridge style kind of dishes, like the salted/preserved vegetables. It was well below expectation. My emails to their staff previously also took them a few days to reply. My last email to clarify with them on the booking also DID NOT ELICIT any email replies at all.For those who are expecting to have a gourmet style, this is NOT the place to be in. Probably suitable if you are just looking to make yourself feel full in the stomach only. Further, prepare for surprises too
5
I had an excellent dinner at spuds and aprons. Thank you Zakiyyah for allowing us to have an amazing experience!  We were assigned a private seating area with a clear sea view, it was really beautiful and therapeutic. Next, Zakiyyah welcomed us with a warm smile and provided recommendations for us, since it was our first time visiting spuds and aprons. She would constantly check in on us during the various courses, the food was fantastic but the service was top notch. Overall, it was a value for money restaurant, do check it out guys! However I would like to highlight something which could be improved. As the restaurant is quite spacious, it was quite hard to alert the service staff when I require something, it would be great if the manager could separate the restaurant into sections to ensure that the customers could easily grab the service staff attention
4
When we were first seated, the staff immediately brought an additional seat for us to place our bags. They were attentive whenever we needed their assistance. Do note that their portion of the mains (pasta related) can be quite big for a typical Asian appetite. The food was really good and the sunset scenery by the viewing panel is rather romantic
3
Went for dinner over weekend. Ambience is good with great view of the city & Sentosa island.
Food was not good.
4
Great place for group dinner. Make reservation to get tables that overlooks Sentosa. Catch fireworks every hour from 8pm, every day. The curry lobster is huge! Very nice. Highly recommended.
4
The food was good and we loved the dessert. Staff were friendly and service was good. The food was a little overpriced though.
5
Fantastic Ambience and my girlfriend enjoyed the food and location of this place! Very pleasant experience for the two of us! Recommended to couples for celebrations!
4
Went Spuds & Aprons for team lunch. Overall it was a good experience, most people like the food and the price is reasonable if you choose the set lunch. And the view is awesome!
4
The crews are all very friendly n nice.. the area was cooling n good atmosphere. Will definitely be there again
4
The staffs were friendly. Food were great, especially the Chilli Crab Tart. I like the scenery and the ambient up the top of the hill.
3
Food was mediocre as it wasn't served piping hot. However, it is still worth a trip up there to have a cup of coffee and enjoy a quiet afternoon/dinner with your friends and family.
4
Wide variety of food to choose from, a good place with good ambience to de-stress and good service provided.
4
We went to have a birthday celebration dinner and the staff was attentive, food came fast and was pretty decent. We loved the fries with gravy, the crab linguine and the dessert of bread and pudding top everything. Great view overlooking the sea and skyscrapers. Definitely worth a visit.
5
Staffs there were super friendly and helpful. Food were awesome too, not too pricey. However it can be quite inconvenient.
4
Great ambience with amazing food. Thankfully there was shelter at the alfresco dining area. Will definitely visit again!
4
Nice ambience with good choices of food variety. Quite worth the price and good place for function and small gatherings.
4
Great ambience and view of the city. Quiet thursday evening well spent. Decent service. And good staff. Food was good roo.
5
From the starter to the mains and desserts were fantastic. Our guest from overseas enjoyed the food, service and ambiance very much. We will definitely come back.
5
The ambiance and food were great! We enjoyed the beautiful view from the restaurant. It reminded me of Victoria Peak in Hong Kong.
5
Great ambience, excellent service from staffs, very attentive to our needs. Good job! Overall, reccomended for great view and nice dinner. Must try the chilli crab appetizer. Happy hour whole day for beer on tap.Great view looking at cable cars and the lights of sentosa and vivo city. Free valet parking for spending more than $50.Staffs are friendly and and accommodating. Allow us to choose a table based on our preference
4
Our family of six adults chose this restaurant to celebrate a birthday . Ambience is good. We are seated overlooking the Sentosa skyline. Service staff is responsive to our orders. Has free valet parking when dining there. The lamb chop ( Baa Baa Licious) is tender and good to taste. Crispy pork belly is great too. Tobiko Cod fillet is satisfying. The Pasta Vongole and Pan fried Norwegian Salmon is normal.With a Erdinger beer, ginger ale，jasmine tea, matcha latte and brew coffee , total bill is about S$206. (after about 10% mastercard discount except beer） Overall happy with the dinner. This restaurant is at Mt Faber near Cable car station. Take stairs to level two. (Make a booking to avoid disappointment)(Visit the level 1 toilet which is clean and has a view too.
5
We made a reservation n was given a wonderful seating and view. The outdoor seatsling is amazingly cool and the stuff is friendly and will even advise that the order is kinda too much for 3 pax :) food portion is large and tasty. Love the sweet potato fries!
3
The restaurant has a scenic view (facing sentosa island) and it's nice being able to see cable car zipping by as we dine in the restaurant. The service staff performed within expectation, and was able to explain the ingredient of the dishes.We order a devilish combo. Happy chicken wing was our starter. For the 2 mains, we ordered oven roasted mustard marinated chicken as well as barbecued baby back ribs. We had chempedak Bread & butter pudding as our dessert. Food portion was filling, but the taste was just average. Did not finish up the 4 chicken wings as appetite was affected as the chicken wing was not fried properly (there is slight blood) Dessert no doubt was good though
5
Loved the outdoor seating during evening time as you get to njoy the food and sunset with family and friends!
1
restaurant is not well prepared for bad weather. staff is not helpful. even when you give feedback, you do not feel that they are apologetic. do not visit when it's going to rain.
3
Will be here again for drinks/view but not for food.
Service staff should be more alert.
Drinks are alright.
5
The service staffs are amazingly helpful! They help with many small arrangements to make the dinner perfect & amazing.
5
Friendly staff and great service!
Due to bad traffic jam during Friday evening, I had to push back my reservation for about half an hour but the staff were very accommodating!
Food portion and taste were decent too.
Not to forget amazing sunset view!
5
food is nice with the nice view, price is reasonable as well, good place for a nice meal with your loved ones
3
I really like this place. it gives you a sense of space and openness the food and the service are pretty average though particularly for its price.
Still worth a visit for the view and perfect for an afternoon coffee or drink
1
Food sucks. Even Astons and Coffee shop's western food taste better than here zzz. ***WARNING***Do not try the chicken and beef, tasteless, too dry and meats are too hard. Disappointed.
4
A place for nice romantic dinner with family and loved ones. Kids loved the koi pond and wishing bell.
4
May partner and I took the cable car from Sentosa to Mount Faber and had lunch at this restaurant.We sat looking out towards Sentosa and enjoyed the view. There are no windows and no air conditioning, but a nice breeze.The lunch menu is simple with a mix of western and local favourites. We had laksa and hokkien noodles which were very delicious, and my mango smoothie was perfect in the hot sunshine. It was the best value meal we had while in Singapore.Service was friendly and efficient. There is a little garden and pond with koi carp and spotless loos. Also the cable car gift shop.We were able to walk out a little way to see more views from Faber point, where lots of coaches full of tourists were stopping. It's a popular spot, but the restaurant wasn't too busy
5
Totally love this restaurant, staff are attentive and efficient, food was nicely presented and very tasty, view was fantastic, really enjoyed the night at this restaurant! Thank you for everything!
4
Waitress there are very polite in asisting us to make sure we had a wonderful experience. We really enjoy our dining!
4
My first time there.great experience.beautiful view. Windy and cool weather. Food comes with big portion.
4
One of the chef's signature dishes for $19 is the lobster hokien noodles. Yum yum yum. Best meal of my trip. 1/2 pint of tiger beer $12. Nice view and breeze.
4
It was surreally wonderful to be dining at such a high peak , outdoors and with nice breeze blowing in your face.
4
Went there for our anniversary celebration. Nice atmosphere, good service and food was good. Will for sure go back.
5
Come here primarily in for the excellent view of Mount Faber and Sentosa. Perfect for both families and couples. Food is secondary but affordably good.
4
We had a great time with our friends and the kids as we took in the beautiful sight of sunset whilst having our dinner!
3
We had a visitor from USA and decided to bring him for dinner at Spuds and Aprons. I must say that the parking facilities are really very basic and if you miss the parking lots you might have to drive down Mount Faber and take another 10 mins drive back. After the parking part is settle there comes the food menu. I personally think that the menu is pretty limited, the prices are a little high and not for the fact that the view from this location is a pretty rare find for a Singaporean, This might be the first and last time for me
5
Love coming back here to eat - the food is consistently amazing and up to standard. Usually we would get the indoor seating in the afternoons or nights when it's quiet. It may have been a busy period. We sat outdoors this time and there were tons of tourists from the cable car centre who purchased food and cable car packages that took up a lot of space in the restaurant making the ambience quite hectic and noisy
4
Friendly and responsive staff .... food was nice. Requested to be seated outdoor with nice view. Ambience was nice with night scene over looking sentosa and harbour front.
3
The food was nicely presented, however, as the website was not updated, the promotions that we wanted were not available.
Great ambience to chill and relax.
3
Views were blocked by huge pillars. Food was average, but not enough to Wow me. Order 2 starters, 2 mains and 2 non-alcoholic drinks. Came up to $120.
4
Had 6 pax meal with 3 desserts n 3 starters. Average about $35. Nice view, good desserts n great sevice
4
Food was good and the portion was generous. The service staff were polite and prompt. Overall was a pleasant experience.
5
We stopped here as it was the highest point of the Mount Faber cable car line, and had Singapore Slings overlooking the harbour and Sentosa Island. It was a lovely place to stop, and service was great. The drinks were served quickly and tasted great.
5
Service was effecient, food also tasted good! Price is reasonable but the view is excellect! Would definitely go back again!

The wife wanted to head up Mount Faber so we drove up. It has been a while so we did not know The Jewel Box is now closed. Next to the old jewel box is Spuds & Aprons.The place looked horrible, in a sea of red, with cheap-looking tables and chairs. The air-conditioned area was closed as the a/c was not working (according to the waitress anyway).The outdoors area was hot and served mediocre food in small portion but expensive price. Food was not great but not horrible, it was just food, something to fill your tummies.We had to wait a long time to get a table with a blocked view, although there were many other unoccupied tables with better views throughout our stay, they would not let us have them, claiming that they were all reserved.It was hot and humid, and we overpaid for below average food at a table with a blocked view.We are definitely not coming back. They have wasted a perfectly nice spot for fine dining with such a horrible restaurant.Pack your food and sit at the park to enjoy the night lights, that would be a much better idea.
4
There is both outdoor and indoor seating. The view from both side is absolutely stunning, especially at night for you can see the view of the concrete jungle and at the same time the cable cars moving in and out. There is a combo meal set where you can choose to have or just ala carte, also the portions for the food is really big
5
 Of all restaurants that i've been , i can say Spuds and Aprons is the best in terms of service.From the time you arrive , friendly staff greet you with a smile. Food is excellent and value for money. Overall i can recommend Spuds and Aprons for whose who is looking for great but affordable food.
4
The mosquito problem could perhaps be addressed with the planting of lemongrass, and pandan leaves around the restaurant? We had three mosquito patches (two were placed by the service crew beneath our tables) but it didn't help.
5
Very good view, food is good and value for money, will definitely recommand to friends, enjoy the visit
3
The ambience and atmosphere was good but the food was average and at a steep price. Would recommend the dessert and side snacks but no the main meals
5
Headed there to celebrate my sister's birthday. The staff were really helpful and attentive. They are also very proactive. Have a great experience here. Highly recommended.
3
We came here for some dessert and drinks after having dinner at a nearby resto. The ambience is lovely, a great place to hangout. We didnt choose to have dinner here because of the poor reviews.
4
I had dinner at Spud & Aprons on 5th June. Since the reservation was made, we were taken to our table with a view of Sentosa as requested. The service was quick and efficient by the staff. She even recommended the food and beverages. I ordered the Chilli Crab in Tux, Baby Back Ribs, Norwegian Salmon and Cempedak Bread & Butter Pudding. It was a set meal for 2 pax which also came with a sampler of their Wicked Fries.The star for the night would be the Chilli Crab in Tux. The ribs were slightly too dry for my liking while the salmon was just average. The cempedak bread & butter pudding is a must try!I would recommend this place for diners looking to have some simple food with a great ambiance.
5
We're family with a 2yr old. We visited this restaurant by the cable car. Really impressed with the food here and the view is something else! Meals are $16 - $45 but they do a meal deal for a starter, 2 mains and a dessert for $70. It was probably our most expensive meal because we don't splash out often but this was the place to do it.Couldn't fault any of it. The restaurant is even built around two old trees and you can ring the bell to bring you eternal happiness - what more could you want! ;
5
Went here with my best friend, sister and brother in law for their birthday dinner as it was recommended by my friend for the nice ambiance. The view is great. Even if it has been quite warm and humid these days in Singapore, it wasn't that humid there. Food portions are bigger than expected and it was delicious. Would definitely go back again one day
3
Visited Spuds & Aprons upon recommendation from a friend. Arrived on a rainy evening and was given an alfresco seating which was pretty cooling. Ordered Chicken Wings, Chili Crab with Potato Skins, Fried Crispy Skin for appetizer and Lamb Rack, Crispy Pork Belly as Main Course and See Saw Banana-nana as the dessert. Chicken Wings was ordinary, Chili Crabs with Potato Skins was decent but too pricey with only 3 pieces. Fried Crispy Skin is nothing unique. Lamb Rack was generous with 4 pieces given its price but the Crispy Pork Belly was an absolute disaster at $27.00. The Meat was extremely hard and the Portion served to me was 3 giant pieces which was so hard to eat. It should have been sliced for better eating especially dinner and with the "die die must try", it was a huge disappointment. The Dessert Portion was also pathetic and the taste was mediocre.Overall, The experience was not really enjoyable and the food is horrible
2
Food was terrible. Pasta was under cooked, chicken meat was very dry. But one thing good about this place was the service. One of the service staff actually did a service recovery when he realise a lot of food was left upon clearing, he offered happy hour rates for our beverages
5
Received excellent services from the staff and enjoyed the ambience. Free valet parking with $50 and above spendinf
4
My family and I ate lunch at spuds and aprons, my 3rd time coming here. Food is good, big portions esp the chicken meal. I ordered pasta vongole and it tastes great. Desserts are good too.
5
Happen to drop by after a day out from sentosa. Nice ambience , delicious food and friendly service.
So happy that we came. Will come visit again... very soon.
3
Decided to have some lunch here after catching the cable car across from Sentosa. Views were great as the restaurant is right at Faber Peak. Service was a bit slow and the food was OK.
2
How do you get this wrong? The location is magical and the customers are delivered to the doorstep courtesy of the excellent cable car. But the staff are dreadful. The menu is fairly expensive but you expect to pay a bit of a premium for the stunning views. But it wouldn't hurt for the staff to smile and make an effort at doing their job.We simply wanted a coffee but we were made to wait for so long at the table we were directed to that we started to think we had to order at the bar. So up I jumped to check, only for the duty manager to assure me it was indeed table service and he took our order himself.The coffee was OK, not great but not bad either.To finish the experience, we were forced to wait for ages to get change after paying. Perhaps they were hoping we'd give up and leave it as a tip? Hardly likely when they already included a service charge and the service was so bad.The irony? The staff all wore shirts which proclaimed the importance of living with happiness. I don't think we saw a single one of them smile once
3
we were delighted to be seated at an unblocked al fresco table for two. the view of harbourfront at sunset was relaxing and very pleasant. into the evening,, we can see fireworks over at sentosa island. quite a treat and change to the usual mall eats
4
I and my business associates visited spuds & apron at Mount Faber cable car station recently. The view and ambience is soothing and nice to have food and drink in relaxation. We had crab in a tub, pork belly, lamb chop, roast chicken. The dishes were good and we enjoyed our self with some drinks as well. Special appreciation to a staff of the restaurant one mr ajaib who was very pleasant and responsive to our orders and he was able to serve our request. It is nice to have staff like ajaib,who can make your evening more pleasant
4
We were greeted at the entrance by lovely staff and though we weren't seated at the best seats, we were still able to see the lovely horizon and enjoy the ambience of the evening's delights. We had just dined at the Mt Faber Sky dining so were only stopping by for a few drinks. We ordered the 2 for 1 Singapore Slings which were delicious! The staff were kind and weren't intrusive so we were able to make our order at our leisure and not rushed. They were also very helpful and made the overall experience very enjoyable
1
Visited this place 2 weeks ago Sunday late afternoon and sat down at a table with a view (as there was no staff welcoming me and the restaurant/terrace was about 1/3 full max). I sat down at a small table part of a row of tables positioned next to eachother. There were large tables all around and there was more than enough space to accommodate any other visitors. The waiter approached and asked me 'How many are you?' to which I replied that it was just me. Next thing he said was 'You can't sit here by yourself'. Anything along the lines of 'Sir, apologies but would you mind sitting somewhere else? There may be some large groups coming in' would have been acceptable but the total absence of any politeness shocked me. If he had asked nicely I would have gladly moved and even stayed there for some drinks and perhaps dinner. Clearly this place is only focused on tourists and does not care about repeat business
5
We went to take the cable car and "dropped in" this restaurant. With a family of three together, we ordered the combo meal for 2 persons and an additional salad. The seafood pasta (in white wine sauce) and the baby back rib were both very well done. The portion for the rib was also quite substantial, more than what i would normally expect in Singapore. We probably didn't really need the additional salad, but the salad with fried fish skin was interesting as well. One waitress, though looked quite young, was very attentive and knowledgeable. Again a nice surprise. It's not easy to encounter such good service in Singapore these days. Nevertheless, the restaurant seems short-handed for its size.The view overlooking the Sentosa Island and the waterfront is just fantastic.All these worked for about $100 in total for three. Quite reasonable. We didn't order drinks. The drink menu does look pricey
4
Way to visit here by Singapore cable car from resort world sentosa. Have a good food and bakery. Must visit here. Nice view to sentosa.

Ordered a Mango smoothie - got some kind of chemical s h i t. Tasted like a ice cream with sugary syrup :( Not even close to a real smoothie. If yon't know what a smoothie is and how to make it, then don't put it in menu and scam people

A great place for dining with sky and sea view. We were 4 of us and ordered a black label whisky priced at $190plus taxes. Beer was cheap as oit was happy hour time. We ordered lamb chop, crab in tux, French dip chips, pork and soup. The whisky was pricey compared to the food which was reasonable. Overall spuds and apron is ok to spend an evening for dinner. Weekday the place closes by 11pm and last orders are before 10pm. worth for its beautiful ambience. Faber license holders get 20% discount and we got the discount as I am a member

We started the cable car on Sentosa so went to Faber Peak and stopped at Spuds and Aprons for a drink. Had two milkshakes and 6 chicken wings to share whilst we took in the view, cost was $48 - which even in Singapore was pretty high - but the view was nice.

What a scam! Ten dollars for a milkshake and $8 for a smallish bowl of soup. OK, fair enough - you get a nice view and the surroundings are pleasant enough. Went to pay my bill, expecting to hand over $18. But wait....10% service charge! For what? - walking over and (eventually) taking my order and then walking over and giving me my food? But then there was more - another 7% GST added on top. Shouldn't all prices be quoted as GST-inclusive? Most civilised countries do.After paying that for my small lunch, I didn't bother with the cable car, and chose to walk down to Harbourfront
3
It was situated on the Mt Faber so it can only be accessible via cars or cable cars. And since it is on a hill, the place is relatively quiet and the scenery is beautiful. On top of that, there is a 1-1 wine promotion and the selection is good. Just beside the restaurant, there is an area called Bells of Happiness. Instead of the padlocks fastened on the bridge in Paris and Seoul, here you see bells. The entire place is jnstagrammable. As for food, I would say it is mediocre.

Lovely view and a nice play to get away from the typical restaurant that you find in the shopping centres over in Singapore. The food is all right, it's nothing to shout about. We had great service. If you spend more than $50 (which isn't difficult, in Singapore), you get free valet parking (otherwise it's $6).They also had a combo, which was 1 entrees, 2 mains, one dessert for $70. And on top of that, you also get a free side order of cheesey fries.We had the ribs and the meat was very tender, fell off the bone (no unglamourous gnawing needed), and pasta vongole (nothing to shout about, and portion of clams was decent) chilli crab on potato skins (as entree) - recommended and duck wrapped in vietnamese rice paper rolls (OK, I wouldn't order this again). The ice cream in our dessert was rock hard. I would go back here because it's a change from the usual restaurants because of the view. There is also an indoor or outdoor seating, so if it rains, you can still head indoors. It's also quiet, which is nice and rare in Singapore (for that price). The only drawback is that you do need transport to get there and if you are a real foodie, this might not be the place for you. Overall, we spent just over $100 for 2 entrees (and got another free), 2 mains, 1 dessert and a beer. Reasonable priced for decent food, especially in Singapore. This is the kind of price I'd pay overseas for the same quality of food, so we were pleased and will go back

After touring Sentosa island for a whole day, I was advised to go and have a dinner at the top of Faber mountain/peak. The view from the cable car from Sentosa island to the peak was absolutely breathtaking. During night time, the lights emitted from cable cars resembles star shines across the horizon when you are in the restaurant. The atmosphere is calm. Kids menu is availabile. The menu is mainly western type. The meals are well priced
3
The food is good but nothing to write home about. We had the chilli-crab-filled potatoes, which were a bit dry, and the seafood noodles which were OK, but not much in the way of taste. The ice cream was delicious, but you can't really mess that up. The view is of course sublime and in itself a good reason to come here for an ice cream. The service however completely lets the place down. Inattentive and seemingly inexperienced. One waiter tried to tell us that the price for three scoops of gelato only applied if you went for three of the same flavour. Another came to our table to deliver the bill (after we asked for it three times and finally had to go up to the counter) and didn't take the finished plates away, instead removing the water pitcher without asking whether we still wanted any. This is not the first time we've had this experience. The previous time was a bit over a year ago and it was exactly the same.

The location was fantastic, the atmosphere? awesome! The view: marvelous. The food? I dont know really.We arrived , waited and no one cared until i called one of the staffs attention. As soon we were sitted, no one gave the menu so i have to grab one for us. When it's time for us to order, almost all the staff gave me a hand signal to wait. Ouch! We were fascinated at how poor the service was. Finally one of them got free from acting like it was so busy, she took our order and then the long wait starts. We waited for eternity and then i asked about what happened to our order. The lady assured me that it will be ready. Then comes another 30 min wait until my partner got annoyed and left. I followed, we headed off back to the cable car station. Then someone from the restaurant chased us and asked if we have paid. Lol!!! what an embarassment coz we were not served in the first place. So we came back and told them , we were there waiting for an hour and none of our orders was served. Then the annoying apologies and we were allowed to leave
3
We alighted the cable car for a refreshment and take in the vista for a while. Spectacular view and our visit coincided with happy hour which enhanced the pleasure of the experience.
4
Just had an early lunch with kids here. Depending on what you order, the adult menu was fine but kids was average. Suggest to change kids menu free drink from mocktail to either fruit juice or just a scoop of ice cream.
5
Had a fantastic lunch before departing on the cable car to Sentosa. Service was excellent, food terrific and the views amazing. Faber Peak is a wonderful place to visit.
1
The company slogan of "high on happiness" was not evident on the faces of staff or customers. Frozen pizza and stale wet spring rolls are not up to the standard we expected, great location but so much missing the point
5
Brought my family here for dinner during the weekend. I was surprised that it had changed so much. The outside sitting of the restaurant is fantastic. Good place to chill out with your love one or friends and overlooking the skyline of Sentosa. The indoor is good too but not so much ambient as outside. I would recommend to call up and reserve first. If it is an family outing I would suggest getting the indoor one and leave the love birds alone
2
Firstly the staff here seem more interested in making sure everyone sits at the tables as soon as you enter despite having hosts of empty tables along the veranda area with amazing views. First we had to push to get a table away from the till area (which meant someone would have to walk to us) and then we had to argue that we could sit beside a window....apparently it's dangerous because I might walk into it. Well....firstly I might walk into it if it was clean, however with the amount of smudges on it that wasn't going to be an issue. Secondly, if a glass window means that your tables with a view (YOUR UNIQUE SELLING POINT) cannot be used, then get rid of it!The food.... not worth mentioning. 2 stars only because of that view :

What a lovely eating experience here at Faber Peak. Having travelled up by cable car and spending a few hours walking around we settled in here for some lunch. Great service with a smile, a reasonable choice and good value for money. They even had a small selection of English Badger ale to wash down my octopus salad

This used to be well run as the Jewel Box with friendly and accomodating staff. Unfortunately this is not the case any more. The new management have no idea how to treat customers ! I arrived with family for a few evening drinks and we met David the manager. They have about 30 tables of which 15 were occupied and 14 had Reserved signs on leaving 1 in the middle of the room free. All the tables with a view around the edge were Reserved. It was an unreal situation where we asked for a table with a view and the manager refused to give us any one of 14 vacant but Reserved tables with a view. We left ! We went to Faber Bistro which is 50 metres up the road and had a wonderful time spending a few hundred dollars. Sometimes some managers really have no brains !!

I liked this place because of the Bell of happiness and all the little bells around and the story that goes with it, the vibe was cool with a pond etc and it was set out very nice asides half of it was bordered off. The staff were pretty friendly and efficient. The food was full of flavour but not very big for $20! A small sandwich with a couple slices of mushroom and a couple of slices of potato was not enough for me, but was flavourful so couldnt really complain and if that's the price of sitting somewhere nice then that is fine. Handy to just hop on the cable car after eating! Also loved the happy sayings on the wall
3
The plus point about this restaurant is its location which offers great view since it is located at Mount Faber.We ordered the chicken, lamb, salmon and cod fish. The portion is sufficient and it is not fine-dining. The cutlery is placed a the table for us to help ourselves.I wish the staff can be more proactive when we were paying to inform us that we can get 15% discount with NTUC/passion or mastercard with at least $30 spent. They did not and we were not aware of it until I read the reviews on Tripadvisor
4
Loved going up here for dinner to view the spectacular sunset. Food was very good and priced right. The ride back in the sky car was great!
2
Consider this place if you are coming for a drink. The view is awesome but the food is awful. Service is ok.

The Spuds and Aprons restaurant is sited at the Faber Peak end of the Sentosa cable car and has fabulous views out over the sea and Sentosa from most seats. Two of our group were very happy with their meals, the third meal was somehat lost in translation and didn't seem the same as that written on the menu so a little disappointing
4
Good customer service started from my call in reservation few days before the day I came. The staff who pick up my call was polite and able to provide info to my queries and booking. I was disappointed knowing that live band was no longer available on Thu,Fri and Sat nights. (My reservation was for a Fri night) Staff upon knowing it was for a birthday celebration has reserved a nice seating with good view for us. She also mentioned that the staff could sing a happy birthday song to the birthday boy.(Initial plan was to dedicate a birthday song for live band to sing).I have also made a reservation for their dessert,"Jar of Happiness", to serve as a surprise after main course complete with candle and happy birthday stick on the dessert.Good food, good view and casual ambience. The staff actually gather together, about 5-6 of them, came to our table, presented the dessert with a lighted candle,happy birthday stick and sang a happy birthday song to my partner. It was indeed a nice gesture from the staff. There were also 2 other tables celebrating their birthdays there with their happy birthday song. Looking forward to my next visit soon! Tips:Do visit faberpeaksingapore, their main website to checkout current promo that they have. I saved a 15% with their current promo with either a Mastercard/NTUC/Passion card

I had high hopes for this restaurant as other similar mountain peak restaurants around the world I tried were all very premier and excellent. I was quite disappointed by the food, the service and the views here. The food - it was a weird mix of fusion food not done right. The service - we sat inside where the space was already very small but still we often had to look around for our waitress. The views - yes it was nice view overlooking the city but it doesn't have a nice angle and was partially blocked by the cable car station. After lunch we went outside and find that there's a nice lounge area and we may come here for drinks next time to check out the evening views. Otherwise I would not return for lunch again.

Yes, it's called Spuds, so expect potatoes. If you don't like them, tough.TBH, you don't come here for the food or service, but I don't really have a complaint about either. The view is outstanding. Buy a bell from the gift shop and declare your love - tie it to the post and ...Eat something. Buy a drink. Don't try to comprehend Happy Hour, even the staff don't understand it. Just enjoy.I think the staff reviews on TA are a bit overstated. I found the staff perfectly pleasant. The menu was a bit 80s, but acceptable for a tourist attraction.Overall, a relaxing and enjoyable experience
3
We were actually heading for the Faber Bistro a bit further down the road, but as we climbed the mountain thru the Faber park, the Spuds were the one we landed first. Nothing wrong with the menu per se, maybe it's a bit on the touristic side for obvious reasons. Both of our dishes were well prepared and nicely presented and the service was prompt and attentive. Nice views during sundown is certainly a bonus. Taxi down to Vivo City costs around S$6
5
Beautiful location with views across the bay. Quite something to watch the city light up as dusk falls and the cable cars sweep into the distance. We had a buffet, so I'm not sure what the service and a la carte menu are like. A bit archaic to have to buy coupons for drinks and then exchange the coupons, but I suppose there's a reason there somewhere... I would certainly recommend a visit. Loved the huge trees growing through the building..

WARNING!!!Don't try! They serve the worst drinks with terrible services! Not hospitality, no standard of drinks, and never apologize for their service shortfall! I swear I am not fussy over drinks or food but what they served are seriously terrible!!! Do not go there! It will ruin up your day if you plan to chill out there after a lovely cable car ride
1
Sitting here looking across a room of diners all desperately trying to attract the attention of the (many) waiting staff who are standing around chatting to each other. Most have resorted to getting their own menus and are now waving them in an attempt to summon anyone to take their order. I have no idea if the food or drink is any good as I have only been waiting for 30 minutes for my order to be taken so I think it would be a long night. I am off now.
2
This will be the last time that I will visit this place again. Dine here if you like the ambience but service is definitely the one factor that turns me off.
4
The restaurant is located at Mt. Faber, near the Cable Car Station. The location is perfect if you are coming from MacRitchie Trail. The view from restaurant is excellent. The food was great, delicious chili crab and variety of salads.
4
We ate here in the early evening, and they meant we could utilise happy hour up until 8pm. The chilli crab in potato skins were nice, but the main courses of pork belly and ribs were excellent. We found the service and price very good, and will return here when we come back to Singapore
1
Came here with my hubby for drink & dessert to celebrate my birthday. Reached about 9+pm and there wasn't much crowd. The only seats for gd view was only meant for big groups of at least 8. So we had no choice but to sit by the pond. And they were closing already. The service is very bad and they didn't even tell us they are closing at 11 when we were ordering. The only good point was their cocktails were nice and the dessert was special. Overall, I won't come back again

You need to do better or lose custom.....its that simple.Cable care ride was pretty cool as was the reception staff at the restaurant.We placed our order and waited and waited and waited. Had to call a waitress over to ask about our drinks.My wife's starter arrived and I said don't wait for me. Just as well since she had finished before my starter had arrived.Another 30 minute wait before my main course arrived but my wife's main no where to be seen! Anyhow, I started and had finished before wife and then the waitress brought the wrong dish which had to be returned.In the end we called over the senior waitress who could only offer a bog standard 'Sorry Lah' so I asked for the bill which we paid and left.Carry on like that folks and you will be out of business! You have an excellent location but rely totally on people using the cable car. You need to make a great impression from the on-set otherwise you will not get returning customers.The positives: Tasty food once received and the draft beer was as good as anywhere in Singapore with a fantastic location.The negatives: Still waiting for my wife's main course

We came here twice on one day during our stay in singapore. After the climb to fount faber on merang trail we were greated by lovely jessica who really did everything to make our stay a memorable one. We had some drinks and decided to return in the evening for dinner after a trip to sentosa. Jessica was so kind to reserve us a table right at the edge of the patio with wonderful view. In comparison to the afternoon the staff in the evening was not good at all! A nice waitress seemed to really try to keep up with everything, our waiter (we think jay) was just roaming around and without us showing he wouldnt have come to our table even after 40 minutes. Then we ordered, one of the dishes was not available anymore! Also, he didnt greet and just stood at our table until we ordered. If we look away from the service we loved the place. The view is amazing, the food is delicious and the milk shakes are just WOW. I had the spare ribs and they were really great, just the right kind of spicy, yummy sauce and totally tender. Also the side dish, for me and my friend the gravy fries gave you the american spirit in Singapore. In combination with the mild breeze Mount Faber had to offer a really nice evening! I would love to come again
2
After too long a wait we were able to order. The food arrived after another long wait. Unfortunately our meal was delivered to each person in our party “when it was ready” so some were eating while others were not. (Total time was over 2.5 hours.) The portions were small and the taste was very good.However, the view on the ride up and during the meal was spectacular
4
After a big walk along the Hendersons Wave and then up to Mount Faber, we came upon Spuds and Aprons Restaurant. The views were breathtaking as the Sun was setting, so decided to try some finger food, Steakhouse Spuds, Cheese and Gravy.Sounded like a weird combination but was very enjoyable. along with a couple of beers. You can catch the cable cars or add a bell for luck to the many places around the restaurant. We also found the staff to be excellent! This is a great place to end the day
5
I took my visiting mum to see the view from Mount Faber & to get some lunch at spuds n aprons. I have to say I expected more potatoes on the menu given the name! But there was plenty of choice nonetheless.I had the turkey sandwich which was lovely & had the cheese & gravy chips as a side. They were potato wedges smothered in gravy & cheese, very good although not good for the diet! Both my husband & mum had the sweet & sour fish with rice & both loved it. We sat outside with a great view over Sentosa.If you have a baby the baby change area is downstairs in the ladies by the ballroom. Go into the loos & the last stall on the right is actually the baby change area. There wasn't a nursing area do I used my cover & fed her in the restaurant.It was a very nice lunch, sandwiches are around S$8 I think the chips are S$8 and the sweet & sour was around S$12 ++ so good value.I'll return to the cafe on subsequent visits to Mt Faber
3
Cannot fault the location and view, nor the service, which was prompt and professional. I just found the food to be rather disappointing.First, they didn't have our first choice options. The portobello mushroom salad was unavailable, as was the fish and chips for kids. So, we ordered laksa, a sandwich, a kid's meal of salmon and vegetables, the serrano ham salad and the white bait salad, and chips to share. We also ordered two milkshakes.The fries were smothered in some mystery sauce that were ultimately picked at and left largely untouched. The salads were disappointingly small, and the sandwich a little dry. The laksa was not bad though.I think next time, we'll just have a coffee here
5
Great food ..............great views..............great location.................. Got to buy lucky bells to hang up for life.................. Very nice setting.............. Colourfull steps ............the restaurant is next to the cable cars..............
3
We had coffee, to kill a bit of time before returning on the cable car to Sentosa. View is OK though.
4
Wonderful table overlooking the cable cars. Caught some lunch here before heading to sentosa, definitely recommend the 'jar of happiness' - ice cream heaven in a jar! Reasonably priced, didn't open until 12pm though due to private function.
4
This is a nice little place to take in the amazing views of Singapore. Travel there bar cable car to complete the viewing experience.
Reasonably priced food and drinks can be purchased whilst enjoying the view.
5
I sat in this restaurant while my husband went up Mount Faber. The staff were super friendly, chatting to me whilst I sat there by myself. They made sure the food arrived soon after my husband did - and it was fabulous. Bearing in mind we arrived there by cable car the view was awesome, and we were not rushed to leave our table once we finished. Definitely worth a visit - you will not regret it
5
This is one of my favourite restaurants. Why? The food is really good and decently priced, has a nice ambience, nice view and the staff are friendly too. Well there's valet parking and you could also take a ride on the cable car if you would like. I love the steak, fish and berry beer. A must try
5
Took the cable car up to walk to Henderson Waves, my wife decided to sit that out in the restaurant, the staff were incredibility helpful, as I was off a little longer then planned, the kitchen was due to close at 4.30pm for an event, they cooked us food, all very friendly, and the chilly crab was the best I have had.
5
If you are spending time on Sentosa and want a break and a great lunch then hop on the cable car and head to mt Faber. Once at Mt Faber enjoy a relaxing lunch at spuds and aprons. The menu has something for everyone. Prices are very reasonable. Services is professional yet relaxed. The garden resturant has great views and a cooling breeze. Well worth a visit
5
Brought my friend over to celebrate his birthday and staffs were really friendly and helpful. We dine indoor and after that we wanted to change to outdoor to listen to the live band, staff were very helpful and offer us a lovely sofa seat outside and bring our wine bottle out for us as well. Really romantic place and price for the food was reasonable. The Crispy Pork Belly on the menu is a MUST TRY cost about $26 only
2
One thing that completely puts me off when I go to a restaurant is bad customer service. And my visit to Spuds and Apron was no different. This very impatient waiter clearly got pissed when i asked him to bring some ketchup and salt after he dropped off our sandwiches, asked me pretty rudely 'anything else?' Later, when we asked for the cheque this waitress just shouted from some distance 'just wait ya' and we waited..later i saw her lost in her phone. Finally called somebody else and paid. I urge the management to train their staff better in customer service skills because although the food was ok we had an unpleasant time. Don't think will visit again
3
My dinner there was nothing great but neither was it bad. Simply said, it is just another restaurant vis a vis food, service and ambience
2
This restaurant has a great location and atmosphere, but the quality of the food was terrible. Somebody on my table was also given a drink with three bugs in it which was taken away, strained and returned which wasn't very pleasant.
3
The Restaurant's strongest point is its good location on top of Mount Faber which gives a panoramic view of Singapore .Cable Car Station for Sentosa is is on the lower level of same building . It caters for '' where East meets West " concept with average European & Asian dishes. Service is good & prompt .For Kids , added attractions are A fish pond & a Bell to ring if you are happy 
4
My family stopped here for dinner after an excellent day on Sentosa. My husband and I shared the potato skins with chilli crab...they were amazing and the star of the show food wise. Our service was timely but unobtrusive and the setting can not be beaten. We ate inside, but I wish we had gone outside ( next time!) as it seems more relaxed and overtired kids appropriate.I have never written a review before, but felt that this place should not be missed
5
We had lunch in the restaurant and it was great.My colleagues and I had Spuds Turkey Sandwich,Soup of the day which was very tomato and seafood based and dessert was absolutely divine..The dessert sent me to cloud 9...It was known as the Jar of Happiness.I have a sweet tooth and I had to do justice to the dessert so I helped another colleague finish his portion.The staff over there were friendly and accommodating.For those of you who want to go on a date where it's quiet, this is a good spot ...Planning my trip again just for dessert!!!Yummy

Right next to the Singapore Cable Car station on Mount Faber with sweeping views of the harbor front and Sentosa island, this is a scenic setting for a meal. There's a spacious outdoor section with a small stage for a band at nights but since we were there for Sunday lunch, we chose the air-conditioned indoor section.Chili crab tux is a unique combination of chili crab topping on potato skins and cannot be missed. Crispy pork belly is delectable - Tender pork and a crispy skin together with salted vegetables. Garlic bread was a great starter too. The Hokkien noodles was authentic with succulent prawns and crispy pork lard. The sambal chilli was an excellent accompaniment. Must try desserts are the chempedak bread and butter pudding and the banana toffee trifle. Chempedak is a pungent tropical fruit, cousin of the jackfruit. I've never seen it served in this manner with bread (the chef told us he uses croissant) and butter pudding with a scoop of ice-cream - What a winner! Service was warm and friendly
4
My husband and I were there to celebrate our wedding anniversary. This was the first time we dine in this restaurant. There are two sections, one is outdoor and one is indoor. We had chosen the indoor with aircon as it was quieter. Just a few tables with a bar counter. Food was okay, although service a bit slow. Anyway, we were not in a hurry. Price of the food is also reasonable. If you want something alfresco, or to dine in natural breeze instead of aircon, then you can choose to have a table at the other section which is without aircon and has a bigger space.Overall, it is a nice place to dine in, if you go in the daytime, you will be able to see the scenery.Worth a try

Spuds & Aprons are relaticely new, as The Jewel Box is now known as Faber Peak.The menu is casual, as compared to the fine dining predecessor; with relatively reasonable prices for some amazing dishes.Blessed with an amazing atmosphere, it is easy to turn a restaurant at Mount Faber to be a huge success, if not for the inaccessibility - you will need a vehicle, or get there via the cable cars. If you finish your dinner late, waiting for a cab may take forever. That's what happened to me, and the lovely little Miss Pamela brought us to the last cable car ride to Harbourfront Centre as a form of alternative. Thank you!!!Back to the restaurant; I ordered the carrot soup (loved it), chilli crab on potato skins (the chilli crab is amazing, but the potato skins can be overwhelming and masks the crab taste), white bait salad (japanese infused, it's okay). For the mains, I had the ribeye steak (absokute perfection, it looks too amazing to eat). My wife had the cod fillet (really good).Service was good eventhough they had lots of students in their roster. I paid only $116 for such an amazing meal.I will definitely return, as with how I patronized The Jewel Box regularly before
4
Tried the lunch on a cooling afternoon. Ordered the XO fish slice noodle soup and laksa. For average $10 per dish, the price is pretty reasonable, however taste of the food 'nothing to shout for'. When ordered, was told it will take 20mins which was a bit long. However did enjoy the nice ambience
1
The service was absolutely shocking. 10+ staff should be able to run a place twice the size comfortably.The one for one pints of beer are not in pint glasses as advertised on the menu. I think that these issues Stem from senior management having no idea!Anonymous, 10 years hospitality management experience.
