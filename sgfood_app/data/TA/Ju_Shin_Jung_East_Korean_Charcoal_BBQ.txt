Decent place to get some Korean food the staff is very helpful and help you out patiently with the menu will repeat this place

Price of food has been trending upwards lately. But charging $2.50 for a regular bowl of plain short grain rice is way too exorbitant. And an additional $1 for a wet towel.
Quality of food is acceptable but be wary of the 'extras'

Saw this Korean restaurant after my trip to Haw Paw Villa. Decided to give it a try. We choose 4 dishes and it's delicious with quite a big portion. Love the side dishes which have a dessert as well ( I not sure what it is). Friendly staff and best of all, I find the tissue towel interesting. Why? It's compressed and become big when u drip a few drops of water. The price is reasonable for a restaurant but alcoholic beverages a bit pricey.

My local friend and his family invited me to this restaurant on Friday night - went straight from Changi airport after arriving from Perth 30 or so minutes earlier.It is located at 102 Guillemard Rd near the old badminton centre.We had the all you can eat BBQ for four adults and two kids - the chosen meats were barbequed by the kids after the helpful staff led the way. Our table had two BBQ pits which meant we never ran out of cooked meat and the friendly waitresses brought out additional meats as required.We also enjoyed the soups - I had the spicy tofu - just right.The sides and sauces were great - particularity the crispy sweet seaweed - it was a real re-fresher after the sauces and other sides.To finish the night we each had an orange quarter and a sweet drink to offset all other spices and tastes...they topped off the meal.There are many price options - good lunch deals - you can dine to your budget or splurge a bit.If you want to something different this place will do

A great experience for us as Australians only haven eaten Korean in Adelaide. Hugh serves with so many side dishes. Great flavours to dip and accompany the meat. BBQ at the table very quickly and with out fuss or smoke. Loved the hand wipes! We thought they were peppermints but add water and hey presto! Wet hand wipes.Robertson Walk has fantastic food options so try it.

Not really my style of restaurant but colleagues convinced me to accompany them. I guess if you like Korean BBQ then you may enjoy. Personally I found the food to be very average and the service very average also. The prices are on the expensive side for an average lunch

Went there to fix our bbq craving. Place had quite a few tables despite it only being 6pm on a weekday when we got there. Went for the 'buffet' which was about $35/pax. That came with at least 5 cuts of meat and a dish of your choice (soup/rice/noodles). We picked the cold noodles and bibimpbab. Servers were patient enough to run through some of the sides that arrived and that we weren't sure of. With the sides, they bring sooooo many that it fills the entire table!! Loved it!! It was a bit awkward while they're grilling the meat cuz we couldn't wait to get tucked in, but were happy nibbling on the sides. The meat quality wasn't great, so just on that note, it was a bit of a let down. Not sure if it's real value for money even though the price/pax is reasonable.Will we be back? 6.5/10 I guess.

We tried Dolsot Bibimbap with chicken and Buchujeon with shrimps and a bottle of Bokbunjajoo!!! Service was good and the food was authentic and tasty it was well paired with the Bokbunjajoo. Enjoyed but we had less time for a relaxed dinner as we entered very late

This is not the best Korean BBQ in Singapore but the only one on Upper East Coast. We live nearby so we come here.Food quality is good, service a bit slow but still ok.Usually they have an unlimited BBQ at night which is a lot of meat for an ok price. Tonight 31.12.2015 they don't serve this but we stay because we are hungry. This means that it was going to be expensive today. We paid S$ 308.25 for 4 people, inclusive of one bottle of Soju Korean rice wine.Better call before coming here next time, to check out whether the unlimited BBQ is available.Or else go downtown for a better Korean BBQ

We were actually looking for HooHa at West coast road but it was closed not sure why...and JSJ was next to it and the family said they don't mind trying Korean bbq food for dinner. We ordered the family set for 4 pax (there were 5 of us). Added a wagyu beef and a steam egg.Food was just nice for 5 of us and we could not finish the salad and veg.There are 2 types of seating. One on floor like Japanese but unfortunately there is no hole in the floor at the centre of the table for legs:(...be prepared to feel cramped in the legs after a while. It will be worst for guest who are heavier and in long pants. We were all in t shirt and shorts. The other seating arrangements is sit down tables with chairs. As we were walk in diners we had no choice but take the floor tables. There was definitely more than enough feed from the sat fir 5 of us. The wagyu beef was really standard. The place was crowded with plenty of young families. There was even a kids playground inside to keep kids entertained. Service was ok and the staff grilled and cooked our food. One thing all of us did after we reached home after the meal waa to take a good shower and wash our hair. We smell of Korean bbq...

This place on East Coast Parkway is huge, but not very well taken care of. The food is OK, the restaurant doesn't offer lots of choices. The service is good.
5
Attentive and hospitable staff. Spacious location with facilities for children.
Heart-warming korean recipes, unlimited refill of kimchi.
Don't miss the great selection of korean rice wine

Huge size of grand hall, Friendly staff, nice food and handsome boss.^^

A long standing korean restaurant, opened by a korean but now ran by Filipinos and Chinese and same Vietnam, BUT the food still maintains its standards but still on the high side. This place is huge thus you'll be spared from the choking smoke found in other smaller places. Private rooms and ample parking makes this place one of my fav in the East.

Went there for lunch with family. We ordered bbq beef, bbq pork and saba set. Enjoyed the food and side dishes. Side dishes were a bit localised (no anchovies but there was lettuce with thousand island sauce). Comfortable with the service and spacious setting. Ginger tea at the end was a good touch. Overall good experience

We love this restaurant and visit them few times a year for lunch. Although they serve similar set lunch menu as the West Coast branch, the food at West Coast tasted better. We have been to West Coast branch quite a few times and this was our 2nd visit in East Coast branch. In our 2 visits here, we found our favourite beef bone broth to be somehow bland as compared to West Coast branch.Service here is also not as good as West Coast branch. Here when you ask for refill of side dishes, there was a feeling of reluctance from the staff. Not in West Coast though.We have decided since this visit that we will only go to West Coast branch

Almost a week in Singapore before we found this place! It's thebezt food we've eaten here so far! Excellent quality fresh food, preparation, presentation and sublimely delicious! The staff are professional and attentive but very friendly. The premises are immaculate ... everything is so clean and sparkly.....and the value? Keep it a secret but it's underpriced!!! We are going back again tonight! Our first introduction to Korean food but we've already told all our friends and family in Australia aniut this place. Thanks!

We booked for 10pax dining on 9th Oct 2014 for the Korean Charcoal BBQ buffet @ Robertson Walk for the deals that we have purchased from deal.com.sg.This is not my first time patronizing Ju Shin Jung and I've had many great experiences with the outlet at Joo Chiat, then Guillemard Road. This is the first and final time that I'd be going to Robertson Walk; if not for the fresh and big bodied prawns provided.We were shown to our table promptly upon arrival and we ordered our soups that comes with the buffet. The vegetables and appetizers were already on the table when we arrived (okay, we're cool with that) but it sure takes a longgggg time for our meats and soups to arrive. It took approximately 30minutes for 1 plate of chicken and prawns to reach us (with repeated reminders) and 1hour plus for 1 single bowl of rice. Not to mention that they totally forgot one of my friend's cold soba until an hour plus later... or that they have no brown rice drink.Like hello, I thought it's a staple? Then they tell my friend it's the last bottle of Dasani plain water we can get at the table despite listing FREE drinks and that's like 4-5 bottles of 1.5litres shared among 10 people who are feeling hot and humid in the enclosed area; with the charcoal BBQ.I find that ridiculous.First, if you're listing free flow - you shouldn't be limiting. Secondly, if you do have limits you should mention it in the first place when we arrive. Thirdly, you cannot serve the basics (quality of service + staple like brown rice drink) then you shouldn't bother doing deals online. You're just testing your own limits and tarnishing your own reputation if you can't serve up.I'm not even asking for exceptional service but basic order taking and they didn't even bother to ask if anyone needs rice (nobody in the group had a clue until I insisted it is part of the set and asked the waitress) before the order was taken and served an hour plus later (again, after repeated reminders).With that long of a story I thought I'd summarize here.Quality of Service: Bad (Order taking fail, Serving time is long and you get all kind of restrictions not restricted at other outlets)Quality of Food: Other meats were average but prawns were exceptionally fresh and big bodied. Good value for that and vegetables were fresh. Appetizers weren't very exceptional at this outlet. Spicy tofu soup is okay.Ambience: Mostly working professionals and friends meeting up after work. More crowded than other outlets and yes, more smoky too due to the charcoal BBQ.Would I come back again? Hell no, if I have to pay for this kind of service level. I'd much better go other outlets like West Coast and Guillemard Road

Been here many times. The kids love the beef rib soup. Set lunches are value for money. Pleasantly surprised to be offered brown rice the last time we went, but not available today. We were also told by a Chinese waitress today that side dishes were no longer free flow. First set comes with the meal and if you need more, the side dishes are chargeable. Without free flow of side dishes, we are not likely to frequent this place as often as before

This restaurant was recommended by a great friend of mine who passed on recently. She is a lady with a discerning taste for food, so if she said the food was good, it must be of a high standard. This is my second visit to the place. Service is still so good. Staff are attentive and efficient.I ordered my favourite saba fish which came with rice, free flow of korean side dishes and dessert.There were about 8 types of tasty side dishes for us to eat till our heart content. The fish was succullent and the seasoning was just right. The heart-shaped watermelon was sweet and heart warming. But the extremely sweet cinnamon tea may come as a shock for some people. The value lunch is really value for money and it is available every day, including. Really worth trying

I always like BBQ food and the meat is really delicious.
Its way too overpriced. One plate of meat (few slices) cost $30s is way way too much.
If you like BBQ and dont mind paying for expensive meat, worth a try.

The food is so so and the price steep. More catered for tourists. There are better and cheaper Korean food around. Will not recommend this place. No personal touch.

We have eaten here a few times and enjoy the food. I especially enjoyed the raw beef, kimchi pancakes and kimchi noodle soup. Do order the yoghurt at the end of your meal.. Perfect balance of tangy and tart!

Maybe I wasn't in the best mood coming to a Korean BBQ after the scorching heat of the Singapore Airshow, but still, I've enjoyed much finer Korean food than this. This restaurant is large - on the second floor of a complex in East Coast Park. Very kid friendly, they have a tiny area with some play things for the little ones, and the staff understand kids are running around. But the food was quite mediocre, at least when compared to the upper end of Korean BBQ restaurants. We had lots of beef which just seemed a bit dry and lifeless. Staff were a bit clueless at times, and the bathroom was fairly unpleasant - especially with one toilet (stall, that is). Anyway, a nice place, try it once, maybe you'll enjoy more than we did - but don't go a second, there are plenty of better Korean options in Singapore

We were on our way to Tanjong Pagar to satisfy our craving for some good Korean food. Seeing a 'Heavy Traffic' alert on ECP after Marine Parade, we decided to take a detour and try our luck at Ju Shin Jung Charcoal BBQ. The look and feel from outside gave us the impression that we were in for something really awesome. There was somebody on the ground floor to greet, show the menu and direct us to the second floor, where the restaurant is located. It seemed a bit pricey overall, but we felt like paying a bit extra for some exquisite barbecued meat on a Friday evening. With a deep sense of pride in having pulled off a great Plan B, we climbed the stairs to arrive at the entrance of the restaurant. Oops - we felt like we were in a giant food court rather than a restaurant. I did not even bother to check how many seats they had - it was the size of a big auditorium. Very child friendly though - there is even a small cosy play corner for the kids. The disappointment continued as we flipped through the pages of the menu. There is an option for unlimited bbq for 29++ on Mondays to Thursdays, unfortunately not on Fridays and weekends. Everything else looked pricey and we were forced to order a minimum of 2 bbq items. Finally after an intense discussion, we accepted our misfortune and decided to eat here. We ordered some garlic beef, marinated chicken and kimchi pancake. The quality of meat was not that great. Sides were below par compared to a good Korean restaurant. However, I have to mention that the service was good. Friendly staff who provide good recommendations and grill the meat at your table the way you like. We paid around 110$ for 2 pax without any alcohol. Overall, an overpriced tourist trap.Never again

This is a reasonably large restaurant serving comprehensive range of authentic Korean Dishes because it is popular among the Korean community living or working in Singapore. Menu includes set buffet BBQ menu. Even Wagyu beef is available .They have a set lunch menu at $9.90 ++ which comes with a main dish of your choice with brown or white rice with soup. Tea and water. The lunch comes with a full set of Korean appetisers or condiments like kimchi and many side dishes. It is excellent value for money as ambience and quality is excellent at fast food or hawker prices

The food's mediocre (had the garlic beef sirloin which was disappointing and poorly cooked; marinated pork which was better but still not great; and kimchi pancake which was bland). The ginger cinnamon tea served at the end was nice, but not enough to salvage the meal. Service was pleasant. Will not go back again

Went to this place for a birthday treat. I like Korean food and have been to a few like Manbok, Seoul Kitchen, Amara Hotel's so should be able to share on the comparison.1. Location - is good for those who are residing in east or people who go to east coast park for activities. They also have one in the west of Singapore. Not very accessible unless you drive. There is no MRT and only 1 or 2 bus services to the area. Located in an old building so it does come across seedy compared to it's neighboring Waraku standalone restaurant.2. Food - however the food does make up for it. We ordered a seafood and veg pancake, kimchi jijae, thin pork belly slices and short rib boneless beef. This is sufficient for 3 persons -2ladies and 1 guy. The kimchi jijae is softer in taste, not too acidic since there are tomato added and I like it since it tasted authentic. The seafood pancake has a good level of egg flavor as many other places tend to cut back on eggs and use alot more flour instead. Generous with seafood but the squid to prawn ratio is not balanced...too many prawns! The meat is also fresh and 180g beef cost less than 40 & 28 for thin pork slices. One of the cheapest and tasted ok. Many sides dishes served per typical Korean fare.3. Service - friendly staff who is constantly checking if you need more things. They appear in front of you when you any request and this happens rather instantaneously which is good and yet they ard not too pushy. They also help us BBQ our meats. I like the way they are building their business.4. Value - good for value since we spent less than 120 for 4 persons. 5. The atmosphere is a bit lacking though. The ventilator is strong but we still left with a slight cooking smell. The seats are also strategically placed wrongly. The seats were designed to be immovable nearer to the table. We were sitting with half our butts sticking out. That's the low down of this place.

Being a Korean, I pretty much make a point of checking out every Korean restaurant in Singapore. This is one of the worst. It seems to cater for mass group tourists. Food is mass produced, no delicate balances of taste, presented poorly too. Practically no service. The only good thing about this place is that it's easy to park

This place is NOT cheap but you expect that with Korean BBQs. I have been a couple of times previously but I can’t help feeling that the whole thing is on a downward slide.The side dishes were plentiful but quality mediocre.The meats were not of the quality I have seen here before, the beef in particular left a bit to be desired. The pork collar was ok.The waitress was a bit hopeless to be honest and though she tried her best she hadn’t got much clue on how to barbecue, burned or not done was order of the day.There are better choices to be honest
