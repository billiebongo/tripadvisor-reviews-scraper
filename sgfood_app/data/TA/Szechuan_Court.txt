The quality of food is excellent. However the restaurant opens on the dot. My family arrived early for dinner and needed to wait for it to open at exactly 630pm
4
Food was good and
Had variety and offers at lunchtime
Kind of noisy though there were "cubicles seats"
3
Food dishes not worth the price in terms of ingredients and quantity. Not enough service staff as usual though its a quiet Sat afternoon at 1pm. Would not visit if there's no discount.
4
Very nice and exquisite place for dim sum. It’s abit pricy, but worth the value for the ambience and service.
3
Waited quite awhile for food to be served. Probably it’s due to the lunch crowd. Nevertheless, the OCBC bank 25% discount for total food bill was a good marketing tactic, which could explain why the restaurant was packed when we visited.
3
Dinner was simple and not too bad as usual. Not crowded so was good. One of the better decorated Szechuan restaurant in town.
4
The ambience was cosy and nice but I would think the food portion abit on the lesser side. Otherwise, the food were tasty and Santa visited the restaurant since its a Christmas Eve. Overall, it was a good dining experience.
5
The Lunar New Year period is usually busy for Chinese restaurants. But for the staff at Szechuan Court, they were as attentive to my needs as ever. It was also a family lunch to celebrate my Mum's birthday, and the staff went the extra mile to ensure that we were well taken care of. The food was also as great as I remember from my previous visits
4
Just had a great dinner experience at the restaurant and was served by Qui Hui who guided us well to our choices and serving size as well as a new trainee Rubby who did a great job despite only starting a few days ago.Under the watchful eye of John Ong the Manager of the restaurant this place excels with excellent food , great warm service and located conveniently at the Raffles Shopping Centre. Highly recommended for good Chinese food

Since Szechuan Court is included in Amex Love Dining promotion, thought to give it a try for a dinner. Ordered Braised Soon Hock fish dry pot, XO Wok Fried Sliced Beef and Ginger Fried Rice but non of these food were appealing. All were bland, cold, tasteless and oily. Service was very slow and staff were inattentive. Thanks to Amex promotion I got 50% off the bill, but even that was not worth it
4
This is my regular go to restaurant for food comfort food. The food is well suited to my palate. Service staff is attentive. Nice amd soothing ambience to have a quiet dinner with family.
4
Yummy food. Deboned smoked duck was definitely our top pick. An overpriced restaurant but as we were staying at the Swissotel we got a 30% discount. Worth a visit for the duck alone!
3
Had the set dinner . Food not fantastic only on average. Prices are very expensive . Food took too long to serve . Service staff are not attentive . Overall average service and food
5
I love their service and recently I have noticed that the quality of the food is improving. The food used to be average and sometimes the dim sum served cold, now its good and hot!
5
Love the Peking duck, the pan seared pork collar and many more! It's a restaurant that will make me come back for more!
4
I’ve always liked the restaurant as it serves up consistently good food. This time round, they had new items for dim sum. And it is long overdue. I brought my colleagues there and they loved the food. But more importantly, the service has improved tremendously. The food and drinks all came promptly without much fus
4
Certainly pleased to experience an improved service @ Szechuan Court Kitchen. Additionally, I noticed a slightly improved of food presentation ! I particularly enjoyed the new dim sum item ‘lychee fresh prawn wafer paper rolls’, as well as my all time favourite ‘wanton with Szechuan pepper & chilli oil’... Orders were taken, foods were served & bill was fetched efficiently! A fuss-less & quick lunch over a reasonably priced dim sum with Amex Love Dining promo
4
If you’re looking for a version of the iconic cereal prawn dish that goes down easy (ie prawns are de-shelled), look no further! Szechuan Court’s cereal prawns give the most bang for the buck with its amazing flavour and option for small, medium and large servings. If you can’t get enough of prawns, do try the prawns with salted egg sauce which is another amazing dish. Pair either or both of these with egg fried rice for a great gastronomic experience. Downside - service is a bit slow, which is the only reason they get four stars; otherwise the food in general tastes soooo good
4
Great dining experience. The food is of much higher quality and standard compared to other di m sum buffet. A little pricy but is worth trying. Did not manage to try all varieties yet due to small stomach we have. Will be good to go in bigger groups so you may just get a chance to try every so for dishes in the menu.
3
I came here last week for lunch with a friend and to make use of a deal which gave us 50% off dim sum. The food was nice enough but it's not cheap - our bill would have been more than $100 for a simple dim sum lunch for 2 with no alcohol if we didn't have the 50% off deal. There's no way I would come here at full price
4
Have always enjoyed my meals at Szechuan Court. This time is no different. Food & service are up to expectations. Will definitely be back again soon!
4
Food quality was good but not many choices for single person serving. Believe the restaurant was understaffed but they tried to be as attentative as possible.
4
Service was great, despite short of staff. Food standard not bad. Suggest their poultry dishes, they taste great!
4
Good quality Szechuan cuisine and a reasonable price. A convenient location for gatherings. FAR card privileges is a must for this place.
4
The stir fried spinach is v good and the roast duck was excellent! But they really should change out the depressing er hu music
4
This restaurant situated on the 2 floor of the Fairmont hotel is a great place to eat. When you walk in you are greeted with a smile and led to a wonderful table which is well set out. The menu is extensive however we tried the Szechuan beef with peppercorns and it was such a delight. It is hot so be careful but all the other food we had was superb
5
Final night in Singapore and we were really mad at ourselves for not going to the Court earlier .5 of us dined and no one was disappointed , one of our friends travels considerably for business and rated his meal as memorable ,We share a number of dishes from BBQ pork to garlic sprouts
5
Everything was fine until the staff portioned the dish with one serving short, leaving one diner without a bowl of soup. The staff was quick to respond by instructing the kitchen to prepare another portion for the diner at no extra charge, which was served some 20 minutes later. Other than that, the food was spicy and full of flavour, as you would expect from any restaurant serving Szechuan cuisine
4
The Dim Sum is consistently good. But the menu has be around for some time. They used to introduce new and creative Dim Sum dishes from time to time but it has too long since the last time. And the service standard has dropped. We went there at 1.30pm, thinking that since it was late, service would be prompt but it wasn't the cas
3
I ordered their signature fried rice, szechuan chicken, claypot braised soon hock, fish noodles and black sesame paste with glutinous rice ball. The fried rice was too oily, and not enough egg. The dessert was a disappointment, I think I can get better ones at much cheaper value. The fish noodles were the best
2
Food was ok. Service? Had to wave a few times to get waiters to come. May not patronise again.
Please up your service standard.
4
If dining with 5 pax this place is value for money on Mondays. Good food, service and 50% discount with FAR membership.
3
We normally order the steam soon hock which is usually fresh and well cooked. Friday nights are always crowded so maybe service suffers a bit
4
This restaurant had delicious food. The serves are quite small so you should order 3 mains to share for a couple. The staff were excellent.
4
Had a delicious Dim Sum feast with my Wife. The Dim Sum quality is consistent and reasonably priced.
5
we went to the Szechuan Court Restaurant on our last night in Singapore, food is always top and great service. We had the prawns in cereal, prawns juicy and tender, Hot and Sour Soup was spot on, not too spicy, but enough to stir the tastebuds.Roast Duck was so juicy and tender, a must try dish. Definitely worth a visit
1
Szechuan Court has been a consistently good Chinese restaurant for years, BUT NO MORE!Every year until last year, I hosted my friends and family for seventh day dinner. During the rest of the year I would come here the rest of the year just to eat their house special tea smoked duck. This place used to have friendly, knowledgeable service staff and really good chefs in the kitchen, BUT THEY'RE ALL GONE . Went this week and ordered tea smoked duck plus some side dishes for two. Instead of tea smoked duck they served us plain roast duck. I sent it back and asked for the tea smoked duck. After 15 minutes the manager came and gave me the lame excuse that, according to the chef, the problem was with the five spice marinade they use so all the duck they have will taste the same. Hmmm, don't know whether the chef didn't know how to actually make smoked duck, or was too lazy, and didn't want to be bothered making the house special smoked duck but either way they don't serve it anymore despite the fact that it's still on the menu. Added to the fact that the restaurant manager didn't know that the smoked flavor and aroma comes from actually smoking the duck, not from the marinade, I cancelled the order and paid for the vegetables and rice that had already been served. I also have taken Szechuan Court off my list of favorite Chinese restaurants in Singapore and suggest you do the same. Good thing Hua Ting and Jian Nang (see my reviews of these places in Trip Advisor) are still making great meals, as are many, many other places.
3
My last visit to Szechuan Court was almost 5 years ago and the place left a very good impression with me. The ambience was nice and the food was good. This time round I felt the food was not as fantastic as before, especially the spicy and sour soup, which did not have as much ingredients as before and the taste also changed. A bit disappointed by that. We also tried braised spicy beef, which was quite good, then got disappointed again by the braised soon hock in HK style as there was barely any taste of the fish.
4
My husband and I have been looking for a restaurant that serves cereal prawns with the prawns already de-shelled and we can across this restaurant at Fairmont. Their cereal prawn dish was super yummy. We also tried their prawns in salted egg sauce, honey barbecued pork, kailan veggie in soy-based sauce and egg fried rice. It was a really satisfying meal. Since then, it has become our go-to place for cereal prawn. A bit pricey but worth the dollars in my opinion
4
A wide range of Chinese foods were available.Had mixed portion of roasted Pork and duck which were okay.Enjoyed the fried prawn with wasabi.My favorite was the hot and sour soup. Room decoration was great and appealing. They have some selections of teas and special teas which of great tastes too.I went there twice. First was for dinner and the latter for a Sunday dimsum lunch. Both were great.Highly recommended
3
Think due to shortage of staff...service is a little slow. Otherwise food is ok,. Book thru Chope and have my seat as per my request.
4
Can feel the sincerity in their cooking. Love their peanut chicken dish. Addictive. Good with szechuan peppers.
4
Food was authentic and ambience was great. Get either the booth seats of corner seats for more privacy. Service was exceptional as per the food. Nothing to pick on at all except that it's a little pricey!
5
I enjoyed the sweet and sour fried chicken. The long beans and tauhu tasted good too! Portion is quite small but service is great.
4
food was great, but the feel of the place was underwhelming. it was noisy and a bit too casual for a restaurant in a hotel. service was great though
4
Authentic chinese food (especially peking duck) and friendly service. Highly recommended for dining!
3
Usually service during weekend is not prompt but last Sat, 17 June was exceptional good. Food is good but portion is small.
5
My wife and I frequent Szechuan Court for many years and hosted a number of celebrations including birthday party. We like the ancient door at the entrance, sitting arrangement (with window seats) and four seaters with wooden partition and rarely now they serve tea using a long nose tea pot.We recommend for 3 to 4 persons to order a cold plate (roasted pork, roasted duck and char siew or jelly fish), sweet and sour soup (authentic Szechuan style) or live prawn herbal soup, half fried chicken, claypot sea cucumber with muchroom, fried pepper beef and spinach and fried seafood noodle
2
When we arrived at 1250 for a 1300 reservation, the staff at the entrance tried to seat a couple who apparently didn't have reservations at the entrance of the restaurant. When the couple declined the table, we overheard the staff saying she will swap their tables with someone else who apparently already had a reservation.When it came to our turn, she tried to seat us at the very same table that the earlier couple declined. This made it apparent to us that she had given up our table to the earlier couple, although she denied it. When we declined this table she gave us a table further inside. Still it disturbed us greatly that staff at this restaurant give up tables that have already been reserved for other guests.This restaurant is also WOEFULLY UNDERSTAFFED. The waiter at our section gave us EXCELLENT service, but he was so busy running around serving tables (and at one point carving and serving Peking Duck) that some of the guests started opening drawers and cupboards to help themselves to bowls, cutlery and condiments.Fairmont should really stop skimping on manpower costs and start providing us with service befitting the price, instead of this deplorable service they are now providing
4
Made a reservation for lunch. Was surprised that the place had quite a crowd for weekday, so it was a bit of problem of getting the staffs' attention. There's booth tables by the window. Nice but a tab shiny. Showed to a table near the booth tables with a good view of outside. Started with Wild Chrysanthemum Tea ($4++/ per person). There was a la carte dim sum for lunch during weekday.Steamed Pork Ribs, Preserved Vegetables 榨菜蒸排骨 ($7.80++)The pork ribs was fat and juicy but the surprise turned to be the preserved vegetables who tasted sweet instead of the usual spicy and salty. Crystal Spinach Dumpling 水晶菠菜饺 ($6.80++/ 3 pieces)The skin was very thin and chewy. One could easily see the filling inside the clear looking skin. Crabmeat Fresh Prawn Dumpling 蚧肉鲜竹卷 ($8.80++/ 3 pieces)It looked and tasted like the typical har gow.Steamed Mushroom Siew Mai 北菇蒸卖 ($7.80++/ 3 pieces)The taste was average. Like the popping effect of the prawn roes.Chinese Sausage Glutinous Rice, Baked Cod Fillet, Homemade Barbecued Sauce 烧汁鳕鱼腊味饭 ($8.80++)The dish was beautifully decorated with a flower, when served. The plain looking rice was savoury in taste, although one could not see any sausage in it. The cod was juicy and flavourful.Rum and Raisin Egg White Tart 朗姆酒提子挞 ($7.80++/ 3 pieces)The tiny tart was simply melt in the mouth and gone in a mouthful.Pan-fried Radish Cake, Dried Shrimp, Chinese Sausage 香煎罗卜糕 ($6.80++/ 3 pieces)Prettily decorated with flowers. Not bad in texture and taste.Lean Meat Century Egg Congee 皮蛋瘦肉粥 ($14++)Plain looking but very savoury and smooth with shredded dried scallop in it. A sight that it had been cooked for long hours.Chilled Jelly Fish, Wild Mushroom, Szechuan Pepper Sauce 川辣野菇海蜇 ($16++/ small)It was spicy and crunchy.Chilled Pork Belly, Garlic Soya Sauce 蒜泥白肉 ($20++/ small)Savoury and tender.Chef's Soup of the Day 老火烈汤 ($12++)It was Pork Ribs with Lotus Root. The pork ribs was very tender and juicy. The soup was very flavourful.Almond Cream with Snow Fungus 生磨杏仁雪耳 ($10++)The mixture was smooth and not too sweet.Creamy Black Sesame, Peanut Glutinous Rice Ball 香滑芝麻糊汤圆 ($10++)Rich and creamy, without too sweet.Chilled Coconut Jelly Cake, Black Glutinous Rice Cream 椰汁紫米糕 ($12++/ 3 pieces)Refreshing and creamy in taste
4
had the sunday dim sum in a booth. was full and tables turned twice. food was great but took along time to arrive. suggest ordering everything at once and expect 20-30 minutes. waiter was very good but overworked. they need more waiters.
4
The dishes at szechuan court were awesome, especially the differnet peking duck combinations and desserts :)
5
Had a 600g soon hock, steamed teow chew style. Fish was exceptionally fresh. Staff was most obliging to our request for additional coriander and other dietary requirements.
4
Pleasant menu with many familiar dishes and plenty of opportunity to spice things up. Specialist teas are a nice extra touch, and local desserts are a great way to finish the meal.
3
Took advantage of 50% FAR privilege on Mondays. However the food was so so only. We had French Bean which tasted old and braised Soon shock which had more bone than meat. Overall ok only for the 50%.
5
A fine dine place with one of the best Szechuan and Cantonese cuisine in Singapore. Loved the fish preparation as well as the crispy chicken with pepper and peanuts. And off course, the mango desserts. Pricey and so a place for dinner on special occasions.
3
TimSum range was limited. Price is relatively more expensive than normal chinese restaurant. Otherwise overall is good.
4
@TheKuoKnowsIt has "Szechuan" in its name. But don't underestimate the restaurant's ability to pack a punch in the Cantonese arena.The first thing that strikes you about Szechuan Court is the outstanding decor. How much did it spend in decking out the place? But it's well worth it. The comfortable surroundings greatly enhances the entire dining experience.The Winter Melon Soup can be a good way to start the meal. It's very flavoursome. A three-way combination of Roast Pork, Roast Duck and Char Siu can provide a good stop-gap to a selection of well-made Dim Sum, if you want.Szechuan Court can certainly steam fish. The Soon Hock is at the slightly less expensive end of the price list, but no less delicious.Szechuan Court, with its attentive staff and great cuisine gets the nod of approval from me
5
We were here with a party of ten and they accommodated us well at a round table. The service was attentive and the food was delicious. We ordered ten rounds of dim sum that included pork, shrimp and veggie. All the dumplings were tasty and well made. I'd definitely come back here
2
A disappointing representation of Szechuan food. Tried the chef's recommendations of the braised beancurd in hot sauce (a.k.a mapo tofu) and the ChongQing fried chicken, as well as the hot and sour soup and the cod braised with Szechuan chilli pepper. All the dishes were technically well executed and the textures were good. However, with the exception of the soup, they did not taste of the layered and complex flavours that I expect from Szechuan food.Additionally, one of the main reasons for my visit was the "Handicraft" Chinese tea where part of the experience was to watch the tea leaves unfold. It was served in a small teapot and, I guess, so slowly, that the leaves have already filled the pot's capacity when it arrived on the table
3
my friends and i werr sufficiently happy with the quality of the food which was tasty and fairly creative. however, the bill.of over $160 for simply dim sum for four pax is rather steep and unexpected. way too expensive for normal fare.
3
Food not bad. Short of manpower. Staff are often rushing. Hope to try more different types of szechuan & hunan dishes.
3
Peking duck not bad. Should try their Tim sum & sichuan cuisine. Short of manpower. Expect slower service.
4
If you're looking for Chinese cuisine when visiting Raffles City or staying over at Fairmont Hotel, there is only this. Fortunately the restaurant does an excellent job dishing out its blend of Szechuan and Cantonese cuisine. We usually drop by when in the vicinity to enjoy the privacy of the booth seats. We enjoyed our quiet dinner with orders of smoked duck, flat rice noodles, and several live seafood and claypot dishes. The live prawns poached in a herbal broth were fresh and sweet. The steamed fish was executed perfectly, allowing the soft flesh to flake off easily. The braised sea cucumber had a rich brown sauce and the smoked duck was tender to the bite. The flat rice noodles were silky and slurpy. Service was friendly and helpful despite the low staff-to-guest ratio. They toned down the heat on certain dishes and delivered a slower pace of food service as per our request.
4
It's my favorite place when it comes to dim sum. They constantly change their menu with their own concoctions. I don't usually order the traditional dim sum. I like it when a restaurant create their own. And this restaurant has enough to keep me coming back for more. The service this time unfortunately wasn't great. The last dish took more than 20 mins to arrive after several reminders. Probably because they were full that day. But still not a good excuse. They need to improve on this aspec
3
Fairly large restaurant close to Fairmont hotel and Raffles City. I found the room a bit soulless.Menu options what you would expect in a Chinese restaurant. I really like spicy Szechuan food but the chicken dish I had, (I was advised it was spicy), was 25% to 40% chilli and it was really spicy.Overall I found this place expensive fro what it offered 
4
The service was top notch and most dishes were of excellent quality especially the roast duck and steamed fish but we were disappointed they ran out of soon hock on our last visit. The er hu background music should really changed, we kept yawning because of it.
4
Had lunch today at Szechuan Court. The restaurant was rather crowded. What amazed me was the service rendered by Ms Janet Fong. She was ever so calm and cheerful despite having to attend to so many diners.Food-wise, it was acceptable except that they were a little salty. There's always room for improvement.engelano
5
Went for dim sum with my daughter and a friend. Though the variety of the dim sum is limited but the quality of the food and service is very good. Hope there will be more varieties on the menu in future. Will definitely come back again.
4
The food is fantastic. Only thing is they charge us the appetizers by the number of pay. 4 person charge 6 dollars in total for 2 pickles. The portion is same if 2person at the table which charge 3 dollars. Make no sense, will request for no appetizers for my next visi
3
Food are delicate but not so Szechuan style. The restaurant is neat and clean but the space is not that big.
4
Good quality food. Nice ambience. Tea is a bit expensive. Staff need more training to handle customers' enquiries.
4
The excellent service more than made up for the slightly overpriced CNY menu. All in all it was a good experience.
4
Had dim sum, soup, tried the chicken with peanut sauce (starter) & ChungQing chicken (main), very tasty but can be spicy. Expect a little wait for food.
4
always a pleasure to have a meal here. the restaurant service is very good but the kitchen can be a little slow,
5
We went to Szechuan Court for the dim sum ala carte buffet for the first time and were impressed by the quality of the food and excellent service. We will defnitely be back for more!
4
Had Chinese New Year Dinner at Szechuan Court. Food was great from large abalone to steamed Galoupa fish. The place is quite cozy but a little cramp. Service that night was a little bit slow and below my expectation. I have given this review a for star because of the quality of the food. Situated within Fairmont hotel, this one is a hidden gem not to miss.
5
Ate here while staying at the Fairmont. Unlike previous reviewers, we found the service good and we did not have to wait too long for the food. We started with a mild chicken dish which was delicious followed by king prawns and asparagus then beef tenderloin both of which were cooked to perfection. Would go back again. The restaurant had many Chinese people dining there which is always a good sign. There are many banquets on the menu but none for two.
3
We ate a simple dinner here for my birthday. A soup each , and then some young spinach in oyster sauce, roast pork and rice. All of which were very good. The service was more than adequate but not exceptional. We also had fine white tea which was $10 per person ... don't think I have EVER spent $20 on tea for two before ... Overall a good simple meal IF it was half the price
4
Located at city hall, this elegant dining place is easily accessible. They have wide range of food on the menu for you to choose, from the authentic Szechuan hot and cold starters and main course, to the Cantonese BBQ delights, you will definitely find your favourite. I like their seafood dishes, very fresh and tastes good. One of my must-have dishes during my visit is "Braised cod, fried garlic, black fungus, 'bai Ye' beancurd! The cod and vege are served in a super sweet fish broth, very light yet flavourful dish, thumbs up
4
Had Sunday lunch here. Overall, not a bad experience. We had 10 different types of dim sum. They were served hot. A vast improvement from previous occasion
4
Have not been here for quite awhile and felt very nostalgic that the food still taste so good and authentic. Enjoyed ourselves very much!
2
The hot n sour soup starchy, tasteless. Vegetables too much salt. Service alright, ambience relaxing n well spaced. May not patronize.
1
Food Ok, service was dreadful and very exopensive considering I only had two dishes and 1/2 biottle of wine it came to £120.00
5
Caught in this restaurant quite by accident. They were looking for a place where to dine Chinese food after 21-00.
A lot of local Singaporeans. Everything is very delicious. They came here for dinner again.
5
Remarkable Szechuan food. Modern presentation. Delicate yet distinctly regional flavours. Part of the Fairmont Hotel in Raffles City. Busy place, especially at weekends, even though it lives up to the reputation of Chinese restaurants for indifferent service.
3
I feel that lack of service staffs that results in difficulty in calling for them, the food serve is very slow as well. I had reminded 3 times, we have to wait till last order before getting our order that we requested when we first place order. the environment is ok. Place is easy to locate. So far still can be improve on the food serve to customers.
2
I had wanted to have hairy crab as this is the season now. The hairy crab menu was tasty but not good value for money. The worst part was the inefficient kitchen that made me as well as other tables wait really long in-between courses. It really spoilt the whole dinner experience
4
I dined at Szechuan Court while staying at the Fairmont. The decor is bright, attractive and inviting. They layout lends itself to groups and there were several clearly having good time. The food choice is wide ranging and comprehensive. Bound to find something that appeals. Dishes are clearly marked with degrees of heat.I found the food tasty and well portioned, so happy to go back again.
2
To start, and we were in when the restaurant had just opened for dinner, they only had half a roasted chicken left and no Peking ducks. We took the half, half a roast duck, and roasted pork. Nothing was crispy. Prawns were drained of flavor, fish was tasteless, vegetables were bland, braised pork was overly salted. Their "signature" hot and sour soup was beyond lackluster. There was so little crab and the flavors were so pedestrian it tasted like it came from a bag. The only tasty dish was the seafood beancurd. Quite possibly the worst Chinese restaurant in a five star hotel in Singapore
1
After being recommended to dine at this restaurant I should have known better by the reviews from other Trip Adviser bloggers. From the initial greeting to the outright rudeness from at least four of the staff we got up and left. DONT BOTHER
3
Good ambiance, service and food weren't too bad. The cod fish taste fresh and sweet! However the wasabi prawns were a little lacking in taste.
5
Great service from the staff. Was celebrating a birthday and they got it prepared. All was good too!
5
Been almost a year since my last visit. The ambience has improved; service and attentiveness of staff still one of the best. Food quality and quantity couldn't be more perfect. Had the Peking duck, stir fried long beans, szechuan soup, eefu noodles with duck and Claypot seafood toufu. Simply sumptuous. Looking forward to coming back for dim sum another day.
5
I wasn't to hungry but wanted to have a lunch And I was walking amongst all the diffÃ©rents aisle of the buildings find past the Asian markets restaurant this little gem on the next level up and was totally delighted, unfortunately for steam food dim sing was finished but had the most delicious duck and a noodle soup to go with it I really was empress with the high service and food experience The price was also very good under SGD50.00A beer jasmin the duck and noodles Great in all
5
We went to Szechuan Court for a birthday celebration and the food was delicious as usual! That was my third visit and the food and service never failed! Especially love the ambience and caring service. The fish was so well cooked and the soup was delicious too! We will certainly be back for more
3
Came here for a dinner, and we ordered a dinner set menu. The starters consisted of cucumbers, fried silver fish, and roasted pork. The food presentation was lacking, they were not individually served. The roast pork even had a bad taste of the pork meat. The double boiled soup with scallops and mushrooms was slightly better. Soup was tasty. There was also a steamed slice of pomfret. For pomfret, it is very easy to tell if the fish isn't fresh. It contains a bad fishy taste. The restaurant had probably used a frozen piece of pomfret, it tasted stale and gave the fishy taste. Other than the food which was not worth mentioning, the ambience was good, Ned the serving staff were attentive.
3
This is one of those beautiful establishments where the service far exceeds the quality of food. We came early before the 6:30pm opening and waited outside their massive chinese palace doors. We were politely ushered into our table and offered tea - which throughout our meal was regularly poured into the cup ensuring my drinking vessel is full. We ordered the hot and sour soup, spinach with 3 kinds of egg, eggplant with minced pork and spicy mapo tofu. If it weren't for the sleek interior and excellent service, I may just as well be in another chinese restaurant somewhere in a hidden corner of the city. Szechuan Court is located at the 3rd level of Fairmont, attached to Raffles City.
3
Whilst we enjoyed our meal, I have to agree with other reviews and state that the food quality does not meet the price point. We had 2 dishes and rice and 1 glass of wine each (2 people dining) - the bill was A$180. Waiters were good, quick service and quite nice atmosphere - just very expensive. Seemed popular with locals
2
Had a family gathering at this restaurant. First impression, the restaurant was only opened at 6.28pm as dinner only served from 6.30pm. Second impression, with few customers and sufficient service staff, there were 3 missing spoon soup on our table setting of 10. Lastly, the restaurant was not crowded, when we left closed to 8pm, as only a couple of big tables were occupied.We had the set menu A for dinner. For the starter dish, the roast pork was chewy and had strong piggy smell. So it was quite a disappointment. The prawn stir fried with broccoli was frozen prawns, as it looks transuclent and had a smell. Sad! Fish was served in a soup like style with salted veg, hence, it spoiled the taste of the fish. The fish also had a bit of smell, hence, I am also doubtful if it was really fresh. Overall, it was a bad dinner that left us a bad after taste. Definitely not visiting again
5
Yum yum yum! Best Chinese BBQ. We also ordered a bean curd and vegetable clay pot dish which was superb. Great service. Nice wines. Delicious dessert. 30% discount for staying at nearby hotel. Would eat here again.
5
Was recommended by my banker, really enjoyed it. Great selection of food at a reasonable price. Great outdoor setting. Best place to experience the local culture
4
Excellent service, good food and a nice ambience. Do visit if you are staying at the Fairmont, or shopping at Raffles Mall. It is worth the effort.
4
We had a rather good time dining at SzeChuan. Food was good & the ambience was fantastic. Would definitely be back again.
3
Good Ambience. Poor Standard in food quality, taste & presentation. Dessert was burnt . Noodle was tasteless. Some dishes too salty. Tim sum overcooked & dry. Perhaps its the kitchen's preference in taste?
3
We sat at the more casual and quiet Szechuan Kitchen which is connected to the restaurant and has its own menu as well as that of the restaurant. We ordered soya sauce chicken and poached spinach from the restaurant, which was average. We preferred the wanton soup, dim sum (available even at dinner) and desserts. Service was pretty good.

I've been to Szechuan Court many times, only because I have a far card membership which entitles me 50% discount. The ala carte food was ok, nothing great, you could get better food at other Chinese restaurants in other hotels. The ala carte buffet menu was decent but the food was not fresh, especially the frogs legs
4
if you want a quick dumpling and roast duck lunch, this is the place for you, service is fast and friendly and nothing is too much trouble.We always go there when in Singapore staying at the Fairmont it is very easy to get to, just get out at the 3rd floor and turn left and you are there
3
Food was good. I ordered the set menu offered by the restaurant before my guests arrived. Yet, it still took 15-20 mins After I requested for food to be served, before the food appeared. My guest had to leave before the end of the meal as she onY had an hour for lunch.It was a shame, coz she missed good dishes

Restaurant located on Level 3, Fairmont Hotel, linked with Raffles City Shopping Mall. Accessible from City Hall MRT.Cosy quiet ambience. Helpful informative waitresses. Tasty food. Appetiser was good. Love the clear soup & steamed cod.Enjoyed.Make payment with selected AMEX card will be entitled to discount (Please check with waitresses). Average about $120 per person.

The design of this restaurant is very beautiful. The lighting and furniture are very luxurious and elegant. The food is delicious.
4
Peking duck, Szechuan braised beef and Mango dessert with pomelo are just hard to beat! Great service too!
4
Great food and excellent service. Was my parent birthday and they provided with the shou tao. very thoughtful.
3
The food here is below average. I cannot find a dish where I am impressed. Service is at best average. Can skip as there is nothing worth coming here.

This place is a disappointment. Food is so so but it was so expensive!! I entertained 6 others to a business dinner. With a couple of beers a table for 7 totaled up to more than $1200 for a simple meal. Fish was served by the portion and 7 portions were a few hundred bucks!!! Fried vegetable, fried squids, a plate of towfoo and couple others chalked up the bill of over $1,200 before tax and GST!! I had probs justifying for expense claim to my company since it came closed to $200 per head after tax/gst. It was not spectacular meal and in fact the dishes were common and and exotic! Worst value for money restaurant that I have come across for a Chinese meal. Taking the same amount of money, I would have done better in a fine dining service western food!
5
We were there for dinner on 1st April and as always, we had a great time. From the delectable spread to the attentive staff and to the ambience. Our favorite dish was the beef tenderloin with black pepper sauce- the beef was succulent and paired nicely with the sauce. The deserts were also worth every calorie!
4
We went for dinner at the Szechuan court last night. We were a group of 5 adults, with a toddler and an infant. Overall service was excellent, our tea cups were never left empty and the waiters are good. Food was great... The blackpepper tenderloin beef we ordered was very tender and delicious.. I don't quite remember the names of the food we ordered but overall they have good quality of food.. The shrimp were fresh... Tofu dish were cooked just right. We enjoyed them all. Will be coming back when we visit singapore in the future
3
I have not visited this restaurant despite hearing good things about it. So it thought might as well visit to give my family a nice meal.The quality of food is largely good. Vegetables were done nicely, and the meat dishes taste good. The ambience of the place is also nice - very Chinese, attentive waiters who will notice what you need.My issue is that the dishes are not cheap. A small plate of vegetables is minimally over $25 before taxes. Meat combination dishes start from $28 for a small serving. I wonder whether we pay more for the fixed operating costs or for the food materials.My family commented that they would rather patronize Kopitiam where food servings are generous, and prices are better. I am inclined to think that way too
2
Actually I have dined at this restaurant a few times in the past and it has been satisfactory if a little expensive for what you get.This time we were not dining there by choice but because many other restaurants were closed for the Chinese New Year Holiday.Firstly they didn't have their usual menu (which is quite interesting) but a special Chinese New Year menu. Not what we would have preferred but not much choice.We duly ordered only to be advised about 5 minutes later that the main chicken dish we ordered was "finished" (this at 8pm). So instead we ordered a main fish dish. Again a few minutes later we were advised that fish was sold by the 100gms and the smallest one they had would cost S$98. By this time the other 3 dishes we had ordered had already arrived and we had to start eating them. I asked to speak to the manager. When he eventually arrived the problem was apparent, he was about 15 years old and would have had trouble managing a sandpit. He could offer no options for us and quickly sidled away. We were left with a not inconsiderable bill for half a dinner. Needless to say we will not visit again and would recommend others likewise
5
A good mix of Sichuanese and Cantonese dishes. The tuna yu sheng was delightful. Not to be missed is their beef hotpot, so tender but fiery! The signature roast meats were very good, even without the dips. The drunken chicken was good with the green ginger dressing and wine
4
Wholesomely delicious dim sum! Never fails to satisfy my tummy! My favourites were the cha-siew bao and har-gow. The fillings were succulent and generous!
4
We didn't want to leave the hotel since we only stayed for a night. Luckily we found this great Chinese place just downstairs. It's not cheap but the food is amazing.
5
Really good and different Szechuan food with a nouveau kind of twist. Dim Sum excellent as was the poached fish in broth and the wasabi prawns.
5
Had a lovely dinner on my own, with views of the fireworks, the food was beautiful, the service was exceptional. As I was dining on my own, I was provided some reading material too, which was lovely.

We are a family of 5 audits and 2 children and have a Chinese New Year dinner at the restaurant last night. We ordered the 4-person Chinese New Year set dinner and add an additional portion for the 5th person. There is more than sufficient food for all of us. On hindsight we should have ordered the 4-person set without adding additional portion.The ambient and decor is not superb, it is just ordinary. The air-conditioning is not cool enough especially towards the later part of the dinner. The steamed cod fish and the fish maw soap are very good. The rest of the dishes are just ordinary and is not worth the price we paid. Total dinner plus taxes set us back just below SGD700.Maybe we didn't order the right dishes. Then again if the restaurant cannot serve set Chinese New Year dinner on their recommended menu very well, it does not say a lot about this restaurant too!Will I visit the restaurant again? Probably not. There are many other restaurants to try out at that price tag
3
We came here for Chinese New Year Dinner. Opted for the a la carte offerings as the set menus were a little too involved, pricey and included odd-ball things we had no interest in. We were grateful to get a seat, but the cuisine was absolutely nothing to write home about. The Beijing duck was entirely wrong - it was all duck skin in weird, greasy pancakes accompanied by cucumber sticks and odd little frilly but chunky cuts of scallion. We've had much better executed Beijing duck in Chicago...The scallops with asparagus were alright, but the noodles were soggy and the roasted pork was under par - the fat wasn't rendered enough making the whole dish chewy and tough. The drunken chicken was fine as was the baby cabbage stir-fried with garlic. Bar offerings were scant, even though it was New Year's - a few beers and some wine to choose from. I can't see us making a return visit. It's clear they have a captive audience with the Fairmont and Swissotel nearby (that's why we were there). And that's really the only reason they are still in business.
5
This is my 4th visit to the Szechuan Court and as always, I am impressed by their quality of food. Their winter melon soup was good, Dim Sum is outstanding and Dessert is excellent. Service, needless to say, is up to my standard for a restaurant in a 5 star hotel. Will return to dine there
4
Brought my family for New Year's dinner at Szechuan Court. The reservation was fuss-free. The seating arrangements and ambience in the restaurant is really comfortable and quite classy. We enjoyed the Peking duck, Szechuan hot and sour soup, Chengdu chicken and asparagus in XO sauce. All the dishes were tasty with the right amount of Szechuan spices. We were spoiled with attention by the helpful staff. We even lingered around and enjoyed their hearty desserts. We paid premium pricing but enjoyed a premium night out. We look forward to returning soon

This restaurant is an evergreen fine Cantonese and Szechuan restaurant in our city. Food is consistently good, with few quibbles about the quality of their food. The environment for a Chinese restaurant is refined and classy with tables setting comfortable for conversations with those on the table (i.e., not as noisy as most Chinese restaurants in the city). Their dim sum menu do change from time to time but their interpretations of most typical dim sum items are spot on in their umami-ness. Any of their duck specialities are also good
5
Visited my first night after a long six weeks in the rain of Koh Samui; wanted a bit of luxury and some amazing food. The hotel recommend a couple of ideas and I jumped at the chance to have some good Szechuan food. Loved the table - a small booth style with semi curtain, at the window with amazing view of Singapore, I knew I wasn't in Kansas anymore. I gave a brief idea of what I like, my limits on chilli ie heat and the waiter ordered for me. I had a Szechuan barbecue pork starter, huge and it was fab-u-lous followed by a really spicy shrimp dish which I struggled to eat but got through it without blowing the tastebuds out of my mouth! I really enjoyed it and the best part of all just a quick walk to take the lift to my room
3
Booking with Chope was a breeze! We had a lovely table, great for conversations. Food was ok, but it took sometime for us to catch the attention of the service staff when we wanted to settle the bill.
4
Food was generally alright but a bit expensive. Services were good. Not that many choices in Sze Chuan food but more on the Cantonese food. I would recommend my friends to try.
2
It started with no one manning the entrance. Meals that came after more than 30 minutes and still had to wait for the rice 15 minutes later. Good food, but yet extremely overpriced for the service provided.
4
I ate in this restaurant with one of my colleagues. Despite being inside a shopping centre it was nicely decorated and had an authentic feel to it. Most of the customers were of Chinese ethnicity, large parties sitting around round tables with lazy susans (turnatables). We ordered a set menu for two and the food kept coming. It was all interesting, not too spicy and not too focused on texture. We thoroughly enjoyed the meal. The service was efficient, unobtrusive and polite. Our bill including a bottle of wine was around Â£65 GBP.
3
I was willing to try the restaurant again after my last visit a few years ago. The set lunch was pricey @ S$78 per person but the menu looked promising.Portions for the trio appetizer, braised king prawn and australian sliced pork were small.The double boiled cordyceps & fish maw soup and dessert of lemon grass jelly with peaches were average in taste.The fried noodles with shredded chicken and bean sprouts was generous in amount but dry and unappetizing - could only eat a little. The steamed cod fish was the best dish on the menu.Overall an ordinary but exorbitantly priced meal. A let down for a restaurant in The Fairmont.Hope the chefs will improve their skills and the restaurant prices their meals more fairly
3
My wife and I had been here 12 years ago and it was magnificent so we decided to try it again. First of all, the service was exceptional. The staff looked after us very well, topping up our tea and drinks perfectly. The food is very nice indeed, but be warned their spicy warnings need to be heeded. I tried a "2 flame " dish and was it hot. I don't mind hot food, but this pushed my limits. My wife had to re- order her two meals as she couldn't handle the heat, which they gladly did. I don't believe they had the variety of choices we had last time, and admittedly it is very expensive for what you get. Two entrees and two mains, a couple of beers and a rice dish and it was slightly over $200 Singapore. A Tiger beer was $14 Singapore. Lovely food, but the prices may keep me away next time
4
I'm a big fan of roasted duck. My favorite duck dish at the Szechuan Court is their camphor wood smoked duck. It comes out pre-sliced off the bone served with these amazing little cloud shaped paos and hoisin sauce. They also have a great set meal menu for the seventh day of Chinese New Year which starts with another favorite dish of mine that's called Yu Sheng (fresh and preserved veggies, sliced raw fish, and a slew of other exotic spices and seasonings that is tossed in the air to capture good fortune for the coming year)! More on this later...;)
4
Service has been great. Went once during the hairy crab season. They serve pretty good hairy crabs dishes. Most of the dim sum items are forgettable but some dishes are great. Full flavoured szechuan dishes. The place is very pretty. Love the decor and the view if you get one of the booth seats
5
A delightful restaurant that has 2 sections to it. The more authentic boutiques style with a choice of a la carte or set menu, both excellet. Or the attached a la carte restaurant. We dined here twice during our stay and they have a delicious szechuan beef that is spicy enough to get your lips bee stung and plenty of options for those that don't like it too hot! 10/10 for service. Top of the tree for lunch and very reasonably priced. The tea and braised peanuts with chilli are divine. If you stay at the Fairmont they can bill to your room, rather handy! Enjoy
3
Staying at the Fairmont and wandered down to this restaurant on level 3, effectively part of the food court in the plaza downstairs Out the front were some people dining on basic tables food looked good prices up but not totally unreasonable As we approached we saw there was an inside section.Lady explained outside was more a noodle bar the main restaurant was inside and also had set price menus like outside plus al a carte We were asked if we wanted something to drink so ordered two San Pelligrino sparking mineral water.I also asked for a jasmine teaWhen we received the menu the meal prices were extremely highSo we ordered a small fried rice, a small broccoli and a chicken dish....food was ok but no different in quality than what I could get in about 70% of the Chinese Restaurants in Sydney $130 after 10% service charge and 7% gst Mineral water $12 per bottle and tea accounting for about 25% of our pre tax meal cost I hate being blatantly exploited, a rip off
3
food considered average, thus make the price not worth it. Have lunch one of the Saturday, not many people but not easy to get staff attention. They are standing around but not attentive enough.
4
Excellent food, ambience and service during our family dinner for 9. Portions were just the right size, cooking was done very well and service impeccable. Best Chinese New Year dining experience we've had this 2015 season so far. Everyone was very satisfied.

"For a restaurant as a part of the dining selection at a 5 star hotel ink he center is Singapore, it has truly underwhelmed me and proven to be a waste of space. We ordered a shrimp dish and a broccoli between 2 people, luckily I had a late lunch at 3pm so when i ordered at 7pm I stl want hungry much at all, the bill came to 100 dollars. The shrimp was treated with boric acid, a preservative chemical that is also used to treat athletes foot, to enhance its crunchiness but kills off any natural taste of the shrimp; the broccoli was over boiled before stir-trying. My friend also ordered a single portion soup and when we asked for the bill, it ended up being 100. Nevermind the price, the level of culinary expertise of the dishes that came out was right about zero. Mcdolands would have been a better choice
2
I am an avid szechuan cuisine fan.But in Szechuan Court, I'm not really sure what's going on.There were 2 classic items I ordered which i'm sure is suppose to taste nothing as such.Don't get me wrong, I'm all for fusion, contemporary cuisine and what not's, i'm not adverse to changes.BUT, if you plan to change a classic dish you must at least have the decency to mention it in your menu that it's a 'special style created by the restaurant' or have the servers advise your customers what to expect. To top it off, the 'special style' created, did not taste good at the end of the day.The two dishes were SzeChuan spicy dan dan noodles and 'kou shui qi' (not on menu).The saving grace of the day was the Beijing duck (ironic since the restaurant is suppose to specialise in Szechuan) and double-boiled soup.The only reason that i gave it 1 more star is because the ambiance is nice.I wouldn't waste my time and money here, go to a nearby coffeeshop
5
Booked this restaurant ahead of time via Fairmont's customer service number. I booked for lunch for 3 people. We arrived 10 minutes early and the restaurant was still closed. They open at 12:00.The place is lovely with nice decors. We ordered set lunch B (SGD 78++/person) and everything in the meal was excellent especially the roasted duck! Paid 33% off because we used American Express card (discounted price for 3 pax).Totally recommending this restaurant for those who wants to taste an authentic Szechuan cuisine
4
We came here for a dim sum lunch last week and selected a variety of standard dishes. I was a little disappointed that they didn't have any scallop dumplings, but there are sufficient other choices. Prices are higher than normal for dim sum in Singapore restaurants, but I didn't find that the quality was particularly fantastic. Probably a better choice as a venue for a business lunch
1
Casual night out and instead of going to our usual hunt decided to try Szechuan court! Mistake! Ordered noodles & dumplings! The noodles were good but the dumplings were microwaved! Sorry, but I don't expect microwaved dumplings at a restaurant otherwise, could have stayed at home & microwaved it myself! Gave feedback to the management. Hopefully, they have looked into it
5
i have been to China and Hong Kong many times and enjoyed being entertained in good restaurants, but can't remember a better meal than this one. The barbecued duck and pork were very tasty and the tiger prawns in wasabi sauce excellent. The portions were generous.Service was attentive and good. The sign of a good restaurant is usually if it is well patronised by locals. Szechuan Court was full of Singaporean Chinese, my wife and I and another couple being the only Westerners. The locals were celebrating something at various tables, but I'm not sure what. However, it involved jumping to the feet and very noisy toasts, which made for a party atmosphere. The decor is attractive and we are looking forward to returning when in Singapore again next week
3
We dined at this restaurant and although the service and dÃ©cor was excellent, we were disappointed with the meal. Possibly our fault as we were expecting a Chinese Meal to suit our tastes, Australian.If you want authentic, ideal, if you want Western Style, consider it first
5
Feb 11 was the date of our Wedding Anniversary and our son based in Singapore promised us a 'Big Surprise Dinner'! That he chose Szechuan Court is a compliment both to his taste & the of the Restaurant, we came to realise! With the Chinese New Year just round the bend, we were served a truly 'royal' set meal that seemed to go on & on with dish after dish of mouthwatering stuff! We started with crunchy tasty spring rolls, followed by delicious melon soup, followed by string beans, mushrooms with tasty tofu offering! Just when we thought we had enough for one night, came the Veg Fried Rice, as tasty as can be....with numerous sauces keeping company. All the while, we had generous offering of Jasmine Tea, helping our digestive juices, I guess! Having had enough, we asked for the cheque....only to receive dessert offering of mango pudding & a Chinese delicacy (we had to request several items to be doggie bagged, as this was far far more sumptuous an offering of Vegetarian Food than we had imagined, in a Chinese Restaurant in Singapore!)If there is one area the restaurant can improve upon, it's on the Service front, where the first few items seemed to take ages to arrive, though thereafter the endless sequence of tasties seemed to flow in better
5
Good chinese meal! Is attached to the Mall so the footfall was more.
Service needs to be more attentive. Generally in a mall its hard to find good dining option but i would only go back for the food!!!!
4
The Szechuan court restaurant is that rare Chinese restaurant, which is conducive for eating on your own. The ambience is tastefully elegant. The ee fu braised noodles, and chilli beef shanks I had was good. Service was pleasant and efficient. Recommended
3
What happened? A year ago the F&B prices were almost reasonable and the wine list had some affordable South American wines. Now it is all 5 star hotel rates. The food is still good, but not worth cost. Disappointing.
4
The restaurant serves Szechuan chinese cuisine with their famous beef and tiger prawns. Overall the food was not bad service was fast and prompt. Downside was they took a long time to serve the food. And prices were very expensive compared to other restaurants.
5
Food is good but comes at a premium price.
Nice and cosy environment.
Very good service.
Will return again.
5
Some of the best Chinese food outside China. Great selection ranging from the spices of Szechuan to old faithfuls like sweet and sour and roast pork. All done to enhance the flavours and textures. Not cheap but a great place for good Chinese food
4
Second visit. Serving very good Szechuan and Cantonese cuisine. Dishes are carefully prepared and were very tasty (during both my visits). Service was good and the wine selection reasonable. The restaurant has a good selection of teas (as expected). It is not inexpensive though and rices are creeping up (assume because of the hotel connection/s and location). Try booking the Szechuan/Cantonese "table booths" with curtain as they will give you more privacy and better ambiance (these are the tables next to the window)
3
We had New Year's Eve dinner here. There were crowns, top hats, bead necklaces, trumpets and party poppers at each table to add to the festivities. They also had a big 2015 ice sculpture. These were nice touches and made for good pictures.Ambiance and service were excellent as expected. The food did not seem to be Szechuan food at all. Maybe because we asked for mild spicy only and they said even mild will be too spicy for the kids (we had 2 small ones in a party of 11). I did not pay for the meal but it was expensive for what was ordered, though I guess this is to be expected as it was hotel food.All in all, I've had better Chinese food in Sg and other countries
4
I was taken to this restaurant as a treat by my Singapore office colleagues. The menu looked pricey, but the food was great. As was the ambience and service. This is a nice place for a special occasion but may be expensive for a casual meal
3
Ambient - very good - suitable for business dining and family gathering. It is a place that you would be proud to bring guests for diningFood - fresh and adequate but not over empowering flavor. Portion is goodService - good and promptPricing - on the higher sideOverall a good meal because we have 50% membership discount.Tips : tea and soups are served by pax, hence if you do not order tea and soup, you shall save some money if you are a big grou
4
Arriving in evening and fatigued from international flight, we received attentive service and a high quality, not-too-spicy, Szechuan dinner.
5
after being rejected at Mikuni we went by Szechuan Court and my wife decided, let's try although we both love Japanes food.
The staff was extremely friendly and made us feel welcomed, fast service, good food, what more can you want.
4
Use to be best Chinese food in Fairmont Hotel - but can some drop in quality. However I love this Restaurant atmosphere. Review food quality needed - overall service and food are good.
3
Food was normal and not exactly authentic Szechuan style food, we can get similar or better quality at half the price 10 mins drive away.
1
The food doesn't taste good at all, and the way of cooking for the food is not really right. The amount of food provided doesn't fit the price listed. As if 1/10 of a whole fish costed SGD20+.. with not much ingredient provided... Seriously? I'm sorry but conclusion I won't be going back to this restaurant. This is just my opinion, it'll be different for other people. Anyway, good luck

My friend and I recently visited Szechuan Kitchen for dinner. Szechuan Kitchen is the more casual dining to that of Szechuan Court. I was told by the captain that it is less expensive at Szechuan Kitchen. The seats provided are Chinese style stools.We ordered a meat combi of roast duck and soya sauce chicken, a plain noodle (with vegetables only), a chilli oil wanton and a pot of chrysanthemum.The meat turned out to be stale and dry. The portion cost $26 ++ and although it was a small portion, we did not finish it. When I complained about the quality of the meat to the captain, there was no reaction from her.I passed my Amex Card to the waitress to charge the bill to. This Amex card entitles me to dine with a 50% discount when there are two diners. On the bill shows Chrysanthemum tea cost $8 ++ for two, plain noodle $8 ++, 8 pieces of wanton $8++, one plate of pickle (nuts) cost $3 ++. After the 50% discount, it is as good as no discount. But if the food is good, I can let it pass. This place does not have the crowd and obviously the duck/chicken meat were probably days old. And because we used our Amex Card entitling us to 50%, the prices of the other (what we called open food) items have to be inflated. I compare this place to Canton Paradise who served good roast duck and prices are far more reasonable overall. In today's very competitive F&B, this standard does not work well
4
Visited Szechuan Court for dinner on a weekday night and it wasn't even 25% filled. The almost empty restaurant worried me slightly. But the server who introduced me to the gourmet tea menu was friendly and helpful and helped me eased a little. The Sze chuan sweet & sour soup was very flavorsome and not too sour or spicy. The scallops with asparagus and trio mushrooms was a bit bland and too boring for our liking. The highlight must be the clay pot chicken with mini abalones, the chicken was tender and the shellfish soft and juicy. Try the single portion Dan Dan noodles to fill up, not a bad choice too. Overall service is good, ambience typically 5star kind of cosy but food... Expensive and yet nothing much to shout about
2
Seriously not impressed! The main courses were very ordinary. The fried rice was bland. Deserts felt mass produced. Service was unimpressive. Seriously, i can cook better. And even the more budget priced zhou kitchen served better food than this... Don't waste your time unless you are really desperate to part with your cash.
5
My clients arranged a dinner here for 90 minutes after my plane landed in Singapore. Punchy. But thankfully it was well worth the rush and jet lag.We had some kind of set menu of lots of delicious little dishes that just kept coming. I struggled a bit with some of the more spicy things, but everything tasted SO GOOD!The service was discrete, the drinks replenished without being asked, and our little private alcove was suitable for business discussions without feeling like we were shut away. I dread to think how much it cost, but I'd love to come back for a more casual dim sum lunch one day
5
After our poor experience with the Seafood Paradise at Singapore Flyer last week, we have decided to visit one of our most favourite dim sum restaurants to celebrate Good Friday.Szechuan Court is a flagship restaurant of Fairmont Hotel, and their food and service are excellent!The restaurant offers some of the best dim sum in town. Their dim sum buffet has a lot of varieties - a lot more than one would expect. The ha gao was very good, but my favourite would be the jelly fish dish. We have ordered a total of 6 dishes of jelly fishes for the four of us, and we have enjoyed it very much. The fried vegetables with garlic was excellent and my husband loves the steamed egg custard cake and the pan fried radish cake.We also ordered a winter melon soup with seafood and dried scallop while my parents-in-law ordered the fish maw thick soup with sea cucumber and dried scallop. And yes, all these items are included in the dim sum buffet.My mother-in-law especially like the 猪脚姜 dish while we like the steamed squid with shrimp paste dish.For dessert, I have ordered two different dessert and I just like both of them.This is a five star restaurant and totally worth it!Tips: book in advanc

we went for a dim sum lunch , it was very well done with a great selection of dim sums brought steaming hot to our table , a great selection on the menu , great service .
5
The food is fantastic,try the string beans with fermented olives,the cod fish melts in your mouth,just delicious.
5
Superb Chinese restaurant between the Fairmont and Swissotel. In normal Singapore style you enter from a shopping arcade but the food is really first class and the service superb. Atmosphere strangely lacking but the food is great.
2
Have been on vacation in Singapore and Indonesia for three weeks. This is the worst food we have encountered. Awful taste, terrible presentation and uneven service. The music in the place is also mediocre and repetitive. Stay away.
5
well presented though quite expensive. The shrimps are large and delicious. there are set meals for 2 or 4 as well with multiple choices. A very nice Chinese restaurant with lovely decor and great service
4
This place is busy but service still good. The dim sum items comes in 3 pieces per serving but they offered to make it 4 seeing there were 4 of us (with additional cost but at least we do not need to order 2 servings!)They are also very prompt to refill tea/water without needing us to request for refills. Overall nice and good.
3
The food was fine, if a bit parsimonious. The lighting was terrible as we were both sitting in our own shadow. You think a restaurant could get that right these days!! The price was over the top. A very pretentious restaurant with little substance to back it up.
1
I never liked the food here all these years and my recent trip here for a business lunch just reinforced the experience again. The food portions are meagre, tastes alternate from being too salty for the scallop dish to being too bland for the crab meat fried rice dish. The service is poor and the pace of serving awful. Give yourself a break and head to the food court for a Chinese meal instead
1
This establishment is the biggest in the whole of Singapore. Upon being provided a glass of water after being seated - we waited 15 minutes for a drink menu to arrive... Finally after ordering drinks - there was another 15 minute delay for their arrival. Even after prompting the waiter... We were starting to realise why the patrons on the adjacent table were expressing their dismay at the staff (over an issue with the food)...The biggest surprise at this introduction came later when there was a $20 charge on the bill for the 2x 330ml bottles of water that one could easily have assumed were offered complimentary. Not so it turned out... After the red wine did arrive, we finally placed an order, the food did arrive after firstly being served at the wrong table. My main was lukewarm- as was the rice accompanying...the pork main lacked flavour, missed its balance in being a sweet/sour type if dish... Entrees were reasonable (dumplings), but again lukewarm...At no stage did staff enquire about the dishes that were served, the poor serviced continued when we waited 25 minutes after our meal for the bill... The wait was amusing - no dessert was offered although by that time we were ready to leave. Seeing the shambles in sloppy service unfold became a spectator sport...Finally, having witnessed enough I approached the counter to pay my bill directly... This also resulted in a wait... We really did come to an understanding why every other food eatery in raffles city had queues of people waiting for a seat... The think we could have avoided that just upstairs and be slotted in for a nice meal was wishful thinking.. In the end, a decent wait for some reasonably priced and tasty food court offerings would have been worth the wait!!!

The occasion was pre-Mother's Day. Mom had always wanted to dine at Szechuan Court, so I indulged her. For a Friday evening, the restaurant was relatively quiet so it was quite easy to secure a table. The decor was modern and chic, somewhat minimalist. Lanterns hung over tables, black bamboo partitions divided sections and red frosted glass columns lines along the passageway. Nice!The cod fish was fresh and was an excellent but pricey choice. The broccoli with oyster sauce and braised tofu with vegetables was tasty. Jenny made suitable recommendations for this fussy guest, i.e. me. Service was extended with care and great attention and a special mention must go to Calvin for a job well done.A dinner for three will easily set you back by two hundred dollars, but for the service, it was worth it

Delightfully made Singapore Slings and choice of the hostess recommended items were topped off with a delicious chocolate cake dessert. The rangeof items, authencity of the food, portion sizes and delightful ambience made it a memorable family experience.

This is one of the best Asian meal we ever had. Excellent especially how they cooked the shrimp and pork.

When you think of Szchuan food yo think of pepper hot. Think again when you experience Szchuan Court food. You will be pleasantly surprised.

We stopped here for a quick bite and ordered quite a few dim sum. The food when it eventually came was not bad but we were seated in a hallway with people passing in and out of the neighboring hotel. The water was outrageously priced at 10 SGD for 33cl of water. If you come here bring your own drinks or make sure that they quote all drink prices to you as you won't find them in the menu

Selected the restaurant because we had discount voucher that could be used at the restaurant so we chose ala-carte instead of the more expensive CNY set lunches. Food was good to very good (Peking Duck, fried fish). Service was good with 2 attendants serving a small cluster of tables. Dishes were delivered on time i.e. didn't have to wait too long for most dishes. The meal was pricey which was expected for that restaurant. Best to make reservation as the restaurant is popular with locals and hotel guests

I hadn't been to Szechuan Court for some time & when the opportunity came to meet with a visiting friend staying at the hotel, I suggested it for a convenient meal. It was the second day of the Chinese New Year where a lot of places were shut so kudos to the hotel management for keeping the restaurant open. As two out of our party of 3 had food allergies, we stuck to a simple menu of 3 choices of dim sum, pepper beef, bean curd sauteed with chicken & vegetables & ee fu noodles with crabmeat. The food was fine & I had no complaints. My issue was with the length of time it tood for our food to arrive, despite being one of the first diners in when they opened. After 45 minutes with not even the dim sum in sight, I summoned the waitress. She feigned surprise & said, "Oh you want the food served now?" I was beside myself but contained my disappointment as I had guests. The dim sum orders appeared quite quickly afterwards but then the rest of the food lagged behind. Other tables ordering the new year's set menus had no problems with getting their food so I can be forgotten for thinking we were the target of discrimination. I caught the eye of a junior waitress & asked her to check the food & all I got was a "huh?" & a quizzical look. Needless to say from then onwards, all we wanted was to finish & leave. For that simple menu, the bill came to SGD 200 for three which was expensive even for hotel standards. Neither my guests nor myself will be in a hurry to return. The hotel guest among the three said she would not hesitate to complain to the front desk manager upon checkout

it is a lovely place with excellent ambiance and superb service.We made a poor choice and instead of ordering a la catre decided to try hairy crab specials options A and B. The crab is very small and the crab roe has somewhat unpleasant texture. Crab meat was a dickens to get out and oh so little of it! $200 later we left hungry. Other than that, the place is lovely, although the lights are a bit bright and A/C was keeping us shivering. We did drink lots of green tea to keep warm and even had some excellent ginter tea

The Szechuan restaurant is tucked away behind the more obvious kitchen/casual dining area. It is an upmarket venue run as a separate entity. Located on the 3rd floor of raffles city, next to the Fairmont Hotel South Tower access, one of the hotel restaurants. Be warned the dishes can be HOT, so pay attention to the menu chili guide. Fabulous flavours abound, reasonable wine prices (for Singapore) and attractive decor. Prices a little on the high side, but reasonable for the dining experience

My husband and I shared three dishes. Two were excellent, delicious and beautiful. We had lost something in the translation and ordered a different dish than we had planned for the third, but for what we ordered, it was fully acceptable - we made the mistake. The service and atmosphere in the restaurant is excellent, and I would definitely recommend it

Staff was a great help in navigating complicated menu. Very interesting food that is not much like Szechuan restaurants in U.S. Good advice on wine pairings. Portions of a reasonable size so we could have several things. It was expensive but great dining experience.

I went there for lunch, the service was slow. Dim sum there was not bad, but I though they sells Sichuan food, while more cantonese style, not authentic Sichuan way.

IF you dun mind payng a little more.

Aside from Sichuan The resto has Cantonese cuisine for those of us who can't take spicy food. Coming from hk I was doubtful but it was a pleasant surprise. We spent ny's eve here and service was good except for the steamed fish which came about an hour too late. Price was reasonable we spent sgd1,000 for a table of 11 including drinks and a bottle of wine. We were also given a private section which was cozy

It is a very nice restaurant, good ambience, great service and good food. If you are looking for Szechwan cuisine, look no further. It is authentic. We had Drunken prawns cooked in front of you. Tasted fantastic, but if you are squeamish, then this is not for you. The prawns were live and jumping! Then we had Szechwan chicken sautéed with dried chillies with an excellent dark sauce. Yummy. This dish may be too spicy hot for some. The dishes in the menu are categorized with no chilli, 1 chilli 2 chillies and 3 chillies so that would help with the choice of dishes to suit

We went last Sunday for their buffet - it's not really a buffet as you don't help yourself, but you order as many dishes as you like from an extensive menu, including dim sum, soups, noodle dishes, main courses, starters. Quality and ambience were excellent. The one criticism I had was that the soft drinks were overpriced.If you don't want the all-you-can-eat deal (which is S $36 per head), you can order a la carte. They also seem to run a cheaper cafe-style place which is adjacent to the entrance

We were recommended to this restaurant by a friend living in Singapore and must say we weren't disappointed, even if the entrance is actually in the mall between the Fairmont and the excellent Swissôtel. The interior is nothing spectacular but was comfortable.I am a connoisseur of Chinese food and can honestly say this was excellent, all the dishes we had were good, although the chicken chili dish I had was extremely hot! I had been warned by the very helpful staff, but hey I'm a macho Brit! One of my friends had an excellent pork belly dish too.Wine list was good, if a little expensive and as I live in Dubai, I know expensive!All in all a good restaurant, just a little short on atmosphere, but was full of local Chinese so they should know

you get service only if they have low traffic. it took 20 minutes to get water on the table and after a lot of persuation got some soup in 35 minutes and no food till an hour. finally had to leave after 1 hr 15 mins and find food elsewhere. How compacency and arrogance of some staff can get good institutions to behave so badly
