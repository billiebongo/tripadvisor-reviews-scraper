We visit MOS burger quite regularly. We like their original Hokkaido croquette burger, french fries and corn soup. Must have with their super creamy mayonniase.

MOS burger is really good, actually! Much prefer it to the main international chains. The classic beef/cheese burger is excellent. The restaurant is not Halal, so I think this might be keeping a few people away. But the service is good and it's def a quick meal. Prices are consistent with all other fast food joints.
