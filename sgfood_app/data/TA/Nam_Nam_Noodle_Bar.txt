We were there during dinner time. The place was filling up quickly. We ordered their soup based pho bee noodles. We also decided to explore their drinks and the crispy imperial rolls which we thought it was unique and good.
5
This place ignited my love for Viet pho and fried spring roll! The service is speedy and no frills. Fuss free experience and always love to go back again.
4
Lunch set costs $10.90 that includes either beef or chicken pho and a side spring roll dish and a drink (coffee or lotus tea). Set lunch is very filling and satisfying!
Queue is long from 12.30pm onwards. Be prepared to wait.

its an ok Vietnamese noodle bar in Singapore, banh mi sandwich, pho are standard, the ice coffee is good, tad expensive compared to eating at the hawker stalls.
5
Misses Vietnamese food so much that I was recommended to this restaurant. Walked past this a couple of times but just realised its actually highly recommended. Unfortunately the Banh Mi was sold out on one occasion of my visit. The pho is quiet nice but if the herbs are available for extras it would have been better. Overall, great quick meal

We went here for a first night in SG meal to save us hours of browsing hawker stalls, which we love, but not when you're shaking off jet lag. Nam Nam is a proper restaurant with good service and restaurant prices, sitting in the middle of the Wheelock shopping mall, on B2. When we went, mid-evening, it was busy and had a good buzz without being too raucous. As is always the case in SG, the cooking is done in front of diners, and the place is immaculate. I had pho with Australian beef, which was melt-in-the-mouth, and my wife had a king prawns pho, but she felt some of the prawns has swum away. I would eat here again, but we'll probably be seeking out hawker stalls
3
Taste is good, portion size is not so generous. Price is ok, used to be cheap (something like $6-7 per bowl, now it's $10 per bowl). The only thing that annoys us is that we need to pay $2.5 extra for beansprout + basil + mint leaves. Wherever we go to have pho (vietnamese noodle), these things are readily provided!! Any comment on this nam nam

Not bad if youâ€™re looking for a quick Vietnamese fix. Prices are affordable and food quality is higher than average. Service can be improved though. Forgetting to serve a salad can be frustrating. We had a combination of fresh rolls - one southern prawn/pork/fresh herbs and another southern vegetarian in brown rice paper. Both were served with peanut sauce. We also had a chicken noodle soup paired with green papaya salad with tofu and assorted crackers. This was a good combination. Light but filling. Satisfying meal.
5
This is one of my favourite places to eat in Singapore, the music makes me happy, very 70s playlist, appropriate for the decor etc.My favourite dish is the tangy mango salad with prawns, pork, fresh herbs, peanuts.It has such great flavours, and to finish off, Vietnamese coffee
5
When in Singapore we always come and enjoy pho at the NamNam Noodle Bar. We have tried all the different pho meals here and they are all yummy. My favourite one is the chicken pho. There is a rewards card which is a bonus because you receive a free pho after puchasing 6 bowls of pho. The service is very good with meals being brought to the table prompl
5
I love this place. Close to the real deal. Reasonably priced. Kid friendly. You have to order by ticking of a menu form though.
3
It offers most Vietnamese classic dishes but the flavors are lacking. Fast food service and price level. Ok for a quick eat but I would not recommend this chain for any authentic Vietnamese food lover.
4
Located right in basement & beside the escalator of Wheelock Place, compact place. Food & service are quick. Food pho & banh mie bread the wagyu beef inside are good. Vietnamese ice coffee is tasty with old fashioned glass. Highly recommended. It's OK-4
5
I have 4 kids and this is a weekly ritual. Staff are pleasant and fast. Meals are healthy and tasty. Our favourite is the Pho chicken, large bowls and they have a buy 6 get one free, so that works well for us. Great variety, The Banh Mee's are tasty also
4
An Ideal venue for fast Vietnamese Noodles with prompt quality service amidst packed eastern end of Singapore busy Orchard Road just outside Istana, perfectly located just above the Dhoby Ghaut MRT Station.The faintly spicy noodles soup is never too boiling hot without M&G and pleasantly laced with a patch of lime flavour, though the pot of Viet tea tastes a little vague and funny. Customer service is courteous and customer queues management is efficient to promise almost prompt seating in almost full house condition during lunch peak hours
3
The Pho was average doesn't include sprouts !! Wow!! Should have paid extra for the option but assumed it came with it like every other pho joint. But nevertheless the wagyu beef was delicious, the broth should have been slightly hotterBetter Pho in the states , especially Californi
4
Being a huge pho fanatic I was really excited to try this place. It's not bad; however, the quality of beef they use is amazingly tender and juicy and not chewy at all. Definitely something I can't get back home. Worth a try if you're having an itch for pho.
4
Had lunch here today with my local friend - we enjoyed fresh spring rolls, crispy spring rolls and pomelo salad as starters plus my friend had the Pho Chicken minus liver and gizzards and I had Spicy braised pork and pork ball noodles.We bought the mains as a set which came with a soup and cool drink.Not bad for well priced and tasty food - recommended
3
I was actually in the neighbourhood looking for a vegetarian restaurant that should have been there. But the location of that place was a renovation site. So while looking in the area I found this place which at least had some vegetarian options. I had the vegetarian spring rolls and a bam hi (some kind of variant on a hot dog) and I enjoyed both. The girls taking orders and serving food were very hard to understand. Also my bottle of water was very small.All by all a nice place to grab a quick bite when shopping in this area
4
I wandered here to find something for breakfast. I wasn't disappointed. I have never understood how or why people eat cereal or fruit for breakfast. It's cold, sweet food that my tummy just isn't ready for. But after traveling to Asia, it finally hit me - these are my people! Seriously, when everyone around you sits down at 9:30am to eat pho, you'll get what I mean. I ate the rare beef and meatball pho, and the broth was super flavorful. They provide jars of fresh "lemons" (they look like miniature limes) on the tables. There are tons of seeds, so be sure to squeeze the lemons into your soup spoon to catch them. The amount of food was pretty decent. My breakfast deal included a drink (I chose a bottle of water) and was super affordable (about $6 USD). I wish I lived here. I would be all over these food courts all the time
3
The food was good for the most part but service was slow. kept on giving items one by one. Also had to really keep on asking for one particular item whch was fried banana with sesame seeds. This was in the Plaza Singapura complex.
3
Was looking for some good Pho stumbled on this restaurant -- the service was good and fast pleasant -- but the food was not so great -- a little bit more character in the meals would help -- typical fast food.
4
Food was excellent! However I do feel it is overpriced. Service is also not the best. The bustling atmosphere however is great. I would recommend.
5
Affordable and good food. Bahn mi is good and a large variety. Good food at good prices. Nice staff. Quick service
3
Had ouch today with my friends at this place. Ordered the value lunch set which includes beef pho, 2 beef and prawn roll and lotus tea for only $10.90, no service charge. The queue moves very fast and the food arrives quickly. I felt very good as the portion is just nice and the price is affordable. Will definitely come back again with more friends
4
This outlet is at wheelock's basement/near Ion as well. Great stop to get some yummy food in between all the shopping! This has got to be my go to place when it comes to affordable decent viet food!!! The ambiance is cozy and the menu selection is also good, they serve things from finger foods to desserts and pho's. I am personally more inclined towards their banh mi's, especially the vegetarian one (being sucha bread and veggie lover I can't resist)! Their banh mi's are of a great portion and are filled with ingredients, their vegetables used are so fresh tasting and a ultimate bonus has got to be the use NO MSG for any of the food they serve. Where to get that outside nowadays right? ;-

If you do some googling, the official concept of Nam Nam Noodle Bar in Singapore to offer Vietnamese street food has been supposedly tailored for the local palate by a Vietnamese-born chef who spent most of his growing-up years in Denmark. The end result is dependent on your preferences. If you've had authentic non-vegetarian Vietnamese food outside Singapore eg in Vietnam or Australia or elsewhere and want that, this diluted concept will probably disappoint you. That said, there are some positives to a non-traditional approach for the limited vegetarian options on the menu.The soup for the phở chay is decent, being sweetened by the mushrooms and vegetables used. Onions are present so if you are allergic or have religious reasons, this dish is not an option. This visit, there were more ingredients in the bowl than on a different visit but as usual, a side option was needed to be pleasantly full (yet still with sufficient stomach space for fruits at home). The special promotion of crispy vegetarian spring rolls with fish sauce on the side for $4 is above-average and delicious, and the fish sauce is not necessary. Presentation is simple and effective. Lychee and pandan-flavoured iced tea with spring rolls and vegetarian pho came to a total of $18++ and considering the quality for these dishes, is alright.They ran out of sugarcane juice with kaffir leaves in this visit, so I ordered the lychee and pandan-flavoured iced tea, and it is refreshing without being overly-sweet. It was lovely. Unfortunately, I could not say the same thing for the service. When I raised my hand and tried to make eye contact because I wanted to ask what was in the Imperial rolls, one server obviously ignored me and walked past me. I managed to ask another server but she didn't know, so she had to ask the first server who had ignored me. They had to converse in a language which was none of the 4 official languages of Singapore, before I was told in haltingly-limited mandarin that the Imperial rolls had pork, but they could not describe it any further. The staff need better training and language lessons. The people behind the payment counter and sandwich preparation counter were aware and informative and a huge contrast to the serving staff. On a plus point, these serving staff were efficient but not pushy about removing empty dishes and clearing tables. The place was only half full, but another server could not find the person who ordered a certain bowl of phở, so he had to go back to the counter and check, but not before asking a few people at different tables if they had ordered it. He obviously had not checked and remembered the table number which had placed the order. The family which had placed the order was obviously not amused or happy, especially when one of them had received their order but the other adult was still waiting. On a previous visit, tried the phở beef combination. The soup was quite dilute and almost flavourless, the thinly-sliced beef was cooked more than medium-rare to appear just cooked and the beef was tough (which leads to questions of too-inferior beef quality and/or cooking issues). The beef balls were as forgettable as the rest of the contents of the bowl. The amount of condiments (depending on the ingredients) was miserly to non-existent, and you have to pay extra for condiments. This phở dish was obviously not authentic and terribly mediocre. Fresh bánh phở is not used for the phở, be it vegetarian or non-vegetarian. Considering it's supposed to be cheap Vietnamese food in such a prime location of staggering rents, $9 for the vegetarian phở version is understandable if you're in the heart of Orchard Road ie around Tangs/Wheelock/Ion Orchard and want quick eats of vegetarian food with no MSG and no preservatives in air-conditioned comfort. It is nice not to suffer from the after-effects of MSG, which can be more unpleasantly felt by some people.The beef combination phở is not worth $11. As to the rest of the items, I have no comments, being uninspired to try after further observation of the dishes around me on 4 different visits. For vegetarian choices, this place is comforting to know, but won't inspire me to rush back, and definitely not to queue
4
Went here for lunch and tried their special lunch offer. Good food. We had to queue up for a while, but this place knows how to handle the crowd. You just have to order and pay at the cashier and the food will be brought to you. Food is served very fast. Do get a seat near the escalator, as the back of the restaurant tends to get very warm
4
Nam Nam at Suntec is currently our go-to when we want to eat Vietnamese. We eat there at least twice a month. My husband usually orders the beef steak rice noodle soup and I the lemongrass pork noodle salad. Recently a very good value noodle soup set was included in the menu. I have the pork noodle soup, pomelo salad and vanilla pudding combo and loved it.
3
I've asked the the staff for fresh chilli for the Pho Wagyu ($19 ). One staff member told me just tell it to the cashier. Ive asked the cashier politely to add some extra chili on the side for my order. Then she told they dont have fresh chilli. - "On the picture of the menu have chilli, but they dont have" - she replied. I've repeated her excuse to the staff i was talking at the first time, he got confused first then he served a big portion of fresh chilli for me.Conclusion is that part of the staff is either lying or lazy or both.By the way, the food was good but way too overpriced
4
Worth the visit .great variety of pho n spring roll . Quite a big crowd during lunch n dinner times .minus point is you got to pay 1st before your meal .self service restaurant where spoons fork you got to take urself
5
Yummy food. Absolutely affordable. Located in the Orchard, easily accessible. Definitely a place for a quick lunch! Yummy
4
Ordered the Pho chicken and bread. Both tastes good and are reasonably priced. These are authentic Vietamese food.
5
Wasn't really what i planned... but then saw this place and as i couldn't get to Vietnam this year... felt like having a try!!
Sat at the counter near the kitchen watching all the action!! Very good!!
Should have tried one of their Phò!!
5
At lunch you can get pho+speingrolls+coffee for 15 each and bank mj + coffee for 5. Decent pho fast food. Cheap , big portions and fast
4
Their food was very good. Especially their Bahn Mi, the bread is super crispy, the sauce is good and the meat is very tender.
Overall their food was good. Sure will be back for more Bahn Mi! 👍
2
I love their sandwiches! It's a must have! The rest of the food so not so nice. They are also very stingy with their potion now and Everything is chargeable for example: Chilli and Spring onions!
I have since stopped visiting this place.
3
Their menu and food quality is not exactlty great but there is always quite a crowd for some reason. I get the feeling the staff don't see the need to present their best both in service and attitude just because the place is frequently crowded? The one at Plaza Singapura especially, they always put on a straight face when ushering you to your seat. The cashier taking your order would only be staring at the cash register, no smile whatsoever. They really don't bother. I guess even if you go there everyday and still they never find your face familiar, all because they never look at any of their customers
5
NAM NAM has got to be one of the most affordable and best tasting Vietnamese noodle place in the whole of Singapore. Good portions, delicious fresh tasting noodles, good quality of meat and great value. A hearty bowl of noodles at about $10+!!! There are not many places in Singapore where you can get great value like this. They also offer set lunches but the ala carte is what I usually would go for.Must try: beef ball noodles(special order) and the lime soda. Expect long queues during lunches.
4
Basement of Wheelock place, linked to Ion mall. Very reasonable lunch deals at less than S$11. Taste was good, portion substantial, service brisk and helpful enough, ambience fresh and tasteful. I would give 4.5 stars though was told authentic Vietnamese food taste different. I enjoyed the quick comfy lunch there.
4
This is the first time seeing such variety and creativity in the meals and drinks in a Vietnamese restaurant. One should try it at least once. Good service.
4
Modern vietnamese dish. Good location. Easy seating. Enough variety of noodles. Quick food. Only wish the service would be better. (More service mind please) Ah the lemongrass drink is so refreshing.
5
Perfect for a break in a busy shopping day.
Very good food and good value. Try the cocktail tea-mint-coconut-lime: a dream
4
Why I feel it is a good place:1. LocationIt is in the basement of a central shopping mall, right next to underground subway (called MRT in Singapore) station. The mall is in the heart of Orchard Road, the most famous shopping district. So it is easy to get there. 2. FoodMy Vietnamese friends tell me street food is far better in Vietnam after trying the dishes in this place. For a local like me, I have been to several other Vietnamese eateries and I conclude Nam Nam to serve better quality. Try the Quang Style Egg Noodles, Caramelised Crispy Chicken Wings, any Pho with soup, and Chilled 3 Colour Dessert if it is your first visit. 3. PriceThe dishes are priced very reasonably. Mains are $10 to $20, sides and desserts are $5 to $8.The place does not "wow" but I like the pleasant experience. Hope you will enjoy your visit as much as I do
4
I visit this place for lunch whenever I want a quick but satisfying Banh Mee or Pho. The flavours are authentic & the food comes quickly. The only thing is the lack of space which means sometimes the waiting times can be long....especially during lunch. Overall very satisfactory
3
I ordered the set lunch meal which included a bowl of beef noodle, 2 spring rolls one with meat one without and a coffee.the beef is tender and the doneness is just right. the soup is tasty. and right amount of veggie. I added a few drops of fish oil in to lift up the taste. The had the viet coffee with condense milk. It was too smoky to my liking. kind of over-roasted the beans. may be this is vietnam style i am not sure cos i've never been to vietnam. the spring rolls are refreshing and the ground peanut is a surprise if you never tasted before.service is not attentive but it is understandable. no complaint
5
I visit here for the first time and I have a chance to enjoy the S$5.90 breakfast with Banh Mi (Viet's sandwich) and drinks by your choice! I order the vegetarian Banh Mi called Lemongrass Tofu with mineral water and it's sooooo delicious and the sandwich size is pretty big! I love it so much❤ the waiter is friendly which makes me love this noodle bar more. You can check the menu on the website. But I assure you all the taste is very goo
2
We visited Nam Nam for quick lunch (or hoped it to be quick). Here the pros and cons of this Vietnamese restaurant.The pros-Pho with chicken and noodle soup with beef were both ok, but nothing special really. I had to add some chilli sauce to get better taste on it-Menu is big enough-Prices are reasonableThe cons-I could not understand their English, two employee were just totally clueless and unable to speak with me. One of them was obviously freshman with no training I guess-We had massive communication problems how to order the food, so I ended up walking between the cashier and our table. Frustrating-Beef was fully raw when it arrived to table, as soup was hot it was eatable after 5 minutes. Same happened with the egg-Their crackers were old and dryFood almost deserves 3 stars, but service (communication) was not ok so 2 star rating fits Nam Nam perfectly. I will not come again
4
Almost walked past this outlet...I was lost after coming out of the Dhoby Gaut MRT maze.Glad I was lost...ducked in for a quick bowl of noodles with spicy soup and a glass of lemongrass Ginger tea.The main dish was plentiful, hot and tasty...interestingly the noodles were wide and flat which was different. The soup was definitely spicy and really good.Will I go back...yes...it was quick and great if you are flat out
5
Recommend as one of the better Vietnamese places which does vegetarian banh mi and vegetarian pho. We order takeaway from Nam Man probably twice a week, normally veggie banh mi.If we go to eat, I tend to get the pho which is excellent. The bamboo straws they use for drinks when eating in are recyclable and they encourage you to take them away - a nice touch!They also have a loyalty stamp card to earn free banh mi!I would recommend any outlet of Nam Nam, they are all good
3
Pho and salad was nice (I forgot the salad dish name though). We came for lunch, place was crowded and busy so we has to wait. Nice place for a quick meal
5
The restaurant was small but efficient, the food was served quickly and although we had never had Vietnamese food we were pleasantly surprised by the flavours and variety.
3
Visited with some colleagues. Very busy during the office hours. Food could be more spicy. Had Mangosalad and Chickenwings. Price ok.
5
We ate at this restaurant numerous times during our stay in Singapore. The chicken pho is the best I have ever tasted. We also tried the beef pho and the vegetarian pho which were also lovely. The tamarind soda is delicious with the peanuts and sesame seeds. The prices are excellent and there is a rewards card system which we made use of as well. We will definitely be back again
3
Don t expect pho bo beef to meet the standards pho bo is served in major cities in both Australia and USA where Vietnamese boat people have successfully resettled 40 years ago. They brought along pho as was except the beef is even better in the USA n australiaI tried the outlet at Singapore plaza and the mixed pho bo with beef, trip n 1 beef ball costs $11. In australia and USA it comes with free flow of basil leaves and bean sprouts. here you may have to pay $2 extra. Not cheap to eat pho in Singapore and given only a few slivers of beef , this is not good value for $11, better save your money and eat in Vietnam or Melbourne or Sydney if not the states where you find Vietnamese communities..pho 88 or Than Brothers comes to mind a famous chain in the States that serves good ph
3
This place is perpetually packed! I remembered the soup tasty salty the first trip here. After reading an article that stated no msg was used in nam nam, i decided to give the pho soup another chance. Ordered the pho beef and mango salad. This time, the soup base was less salty. Mango salad was similar to thai style . I came in at 915pm. The turnover was fast but tables were left uncleaned. Nam nam should consider having more bar counter seats as this place is meant to be "fast food"
3
Visited this restaurant a couple of times. Quite busy but there is good turnover. Had the beef combo dish, beef ok however the pho was kind of overcooked. The chicken wing is expensive $4.70 for three pieces and the fried prawn in cane stick is also very small portion size.
4
I have dined here many times as I began to love Vietnamese food these days. Even though the food is not as authentic as I wanted but it can serve my craving well. Nam Nam has a special lunch set menu now at 50% discount with a choice of a pho, a drink and 2 fresh spring rolls. This is really value for money as the food is tasty and the servings are good ! Do opt for the Viet coffee as it's really thick with nice smell and taste good 
5
I haven't tried anything here except the Banh Mi. Specifically the lemongrass chilli chicken banh mi. It is so delicious, so delicious it is, in and of itself review-worthy. I would like to try something else here, because the rest of the menu looks great, however to go here and not get a banh mi would be crazy
2
They say location location location at this Resturant you have to pay before you eat.... Not so nice..... And as for the coffee sorry "it's out" you should serve the traditional way not with a quick machine.....taste is not the same so please don't say it tastes the same.
4
Good noodles great soup. No doubt.
To me its a bit to crowded and commercial lacking the Vietnam simple and humble spirit...
Pomelo salad was excellent!
4
The place to go for Pho or other authentic Vietnamese food. Busy most of the time, so sometimes the wait is quite long for a table.
3
It's a trade off since the food is good, the breakfast sets are great value but the service is abysmal, borderline rude and disorganised.
I'd likely return but it shan't be because of the service.
3
We really enjoyed the food and drinks and service was friendly and quick. I was basically and get in, order, get served and get out. Good for quick food while shopping. Not ideal for relaxing but that isn't their goal. Staff were very helpful.
4
I always come here with my mom or with friends! Their broth is so warm and delicious! It's best to come here at lunch time with a set at 10.90(original 20.90) it comes with a choice of chicken/beef slices (med rare) pho, a choice of drink (iced viet coffee, tea etc) and fresh hand rolls (pork, prawn and vege). Usually a bowl of noodles itself cost $8.50-17.90 (wagyu). So it is quite worth it to have a lunch set here! The coffee is awesome (for someone that doesn't really drink coffee) and the pho is perfect for a rainy day. Definitely fills you up.
3
Second time at this chain store. Was at the raffles city branch both times. Didn't like the spicy noodles and pork roll the first time I ate there. Paid about $18 for dinner noodle set. Not impressive. Had the banhmi lemongrass chicken sandwich today with Vietnamese fried items set. The sandwich baguette was crispy and light. Surprising. I thought it would be tough. Very nice. I enjoyed the fresh veggies and filling too. $6.90, reasonable price. The fried items set with 1 spring roll, 3 diff sticks of shrimp items was ok. Abit small, meat abit tough and oily. Abit expensive for $4.90. Overall enjoyable. Would be back for sandwiches but not noodles.
2
My wife is fro Vietnam so we know the real deal and this Nam Nam does not have it. or at least on what we had. I had the Pho Ga and Pho is all about the stock and this stock is not so good. In addition the pieces of chicken tasty soapy, not sure what was up with that. My wife had the grilled pork and rice. The pork was very well done and tuff. Highly unlikely we would return
4
Went there a couple of times over two days - first time for lunch (had pho with pork balls and a fruit cocktai. The pho had a nice kick to it and the drink was very refreshing on a hot and humid day. The second time I just had a quick snack - a special with a selection of small dishes. Both times the food came out quickly, and it was hard to fault it. Price was also pretty reasonable given the location. All up, I'd recommend it. I think it would be good for families as well
3
The soup is piping hot which was great! However, I found the soup a bit too salty. I did not recall having beef soup like this in vietnam, although the cafe was served by a few staff members who are vietnamese.Perhaps nam nam is serving beef noodles fromAnother region?I am not sure of that.. The queues were long each time , did not feel that the pho was fantastic
5
Nam Nam is one of my favorite restaurants in Singapore. It serves classic Vietnamese cuisine, especially the Pho's. I love their Pho Beef Combination! The broth itself is delish! Their Bahn Mi are also yummy and big enough for two people. They also serve different rolls and salads. During weekdays, make sure to go there early since people are always line up to have their lunch there. :
5
Beautifully fragrant and tasty soup - even better than some we have tasted in Vietnam. I keep on going back to Nam Nam for their pho with beef - such a treat! Go early or late lunch. Otherwise it could be a hungry wait.
5
Lunch at Nam Nam be ready to Q during lunch time .Order the recommended Set lunch .Service was fast.Food came quickly ..Beef Noodle soup was serve Hot... Beef was tender.Must try Vietnam Beer..taste great......
4
Usually crowded so it's a place for quick meal. Quite okay pho in Sg and we like the tasty chicken and floss bun too. Viet coffee with milk is rather good too.
3
Walked past this place numerous times under Wheelock.
I would say the pho is OK for local standards. It still does not reach Vietnam levels.
But what I liked about them is the availability of sauces for the soup (which is plain).
5
We loved this place; the food was really tasty and very good value indeed. We popped in for a lunch and an early dinner; it was always full. The staff were really helpful, and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves
5
Understand that owner of this restaurant is from Vietnam so taste of pho soup has been more than authentic. Why? Pho soup there is tastier than what I tried in Vietnam, not to mention the setting and cleanliness of outlets in upmarket malls at Raffles City and Ion impress too. The set lunch at $10.90 is a steal comparing what is offered elsewhere nearby. No MSG, as claimed and it seemed to be real from experience. Order Lotus tea to go with the set to leave behind the fragrant of this tea leaf between your teeth. Highly recommended
3
Food was good, no doubt about it. Ordered dry egg noodles with minced pork, pho with beef slices, lemongrass chicken bread and fresh spring roll. I asked for more soup for my pho and was asked to top up $0.30 which was fair. They refilled my bowl with another serving or super flavorful broth. We couldn't finished the bread and asked to pack it up. Waiter came back and said we had to pay $0.50 for it!!?!? We were appalled but did so as we had not actually touched the bread and didn't want to waste it. Of cos we were expecting some atas packaging but guess what...... It was wrapped in 2 pieces of thin food wrap and a normal plastic bag! Why were we charged $0.50 then? I didn't think it was money fairly paid cos I had never paid for food takeaway at restaurants or cafes. Photos of the packaging are posted for your attention :)
5
We ordered a few sandwiches to share and our collective favourite was the Pulled Pork. Its a great but busy lunch location so the wait-times can be a little long.That said, the busy vibe and the open plan bar and kitchen made for an attraction in itself
3
My favorite pho is in United square called Banh Mi 888. At the beginning when it's just open. It was a lot of topping including sweet basil which I really like. My last visited everything was less. I decided to try Nam Nam at Plaza Singapura yesterday. The soup was quite nice compared to my favorite shop in Singapore and quite close to the one I always had in Hanoi. I love the small lime that provides on the table. It's adding more flavor for the soup. Chicken was marinated well and tender. One thing that missing was Sweet Basil. I couldn't see it at all. Definitely will be back for the soup though.
3
Nice place for a simple lunch, dinner or even breakfast. Quality of Pho is normally gauge by the beef, and most important of all the soup. In this case the beef slices (medium rare done) was very good, but the soup was rather lacking.Pros:- Service was excellent and fast- The sesame rice crackers are very good- Beef slices was goodCons:- Pho soup was rather weak in taste, needing more star anise and cardamon- A lot of what's norm in other Pho bar, is extra cost here (i.e. bean sprout)Summary:Feels kind of like Nam Nam is trying to be the budget airline version of Vietnamese noodle bar, with lot's of payable options.Good place for a quick meal
4
I love Asian food and finding good Vietnamese food in Singapore is not a disappointment! I love their rice noodles and with all the sauce... it is a worth eat dinner meal.. big enough to give me full happy tummy!
5
Simple fare. Great for a snack or light meals, we also get take away every now and then. Especially love their yummy sandwiches.
5
I really love this noodle bar! Like this is my go-to place whenever I want comfort pho food from a stressful day at work. The pho and bahn mi are oh so authentic and delicious! Not to mention, it wont burn a hole in your pocket. Food service is quick so its perfect really for after shift meals. Though the que may be sometimes long during dining hours, your turn would come very quickly because of their efficiency. So go ahead, splurge! :
4
In this chain of Vietnamese restaurants I was in the one located in the mall of Wheelock Place: you can find a very good PHO.The restaurant is very busy but if you are a couple or alone can eat at the counter looking at the people preparing Vietnamese rolls and PHO. It is interesting.Since it is a sort of noodle bar, it is recommended for lunch during the shopping in Singapore
4
This is a small but busy restaurant in Wheelock Place Singapore. Have been here many times the quality is always good. The food fresh and the service is fast.Its always busy and as it is a small place you may have to line up and wait a while, but its worth it. Make sure you set key location markers on your way to the restaurant as it is located below level in Wheelock Place which is a bit like a rabbit warren and it may be a little difficult to find it a second time if you do not

This Vietnamese chain restaurant serves up really authentic vietname pho. I missed the beef pho after having not visited Vietnam for years and was glad nam nam came to Singapore. Some of their staffs arevietnamese and the soup of beef pho was so delicious and light. Improvement may be more vegetables in the pho cos in Vietnam they serve huge plate of bean sprouts with it. it's about $13-$16 for one person plus drinks. Seating can be uncomfortable cos they try to squeeze as many people on the diner. Food came fast though. More like a fast food restauran

I love Pho so have tried many places. Nam Nam is my favourite in terms of; 1. taste; very mild soup cant taste MSG. 2.price; $8-10 range and discounted if you have Passion card and spend more than $20. also they dont charge service fee and GST is inclusive.3. clean place; well maintained and bar you can watch how phos are prepared.

I can't comment on the other nam nam noodle bars in Singapore (there are 6). This is the place I went to twice while attenidng a congress in the Suntec city Convention center. Delicious and faaaaaaaaast! I had the dry sauteed lemongrass pork noodle with a lime drink (twice). They are extremely efficient and the food is so good. Besides that it is excellent value for your money: 10.20 singapore dollars for the noodles which is a complete lunch

Located at Wheelock food Court, Nam Nam offers the famous Vietnamese menu from noodles to sandwich. The restaurant is always packed with both locals and travellers. They offer very good value fro money. The only trouble is the popularity. You usually need to wait for 5-10 minutes to get the seat. If you need something casual and quick, this is ideal place to go for early lunch or early dinner
3
Easy menu to fill out and then you walk up to the counter to order and pay for food up front. Fresh spring rolls were good but missing sweet chili sauce. Came with peanut sauce. Phoun soup was huge but tasty. Food served very quickly. Basically a vietnamese version of Macdonalds
5
Had a great meal here with colleagues, lunches at Nam Nam are always a quick and dirty affair, and the quick service helps facilitate the fast in fast out process.
2
lukewarm soup. inconsistent serving size. rude service staff. disappoints nearly everytime. in don't know why I go back. must be the msg. don't make the same mistakes I made.
4
My beef set lunch came with appetiser, beef steak pho in soup & drink was only $9.90. Excellent value! The beef steak pho was medium cooked - which is good. The soup doesn't taste very authentic but still good. Very interesting appetisers - some kind of rice rolls with dried shrimps which was quite yummy. Don't usually like coffee with condensed milk but this one turned out to be not very sweet - which is more to my liking. A good place for a quick lunch
2
I don't understand why people go nuts for this place. Maybe because they have to have something at Wheelock Place? While the soup is good, it's not exactly great nor authentic. And the beef is hard to chew. Not rock hard, but maybe they cut it wrong or whatever because we couldn't bite it off to smaller pieces. Almost choked because I just had to swallow the goddamn thing whole

When i saw so many rave reviews on this eatery, i just wonder am i too fussy or are the rest of the diners are too lenient. If you are looking for authentic vietnamese food, this is not the right place. The real deal is in Joo chiat area where there are many vietnamese and they operate authentic vietnamese food prepared by vietnamese. I went with my vietnamese friends to this place. They have been working in Singapore for the past 10 years and at times, when they feel homesick, we will find vietnamese restaurant. We tried a variety of food in this eatery. The viet coffee was super diluted, the baguette was served cold and as hard as stone, meat was little and it taste so......amateur. If you been to saigon or hanoi, the vietnamese baguette inherited a lot of french style with a unique fluffiness in the bread. Never will you ever find such in Singapore, unfortunately. The noodle taste like mee pok, at that moment, i really thought my friend ordered mee pok - a horribly tasted mee pok as well. ( mee pok is a local singapore hawker noodle, flavourful and awesome !) When we looked at the queue outside, we just wondered were we that fussy....and the answer was obvious
3
This would be the second Viet pho restaurant I visited in Singapore so far. Food was good, soup was hot and delicious. If small eaters - consider sharing. Portion might be too big. As it is self ordered and payment, should have provided better customer service to advise how best to order the food. Prices on the high side because it is in Sentosa just outside the casino. But surprised to find flies in the restaurant. For time in between breakfast and lunch there are less than 6 people.

My wife and I frequently visit Nam Nam when we are shopping at Plaza Singapura. They have great food and quick service. This is not a normal sit down restaurant. You get assigned a table, fill out a ticket and pay at the counter and then have the food delivered to your table. You grab your own utensils from a station. My wife and I shared some fried spring roles and duck noodles with two drinks and were stuffed. We often have the fried banana fritters with coconut sauce for dessert. The serving size is huge and they are hot and tasty and a great value for the price

My sister and myself were in Singapore somewhere in middle of January. The set lunch of slice beef looked really enticing on the menu,so we ordered that together with Cny meal if I'm not mistaken prosperity noodles and iced coffee. Both noodles were very tasty loaded with lots of meats and vegetables. The iced coffee drink was refreshingly good,not too sweet. The staff were friendly, very fast and attentive. I still remember one your staff, not sure whether she is One of manager there, recommended us to try prosperity meal,she was humorous and witty. That's delicious meal left me yearning for more two month later. Now, my husband along with 2 kids is here. We ordered the same noodles but sadly this time no prosperity, so we decided to change our menu to pork ball noodles. We also had fresh spring roll, fried roll and together with chicken wings. I was shocked when they bought out both noodles, not only had the portion shrunk to half a bowl, but instead of the nicely presented dish of meats and vegetables, the top of bowl was just scattered with a few of fresh onion. The condiments that came with the noodles were simply pathetic, a few strands of onion,2-3 rings of chili and thinny of lime, so thin you've have trouble to squeeze it to get some juice out. The iced coffee came out packed with ice cube,so at the end you get just about a few tablespoons of actual drink. The staff have change and while the restaurant wasn't half full, we were waiting for staff the clears our table, I guess the next step would be to go the kitchen and get you own food yourself. Sad that lots of businesses start out excellent, then they try to get rich quick and find ways to cut cost at the expense of quality and quantity of their food. Will not be going back to this one! Suntec city

Nam Nam is great for a quick meal. I eat Pho every chance I get and Nam Nam is alway consistent. The flavors are a little different than what I have experienced at most Vietnamese restaurants, but still very good. The service is always quick and feel satisfied when I leave. The iced coffee is great too
3
Ordered a beef noodle. The broth needs more time to cook, the serving of noodles and beef comes in small portion. For the price I paid for Vietnamese noodles, this is not worth it. I had a bowl of noodles and a side dish, felt like I only had a snack.
4
Excellent value for money and tasty sandwiches available for quick take away especially :) eat there at least twice a week.
5
The food here is so good, you really feel like you're eating in Vietnam. Definitely worth checking out for a quick lunch.
4
A friend introduced me Nam Nam and I couldn't wait to try when I had a short vacation in Singapore. Pho was great, tasty and quite similar to Vietnam version but Banh Mi is so so :-)
4
Best Pho in our opinion. Soup has that perfect balance of beef and herbs. Firm but soft noodles, meat so tender it's falling off the bone. The sandwiches were super nice. Highly recommended. Not satisfied with the taste & quality of the fried spring rolls. We'll avoid that next time
5
My husband and I came across this place randomly on a Sunday afternoon and it was packed at 240pm. It caught our eye because we love Pho and Vietnamese food, so we decided to go back there for dinner. The system is great. No frills, pay and get served fast. You sit next to random people, but it is definitely worth it. We had the beef ball Pho with rice noodles and the chicken Pho. Both had this excellent no msg clean taste. It was very good and we would come back and have it again. The cha gio was just Ok. The wrap was the right one, but the filling was Medicore. The service was great and the people were very nice and efficient. We recommend this place.

I've noticed the Wheelock Place location is always packed when passing through and have always been interested in trying what they offer. Needing a quick lunch and finding myself in Plaza Singapura with a small queue of 4-5 people, I decided to give it a try.What a mistake. All you could taste in the chicken pho broth was lime, over-powering the beautiful delicate flavours present in a worthy pho. I obviously didn't read the menu properly as the pho was lacking the bean sprouts and anything remotely looking like fresh herbs - these things are a part of a pho dish, not an 'extra' that you have to pay for. Would you serve Hainanese Chicken rice and get people to pay for the soup and chilli sauce?Then it dawned on me after a few mouthfuls that the chicken looked a little pink. Looking closer and the chicken wasn't cooked all the way through. Fishing my way though the pho, I find other pieces not cooked completely. I should have asked for it to be replaced, but after eating some half-cooked sliced chicken didn't like my chances of them getting it right again.It took no more than 3 minutes from placing my order until it arrived (and dumped in front of me no less). A quick lunch can be good, but not when it's at the expense of it not being cooked properly. The fresh lime soda was pretty average too
5
I had no idea what I ordered but when it arrived it was really tasty. I was helped in my choice by a very friendly chap (the manager I think) and have to say that he chose well. Half price beer really helped to wash it all down
4
Whenever we pass by this restaurant in Wheelock, there's always a queue. So one day we decided to give it a try since they were having a promotion at that time, $10 meal consisting of Pho, a side dish, and a drink. unfortunately, it was not available during weekends. a big bowl of Pho would range around $7-10. At first, it doesn't look much but the taste is superb and not oily. And expect the place to be packed during the weekends! If you will dine with a group, you might need to wait a bit longer to be seated

When Nam Nam newly opened in Singapore, they offered the set noodle with their delicious spring rolls. It was a kick and loved it so much that I went for an ongoing basis. However after a while, as their business grow, they didn't seem to offer anything better than that. Which came down to the recent mixed sour vegetable/ salad as shown on my photo (I took this shot while dined at their Dhoby Ghaut branch, posted here as there was this new branch location is not stated in Tripadvisor, but their food is the same in all branches anyway).The noodle has never been truly authentic, especially they have been much more other Vietnamese restaurants popping up throughout Singapore. I will go for those that taste much more authentic with better or equal deal. After all, I think Nam Nam is popular mainly because it's on of the affordable noodle place in the city area that offer convenient with low price food
2
My wife and I love good Vietnamese food and therefore looked forward to try this new place for a quick meal on a night out. I am glad it wasn't too expensive as the food we ordered was either inedible, the fried soft shelled grab, bland, the Quang style egg noodles or fair, the Fresh Southern rolls. We were going to get the Pho but seeing that it wasn't served with the basil leaves, sprouts, chili pepper, etc. we decided to skip it. This place is open air but open inside the mall. It seems very popular and you can end up eating with other people, which is fine if your not on a date. You have to order your own food and the soft shell crab came late after we had eaten the other food and it was really the worst I have ever had. All greasy hard batter. There are some much better Vietnamese restaurants in Singapore so take your time and find them
3
If you need to try some pho, do check out this place for a quick simple noodle with no msg. Liked the spring roll side dishes. Didn't like the jasmine tea which came in a "bamboo-ish" straw which smelled weird.
1
Heard a lot about this place. Long que. Tried the beef noodle and sandwich. Quite disappointed of the food. Below average. Would not come back again
1
I came to this place while craving for Vietnamese food. The food tasted terrible and I couldn't finish my dish. If you want to find an authentic Vietnamese restaurant, please don't come here.
4
Nam nam was a treasure find for food. Great value for money, filling yet light on the stomach. You don't feel heavy ...hope it makes sense !!Had the chicken rice noodles. The noodles are so light, soup has a lime tangy taste and the chicken is liberally given in the broth. Try it. .you can add the starter as a salad or appetiser.but we just had the chicken noodle dish and it was sufficient.
4
Sometime I went Orchard, I always try to go there to take my coffee and pork ball pho. I like to choose rice noodle for pork ball pho. Taste is excellent and coffee is good enough :)Most of time, Q is bit long but must wait for good food
3
We each had a nice Bahn Mi sandwich, made with proper crunchy baguettes, and shared two fresh spring rolls, that were just average. While I've been served better Bahn Mi sandwiches and fresh spring rolls (in Houston!), these were fine and the prices (for Singapore) were excellent. The restaurant is noisy and crowded but the service was quick and efficient, even though there appeared to be a longish queue
3
Good place for quick eat as an alternative to the numerous Singapore food courts. Soup base is tasty but the other ingredients especially beef lacks consistency. Of the many times I have eaten there, the beef has gone from tender to chewy and more often now, chewy. Even the wagyu has dropped in quality. I found the fried side dishes too oily and would only stick to the noodles every time I go
2
Such a bummer to have to rate Nam Nam subpar, however they consistently run out of their more popular items very early in the evenings. We frequent this location weekly, and recently without fail, they are always out of most things we come for. Management really needs to do a better job projecting for predicable demands on weeknights, weekends and holidays
3
I eat vietnamese food regularly, and I guess I expected more from this place. I saw the cue of people, and got taken in by that, thinking it was better than it was.Overall, food in Singapore was ordinary, and this place was no exception.Just ok when compared to better viet food offered in other citie
4
My first impression was that Nam Nam Vietnamese noodle bar was relatively popular with a sizeable lunch crowd. We had to queue for 15min before we were seated. Like most noodle bar, we ordered using an ordering chit. The lunch specials (S$9.80) was a good deal and included a sour Vietnamese salad, beef/ chicken pho and a beverage. Our foods arrived within 10min after ordering. There is not much dining ambience to talk about. The phos were decently delicious. The side dishes (we tried the chicken wings and Vietnamese spring rolls) were also well-received. In all, we had a satisfying weekday lunch at Nam Nam Noodle Bar
4
Love the pork roll with fresh lemongrass, the sweat, sour flavours. Next time I'm back I'll try the soup. But I recommend the fresh crunchy rolls.
1
Have been eating Pho for the last 30 years, I could not eat this "pho" at all, ordered 3 beef noodles. The soup was salty and tasteless, beef was over cooked and too thick. I am from Australia and Pho over there is 10 better.
5
This was my favourite breakfast experience in Singapore this time. Crusty french bread with Asian & Tofu salad . My husband had sardines...the business!
5
We grabbed a quick bite here and will come back. The Chicken Pho is clean and fresh as are the spring rolls. Very good food at a reasonable price.
3
Work lunch with colleagues.Had to wait for seats as restaurant full.Ordered the beef noodles set @ $9.90 nett which comes with a salad and a drink.Salad is refreshing but a bit too sweet.The lotus tea is tasteless.Enjoyed the beef noodles which have thinly sliced tender beef.Appreciate that there is no service charge, though service was quite good and fast
4
I am a regular customer of the Raffles City outlet (more than 10 visits each month).Although the pho does not taste the same as what I had in Vietnam, I like the noodles there especially wagyu beef or beef combination pho. I like the veg rolls, southern rolls and chicken wings, and lime soda as well. Overall the service is really efficient. And most staff recognise my face and help me to customise my pho due to I don't like spring onion and white onion also I like to have three slices of lime for my pho.However for my recent two visits (yesterday 25th Aug and today 26th Aug) the same part timer (a lady who barely speaks English but Chinese with a flower-shaped stud on her nose) attended to me and the dining experience was really disappointing. She refused to let me sit at my favorite sofa seat (understand it is designed for 4 pax but I usually visit during non peak hours like 3pm or 4pm). She also refused to serve me extra slices of lime despite I already requested with the cashier. Yesterday when I was at the cashier paying for my order she guided three other people to occupy the seat I already reserved and today after some nonsense argument with her regarding the seat assignment I simply lost my appetite and ended up eating somewhere else. And when I passed by the restaurant after dinner another male staff who knows me well talked to me and apologised to me on behalf.Dear management and recruitment team: please do not employ such dumb part timers or please train them properly about how to attend and cater to the guest instead of how to make the loyal customers stop coming back
4
Everytime i go to namnam, then i'll order their pork or beef lemongrass baguette. Although the baguette is a bit hard, i still like the lemongrass fragrance from the juicy meat. So i forgive the hard to bite baguette bread.The pho, if you are the type that like the not too tasty one, then you can try here. The soup is just alright for me. I still prefer their dry noodle rather than the pho. All noodles are acceptable. They also have an instant noodle with herbs and meats. Honestly speaking, this is very nice! Though you need to pay 8.9$ for an instant noodle.The service is good and the price are reasonable
5
Ever since we tried it in first half of 2014, we were back for at least another 5 more times! I've craving for Nam Nam's food! We usually order Chicken Pho and Lemongrass Pork Bread. Bread is crispy! The lemongrass pork filling is delicious! Get a sauce plate and fill it with Vietnamese chilli sauce, dip the pieces of chicken in the bowl of chicken pho for a spicier taste. Very tasty soup and I love the vegetables in it. Reviewing the food makes my mouth waters. We will be back very soon! (Plse note that besides Nam Nam at Wheelock Place, there is another one at Raffles City basement too.
5
this is a tiny little place under Suntec Tower 2for a fast lunch, you cant get any faster, sometimes the food arrives to your table before you can even get there after ordering, perfect if you're in a hurrypiping hot, tasty and fresh, what more can you ask for - ah, price, absolute value for moneyI had the beef Pho, and I tried the baan too, all are delicious so hard to chooseI wish they had the traditional pate one too as i'm sure it would be deliciousthe spring roll appetisers so tasty toonow this is not fine dining in any way, its how we all like to eat especially in a hurry, fast and delicious. Service isn't fine but it is fast and they are friendlyabsolutely super and I'd eat there again and again, very authentic and a place you feel comfortabl
4
If you like the affordable and nice vietnamese food in singapore shopping mall, i think you should try nam nam.I like their baguette sandwiches, especially the roasted pork with lemongrass.The sweet and fragrance of lemongrass sipps from the tender meat.Their choices of noodle/pho quite a lot. You can choose two options, with rice noodle or instant noodle.I feel the pho is not that nice if you compare with the baguette bread they have.If you are quite adventurous, you can try their dry noodle with herbs and spices. They use instant noodle, and it tastes delicious.If i were you, i would order the dry noodle plus the baguette sandwich in nam nam
5
The beef and pork noodle that we had was great, appetising, and the sweet sour salad that came with the set adds to a truly satisfying meal. The pork belly sandwich was yummy, better than most burgers tasted
3
Food was quite authentic but very expensive coz of the venue, i guess.
Quality was bad, we ordered wagyu strips and i dont know what was served, seriously. If you really want to eat pho beef/chicken, consider elsewhere....
4
Excellent baguettes & white cabbage salad. Pho & other noodle dishes were pretty good, coffee & deserts are ok as well. Their wheelock place outlet has a permanently long queue better to go to suntech more spacious and usually no waiting.
5
Great food, reasonably priced. Very quick service! A good place to dine if you just want something fairly simple but delicious!
4
Vietnamese food is hard to mess up. These people seem to have it right.A few good things,1. you queue to order and then are assigned a table, which is good for a fast meal.2. The staff are mostly Viets which is also good. they are friendly and respond to a kind word in Tieng Viet.3. Food was good.the down side1. It has been Singaporeananised to make it ok for the locals. - coffee wasn't really that good - it was more like local coffee - not the real viet deal,2. It is a bit noisy which is again for local audience.3. for those who eat off the street in Vietnam the process were high but There are better places to eat Vietnamese food in Singapore, but if you are at ION and need to eat, this place is ok.I would come again. Service is better than most places in basement 3
4
Very crowded and packed like sardines with 2 long lines, to get in and to pay at the cashiers before your order is logged in...but don't be deterred by all that! We went early on a weekday but there was still a line to get in. It took 20 min to get our order finally logged in but food came within 5 min so our whole lunch took less than an hour. The pho was tasty with al dente rice noodles and beef steak slices. There's also a choice of wagyu slices at a very reasonable under $20 price. They also have a Value Lunch set with salad, pho and beverage. The Vietnamese coffee was strong and authentic.The baguette sandwiches have unique fusion combinations

*This review is for the Suntec outlet but unfortunately, they do not have an entry.Nam Nam Noodle Bar is my go-to place for a quick fix if I have a craving for Vietnamese Beef Pho.My usual haunt was the outlet at Raffles City which always has long queues come rain or shine. However, since other outlets have opened up, namely Wheelock Place and Suntec City, I have been patronizing the outlet at Suntec City quite a fair bit (i.e. less crowds!).This time, my group of two friends and I decided to try their Lunch Set @ $9.90 (excl. GST) consisting either1. Beef Steak slices Pho + Salad + either coffee or tea OR2. Chicken Pho + Salad + either coffee or teaVerdict:- Beef Steak slices Pho - The soup had all the usual goodness of beef flavourings but it lacked the punch and oomph that I was used to. The beef slices was a tad too stiff for me; not that it was over-cooked but I've tasted better on other occasions at this outlet.- Salad - Refreshing and had a tangy sour taste reminiscent of the Peranankan 'ah char'. The small side dish consisted fish cake, pickled cabbage, carrots and a sprinkle of nuts and chili flakes.- Iced coffee with milk - I found it bland and bitter for my taste. Totally unlike the famed Vietnamese coffee that I had in Ho Chi Minh City.Tip: The place gets pretty crowded from 12.15pm onwards with the office lunch crowd. Do stop by at 12pm sharp to get pretty good seats and enjoy 15 minutes of quiet lunch before the crowd sets in. Otherwise, it might be hard to get a conversation going among your lunch group
4
Long wait for a table at most hours of the day. My 1yr old son and I were asked if we could share a table with 2 others. And the staff was very helpful in getting us all seated. Service was very good.A high chair was available for my son. Food was good but on the pricey side. With so many other noodle options nearby, not sure if I would go back.
4
We had our first morning's breakfast here right when they opened. the food is good and the people were nice. Price reasonable. Later in the day, Nam Nam always was busy, usually with a line of people waiting to get in. so, you know it's popular
3
We had the pho noodles and a banhmi. The broth for the noodles was disappointing (I expected better because the place was pretty crowded). It lacks depth and aroma; I'm not sure what ingredients are missing but I think some key things are. Also, the pho here does NOT come with the customary plate of bean sprouts, Viet basil, mint etc. The taste of the banhmi was average. The bigger problem was the texture of the baguette which was crispy but a little on the hard side, which made eating it a little uncomfortable (it scraped the roof of my mouth...ow). I think a good banhmi baguette ought to be crispy without being hard; light and easy to bite.I don't understand why there's a crowd at this restaurant..
1
Had a viet sandwich which was all bread n v little else. N the little else tasted processed. Service was slow n chaotic. Please avoid. I wasted a meal here when there r far better restaurants around
4
We ate here twice. The lunch set special was a good deal and quite tasty and fresh (drink, pho, pickled salad). Later we had pork with lemongrass, curried duck, chicken wings and shrimp on sugarcane. The duck sauce was a bit too thick and overpowering, but the rest were well executed. I'd eat here again. Compared to food court food back in Canada, this was very good quality. I know that there is a whole food court culture in Singapore, but we didn't eat elsewhere, so I can't offer a comparison
5
Loved the food - most unexpected quality and taste from a fast food eatery. Service was also good. Disliked small wooden tables and stools. This place was always crowded - which is always a good sign. Tip - only chopsticks or spoon available to eat with - so make sure you know how to use them

I love Vietnamese cuisine. Though there are Vietnamese restaurants I like more than others in the cities I've lived in (or traveled to extensively), I haven't really ever encountered a Vietnamese restaurant that I absolutely disliked... until I visited Nam Nam Noodle Bar.The Good:"Price": Pretty affordable given other food options around."The system": If you observe how Nam Nam is run, you'll quickly notice that everything is setup for maximum efficiency (+ table turnover rates). How does the restaurant increase efficiency? ...well, please see below...The Bad:"Food" (Pho / Banh Mi): Whether you order chicken pho or beef pho...doesn't matter! You'll get the same bland-tasting broth (from a giant pot on the stove). (i sat at the "Bar" area and saw how they prepared food.) If you sit at the "Bar area (i.e., cooking station), you'll see that every bowl of pho is prepped the same way-- broth scooped from the same giant pot on the stove, then the noodle, and lastly, sliced raw beef / chicken (depending on the order) + cilentro / garnishes. But because the noodle was never cooked with the broth, the noodle itself is even worse than the broth--tasteless and overcooked. In addition, to expedite the "process," vietnamese coffee is no longer drip coffee, but made from coffee machine. Which is OK if the coffee tasted nice, but it wasn't. Banh Mi was w-a-y too bready, especially given how little content (pate, cucumber, pork, carrot) there was in each banh mi."Service": Service? Pretty much non-existent
2
I've lived in Vietnam for 5 years, and this is poor-average pho. For such a busy place, I don't understand why they can't go to the trouble of making fresh noodles, rather than using dried noodles. The broth is quite nice, but everything else is just "ok". The spring rolls are poor, the vietnamese coffee poor. The fact this place requires queue-ing (at night seems the wait is c. 20 mins) is just unbelievable. We went at 10 am and there was no queue. To queue and get a food experience like this would be very disappointing!It is cheap though
5
Loved this food bar/restaurant in Raffles City food court. The food was fantastic and so cheap. It helped me get over the fact that we decided at last minute to forgo Vietnam and concentrate only on Singapore, re visit my husband's Singapore American School stomping ground!
3
Decided to stop because of the smell of the pho. Decided to give it a try, was kinda dissapointed because the taste wasn't what i expected. I tried the Pho with beef slices. It was allright, not worth the price. The broth is not rich with flavour. I did not try the sandwich though, it seems to be another popular menu
4
Set up in roadside-stall style, the wooden tables and chairs, enamel mugs and red lanterns at the bar lend the feeling of a Vietnamese experience in Singapore as authentic as the Southern prawn rolls with a nutty dip and the thinly-sliced beef steak pho. The tasty beef broth is a tad salty but is well-flavoured with cut red chilli and a slice of lime. The green garnish is mostly spring onion though more sprigs of basil could be offered, at least on the side, for a truer taste of Hanoi.Included in the weekday lunch set is a choice of lotus green tea. This lightly fragranced beverage provides a crowning sensation for the afternoon repast
4
Good bowl of pho in a cozy corner of a major shopping complex in the middle of bustling central business district area. The price per bowl is on the steep size, but I suppose, understandable given the location. I would go back again, but probably not as often as I'd like due to the cost.
3
This review is for Nam Nam outlet in Basement Raffles City. The service is quick since the ordering process is quite efficient. Customers are shown to their tables or bar counter seats. Customer select their food on the ordering form and bring the form to cashier to pay. Within minutes, food would be delivered to you.I tried the Wagyu beef pho since always had pho with 'normal' beef. Paid more than twice the price but the experience was not exceptional. The Wagyu beef in Japanese restaurant tasted much more succulent, probably the 'boiled' beef in pho could not bring out the taste like grilled beef. Southern roll with prawn [clear skin roll] was good with the sauce.For ladies, bar counter seats are acceptable because there are hooks under the counter to hang your handbags
4
One of the few places that you can taste fairly authentic pho. The beef pho is very good value. These days, it is rare to see several pieces of thick slices of beef in a bowl of noodles especially at this price.
5
Service was great and the food was great. Would go here again for a bang mi fix. The desserts are great to. Vanilla pudding with some sort of honey on top and fried banana with coconut dipping sauce. Would recommend!
2
I was at Nam Nam @ Wheelock place on 2 Sep 2013. Service was not very good as staff were not very attentive. I had to wait for a while before the waiter noticed me standing at the entrance. I ordered the Quang Style Egg Noodles. It was a disappointment because for about $11, the portion was small & the noodles had a very strong amonia smell. The taste of the noodles was not fantastic too & I couldn't finish my noodles because the smell was making me loose appetite. I definitely will never go back to Nam Nam again.
5
A verly popular little Vietnamese Restaurant with the locals serving mainly soups with lots of side dish choices. Not the cheapest meals on the block but certainly cheaper than in the Hotels or more trendy Malls at higher levels. We found if you go down the escalator near Nam Nam you will find where most of the workers and locals eat for much cheaper prices, if that's what your looking for. Otherwise this restauraant met all our expectations in dinning. Great service although we had to queue to get a seat

This place has been one of my favorite lunch places around orchard. At $10, you get a set meal that will fill you up the whole day. But do expect a long line during weekdays with the set meals.I usually come for the pho soup with sliced beef, and at the table there are additional sauces to cater to your tasting such as fish sauce, chilli oil, and plum sauce. I have to agree with the other reviewers that the soup broth isn't as thick comparing to those that i had in Melbourne. I heard the wagyu pho tasted much better and the beef was softer and smoother than the normal ones, but i haven't tried it yet since, im more than satisfied with normal sliced beef pho. Overall, don't overexcited with them, it's great food, fast service and with $10 lunch set meal, this is really good option around Orchard area

This place in Raffles City always had a queue, so we figured it must be really good. We ate there twice and had the bahn mi the first time and the pho the second time. Both were pleasant, but lacking in flavour and punch compared to the genuine article. The eating experience is also unpleasant as you are packed together and if you're in a party of 2 will have to share a table. The McDonalds of Vietnamese food

We ordered the beef steak pho, stewed beef dry noodles, chicken pho and summer rolls. The pho dishes were delicious - especially the beef slices which were tender. The summer rolls were equally good but a little on the small side for its price. Forget the beef stew noodles - the sauce did not fit the noodles. The venue was a little hectic but we found seats quite easily both times. They have aLoyalty card where you get a free 7th pho

This is my first to tried Pho, I've ordered a mixed beef pho, flower crab noodle, black coffee and lotus tea. The broth is delicious and is very special to first timer like me. Satisfying serving speed and nice staff. Reasonable price. Will definitely visit again to taste all type of Pho and noodle available

We ordered the beef and mixed beef noodles. I must say that this is one of the more authentic taste that we can get in Singapore. Service system needs review. Only one cashier who handles everything. The ice coffee we ordered - kid size. You probably need 2-3 servings. Nevertheless, I will visit again for the food

First time dining in a branch in Raffles City. A rare gem. Managed by Les Amis, one of Spore premier food group.Delicious array of Vietnamese pho (noodle in soup) & bahn mi (baguette). Cant decide what to eat. Thick & aromatic coffee with condensed milk a must try. Has loyalty card for patrons. A few branches already. We had Wagyu beef pho at SGD 16!Staff are helpful, friendly and seems to enjoy theurvwork. Great work.Had a wonderful time. Will return

I visited the place three time, tried the soup, noddles and the sandwich. What a treat. Vietnamese food rocks!

The queue starts at 11am. The offering is limited. Once you have ordered and paid the food arrives quickly.
Don't bother with the starters, just order the pho.
The sandwiches are not worth it and not terribly good.

Excellent Vietnamese food at a very resonable price located in the lower floor of Ion shopping centre near Orchard Rd MRTstation. Quick Cheap and Tasty Food.

The place has typical Vietnamese food, pho and baguette sandwich. Their picutre menu looked good. But if you expect REAL Vietnamese food, you would not like their food. I had a lunch set and chose beef pho and ice coffee. It comes with springroll. Ice coffee was not very strong. It is sweet but real Vietnamese coffee should have more bitterness. Pho was disappointing as it came with no herb at all! I didn't expect variety of herb like you get in Vietnam, but not even beansprouts was added. Springroll, likewise, should have more vegetable and herb inside. There is no slice of meat inside either. Mainly it was filled with noodle and thin slice of boiled shrimp and piece of egg. $9.9 for lunch set is a good value. If you don't care for herb, it may be okay

Nam Nam has a fantastic lunch set - pho, fresh spring rolls, and a Vietnamese iced coffee, all for under $10. Quite a bargain for Singapore. The pho is pretty good too -- good lime flavor, not too salty, good rice noodles. Despite the crowds (it's quite popular at the moment) service is fast enough to make for a good weekday lunch -- I was in and out in 30 minutes

The 2 of us chanced upon this funky noodle bar in raffles city and decided to try their core offering of the following;1. The baguette with pork balls had a nice crispy dough but one bite and it was sorely disappointing....absolutely tasteless baguette, no butter, no aroma, nothing. And the meat balls were so little, we were eating dough most of the time. Awful. We didn't finish it.2. The beef noodles came in a std chicken based soup,,,,taste was alright but the beef was tough though it was sliced laser thin...a sign of using inferior beef.3. We ordered young coconut drink. First time that I see the husk of the young coconut being so bulletproof thick,,,,this is as old as it can get.4. And to save the worst for last, the fried bananas aka goreng Pisano with some kind of vanilla sauce,,,,the flour used was utterly wrong And the banana tasted sour,,,wrong on all counts. Any 50cts goreng Pisang is Singapore would taste better than this intrepid And dismal offering.Most people mentioned value for money. Not for such awful stuff. Won't visit again. This brings discredit to the wonderful world of Vietnamese cuisine

Its the place to go if you are craving for comfort foodIt is a simple noodle soup with a good quality of beef. 2 times we've been here and service was good.Decor is unique and location is convinience.Will recommend this place to more friends

Had lunch there with a colleague.Was wary of the queue which had about 20 people, but it moved quite fast and we got a table within 15-20 mins. You have to queue for a table, then write your order and queue again at the cashier, but they are quite fast and we were in and out of the restaurant within 45mins which I consider good. But I guess if you have a bigger group, it might take longer to get a table/Had the set lunch which includes the rice vermicelli rolls, a bowl of pho beef noodles and iced coffee (you can also choose iced tea, hot coffee/tea, or mineral water). The skin of the rolls are quite hard but the ingredients are fresh. The beef wasn't too bad and the noddles were so so. I would go back again for the set lunch ($9.90) but might think twice about the noodles, especially the beef special, which includes various type of beef (sliced, beef balls, etc) but costs (if I remember correctly) $16.90+

I cant help but be attracted to the smell coming from the Nam nam noodles bar at Raffles city outlet, basement level everytime i pass by there. It really smells great from the outside that you wanna go inside and try their food. Its not expensive in my opinion as you can eat a bowl of pho for less than $10. Choices wise... not alot of options. As for the taste.... the soup was yummy if you like sweet and sour based soup. As for the noodles and ingredients... it was quite normal. I ordered Sliced Chicken Pho and the chicken was abit dry to me. So overall, its normal to me
