We got the seafood pancake ala carte, and a chicken bulgolgi dinner set which comes with free flow side dishes. Pancake was good, bulgolgi was nothing special.

This place is located in the basement of Far East Plaza in the bag. We were a bit disappointed in the food as we were expecting (and had a hunger for) good Korean food. The kimchee soup was a bit diluted and squid undercooked. Service was decent and pricing too high for the quality of food provided

This is the Korean restaurant we always been to because is reasonable prices and nice. Located at Far East Plaza basement corner, they served for lunch & dinner. During weekday have special set lunch was very good price and can refill for those of the side dishes. Very good for simple lunch for 2 person having..

Went about 5 times, tried their BBQ, Soondubu and fried Saba fish. There're abt 8-10 side dishes (self-service and free flow). Most of the items on the menu were $9.80nett. The higher prices are the army stew (Budaejiggae) which is meant for 3-4 pax sharing anyway. Have been their regular since opening cheap and good

Outside of Korea itself, I've had really good Korean food in two places on the planet, Los Angeles (I've already reviewed it) and now here in Singapore. I ordered the marinated boneless ribs and are they ever delicious. All the side dishes you would expect in a Korean restaurant plus good Korean beer. Love this place and I will be back

Been here a few times in the past. Today, with a group of 4. We decided to have the a la carte buffet BBQ lunch. It's priced reasonably, with pork, beef, chicken, prawns thrown in together with one selection of soup, with ramen or rice. Vegetables, n sides were plentiful.Staff was very attentive & willAlways assist us whenever we needed help.Overall, a decent n good value for money, I will have no hesitation to re visit again soon.Keep it up. Keep your good staff selling well for you.

Seldom eat Korean BBQ food but I find it not so bad.Meat dishes are good. Should go for the buffet so that you can have unlimited meat dishes.Staff will help to BBQ the food but you have to keep a lookout on the food just in case it is over-cooked like mine.

I tried their BBQ pork, it was tender and flavourful. The side dishes were good too.

We had passed by this restaurant many times but never try it. Today we decided to.The place is not very big, with simple settings but comfortable. It is located in a nice quiet stretch of Far East Plaza Level 1- a good, peaceful environment. The food- for mains, we ordered both the Cold Soup Noodle & Korean Spicy Soup ( Beef). While waiting for it to be ready, we were served 8 side dishes.Verdict: The side dishes generally taste bland & the types given are not as nice nor good as in other Korean restaurants that we have tried. Except for the Kimchi, the rest are not nice.Both the main courses taste so-so. There were "hardly any beef at all for the Korean Spicy Soup. Definitely the food is not as good as many others places that we have tried. Would rate it right at the bottom of our experiences.Prices however seems reasonable. But if there were so little meat in the mains ( like my Spicy Soup), then really it is not worth it.Service-wise, the staff were attentive throughout & generally provides a good service.This will definitely be our first & last visit

Great meals here, service and staff delightful. We were amused at what we though we're two mints on a tiny plate on our table. The girl came with a little jug and sprinkled them with water and up popped our two hand towels. What a giggle we had. Of course had seen them before, we just were not expecting it then. Great meal

This is a korean BBQ. I made the mistake of not sticking to bbq. I ordered Chicken bulgogi and it came floating in oil and the meat was smelly. The accompaniments came in over 6-8 small plates and were all wonderful. Though unhappy, I would like to go back to try the bbq. Suggest you stick to bbq

Used to come here for lunches two years ago and decided to return for dinner. Very good dinner BBQ dinner buffet with generous serving potions. Meat were fresh and nicely marinated. Nice side dishes as usual. Brought an Aussie friend here and she loved it. Glad to be back

Was just a usual shopping trip. No intention to seek good food. But ended up with a pleasant surprise.Not exactly the most economical place to have Korean BBQ, but food was fresh and complete. Service staff was friendly, patient and smiley. To my standard, patience is the most important factor for service staff working in Korean BBQ restaurant, because customers (us) will keep asking for another plate of this and that and this and that.... heh. Which is normal isn't it?As we stood up to leave, everyone including the busy chef behind the kitchen counter shouted thank you and goodbye in Korean. I don't think every place would do that...It's really a nice place for all occasion. Family, couple date, friends gathering, it's a great place I think. The place is spacious. Will definitely return. Not for the food, really no biggie, but for the ambiance. Good. :

We lived in the Far East Plaza Residence and were looking for something different for dinner on the first night upon arriving to Singapore. The Korean BBQ buffet that we ordered turned out to be a really pleasant meal. The meat served were really fresh and tender and there was an abundance of refillable side dishes that went with the meal. Each of us also ordered a portion of hot soup served in stone bowls that stayed warm throughout the night. We thought it was really a value for money and the staff were there to help us with grilling the meat. As expected of the professionals, they constantly came to check on the grill and made sure it was cooked to perfection. Never letting it stay even a second longer than it should. The watermelon pieces cut into little hearts were the cutest thing.We were really pampered and it was definitely a wonderful meal to start our holiday in Singapore

This is not my first non last to dine here.Food is reasonable priced and up to taste.Have both a la carte,set or buffet.Staff will help you BBQ ,if you order BBQ item.Try set menu if you not a great eater,bcoz buffet ,they don't have beef ...only pork and chicken

We opted for the bbq set menu which appeared good value. This included two a la carte dishes so we opted for soup to start. This was hot, spicy and delicious. A selection of raw meat then arrived which included pork, chicken and beef. The idea was then to cook our own meat over tbe bbq in the middle of the table. It was great fun and tasty, despite burning the chicken! There was a selection of dishes to accompany the meats which were refilled when empty. The cost was &48 for two which included drinks, tax and service charge. Service was friendly and efficien

Situated on a convenient and easily accessible area of Far East Plaza, this cozy restaurant serves hearty Korean fare, with all the usual "must-haves" you expect of Korean cuisine on the menu. A usual favourite to start the meal would be with their seafood onion pancake, then proceed on to bibimbap, barbecue meats and of course, the ginseng chicken soup. The menu have sets meals with good inclusion of the BBQ meats (just 1 helping), bibimbap and the ginseng chicken and drinks. Service is brisk and reasonable good except that during peak period, do expect some slow-down. That is highly due to the restaurant lateral longish layout and corners, etc, which may hinder service staff vision. Have patience...have a great meal...give them a break
