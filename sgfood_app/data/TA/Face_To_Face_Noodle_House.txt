A typical mall stall in Singapore, which means it quite good. The crab stuffed crab shells and the bacon wrapped cheese ball were both to die for. Our main dishes were also very good. I recommend this place.

Service is acceptable.
Over cook noodle and all broken as on picture.
Cendol is not nice.
Sour plum drink doesn't have much plum taste.

This is my first time here, but love the quality and price of the food. Apparently it is a fav of my family and their kids. Nice combo meals and I especially like the soup noodles especially the spicy Sichuan one

Oh one more thing, their soya milk! Heaven!

@TheKuoKnowsIf you have never had noodles made using the Jook Sing technique, then you have to give this place a try.A good bowl of noodles has to start with good pasta. And Jook Sing or Rising Bamboo is a century-old technique that uses the tensile strength of bamboo in the kneading process.The proof of the kneading is in the eating. The noodles have an springiness that is reminiscent of Hong Kong noodles of the past.The signature Traditional Sarawak Kolo Mee is the perfect way to enjoy Jook Sing noodles. A generous heping of char siu, deep fried wontons and a helping of mince pork are a match made in heaven.I only happened on Face to Face by chance. But it will now be one of my go-to places for comfort food

I was intro by one friend of mine to give a try their noodle. They got signature chili dry ban mee. For me, the taste got nothing other than spicy. If i need to eat in this restaurant again, I would prefer their Ko Lo Mee

Most authentic tasting Sarawak Laksa in Singapore, bar none, as declared by a true Sarawakian aka my wife. The Kolo Noodles is more styled towards the Hokkchew group like in Sibu, but still authentic enough to be branded "Sarawak" Kolo Noodles. Please give the place a try if you are trying to find a different version of noodles from what you can find in Singapore

This eatery in City Square Mall is a good find. The noodles are chewy , there are good portions of condiments and for the spicy food lovers, the hot and spicy Level 3&4 are just the thing to try! Beware, it's really spicy and hot! I tried the Level 3 and found it a it of a struggle to finish it all without feeling my stomach and mouth on fire. Prices are bit pricey though.

Had lunch with my daughter at Face to Face. Ordered the Traditional Sarawak Noodles which came with tangy noodles - had the perfect texture and bite. The homemade mince pork sauce and char siew gave the noodles an added enriching kampong taste. Char Siew is moist and well-barbequed. Vegetables were fresh and the soup tasted home-cooked. Brought back memories of yesteryears. Authentically traditional, especially the chilli paste

The location is easily found, the place look cosy and nice to dine in. The staff is very friendly and helpful, Amway on look out for customers in need of help.Order a value meal with consist of House specialty pan mee with fried taucu wing and honey lemon which cost $10.90, is very value for money. The noodle soup is very tasty, and the noodle is very smooth and nice. The best is the chilli, if you are chilli lover it is a must try, it is spicy and at the same time is very fragrance

Simple, clean environment. No service charge and GST. Springy noodles that go well with the crispy anchovies and minced meat. The chili flakes were served separately, so we can add according to individual liking.

The traditional serawak noodles are quite lovely and springy and just hit the spot after a workout. The price is quite good as well around 9 sgd per portion.

Had Genki Herbal Chicken Soup and the portion is pretty decent. Soup was filled with herbs unlike some other restaurants that serves substandard quality herbal soup. Though a lil pricey, but i guess the scarcity of such good food warrants a try at the very least

Tried the hot & spicy pan mee! The pan-fried dry chili adds a crispy touch to the noodles and I must say that it goes so well with the noodles! Definitely a good treat for a tired soul~^^ The environment was clean and cosy as well, so it was a great spot to chill and catch up with a friend. Will be back to try other menus soon

The noodles had a good bite to it and it was well coated in the seasoned oil with a generous portion of roasted meat and minced meat. The noodles had a good flavour but it was a bit too oily. The dry chilli condiments had a uniquely charred taste and it added a crispy texture to each bite

Having heard about the famous Face to Face Noodles House hailing from Malaysia, and with its first overseas franchise here in Singapore, I was curious to see what the hype was about. It is conveniently tucked away in City Square Mall (just next to Farrer Park MRT) at the corner of Level 2. The decor cut a relaxing ambience, perfect after a long day at work. Picked the Hot and Spicy Pan Mee as part of a Value Combo Set ($10.90), which included a side dish and a drink. The friendly staff even recommended the type of noodles that would go well with my choice. Within just 10 minutes, the full set arrived. The generous ingredients- anchovies (ikan bilis), minced meat and onsen egg- were impeccably arranged in the bowl. After mixing everything, the soft-boiled egg enveloped the noodles, giving it a subtle richness and yellowish hue. The handmade egg noodles, cooked al-dente, were pleasantly springy while the ikan bilis being delightfully crispy, contributed to the faint salty crunch in each bite. The minced meat gave a nice balance of sweet and savoury with none of that gamey smell. Be sure to toss in a dash of their house special dry chilli (served separately) for that extra oomph. After a few spoonfuls, it was clear why these noodles warranted such popularity across the Causeway. The noodles were also complemented with a side of two fried taucu wings which were coated with a layer of marinate over the tender chicken meat. The refreshing drink of iced Honey Lemon wasn't too sweet and it capped off a comforting and delectable meal. I'd strongly recommend Face to Face noodles to assuage your handmade noodles craving at a reasonable cost!

Overall food presentation was good. Seating environment is quite spacious and conducive. Not much waiting time so efficiency is good! I like the skin of the fishcake as it is well fried and yet not too greasy. Suprisingly I quite like the pork in the pan mee noodle even though i am not a fan of pork! I guess I like it mainly because of the brasied sauce and the type of pork used. It is not minced so you get to taste the tenderness of the shredded lean pork. so it's good for lean pork lovers too

Really enjoyed the food at face to face, the noodles was very springy and not overcooked.I especially liked the pork inside the traditional Sarawak noodle, it was very tender and flavorful. But my favorite dish would have to be the bacon cheese balls, simply mouth watering
