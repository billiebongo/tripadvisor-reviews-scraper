The roast pig is the best thing ever. Service is great, food is great. Feels like a traditional chinese restaurant

Located in the heart of Chinatown & next to many shopping centers & shops, the place offers an alternative dining place for large groups of people. Good food in prime location.

Was here for a birthday dinner. Booked a room with ktv and 2big tables. Food tasted good like any other restaurant. Service was good though. Ingredients were fresh. Ambiance was perfect. Dishes came one by one slowly, could be faster a little.

I have book 2 table for dinner for Monday 26 Feb 2018. We request for private room with KTV when the booking was done.Yan Palace Hong Lim Complex, accepted the booking and confirmation with deposit collected. Guest was invited with the information that KTV was included in the dinnerOn the day of dinner, we were lead to the main hall with 2 tables in the main hall, and separated by the walkway. When I approach the supervisor regarding this booking, they push the blame to us claiming that, they informed us that there is no room available and we have heard the booking wrongly. To add fuel to the fire, the manager Joyce Thng say your table price is $498++ has no rom ok. Now my question is that 1. Is it a mistake that we choose the $498++, that why we wasn’t given a room?2. At the point of booking when you accepted our deposit and confirm our booking why did you back out on us? Was it because someone else who paid a higher table price took our seats and we were push to the main hall?The manager offer us no alternative solution, she only show us an attitude face, apologize unwillingly and tell me “if you are not happy, you can email and complain”To Mr. Wong and Mr. Ng, owner of Yan Palace, this is not the way of business. Don’t ever think that your business is always good. Your business is good is because we have supported your restaurant over the years. But after today, my guest and I have decided that, this will be the last time we will patronize your restaurant. Even if I golf at Warren, I will drive my guest out to other restaurant as Yan palace has no basic etiquette of business to begin with. I urge anyone who wishes to eat in this restaurant, please think twice, and never believe in their phone call arrangement. Even if their manager confirm with you verbally. As they will bounce you once there is higher paying customer

Went there with family for a dim sum lunch. Service is good and restaurant place is big. Food wise is about same as many other dim sum deli or restaurants. No one particular dish that attracted me or my favourite as they are just normal as others that I had eaten. Certain dishes are quite salty to my taste, so is to my parents but this is individual preference.

Room #3, a Private room with 15 pax. & Karaoke systems. It was sound proof.But the dishes were superb starting with the first Yu-Sheng Toast (an Early first this year 2018) Good health & another smooth year ahead.The second were steam Fins with chicken Broth - now after this dish each of us could hardly eat more. The dishes big serving & good in taste (we were waiting for the monosodium glutamide to set in but none even after the 8 dish. The glutinous rice definitely have these. Our dessert, white fungus in hot lightly sweetened. Many of us took a menu & card. We will be back next Monday 22nd

We were here for a birthday celebration. We ordered their speciality dish: Pipa Roast Duck. It was delicious. But the rest of the dishes were average. The yam dessert was a bit too watery. But overall service was good and the ambience was nice. The duck is a must try for first time visitors

Was taken here for a meal. We ordered a set menu. It was a very tasty meal light in sauces and more southern Chinese either Cantonese or Chaozhou. The ambience was electric as there was a huge private party there on a Sunday night. A very typical old style restaurant tucked away in a complex. The service was good, polite though not necessarily attentive. Come here for a different experience

Arrived right on dot at 10 am on a Sunday and soon see crowds coming in is a sign of how well known and accepted the restaurant is.We were seated quickly and handed over a sheet of dim sum which I had at a first glance thought I was wrong as the price is very reasonable.Most of the items are within $5 and very quickly we made our choice and I was glad most of the items came in adequate size despite the reasonable price.Some items which stood up in my views is the 烧卖 and 叉烧酥 which is one of the better ones I have tasted.We went for mainly steamed items which did not disappoint except the chicken feet which is quite salty to my liking. The congee is another let down because with such a small bowl it does not do justice to the price.Overall a very good experience as you get quality dim sum and reasonable price

Had patronised this dim sum restaurant for the first time, based on my colleague's suggestion.We ordered their siew mai pork dumpling and steamed kar kaw which were nice.Their century egg with pork porridge was also tasty.The BBQ Char Siew puff was barely decent, as the crust was rather hard instead of flaky.One of our favourite dish was the prawn ball with almond crust.We also had their cheong fun with prawn.We tried their prawn roll with banana, which was also moorish.We do not recommend their steamed custard bun, which had a stiff and clumpy filling.Their carrot cake was nothing outstanding.A rather decent dim sum lunch with colleagues, of around $53 for 3 pax.Their interesting Chinese tea of Ju Pu was nice (blend of chrysanthemum and pu er tea)

I was surprised by the quality of the food...was very good and affordable. We requested for the birthday promo set including a KTV room and there is no taxes charged (no GST & taxes)!

Yan Palace in Hong Lim Complex is an old traditional Chinese Restaurant still serving nice tasty food. Service is not the best as expected from the old restaurant

Choose 2 kind of roasted meat platter only for $12. Very generous portion and it is value for money and taste good.
The dim sum is just average. Service is okay. They do have lunch set menu. It was quite crowded during lunch hour.

Great food convenient location, a tradition Chinese restaurant that is suitable for family as well as business dining!

Since they last renovated the restaurant, the standard of the food is getting much better. Try Double-Boiled Soup, Pan Fried Cod Fish in Soy Sauce and Chinese "Rojak in Yam Basket". Don't think you can find another restaurant in Singapore that serve Rojak in their way. Dim sum is also available. Spacious restaurant but hardly 100% full except for Chinese New Year period

If you are looking for authentic chinese food, then this is your restaurant. No airs and graces, and very little English, but very happy to help, and clearly the food is the real deal as this restaurant was primary filled with chinese. Yan Palace is considered an institution for China Town and has been operating for a very long time. It is a realistic experience

Went there for business dinner during the CNY and we had about 6 tables. Staffs are attentive, however i think they need to improve their english as there can be non-chinese patrons too. The cuisines are delicious. Location of the palace is kinda 10 mins walk from Chinatown MRT

I was invited to attend a traditional Chinese New Year lunch banquet at this restaurant. The food and service were pretty good. It's right next to Exit F of Chinatown MRT station (North East and Downtown lines). This place would probably be fine for family get togethers. They have seating for about 400 people and coped well with the full house at the event I attended

Have been to this older dining establishment for many years with my parents. This is a favourite amongst the older generation. However, given their non-existent service and generally average Cantonese food, i could never understand why this is such a hit with the local. A recent experience at this restaurant has made me finally to decide that was the final visit. Reservation made at the restaurant was not honored and any walk-in would be given a place earlier than those who made the reservations. Spoken to the manager and it was the "if you want a table, wait for it. Do not disturb me" Totally aghast at such service attitude. Totally not worth the wait at all

Just had a dinner there and enjoyed the feast. They serve somewhat traditional Chinese food. I enjoyed roast duck in a wrap. The skin of the duck was crispy and it was great. Overall, the food was great, but the interior is bit old fashioned.The service is prompt enough.I do not mind coming back
