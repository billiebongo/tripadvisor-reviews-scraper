Got a lunch deal here today! Unlimited cold green tea and a bowl of ramen for S$10! It was delicious. Can’t complain.

Took two small boys for dinner and we had so much fun. Staff were friendly and very helpful. Food was delicious. Small and cosy with great location in the hustle and bustle. Beer was cold. Will definitely recommend and come again

This interesting place has great okonomiyaki. You can cook it by yourself or request the waiter to cook for you. They provided instructions of how to cook and you can put the sauce and topping according to your taste. It's very unique experience!On top of that, the serving is excellent

This was a fun night’s dining that we stumbled upon. After initially stopping in for a beer on the rooftop terrace, we stayed in for dinner. Although we didn’t have the okonomiyaki, we ordered a seafood Teppanyaki, we did have a great time with deliciously fresh food. The set consisted of oysters, scallops, squid, prawns, and tuna sashimi. All the Seafood was fresh and the hot plate allowed us to cook our meal to our tastes. We ordered a side of lamb and that too was fresh, although a little pricey at $12 for 6 slices. The seafood platter was good value at $48, as it was enough for two people. Accompanied with a few beers and some sake, the price overall was reasonable. The service was generally great although, as it was busy, a waitress almost gave our table away to another group, before another waiter corrected her and seated us. All in all, it’s a fun experience, with lovely fresh food and we’ll definitely be back for more.

They really are a high quality restaurant, and the food is excellent. My only beef with them is that they require the customer to cook their own food. I know this is supposed to be a cultural thing, but frankly, when I go out to dinner, I like to sit back and be served up delicious food without being asked to also cook it. Yes, they will sometimes do the cooking in front of you if you insist, but nonetheless, it takes away from the relaxed easy atmosphere I prefer in a restaurant.The food is top quality - no doubt about that. And if you order one of the dishes they cook for you, you do get to sit back and quaff a beer in comfort.The staff are very friendly and helpful

A feel of Japanese culture as you walk in. Not a big restaurant, 8 square tables fit within the space and playing Japanese song. A good place after a day of hard work. I am having ramen tonight, after a hectic work. The signature ramen is good (SGD10). Nice portion. I also order a bottle of beer (SGD8). Price is reasonable. They also serves teppanyaki and other noodle and rice. The items on menu kind of limited. But it is a just nice for a small shop. This place is air-conditioned. Friendly staffs.

My friend recommended Seiwaa for its Okonomiyaki and I realized why when I visited this place. It's only about 5 mins walk from Rochor MRT - so easily accessible. They have this whole list of Okonomiyakis that you can prepare right on your table top. If you do not want to take the risk of cooking, you can watch the skillful chefs doing it. The staff is extremely warn and friendly and the food very delicious. The ambiance is chilled out with nice Japanese music playing in the background as wel

The full name of the restaurant is Seiwaa Okonomiyaki & Teppanyaki Restaurant. It is a very small authentic Japanese restaurant but it has seats on the rooftop as well. We saw the sign when we are leaving so did not get to try it. We ordered the Seafood (Prawns and Squid) Okonomiyaki and requested the staff to cook for us. They encourage us to try cooking on our own with the instructions and guidance given. It was quite fun and the grill is in front of you. The staff was friendly and service was good despite being peak dinner hours on a Saturday. We also ate the delicious mentai Salmon which is a small portion for $20 and gyoza dumplings (5pcs). The green tea was refillable. The okonomiyaki tasted quite fresh but was a bit bland for me although I added chilli powder on it too. Overall, it was an interesting experience but really nothing to draw me for a return visit

Saw some reviews on the DIY okonomiyaki and decided to give it a try (thinking it's just a gimmick). Food turned out to be amazingly good. Simple dish, but the fresh ingredients make all the difference. Prices were affordable as well, especially with the Citibank 20% off promo..The staffs were super friendly.. Kept checking in with us, which is very useful as it's DIY and we weren't sure if it's done right..We had the mixed okonomiyaki and the yaki soba. Will definitely be going back for more. Tip: remember to make a reservation, as seats are quite limited

Cheap beer coupled with friendly staff makes this whole experience a joy. Food is amazingly nice and its even more fun when you can cook the meal yourself. I would recommend you try the Monja and it goes very well with beer. This place has also a beautiful roof terrace to chill out
