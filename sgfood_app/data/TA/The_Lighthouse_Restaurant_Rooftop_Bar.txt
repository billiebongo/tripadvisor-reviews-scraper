Had the 4 course light dinner during a business trip to Singapore.
Beef tenderloin is delicious and goes well with wine. With the view looking at the Sands, it's quite nice.
5
We were served by Mr Prakash for our recent visit to celebrate our wedding anniversary and we couldn’t have asked for better service and quality of food.
Thank you for making our special day even more special!

Lovely cocktails - get up there early if you want a table to watch the light show at 8pm. Nice staff, breezy sometimes but a great city view without being too high!
5
Excellent menu, great food, and great service (by Rey). Also a great view. Only negatives are that the wine is expensive. The fries came already (very) salted. Also my pasta with lobster could have been hotter. But otherwise, this is a good restaurant
5
I'm writing this review to express our wonderful experience with my wife when we had our memorable dinner, food was really good especially the lobster and tuna tartare, first time to experience a tartare that comes in a little sorbet, but definitely our night was completely perfect because the service given by Rey, he made us very important guest, very attentive and he make sure that we are enjoying our dinner, we will definitely comeback and tell it to our friends. Would like to mention Oleksandra as she makes our reservation even thought it was last minute, Raffy and Ian at the rooftop bar was very friendly and makes very good drink as well Chef Carlo who even go out and greet eveyone to each tables

I brought my wife to The Lighthouse to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary on 30 Jan 2018. We ordered a 5-course set dinner. The food was very delicious and well presented. It was one of the best Italian Restaurant we ever tried. We especially like the Burrata Cheese appetizer, Pasta & Lobster entree, Cod Fish, Spring Chicken and Beef Tenderloin main courses. The night view facing Marina Bay area was fantastic. Thank you so much to Oleksandra, Rey and Prakash for your hospitality and great service and helping to take lots of photos for us. We were really surprised when you presented us with two lovely teddy bears, a nice cake and a personalized card with our photo for our wedding anniversary. We were so touched and happy. Thank you once again for giving us such an enjoyable night. We will definitely come back again with our children.
5
First thing to note was that the service was impeccable. The staff were attentive to details and genuinely cares about the diners. One person to compliment is definitely Olexsandra. I informed her it was a birthday dinner for my guest and she surprised him with a delicious chocolate cake. Food was wonderful as well, Had the Tortelli Di Burrata. The dish didn't disappoint whether in terms of plating or taste. Definitely a place to return to with your loved ones. It's easy to find good food these days, but it's almost impossible to find such meticulous service these days.Kudos to Olexsandra once again

Staff - SUPER Friendly5 Course Degustation Dinner - DOPEView - DOPECame here for a casual dinner with the lady only having heard good reviews about The Lighthouse. Never really trusted restaurant reviews, but now, I’m really writing this up to those who are reading this right now, THIS PLACE IS WORTH YOUR TIME & MONEY!
5
Cocktails at rooftop bar, excellent service and fantastic view.Then delicious food in restaurant very attentive service from Amy and Rey. I don't like raw prawns so chef cooked them for me for the appetiser, nothing was too much trouble. Perfect last night in Singapore. We will be returning next year. Thank you for a wonderful evenin

Rooftop Bar has amazing views of Singapore. Dined in the Lighthouse last night. service excellent, views also amazing, food not what we expected. Definitely not value for money I'm afraid. I think it depends what you order! Starter of pasta and beef was ok, but luke warm. Chicken was nice but again not amazing, two small bits with some mustard mash and that was it. No dessert. Staff were attentive and service was excellent. Would I go back, no
5
Fantastic experience. Excellent food and service. Great view of the bay, light show and fireworks. Good ambiance.
5
We were there for my Dad's birthday and the manager, Mr. Prakesh and his team were kind and helpful to arrange for the celebration.The team was professional and attentive, not to mention the food was also very delicious.We will definitely come back to this place again for the nice ambience, food and service! =

Had bubbly to celebrate my husband’s birthday. Ambience can’t be beat! Great view of the Marina Bay Sands and the city; refreshing as it was on a rooftop outdoors. Only thing is they botched up my reservation (I wanted a particular table that looked out into the bay and took great pains to specify this when I phoned in my reservation. They confirmed they would hold the table for me but then gave it to someone else) so they seated us at one of the other tables for half an hour before moving us to our preferred seat. Drinks and food are a bit pricey but well worth a special occasion. If you decide to try it out, reconfirm your reservation to make sure everything is in order

We did some research online and decide on this place for Birthday celebration. The service was nice and the staff served us very well. We are lucky to taste food done from Michelin Star Chef which was awesome. Overall, with the high prices you pay, you will certainly get a nice Singapore downtown night view. We missed the sunset view as that day was rainy evening but we definitely will pay our visit in the near future
3
I’m certain you pay the high prices here just for the view. The service was impeccable, view wonderful but the food was not up to silver service.We ordered the Burrata cheese for an entree between three people, which was served with a bread basket, the cheese & bread both very good. For our mains we ordered the rack of lamb, gnocchi & angel hair pasta with Maine lobster. Our mains took over one hour to come out after the entree. They served two of the main meals but my pasta took another ten minutes to come out. Hence, the lamb was overdone, the gnocchi was ok, my pasta had no flavour & only three tiny morsels of lobster. The timing & serving of the meals was totally unacceptable for a high class restaurant. The waiters did apologise numerous times about the delays. Unfortunately the S$237 bill at the end made the experience even more disappointing. Definitely wouldn’t come back unless somebody else is going to pay the bill, so......... I guess........ that would give them a chance to redeem themselves in the kitchen
5
My husband and myself did some research online and decided on this place for our 1st yr wedding anniversary dinner. From the moment we stepped in till we left, all I can say is everything was splendid! The service was impeccable and food was delicious (keep in mind portions are rather small since it's fine dining but prices are pretty ok). Well even if anything goes wrong, the cosy ambience & view is there to safe the day. To the outstanding staff; Oleksandra, Rey and Shara & restaurant manager Mr Prakash, thank you so much for your dedication and professionalism. We truly enjoyed our dinner. Thanks for the memorable experience.

We saved our visit to the Lighthouse until just before our departure from the Fullerton Hotel. Just a quick two floors up and no worries about the weather or having to find a taxi. The restaurant is quite small but is cleverly set out with strategically placed mirrors giving the illusion of space. The restaurant commands a view across Marina Bay to the Marina Bay Sands and at the right time you can also enjoy the laser light show across the water while you eat. Essentially this restaurant is Italian themed and while the menu is relatively small there is something there to satisfy many tastes.To start, my wife chose the gnocchi and I chose the Tortelli Di Burrata and for the mains we chose the fish and the beef tenderloin. Neither of us was disappointed. We ordered a bottle of Pighin Pinot grigio, which was excellent, and we finished with limoncello to cleanse the palate.All the staff were attentive but not intrusive. We thoroughly enjoyed our evening
5
I went there with a friend and our daughters for a small birthday celebration. The staff was very friendly, the service was great, the atmosphere perfect. The food was really, really good. The restaurant provided a small birthday cake and even sang "Happy birthday". Highly recommended if you are looking for a special place to have a meal.The view to Marina Bay is great
5
The service, the food, the atmosphere is all beyond words. The staff are all incredibly welcoming and inviting and make you feel so special. Please go to the skybar as well and ask Raffy for a Singapore Sling! I dined at the Lighthouse for my 30th birthday and all the staff made it really memorable for me. I can't wait to come back when I am in Singapore again
5
We were staying at the Fullerton Hotel and decided to book in here for dinner due to travel and a long journey. The rooftop bar has amazing scenes and the restaurant below is just as good. The food and window table were perfect and the staff were very attentive! Highly recommended!!!
5
The staff was impeccable in their service and attentiveness. The food was good but not fantastic. More than made up for it with the great view and private environment.
4
We only went up here for drinks, but it is a fun and unusual venue for a cocktail. Great views and cocktail menu with an Italian twist.
4
We had lunch at the Lighthouse and really enjoyed our experience. The staff were friendly and the service was evidene of an experienced polished team. The view around Singapore is lovely too. All three of us loved our meals. The snapper was cooked perfectly, the lobster pasta devine, the ragu some of the best, and the berry dessert worth coming back for alone. The wine list is extensive. This is fine dining experience with a definite business lunch feel. Reasonably priced too. Recommend if you’d like adult fine dining experience without the hefty price ta
5
If you are lucky you'll get a table beside the window to see the laser show from there. But if not don't care you'll get exquisite Italian dishes cooked by an Italian chef and a perfect service team led by Mr Prakash will take care of you
4
View is great, probably better at night than at lunch. Lunch deals are decent, food is good, nothing to complain but given the prices it was also nothing to write home about. Location is nice though and lends itself for a special occasion, service was goo
3
Booked for view - excelllent service, greeting, handling of reservation.. Food fine however not great for price. Unfortunately very cold air conditioner and long delays between courses made for uncomfortable seating
1
This bar would not allow us in as it was booked for a private function, as was the Post Bar. It would have been nice if they had told us when we booked that we could not have a drink anywhere
5
We had our wedding anniversary’s dinner. The restaurant provided us with a compliment cake as per requested without charge. Very friendly and helpful staffs. Romantic ambience and excellent foods
5
Came here for dinner with a friend two days ago to celebrate my birthday. Had the four-course meal. Mr Prakash, the restaurant manager, is very friendly and professional when taking our orders and occasionally check if everything is ok. Service was excellent! And I had a memorable meal that night!
5
We tried twice to make a reservation and succeded the third time. The restaurant is located on the top floor of the Fullerton hotel. Once we are in we realise how small the place is. Maximum 40 seats and a lot of private functions. ..... we are in december. OK that explains it. Service is to fast but very professional. We have to slow them down. The food is excellent. The wine list is extensive but not one bottle below 100 SGD. If you are ready to pay the price you will have a great time with a nice view. Dont forget to go outside before or after supper and have a drink looking at the illuminated marina bay. Overall we had a very nice time
5
Great ambience and view to celebrate special occasions. Good service provided too. Special menus on certain occasions.
5
This is steeped in history and charm and worth a visit even just for the views. It is a stunning place and the views are out of this world. Ask for a window table so you get the whole effect. Authentic Italian food and views what more could you ask for
5
Anniversary celebration dinner at the restaurant. Warmly greeted by friendly Sandra - who also ushered us during our past 2 visits. Restaurant Manager - Prakash welcomed us personally at our table and we were attended by Shara, who was very knowledgeable about the dishes on the menu. After knowing our dietary preferences,she gave us good recommendations for our meal,and even helped to customize it,so that we could enjoy the signature dishes within our constraints - so thoughtful!Throughout the meal, we were offered a personal touch by Prakash,making us feel special.Pleasant surprise organised by the team - an anniversary dessert and gift for our memories!Service has always taken priority over food for us - in this case both food and service were tip top!The team was attentive,thoughtful,dedicated and always working around customers' interests in mind.Special thanks to the team - Prakash,Sandra and Shara ,who made our celebration extra memorable ! We'll certainly be back again
4
The food took quite a long time to be ready to be served, which is a huge setback. We made our order at around 7:30pm. By 8:15PM, we had eaten the appetizer and entree, waited until 9 PM then only the Main was served. Other tables were having the same issues. Most of the time, everyone is just looking at the empty table, wondering when the food will come. Ordered a medium rare beef tenderloin, but was given rare. Quite disappointed
5
Fabulous food! Excellent service! Wine selections was spot on! Though I little pricey but the whole environment and view complemented the food. The wonderful service compensated sufficiently for the expensive dinner though!
5
Celebrated my girlfriend’s first birthday at this awesome restaurant. Have to really commend on their excellent service
5
Wonderful visit from the start! Setting perfect, excellent river view. Staff very attentive but not intrusive and food brilliant. Steak was the best we've ever eaten and the whole meal was faultless. Made our evening and our anniversary an occasion to remember. Thank you 
5
Arriving at the top floor of The Fullerton Hotel the Lighthouse Restaurant hostess quickly showed us to our table by the window. After spending the obligatory few minutes taking in the view we studied a well formulated menu offering both set menus and al la carte dining. We chose a 4 course degustation menu which besides being very enticing was also very good value. The wine we chose suited the meal perfectly, however as in most restaurants in Singapore the mark-ups on wine are hard to justify. The food was exceptional with the trio of seafood starter one of the highlights. Finely flavoured pasta dishes followed with truffles highlighting the tortelli burrata and lobster the angel hair pasta. The lamb and chicken main courses were both flavoursome with the meat succulent and tender. The cassata dessert was a perfect finish to a memorable meal. The staff were very professional throughout the evening. The dining room seats about 40 and with good spacing between tables it is a great environment for an intimate and uplifting meal
5
Good ambiance with very good service. We had a great evening on our 18th Wedding Anniversary there. Highly recommend .
5
And it started bad I can tell...the staff managed to salvage the evening...and we ended up having one of those magical evenings ...excellent food all along ..awesome gnocchi truffles , the cod was perfectly cooked , surprising smoked egg plant puree, fantastic strawberry compote with fresh cream ...the “house” white wine was very acceptable , spectacular view obviously and very discrete and professional service ...highly recommended
5
We had some drinks in the rooftop bar. Good drinks, good service and and excellent view over looking the bay area.
5
Excellent place for celebration for birthday and anniversary. Not the first time visiting this place and definitely come back again.
5
An original lighthouse, since converted to a restaurant at the mouth of Singapore river. Stunning view and quiet place, allowing for a great way to connect between 2 business groups...
5
The view from roof top restaurant was very nice! and relaxed and cozy atmosphere. Food was so delicious. I will reserve again.
5
Loved this little intimate and exclusive feel bar. Staff made us feel very welcome and very looked after. Perfect view of the sky show at Marina Bay at 8pm.
5
I celebrated a special birthday starting with drinks on the rooftop then down the one flight of stairs for dinner. We had a fabulous night. The food was beautiful, the service was so attentive and the whole experience was just as I had dreamed for my birthday. The view was great and a bonus was seeing the light show at Marina Bay opposite. I also had the best cup of tea TWG and I managed to find the shop in Singapore to purchase some. Thank you to everyone at The Lighthouse for making my night so memorable
5
We went there when we were on Singapore for our honeymoon and it was amazing! The food was delicious, the staff was super attentive, they took a picture of us and gave it as a present with a teddy bear which we thought was super thoughtful. They have a great wine selection and the best view of the bay! Its a must!
3
We went to the rooftop bar for a drink at the end of the evening. It is "only" 10 floors up but gives you a good 360 degree view of Marina Bay Sands and the the financial district. It is a small and rather understated bar, nothing like the bar at MBS. The cocktail menu was quite limited and not very exciting and prices are comparable with other places. The nuts served with the drinks were generous
2
I visited with family and we ordered the popular set lunch. When I saw the folk on the table, I just felt that it wasn’t cleaned properly. I am not an expert of metal and cannot tell whether it is made by silver. If so, that might be the excuse. But I still cannot eat with clearly dark marks on my fork. To clarify, I am not a picky person and I am not the only one who asks for new set of cutlery. For Italian restaurant at similar prices, the food quality of Lighthouse is not at the par. I can buy the steak and pasta at 2/3 of the price at other restaurants.Someone said the view is great. I would say it is good but definitely NOT great. Fullerton by the Bay or One Altitude has the similar prices but much better view. To be honest, I am really not sure what I am paying for. I won’t visit here again unless someone else pays the bill
4
After searching for a nice restaurant with an amazing view, me and my wife made up our mind to spend our wedding anniversary at the Lighthouse restaurant. Arriving earlier than the schedule time we troll around the Fullerton hotel, feeling the grandeur and luxury of this amazing place.Making our way to the restaurant we were greeted and was shown to our table, Unfortunately that day we could not have a table closer to the window to have a better view as all of them were pre booked.Service was excellent,the waiters and hostess were very knowledgeable, presenting us with our meal with a smile.The food was nicely presented ,great balance in flavors, and good choice of products.The highlight of our dinner would be when they brought a cake for us to celebrate our anniversary.We would like to thank the F&B team for going the extra mile to make this moment special. As Hospitality professionals also me and my wife acknowledge the extra effort and high level of service of this establishment.I would definitely recommend this place for a romantic night out or for any special occasion.We'll be back again
5
Had a dinner degustation four course meal. The standard and quality of the food was amazing. Service was professional as well.
1
We loved the Fullerton Hotel but this restaurant was awful. Over pretentious, over priced, poor service, tiny portions and only a very few tables actually have a view. Don't go.
3
My wife has been wanting to go to this restaurant for some time and we booked for her birthday.We started with a drink at the rooftop bar. The views are spectacular and we arrived in time for the last moments of the sunset. You get an excellent view of Marina Bay Sands and much of the rest of Singapore. Service was good. We enjoyed our drinks and the view.In the restaurant, service was excellent. I had not warned them in advance that my wife is gluten free, but they immediately adapted, I was impressed.Wine list is very narrow and the menu also not expansive. We had a modest Pinot Grigio and both chose the red snapper main. The fish was overcooked and rubbery, barely edible. And it wasn’t cheap.In addition to a small chocolate birthday cake they gave my wife a very nice gluten free alternative desert.We finished with a nice after dinner drink back in the rooftop bar, very nice.Everything about this was first rate - except the food. It’s a pity, but would not go back
4
After meal we had a visit here for a drink. The view was magnificently amazing, u can see the MBS right across the river and the entire scene of Marina Bay is there. With my GF I had a pleasant stay though only for short time, still the service and everything was worth of money
2
Oh dear... Chef Luigi Salomone from Naples was for some strange reason given access to this stunning restaurant... in short the dishes were totally inedible... it was indeed appalling. Cabbage risotto with cinnamon - awful, powder dry rice, ZERO flavour of cabbage, overpowered by cinnamonA mushy fish dish for mains finished us off... with razor clam that was just like rubber...I cannot understand how you can serve such appalling food... even pushing the boundaries of flavours this was just too much.What a great shame that this guy was allowed to serve such awful food in such a stunning restaurant.. it was his last day... and thank goodness for that.Other than that... stunning staff / team, beautiful views and normally a brilliant dinner. Would completely recommend assuming a house chef is cooking...The rooftop bar is stunning, again the team and ambiance just cannot be faulted
5
We spent some nights at Fullerton and one day after the light shows we decided to have a drink on the roof bar, before going sleep. The bar is not so high situated as CeLaVi or 1-Altitude, but the view over the Bay Sands and the Bay is very impressive. The staff is friendly and the atmosphere is very nice. I had a virgin sling and it was very delicious.
5
Wandering in Fullerton, we very luckily choose this restaurant.Exiting the lift, warm lights and jazzy notes welcomes you.Following world class standards, the personnel his attentive and not invasive, tables are spacious and distant from one another.First we started with burrata, followed by pasta with ragout, sirloin steak and chocolate lava-cake.Execution was perfect, products of premium quality.The view is obviously as pleasant as he whole experience.Three small comments:- plates for hot courses were not warm enough- our glasses for aperitif stayed on the table after finishing them and we had to ask for them to be removed.- ristretto coffee was far from where it should beBut this apart, we had a really privileged time and thank the team of "The Lighthouse"

My sister and her daughter were visiting from Australia and wanted to treat myself and my other half to a special dinner. My sister had heard of The Lighthouse. After looking at a couple of other restaurants, we both thought the The Lighthouse seemed the better choice. It is. And it isn't. Here's why. First, the view from the restaurant and the roof-top terrace are great. Just what a visitor to Singapore is looking for -- expansive views of the Marina Bay/downtown area right around sunset.  We had a round of pre-dinner drinks upstairs (four drinks about S$100 ++) and then dinner downstairs. The dining room is small but the tables are well spaced apart. Our host seated us and explained the menu and then suggested we have a glass of bubbles each -- which he deftly turned into a bottle (which we found out later was S$138++). We ordered one starter, a seafood medley, which my niece in particular enjoyed.Three of us had the angel-hair seafood pasta, which seemed a winner with only praise for the dish. I had the steak ($58++), which our waiter recommended, saying it was a signature dish. Sadly, I can't see why. The steak, though soft, was dry. I've had far, far better steaks elsewhere, particularly at Culina at Dempsey Hill here in Singapore.  I ordered two glasses of red, after which the waiter then tried to sell me the remainder of the bottle for a 20pct discount. Overall, the service was professional but always with that air of trying to entice us to order more things and therefore spend more money. I much prefer service that is never pushy, never with a hidden agenda but always aimed at ensuring everything is done to maximise the enjoyment of the evening and the efficiency of serving the guests.  In the end, my sister paid nearly S$700, which seemed overpriced for the amount of food and booze we had.  Bottom line, be prepared to spend lots of $$$ at The Lighthouse. Frankly, for that sort of money, there are far better venues in town
5
i had a celebration team dinner with my colleagues here. the restaurant is a at the top of one of the most iconic hotels of singapore. drinks were served on the rooftop terrace : amazing view. then we had the 5courses tasting menu. great food in a very nice ambiance. overall superb experience. not cheap but good value for the money compared to similar places in singapore
5
We booked our table around 8 pm ..when we reached the venue we were seated promptly.. we ordered a bottle of wine n a aperol spritz ..2 Of us ordered starter n main course n desserts but one of us ordered only main n desserts ..my Buratina cheese starter was very good ..what I recommend is they should give a small salad to the person who doesn’t order a starter ..I think it would be lovely gestures as her main was with our main together ..well it’s the management decision..but I don’t think it’s that difficult if someone really want to do something better ..my rissotto was nice also n the tiramisu also quite good too ..all my friends they enjoyed their food too ..over all a good dining experience..Thank you all
3
Nicely located restaurant with a great view of marina bay. The food is distinctly average given the price and reputation of this place. It is easily possible to find nicer Italian food in Singapore at a lower price.
5
A 5 star venue with exceptional dining and service along with the best views of Singapore. We were given an amazing table right at the window and a complementary chocolate mousse cake desert for my fiancees birthday was a very nice gesture. Service was impeccable from start to finish... thanks so much to Rey, Alexandra and Prakash in particular for making this a night to remember. We opted for the degustation menu... phenomenal. As a hint, try to arrive at the restaurant before 7pm if you can and watch the sunset over the Singapore skyline from the restaurant "Rooftop terrace"... breathtaking. Thanks again, we will be back
5
We booked a table for my parentâ€™s 40th wedding anniversary and I asked if we could have one with a good view. They certainly did not disappoint. From the second we arrived in the rooftop bar to the second we left the restaurant, the staff treated us to the kind of service, very rarely found in Singapore. The food was beautiful (the tenderloin is the nicest I have ever had) and the red snapper was also wonderful. The staff were kind, looking after my elderly parents with such respect and dedication. Yes the restaurant is expensive but the views are amazing, far better than many higher establishments. The service and quality of food plus the intimate atmosphere turns an expensive restaurant into a great value for money night out. It is hard to find fault, perhaps their Singapore Slings are not the best but I am really clutching at straws to just find one opportunity for improvement. We will be back.
5
This restaurant is high up in the iconic Fullerton Hotel, bookings required. The hotel has been around for many years and has been left as was on the outside ,but the interior is very tastefully done, great atmosphere from the past.The restaurant has an out door viewing/ drinks area . It use to hold a large light to show the way into Singapore Harbour.Shared carpaccio , mains risotto and spaghetti gambero rosso and nice bottle of Sicilian wine , a great meal and excellent views
5
My wife and I went to the Lighthouse Restaurant, as a treat, to celebrate the last night of our holiday before returning to Australia. What a great choice!We both chose the 4 course option and each course was something special.The service was quite good and the staff were attentive and polite.The prices were what I expected for a good class restaurant and even the cost of the wine we had was very reasonable considering that it was Singapore.Our concierge on booking for us mentioned that we were celebrating 45 years of marriage and at the end of our meal the staff presented us with a Fullerton Hotel gift along with some chocolate cake.We then went to the Rooftop Bar for a nightcap and a final look at the lights of Singapore before returning to our hotel to prepare for our early flight back to Australia the next morning
1
Dropped into the rooftop bar this evening for a "quick" cocktail and some bar food to put us on for our evening meal back at Marina Bar Sands across the bay (where we were staying for a few nights). Ordered cocktails, some truffle fries and an anti-pasti platter. Cocktails took around 20mins and food ended up taking almost an hour. The odd apology was provided but no explanation... plates were not cleared at the end and we had to approach the bar ourselves to ask for the bill. 1* service from a supposedly 5* hotel. Tip - for better service and food, don't bother with here - just go straight to MBS!
5
We had an enjoyable experience today beyond our expectations. Oleksandra and Prakash were amazing. We spoke nothing of my wife's bday but they were quick to notice and prepared a lovely cake with a nice bday card for my wife's bday. We had the set menu and every dish was yummy. The tenderloin was just right and all the components that was served with it complemented each other well. They have great attention to details which wowed us.Service here is amazing! We will return for sure. Lovely place, lovely lovely view and awesome food
5
Dear Shara & Prakash - and the team,Many thanks for the excellent service we received during our dinner and drinks party. You did a great job and our guests loved the courtesy. When I came in at 530 pm, I was a bit shocked to see the chairs one above the other and tables not arranged at the Rooftop which led to my arranging the fixtures myself. I was timely stopped by Rey and Shara who helped to get the furniture right as we required just in time before our guests started pouring in. I did realise that it had put you in an uncomfortable position to start with. We realised that we were quite early about 5:30 pm - perhaps too early for a drink. The view was breath-taking from the rooftop bar as well as from the Lighthouse.  Raffy and Ian served us well at the rooftop bar. Prakash, it was a pleasure, the way you served us. I may not be able to explain all the finer points in an email or a note. It was truly a splendid service. You made all the guests comfortable and acceded to all the requests from our end. There was nothing which you could not deliver. You met the expectations 100 percent. the cod-fish and lamb selection on the main menu along with the Cassata ice cream and chocolate lava cake was top notch. Thanks Carlo. Shaara - thanks for the overall coordination. All in all - thumbs up to your service and restaurant. Ultimately the human touch makes the entire occasion special and you managed to precisely do the same. Ten out of ten for me....food, ambience, breathtaking view and most important, super service - value for the money spent
5
We celebrated our third anniversary at the Lighthouse and it was a perfect evening. We started on the roof terrace overlooking the view of the bay with some drinks, then went inside to enjoy the tastiest meal of our holiday. The service was impeccable- we felt like the only table there. The food was cooked to perfection - highly recommend the lamb and chicken! The chocolate lava cake for desert was amazing too. When we told Prakash it was our anniversary, he bought over a cake with a candle in. He took a photo and had it printed in a card wishing us many happy returns. It was such a lovely touch and now we have a lasting memory of our wonderful evening.
5
The staff were amazingly attentive and friendly, making my Dad's birthday a memorable and extremely enjoyable night. The food was excellent and a spectacular culinary experience! I would definitely recommend The Lighthouse for a delightful night out
5
We just went up for drinks to the rooftop terrace, midweek, it was a nice relaxed place to have a few drinks, conversation and admire the view
5
Highly recommended!!! Excellent food, excellent ambience, excellent service! Kudos to Prakash and team!
5
Great view, awesome services and delicious food. Price is reasonable. Good place recommended for romantic dinner or a nice meal with your loved ones. Can't ask for more.

I was staying in the Fullerton Hotel so I decided to have dinner in their 8th floor restaurant. To start with I had the Burrata Di Andria. It came with lovely heirloom tomatoes & a minuscule drop of pesto. The cheese itself was okay, but too large and served too cold. I also had the crusted red snapper with small purÃ©ed cauliflower dots as my main course. The fish was very good.Sadly, the service here is a distraction. While they attempt a snobbish appeal, they merely come off as sycophantic and lacking in sincerity
5
We had the best meal and experience at The Lighthouse Restaurant for my graduation. The staff, food, and ambiance were superb. I still dream about the burrata. We had an excellent view of the sunset, followed by the light show across the marina. I highly recommend this to anyone. I wish we had this restaurant back home in Washington, DC
5
I was delighted with the good services rendered and of course the view was good, facing the marina bay with fireworks at the right time of the year! The rooftop was also a pleasant experience with the flexibility of bringing yr drinks up or dwn to yr table. What i liked was that i wasnt hurried through my meal. The food was gd n prices not exhorbitant
5
Had a romantic dinner for my wife's birthday and she totally enjoyed the evening with friendly services, great food and awesome view.

There are many restaurants near that area offering the magnificent view of Marina Bay, I have been to 4, including The Lighthouse. The Lighthouse is the BEST choice !It is not toooo high up that everything looks so tiny and not to farrr away that all you see is light.Most important of all, the FOOD is better than the rest.The price is about the same as another restaurant which is really high up. But, the food in the really high up restaurant was disappointing :( The service is top notch !The manager Mr Prakash and his team took care of our needs and made us feel very comfortable !They asked for our feedback for each dish.The seafood trio was so well executed ! A must have dish ! Crispy on the outside but just nicely cooked on the inside, ooohhh soooo good !The entree lobster angel hair was another to die for dish.My hubby had the wagyu beef which was good too!For main dish, lamb was ooo lala !Only the cod fish dish was a little flat, after I gave my frank opinion, apologies poured in. They offered to compensate me with another dish despite me making clear I don't expect it. They still served me an extra dessert, pistachio ice cream with cheese in it.It was surprisingly good !I had tiramisu while my husband had lava cake. The tiramisu is so light . Excellent !The team surpised me with a chocolate birthday cake.They were so kind to offer to help me pack up the cake as we were very very full after all the food. (My boys got to enjoy the rich and delicious cake the next day)We continued our part 2 at their rooftop bar which is simply lovely !Thanks The Lighthouse Restaurant and Rooftop bar for making my birthday such a memorable one

Was planning a birthday surprise for my girlfriend. They assisted me by giving an birthday cake to her, on the house. And marvellous service by the service crew, and food is quite flavourful. And top it up with the night sky view of Marina Bay and ambienc

Absolutely memorable lunch! When we made the reservation, we asked if we could have a table with a view as a special treat to my Mum who celebrated her 81st birthday during the week. They gave us the best table with views to Marina Bay, paid special attention to Mum and gave Mum (and us) one of the best birthday experiences. All the staff came to the table after our meal, bringing with them a little birthday cake and sang happy birthday to her. The look of surprise and joy on Mum's face is something I will always remember. Food, service, wine, ambience absolutely faultless. But the personal touch will be why I will return to this restaurant the next time I visit Singapore

Fantastic view of Marina Bay Sands , excellent dedicated service, good food, coffee was good as well!

The first night of our stay in the Fullerton Hotel we did eat at The Lighthouse Restaurant.We did have a menu, but a dish outside the menu could not be ordered, only if we did choose a la carte dishes. So not the dish, but the menu. The food was nice, but not very spectacular. The view is very nice, the lightshow of the Marina Sand Bay was beautiful

First of all, thank you AJ from the Concierge who helped me with my tablet how to write this review. I made a good decision to check out this much hyped about restaurant by many travel magazines I have read during the course of my travels.I love Italian cuisine and I left this restaurant with the happiest feeling in my heart and the best feeling in my stomach!I have to mention little Miss Shara who was so professional in the way she handled the little mix up (partly my fault) about the drinks etc. I am not so much of a writer but if you do visit this restaurant, I can guarantee you the team there are the best I have ever seen. Ultra trained, ultra professional and highly commendable. Everyone who left the restaurant before me said Thank You to Shara and the team! How can you go wrong with that?! The view is not so much to rave about as there are other beautiful places in the world but with the combination of fantastic Italian heavenly food and service, I will give it a 10 out of 10 anytime. Keep it up Shara & Team

My wife and I celebrated our 8th wedding anniversary at the Lighthouse recently. Thank you for the amazing experience and personal touch. We had the Degustation menu and thoroughly enjoyed every course. The angelhair lobster pasta was amazing and dessert was even better. We were very touched by the extra mile that the staff put in to celebrate our special day. We will definitely be back

We had arrived at The Fullerton Hotel for a one-night stay and wanted to make the most of the one dinner we would have in Singapore. We tend to avoid hotel restaurants in cities that are new to us, because, rightly or wrongly, we think we'll get a more authentic experience at a stand-alone restaurant. However, after walking all day exploring this wonderful city, and being impressed by the uniqueness of The Fullerton, we decided to check out the in-house restaurants.The one we chose was the Lighthouse Restaurant and we made our reservation sight-unseen. We could have taken a look first because it was only one floor above our room. Nevertheless, we were not disappointed. On the contrary, it was a small, intimate restaurant overlooking Marina Bay. But before we began our meal, we were invited to take a drink in the outdoor rooftop bar above. Although the bar service was noticeably slow, we were happy to wait, taking in the view and the atmosphere. Our drinks eventually arrived and we sat there with our Singapore Slings, mesmerized by the shimmering bay with its sparkling structures all around. We could have sat there all evening, but it was time to eat. We descended the stairs to the restaurant and were seated at the floor-to-ceiling window with the same wonderful panorama which, now viewed through the glass, seemed almost unreal.We chose the 4-course fixed price dinner menu, enjoying the light and varied flavours of the Antipasti Seafood Trio, a tasty pasta dish with prawns and a very attractive and delicious dessert of chocolate cake with orange compote and ice cream. As important as the quality of the food itself was the excellent service and the spectacular view. It all added up to a perfect way to spend our one evening in Singapore

There are many fine Italian restaurants in Singapore, The Lighthouse restaurant has to be one of them. Located on the top floor (8th floor) of The Fullerton Hotel Singapore, The view is amazing and the ambiance is stylish, and is very romantic with designed spaces in a generous mode, the beautiful bar and the dining area, perfect in all aspect. The food here is amazing, specializes in authentic Southern Italian cuisine. It feels that you are dining in a very high class Italian restaurants in Italy, It is really authentic Italian .The food prices aren't unreasonable, for Singapore of course. Dishes are very well presented and nice portions too. Staff are very professional the service is excellent and very friendly and attentive and generally faultless. A perfect night. Itâ€™s extremely worth a visit if you are a visitor or a local, for its incredible food and breath-taking view. Would highly recommend. I love it that much, I will be back very soooon
5
The ambience, view, food, drinks and service in the restaurant were excellent. Coupled with the scenic views and opportunistic fireworks display from the restaurant and rooftop bar, the Lighthouse offered an unforgettable dinner experience with their carefully crafted Italian cuisines and delightful service from their staff. As we were celebrating our wedding anniversary, the staff took initiative to surprise us with chocolate cake and even a photo to commemorate this event. A great thanks to the staff at the Lighthouse
5
Visited the Rooftop bar at The Fullerton Hotel during my stay. Friday night - great view of the promenade and watched the light and sound show at MBS- uninterrupted view! Good cocktails but a tad too expensive which is a understandable. Food tool sometime to be served but was worth the wait. Definitely worth a stop by if you are at the hotel
3
I arrived early for a birthday dinner and enjoyed a few drinks at the rooftop bar which is nicely setup and has great views.There was a quite large business group in the restaurant itself. As the dining area is relatively confined, this rather spoiled the ambiance.The menu is quite compact and very Italian. I had appetiser, main & desert. All were quite competent but nothing outstanding. My dining companions had similar impressions.Wine, as at most restaurants in Singapore, is overpriced.The service is good with a well judged balance between friendly and formal.Overall the Lighthouse is good for a special occasion but we will not be rushing back, except perhaps to the rooftop bar
5
We had our anniversary dinner here. The service was impeccable. We wanted a window seat since we were celebrating a special event but they were fully booked. However one of the staff told us he would move us as soon as possible once the other diners were done and he did! The staff also took our picture and presented a number of gifts to us. We were really surprised. The view of the restaurant was outstanding. The food was good too. Would be great if they could add more items to the menu as we don't mind spending more.
5
Tried the lunch sets. The Cappelini Aragosta is divine. The seafood broth is excellent.
Service is outstanding.
The view is priceless. (Tip: Reserved the table by the window.)
Will definitely return. Will also try the SKy Bar soon.
5
Had a very nice meal at the The Lighthouse tonight. Spectacular views, delicious food. Great hosts, P.Prakash, Ray & Shara, thank you

We had our anniversary dinner at The Lighthouse Restaurant & Rooftop Bar and enjoyed both the view and the food. From the appetizer, the mains, to the desserts, everything was very good
5
The ambience, view and service was excellent!!! I was there to celebrate 2 of my friends birthday. We had a pleasant surprise when we were served with complimentary cake and the staffs were singing birthday song for us! They even took our photo and gave a birthday with the photo as gift for my Friend! Wonderful experience!
4
I didnt expect it to be such a small resturant! But it was great as it was cozy and had a good view of the marina bay area. Love the slow cooked cod, but the warm chocolate cake could have been more molten and served with a more intense vanilla flavour icecream.
5
The food is awesome esp the cod fish and appetizer. Thumbs up for the service which provide a complimentary cake for birthday celebration
5
As the title mentioned, it was truly a remarkable and memorable evening for my new fiancee and myself on our big day. In fact, the Lighthouse team went above and beyond expectations to make it a perfect experience for my proposal to my (then) girlfriend.Preparations took place a couple of weeks before the dinner date over the Hari Raya long weekend. The manager, Prakash, gamely ran me through various ideas and set up that I can consider and was more than receptive to fit in some of my ideas into the overall plan. He also provided a direct contact with him in case I had other queries or ideas, but I decided to keep the affair a simple but meaningful one, and am importantly, the first meeting gave me such an assurance that I do not feel the need for further discussions except for the final coordination.On the actual day itself, the whole Lighthouse team was in the game and resulted in a wonderful acceptance of my proposal by my fiancee, in the balcony section with just the 2 of us and a bottle of champagne overseeing the whole Marina Bay area. After the acceptance, we were then ushered in to commence our dinner course. We got a 4-course degustation menu, and it was truly appreciated that Prakash took the effort to look into our request for something light for our stomach (my fiancee and I were recovering from a minor bout of stomach flu). So in place of the meaty stuffs (we did have some prosciutto ham for appetizers though), we went with the fish dishes and pasta. I myself am not exactly a pasta person, but the Angel Hair pasta, served with Maine Lobster pieces, was heavenly! The texture was perfect and the taste has the right balance of sweetness and savoriness. Cappellini Aragosta, if I am not wrong. The slow cooked cod fish is also a highly recommended dish as the light citrusy taste accentuates the freshness of the fish, and the texture remains soft and firm for a delightful chew. But the true surprise was towards the end when Prakash and Sandra (another staff) came up to us and presented to us a set of couple teddies and photos taken of the proposal. In addition, additional customized dessert dishes were also presented stating their congratulations to us. All these compliments from the Lighthouse team!I know that this simple review does not do justice to the perfect service and excellent food my fiancee and I experienced, but we were truly wowed by the service that went beyond and we would definitely return for a romantic meal or recommend it to our friends wanting to hold a small scale event there.The place also features an outdoor bar at the rooftop and the scenery was magnificent especially during the evening sunset. Perfect ambience there

Service was appalling even before we had started our dining experience. We had requested the earliest sitting and had arrived punctually to see the staff seated inside with no host at the entrance. Two staff sprung to their feet when they saw us whereas the Caucasian lady continued to sit there and only got up AFTER we had been shown to our table. It was only then did we realize she was staff!Crew was disorganized and had not gotten the requested table sitting ready despite my having called to confirm it just an hour prior to our arrival. This however was fixed very amiably and quickly. Food was nice but not outstanding as we had expected after having read certain rave reviews. Place was very understaffed and the crew were therefore unable to attend to all the patrons efficiently - Only saving grace is the beautiful view the restaurant affords. Other than that it needs to buck up to keep pace with all the numerous top notch restaurants in Singapore
5
We couldn't fault the attentive staff who welcomed us and showed us upstairs to the bar, and took time to chat with us and make sure we tried the free canapes. The view is also amazing - quite a unique location.Our dinner inside the restaurant itself was excellent - we chose the 4 course degustation which we thought was very good value considering the high quality of food and presentation. You can view the nightly Light Show if you are close to the window but we were too distracted by our lovely dinner and forgot to watch
5
We went back to Singapore again after years of routine visits (we had our first honeymoon at The Raffles decades ago). However this time, my Mrs was not so pleased there and we both decided to go to try something new. We asked the wonderful Hotel staff at the door as to where should we dine giving him our likes and he suggested The Lighthouse.Pleased were we to be greeted with the most professional yet sincere and helpful and a kind young lady Shara. Then we were greeted with Pracash and we were indeed taken care more than we expected. What a professional and exceptional team. This hotel has won our hearts and certainly this Hotel! We will definitely advise our friends and family to look at staying at The Fullerton on their next visits.We will be back soon again and again. Thank you once again Shara & Pracash

The place was Noisy, the food was terrible. I do not recommend the place for business lunch. I was disappointed.
4
The Lighthouse Restaurant has a mesmerising views of Singapore’s skyline and Marina Bay waterfront especially during sunset. Great place for dinner if you choose ambience over food.
5
Stayed at the hotel and had dinner here the last night. Absolutely delicious. The Angel hair lobster is very recommended!
4
A fantastic way to spend the twilight of the evening on top of the Fullerton Hotel, great views over the bay. Its a little pricey but worth the cost for the experience.
5
Spent the evening at The Lighthouse for our 6th marriage anniversary and we are glad we did. Service was fantastic and food was pretty good. We were served by Prakash and his team who displayed service excellence. We were given a nice chocolate cake, followed by a simple photo taken which was later given as a nice gift attached to a Fullerton Hotel postcard. Coffee was served with a nice surprise of chocolate and sweets. Would recommend this place for special occasion and remember to make your reservations early! :
3
This place is nice wonderful location and great view. Food was excellent with good variety and the venue as quaint. Unfortunately the service had much to be desired. There were approximately 30 patrons and only 2 servers. We waited 10 minutes just to get some bread, after we had to ask. Even though they asked we we wanted more, and we said yes, it never came. We had wine and once it was out, we had to fill our own glasses. We were on a time schedule which made it even worse. Flagging down a server was difficult even for the small room we were in. For this type of restaurant as this price point it was really disappointing.
5
Must do for a special occasion in SingaporeRecommend the degustation menu option, food was amazing, service impeccable and views to match. We had a fantastic experience. Highly recommend!!
5
If you are looking for somewhere to go for a memorable meal in Singapore, The Lighthouse at The Fullerton Hotel should be on your list. A warm greeting from Oleksandra at the front desk welcomed us to the relatively intimate yet inviting dining space - reservations are highly recommended as we saw a number of disappointed people without bookings miss out on a table. We were lucky enough to be seated at a table near the window with an impressive view across the water towards Marina Bay Sands. Equally impressive was our delicious five course meal, which was surprisingly good value as far as fine dining is concerned (note - guests of The Fullerton Hotel receive a generous discount if they charge the meal back to their room). Ray, the knowledgeable sommelier, was able to assist us with choosing a lovely bottle of wine to complement our food and we were thankful for the attentive service of our waiter, Prakash.Highly recommended
5
It was my birthday and they really take care of me directly. They even offer me a birthday cake (really good tiramisu). They have a really good customer service and are very professional. The view is perfect!!!!! Thank you I will never forget my 27th birthday. :)
3
This bar and restaurant at the top of the Fullerton Hotel, which is not particularly tall, has great views. The service for drinks before our meal was slow by Singapore standards.The food was Italian in style but not particularly memorable, service was very good. However it was very expensive, over Â£500 for 4 people including a modest bottle of wine. I know its Singapore and you are paying for the location so I am not complaining
5
Location and view is splendid, we had a window table at the front of the restaurant overlooking the Marina. The food was delicious, portion size just right, ambience spot on. The Manager Prakash was very attentive without being intrusive, offered a great wine recommendation which went perfectly with our food, kept us informed of length between courses with a nice break between each. The staff knew it was our silver wedding anniversary, not by us by Gladys, Asst Recognition Manager who passed on this information, consequently we were presented with cute teddy bears and a complimentary cake which was a nice touch. It was a great evening, all the staff at The Lighthouse were impeccable and made it extra special for us. Thank you all
5
My fiancee and I were at The Lighthouse after my proposal, prior to this, I dropped the restaurant a message that I will be having dinner with them after my proposal in the afternoon. I have also arranged flowers to be delivered to my table as well. They have done a great job at delivering their service and food to our table. I was extremely surprise at their service with such heartwarming delivery that me and my fiancee enjoyed thoroughly. A big Kudos to Prakash, Rey and Olaksander for your impeccable service and cordial conversation. You have made our trip here more than just a fancy dinner.Every great business is built on friendship, and you have just done that
4
Went there for anniversary celebration, but did not indicate. Remember to indicate if you want a small cake and soft toy bear. The rooftop bar was full, thankfully we reached early around 640pm, the view is beautiful although not high floor (8th level). The service is dedicated and food is yummy. We ordered the set meal which comes with appetisers, entree, mains, desserts and coffee or tea. If we could chose the type of tea will be perfect. Make reservation early, as they only has two tables facing the window. Laser show is under renovation, if not will be even better experience
5
My friends and I are not the atas type, but we're learning to celebrate life better and have been choosing through Michelin-star restaurants to celebrate each others' birthdays. The Lighthouse was an excellent choice. The view was amazing, our waiter was kind and extremely patient (especially while we meandered from the roof-top bar to the restaurant at our leisure), dinner was incredible (we had the 4-course meal), and the atmosphere was perfect for good conversation. All in all, it was worth the price
4
Made a reservation for window seat but was told that it's upon availability. Did not get the window seat when we reached as there were only 2 window seats. Told the staff that we wanted the window seat and we were shifted right after a couple left. Great view. Good for anniversaries and birthday celebration for couples.
5
A shout out to Ray and Pakresh for their great service, constantly providing recommendations which is greatly appreciated.The main course lamb is their best seller, really really good. A must try. Tender and tasteful. Cod fish was juicy, but I would prefer they de-bone it. Disappointing that it wasn't de-bone. Risotto was quite nice too. Enjoyed the breezy roof top bar. Good view of the marina area. Much quieter than the rooftop bar around the area.Food: 8/10Ambience: 9/10Service: 9/10Value: 8/10

We visited here for our parents 44th wedding anniversary. Total disappointment from start to finish. We went to the bar first as we arrived early and took 10 minutes to get served. When we went down to the restaurant we were given the menu and it took 40 minutes to take our order after the waiter telling us he'd be with us in a moment. The table behind who arrived after us had already finished their bread before we were even spoken to when we hadn't been given anything.We felt like the waiter just could not be bothered at all and felt as if he was looking down on us during the whole night as if he was superior to us and had a bit of an attitude.We ordered 3 tenderloins and 1 red snapper. The tenderloins were all very different sizes, ranging from small to minuscule. Sauce was poured all over one of the steaks without any warning which spoilt the meal for the one person who hates sauce on their steak. They did offer to change, but after waiting for so long for the steak to arrive in the first place we were starving and didn't want to wait any longer.When drinks were empty they weren't offered to be refilled. Had to ask twice to even pay the bill. Everything was super slow, staff didn't want to be there and felt they were better than the customers.Food was OK but nothing special and not worth the price paid at all.A special occasion that was nothing special at all. Wouldn't go back even if it were free. Extremely disappointing
5
Drinks, food & company were fab! Excellent wait staff, views of Marina Bay Sands are particularly good, cocktails well mixed. Very relaxing, romantic atmosphere!
5
Wonderful experience tonight with great food and an amazing view. The dining experience was made all the more pleasant with the ever attentive Rey seeing to our every need!
5
We celebrate our Monthsary here. The view is fantastic and the food was exceptional and delicious. rey were very professional, the way he recommends the signature dishes. very attentive and marvelous service. At the bar khalid was very entertaining.he even sang a beautiful rendition of our couple theme song and its was unforgetable dinner experience, for sure we will come back to this place
5
Very professional service and courteous attentiveness by all the staff from the front of the house to the roof top bar. Attentive service by Rey the person who took care of my table alongside with Manager Prakash who walk the talk
4
It opens daily from 1730-2300
A good and ideal place for drinking and gathering.
At night with lighting all around, you will get a panoramic view of Marina Bay.
If weather permits (no rain), it is very cooling and windy.
4
Excellent dining in The Lighthouse, on the top floor of The Fullerton Hotel.
Very nice food, very friendly people and a top view over the bay.
4
I popped in for lunch and enjoyed the excellent window view and prompt courteous service from the friendly staff. Regarding the food, one could not say it was not of a adequate quality, the bread was excellent , the main course (chicken) was somewhat average. I would not go again and recommend it for a lunch with a view
1
Period. Don't expect to get served properly if you aren't Caucasian. Don't even expect to get water topped up.
4
View was stunning, food was satisfactory and the portion was adequate. Service was really good and the staff was very friendly
5
We avoid eating "in hotel" usually unless it is at a known chef establishment. Were we glad we tired travellers decided to break the rule on arriving at the Fullerton!The Lighthouse is definitely Michelin star material in food/service quality. The views were stunning and only from the 8th floor (we dined on the 67 & 57 th floors the next two nights) as yosee all the ginormous lit towers of the marina area. The food flavours/texture combinations were fantastic. The service was exceptional but genuine. It was a mix of business/locals/tourists at the 40-50 covers. Spare time to follow dinner with an open air cocktail on the roof top bar above. The views are the same as the restaurant but you are not troubled by the glass and get the sea breakers to cool off
4
I came here for a business dinner and like the physical aspects of the place. The view is fantastic and there are two or three tables right by the window with one of the best panoramas of Marina Bay in Singapore - book one of those for a really impressive date or popping the question, or if you're a tourist and want to take in the light show. The food is good, but you wouldn't go out of your way to come here for the food. The menu however was totally uninspired, I didn't see anyhing on the menu that made me look forward to my meal, I ordered the cod (yawn), which was good, but seriously, cod in an ostesibly Italian restaurant? Not one salad option in the appetisers. Food aside, service was good, prices were acceptable and view was fantastic. If O were a tourist, I would definitely want to know about this place ... but book those great view tables early
5
The view and the food were great. Up high so we could see the surrounding areas. Had the lobster roll with fries and a delicious fruit drink that was a specialty of the restaurant
5
A lovely restaurant perched on the top of the Fullerton hotel. Rooftop bar is a great way to start the evening, then downstairs to the restaurant for dinner. Lovely menu, food beautifully prepared. Fish was perfectly cooked, full of flavour, maybe if a single comment I'd say the dishes need a little more sauce and sides... Service was first class. Certainly worth a visit and would return
5
The ambience is great. The chocolate cake is superb . The waitress/ waiter are very polite and attentive. have a great time in the restaurant
5
excellent service and food. the pricing is honestly not that bad considering the location, service and views. This is a very small, intimate restaurant without many tables. Would definitively go back. Also as a bonus we got a 30% discount as hotel guests - so make sure to ask for that if you are staying at either Fullerton
4
Lovely restaurant with a marvelous view. Very good food (a bit expensive) and a kind staff. It's possible to visit the rooftop bar after dinner to enjoy the night sky and great view
4
Four of us had complimentary birthday dinner treats from ANZ bank last night in this Michelin guide Italian restaurant. The restaurant has a great view of the night scene in Singapore's financial district and MBS, especially at the bar at roof top. The waiter (Jay) that serve us was very friendly and attentive. He is also very helpful, and allow us to change one the main courses from the original cod fish to beef (original selection was Angel hair pasta with lobsters or cod fish only). Overall, the 3 course meal was quite good.
5
The place is so classy and high end. Excellent service, very professional, well groomed and well trained and friendly attentive helpful staff. So refreshing... The ambiance in the restaurant is also exquisite, so clean and nice. The view is awesome.Food is fine dining, so portions are, well, lets just say not big. But the prices also are quite reasonable.The bar on the very top is incredible, outdoor, the most gorgeous view in singapore, good service, and no pretentiousness like other rooftop bars in Singapore.Highly highly recommend
5
On a rainy Friday, my godma and I had a delightful lunch at this lovely restaurant. The view, despite the rain was beautiful; the food delicious and the service excellent.My favourite was the prosciutto ham. The accompanying pear and matured cheese perfectly accentuated the salty taste of the ham. Godma had a fish soup to start with - which was tasty but a tad salty.Our main courses were snapper and beef - both of which we would recommend - lovely flavours and simple yet lovely plating.Both godma and I had the Tiramisu for dessert - nice light concoction that was a good finish to the meal.The staff were attentive (not overly so) and very friendly.The evening view is even better but book in advance to avoid disappointment. We had tried to walk-in on Thursday evening but only managed a quick glimpse from the roof top as both the restaurant and bar were full
5
This is a very nice comfortable place with really good qualitative kitchen. The view is fantastic! We had a family dinner there, everything was very tasty. Chef welcomes you personally and you have the opportunity to say some warm words about your impressions. Thank you, chef! We were much impressed! The stuff is friendly and professional. We were served by Oleksandra, she is really nice, tactful and professional. She helped us to choose the right menu, recommended the choice of wines, helped to reserve the right table where we really felt at ease. She helped us to feel this dinner as a special occasion. Thank you for your individual professional approach, nice atmosphere and tasty sensations
5
If you are staying at the Fullerton, this restaurant has the fell and depth of a five star experience. The wait staff is pleasant and the food was first rate without huge portions. We never felt rushed and enjoyed the more formal decor and dress code
5
Just be aware that the water is not complimentary and they will charge $13 for a 750ml of Evian water.The view is splendid and they offered complimentary cake for our anniversary
5
Visited last December for my mother birthday, I booked for dinner.The experience was very positive based on the great customer service, Rey was incredibly helpful, first giving a bay view table, then arranging the cake and candles for my mother, plus all time always attentive and making good recommendations.Regarding the food I was pleased they cooked for me the Risotto Amalfitana that was not included on the menu that night.Price is according the location in Singapore.Recommended
5
Olexsandra, Jay, Ray and the rest of staff were amazing. Been here in SG for 2.5years and its the best customer service we've ever experienced. Thank you again for making my birthday dinner a memorable one. We will def be back.
5
Excellent view. Food was great . It was a bit expensive though but the service staff were excellent . Will definitely visit for special occasions
5
Dinner experience was fantastic as the food was good and staff very attentive and helpful. Rooftop bar offered excellent view.
5
After 7 years in Singapore, I found that I had missed a gem of a placeIt's a bit more upmarket than a posh Italian, and worth the wait to get inSuperb fish soup, and split a buratta, very nice antipasto (yes, two starters)One of the iconic views in Singapore, wish I had the lobster though instead of the pork chopWell done guys, will be back agai
2
Service was terribly poor. No one attended to us when we arrived, waited for a long time till we signalled to a server in the restaurant, who then told us to continue waiting for the "right" staff to bring us in! Overall service was way below expectation for a fine dining restaurant. Food was good but prices not justifiable for the entire dining experience
4
Very good meat cooking. The service from the waiter Rey is excellent, very friendly. The recommendation for the dishes is good the potion is small so can try few more dishes even only 2 pax.
4
This fine dining Italian restaurant has amazing views of Marina Bay and has the added bonus of a rooftop bar with even better views. The key is to be there at 8.00 or 9.30 when the laser light show is on. The lamb (Agnello Al Forno Rosmarino E Aglio) and tuna (Tonno Fresco Saltato In Padella Al Salmoriglio) was very popular with our group as were the excellent sicilian wines. So plan on having drinks at 7:00 and then roll into dinner at 8:15 after the 8:00 light show. A truly Singapore classic. Naturally the prices are as high for such a five star experience
4
Business dinner here with several associates the service was top notch and the European flair to the foods was also above expectationsWould come here agai
3
We don't feel the exclusiveness as compared to the last time we were there a year ago. However, the staff were nice to get us a seat near the window upon our request although booking was full.
5
Pre booked for a Saturday evening and went into dinner having had a drink upstairs in the rooftop bar. Couldn't have had a better table and views. Not only that but the food and service were excellent. I suspect that at weekends o holidays you would be very well advised to book.
3
The Lighthouse Rooftop Bar is a nice place to have a drink. Drinks are pricey. But you need to understand that drinks in any hotel bars are not cheap. You have nice view of the Marina bay.
5
Had the Italian Antipasti Business lunch with my wife. Was pleased that they met my request for sitting next to the windows. Really nice to be dining with great clear views of the Marina Bay area to go along. The service was excellent, the smiles of the wait staff made a difference to the dining experience. The food was rather delightful, though the chef might be erring on the side of health, which is fair, meaning some may find the food a bit blend. But we were quite happy with it, except that the seabass could come with some skin with its distinctive charred taste. But food is not the only thing; service is also an important part of the equation, and the professional service rendered by the staff, together with fabulous views of the bay area helped create wonderful memories â€“ it was our anniversary - of our time there that we had captured with my mobile camera
5
When we booked we asked for one of the window tables which have just fantastic views. Could not fault the service and the food was excellent. Had the scallops followed by beef. Would go back anytime
5
We had been to this nice , cozy , well-lit comfortable restautant which was near to our business centre on one warm afternoon, excellent spread of dishes made of fish, prawn , beef n lamb, well cooked, delightful to eyes n lovely quantity, over all an excellent service - a must visit

it was decent, the staff that night was nice enough but i was extremely disappointed with the seating arrangement. reason being i wrote to the restaurant before, asking if it was possible to get the seats along the glass panels 2 weeks prior. the reviews mentioned the view would be incredible that's why i chose this restaurant. it was my companion's 50th birthday. when we arrived, they gave us a table at the other end. they explained we needed to book more than a month notice for the tables along the glass panels. all in all, the food was adequate & experience was decent
5
The thing that stood out most the moment I walked of of the lift was how I was greeted with a friendly smile. We asked for recommendation for starters, and it was really good. Food and ambiance was great too, completely at ease with an amazing view
5
Very nice location and overlooking Collyer quay with a very a nice view and roof top bar for drinksService was good and with a smile. The restaurant staff had a very pleasant attitude and went out of his way to make our experience of dinning there wonderful.
5
The staff was very helpful. I am very surprised that he pointed out to us that we might have ordered more than we can finish. I was grateful as I felt just nice when we finished our dinner. Risotto is the best so far we have tasted. Scallops were nice too
4
Perched on top of the Fullerton Hotel this restaurant has a premier view towards the Marina Bay Sands. So it is well positioned to see the laser show. Food is very good. Decor is a little pedestrian and the room os somewhat pokey. Service is good.After take another stair flight up to cocktail bar and take the night air
3
The food was very average. The cost was high for dinner. Lovely views & the staff were not over friendly either
5
I and my husband enjoyed the Italian lunch and nice view from this restaurant. Service was good and the three course lunch was delicious. Most importantly, the environment is very good.
5
I was lucky enough to pick up the deal for 4 course meal for $53I need little encouragement to come to this restaurant that has a fantastic roof TOP bar, stunning views of Marina Bay, great service ( thanks Rey) and great food.Thanks again for the memorable evenin
5
I celebrated my wifey birthday today at the lighthouse Fullerton. I am extremely in awe with their attention to detail in ensuring that we have a pleasant evening. Special mention goes to Rey who took the trouble to pass us the complimentary carpark to the rooftop after we have left. Reminds me of Napolean Hill's success principle of G.E.M. Going Extra Mile. They even gave her a birthday card with our photo. Well done and thank you
5
Visited the lighthouse bar for a pre- dinner drink as the sun was going down and absolutely loved it! The Fullarton is a beautiful hotel and a visit here is not to be missed. Great atmosphere, intimate bar, lovely drinks menu and stunning views. In a Singapore sense, prices are not excessive either.
4
My husband and I went for a date at Lighthouse last nite (on a Monday evening) and it was nearly 2/3 full. Lovely view and good competent food and good service. The only thing was the music was too soft to a point I could hardly hear anything except it formed an irritating sound in my ears. Perhaps if the music was a tad bit louder, it would have been more pleasant! I understand people don't like loud music but when music is too soft, it can also become an irritating background noise. I love Italian restaurants where they play their music audibly so the ambiance is so much more romantic. Will be back nevertheless
3
I had pre-dinner cocktails and dinner at The Lighthouse. First time there.Pre-dinner cocktails was at their rooftop bar which oversees the enter Marina Area. I enjoyed this every much and soaked in the atmosphere. I would do this again. Esp if I have foreign visitors :)Then I went down 1 level for dinner. I must say that all the portions for the 5-course set was fairly decent. The only let-down was the mains. It was small and it wasn't very italian (authentic). The soup was yummy and so was the starters.Service was good.It's a nice place, but I certainly won't pay to eat there again. :
3
Great location and very helpful staff, menu ok, particularly the pasta but portions small and dishes could be hotter when delivered. Expensive let down
4
If you are looking for something different with a great view try the Lighthouse at the top of the Fullerton Hotel. A very simple menu with some delightful dishes. Take your time and enjoy with a glass or two of wine. Make sure you book. Enjoy
4
The Lighthouse has all the good components of a restaurant - good food and drinks, nice view and professional service.The rooftop bar is also good for pre- and post-dinner drinks.We used to come here a lot before we left to live in another country. We noticed the food menu is more mainstream and portion sizes are a bit bigger.I prefer the old menu but the current one is also good - it has more main options
1
Went for lunch. They were cleaning the roof and sprayed soapy water on us repeatedly while we were eating, even after making us move tables because of the cleaning. Then, we were charged $10 for a bottle of water and another $10 for a can of Diet Coke. Below average food with a lot of attitude from service staff
5
Wonderful view. Superb food beautifully presented. Attentive staff. We booked through the Fullerton Hotel concierge. I had no idea that they knew it was my birthday. We were not asked if we wanted dessert but we were surprised with a delicious chocolate cake and without an embarrassing fuss. Thankyou so much. Fine dining but not excessively priced. Well worth it
2
We had dinner in this place during our first night in Singapore, we stayed with friends and they brought us here. Maybe that day, was not a good day. I ordered osso buco, the plate came very well presented but what a surprise it was just a big bone with sauce, very disappointing, my husband was luckier than me. We had salad and was nothing special.We were then in the bar at the roof and the experience was better. In general please ensure the food is according to what prices are. Not sure if I'll go back to this placethanksMari
2
The Lighthouse restaurant is part of the Fullerton hotel. We visited this place with friends of us who are living in Singapore. The view is nice and the roof top bar on top of the restaurant is also nice. The restaurant itself however was not the best experience. We had the osso bucco, a salad and the risotto. The osso bucco was mainly a bone, not meat. The risotto was quite tasteless and didn't even had the parmezan cheese. Salad was just a plate with some green leaves and a sliced tomatoe. At expensive prices. Also the wine was quite expensive. We came to the conclusion that the price was not worth it. After the dinner we had a drink at the roof top bar. That was a better experience. But for the restaurant, we wouldn't recommend this place
4
Didn't eat in the restaurant but had drinks in the bar above. Great cosy atmosphere and we were lucky enough to be up there to see the light show from marina bay sands opposite. Drinks are a bit pricey but no more than this type of bar anywhere else in Singapore.
5
I went up to the light house the last day I stayed in The Fullerton and that was an mistake. I should go up there every day. The setting is beautiful with a great few towards Marina Bay. But what makes the place most memorable is the food. An Italian restaurant with an Italian chef - might sound normal but it is any thing else than normal in Asia. Had carpaccio on Rucola topped with fresh white Tartuffe. I am a spoiled guy but I have to say it was great - along I had a nice glass of Italian white wine - was ok.
5
Fantastic location ( 8th floor above the river ) , delicious italian cuisine, great service ( as for Azeerah !), reasonable prices, beautiful view on both side of the restaurant , and the fantastic terrasse on top of " the Lighthouse " for a last night cap ! Just an amazing experience. dO GO 
5
Restaurant was full when we got there, yet the staff never forgot to accompany everything they did with a sincere and warm smile. In fact, after 10 minutes, at least 2 staff were addressing us by our first names (that was how we introduced ourselves).The food was generally good, and the chef was also passionate and one can tell he takes great pride in his work, and is also motivated by happy customers as he made his rounds after the last plates were served. Greeting every table and sharing a story about his years at the restaurant, he made us feel welcome and at home.Will definitely visit again
5
My husband and I celebrated our 1st Wedding Anniversary at the lighthouse. Prior to eating here, we were told that the lighthouse wasn't that good. They were so wrong! Upon stepping in, the cozy and warm ambience, the amazing view - all hit me at once. We were given a seat right next to the window, and that was really the best seat in the house, you were facing away from the other dinner guests, and you get an unobstructed view of the marina! We ordered the seafood soup to share as an appetizer, which was AMAZING. It was filled to the brim with seafood! I ordered the squid ink pasta, which was great. My husband ordered the beef pasta and he couldn't stop raving about it. The restaurant also gave us a complimentary cake as an anniversary gift. With three mains (soup was a main that was shared between the both of us as an appetizer), and a dessert, bill came up to 140 SGD, which is reasonable, cheap even, when you compare it with other similar restaurants. Will definitely go back there again. Whoever is reading this - if you want an all-rounded good dining experience, try this place! You won't regret it. Oh and you get free parking too if you show your receipt at the concierge of The Fullerton
4
My partner and I dined at The Lighthouse. There was a set menu comprising of various dishes made with white asparagus, at $108 per pax. We didn't take that, but ordered ala carte instead. We had the seafood soup, which was superb!! Yums! We also had antipasti, which was rather decent. Finally we had a white asparagus dish which was alright - so we made the right decision NOT to get the set menu after all haha. We both had spaghetti (Carbonara and Squid Ink). Really top notch. Overall, very good experience.
3
We weren't here for a romantic dinner. The view is certainly amazing - you look over Marina Bay from quite high up. However, the Italian food was not great. I had a much better meal at Garibaldi on Purvis St. The antipasti was okay, not great. Had a caprese tomato/ buffalo mozzarella dish (but with no basil!), some under seasoned calamari, and some proscuitto, which was nice, but there was nothing special about it. For mains I had the rack of lamb, which was nicely cooked, but the other components on the plate (potatoes, a roasted tomato) were poorly done. My partner had chilli spaghetti which again was nothing special.The staff hovered around us all dinner, until we wanted the bill, at which point it was hard to get their attention. Go figure!I wouldn't go back, but the view was lovely
4
Our first wedding anniversary spent having dinner at The Lighthouse. Had drink on the roof top bar first, a lovely warm evening, where staff were very attentive and happy to take photos etc. Dinner was equally good, we were not at all rushed and staff attentive, but not too much. Food excellent and will be back again no doubt
5
I wonder why it took me so long for find this place. After all, the Fullerton is only next to where I work and I've been there dozens of times. So it was a pleasant surprise to be invited by a business associate for lunch last week. The restaurant had a nice view overlooking the bay towards MBS. It was small and not exactly the most decorated of restaurants. A buffet starter greeted each other of the set lunch which was $39 for a course of two and $49 for three courses. Great spread of cold cuts, meats, breads and salads. I had the recommended linguine vongole with clams. Pasta was al dente and accompanied by a light but very tasty sauce which I enjoyed very much. Finished off with a cup of coffee and tiramisu, which frankly speaking I felt was one of the best I've ever had. Moist and the right amount of everything. And it was not a tiny portion either!
4
...the Bar where we have been served in a very proffessional manner. The Restaurant has a good italian menu but, as overall in Singapur, all is overpriced espacially the wine. Good service has to be mentioned and the location on the top of the Fullerton Hotel
4
Lovely atmosphere and 360 paranoia night view is amazing. Food and service are very lovely, But need Maitai on your cocktail menu ( lol just kidding )
4
We went to the terrace for some drinks and tapas, and had an amazing time. Drinks were great (of course we tried the Singapore Sling) and tapas were really tasty. The view is fantastic, if you are at the right time, you can enjoy the lights show. Service is very friendly. Very nice option
5
We were guests at the Fullerton Hotel, and had invited old friends of ours to join us for dinner in the Lighthouse Restaurant. We met in the bar on the roof of the Hotel for pre-dinner drinks, and enjoyed excellent service throughout the evening. The restaurant was full, but we did not feel that it was crowded, contrary to some of the comments in other reviews. The food was well prepared and presented, and the portions are sizeable, so it is worthwhile remembering this, and trying to manage the menu according to you appetite. We were made feel extremely welcome, and we will return - to both the Hotel and the Restaurant
4
Good food and wine but expensive. The two waitresses were under pressure and it showed. The manager needs to employ more staff to make this restaurant top class
2
We were recommended to visit the restaurant but were left disappointed with the quality of the food. The starter was exceptionally good and we thought that we were in for a treat but the remaining courses were in stark contrast. The only really good point is that from a window seat which overlooks the river there is an excellent view of the twice-nightly laser show. The service and staff were quite goo
4
There's absolutely nothing bad to say about the food in this place. Starter, main course and dessert were very good, really very good. High quality. The airco inside is so powerful that many customers were complaining about the cold. After some people complained, it improved a bit but later it went very cold again. So sad and I don't understand why they do this? Why do they assume we all want to eat in a very cold environment? It just doesn't make any sense. That being said, you can also sit outside (one floor higher) but there was haze that night, so we didn't even have drinks outside. I would go again for a special occasion as it's not particularly cheap, but certainly the food is very good. But bring a sweater because you're going to be cold.
5
I don't usually write reviews, and if I do, they are mostly about hotel rooms. I just had to get it off my chest about the service and food at The Lighthouse. It was really good. I went there as part of an Anniversary celebration with my girlfriend and it was my first ever visit, so there was some initial trepidation. We never told them that is was our Anniversary, but eagle-eyed Josephine (service staff) spotted a small card and knew straight away that it was a special occasion. Not only was she and her colleagues warm and friendly, the food was also served on time and was delicious. There were some extras that came along with the meal which I should not delve into, but rest assured, I will certainly come back for another meal. Here's a tip; if it is a special occasion, make a reservation for a table before 8pm and do try out the roof top bar afterwards
3
Lighthouses warn ships not to come too close. Perhaps I should have heeded this warning. It's been 10 years since I was here and my memory is hazy. This time, I remember, and I'm not impressedReaching the 8th floor of the hotel, the sign is not clear as to how to get to the restaurant. it's actually up 2 more flights of stairs. there's also a lift, but not obviously clearUpon reaching, I was disappointed that I didn't get a window seat despite making an online booking 2 weeks prior. And the restaurant was not that full otherwise. Worse, the tables in the middle section are way too close to each other. We had to whisper when talking in case strangers were evesdropping. And the décor looked tired and 15 years old. they need to renovatewe were given an a la carte menu. After 10min, the server finally returned and I wondered if they had a set menu .Indeed they did. Good restaurants give both menus at the same timethe food was Italian and average. The starter, soup, main course and dessert all were bistro standard and rather borin
5
This is tucked away on the 8th floor of Fullerton and if you want to have dinner there, advisable to pre-book.Great food and service though not many vegetarian options 
4
Location: its located on the fullerton square inside of a fancy hotel. So you use 2 elevators to get to the hotel. The second elevator was out of service so we walked up couple of floors to get up to the restaurant. It wasnt bad. Hehe the restaurant itself is veery small but it wasnt very busy also. Id make reservation just to be safe. Food: food was good. Just good. It wasn't the best ive eaten but it was decent. I feel like that restaurants that has either great views or locations lack in other areas like the quality of their food. Ive always loved spinach in every restaurant but i didn't even take a second bite here. View: unbelievably gorgeous. They have the restaurant and the bar. The bar is on top of the rooftop and the restaurant is indoors. The restaurant is veery small and the windows arent thaat big so you'll have a better view and experience from the bar.  Service: very good. Attentive and efficient. Well, it was a small restaurant and wasnt busy anyways. I loved how everyone had earpieces, it made them look like men/women in black. Conclusion: overall i had a great experience wining and dining w a view. i would definitely come back here for the bar but probably not the restaurant.
5
we only had a drink in the bar last night as we are coming back tonight to eat with a group of people. Got chatting to some people meeting up after work on a conference and they were waxing lyrical about the restaurant and it was their second visit so here goes tonightThe service for the drinks was excellent and friendly The menu looks superb for food so watch for the next review after tonight
4
It was my birthday celebration. Food was good especially the beef cappacio. Chef was sincere and came to dining area to greet customers. Waitress however did not show her passion to serve customers and make customers feel special for the dining experience.
5
It is my 2nd visit to this restaurant. The food is simply divine & flavoursome. And the great view of Singapore's CBD & the Marina Bay Sands area make the dining experience really unforgettable. As guests, we can enjoy some drinks at the rooftop bar before & after dinner.
3
Had dinner with friends and were disappointed as we had heard good things about this restaurant .The waiter got our order wrong and missed out two side dishes that we had ordered ( in the end we were quite pleased as it was very expensive ).The food was just average, nothing to write home about.The only high light was the view from the top floor, even the coffee served there was far too strong and couldn't be drunk. So not good for us at all. We wouldn't return even if we had money to burn
5
We had the new luncheon menu offering a two or three course meal at a set price. The food and wine were wonderful and the staff friendly and efficient they brought out a birthday cake for my husband once they learnt of his birthday
5
Had my son's 21st birthday celebration there. Good food. Nice ambience and a good beautiful night view of Marina bay. Ms Josephine was attentive and ensured we have a good celebration with food recommendations and a surprise birthday cake firmly son. Thanks. We really enjoyed and would not hesitate to recommend our friends.
5
Came for a late night cocktail to see the laser & light show from the Marina Bay hotel (special 11pm show as well on a Saturday, just 8 and 9pm rest of week).Absolutely fantastic thing to do after the hot walk across the bridge to see the Lion fountain. The rooftop bar is a real oasis with awesome views, I got some tourist board ready photos u there, they were that good.It felt really touristy having a Singapore Sling - I've read not to bother having one at Raffles BUT I'm REALLY glad I had one here, superb taste. My partners Pina Colada was pretty good too.The Fullerton Hotel lobby is a great place to walk through too. Definitely DEFINATELY visit for at least drinks
5
One of the best views in Singapore and. The food and the wines were delicious. I have gluten intolerance and that was not a problem. They also had gluten free bread! Really nice atmosphere
5
Chef Carlo's spread for Valentines Day was simply amazing - from start to finish!! The salad was dressed in a secret herb recipe and just a hint of a citrus fruit, which I was left guessing through the dinner!! Mixed veg main course was again mind-blowing - fell in love with sautéed asparagus (yes green veggie!!) The Cruchy Gunaja chocolate cake just topped the perfect evening! The Valentines picture card was a nice touch guys!
4
We didn't eat but went up to the Bar at the top for drinks and saw the laser show from there. Amazing views over Marina Bay!!
5
You need to book to eat at the Lighthouse, we were there in off season and I'd imagine it would be difficult to get in during busier months. We all had a pasta dish and they were lovely. One son had a pork chop dish speciality and it was also good. They provide a good serving of bread. We found the wine very expensive nothing under $SG 100 but we splashed out and enjoyed. We did have a pre-dinner drink before going to the restaurant. Note:- the roof top bar is upstairs by staircase and it is good to go pre-dusk we were there from around 7.30 till around 8pm you can eat on rooftop. We then went downstairs where the restaurant is. Service very good in restaurant. Good night had by mum dad and two boys 17 & 19 just a bit pricey but we had such a short time in Singapore we were happy to dish out
5
amazing view from the restaurant and the open air roof top bar above the restaurant - superb food and service - good value
5
We came for drinks and dinner at sunset. Drinks at the rooftop bar was made more wonderful by the view of the Marina Sands. We moved inside and down one level for dinner where all four of us had a great meal. I had mushroom soup (delicious) and veal (also delicious). And gelato for dessert. But half way through dinner we went back to the roof for the water light show. So, basically this is dinner and a show. Expensive by some standards but worth it.
4
For sure you will have to go to The Lighthouse for the amazing view you have on the marina & MBS.Use the rooftop during sunset (best time).But please try the food!!! Italian food is at its best!Crispy seafood, gnocchi or tiramisu are really good!But you need to go there before 22/02/16, end of Marco Polo Menu, to try the signature dish "pork and prawns linguine cooked with soy sauce"! One of the best dish ever
5
Friendly service with delicious food and astonishing view. Despite the bill was on the high side but it's actually value for money
3
Visited for dinner tonight. Our table was stuck in a corner but the service by the staff, especially Irina, was exceptional. She was warm and friendly and came by constantly to check on the quality of the food etc.It's a smallish area and there are two huge glassed areas at each end of the room with great views, especially of the Marina Bay Sands at one end.The bread was excellent, especially with the oilve oil and salt. We also enjoyed the starter of grilled eggplant parmigiana, as well as the beef ragout in the Granano Paccheri done in Naples style, though we found the pasta to be a little hard (as they do it in Naples).My wife had the chicken casserole - while the taste was good, she felt the chicken tasted 'frozen'. I went with the roasted lamb, which was tender and went well with the grilled artichoke.Dessert of tiramisu was okay, though not exceptional.Do check out the bar upstairs - it was drizzling when we arrived so we gave it a miss
5
We stayed 6 nights at the Fullerton and we are becoming regulars as its attention to service and standards is showing real returns. One night was at the Lighthouse, which was a high class and high quality meal. The restaurant is in the old Singapore lighthouse, and there is a rooftop bar above that. Like all of the Fullerton, the bar is a nice cozy size, but the location in Singapore is superb and the view magnificent for what is in reality a low building. One gripe I have to management is that this is the first time that we were able to eat there - the hotel has a lot of paid private functions and closes their key assets off to even guests. We can all live with some of that, but when the Post Bar and the Rooftop Bar are both closed in a full hotel, someone doing the planning really needs to sort that out. Both should not be privately booked at the same time. Over to the meal we had. Checkin had made us a priority booking, but we had to wait - thats not a negative comment as it meant a trip to the rooftop bar and that was nice - the negative is that if they could not accommodate us at the time, then a drink in compensation would not cost them much and goes a long way. Service was superb as was the meal and may wife and I were celebrating, so we weren't thinking budget! Wine is though expensive and really predicated towards Italy - I suspect an Italian manager there somewhere. We did order a bottle of Italian off the wine list, and they had it (they only had one and it took a while to dig out), but at $200 we looked at it as a real treat (and it was, to be fair). As someone who travels a lot, the wine list could do with a review and the inclusion of New Zealand, Australian, South African, Chilean, etc choices. They are set up to provide a half bottle of the house, and most of the diners we were with took that option, which I certainly put down to cost; so take a few $ of the wine prices guys and scalp us on the menu is my feedback. The room itself is small (it was a lighthouse after all), so the walls are mirrored to provide a sense of space. Its not a meal venue for a large group, but an intimate romantic meal for two is a perfect solution. I have to give it an excellent as the staff tried really hard, the food was excellent and it was a beautiful evening to remember. Would we go back to that restaurant - probably, but it would have to be a special occasion. One thing to note is that if you have a Fullerton loyalty card, each stage gives you larger discounts off food and drink. 25-35% savings actually make this restaurant much more into main stream Singapore prices - maybe they have to charge like a bull as they have limited space up there, but the loyalty system is very good and provides a regular traveler with a solution and an excuse to go again! Rooftop bar though definitely worth a Gin and Tonic
3
good food good view good atmosphere but only few of window side seating area and its just for 2 person
5
What a view - has to be the best in Singapore. Lovely setting, lovely service, sooo expensive. The restaurant is Italian and the night we were thinking of eating there it was booked for a wedding - as was most of the Hotel.
5
We ate here while staying at the Fullerton. The food was really good and the view was also good. We timed our meal so we could watch the light show over Marina Bay.
5
A more formal environment than the Town Restaurant on the ground floor. The food (Italian) was excellent, and the wine list adequate. The view at night, is worth whatever the dinner cost.
P.S. Visit XII/2013
5
Good vegetarian options, great service, great view (if you reserve in time you can get a marina view). Have a drink in the Lighthouse bar upstairs first. I have been back a few times, Love it!
4
Had a lovely lunch with stunning views. The set menu lunch was fresh and with great flavours. However the wine choices were extremely expensive with nothing under SGD100. Would be nice to have a cheaper option for lunch. Recommend
5
If you are looking for a romantic night out, lighthouse is the place. As it is located at the top floor of Fullerton hotel, maybe about 8 floor high, the view at Mbs is just Panaromic as its at eye level. We were there during the rehearsal night of the national day parade, so blessed to see the magnificent fire works
1
Poorly signposted. The maitre d' met me in the bar on the top on what was a very wet night. He didn't bother to ask whether I would like to stop and enjoy a drink and take in the view. Rather, he escorted me back down the steps and into the restaurant where he slapped a menu and a drinks list in front of me and told me he'd be back. After fifteen minutes I decided it was time to leave
4
Chose the restaurant because of its proximity to our hotel. Food was excellent and the staff were wonderful. As we sat in the restaurant the weather changed and we were caught out by a thunderstorm . We had a leisurely meal and at the end of our evening there one of the staff members walked us back to the hotel lending me an umbrella and sheltering my wife. How's that for service. The food was excellent a great choice and reasonably priced. Three courses, beer and coffee just under 126 Singapore dollars.
3
The first thing we noticed and this may be important to you is that the pictures you see of the website of the outdoor tables are just for the bar, all the dining tables are indoors. Still, there is a great view. The lighting we both felt was too bright. To begin I ordered an Old Fashioned. What I got was... well I'm not really sure but it was certainly a loose interpretation. To the credit of the staff though my waitress asked if they could make me another to which I declined and I asked could I order a glass of champagne. She brought it and informed me it would be on the house. This response would be common on the US but almost unheard of in Singapore, well done. For appetizers I ordered the prosciutto with pickled vegetables and my wife the grilled octopus. The prosciutto was good prosciutto but the pickled vegetables which I was eagerly anticipating amounted to just a few slices of pickled cucumber. I was hoping for more pickled items! But still the prosciutto was quite generous. My wife was a bit puzzled to find her appetizer was almost more stew-like. Lots of saucy stuff with tomatoes, however I really liked the octopus and found it to be cooked just right and the saucy stuff it was bathed in was delicious. For our main she ordered the tuna steak and ordered it seared while I ordered the gnocchi. The tuna was way, way overcooked which was especially surprising given that the waitress made a point to confirm how it would be cooked. The gnocchi was toothsome and delicious we both agreed. Again the staff asked if they could prepare another tuna steak cooked correctly but we didn't want to wait so we made the best of it. Finally we ordered the tiramisu. It was well executed, but nothing special to note about it
5
Great place to have a meal or even a drink. Go later in the evening so you have a great view of the laser light show from the Marina Bay Sands. Great place to view Singapore's night lights.
5
Just met up with friends for a few drinks,very expensive and a bit noisy, when trying to talk and catch up .
5
Brilliant views all around the bay-you see everything going on,including evening light show!
We ate there 2 nights running as food was great,-a small menu but just what we wanted as we didn't want a heavy evening meal-delicious truffle oil chips!
Excellent friendly service!
5
Pleasant surprise to have vegetarian food specially served from chef in a Japanese specialist restaurant. Everything can be possible if you say there and it proved to me and I called chef specially to thank him.
3
The staff were absolutely perfect, as was the wine but I found the food a mix between nice and slightly underwhelming. Still nice but just didn't knock my socks off. That being said, it's a very romantic restaurant and great for an intimate dinner, views are incredible
5
On our final night in Singapore we dined at the lighthouse restaurant on the top floor of The Fullerton hotel.This is a small restaurant but with a wonderful menu and fantastic service, Ray was incredibly helpful in adjusting the menu to accommodate my preferences and recommending a very nice and reasonably priced bottle of wine.TIP, if you are staying in the hotel mention this as the food element of the bill receives a 30% discount
3
View is very nice. We only went for drinks later in the evening to check out the view.Whilst the view didn't disappoint the service did. Apart from the drinks prices being ridiculously expensive ($24 a glass of wine) we sat for 10 minutes whilst the bar staff chatted amongst themselves before leaving. We had seen the view, and didn't buy a drink so it actually worked out better for us that the staff didn't want to serve us.
5
It was an amazing dinner and an awesome ambience. Brought my friend for a dinner and it was his birthday eve. Did call them up to do a reservation and informed that it was a surprise for my friend. They remembered my request and did surprise my friend with a slice of cake. It totally took my friend offguard and we really enjoyed our dinner. Special thanks for the waiter jay who made our night simply beautiful by checking on us time and again on how was everything. An awesome place to go for a date!!

The Lighthouse serves an gastronomic Italian food in a great ambiance with great service. As I find the food extremely good, I will write about the food. For Italian food, I love pasta and pizza and this place serves great pasta. I had the seafood squid ink pasta for my main. The squid ink pasta is different from others as they serve squid ink pasta with tomato sauce instead of normal pasta with squid ink sauce. Hence there was not much squid ink taste to it but instead it had a very thick seafood taste. The seafood soup I had beforehand was also delicious and full of seafood sweetness. It was a really great seafood meal!For dessert I had the tiramisu and even though I had not had a lot of tiramisu, I find this to be the best I ever had. This is not those tiramisu cake sold in cafes. It is serve in a cup with layers of cream and really moist cake. Overall I tried the dishes my family ordered and it was all really good. Will definitely come back here again and recommend this place

This restaurant/rooftop bar is on top of the Fullerton Hotel. We greatly enjoyed the views over the Singapore River and Marina Bay. It is not excessively high over the ground, which I prefer to the excessive hights of Marina Bay Sands. We enjoyed the cocktails and the mild breeze on the two nights we stayed in the Hotel.

I greatly enjoyed dining at the Lighthouse, for its ambience, terrific service and high quality food. They were very accomodating of gluten-free requirements, while maintaining excellent quality.
5
The view is breathtaking and very refreshing. Also the food quality is nice and high quality. The whole ambience is too good and one of the best.

Had dinner here on our first night in Singapore, as we were staying at the Fullerton Hotel.On arrival, there was no one to greet us - fireworks were starting, so staff were a little distracted. We decided to go to the rooftop for a drink and enjoy the fireworks.On second attempt, staff were attentive and very friendly. We were escorted to our table. The place is clean and has amazing views. The decor is a little drab and could do with a little bling!We chose the pre-set taster menu - and it was superb. Extremely good food, great wine and great service
5
Went for pre-dinner dinner drinks to the Lighthouse and was totally mesmerized by the panoramic view of Singapore. The kir royale was mixed to perfection and served at the right temperature.We moved down to the dining area where the ambience isn't striking at all but the food is fantastic. I enjoyed a veal shank which was so tender it just melted I the mouth. Another person on our group ordered the pork chops and was as happy with the meal as I.Expensive but worth a visit at least to the lighthouse for a drink and a breathtaking view
2
We went for a business lunch. The restaurant, once you can find it, is very light and bright but has little else to recommend it. The food was average, at best, the service uninterested. In keeping with my general experience of the Fullerton Hotel, which charges sky high prices for a mediocre experience. I really don't understand all the people who rave about the food- perhaps they are carried away by the view or the fact that it is in a 5* hotel. It's really not that great
5
I thank the cheerful and attentive waitress, Josephine, for making this a beautiful evening for me and my wife. Service was impeccable, making us feel totally at ease. Food was absolutely amazing. Pricey but worth the money. Ended the night with complimentary birthday cake, Marina Bay Sands light show and glimpses of SEA games closing ceremony fireworks! Perfect
5
We got interested in visiting the lighthouse based in judgment on Tripadvisor. The good review was confirmed. Waiter Andy did a good, attentive job. The American scallops were perfectly cooked. The fish very fresh. The dessert (orange chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream) superb and the double espresso strong. We found the Singapore sling cocktail too sweet to our taste, but that's how it is - I guess. The recommended house white wine, Sauvignon Blanc, 56 $, was not up to the quality of the food.
2
Apart from the view, everything about this experience was subpar. Food: WAY too expensive and just not great. I've had better food at my local neighborhood restaurant. Staff were ok. Not great, not warm, not knowledgeable. Just ok. Ambience was non existent. I wish I'd gone elsewhere. Totally disappointing given the hype and the price.
2
We had dinner with friends - their recommendation; so we didn't complain but we should have especially at the high price! Lovely setting, fabulous views and good staff - but the main courses!! I had the Spatan "signature" dish and my wife had the lamb. Both very poor quality, lamb so tough even the requested steak knife failed - and the Spartan was about the same and very strange flavour! If you go try the fish it looked edible
4
I wouldn't have thought to have Italian food in Singapore however the views could not be resisted. At the top of the Fullerton, it served as a lighthouse many years ago hence the name. The rooftop bar is a lovely spot for pre-dinner drinks with a breeze to keep it a bit cooler. The food at the Lighthouse was very good - I had the carpaccio, beef ragout pasta and cannoli for dessert. Good wine list. The service was very attentive and the ambiance was lovely. A very nice dinner out
5
we came upon this by accident thinking we were going to have a drink before moving on to somewhere else and stayed all evening. Go there yourself but be prepared to stay just like us
5
Good location at the top of The Fullerton Hotel. The restaurant overlooks the Bay.
Had an excellent dinner with Champagne aperitif and Pio Cesare Nebbiolo (specially bottled for The Fullerton) with both courses. My wife declared the dessert excellent too!
3
They had a truffles themed dinner during October 2014. I'm a truffles lover, thus it was great news to me when I saw the menu upon reaching the restaurant. The ambience was great, however I felt that we were seated too closely to the couple next to us and our table was not near to the window which overlooked the Marina Bay. Service was warm, food was good but not fantastic. You can read my blog entry for more descriptions and pictures. http://lynnechua.blogspot.com/2014/10/dining-at-lighthouse-fullerton-hotel.htm
2
You have to pre-book as this particular restaurant is quite small and attracts many wealthier clientele.The service was excellent and the restricted menu as it suggest food was cooked to order.So there were no excuses when my Rib eye steak arrived swimming in cooking oil and was partially edible due to it being very tough.The hotel staff were apologetic and offered a 30% discoun
5
Had one of the best service experience in Singapore for quite a long while. Kudos to Fullerton Hotel and the staff at Lighthouse and Rooftop Bar. I could see and feel the pride that the staff took in their work. Staff here have clearly been empowered to provide as best a customer service as they can. Knowledgable and attentive wait staff (especially Josephine and the Hotel Duty Manager) who were not afraid to offer very valuable and alternative views on our menu choices. Had very nice squid ink lobster spaghetti. Was hoping for more at the end of it. Head to the rooftop bar for some fantastic views of the Singapore skyline. Enjoy the 'selfies' and 'wefies' there. I will certainly return sometime soon. And I think it is worth at least a visit if you have yet to be here
2
We were booked in on a Saturday evening and got to the table after a few drinks on the beautiful rooftop bar. Menus to ordering took too long, wine took too long, 40 minutes from ordering to the appetizer being on the table, and another 30 minutes between appetizer and main. The lady who appeared to be in charge really couldn't have cared less and was more interested in dealing with her earpiece - another table got up to leave just after they arrived and she ran after them in the middle of taking our order. Our complaints were not dealt with except with a roll of the eyes.The guy who was working (sorry, didn't take his name) was apologetic and brought over free drinks (appreciated), and even the chef apologized for FOH service. There were 3 staff to over 20 tables. The bill wasn't extortionate which was a saving grace. Don't like to moan and I prefer to give credit where it is due, but sadly this place is beyond help.

Italian restaurant of the Fullerton Hotel. Nice ambient, stunning view, decent atmosphere. It is clear from the menu that expectations are high: nice carte, good Italian writing, excellent choice of appetizers and entrees. Actually we found the "frittura di pesce"" excellent as well as the "parmigiana di melanzane". The real problems came after: "the linguini all vongole" (the speciality of the restaurant) are almost un-eatable...Pasta definitely badly cooked, clams without any flavour and lousy souce. Too much for the "very high" price of the dish. If you add that the renowned italian chef is not there anymore and that altogether the two course dinner lasted more that 1.5 hours (too much waiting time), there are reasons for being disappointed. Average dessert.In summary, if you pretend to be one of the best italian restaurants in Singapore you must perform better..
4
We tried to get into the restaurant but it was fully booked and we were offered a table to dine more casually at the Rooftop Bar above. Best decision ever! The most stunning 360 deg view. We shared an antipasto platter for entree, which had small servings of very good burrata cheese, prosciutto, and crispy calamari. For main I had a perfect al dente squid ink pasta with garlic and chilli, while my husband had a forgettable chicken dish. A recommended half bottle of chianti was excellent. The sorbets we ordered for dessert arrived as 3 scoops of icecream, very tasty but not what we'd ordered. Prices are very expensive even by Singapore standards. But to be honest you don't come here for the food, you come for the atmosphere and the view. It's a very small space which is surprisingly not that busy. In fact for most of the night there were only about 10 people there, and never more than 20. We were not rushed and felt very special. The wait staff were attentive when needed. Overall a great, if expensive, experience.

The upstairs bar is brilliant, great service from the boys, amazing view, best cocktails and tapas.Had such a good time booked the restaurant the following saturday night 18/1/2015.It was tragic from the start.The maitre d' looked stressed and not to happy to see us?Took over Â½ hour to get water to the table, Its a smallish restaurant 50 seater , we counted over 5 staff, think it should be manageable.My husband took a few minutes to say how wonderful the cocktails were to the lady maitre d' as she was pouring our wine, (she had head sets on and a glazed look). When she finished pouring she asked us if we like the cocktails, she didn't hear a word we said.I was having the lobster and octopus carpaccio, When served it had no octopus ( they had run out) the beans on the side was so under cooked and hard as a rock, no seasoning -- it was inedible.Look the rest of the dinner was fine and the fish soup brilliant and a great wine but bad service and a dodgy dish does not make a fine restaurant. It could be great but alas not yet close. Just stick to the roof top bar
4
A wide variety of reviews below, made us initially hesitant to book here.However, we must say we really enjoyed our meal here.We shared a massive (prosciutto ) entree, and a basket of lovely mixed breads. Our main meals were a veal cutlet and a bowl of chili pasta clams. Plus 4 glasses of wine for Sin$190 incl tax.Every course was beautifully prepared and presented.The night we were there the service was impeccable . It is great to see a restaurant serve all guests their meals at the same time, professionally synchronized .After eating, we took our remaining wine upstairs to the view terrace to watch the laser light show at 9.30pm.We would definitely return 
5
Really nice! Spaghetti all'astice is very good. Real italian chef, staff is super friendly. Best view on the light show of the marina bay!
1
My wife discovered the restaurant while on the official tour of this grand old building now the Fullerton Hotel where we stayed and had no issue with the hotel as such. We booked a table as my wife was taken with the view and yes it is delightful particularly the laser show but sadly that is where the good bits end. I asked for a Campari and soda with which to begin, it was so weak I asked for some Campari to put into it and it was still awful awful. I ordered Risotto and lobster. The risotto was a bowl of undercooked rice with the seafood barely evident, I could only eat a small amount, my wife had her entree and main course I was still waiting an hour later for my lobster when I was presented with the dessert menu, it was too late and I was past caring about the main course that they forgot my mood had become as bad as the food. I had some rather forgettable dessert and was presented with a bill of nearly $400 Singapore dollars. When I was asked how was everything I told them frankly. The manager looked daggers at the wait staff who then apologised saying it was his fault and would I like the lobster now? I replied " not likely i have just had dessert." It was a lousy experience to say the least and at an outrageous price avoid this one at all costs
5
Restaurant has a classic feel with a tinge of Venetian touch. Seated near window with fantastic view of Marina Bay Sands hotel. Ordered commemorative 4 course set and wine and tasted good. Service was impeccable with 3 very attentive servers. Recommended if you are willing to splurge a bit for indulgence.

I'm sorry I didn't try the food here , my wife and I just went to the rooftop bar which I have to say was amazing . The view offers u the best views of Singapore and the marina bay sands hotel which is very iconic in Singapore , I will be shocked if u find better views anyone else . The cocktails are really nice also but expect to pay London prices which to be fair is the same all over Singapore , what I also liked about the bar was that it wasn't over crowded at all infact we was the only ones there for like 10 minutes until another couple joined us so you really do feel like a V.I.P . Well worth a visit when in Singapore highly recommend it
1
The Lighthouse has lovely views but lacks ambience. We both started with a pasta dish which were ok in flavour but I suspect mine had been pre cooked and reheated in a microwave. We then both had the lamb racks. These were dry, overcooked, totally bland and poorly presented. The wine we chose was pleasant and the staff attentive enough but a tad over inquisitive about our enjoyment of the food. I'm sure there must be far better Italian restaurants in Singapore that offer fresh food and value for money
4
Had a company event at The Lighthouse Fullerton. Had a four course meal. It's quite a cozy place and the view from the rooftop tent is breathtaking, especially during night time. Service is top notch. The main course that I've had was quite average. Had the rib-eye beef. The taste was quite bland. Everything else is fantastic. It's one of those place you would want to go only once to try. Giving it a 4 rating - definitely worth trying when visiting Singapore. As it was a company event, cost is unknown but should be on the high $$$.
4
The Lighthouse is a cozy super high end restaurant space on top of the Fullerton Hotel. I was there for two corporate events that were both very good in terms of food. great quality and exceptional freshness of ingredients. The view is great and they have an outdoor bar area on top. Access can be a bit difficult for a bigger group as there is only one little elevator. The only not so nice point was the service, but I have the feeling that this is a general market trend in Singapore these days. The new government visa regulations make it hard to find good staff for restaurants
4
I went here as part of a business trip. The restaurant catered for approx 30 people with no issue. The food was of a high quality all the way through. The dessert option was limited. But the coffee was good. All the staff were polite and eager to ensure everyone was happy. A very good business dinner experience. Also, there is the open air bar which has great views across the city in daylight and night time.

What a view from this level on the Fullerton Hotel ; especially from the bar on the upper level.. Overlooking the entire panorama of Marina Bay and at night it is a truly spectacular view.We had a five course menu and thought it was a little too much food. The starters(seafood selection) was lovely, the soup(can't remember the name but I would classify it as a minestrone varietal) was bland, the pasta plate was superb with great tastes, textures and some beef so tender it was to die for. Then came some fish which I thought was on the dry side and a fairly average tiramisu.Excellent service, lovely wines, great atmosphere but at the price paid, we were not getting excited about the food. Pity because the Fullerton itself is one of the special hotels in Singapore.Some special aspects of dining her but on balance we felt the food left us feeling it average

Booked this restaurant as I wanted to take my husband and son to a restaurant we had not tried before. It was his birthday and we had the 5 course degustation menu. My son and I do not drink alcohol. The bread was nice, the first course and second course was not bad. The third cause which was pasta was awful. The pasta was not al dente but uncooked. I cut it and you could see that only the outer layer was cooked. The fourth course, my husband chose the fish and my son and I had the lamb. The lamb was very rare but quite tasty however the potatoes was again uncooked. This is first time I've ever been to an expensive restaurant where I get uncooked food. The last course was the chocolate cake. This was very delicious. The best course of the lot. The coffee was of very poor quality and tasted very bitter. However my bill came to about SGD 200 per head so definitely not worth the money and very disappointing. To make matters worse, my son had diarrhoea and he thinks it's from the lamb. I hardly ate my lamb so I did not get bad diarrhoea just pretty rumbly tummy. The service was good and staff was very friendly and the view when you go up to the bar is superb
3
Once you figure out how to get to it, the restaurant itself is somewhat bland. Feels like they renovated a room, put some tables down and called it a restaurant.Service was good, the servers seem very competent and attentive. The view is pretty nice, but I am not sure it's worth the price tag. A big price tag ++. The food was good, but not amazing. My pasta was terrific, lots of flavor, pasta cooked perfectly. Starter was not memorable. We had the veal chop and seafood mix ... Chop was juicy and well cooked ... the seafood was bland and unmemorable.I think with a little flair, this place could draw return customers ... but as it is now, I wouldnt come back. Not even for another 18 dollar 7-up :
2
$400 two courses and a bottle of wine, which would be fine if the quality was there.Primi pastas: pomodoro and spaghetti with good sauce, though lacking depth and slightly overcooked pasta. For such a simple dish would have expected much better. Husbands ravioli was good but under seasoned. Secondi: lamb was very good, though the ragout and garlic spinach that came with it overpowered the delicate lamb, not to mention the spinach being aggressively garlicky. Husbands chicken cacciatore had olive tapenade which was far too salty, the chicken was overcooked and dry, and the tomato sauce lacked the creaminess associated with cacciatore. After the disappointment of the first two courses, we decided not to have any more food there and left. Service was lacklustre to say the least, nobody asked at any point if we liked our food. It was disjointed too, with multiple servers asking us the same questions. Chairs were too low for the tables, which were also draped in a table cloth about 4 times too big. Entrance to the kitchen from the small dining room was a large curtain with was constantly flailing which was quite annoying. View was the only redeeming factor, but there are many other places that offer a similar view with much better food and service
5
We were staying at the Fullerton Hotel so booked an evening meal in the Lighthouse, almost fully booked even mid week. You are really paying for its location and service provided rather than the quality of the food which was not as good as I hoped it would be. Prices are steep even with the 30% discount which we got on presentation of the bill (presumably as we were hotel guests). A one off experience
5
Book a table by the window and time it so the Marina Bay light show is on while you have your first drink for an elegant, unforgettable evening with breathtaking views of Singapore. Food was some of the best Itallian we have had (and we spend most holidays in Italy). Staff were friendly and pace of the meal was perfect.Clientel was a mix of romantic couples, a big family party and buisness people.The only crinkle in the evening was that we spent so much time in the restraunt that we missed out on having a drink in the roof bar above (which closed at 10:30). Would have been nice if the bar had stayed open later but we did get to sit up there soaking in the atmosphere for 20 minutes
4
We were fortunate to get a window table at this highly recommended and well rated little restaurant on the top of the Fullerton Hotel in Singapore. The menu was exclusively italian and the chef served some absolutley wonderful dishes including the well know signature antipasti dish which was wonderful. The portions were suprisingly failry large considering the nature of the restaurant. The waiter was attentive and helpful.The only downside for us - we wished someone had given the eastern european woman on the front desk some lessons in smiling and politeness
5
We went twice for dinner during our stay. Food quality was excellent and consistent as well as the service. Of course the view is unique and it is a magical place at night with the Marina Bay Sands Hotel in the background. After dinner, do go to the terrace above and embrace a 360 degrees view of Singapore: this is the perfect spot to propose...There are 3 tables by the window, two for couples and one for 4 people. Book early and request them. They also offer asset lunch at $Sing 48/pers. Overall an intimate restaurant with excellent italian dishes, perfect for couples.You can also try the Clifford restaurant across the street in the sister Hotel, The Fullerton Bay : sophisticated decoration, great western food ( Mussels, sea bass etc) and service: you are by the bay but do not have a view on Marina Bay Sands as you are on the side of that hotel
5
We had wonderful dining experience in this lovely little restaurant. The Location is at the top of historic Fullerton Hotel. We were captivated by the beautiful view of the Marina. The waitress offered us to enjoy the rooftop bar while waiting for our table. We did climb up the spiral staircase but decided to went back to restaurant because it was very windy up there.Food was fantastic. Beef Carpaccio was one the best I've ever eaten. My wife's Pasta and my steak were also great. Looks like porcini mushroom was in season, so everything in the special menu had this delicate mushroom as part of the dishes. Service was great, very prompt and pleasant and polite.Be sure to make a reservation. The restaurant only has about 12-15 tables or so, would be difficult to get a table without reservation. Tables next to the windows would be the first to be fully booked. Time your reservation right. The sun set a little late in Singapore. We made the 18.30 reservation and it was still very bright outside. For a darker sky and vibrant cityscape try 19.15-19.30
3
Pros: great view, good service and food ok. Recommend the beef carpaccio, porcini mushroom ravioli and chocolate lava cake.Cons: very expensiveWe would dine here again if we wished to view a display within the Marina Bay but if we were chasing a purely food experience we would try somewhere else
5
We were recommended this fantastic place by one of the guys at the long bar raffles, and what a recommendation!From the time we arrived at the top till we left was amazing, the food and service was fantastic and i want to say a big thank you to Jose, Jag and Jeff for making it that more special, will never forget our visit to this wondeful place. Thank you for the complimentry drink
4
A wonderful place for a celebration dinner and as my husband had to entertain work colleagues from overseas on our wedding anniversary this was a good solution. It is a little expensive but the service and atmosphere was excellent. We each had something different either from the 3 course menu or the a la carte and it was all wonderful. The view from both the restaurant and roof bar is amazing and all set in a wonderful historic building
4
Nice to sit and watch the laser lights from the Marina Bay sands opposite .Access is a bit complicated by slow small lift and spiral staircase probably unchanged from its days as a lighthouse.
2
The main course I ordered was terrible. I ordered a veal chop, it was over cooked and I couldn't eat it. I sent it back nd was offered a tiramisu instead!
4
We went there for my birthday dinner and the view was very good, but the view was even better! Make sure you ask for a table next to the window. Also, the staff is very nice, they even gave us a complimentary birthday cake!
4
The title is an underestimation. Based on top floor of Fullerton hotel this restaurant offers wonderful city views and an excellent menu.
5
Very small restaurant, we were fortunate to have a window view. Tables are a bit close together so not sure how comfortable i would be on a center table. Food, wine and service was excellent.
5
Hosted a group of 8 here for a business dinner. The Lighthouse catered to our varied dietary needs and ensured we were all well taken care of well through efficient service. The view from their roof bar is a perfect photo opportunity from the roof of a historic hotel. I would take my spouse for our anniversary or other significant celebration. You'll need to reserve ahead and note the the restaurant and bar both don't open until 6:30. That said, you could catch a drink, or two, at the hotel bar ahead of dinner and take in the historical ambiance. Hope you enjoy it as much a we all did
5
We attended on Wednesday night which was ladies night between certain hours. We were able to get free Vodka drinks for two hours. The view is excellent and the space is well presented with lots of lounges, chairs, tables, etc. We did not eat there, only used the bar but it would make a lovely dinner location or just drinks. I will return and consider staying at the hotel as the service was great and it the public areas beautifully presented
2
A nice bright room with a good view from one table is the best to be said about this tired place.Hugely expensive mediocre to poor food including poor pasta and ghastly ice cream added up to a bad experience.Wine was way too expensive for very humble bottles and service was of the could not care less variety.The Fullerton management could put this space to better use as a store room.Never again
1
Cigarette ash in our cocktails from other patrons on the observation deck destroyed the ambience and the view. Much more attention needs to be paid to the quality of the food which was inedible and frankly dismal. Microwaving food that has been prepared an hour beforehand is unacceptable. There is far too much emphasis on the theatre and resting on laurels and not on the basics such as fresh quality ingredients cooked with a modicum of expertise. The cost was outrageous for the quality of the food and service which was very inconsistent. Worst fine dining experience in recent memory
4
Went to The Lighthouse for a romantic birthday dinner. The view was spectacular, space intimate and those are the highlights of this restaurant. Its such a pity with such a beautiful restaurant, I felt it was just nice. Food was good. It wasn't great. Lets say for the price you pay, it wasn't memorable. After dinner we had cocktails on the roof top which was very nice.I would suggest a little bit of training for the waiters. This is not a bar. Its a lovely extention from the Lighthouse. While sitting in the lovely windy night, I became cold and asked for a cup of camomile tea. The tea did come but teabag tag was wet, it probably fell into the tea which made holding it uncomfortable. My partner must have mentioned while making the reservations that it was my birhtday. The young waitress came up with the cake and said 'whose birthday?', acknowledged when we said it was I, and plopped it on the table. A little sophistication would have done nicely
2
did anyone else have a and experience with the quality of food during the week of October 11th 2013?
5
A really enjoyable meal at The Lighthouse at Fullerton. Very attentive service and great Italian food and wine.
4
The food is excellent, but this is not a fun place but more for a business dinner. If you get the table at the window it is a truly a great experience. The wine list is good.
3
I was very enthusiastic about a trip to The Lighthouse, given a number of great reviews online. However this was initially dampened by not being able to book a table in advance - as no one would amswer the phone despite calling for over an hour and leaving a callback request with the hotels front desk. I should have guessed this would reflect the service we should expect in the restaurant itself.The rooftop bar is great, with awesome views of Marina Bay Sands and a friendly barman who serves some great cocktails. This was a nice warm up to our meal, but the experience went downhill from there.We were made to wait for a table, despite the restaurant being 1/3 empty, and the table we were given was very wobbly with no view. We then had to wait 10mins just to be given a menu and even longer for drinks, food etc. The food was good but not great, and at over $400 for 2 people for dinner with drinks (a bottle of prosecco to be fair) it is extremely overpriced. I dont think our experience was the only one as I heard at least 2 other tables complaining about the food and service respectively. What a let down for what could be a top restaurant.
5
I recently had dinner at the restaurant and was overall very happy with the experience. Great location, the food was amazing, the best seafood risotto I have ever had. The only negative was the service, it was ok but one of our waiters didn’t smile once and she just wasn’t very friendly, I expected better service in a restaurant like. Overall I recommend the restaurant and I would go back if ever in Singapore again
4
Sitting atop the Fullerton Hotel, a stone's throw from the Esplanade, I visited this restaurant last week for lunch with 12 colleagues. The decor is bright and tasteful and the service was excellent; very attentive waiting staff.I chose a cold meat platter as starter and rib-eye steak for the main course. Both were excellent.The restaurant itself is not particularly large and, therefore, most tables allow for good views toward the business district or, better still, out toward Marina Bay and the by now iconic Marina Bay Sands hotel complex.Well worth a visit
4
Ambience is great and the view spectacular esp from the bar at the rooftop.Specialty menu with white truffle to add the sparkle to many dishes like asparagus Milanese, scrambled eggs and risotto. You get to choose how much truffle to add so make sure you add just the amount you like - 10 grms of truffle costs $130
5
We who live in Singapore are rather spoilt for choice when it comes to high end dining venues and possibly a little hard to please. The Lighthouse roof top bar and restaurant is one place that never disappoints . So this time I had to put it down in words.The two elevator rides and the hike up narrow winding stairs it takes to get there (no mean feat on 4inch heels!) is so worth it !We started our evening with drinks at the beautifully lit rooftop bar with it's fabulous Tapas, cocktails and 'to die for' views of the Singapore Skyline and the Marina Bay waterfront. On this breezy, balmy Friday evening the place was alive.We then headed downstairs to it's elegant restaurant with breathtaking views and the most sublime Southern Italian Cuisine. As always the food and wine were out of this world and the service impeccable.My question is, how do they manage to create an ambience that is gracious, welcoming and exclusive but without a hint of pomposity?Dining here must surely go on everyone's 'must do while in Singapore' list
5
Celebrated our 1st wedding anniversary there and the place is great.The staff asked if we are coming for a special occasion; so I informed them accordingly.Surprise surprise!! They prepare a cake for us written happy anniversary.Lovely place, good food, price is high but it's Fullerton, you pay for what you get
5
The first time we went on a whim as it was the closest reasonable restaurant to where we were.The pre-dinner drinks in the roof-top bar were great fun with stunning views and a laser light show over the bay. The restaurant is located on the floor below. Even though we had only given a moment's notice of our arrival, the maître d juggled a few tables and we had a panoramic window seat.The food was lovely. We come from London and are spoilt for the range and quality of food when eating out (don’t believe the myths - London is one the best places to eat out!). Singapore has been a little bit of a disappointment - however with The Lighthouse we were served with a very special meal. And the suggested Italian wine was a great accompaniment.We liked it so much we came again 10 days later and my wife brought her Kiwi friend who is very “discerning”. She loved it as did we!It is expensive particularly with booze.I see comments for this place are mixed. Maybe we were lucky – but I would say great view, food and some lovely wine! So far our best meal in ‘Pore. The maître d is superb too - really classy service
5
The Lighthouse bar is a great place for a pre dinner drink or a bar snack, excellent for the Marina Bay Sands light show. Thoroughly recommended.
5
The pasta and service were wonderful. The freshest Sea Bass was prepared - my husband loved the veal. Great service
3
Celebrated my birthday at lighthouse, ambience was fabulous, view of Singapore skyline good too, setback is the quality of the food. Not up to our standard of great italian food, not as good as forlino's, as a matter of fact.
5
Liked: The food and the view if you get to sit by the glass window. The freshness of the seafood, cooked to perfection. Risotto was not over cooked. The focacia and bread sticks were flavourful though I would like to see more varieties.

Our penultimate evening in Singapore was spent at The Lighthouse atop the Fullerton Hotel.As everyone has already said the views are amazing but in every other way everything was a bit under-whelming and disappointing to be honest.Service was very business like and perhaps just lacking a little something; main course came within minutes (2 or 3) of starters being cleared - too quick. Had to ask for the bill twice. I could go on but won't.All in all would have probably been 5 out of 5 in the 70's but things have moved on somewhat.S

Great meal in wonderfull suroundings Had pre dinner drinks and watched the light show from the Marina Bay Sands. The staff were so attentive which was probably due to the fact that there were not to many diners. Food was excellent and we were not rushed. The price is on the high side but it was woprth it for the view
1
Let me begin with something positive. The view is nice, if you are lucky and not sitting in front of a wall. Now to the rest. The decor is not very inspiring or cozy. The AC makes it very cold and uncomfortable. And, although the staff tries, they are not very good at their job. Every time someone else would serve food or come over to the table asking a question someone else had just asked. However, the most important factor is the food. As an Italian I was very disappointed with the quality of the food. The cold cut platter was very unimaginative with cheap versions of good meats. Both pasta's were over-cooked and too salty. The overall lunch bill came out to +200SGD for 2 persons which is unacceptable for this quality and restaurant. I did not visit the roof top bar as it only opens at 6.00PM. However, I certainly will not return

I went to the Lighthouse for a business lunch. My business partners picked the place so I had no expectation.It is located in the rooftop of the hotel. We have to take a lift to the top floor and then take another lift to the rooftop. It is worth the trouble. The deco is like all-white but yet look very warm. The dining area is not very large but the tables are nicely spaced so it feels intimate but not cramped.The price is not cheap but they have those 'lunch specials' which is pretty good value.The food is pretty good. I really like the view.I had a chair facing away from the window. But when I turned to leave I saw that they have panaromic view of the Marina Bay and the Singapore skyline. beautiful!!Will come back again. Will also note this place to bring partner for a date

The Lighthouse does not only offer regular dining. You can also sit on the rooftop and enjoy some nice snacks (e.g., Parma ham or lamb rack).The rooftop seems to be an insider’s tip. It was a Saturday night in July, however, not all tables were taken. So it is less crowded than other places in Singapore and still visitors can have a stunning view of the Singapore Flyer, Marina Bay and Marina Bay Sands

The Lighthouse restaurant sits at the very top of The Fullerton Hotel. It is a compact place with perfect views of the bay, the MBS Hotel and surrounding area. There is also a cocktail roof top bar. We were lucky to have been dining there on a Saturday evening when the firework rehearsals for the NPD were going on. Quite perfect. The service was very attentive from the minute we arrived till we left. The menu is Italian/European. We started with carpaccio. A beautifully prepared and presented dish. The main course was unfortunately a bit of a let down compared to everything else. In summary, a romantic restaurant for special occasions. Great views and service. Expensive but fairly reflects the location and service
5
Excellent and knowledgable staff, fine food and great views. Expensive but worth the price for a special treat.
5
But don't get me wrong, the italian food is also excelent. This is a small place, so in high season you should book in advance. It's on the top of the Famous Fullerton hotel, right in front of Marina Bay. From here, you'll take the best pictures of the Sands and the whole Marina. Ask the kind staff to let you go to the rooftop

We went to this restaurant last Sunday evening and reserved the table well ahead with the remark (good view, window). After checking in at the hotel the day before we checked the reservation again and it was confirmed to us. On the day we were running late and ask to hold our table as we will be 15' min late. After arriving at the restaurant our table was not ready and initially we were supposed to be seated on a table for 2 instead of 3. We were asked to go up to the terraces and wait. After 30 min we came down again, since no one came to get us. ... And big surprise we got a table in the back for 4 ;-(.We had to ask for the bread on the table, ... We could not taste the bottle of Amarone, just opened in the back - very strange behavior for a good restaurant serving wine that way. Then he just put the decanter on the table and didn't serve us ;-( . When we confronted the waiter, he excused and said he forgot it. He mentioned that he could bring a new bottle... Which wasn't really the point, after telling him that I will ask my guests if they want to change.. He just brought a new bottle (other year), which he opened in front, but never poured it in in our glasses. We did it ourselves again. Then another waiter saw it and served across the table. The food was ok, but not more.. The fillet was too much cooked.. But we were hungry since we had to wait quite a bit.Very important, if you ever go there... The view is great... If you have a good seat.. But it is very cold, so bring a jacket.We complained to the hotel, but not feedback so far. The service at the Stratton club, same Hotel, was great, even exceptionally (see separate review to the hotel). So it was even more disappointing experience of the Lighthouse :-

Had business dinner at the Lighthouse. Restaurant is exclusively located at the 8th floor of Fullerton Hotel. You get a good view of the Marina Bay area and part of the F1 track where overtaking is possible.Service was good but the 4-course dinner was acceptable. Most people left the event and didn't wait for the dessert. I guess I was having high expectation for such highly reputed restaurant. red wine was very good. I had fish which was bit dry. Presentation of dishes was acceptable
4
We ate there some weeks ago and both of us like the place. We like that it has great views, directly overlooking the bay area with Marina Bay Sands, Esplanade and Singapore Flyer. We also love the bread! Freshly baked and with such texture too! I ordered a fish dish, which it a little bit fishy on some parts, but overall still nice
1
Singapore has many nice restaurants with great food and views. The Lighthouse on top of The Fullerton is definitely not one. The views are very nice but that's about it.The quality of the food was excellent until chef Diego left. The experience last night was truely the nail in the coffin with regards to food and service here. The staff was clueless, wandering around and did not notice anything. If you spend 250 SGD on wine they should at least pour your glass when it is obviously empty. Since nobody came to our table after opening the bottles we had to resort to self service.Food: there were four people in our group and we all at different starters and main courses. One carpaccio which was OK, one papardelle with ragout which resembled nothing like how ragout should taste. My wife ordered a salad but got a plate full of fried vegetables, soaking in oil. One dish was wrong and was sent back.The main course: tuna was horrendously bad and seemed to come out of the microwave. The seabass was very badly presented and had more skin than fish on it. The potatoes on the side were overcooked. The veal milanese was very dry and not juicy as it should be.Clearly the chef is new; has never been to Italy or has no clue how to cook. If you are looking for real Italian restaurants many other choices in Singapore to chose from.Until the chef changes and the clueless staff replaced...AVOID at all cos

I've often stayed at the Fullerton but had never been to The Lighthouse, which is on Level 8 of the hotel. The good news: the view is very impressive. However, that's about the best I can say about it. I was there on business last week with a colleague and hosting a guest. The restaurant décor is very ordinary and while there seemed to be a good number of waitstaff, the service was extraordinarily slow. In fact, when our guest asked for a tomato juice he was advised that it would take at least 10 minutes since they would have to "go downstairs" for it.We placed our order at 12:45; we eventually were served the first course but I had to excuse myself to go to another meeting at 2:15 even though my main course had not arrived.What was extraordinary was that no manager or member of the staff came to the table to explain the delay or apologize. My colleague told me that my entrée was eventually served and when it was explained to the staff that I had to leave since the meal took so long to be served, the staff said she would leave it there so that the two of them could eat it. My colleague was charged for the meal and he took this up with the hotel management who did nothing other than to say they would look into it.Unless you're prepared to be there for hours, give it a miss. The restaurant is clearly relying on the "wow" factor as its appeal - clearly not worth the trip up the two elevators

The lighthouse has the best view of Singapore, specially if you visit the restaurant in the evening. The menu is very week, for a fine dining Italian restaurant I believe the choices can be much better,however it's reasonably priced. Food was normal,nothing to complain about and nothing special to brag about. Service is good and atmosphere is great. Probably a place to visit once just to enjoy the view and setting, however in my opinion not a restaurant that you would visit frequently.
4
Superb views, particularly from the roof terrace bar. Limited covers due to space available but this just makes it more intimate, and that would be better if the acoustics were better. Excellent menu though and great friendly service. Expensive, but everything of worth is in this city

Went to The Lighthouse for a business dinner with 5 others. Overall The Lighthouse was a good experience, but you are really paying for the view, service, and exclusivity rather than the food itself.Scottish Scallops - Delicious and Fresh! This must be one of the most expensive appetizers on their menu as you only get two scallops (they do come with Sea Urchin and Black Truffle as well)Atlantic Sea Bass - Average and Bland. They claim this as one of their signature dishes but it didn't come close to wowing me, it felt more like what I would expect of an average restaurant.Chocolate Cake - High Quality, Poor Value. The dessert was very good, but for $18, it felt too expensive for what it was (a Molten Chocolate Cake). For $12 or $14, this would be perfect.Overall, the Sea Bass was what disappointed me most, given this was my main, it made a big difference. Views are excellent though and they really try to provide great service (our order was very very slow, but they seemed apologetic).Good place for a business lunch / dinner - don't expect it to be a quick meal

Had a business lunch. View was fantastic and food was alright nice but nothing special. A little pricey!!!! I would say 70 out 100.

My partner and I enjoyed our final meal in Singapore at the Lighthouse before flying home to UK. We stayed in the Fullerton City Hotel 2 floors below the lighthouse restaurant, so it was a convenient choice of venue before our transfer to the airport. The food is superb at reasonable prices, with a wide choice on the Italian menu, and we noticed the plaques in the lift showing that the Lighthouse had been proclaimed the best restaurant in Singapore in 2012. The service was excellent, and the views over Marina Bay are astounding. The Maitre-De took it upon himself to liaise with the hotel concierge to confirm when our car had arrived, and the luggage had been loaded. He even provided a complimentary tiramisu dessert for us both, to mark our final day in Singapore. We thoroughly enjoyed the evening and would return again when we next visit Singapore

Had lunch with a client here yesterday. Location is great in the rooftop annex of the Fullerton Hotel near Boat Quay and the central business district. The restaurant has its own separate lift from the top floor of the hotel which gives it an exclusive feel and a sense of arrival.Its quite an intimate restaurant and if you're fortunate to get one of the tables near the front window, you're treated to a fantastic view of Marina Bay.There was a choice of set and ala carte menus. The set menu with three courses and coffee/tea is around $$48++ and is not bad given the location and ambience of the restaurant.Service was polished and efficient albeit perhaps a tad mechanical.The food was quite well prepared and I had a great seafood salad, followed by Seabass (which was a little bland) and a refreshing fruit salad to end.All in all, I think its a good choice if you're looking for something a little more intimate and up market in the heart of the city
3
Took advantage of restaurant week to try this restaurant on the top of the Fullerton Hotel. Beautiful, sun-filled room and attentive service with a mix of veteran and newbie waitstaff. The menu was a seafood appetizer of prawn and octopus salad, main was a baked pasta dish filled with ham and cheese finished with a saffron benchmark. Dessert was lemon semifreddo. Food was so-so, pretty tasty but nothing blew us away. Dessert was probably the most disappointing course as the description was more exciting than the realised product. Not bad for $40 but probably not enticing enough for a return trip
5
The is an lovely, expensive restaurant with excellent Italian-inspired food. It's on top of the magnificent Fullerton Hotel, facing the marina at the mouth of the Singapore River. Dinner for two with two drink and entree but no appetizer or dessert was S$135; a full dinner and a bottle of wine will top S$200 but you'll savor every mouthful.. Go up to the roof to have a glass of wine and enjoy a panoramic view of the waterfront

For my birthday we booked a table in this restaurant to meet friends who stayed in Singapore as part of their cruise. We informed the service about this and they arranged the menue in a way that our friend could reach their ship w/o any problems. The service at the table was ok, at least they were mote than willing to provide the service you expect in such a restaurant. Unfortunately this is not valid for the meals. The Lighthouse is an Italian restaurant and even considering that you are in Singapore you would expect better quality in a restaurant of this (price) class. Being an ambitioned hobby cook and w/o being arrogant I need to say that I would have cooked and arranged them better. So it's far away from a real Italian standard meal and by this max. average.Again on the positive side is the phantastic view on Marina from the restaurant as from the bar which is one level higher
5
I have dined at The Lighthouse half a dozen times now and have always been very impressed. The location and view are fabulous, the food delicious and beautifully presented and the staff attentive and obliging. My last visit was with an Italian colleague and we were served by an Italian speaking waitress who was able to deliver exactly what my colleague wanted (which involved significant deviation from the al la carte / set menu). My only observation is that if you want a swift '1-2pm lunch' make sure you let them know (and they will oblige), otherwise the staff will assume that you want a long lunch - which is not unfair given the ambiance
5
A business meeting not looked forward to turned out to be a wonderful evening under the stars looking across the water to the Marine Bays Sands light and laser show! The pre-dinner drinks served at the eyrie atop the hotel was fantastic. Quite, efficient friendly service and a relaxed vibe was a good start to the evening. The move to the restaurant downstairs was not without some regrets to be leaving the fresh air and spectacular views, but again was a surprise of quite, tasteful elegance and style. The restaurant fit-out was quite old I thought, but the constant stream of tasty delights and great service more than made up for it. I would highly recommend The Lighthouse for a romantic get together, a business dinner or any significant occasion
5
I booked this restaurant as a special treat to celebrate my mother's birthday and spent a long time looking at the various reviews. We wanted something with great food, atmosphere and location. I have to say it more than lives up to its reputation and expectations.From the moment we arrived we were treated with impeccable service and just the right of attention. The food was incredible and reasonably priced. I would strongly recommend this restaurant to anyone living in or visiting Singapore. Plus the views are spectacular. We will be back
5
Went there for my 50th birthday. We were a group of 11 ranging in age from 15 to 78 and there was something on the menu for everyone. The menu is modern Italian and prices are not outrageous like some other restaurants of this caliber. The setting is beautiful at the top of the Fullerton hotel with gorgeous views. Make sure you head up to the rooftop bar for a photo op. Service is excellent.

Best risotto ever. (Chicken risotto)
It is situated on the top of the Fullerton Hotel and affords jaw dropping views of the Singapore river and the Marina Bay Sands.
Elegant, romantic and very sexy.

An expensive meal but delicious food and an enjoyable night for my husband's birthday. They even brought a cake and sang to him. I would recommend and would go again.

ReviewDate: December 26, 2012Time 730PMGuests 9Waiter: Mr. Aliston LiReservationsYou will need to send over credit card details to the restaurant’s email address (including security code at the back) before you can successfully obtain a reservation. I decided to go to the restaurant in person to do the transaction. Set meal offered was S$140/head. If you opt for ala carte, you will be charged S$50/head. The total reservation fee will later be deducted from your final bill.Only a group of 4 can obtain a table nearest to the windows that undeniably shows a spectacular view of the Marina Bay.While the maitre d’ goes down to charge you for your reservation fee, you are free to go up the viewing deck and enjoy the view.Dinner properYou will take 2 lifts to get to the restaurant. From the lobby you will get off at the 8th floor. The 2nd lift will be a much smaller one. Groups of 7 guests or more may have to take turns going up.The toilet is not on the same floor of the restaurant. One will have to take the small lift again to get to the floor with the toilet.The atmosphere was quite intimate, making it a great place for a romantic date.The menu is quite limited, 2 soup offerings, a handful of antipasti- but this is expected of a speciality restaurant.Wine selection- a satisfactory number of wines are available, however our waiter was quite unable to describe to us substantially the wine offerings available.Expect long wait for your soup and meals. We ordered the mussel and clam soup in tomato which took 40minutes before it was set on our table. The mussels and clams were cooked perfectly, and were easily separated from the shells.We ordered the ossobuco (5 out of 9 people) which took 1hour and 20 minutes to prepare. The waiter even came back to me 30 minutes later to ask me what my order was again. The risotto that came with the beef looked more like cheese and macaroni. The beef was juicy and tender which almost made the wait worth it.We ordered lobster, only to be told 1 hour later that they had ran out of stock of the crustacean and asked if we would like something else.We also tried the kingfisher fillet. Presentation wise it did not look appetizing at all, lacking variety in color. It would have tasted better with more lemon as well.Perhaps to compensate for the long wait for our food, the waiter kept on asking us if he could open the next bottle of wine (while we were still enjoying the previous one). The waiters were very keen to refill our glasses with water, which resulted in our consumption of 10 bottles of evian water which set us back S$120. The waiter offered dessert at the end of our meal. We politely declined. However he still came back after 5 minutes with the dessert menu offering us dessert. The reservation deposit and the final paymentThe long wait for food was as bad as for the long wait for the bill.We waited for an hour for our bill to arrive while most of the guests had left the restaurant. Once the bill came, we were surprised that the reservation fee was not yet deducted from the final bill. Once more we had to wait for another 30minutes for the waiter to settle the issue. He came back, however the receipt still did not show the revised final bill. The waiter seemed unsure what to do. We handed over the reservation receipt so that he can process the bill properly. In the end we simply handed over the credit card to the waiter after making him subtract the reservation free from the total bill in front of us. Our disappointment simply multiplied exponentially with such a surprising display of the inability of the staff to settle a bill. The waiter did apologize many times. He gave us each a chiffon cake for free as we left the restaurant. PROSossobuco tasted greatwonderful viewCONSlong wait for food and the bill, and the waiter will not even bother to update you how long you still have to waitneed to fax over or email your credit card details for reservation, need to pay reservation feebest for small groups onlywaiter not helpful with winesdespite limited menu, not all offerings available and staff will inform you 1 hour after making your order that a a particular offering is not availabl

The meal was delicious, everythin was really nice. Experienced and impressive wait staff was a real pleasure. The view is amazing, only downside were that the toilets were an annoying elevator ride away and a bit run down. we paid $200 per head for meals and i also felt the value was not 100% there. but was still a great meal none the less
5
Top of the Fullerton Hotel. Incredible view. Roof top area for pre dinner drinks. Menu not big, but a good choice of food. I had my birthday dinner there and I got a lovely little cake (that we were not charged for) But for a memorable night, it's a lovely experience. The wines are expensive, and the food is spendy. But did I mention how good the view was :)

The Lighthouse is one of those restaurants in Singapore that is not really on the radars. I think it should be for its outstanding view and setting, great service and very good food. This restaurant serves modern Italian food, almost northern in its presentation but flavoured with a mediterranean twist. It is not your typical robust homely Italian food and you will find that the wine-list and menu here is somewhat scaled down. However, the food taste here is clean,flavourful and looks extremely attractive on the plate. Prices are reasonable for what it offers.The atmosphere inside the restaurant is extremely cosy (around 15 tables) with a fantastic view of the marina bay area. I was lucky to get a window-side table and was afforded a view of the marina bay sand light show over dinner, which was a nice treat.For dinner, we had il Vitello (roasted prime veal tenderloin in a mustard sauce andLa rucola e le mele (Rocket, green apple, and walnut salad with ricotta cheese) The tenderloin was light, delicious, soft and tender with a nice light creamy mustard sauce. The salad was good in that the ingredients were very fresh and crispy and went well with the cheese and crunch of the walnuts but suffered from over salty capers - or at least I think it was.Our entree was really really delicious. We had the La Ricciola (Grilled kingfish fillet )and L’agnello (Black Olives and bread crusted lamb loin) The fish was extremely fresh and firm and served simply with a mediterranean vegetable medley which did not mar but complimented the flavours of the fish. The olive crusted lamb was cooked to perfection, moist and juicy with a light gravy. It came atop some divine creamy rich mashed potatoes. i particularly liked the olive crust as it gave the lamb an added dimension, simple, earthy and flavourful.For dessert, we had the chocolate fondant. The cake was moist and it was perfection indeed when the rich slightly bitter chocolate lava oozed out once it was cut into. The presentation for this was very pretty.We had our coffee and complimentary sweets up on the rooftop under the stars, which really really puts a nice final touch to the evening. It was heavenly to be able to lounge around at ease with nice cup of coffee and enjoy the beautiful panoramic view of the marina bay area and Singapore city sky light.Service here is really excellent as your every whim is attended to. I felt a little cold and asked for a shawl. It not only arrived promptly but went far beyond my expectation when the service staff asked whether I would like a cup of warm lemon water to ease my chill.If you are looking for a unique place, then this little gem of a restaurant is well worth a visit.For menu: http://www.reserveit.sg/restaurants/The-Lighthouse-at-The-Fullerton-Hotel-Singapore/menu

Wonky tables not expected at a place like this, table next to us just as bad. These are the basics. Excellent bar service, but food a disappointment and we both left hungry devouring a bowl of nuts in the Post Bar afterwards despite several courses. A few vegetables to help fill us up would have helped.Not a first visit, but will be the last
5
Fantastic location, fantastic food, fantastic service this is a must for dinner while in Singapore. Had such a good time had to go twice, the whole experience was excellent. The view a 10 especially when the laser show happens from the Marina Bay Sands. The manager of the lighthouse is a total gentleman, congratulations to him on a fine job he has done. Will definitely be going again when in Singapore
3
After reading the great reviews, we were expecting big things from The Lighthouse, but came away a bit nonchalant.We had the set dinner menu, and on paper it read very well.Unfortunately, it didn't taste nearly as good as we'd hoped. The pasta and pork component were both tasty, but the tomato martini starter and basil passionfruit mousse dessert missed the mark.This is an Italian restaurant trying too hard to be different.Positives - the views are lovely
4
Had lunch here as part of our conference package along with my colleagues. Since it was lunch time, most of the people dining are on business meeting/lunch. Everyone was wearing business attire and speaking quietly. We had a set menu and it was just okay. But the view more than made up for the average food. One can see the Marina Bay Sands, Singapore Flyer and all the buildings along the marina bay. I can imagine this place to be so romantic during sunset.The place is small. Reservation is a must
5
Beautiful setting, great food and perfect service all on the roof of The Fullerton, with panoramic views across Marina Bay and Singapore
1
Wanted to celebrate my birthday, my wife made booking. Table not available, we spend some time on the patio. Asked 3 times for menue, no one interested. So we left hungry after 45 minutes. Very disappointing.
5
real italian food, at affordable price! there are many many more restaurant that are more expensive, such as Gurther's , Saint Pierre, but this one is quite good, for the prices.
5
We dined here as a couple upon our first visit to Singapore - We decided to splash out and treat ourselves on 1 of the nights - Wow what can I say the Lighthouse at the Fullerton hotel did not let us down..I was slightly worried as my other half is a bit fussy when it comes to food but he cleaned all of his plates ;-) The food was delicious we went for the 5 course tasting menu and we were not dissapointed. The staff were very attentive and at the end of our meal they allowed us to take our wine up to the roof terrace and watch the light show opposite. I would without a shadow of a doubt recommend dining at the lighthouse and hoefully we maybe fortunate to be able to dine again here in the future
4
It was on a saturday night that my friends and I decided on this place to have dinner and drinks and it was an excellent choice. There were diners with families too though it was not noisy at all. We got to listen to music as there were speakers at several points of the restaurant, and there were love seats for those who just wanted to lay back and relax to enjoy the awesome seaview facing the Marina Bay Sands. Will definitely recommend it to anyone wanting an enjoyable and relaxing night out
5
If you're looking to celebrate a special occasion, then this place does it for you. Great views of the Marina Bay harbour coupled with good food. Service is impeccable, and the sommelier and waiter's are top-notch. If you want to share your appetiser, they'll plate it separately for you. If one out to find fault, the menu is fairly limited, but hey, one can only eat one main each visit and it'll probably take you a few visits to try most of the items. So if its a special occasion - I say give it a try - you won't be disappointed. Tip: Try the foie-gras truffles tagliolini. Its heavenly....
4
The food was excellent quality, with fabulous presentation however the portions are very small. You really need at least 3 courses to be satisfied. My husband ordered the pork cheek which was delicious but so tiny that he was still hungry even with appetiser and dessert. HOWEVER the view at night is worth it all!! The light show from the Marina Sands was great and the view from the roof is breathtaking
5
It was a fantastic fine dining experience in Singapore. This restaurant served decent Italian cuisine & located at the rooftop of Fullerton Hotel with scenic bay view. This a great place for memorable special occasion celebration. Thumb up for all aspects includes service, dining quality and foods. It was last minute reservation hence I didnâ€™t manage to book the table next to the window indoor. Nevertheless, the waiter is extremely helpful to do us favor to change the table after the previous guests left. The sitting capacity and warm interior made me feel private and intimating to dine here. Not to forget to pay a visit to the outdoor rooftop for the light and water show at 8pm or 930pm by Marina Bay Sands. The Singapore bay night view is magnificent from here. The dining price is comparatively higher but worth every penny spent
3
We booked the table outside since it was hot and humid, we requested to move inside by the window which they supported. Pleased by their Customer Service and Attention to Details.Location: Gives an unobstructed view of Singapore, especially at night.Food, the breads are good...Focassia particularly stands out. The main course was average but the portions were SMALL !!! Food and taste did not justify the cost.For us, it is a one time try
4
Visited here with some friends to celebrate a birthday. Restaurant is a small dining room really, situated on the roof of The Fullerton Hotel. We had booked an outside table but as it was raining we had to be sat inside. This meant we did not have a view that made the most of the location as we were seated well inside the dining area. Food is Italian and very tasty.Portions are small and the wine is very expensive bearing in mind it is exclusively Italian vino ! However, drinks are always expensive in Singapore in posh restaurants so no shock really. Service was slow to start but improved. Highlights were the Carpaccio of Angus Beef and the Wagyu beef which is served for two to share but was incredible. Worth a visit once but make sure you get a window seat if you want to make the most of the evening
