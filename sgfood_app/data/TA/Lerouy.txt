Christophe Lerouy's signature of bold flavors is combined with amazing presentation, often shape-shifting his ingredients. His restaurant offers interesting European white wines that pair great with the food.

Great food at not too expensive prices. Given that its a tasting menu, the price is very reasonable and the quality of the food is good.

You would imagine that the food would steal the limelight at restaurant Lerouy (even though it undoubtedly did), but this was the one true show stopper - Basile Guibert's 2009 Mas de Daumas Gassac white wine. I don't typically go for white wine when looking at the wine list because I generally prefer something heavier like red wines but this was something else. A perfectly well balanced wine that complemented Chef's Lerouy dishes really really well! Hands down one of the best wines I've tasted. I'd definitely come back to Lerouy just for this fine bottle of wine. Definitely worth all that rave!In general, the overall experience at restaurant Lerouy was a pleasant one mainly because the ambiance of the restaurant was not pretentious and intimidating, which to me is the only way to enjoy the food

Really liked the interactive nature of the cooking, serving and dining area design. Unfortunately, the actual interaction was nominal. It felt like the staffs were going through the motion of food introduction. Response to queries and comments were minimal or just a blank stare. Wine pairing should have been offered as base in deguatation.

We had lunch recently at Lerouy. Grand menu consisted of 5 courses, with some amuse bouche. Love the vibes, counter seat setting. The only small problem that we had was with the meat dish, which was too little (two thin slices of pork belly which was perfectly seared). But looking at the price of the grand menu and the choice of ingredients, we felt it was value for money. I would highly recommend this place.

Went for lunch on a New Year’s Day. Ambience were good. Open kitchen, can see our foods prepare by the chefs. Foods was a bit on the salty side but the service are top notch. Plus they don’t charge service charges. Will definitely coming back for a dinner dining experience.Thank you!
