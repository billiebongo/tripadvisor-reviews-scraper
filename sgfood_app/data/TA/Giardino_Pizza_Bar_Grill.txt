Great pizza, lovely position, we went in happy hour and had a couple of glasses of wine, represented good value
4
Ordered 2 pizza with nice thin crust. Tomato sauce overwhelmed the cheese in quattro formaggio. The meaty pizza quite good. Nice view at CHIJMES
4
Don't be fooled, the pizzas are big. We ordered 6 pizzas for 6 people but couldn't finish. In hindsight, 2 people to 1 pizza would be perfect. Excellent ambience. One for one beers during happy hour4-7pm!!
3
Seems like there is a lack of staff. The service was slow, however the staff were courteous and adhered to most of our request. If you want your condiments immediately, I’ll suggest that you help yourself to them
5
Good pizza and 2 for 1 deal with Chope reservation. Had margarita pizza and mushroom ham pizza both tasty
2
Food OK staff acting like they need a long holiday, shame as setting wonderful but service and approach to things very poor, failed to listen to drink orders correctly and only sparked up when time to pay and leave.
4
Good for chill-ing with friends, nice view with great ambience! Good was average, ordered their pizza to share.
3
Located at the chijms and easy access from city hall MRT station. Environment is great. Currently Chope running 1 for 1 Pizza promotion. The pizza is just fine. Nothing special.
4
Excellent location - Chijmes ! Avg food, little high price. Staff knows what to make - we ordered veg calzone - it was damn good with pine apple (not on menu). Good beer and snacks. Dessert is very good. Can try once !
5
We visited Giardino with our son and daughter for their final night in Singapore. The atmosphere in Chijmes is great and it is the perfect place to sit and relax in the evening warmth. The staff were very attentive and the food was very good. Pizzas were large and tasty and the home made pasta was excellent
5
Not my first time here, and still loving its food. Very good side dishes & pizza. A must visit place if u love Italian food.
3
overall average food and drinks.service could be better with the staff being clearer when they serve the food
5
Good and affordable spot for italian pizza and small bites. Suitable for friends / family gathering.
4
Waiter was very friendly &a welcoming . Had pizza & their seafood platter. Pizza was baked in a firewood oven , really really tasty! Seafood platter portion was just nice for 2, marinated well.
4
1st visit and impressed with the food. Particularly like the grilled wild mushrooms, Misti carne pizza, seafood tagliolinni
5
We visited here several occasions during F1- the staff were exceptionally friendly - great pizza - and drinks served promptly
3
We arrived at 7:00pm and only got our order (two pizzas) at 7:50pm. It didn't look like the restaurant was super busy, so don't know why it took them so long. Other than that, the pizzas were good, and the atmosphere was nice.
3
The service staff were not very attentive, one has to catch their attention for a long time before they take note. Although the pizza was good, but the toast of the bruschetta was too dry & hard, the meatballs were equally dry & hard as well. In addition, we found a insect in the Caesar's salad
5
I am not an adventurous eater - like simple foods and LOVE pizza - so always look for a good pizza place close to where I am staying. Was at the Rendezvous hotel less than 500m from CHIJMES and ended up eating here twice during a 7 night stay. Sitting outside looking at the old Convent Church sure did not feel like being in Singapore! Pizza was great, beer was cold, prices are what you would expect in Singapore for a mid-range restaurant
4
Great location but at the expense of authentic, hot off the stove, hearty Italian cuisine. I'd say the best dish ordered was the tomato spaghetti. My family and I decided on this location for a birthday celebration because we wanted a central location without worrying about parking. We really enjoyed the rib eye but unfortunately the pizza crust was a little soft and soggy by the time it got to our table. This spot would have been otherwise just perfect for great pizzas and beers on a night out
2
I think the fresh made pizza baked in the oven is the only thing you should be having here - and a beer. I also hated the awful and loud techno/hiphop music, not suitable for this place
4
It's easy access from the MRT station.
It's good location near the church.
Food menu are very reasonable price.
3
Under staffed, with only two waiters. Pizza and house wine tastes average. Seafood pasta doesn't have the rich flavours, probably tastes like plain noodles coated with tomato sauce.
4
The ambience was great, pizzas are a MUST TRY! Service was a little lacking though we had wrong orders and wrong bills and it took some sorting out.
4
Giardino's Pizza Bar and Grill aside the ex Anglican Church now used for special occasions is a wonderful place to enjoy the ambience of Chijmes Courtyard. The service and pizza are very good and make this place a Singapore surprise.
4
Food is nice and good deal for happy hour. The place is a bit hot due to outdoor setting but it is romantic.
3
Happy hr ended at 7 but friendly male waiter said first round of drinks have happy hr still. When 3rd Friend came, a sour faced female waitress said no happy hr for my Friend. Finished meal, male waiter said can get another round of happy hr. ??? And also the female waitress just waved off my request for water. Gosh she just spoiled the whole experience, idk what her deal is.
2
Food was above average while service was out of my expectation. IT was just a simple request(Ice Water) but the staff will never pass by your table. IT took 15 min to serve you the drink while all the food has been serve.I sincerely hope that they can improve on their servic
5
So glad there's a promotion now Giardino Signature Handmade Pizza & 2 glasses of Aperol Spritz at $38++ I personally prefer thin crust pizza and the pizza with dry beef is so unique, after the pizza was made and the chef just put the dried beef on top and it tasted really delicious! don't forget to try the Aperol Spritz and Singapore Sling with Blood Orange Cointreau, the service was very good too
3
We wanted to sit for a while to enjoy the Chijmes ambience and so we chose Giardinos as it seemed to be not as expensive as some of the other bars and cafes there. Our pre dinner snack of pizza and fries still wasn't cheap but they were tasty enough and we enjoyed them with some beer and wine. The service was a bit pushy but other than that we enjoyed the hour we spent there
4
Outside seating inside the garden of Chjimes very pleasant on a nice and "cool" evening. Nothing to remember here apart from the sunset over the church. Basic Italian food probably a little bit pricey for Singapore.
4
I had the Pesto pizza and Frutti di Mare pizza. I had the 1for1 promo therefore it is quite value for money. However the pizza were not as nice after it became cold after about 1hr.
5
it was a very nice evening . good food , friendly staff. There was a lot of people but the serving went very fast. We go back.
5
Delicious pizzas and salad. Very polite staff. Outdoor setting. Can be quite warm though on a hot day.
4
We were looking for easy and lively, and this is what Giardino delivers. The pizzas were large and good, the serving of fries was large, and the serving staff friendly. Given that it has a large outside seating area looking onto the beautiful stained glass windows of the Chijmes hall, it all adds up to a nice package
5
Second Night at CHIJMES and we felt like Italian so gave this place a go.Needless to say my partner had a Pizza which was good but I really lucked out with the Pappardelle, it was to die for. (Went back there for work a few months later and unfortunately the Pappardelle wasn’t on the menu that night ☹).The service was also pretty good even though they suddenly became very busy.Can’t beat the views and location either and they also have a great selection of cold beer
4
Like the feel of the surroundings for a great evening with friends. Truffle Fries, Sausages and Pizza were great. Prices were too expensive as it was not fine Italian dining. Wine prices were on the high side with all wines above $ 65 ++. Whole evening spend was $ 120 per pax.
4
Located in Chijmes which is a situated in a outdoor courtyard area with a relaxed but lively vibe. Excellent wood fire pizzas, thin crust with slight charring on crust - perfection. My favorite is Capricciosa with ham, mushroom, artichoke. Wine list is a little disappointing though
4
Been missing the Italian pizza with loads of tomato sauce (not ketchup!) & finally found a restaurant that serves such yummy pizza. The crust is lovely. Portion is big & if you are a small eater, you can share 1 pizza for 2 persons. Their salad is good & portion is big too ( but I forgot to take picture).There is no ac even if you choose to sit indoor. So can be a bit humid. Service is ok and not fantastic. Price wise, it's not cheap but considering the location at Chijmes & ambience, it's expected
4
The main attraction of this place is the view / ambience. Pizzas were good but not great. Ordered 8 pizzas (all different) and felt the best one was the Pesto. Happy hour 1 for 1 drinks made it overall value for money. If not will be pricey. Service was pretty good. Will come back
4
Promotion was good. Priced well. Large pizzas. Great staff. Nice ambience. Would visit again definitely
3
Great place to just sit and chill in the middle of the bustle outside Chijmes walls. Food wise, we just had pizzas which were alright, but we had tried better ones out there.
Will try other food on menu next time.
4
Lovely ambience. Good customer service. Nice food. Price is reasonable for the food quality. Will be back again. Recommended!
5
Found this place when we had reached that time in a holiday that you need a pizza! We were not disappointed. The staff were very nice and the pizza choice and quality excellent. Obviously there were other things on the menu
4
We went to eat pizza at Giardino with the 2 for 1 promo of Chope. You got to choose from all pizza's, mixing was allowed. 2 huge pizza's were brought to us on a wooden plate, nicely baked with fresh ingrediënts. The only thing I disliked was the fact that they did not inform you that certain pizza's are white (no tomato sauce), cause mine was, and that made it too dry for me.
5
The beef cheeks were the best part of our meal, it was soft and melty and we loved the sauce that came with it. ordered 2 pizza from chope's 1-1 promo and the seafood one was the more preferred choice as compared to the sausage pizza. would be nice if the place was air conditioned to escape the singapore heat..
4
A really great location in the grounds of Chijmes. Went for dinner. Relaxed dining in garden setting. Still can't get used to smokers at dinner. Ordered the seafood pizza which had plenty of seafood with refreshing flavours and the Insalata Mista salad. Pizza came out quickly and hot. Salad was green freshness with dressing on the side. Had the 1 for 1 cocktails which was a bonus. Service was average. Helpful when asked but didn't go out of their way to top up water, see if we wanted dessert
3
They didn't have a clue about the 1 for 1 pizza offer of.Chope. then they got the diavolo pizza with all the toppings spread on separate slices. Seriously? Who would wanna eat only.mushroom or only olives. Then they put the toppings mixed and baked the same pizza. Dry! Ordered half.pints and got served and charged for pints. Go do your math.
4
Chope is currently running a 1-for-1 pizza promotion. Of course I had to eat my fill.The waiter asked to see my Chope reservation because he claimed that only certain pizzas are valid for the 1-for-1 promotion. He seemed surprised that "the list" was not on the app. Nonetheless, they still honoured 1-for-1 deal.The wood-fired pizza we ordered were both delicious:Pesto ($28++) - Parma Ham, Rucola, Basil, Pesto, Cherry Tomato, MozzarellaCappricciosa ($28++) - Ham, Mushroom, Artichoke, Onion, Tomato, MozzarellaI preferred the latter as I am not a fan of Parma Ham (too salty for my taste), but am a huge one of Artichokes. The pizza base is on the thinner side, but not the crispy did-I-really-pay-so-much-for-so-little-dough kind that breaks off when you bite it. I enjoyed it very much.Beer on Tap: San Miguel ($16++), Hoegaarden ($18++); prices are per pint. I ordered the former, but was served beer in my favourite Hoegaarden bigcup. Looked around & there was no San Miguel glasses in sight... So I just drank it.I was later charged for a Hoegaarden, not a San Miguel. But after disputing it, I was refunded $2 in cash. Not sure if this is a common occurrence here. Also not sure why it got messed up, especially since our waiter confirmed "1 pint of San Miguel, yeah?" after he took our orders. (But we are all human & sometimes make mistakes lah.)Great ambience, good for casual dates. It was a cool evening, so sitting al fresco as the sun set was quite lovely. Accepts credit cards☀ Al fresco seats only Accepts reservations - I used Chop
4
Using CHOPE App, I could get 1+1 for Pizza and Beer.After the promo, I felt the price was reasonable, but without promo, I feel price is a bit expensive.Nevertheless, delicious Pizza and good atmosphere in Chjimes so I guess I'd visit them one more time
4
Ambience was good (al fresco seating). There were also promotions such as the happy hour till 7pm that gave better bang for your buck
5
Expensive meal but your paying for the ambience of the area. Night setting is very nice for chilling and there's happy hour from 4-7pm 1 for 1 drinks. Come with a big group for value
4
Went out with friends from Europe. Food was really good (foie gras appetizer), great ambiente and lovely staff. Unfortunately, were out of some items on the menu, but still will go back...
2
poor service. not attentive, and slow. but was quick to ask us to leave after our food was done.....
5
Service was excellent! The staffs were friendly and attentive. At one point, the staff noticed that my table was shaky and took the initiative to place something under the table. I also enjoyed the atmosphere and the food
3
The atmosphere is nice as it is located at the Chijmes open area. An interesting menu with sea food, appetizer and pizza. The happy hour one + one on drinks is an attractive but on a Saturday night, the place is rigorous on limiting the happy hour to 7pm; the surrounded restaurants were working with 9pm as the closing happy hour time.Pizza is not that special if you are looking for a tasteful one but it goes well with beer or wine.The sea food platter was lacking on real taste, it could have more lime or salt or any other seasonings, just not have only grilled nice prawns, squid, mussels. Average.
3
I had noticed the Cappricciosa ($28) and Quattro Stagioni ($26) had similar ingredients except the cheaper one does not have onions. I asked the waitress, she explained the Quattro Stagioni ingredients are placed in groups and confirmed it did not have onions. As I like onions I order the more expensive Cappricciosa. But after having one slice I found that it did not had onion flavour. I informed the waiter and he went to ask his colleague. He came back and suggested the onions should be somewhere inside the pizza. I rejected his explanation and he went to check with the chef instead. He came back and informed me that the chef had decided not to include onions in this pizza flavour anymore. If I had known I would ordered the Parma Ham Pizza ($28) instead! The staff has poor knowledge of the menu and comes up with poor excuses. The other pizza I ordered Misto Carne was really good though with generous amount of meat
3
My friend and I had dinner at Giardino - we ordered pizza, truffle fries and 1-for-1 beer Portion was good for sharing among two pax (cost ~$60ish). They played renditions of acoustic (not great singers) from the radio. I like the al fresco setting but this is 'expected' of Chijmes
5
I'm afraid I can't rate this restaurant on its meals, as we just stopped by on a very hot day in search of a cup of tea. I wasn't expecting anything special as it's never easy to get a good cuppa, but I have to say that this was excellent. It came in a pot, was very hot and tasted delicious. So if you're looking for a cuppa, this is a good place to try
4
Ordered a few selection of pizzas, thanks to the 1for1 deal with chope. All tasted good. Odd that there's no beef selection available. Also had the sangria and strawberry Margarita. The latter tasted somewhat on the mild aide, and didn't have the slurry ice blended texture that I could relate a Margarita to. A little warm outdoors. Need more fans. But all in all, strive was prompt and it was a good dining experience.
5
Totally enjoyed my dining experience at Giardino. Staff was attentive and v friendly. Beverage was reasonable pricing and the Chope promotion made it irresistible to go for a second visit.
4
The pizzas, meat balls and duck fat potatoes are really good. We will be back for more! It is also a child friendly place.
4
Good pizza. Interesting tiramisù. Only bruschetta wasn't satisfactory because Cold...tomato too cold
5
We liked the food and the service quality is excellent. The parma ham pizza is great and we really enjoyed it.
4
food is delicious. Location and atmosphere is good but the restaurant lightings can still be improved. Overall the experience is nice and definitely be back soon
5
We visited here nearly every night during our weeks stay in Singapore. Each time we were served by Matt who was amazing. Would highly recommend here to anyone visiting chijmes
4
Really good Italian Food considering we are in Singapore. Not the case of 'when in Rome..' I know.....just wanted something different from the asian main stream foods....this hit the spot.
3
My friends and I visited Giardino on New Year's Eve for dinner. We loved the ambiance and the pizza was delicious. We ordered the pasta and truffle fries to try as well - they were average. If you are wondering what to order, I would recommend getting their pizzas to try.
3
Went to have Xmas Dinner at Giardino and it was also my first time having a dinner at Chijmes. However the entire experience in the restaurant was underwhelming. Food was average and did not live up to the reviews i read online. Pasta and Pizza has room for improvement.
4
We went there for dinner and it didn't disappoint! The ambiance is relaxed and the surroundings are quite pretty at night. We ate outside and really got to enjoy the twinkling lights in the courtyard and the view of the stained glass of the Chijmes Hall. We had wine and pizza and went home very satisfied. It's a good date place and also a place to go with friends.
4
After nearly two weeks of rice twice a day I needed a pizza. Glad I came here. Simple - which was good. Not expensive (I only drank Coke though) and good quality.
4
The is restaurant is cozy and located near a church in Chjimes Singapore. The food is quite expensive. Vegans don't even need to think about dining there because there is nothing suitable on the menu. Vegetarians will have it a bit easier.
4
We wanted to try a pizza on a Friday evening with a couple of beers. The service and pizza was good at Giardino, more specifically the location of the restaurant in front of Chijmes church! It was a romantic evening that we enjoyed!
3
The Italian restaurant is located in Chimes, a nice enclosed garden in Singapore. the price for the pizzas and the quality did not really match up..Too expensive
4
Came to this restaurant for dinner and we sat outside admiring the view and listening to the music. It was quiet relaxing. They have all day happy hour, which made the cost of wine and cocktails $8 each, which was a nice change from paying $20+. The service was prompt and friendly. We ordered a pizza to share - half seafood and half meat lovers. It was so so, needs more seasoning. I would still recommend the restaurant.
4
Came with a group of 8. Service was good and ambiance was amazing. Ordered a seafood tagliolini. The seafood was fresh and I whacked it clean but the sauce was rather disappointing.However, the shortfall was compensated the moment my dessert arrived. Ordered affogato for dessert and I was extremely pleased with it. The taste of the vanilla ice cream and espresso was on point! Perfect beyond words
1
The place was almost empty on a Saturday evening. The menu was a laminated single page with poor selection of dishes. Some of the dishes were not available. Considering that they define themselves as a "Pizzeria", even a simple Pizza Margherita was pretty disappointing (compared to local standards, not to mention to the "Italian" standard for pizzas. The other dishes were just as disappointing. Definitely a non-return place for us
4
Went to this pizzeria which forms part of the Chjimes complex. Had previously eaten in a Chjimes restaurant many years ago, and been very disappointed. This time I was pleasantly surprised. Sitting outside under awnings, looking across the courtyard, it was pleasantly located. Service was quick and attentive. The pizza was authentic, from a wood fired oven, with a nice crisp base. At 26 -28 dollars for the pizza and House wine at 8sing dollars, it was not cheap but was reasonable, compared to other local restaurants in the area
5
I've visited the Giardino grill recently with a friends. We had a Pizzas and Pastas and some drinks which was recommended by the manager named Rahamat and he even took an effort to explains about the food as well as drinks to my preference choices. Yes, I must say the service by Rahamat was truly excellent and the food was great too. Highly recommended place for chill out, happy hour and dinner. Well done!! Cheers.
1
I have been in singapore for a while now but this restaurant has the most pathetic service I have ever encountered in the country. The waiters were non attentive and one of them even banged into my seat several times just so that he could take a shorter route to serve his tables. And not once did he apologize. And once when he almost knocked me off my seat he actually blamed me rather than apologizing. The waiter doesn't even bother to get fresh glasses for water and casually serves water in our beer glasses. We tried raising our issues to the manager but he needs some serious training and he absolutely does know how to deal with rightfully irate customers. One of the waiters who had no business to be at our table since he was not serving us starts mocking at us when we were raising our issues with the manager. Where on earth does this happen??? And to say these guys are in the hospitality industry! please avoid at all cost
5
After a few days in Singapore I craved for a good pizza, and I spot this place. From an Italian, belive me this is a very good pizza, cooked in a real clay oven and the ingredients are fresh. Approved!
4
The staff was very friendly. The pizza was great and the atmosphere around is great. I just found it a little bit to pricey, but I guess all the places in Chijmes are a more expensive.
4
We visited the one at Robertson Quay but I cannot find a separate listing for it. Except for the pizza the meals were quite small here for the money, but they really were absolutely fantastic. Quite possibly the best ravioli I have ever had. The staff were great and being New Year's Eve they gave the kids a little pack of celebratory items (mask etc) after dinner. Probably a good option for a grown ups dinner but not worth it for the kids
5
Lovely place to sit, relax and get away from the hustle of the streets. It has a bit of a relaxed European feel sitting outside in the shadow of the cathedral. Food was excellent. We stopped here because of the restaurant's cozy location and it's happy hour offers. Stop in, you won't be disappointed. I could see this becoming a favorite, would definitely recommend and visit again
5
we dropped by for a meal one night, we were tired and just wanted something quick easy and cheap, we had a pizza to share and some drinks the bill was reasonable, the pizza was to die for, best crust i have had in a long time and of course the san mogul went down easy., we came back the next night (new years eve) for a drink as the Manager chap was so friendly, a nice little restaurant in a nice little area
1
I went last night with my wife at Giardino, before I start this review I wanna say that I'm Italian and I work in F&b also so I'm not just nagging about the place it's a sincere review.Nice place, nice outdoor seating but that's all about it.First of all menus look like a food court menu just piece of plastic with pictures thrown here and there ... staff friendly .. but they don't have a clue of what they selling, I have asked if on the burrata pizza they would put actual burrata on top and the guy said no "they just put a little little bit" so I asked him they call it burrata pizza ... and his answer was a recommendation to buy burrata and Parma ham :( We ordered starter and mains Food came all together so by the time we finished our foie gras my wife's pasta was cold ...We have ordered spritz they came with sprite ...My burrata pizza looked decent but first bite the dough was rubbery and hard (and that doesn't depend on the wooden fired oven) but the dough was for sure 1 or 2 days old, dry and with a miserable quantity of rocket on top.My wife pasta: tagliolini with seafood in tomato sauce.We kindly asked the waiter to change the sauce to white wine sauce because she doesn't like tomato sauce and seafoodWhen the pasta arrived was aglio and olio style no sign e of any white wine sauce dry as I never seen in my life ( if one of my chefs send something like that I would be embarrassed) cold (thanks to our waiter who took the order) and no taste at all very bland. (She didn't even eat half of it) Nobody bothered to ask us how was our meal and the place was empty maybe 4 or 5 tables? When we asked for the bill the waiter picked up the pasta and never asked us anything .. The manager also (I think he was tired because he couldn't stop to lean on chairs, tables, counter ) saw the plate and as a good restaurant manager would do HE IGNORED. This is our experience at Giardino A sincere apologies to who will go and eat there.There are many other places with that range of price but way better food
5
On a very busy Friday night when the restaurant was full, the service was great. The staff were on the run the entire time we were there but managed to keep up with the food and drink orders while staying friendly and efficient. The pizzas were delicious and the salad interesting. The desserts were generous servings. The vibe here was buzzy and fun with all diners enjoying their night out at Chijmes. We were lucky to get a seat
1
If a restaurant cannot even prepare a decent pizza, forget about the rest.Horrible taste, dry, cold, no cheese, nothing. tasteless.Maybe we were on the wrong evening, sunday, and the indian staff doesn't care at all about unsatisfied customers. Pizzahut is a 100 times better for less than half the money. This place has nothing to do in Chimes
5
Staying at the Rendezvous Hotel not far from this restaurant and stumbled upon it when investigating the beautifully restored church and surrounds around 7pm where Chimes is located. In the courtyard immediately behind this beautiful church are a number of restaurants that look fantastic. As we wandered around we saw Giardino and noticed that there were only one or 2 empty tables there, where as other restaurants were not as well patronized - usually a good sign i.e. the food is good. Spoke to the waiter who was madly running around serving beautiful looking pizzas about getting a table for 2, sorry all booked out however if we wait for approx 15 minutes should be OK, Waited at the bar and shortly afterwards a table was free. Looked at the menu and chose one of the pizzas that really appealed to us (see photo) and a lovely salad with pomegranate seeds, nuts etc. Service was great, and did not have to wait too long before were munching away into the best pizza both of us have ever eaten. The salad was also to die for. We finished off this lovely meal with a very nice panna cotta. Price overall was comparable to Australian but the meal was much nicer. Subsequently a few night later we both decided that we wanted to experience the same meal again, so 2nd time around equally as nice. The vista at sunset looking at the church wile eating at night is also enchanting. See photo. When I am next in Singapore I will certainly be back to this restaurant
2
Ordered two pizzas for take away back to our hotel. Thought this was a safe bet because you have to really try to bake a bad wood fired pizza. Well, this place did. The crust was flavorless, the cheese was bland, and the sauce, well let's just say it was different. Was really looking forward to this pizza and I was only able to get through two pieces before I threw the rest out. Maybe we just caught them on a bad night.
4
Great Italian like pizza in a superb location.
After more than a week spent in the PRC I was really looking for an Italian pizza, and I found it here in Singapore.
Highly recommend
4
Hunger took over as I was wandering around Singapore and saw a number of people enjoying pizza. Had a Calzone and I was not disappointed. Delivered quickly and hit the mark!
3
For many years I have been enjoying Pizza's at Giardino but since the move after the Chimes renovation I am somewhat disappointed. The Pizza was not as tasty as before. Hopefully it will be better the next time
2
Can a bar serve pizza? Can a pizzeria be a bar as well? Giardino has not yet solved these riddles, and its customers suffer from it.This bar/pizzeria is located in Chijmes, a wonderful area of restaurants at one of the best locations in Singapore.Staff were brusque, and paid more attention to a large group of beer drinkers than us. A smile and a friendly word for valuable customers are less known service aspects in Singapore, but Giardino's staff managed to bring it to a new low for us. We had to ask (well, more like begging) for service several times during our dinner.But.......the pizza was outstanding
4
Our last dinner in Singapore, we spent at this restaurant. The setting is beautiful, the staff and service are really efficient and friendly and the food is fresh and tasty. The happy hour, discounted drinks are wonderful! The pizzas are large and fresh. My son had the duck with veg and chips, which were simply scrumptious. My husband had a seafood pasta, which was also delicious, but the portion size could have been a bit larger, I thought. It is a lovely area to visit and it comes highly recommended
1
In a moment of weakness and poor decision-making we chose this place. Plenty of time to rue what could have been a much better experience. Food was awful (avoid risotto) and service was confused and slow. Three times we were offered food or beverages due to other tables while we were eating our main course! Great setting but that doesn't count for much in the end. Don't bother.
4
This was a nice restaurant, pasta and pizza in the main. Had the gnocchi with cheese, balsamic and walnut sauce which was very tasty, also had two other pizzas which were large and of a good standard. Prices were similar to other restaurants in the area. Service was speedy and attentive, quickly moving use yo an undercover located table on the approach of rain. Nice setting in the renovated Chimes complex opposite Raffles and the Carlton hotels
3
I went here on my own because I was looking for a quick pizza and a glass of wine. The service was cordial, and the pizza was fine. $80 for a salad, a pizza and two glasses of wine seemed a bit expensive to me. I'll try somewhere else next time. Chijmes is a nice place to visit though
4
I went with my girlfriend there for dinner. Attentive staff with good knowledge, I guess he was the manager. Quick service and response to questions. Drinks are okay and the prices too. Soft drinks are served in glasses like small mugs - nice touch. Pizza is good and the pasta but nothing special.
4
If you like smple Italian food this is it. Singapore prices but hey, you're on holiday, enjoy. If this is the one situated on the Singapore river then it is in a great place on Robertson Quay. Buy one get one free during happy hour, at S$14 for a pint it is worth getting there early.
3
Very nice location on the terrasse. Nice atmosphere.
Coktails are at best average
Food is average and really not Italian and low value.
The squid was half cooked !
....
So go there for the location not for the food.
4
Restaurant is within the Chijmes complex, which is a renovated church/convent. The complex had several other bars/restuarants and has a good vibe, and is very close to Fairmont/swisshotel/raffles hotel. worth a visit is staying nearby. Giardino serves pretty good pizza and pasta at reasonable prices.
4
Been both at chijmes and at the new location at Robinson.
Pizza is amongst the best I've tasted outside of Italy.
Very nice staff and reasonably priced considering we're in Singapore
4
We stumbled upon this place while walking along Robertson Quay. We asked a couple sitting outside what the food was like and they said it was great. We found our table and the service was excellent. Food was extremely good value and super tasty. Highly recommend giving this place a go
3
No major complaint but frankly for the price we expected more of an experience. Yes pizzas were good, house wine is below par for sure, risotto tasteless and sticky. desserts average. Atmosphere was nice, outside, not crowded (maybe for a good reason.I am rating Giardino "average" because the staff was lovely. Fodd wise it would be poor

We arrived at this lovely Italian restaurant walking along Robertson Quay, looking for somewhere that would suit a variety of different taste buds & appetites, we are two families that include 4 teenage boys !The pasta and pizza selection was plentiful and I can promise you, the food was very tasty. Not one mouthful was left on the plate and for the average price of around $23-$28 a large pizza it was comparable to Australian prices. The staff were welcoming and we could not fault the service, the young waitress brought me peppermint tea, free of charge, as she thought I looked a little tired...she was spot on. I believe the sister restaurant at Chijmes is the more popular restaurant, but I am happy for that to continue as this will keep this little gem a secret for a little longer.Would definitely recommend this treasure

Am surprised to find only the one in Chijmes listed on TA.Amongst all the bars and restaurants down Robertson Quay, this one is definitely one of the better places for a good nosh. We ordered the seafood pizza which was excellent. The allio olio style pasta didn't disappoint either. And the same went for the smaller dishes we had to snack on.Bottle of house Pinot Grigio was at a decent S$69.00, pretty average for a joint along the river front. Prices of alcohol in SG is always on the high side when you are dining out. I recall it pained me a great deal to pay $21.00 for a glass of diluted whisky at another place across the bridge here !!!All-in-all, wouldn't mind returning again for a pleasant lunch / dinner. Good meal + good conversation + a nice spot for people watching :)

Giardino at Robertson QuayGood food but pricey.$30 for a pizza is quite a lot compared to other nearby restaurants.Lime juice and deserts were lovelyWhen we came to pay the waitress commented that we weren’t very generous – might be worth reminding staff that the size of the tip is in proportion to the standard of service received

One night 5 years ago we were walking down Victoria Str and saw this Huge Chijme.. I myself was a fan of pizza, and i saw the pizzeria. Located in the courtyard made the pizzeria nice and breezy. And the pizza were so good. So every time i come to singapore i always get a big big wood fire oven pizza. And the cold cut were nothing to complain about. But sad to see you close here

A friend and I were walking along Robertson Quay to dine this weekend when we came upon Giardino's set meal offering. $25 for 2 courses and $30 for 3, that too on a weekend!So we sat ourselves outside and glanced through the menu. They had a nice 7-8 antipasti selections for the set meal including a meat & cheese platter and caprese. So we got one each. For the mains, they had quite a few types of pizzas and some pastas too (don't hold me this tho). We each one mixed meat and one meat with artichokes and mushrooms. Both were thin crust and very well made. There was enough meat on each and nothing to complain about. For dessert we got just one tiramisu which was quite good. All in - a great meal for a great price and a wonderful setting/location. Will go back again

Food was great, al fresco was lovely. Service was great. You forget you're in a big city when you're eating in the courtyard...feels more like you are in Europe. Definitely will go back!

We had dinner here recently and ordered the rosemary and garlic pizza and another large pizza. Both were very tasty. The Singapore sling was very tasty as well. The staff were attentive and service was good.

One of my favourite go-to places in Singapore, this restaurant has moved from pretty Chjimes to along the quay front of Roberston Quay which pleases me as it's even closer to my home! It's easily one of the consistently best pizzas I have eaten in Singapore, the portions are giant and the service is great. They have gone slightly more "up market" since the change in venue - nicer quality menus, better furiture etc and if anything I would suggest the quality of the food has increased - but very pleasingly the prices are about the same (affordable). Keep up the great work guys! My one piece of feedback - you need more fans outside as it can get very hot by the quay in the day even with the umbrellas (even just mounting some more on the umbrellas would help)

My wife and I ate at this restaurant 3 times during a weeks stay in Singapore on holiday. I have personally walked past this restaurant many times when I have been in Singapore on business. I visit Singapore approxmately 12 times a year on business and stay in either the Swissotel Stanford hotel or the Fairmont hotel, this restaurant is located in the Chijmes complex. Pizza's are a good size with a very good base, followed by an Afogato it makes fir a great night. Will now stay away from Prego in the Fairmont Hotel and always visit here when I fancy pizza for dinner.Staff were really helpful and plesant, but a little slow

Visited this restaurant a couple if times, and the pizza was ready good (4 cheese with walnuts). Properly oven baked, great quality ingredients and while it's all outside, many heavy duty fans make the temperature bearable! We wanted to go again, but it was raining so there would have been nowhere to sit

We went to this restaurant several times during our 7 nights stay in Singapore, because the staff's attitude was excellent. The food was also tasty and cocktail drinks were well balanced.A guy from Netherland was moaning loudly while he was enjoying his pizza, as if he was eating the most delicious meal in his life. Luckily we had our meal before and knew why he was having so much pleasure. Our guest from home country empathised with him but he did not so extrovertly expressed his thoughts of eating such a delicious meal. We got amazed by watching him as much as sipping our drinks.I do recommend to westerners to try once. The Chijmes has a lot of different cuisines for food and entertainment and a very pleasent atmosphere not to be missed while in Singapore. Don't be discouraged by the signage of renovation from outside the walls

The view of the church and lawn from the restaurant is nice within the walls of CHIJMES. This is a nice and relaxed al fresco dining experience and service is great too. We ordered two pizzas and cocktails. The pizzas tasted fresh and there were lots of toppings. The cocktails were also very well made. I would say the pricing is slightly on the high side however we were glad we dined here.

Visited on a fine evening and sat outside under the trees. Very pleasant. Happy hour was on and a 2 for 1 deal made the bill a bit easier. I had a salad and the staff organised a smaller one for me as a starter. I ordered the chicken pizza. Good crust but topping was a bit bland. I thought the menu was chicken and ham but was in fact chicken ham. It was ok but I don't think appropriate for the location.

The pizzeria seating sits across from the church building with trees and grass so provides an escape from the city bustle outside the walls of CHIJMES.The trees provide shade so its a nice spot, the background music is less appealing - very elevator like and not in keeping with the business concept which is a shame given the marble-like and mosaic tables, the wood oven in the centre. Pizza was nice, service almost too prompt and eager, reasonable price but not cheap (is anywhere cheap?).

We eat here every time we are in Singapore. The pizza is great, the best we have tasted in Singapore. The location is very relaxing, especially if you have kids. It is next to a nice lawn, so your kids can run around between bites of pizza. If there are other families dining then quite often the kids play together, which is nice. I recommend to go during happy hour (18:00 til 19:00 on most days....I think, you might want to check first) because drinks are very expensive ($15 for a glass of wine!!) The drinks price is the main reason I give it 4 starts not 5. The service, food and location are all 5 star, but last time we went our bill came to $180 for 2 adults and 2 kids, which is a bit high for a pizza restaurant.
