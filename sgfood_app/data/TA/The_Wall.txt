Sausage platter was excellent and so were the wings. Reasonably priced and great service. For more intimate gatherings, go for the upper floor.

First time here and was pleasantly surprised by the extensive selection of whiskies, great food and nice atmosphere.

Great service and selection of whisky. Vastly over priced food menu and no option for a lower price snack after pairing menu.

you enter and know you are at the right place seeing all the whiskey and scotch. So you love it.Great collection. The tid bits with whiskey are also nice. Although food wise this place is quite light.The flights are good. My only disappointment was that when your order the flight which comes with 4 shots, the shots are not std 30ml actually. to me they seemed like 20 ml shots or smaller. I could not make it how much they were. but usually I prefer mine with ice, so the moment I put even 1 small ice cube, that seemed too much. Thats a bummer. So if you need a place that will give you a mind blowing choice of whiskey, this is set. but if you want to feel satiated then its going to set you back with a lot of money. Will I go there again, sure, but wait when someone else is paying through company expense.

Stumbled nicely into this bar which also serves good food, almost Japanese in style . The whisky selection is second to none as well as the knowledge behind each of the bottles. There are some very old whiskies available at this bar so don't miss it. Service is very friendly and its a great place to park yourself in an evening after or for dinner. closes at 1 am I think. Enjoy ,watch the wallet as Singapore is not cheap for drinking !

The place was all right and the waitresses were friendly and welcoming. However, the bar tender was very unwelcoming and had an air of arrogance about him. When my partner would inquire about the whiskies on offer the bar tender would give one word responses and gave us the impression that our business was not good enough. The place was nearly empty as there was only one other couple in the bar drinking a beer. So we were a little surprised at the bar tender's demeanour. We had one drink each and decided to move on elsewhere. With the emerging bar scene in Singapore I can name several trendy bars where the bar staff are more professional and welcoming towards their customers

We came here for a late dinner. It's not really a dinner place, more of a drinking place with food. The food was good, but over-priced. The whisky selection was ok, but the Japanese whiskeys were seriously over-priced. I like the Nikka but it was way over priced at $500+ per bottle, Yamazaki was even worse. We ended up getting a boutique bourbon which was more reasonably priced, but for a Japanese whisky bar, they price the Japanese whiskies out of range, it sort of ruins the concept a bit. We first ordered the Glenrothes but it was out of stock (unless its a really rare vintage or small boutique, there's no excuse to be out of stock). On to the food. We had a few Izakaya style dishes and the food was very good, but a bit expensive. The uni (sea urchin) was fresh with a nice creamy taste served in the shell. It was excellent with an excellent price to match (~$60). The Hamachi kama (yellow tail head) was very good, skin crispy but not overcooked which is not easy to do. The chicken wings were melt off the bone and also delicious. The only item we weren't happy with was the yasai mori to start, the cabbage was wilted, not crispy - it's a shame to get that wrong! Otherwise, the food was very good, we had a nice bourbon and we will go back from time to time, but it is quite expensive. The decor is quite cramped with a red brick wall that really defines it. The wall could have been decorated to give the place more character, as it is, the ambiance is a bit generic and the club chairs upstairs weren't even real leather ... with genuine club chairs and some interested art work it could be cool, but as is looks a bit unfinished. Overall, a good place to go if you're looking for a type of high end Izakaya food and drink (the food was good) with overpriced Japanese whiskeys but reasonably priced whiskies from other regions
