was there with our friends of 8 for late sweet tooth craving. The choco drink are just awesome. Desserts such as waffle with ice cream are good too. Good place for the sweet tooth.

Nice presentation of desserts and a great place for choco lovers to be. A place you can consider hanging out with friends after dinner. However, they have to step up on the services and cleanliness of the tables.

My 2nd visit here ... I just can't get enough of their Max-wich! Oh ... And the Mocha Frappe too! Yummy! If you're a chocolate addict this is a to go place!

We ordered a white chocolate drink and a Mexican spicy hot chocolate. Both were served using the hug mug. The Hug Mug was cute but it was too hot to "hug" it. A good experience with the spicy hot chocolate.

First time to visit a chocolate bar. From milkshakes to crepes, to a variety of other chocolate concoctions, this was a memorable experience. Our group tried four different items, and then shared. Everything was great!

The chocolate bar is a must visit for your sweet tooth cravings ! We had the chocolate pasta - fettucine style chocolate crepes, a block of white chocolate with a grater to represent cheese, ice cream, chocolate sauce, bits of hazelnut and butterscotch to add to the crunch and chocolate balls for toppings. It was pure delight !! The menu is expensive but totally worth it.

It was my first visit to this dessert restaurant! We ordered some waffles with bananas and also a few chocolate drinks. Definitely unforgettable experience! I would not be hesitant to pay for the quality of the food at this restaurant. From their gestures, I believe this restaurant took pride in their food and make sure they deliver high quality products!

Pretty much everything here is chocolate, but they do it very well! The hot chocolate is amazing and just like a real one should be. The hot brownie is great as well. Their "Choc Chunk Pizza" is, however, not great and really a waste of time and money

A good variety of food choices. It is like a dessert bar as all choices have chocolates in it. The waffle was very nice and the serving is quite a good amount. The cookies are nice too. Definitely a good place to have dessert after meals or during snacks

They have everything that a chocolate lover dreams of. I love their fondue and would definitely go back for more.

This MB is miles away from the Max Brenner in Australia. The hot chocolates were way too sweet for $7 each small hot chocolate was a waste.
That is the reason why the cafe is empty.

I'm not a chocolate lover but family members are, so we went here and did tried, surprisingly it was nice, in fact not bad at all...something new to me yet desirable
I tried chocolate pizza, will definitely come again...

Its nothing like the website, i walked passed several times trying to find it. Hot chocolate was great though

Having just moved over from Sydney, I was craving a Max Brenner chocolate brownie. I was so excited to find there was a Max Brenner outlet in Singapore. Unfortunately the brownie did not live up to standard. It was somewhat moist in the centre, but the sides were dry and overheated. The chocolate sauce it came with tasted watery - nothing like the delicious thick chocolate sauce that you get in Sydney. I left without finishing my brownie which is a first in my life. :

Win over your chocolate cravings in Singapore by visiting Max Brenner. Enjoyed the chocolate fondue which comes with milk, and dark chocolate pots, maple syrup, cookies, strawberries and marshmallows. Just when we thought this was not enough, we also tried the chocolate lava cake, which was amazing as well. Recommended for all the chocolate lovers!

What is really good: iced latte. Served very nicely with a metal straw - cool on all accounts. Espresso was very very ordinary to below ordinary. But the presentation was awesome (with chocolate). Scone was really delicious but it was more of a cake than a scone. Not sure if I should have come here for espresso but my first MB experience was ok.

We went there on our churros tasting spree. 8 pieces of churros come with 2 types of chocolate sauces (we can choose between dark, milk & white), raspberry mush & 2 strawberries for $20. Overall pricey compared to value offered, but not bad. The churros are crisp and the pearl sugar on it delightful. But there is is hardly any taste of the soft centre. I like my churros to be crisp on outside and melting soft inside. But those who like lighter version, this is a great choice. My daughter liked the white chocolate but I was disappointed with the dark chocolate. Tasted out of a jar and not worthy of a place specializing in chocolate. The raspberry mush & strawberries was a good addition. The location is a winner. Service for us was not as bad as many before me have noted. The girl at the counter was friendly and the guy serving us was disinterested, but no problem with the order.

I have been a frequent patron of Max Brenner and I have almost tried everything from their menu. I have to say they have lost their charm. The Menu is pretty much the same since day one. I feel that as a chocolate speciality place, they need to keep updating their menu at least once year. If that's not possible, be a little bit more creative and come up with a dessert and drink of the month. Its so boring to try the same old drinks and desserts. I'm so glad that they have stopped giving out menus which were so shabby that you will think twice about dinning there if its your first time. Now, you have to read it out from the board and place your order, make the payment and your food and drinks will be delivered to your table. This outlet is pretty packed on weekends, especially after 7 so be prepared to wait for a while to be seated. As for the hot chocolate, you have three choices to choose from. Milk, dark or white. You may add some flavours to it by adding an espresso shot or caramel syrup for a small surcharge. The hot chocolate tastes good but its not hot enough and tad sweeter. The 80s milk shakes are fantastic. As for the desserts, skip everything except OMG chocolate chunk cookie and the chocolate soufflé. Churros are excessively dusted with sugar and cinnamon. I couldn't taste the coffee flavour in the Tiramisu. The S'mores dessert was a total let down and the waffles were just passable. Do note that you have to wait 15 to 20 minutes for the chocolate soufflé but i can assure you its worth the wait.Overall, it's just an average dessert place that needs a menu change very badly

The cafe is tucked in a nice corner in the VivoCity mall. I ordered for a hot chocolate in the hug-mug. The mug is cute and the idea quite novel. But on the two occasions that I visited the place, it didn't seem to have hot chocolate...only lukewarm! It was quite a disappointment and the service is just about average. You may want to bunk the cuteness of the hug-mug and head out somewhere else for a hot mug of 'hot' chocolate
