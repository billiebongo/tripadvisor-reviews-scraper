Excellent food. However the service was equally brilliant- all smiling and arcing without any issues. Very proactive and unbelievably quick. Highly recommend a visit to this cafe.

I really like the smoked duck and orange salad.
The pulled pork is also really yummy.
An easy laid back place with nice food.

We passed on the way back to the hotel and it looked like a good spot, so we showered, changed and headed back. It was very busy with only a couple of tables left so we ended up on a high stool. There were lots of guys obviously straight from work having a few drinks and sorting the world out. It was good to be among them as that's my type of atmosphere, but if you want a nice quiet romantic dinner maybe choose another venue, or come later when the boys have all gone home. I had the pork chop and it was well cooked and well presented. It came with shoestring fries which were a tad overdone. For desert I had churros; not exactly common over here and in fact the waitress did not even know they served them! They were however delicious. I also sampled Asahi Black, which is a new beer but obviously very popular here. Apart from the black colour it remains distinctly Asahi. I did however try a couple of the Connors Stout Porter. On the menu it says "UK" by the side of this which is in fact very misleading. It is brewed in Malaysia by Carlsberg. They would argue that it is a UK Porter copy, but it doesn't quite meet that standard. All up a great night and only a few hundred metres to roll home happy

The market we had intended to eat at was too noisy and too hot, so as the Rookery was straight across the road and time was getting on we decided to try it. Straight away we were shown to a table, given a menu and our drink orders taken; the food came along reasonably quickly and was delicious. Both the girl serving our table and the man who brought the drinks were friendly and professional. My husband dropped his knife and almost before he picked it up the young lady was at the table with a clean one, which showed that they were keeping an eye on their customers in order to see to their needs.But we were surprised, when we got the bill, to find that a 10% surcharge had been added. As New Zealanders tipping does not come naturally to us but we are happy to give a tip for good service, but we would rather give it directly to the person who served us than have it added to the bill

We canme for brunch after waking up late. The wife ordered a croque monsier and I had the salmon wrap. The coffee and food were delicious, and the location is quite nice as it is facing one of the iconic markets which has stood there for 50 years.The cafe itself looks nice on the inside as well, although it might be wise to visit after 3pm to avoid the madness of the lunch crowd.All in all, great experience, good service and will be back if I get the chance

We stumbled across this place looking for somewhere to go for breakfast. The draw was that coffee was $1 with breakfast. I was sold. The food was delicious and the coffee was great. Hubby had a white hot chocolate which was overly sweet but everything else was grea

We decided to go for something to eat after work and having walked past the Rookery every day decided to give it a go. We were shown to a table and given a menu, then we waited and waited. Finally we caught someones attention only to be told there were only two items available on the menu as this evening they were doing Tapas only and presented with another menu to look at. Our order was taken and the food took rather a long time to come. Was it worth the wait? No pretty poor! When the bill came we felt it was really poor value! We wont be going back

I have been a customer of The Rookery for 18 months. Over that time, I would rate their service and food & beverage as good. But over recent months they have dispensed with the need to have a competent barista pulling their coffees. Instead, we have staff who are more comfortable working the cash register performing this task. On 26 August this culminated in me collecting a take away cappuccino that was mainly froth. The 'barista' clearly didn't understand the need to settle the milk once it was heated. Making a good coffee should be a necessity not a 'nice to have' for an establishment such as this

Quick business meeting over lunch and coffee? This is a good place. We both had salads, mine roast pumpkin with lots of green things, but it was very tasty I have to admit. Colleague had the roast duck salad, also looks good. Coffee was ordered specifically and came as I asked, uber hot! Thanks team, will be back. It gets busy so get in early

A fairly new venue in the business Central Business District (CBD), openning late 2015, at the base of the Hong Leong building on the Cross Street side,facing the Lau Pa Sat hawker market. With a nice roomy feel, there are enough claustrophobic coffee shops in this area, due to the high rents the district commands, gaining popularity with the after work community keen to exploit the generous happy hours often popular with new venues as they establish themselves in a highly competitive marketplace.Not the best coffee in the business district, but pretty good nonetheless, with friendly and enthusiastic staff, a fully stocked bar, including a choice of draught beers, a nice vibe for chilling or catching up on a little laptop time, and pretty good wifi.I can recommend the Smoked Salmon and Sunny Side eggs with rocket on toast, although I went for poached eggs, which appeared within minutes, despite the order amendment, well presented, tasty and only $22 with a flat white.Sadly, for those keen for a new weekend option, not currently open Saturday, or Sunday
