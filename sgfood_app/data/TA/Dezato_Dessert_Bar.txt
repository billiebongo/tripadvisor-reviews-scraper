This is a rare find of a good Japanese restaurant. Serve seasonal Japanese catch at reasonable price. Bento is cheap and good and if you have an in-door function, they can do catering as well.

We wanted somewhere Japanese near Raffles Place where we were staying that served Teriyaki salmon, and this restaurant hit the spot.It is in an area with dozens of other restaurants, and many small food courts in commercial buildings, so it is always going to fight for business, especially because so few people have reviewed it on Tripadvisor.Whilst they had a set meal of Chicken & Salmon Teriyaki we don't eat meat so they simply removed the chicken and served a more than adequate set meal including miso soup, salmon sashimi, teriyaki salmon, steamed rice and green tea.All this cost SGD15 (US$12) per person; much cheaper than any other restaurant in this area.The service was excellent and staff friendly; we'll return when on our next trip to Singapore

The boat quay area is surrounded with "ok that was decent" places. Dezato was a step (or two) above. Slightly surprisingly since there was a menu outside with the usual sets, the same thing one sees with many of the mediocre places at the nearby Central mall. But it was very solid. On the first visit I had a beef set for just short of $20. It is frequent to have beef that has plenty of tendon /ligament. This one was very smooth. The tempura side was crispy and light, the rice quality solid, as was the miso soup. Only the tuna sashimi was a bit chewy, but for the price can't really complain.I also went for a weekend lunch, had a chicken terikayaki that was perfectly lightly battered. The chawanmushi was a bit tepid on the inside but tasty nonetheless and without that horrible fake-fish cake that is often found. It also came with a few pieces of (very cold) salmon sashimi. For $14, i left happy

Dezato offers kaiseki at an affordable price : 60 SGD nett onwards.I had a 6-course meal at Dezato.The sashimi (sanma, shimaji and sujiko) were very fresh and the sushi were well-made. Chef Derrick was around to explain each and every dish to us too.I have no major complaints about any of the food items. They were generally well-executed if not excellent. I enjoy the Citrus Sorbet with Wine Jelly alot, it was very refreshing and unique

This restaurant may sound like just a dessert place but it is also a rare place for Japanese Kaiseki. Kaiseki is a range of traditional Japanese food (5 to 10 small dishes served separately) which is first a feast to the eyes before you can savor every dish. It is comparable with Bobby Flay cooking and explaining to you while you give your rating on every dish. Between sixty to a hundred dollars per person, this is a steal
