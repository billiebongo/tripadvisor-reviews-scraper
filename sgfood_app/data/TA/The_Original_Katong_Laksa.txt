I know it is a subjective view but having tired Laksa in many locations across Singapore and MY I still end up coming back to this place. They offer good value for money and large portions. The quality is simply outstanding
4
Great tasting Laksa served quickly and a brilliant choice for late nights, as the place open late. Would be happy to visit again.
3
As a local, I dont like this laksa. There are better tasting laksa out there. It is definitely overpriced and a tourist bait.
4
We ordered laksa for takeaway and for good measure also bought otak otak and nasi lemak. The laksa is good and the broth delicious. I also enjoyed the otak otak. But the nasi lemak is not worth the calories as it lacks in substance.
4
Try the Laksa or the Nasi Lemak with otak otak. These are great local food that can fill your tummy at all times. Best of all, it's affordable.
5
One of the best laksa soup place in katong Singapore.it has a wide range if laksa that you can order. Every time I visit Singapore this is the place to have a authentic laksa without a doubt! Highly recommend!
5
Rich Gravy, simply tasty. I can finish two big bowls.
I would rank it the best Laksa in Singapore.
Parking though is a headache and the food is getting expensive over the years.
4
They've grown and their prices have flown up north. It's a dish that requires some effort to prepare, but quickly eaten (slurped). It's fastfood or as we call it in Singapore, hawker food. Sadly, some take hawker food, which is meant to be affordable to the local public, and have the prices jerked upwards because of some media mention.Granted this version has history behind them, still we should remain humble to our loyal customers. Not this Katong Laksa though. Sadly

328 Katong Laksa shot to fame after having beaten Gordan Ramsay in the SingTel Hawker Heroes challenge in 2013. Thanks to Adam Liaw and Destination Flavour Singapore, we now know that the soup is a special combination of chilli oil, dried shrimp, coconut milk and the secret ingredient - evaporated milk. After the short-cut noodles get heated up using the same broth, various toppings including bean sprout, fish cake, cockles and prawns are placed around the bowl, then finished off with shredded laksa leaves.We ordered a large bowl to share and quite adored the creamy soup, gritty dried shrimp and fresh prawns. The cockles on the other hand were quite slimy and tasted off. Despite the immense popularity this was hands down our least favourite Katong laksa place . We found it commercialised, the most expensive for its serving size with the least fresh ingredients. It, by no means, was a bad bowl of laksa, we just didn't feel the love
5
Didn't what was to eat in Singapore. Searched and came "Laksa". So we went to 328 Katong to try it... and it was an awesome experience, we loved it. With Laksa on top, the other finger food like options are also really good.If could I would have one now, but I'm too far away already :DBy the way it is filled with locals, so it is a good sign for the real thing.Be aware of the not too spice - it is spicy for those who are not so used to it
5
We went today for Laksa at 328 and it was fabulous! We had a great chat with the owner and he explained us why his Laksa became so famous. If you really want to try the Singaporean taste you need to visit this place.
5
I couldn't fine any place have a laksa like this deep, savoy and beautiful flavor. It wasn't easy to go from some touristic place, you will have the best in Singapore. Try it.
4
A very good laksa, had a number around Singapore but this is in the top rank. Very good price too! ( For those who worry, Grade A rated for good hygiene- I personally don't go below a B!!)
5
The laksa had incredible flavor. The large bowl had three shrimp and lots of cockles. Cooked perfectly. The Lime Juice was delicious. There was a queue at 9am when it opened.If you stay at the Village Hotel Katong, walk out the back door, cross the street and turn right. It is on the corner
4
Review by Dr Sim. The laksa is good. Gravy is bit thin. Sir Gordon Ramsey's photo is on the wall together with HK actors eg. I think it looks like Donnie Yen, and Patrick Tse, father of Nicky. Air-conditioned. Small tables and stools. Ambience is basic. Laksa is pricey at $5.50 for small bowl. Some cockles inside. Tourists could try. Self service. Regards Dr Si
5
One of the best Seafood Laksas that I've had. Rich, creamy and full of flavour. Had the Thai coconut to drink along with it. The decor isn't fancy, but the ambience and atmosphere is really nice and has all the good qualities of a good hawker style restaurant.
3
I had heard so much about this place, especially from a TV Food show recently, that I thought I had to try it. I absolutely LOVE LAKSA but was disappointed with this place, the flavour just wasn't quite right for me. It was okay, nice enough but I have had better.Best Laksa I had was from a little place in The Esplanade MRT Underground for $4.50 a bowl, it really packed a punch will definitely go back there for my laksa fi
4
We loved the Laksa. Not as fancy as some of the big hotels but for $7 for a large bowl I can't complain. The ingredients were fresh and the gravy a perfect balance. Make sure you stroll down Joo Chiat Street and check out the wonderful shops and houses.
4
The laksa soup base was thick & flavourful while the otak (fish paste grilled in coconut frond was also good. The chilli paste in a satchel is hot & spicy so go easy. Fresh lime drink was perfect beverage to accompany the meal. Skip the nasi lemak which was quite plain unless you're a fan
5
328 Katong Laksa is the only reason why I visit this neck of the woods whenever I am in town and it never disappoints. A cursory search on the web will describe how popular it is and they attest that this is the #1 in Singapore. I totally agree. A little odd to eat Laksa with just a Chinese soup spoon but the noodles are cut short so it's easy to spoon in each mouthful along with the delicious gravy soup that must be the secret crabby paddy formula that is the crown jewel of this winning dish.
4
Yumm, at only $5 a bowl. Self service but no problem with quene
Had other items on the menu, Total cost $25 for two person, 2 x Laksa, 2 x drinks, plus three other dishes
3
Occasionally, I will come to skating Laksa for dinner. Problem with this place is lack of parking space. A bit pricey. Still one of the best place for Laksa.
3
laksa was ok, but wasn't my style or flavour, i prefer mine to have more sweet and with coconut milk
5
They have 3 outlets and i visited the one at Queensway Shopping Centre. The Laksa was ok but what was really nice was the chicken curry. This place is pretty popular but turnaround is pretty fast so don't have to wait lonng.
5
This is definitely one of the best meal I have eaten in Singapore. I heard about Katong laksa long time ago in Malaysia. It was maybe someone put the name as Katong laksa but I pay no attention to it until I tried it at East Coast. Was happen to have a discussion around the area I tried it as voila, the laksa that win Ramsay by 19% votes. Damn syiok! Will definitely return for moarrrr
5
Went here with family as part of a Katong good tour - and so glad we did! Laksa so rich and creamy and full of flavour - Best laksa ever eaten. If you like Malay and like laksa, visit here. There's a reason why Gordon Ramsay visited here to learn the recipe!!
4
We were staying in the nearby Hotel Indigo while visiting my in-laws in Singapore. One cousin suggested this stall just a couple of doors away on the first floor of Roxy Square. The laksa is typical of that in the Katong area, noodles cut small on meant to be eaten with a spoon. It's much better laksa than that found at the 328 chains that populate this (and other) neighborhoods. 328 rested on its laurels long ago. This place is quite good. It doesn't match the laksa at Sungei Road Laksa in Jelan Besar or a couple of the stalls at Kovan Food Center, but it is certainly the best in the quaint Katong area. It's worth a stop if if you're in that historic area
4
This laska place is quite popular with tourists and not so much with locals and laksa aficionados. Personally, I thought it was quite good. Although not exceptionally amazing, it had all the right flavors. It is self-service and so there is not much to expect in that regard. Do give it a go if you want to see the hype.
3
Checked through the hotel for 328 Laksa with a Michelin recognition and mention of the celebrity chef Gordon Ramsey. At the reception I was advised that it is across the road.The restaurant is conveniently located on East Coast Road, Katong. I ordered, paid for the Laksa & waited.When the self service Laksa arrived it was not as expected.I pointed to the picture & queried I ordered that. The chef just chuckled and said this is seafood.Disappointed I ate and left
1
Very average laksa, bland and lacked any punch. I watched a program in Australia about this place and they pumped it up a bit. I could safely say i could make better. No lie! The oyster in the laksa tasted slightly off as well . (I didnt get crook from it though) I tried a laksa in bangkok that ran rings around 328 !! The waiter was a little grumpy and unwelcoming and we tried our best to make him smile !! Sorry , not worth trip . The lime juice was very nice though .
2
It's a real disappoint when you go visit the main joint in Katong a small place and few chairs
Food lakes you get in any hawker Center around Singapore and some other Assam Laksa is lot better
4
Good reliable Laksa. Noodles already cut so only a spoon needed! So many good Laksa's in Singapore, this is one of them.
1
Expensive. Tasteless. Swill like broth
This place only survives as a tourist destination. But I doubt it can rest on its laurels any longer. First and last time trying katong laksa.
5
If you are travelling Singapore and you like o eat local food this is the best place you shoud try. One laksa $3 plus only. Also you can try "Ottha". Its something like dry fish. really nice. Highly recommended for travellers around the world.
4
This serves Laksa and very little else. The Laksa is delicious, but the surroundings were very basic and the service was somewhat surly.
4
I met a senior citizen who recommended me this quaint laksa shop. Its located on the Ground Floor of Roxy Square, which is next to Katong Plaza. Walk past the travel agency and you will come across a few shops selling food and drinks, and The Original Katong Laksa is shop number 2. Its laksa is served piping hot and comes in three sizes. Different from the red curry laksa variety- this has a nyonya twist to it and you can smell the intoxicating herbs and you consume each bite.Definitely like this one
2
With a tagline that says "famous katong laksa", i can only say it is meant for the tourists. There's taste in the soup (gravy=thick which this is not) and the sambal is spicy but not much else can be said about the quality. At 9 in the morning, the soup is just warm but i assume they serve it hot as the day progresses
2
Quality: AverageTaste: AverageService: 'You owe them a living'Price: AveragePersonal opinion so please do not criticize. It ain't the same laksa anymore. Spicy yes but the taste of authentic laksa is totally off. Price is on the high side and frankly, the ingredients is seriously little. Service? Forget about service.However, no harm to try it. Opt for the small bowl (it's enough to fill your stomach).Have fun and enjoy
3
Visited 328 katong laksa@51 east coast rd. The laksa soup tasted good but there is nothing else in it besides a few pieces of fried fish cake with no prawn. Wondered if this is the way katong laksa should be but found the photo shown on the wall clearly displayed 3 prawns.It is not delivered as advertised. Besides, attitude of the staff in the self service shop is blunt & unfriendly
3
Laksa was good enough in terms of topping qualities. The soup was little weak. The noodle was fine. Nasi Lemak, I had a lot better one than here. Otah was nice not too spicy. I brought my visitor friends with me to checked out this famous place.
3
Their standard dropped and also the price increased. We can find other nicer & cheaper Laksa in other places.
4
The laksa here is tasty.The service is fast fast food style. The The ambiance is good.You can sit inside the air-conditioned area.or can sit outside.The ambience is O K.
4
Love the laksa! If you're looking for authentic this the place. Caution: not poshy no candle lights no need for pradas or jimmy choos. Just Laksa and you're done!
4
gravy is thick, and it's good value for money. love to have its unique chilli sauce with laksa leaves in it.
4
This is one of the places I'd recommend for good local cuisine. Def one of the best laksa in Singapore. Do try the otah too. Otah which is grilled Chilli fish paste goes well w laksa
3
My local friend took us to this famous Laksa place, first thing you would notice on the wall is full of celebrity photos including Gordon Ramsay. The soup base was excellent, but a too spicy for me. Noodles cut into small pieces, which I don't prefer, as it don't really feel like eating noodles
4
One of the best Laksa's I've ever had, but date night haunt, candle lit romance, crooning waiter service..... not tonight compadre, yous picked the wrong plastic stools and 30c serviette hangout I'm afraid, but travelling with my kindle for company with a Laksa packed with goodies including a heap of oysters u have found hom
1
I think these guys have over-traded on their name and reputation. So much so that the service is just awful now. I've bought laksa before to take home for my family and these guys charge 50 cents more per order to use their fancy take away containers. Comes to quite a lot when you order for 6! So this time around, I decided to bring my own containers. It's good to encourage people to do this anyway, so we generate less waste. You know what? They STILL insisted that I paid the extra charges! No reason other that it's a takeaway! This is the last time I will buy anything from them. It's sad when their profit margins become more important than the customer
5
This is a must try. The noodles are cut into smaller pieces. Only spoons are provided. The curry is way too creamy for you to stay awake on a hot afternoon. It's so good that the taste still lingers in my mouth;)It comes with sambal, a chillie paste of sorts. Ask for extra and they'll generously provide all you need.  I took a picture of the interior of the place. It's the closest to Malacca if you miss peranakan food.
4
Whenever we mention about Katong laksa, people will think about the 328 Katong laksa located near the overhead bridge.Well, I must say the "The original katong laksa from the 50s" should be the one we give the thumb up. It comes with a very traditional and unique nonya taste and slightly mild which taste comfortably.It is located at first floor in Roxy square (Katong). The western food stall "Strands and Grains" also another hidden gem which sells very good grilled steak and fish and cheap.Not to mention the Rojak stall which comes with an unique prawn paste.A good choice for an economical meal if you are around that area
5
If you are looking for a good Laksa to eat and you are in Katong, you gotta have this! The soup base is so rich and yummy you will wanna have another bowl!
5
I just keep coming back, fast, delicious, good value for money. My favourite place for quick lunch in Katong
5
One of my favorite in Singapore.
I went Singapore for severour times. But never had Laksa before.
I went there with one of my colleagues which is a Singaporean.
The curry and seafood taste was amazing!
And the price is very cheap.
3
Another dinner place where I will go if I have no better place to eat. Food is average, the prawns are always overcooked and tasteless.
5
the best laksa and the place is always packed with visitors
the menu is basically only laksa, but that's all you need there.
4
One of my fave dish is Laksa, tho I never found the wrong one in Singapore, but this one is quite different.They just put prawn and mussel into the dish. And their combination is amazing!Very tasty and very unique.A good choice if you want to eat a halal food, since pork and lard is everywhere in Singapore.And nowadays, they open many branch, as delicious as the original.The one that I try is at The Park on Alexandra St, next to IKEA.And if you want to take some munchies to hotel, I suggest to buy the nasi lemak that they wrapped and ready to go. Only $2 and quite a portion!
2
Being somewhat of a laksa aficianado, I was really disappointed with the quality of the laksa served here. For my taste it was too milky and rich and failed to pack a punch flavour wise. Sorry, but my favourite local noodle place in Sydney does a much better job
4
I love laksa I have it at home in Australia when I can. As far as I could tell this restaurant only does laksa. At $7 for a large bowl its great value I can spend $20 in aus. The spice is low to medium and they provide chilli at the table for those of us who like to boost that chilli feeling. Great taste and so close to other bars etc.
4
The place gets crowded very fast, and it also packs a punch. Remb that parking will be a problem so best come in publuc transport.Laksa is chilli and so its spicy, do watch out or else just dowb a cup of fresh lime juice. Bring tissue to clean off your sweat
2
Used to be way better than its current state. There used to be a 329 Katong Laksa, directly opposite who competed with this current Katong Laksa. That stall tasted better to be honest.Other than Laksa, the stall sells also Nasi Lemak and Otah, which I find it pretty bizarre. But I guess they're trying to do variety.I used to crave and would travel down for a bowl. No longer now. The soup has gone diluted and taste has gotten pretty bland.Wouldn't recommend it. Some people still find it good, yes, but in a general sense, there's better Laksa out there.
4
Worth the lines, though one night they closed early it seemed. A bit spicy but delicious. Good people watching too as it's a mix of locals and tourists.
5
Service and food was excellent with a wide variety of meals to choose from. If you like your soups or meals with a bit of spice you won't be disappointed
2
Prior to their changes ..this used to be one of the best in Singapore ..but with their franchise program ...the quality had fallen ..I would not go out of my way for their laksa
5
Recommended by my brother's friend who lives in Singapore, and it was the best Laksa I have every enjoyed. We had a 6 hour layover and it was worth the taxi ride in to enjoy some noodles!
5
Must try, good price, decent size and delicious. Extra chilli for those who like laksa hot. Make sure you take a packet of tissues. Definitely would recommend :)
3
Katong Laksa is a must try in the area and there used to be many stores touting to be the original. 328 has been there for as long as I could remember and one of a couple still surviving. From outdoor seating, they expanded to provide indoor air-conditioned and recently downsized again. The standard has been fluctuating over the years. The ingredients portion have also been shrinking due probably due to rising costs. I no longer eat this every week but only when there's a craving or when I'm in the area
3
Katong Laksa is a must when you visit the Katong area. That said, it can also be had at various other places across town among which at Holland Village. And as it goes... the quality is consistent in all these places. The one on the corner of East Coast Road and Ceylon Road is said to be the original one but there is little left of the original stall and vibe of the place. They recently refurbished and the restaurant is now a squeeky clean indoor affair that likes what it once had. Still, the laksa is as it always was, no worries there. If you want a more authentic experience head to the Roxy Square mall across the road. The ground floor hawker center (indoors) has another laksa stall. They say (though shouting matches have happened over this as well) that this one is even more original than the super famous one across the road. Personally I prefer the laksa at this shopping center but the differences are certainly not huge.
5
We tried the Laksa here and it was creamu compared to the rwst of the Laksa we tasted, the spoon itself is full of flavor.. feom roasted dried shrimp to the flavor of the shrimp heads... its all present. The creamy soup has evap milk and coconut milk. This is something you can not cook at hom
5
Laksa - still nothing beats Katong laksa for my taste buds! There is nowhere in the Philippines that I can find something like this. Even me, I once tried out a simple laksa recipe courtesy of Del Monte Philippines' Kitchenomics but never did I taste something like the Singaporean laksa does. Its playful flavors are just so perfect that I keep on missing 'coz I can only taste it there
5
One of the best Laksas I ever tried. Nice flavor and if you need more spice, don't worry there are chilly paste on the table. The noodles are already pre cut so you only need a spoon to eat and chance that to mess ur clothes are low
4
Oh how spoilt I am with their laksa. Deliciously rich!!
Want it more spicy? Add on ur chilly paste!
Never been a laksa fan... but nw yes...
Self service, tables indoor & outdoor, can be crowded during peak hrs.
3
a great place to get authentic Laksa at the traditional coffee shop price. The restaurant has recently had a minor 'facelift' with more air-con but the real attraction is that yummy laksa. Hard to beat!
3
One of the most overrated laksa every. I guess to each his own but frankly, there is better to be had in malaysia or indonesia. Please do try and after you do, hopefuly you will inderstand what I mean.
4
go early to get best laksa. new seating in aircon is good! Although miss some of the old staff. Will be back many times
5
This is the place for Laksa in Singapore. The whole island comes here during weekends. Place is crowded but always worth the wait. This is simply the best laksa you can find on this little red dot. Highly recommended.
5
Luksa is one of my favorites and this store sells the best last in Singapore. Not too spicy. Tastes just enough and they put a lot of tofu. I think they use different kind of tofu
5
im not a people who like laksa much, but after i tried their laksa, i blown away with their laksa, its mind blowing, i become addict to their laksa, definitely worth to try, the soup really rich of taste, i suggest you to try the medium portion since the small one it too small and the big one is too big for me.
4
We were staying at the Village Hotel Katong and were delighted to find that 328 Laksa that was recommended in the Scoot magazine was just behind the hotel (the address online says 51/53 East Coast Road, but I'm guessing this is the same place). What luck! We really enjoyed our laksa that had tons of yummy seafood but that didn't smell overly fishy - just enough that you know it's real
5
Forgive my ignorance, with only 2 days in Singapore I didn't have an opportunity to compare too many places but this one struck me as solid gold. They serve pretty much one dish - and it is perfect, with rich, complex flavor, and great taste. The fact that is cheaper than a chain fast food joint helps too - but it would be still good at twice the price
5
Went here as part of a two part lunch, 1st part being roti prata with mutton curry. I'm guessing total caloric consumption was between "take your Lipitor" and "myocardial infarction imminent". But I digress. Perfect bowl of laksa. Good curry:coconut milk ratio. Noodles cut to spoon size so no chopsticks required. Usual shrimp, fishcake mix. Price was ~$US5 for the large. More than enough food unless you're wearing an elastic waistband.Notable: It's an actual restaurant and you can eat inside or outside. I think they even have AC for tourists like me.Eat here
5
Just a perfect dish of Laksa. Not many seats so coming a bit off-peak may be a thing to consider... If you like Laksa it is definitely worth going there.
5
Reasonably priced and certified yummy. Will definitely go baxk here nd bring some more of my friends to make them have its taste too
4
Our first time eating laksa. Certainly not our last!! The laksa was delicious! Okay, this is absolutely not fine dining, sitting on the pavement on plastic stools, but maybe the best part of Singapore is that eating in places like these is safe.
4
Katong laska never fails to satisfy my craving. It has always been good. The standard did drop slightly compared to the past. But its still as good. However the price is rather steep.
4
Laksa with "hom" and if possible, a little shredded chicken meat is FANTASTIC!!!! I had two bowls! But depending on the weather, if it's too hot, perhaps you'd want to sit in the air-conditioned area.
3
i always love to eat Katong laksa and it actually renovated since the last visit. Nice!Price increased but there's no longer "medium" size order available. :( Katong laksa overall still yummy but today the noddles a little overcooked. *Just some suggestion, maybe if possible to prepare few baby chairs for the convenient of customers with babies.
5
I was in Singapore last weekend and was staying at the Grand Mercure Roxy. After reading reviews about nearby restaurants, I decided to try the Laksa at 328 Katong Laksa. I ordered the small bowl and the Nasi lemak. The laksa was so yummy, wasn't too spicy.. I would like it to be more spicy, but then I grew up eating chilli most days, so it's just me.. However the Laksa was indeed very tasty, yummy, creamy.. Just yumm.. In the other hand, did not really like the Nasi lemak. It was just steamed rice with a small fried fish and some ikan bilkis (fried baits) wrapped in banana leaves. Now travellers, next time you are in Singapore, a visit to katong laksa is a big MUST. Can't wait to go back..
5
The place was recommended by our taxi driver who drove us from the airport. According to our driver tbis was one of the best laksa house in the area and he was right. The shop only sells laksa and nasi lemak (rice with fried fish). We had both laksa as well as nasi lemak although we could do without nasi lemak, laksa was delicious and rich in flavor. I recommend this place if you are a laksa fan like us.
3
Disgusting environment with heaps of flies. Doesn't provide menu to customers. Unfriendly service.There were so many flies in the restaurant that I just wanted to quickly finish my food and leave.Couldn't tell if it was good laksa or not. Even good lakes becomes bad lakes in that type of dirty environment
4
If you want nothing but authentic, good, honest local laksa then this is the place to go. It's all about the food. You have a limited choice (it's called Katong Laksa for a reason!) but can get a medium or large - no one would want small! Don't go for a romantic dinner or quite bite because the atmosphere is strictly street, noisy, busy and bustling. Go for the Laksa though. It's excellent (and cheap).
5
Sat out by the street and enjoyed a wonderful bowl. I will be eating here again before I head back to the states.
5
Must try! The laksa was really good, goes really well with the ready-made lemonade. And the best part for me was the otak-otak! Haven't had that good of otak-otak for a while, and I'm from Malaysia so I guess that says a lot. :)
4
Definitely a well deserved "Very Good", people will go here regardless as it's a long standing and popular establishment
Try not to allow the hype to get your expectations too high as a simple bowl of cut up noodles will satisfy but not wow you
5
Visited twice in my short trip to Singapore and the laksa here is absolutely awesome. This place have become my favourite... Must visit if you like laksa
5
When in Singapore, one must have a Laksa soup... If you have never tried it, you can't miss it, if you have already tried it... You are addicted. This is probably the BEST place to have Laksa in town...
1
I was told it's one of the signatute dish in sg n my friend got a bad diarrea . I still prefer laksa in malaysia ! The real laksa taste
4
We love Laksa and come here just for that reason.. we were NOT disappointed. Its very basic, Hawker-style but delicious. Loved the Laksa we has and enjoyed the street experience. People worked fast and furious but very friendly.
4
would love to eat another bowl. took long time to find a resto serving it but twas probably worth the trip just to find it.
4
One thing I really wanted to try out in Singapore was their laksa. I asked my friend to take me to where she thought the best laksa was sold. I found myself sitting by the road in Katong while I dug in a great bowl of the seafood noodle soup. The dish is known to be spicy, but it sure tastes great. You may also want to try the rojak in the area and cap it off with a serving of cold lemonade
4
Jumped in a taxi and asked if he knew 328 Katong Laksa and he shook his head furiously! Yes! Best Laksa in city he said!! Must have laksa gravy with bread or rice! Arrived and ushered into aircon section and ordered - fast, friendly service with a suggested Nasi Lemak (coconut rice) on the side.. Delicious! Noodles chopped so easy to eat and rice yummy with fried fish to add extra saltiness! Would recommend! Surrounded by photos of "celebs" and even Gordon Ramsay! Worth the taxi ride over
3
Taste is average and price has increased. But the chilli still taste good. Seems like there are couple of franchise outlets, but I prefer to go to the original shop at Katong is still the better.
5
The laksa here is fabulous as is the oota. It's no frills dining on plastic chairs and folding card tables, but for S$5, you cant beat it. try to fresh lime juice with your order.
5
Okay I'm biased! Call me old school but this is probably the best laksa in Singapore!! The noodles are cooked to al-dente. The entire dish is made up of ingredients that complement each other perfectly.
4
Tried a few stalls along Katong and my preferred version is 328 for the thicker soup base.
Chilli can be added according to your preference.
5
katong laksa 328 in the corner of ceylon rd and east coast rd is selling the best laksa in Singapore.the nyonya soup is a perfect combination of flavours and textures,smells and tastes: the rich remphe made of dried shrimps,firey chilli,galangal,tumeric and more ,and than mixed with rich coconut milk,laksa al dante moodles,fresh prawns and crispy beansporut and finaly the twist of the laksa leaf...yammiWok'n'Stroll highly recomended soup is katong laksa and its one of the best parts of our culinary adventure at katong and joo chiat area
5
Whenever I visit Singapore, I will try to have at least a bowl of authentic Nyonya Laksa Lemak. This Katong Laksa is one of the "must" try place if you want to have a bowl of excellent and yummylicious laksa. It comes in a variety of portion size and you can also add the cockles, fish cakes, prawns, etc. I simply love the tasty and spicy coconut laksa broth and the chilli paste that goes with the laksa. The feeling of having a hot bowl of laksa with the humidity of tropical weather always bring back the good memories of my good ole days in Singapore :-
5
May be "49 Katong Laksa" was the best Katong Laksa I've tried. Unfortunately, it looks like they closed down the operation for good. Personally I prefer 49 Katong laksa over 328.There are other noteworthy places selling Katong Laksa that's same or closer tasting to 49 Katong Laksa:* Roxy Square (Behind Grand Mercure Roxy hotel).* Marine Parade Food Centre* Ali Baba eating hous

When I think of laksa, I think of rich, lemak (coconut)-based soup, with thick rice noodles, and topped with a sprinkling of chopped green laksa leaves.328's Katong Laksa has really been the bomb - the thick soup was packed with enough flavor, and their chopped noodles made it easier to eat with a spoon, so you scoop up enough laksa soup and noodles when you eat. I like that this stall has prawns, fish cake, and some hum (blood cockles) to add more flavor to the meal. But the best has got to be the chopped laksa leaves they add to the noodles - simply the best

Lonely Planet recommended this lunch place - 328 Katong Laksa. This was the first laksa I ever had and it was great. I made one mistake; I forgot to order some "otah-otah" (spiced mackerel cake grilled in banana leaf). Suggest you do that next time. Can be reached by bus,, but taking a taxi from a Metro station is probably the easiest thing to do. Note that is not a real restaurant, but a place, where locals enjoy a nice meal. Yes, the price was very reasonable

Katong Laksa is a local delight in Singapore that consists of white noodles in a tasty broth of coconut milk, chilli, shrimps and etc. There are usually cockles served in laksa so you do have to inform them if you are not a fan of cockles. A must try local delight. The right stall to visit in Katong area is 328 Katong Laksa. They have another stall along the very same road at unit no. 51

Rich, cheap & hearty. Always consistent & easy to eat with the cut noodles.
Usually my Saturday lunchtime treat. Enjoy!

i used to frequent the place very often before i had kids. Now its just once in a blue moon. The shop locations pose parkign challenges especially during weekends. Not very child friendly. Not an issue if you choose to takeaway.
5
There are so many Katong Laksa stalls, you have to find the authentic one! I like the one round the corner, complete with Otahs.
5
The fragrant aroma, creamy gravy with all the right spices... every spoonful is so heavenly yummmy.. Skip it if you're on diet.
I would put this as one of the top To Eat list before I die.. hahahahha...

You need to try a few laksa's when in Singapore - they taste similar and yet different everywhere. One of the best is Katong Laksa although my favorite is the Laksa at eastcoastpark foodcourt!

whenever I feel like having laksa and am lazy to cook, Katong laksa is a great alternative for the family

I love a good laksa, and being in Singapore I thought it would be opportune to try out the real thing (yes I know the folks in Penang would argue differently but anyways...)First, there seems to be several choices in Katong who all claim to be The Original Katong Laksa. I picked one at random and ordered up a big bowl.Place was pretty divey but is was cheap and people were friendly, so in I dived. I managed about 3 mouthfulls before giving up: nothing like I was expecting, very strong fishy taste and kind of gross to my western palate. Not for me :

There seems to be a lot of confusion about the exact name and location of this restaurant. But this is were I had my dinner on my first night in Singapore. Within short walking distance of the Grand Mercure Roxy, one doesn't go there for the cosy setting. There is a choice between sitting on the damp pavewalk and trying to bear the neon lights and too cold airco of a not so clean dinner room. But the dish with the same name as the resaurant is excellent value for money. Add a bottle of cool Tiger beer. All in for less than 10$

Katong laksa is so yummy delicious i wish i had stomach for another bowl. the noodle is blanched several times with the laksa gravy so that when you eat it, it does not taste bland but is soaked with the laksa taste. the gravy is very very delicious. i finished mine completely.

Claiming to be the original "Katong Laksa", 328 Katong laksa occupies one and a half shophouses along East Coast Road. I like it that one of the shophouses is nicely air conditioned. It sure helps to beat the tropical heat. Ordered a laksa without cockles. It came in a big bowl and just a soup spoon. No chopsticks. Added a teaspoon of chilli paste and the booth is perfect. It is rich, fragrant and flavorful. Peppered with shreds of laksa leaves. There were shrimps and shreds of fishcakes. Shrimps were reasonably fresh. Though not the best laksa I had in Singapore, it's worth a try!
5
a local dish that any tourist must try! A little spicy, so not right for children.
4
If you like Laksa the this place is a must do in Singapore.
Has won lots of local awards and deservedly so. Excellent value for money.
Cash only no cards accepted (So cheep you don't need them anyway)
3
you'd never know which is the original katong laksa these days. but if you find and see one, try it, it should taste relatively ok for most first timers.
3
The laksa tasted bland and was just mostly coconut milk. It lacked the herbs and other condiments that make up a good laksa. If you are looking for a good bowl of katong laksa, go to Queensway mall instead.
4
Katong Laksa's lay out may not be that appealing to the eye for a place to have a meal for travellers and I say what the hack? Go on try the Laksa noodles here anyway, and you will understand the true Singapore taste. Prices here are reasonable and the fine tasting laksa here cannot be found anywhere else in the world or for that matter not even anywhere else in Singapore. Period
5
For those of you wondering what laksa is, its just a variety of herbs that made up this wonderful gift from heaven! Katong Laksa uses its special cooking methods which brings out the condense taste of the soup. the rice nooldes are cut up into little pieces which absorbs the flavours from the soup. Remember, the locals eat with only spoon. so dont ask for chopsticks! ^

Have always loved the laksa here, and I have been visiting the stall for more than 10 years. Glad to say the standard has not changed, and the food still comes as fast. Tip: Put lots of chilli for the extra punch if you can take the spiciness
4
i got to know Katong Laksa after my Singaporean friend took me there and told me it was the best laksa in town. I fell in love with the taste from that very first moment. I love when they add seafood in my laksa, makes it even better. I would make a small change though- give me a little less noodles and more of your yummy broth!!!I kept coming back a few times and took my friends there too.Place doesn't look cleanest, but hygiene level B is still ok
5
as i got the tip from a taxi driver on the best laksa, u could see around the kiosk famous celebrity photo and award given to this laksa place. one this for sure stand the test of time. just love this kinda place although ice tea is actually milk tea in this place but what the heck? makes me feel like a Singaporean. they also sold rujak, and nasi lemak in this place. too bad is kinda hard to find taxi here. i normally only comment on the best place to eat so is excellent all the way
4
Katong Laksa has been around for a while, and surprisingly, hasn't lost it's flavour or taste due to time or customer spend. I live on the other side of the island, so I try to make it as often as I can for my laksa fix
5
You'll never know which store is the original Katong Laksa.
The gravy (without mixing the chilli in) is a godsend for those who can't take much spice.
A must have if you are a tourist on a food hunt in the joo chiat area.
5
Don't miss it; most authentic laksa in town! Spicy, fragrant...i Dream of this laksa
4
Great experience, order a beer and the laksa by the street side. They will not give you chop sticks as they want you to eat the sauce along with the noodles. Yummy

YUm YuM :-)

Great food

You would want another bowl.

Seriously, I have no idea what the big fuss about this curry, the ingredients are much less than standard curry and you only have the choice of thick rice noodle. I would consider the dish itself over rating, I have tasted better laksa at a hawker centre at Circuit road.What made it worse is that there are actually 3 stalls at Katong serving the same dish, each claiming to be the original, and they are not in good terms with each other to the extend that Makansutra has to go on TV to try resolving the deadknot.The dish is not as good as it is marketed.I would give this dish a miss if I were you.

This place comes highly recommended, and lived up to it's reputation for good value, tasty laksa. Perfect for a cheap meal out in Singapore, if you are happy sitting in a street-style restaurant/canteen-style seating, enjoying authentic local food. Resonably priced beers too, and it was fairly quiet when I visited (a Friday night), maybe it's harder to get a table at lunchtime when Singaporeans are on their 1.5hr lunch break... Definitely worth a visit
5
Enjoyed our quick lunch here, the food was great (there is only one item on the menu, but available in 3 sizes with our without cockles). Noone in our family dared eat the cockles. They are just renovating so we ate in the new dining room. Its nothing fancy but clean airy and light. service quick and efficient, and of course great value for money. We ate at 2pm, so it was pretty quiet
4
Basic menu - laksa: small, medium or large... only variant is with or without cockles. The only other item they serve is oteh, the fish cake grilled in a banana leaf (delicious). Highly recommended if you are in the area, but wouldn't necessarily make a special trip out there from town just for a bowl of soup... But if you're near and are feeling peckish - the laksa was delicious
4
Must try, if only to eat laksa from a spoon

Good quality laksa

Katong Laksa has become a weekly staple after church

Gravy is ok, but serve with a spoon, does not work for me.
