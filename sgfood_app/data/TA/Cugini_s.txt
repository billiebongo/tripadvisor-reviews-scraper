Theyre open on Mondays! after work. Had a huge serving of the grilled chicken “polleto” and cheese and ham platter. Their complimentary bread selection is fresh as always. And still the only and best bottarga in Singapore. Special dessert ricotta mousse is good too.
5
Here for the weekend. Always love this restaurant thtas looks very Italian and Mediterranean. Also, the suckling piglet and steak are perfectly made. Good wine selection. Still Surprisingly cheap for the good quality of food and being busy.

Had a little dinner here. Somewhat expensive but, yeah, that's Singapore. The food and service are good.
5
Visited twice, for pizza, pasta and risotto. Very nice food, highly recommended. PS: Try the white chocolate panna cotta. Only negative remark: its too small!
5
Very Good Italian Food, if not The best in Spore, for its price. The ambience is very cozy and mediterranean. We started with a large serving of fresh burrata cheese. Really good. Then ravioli for mains and sharing as suggested. IT IS THEEEE BEST! Flavorful! We also had pizza and homemade gelato. We will definitely comeback for the ravioli!

If you like Italian food, with more than a hint of Italian feel about the place, then Cugini is somewhere to head for. In the middle of Club Street, it's the perfect location to experience the hustle and bustle of Singapore's bar and restaurant scene. The white and blue decor also adds a nod to the Mediterranean, with only the crystal blue waters missing as you sit outside on the deck whilst you sample a wide variety of Italian dishes. Service is excellent, which is by no means a given in these parts, and prices are on the sensible not silly side. Good selection of wines too if you happen to be eating on a company expense account

This certainly seemed the most popular restaurant in Club St for a Sunday night so we went in as it was a nice atmosphere. Food was ok, but small portions and really expensive for what it was. Calamari was slightly on the rubbery side but bruschetta was delicious. Pasta was al dente and again small, expensive portions. Staff are attentive at start and friendly, but as the restaurant got busier it was a bit of an effort to grab their attention. If you are happy pay high prices for Italian then go for it but it's unlikely we would return here
4
On a steamy tropical Sunday night, when many restaurants and bars are closed, Cugini was open on Club St doing a decent trade.We chose it for something light and Italian in the tropics.Our shared antipasto selection was very tasty.My friend enjoyed spaghetti Bottago while my Insalata Caesar was fresh and salty with excellent Parmigiano-Reggiano was delightful.A glass of chilled Rose did the trick!A lovely light Italian dinner in the tropics
4
We were looking for open restaurant around CBD and ended up at Club street.. luckily this resto was open and it was just amazing! We had the antipesto (cold cuts, grilled veggies N parmesan) and the Diavolla pizza. We ended the meals with the Pistachio and Chocholat gelatto.. Everything was so yummy.. quiet fast as well even there were also some table with guests. will defo come back again
4
After loading up on happy hour wine and fries my friend and I needed some food. We ended up at this place. My friendâ€™s pasta was good. I took the Parma ham and melon which tasted great, but as long as good ingredients that one is easy to do :)Service was good and they were very friendly.
5
It's a lovely place, characterful and attention to details. We had the Spaghetto Bottarga (mullet roe, prawns, olive oil, garlic, chili) which was delicious! Great service, ambient and music in the background - highly recommended!
5
My wife and I came on a weekday night and the place wasn't busy. I ordered the seafood risotto and it was excellent. The seafood was fresh and flavours were good. My wife had pizza, thin and crispy. Nice!

We were back to exploring Ann Siang and Club St on a Sunday evening after our last outing to this area on National Day 2017 where we tried the food at Jerry's BBQ.Parking was not a problem on Sunday as there were many lots available but we still needed to tear parking coupons as there is no free parking even on Sunday evening/nights.The inital idea was to try out another eating place but the family saw Cugini and walked over to take a look at the menu - and they decided to give this place a try instead. The restaurant served us 2 platter of bread and biscuits with their home made dips (tomato, cheese, onion, and a few more ingredients) it tasted good. Alternative dip would be olive oil. They serve ice water (FOC) which is good, Many italian restaurants only bottled still or sparkling which is expensive and also charge for tap water.We order calamari, a pizza, a vongole pasta (spaghetti) plus 2 mains meats - (1) 300 grams of corn fed steak (sliced nicely into 5 pieces and done "medium" plus some vegetables and potato fries. (2) spring chicken grilled in italian seasoning and rosemary plus mashed potato and vegetables. Everything worked out just fine for the 5 of us. For me, if given a choice, I would pass on the pizza and just focus on the pasta and the meat mains Still, it was nice meal overall. We did not try any desserts as we had a very full meal. Maybe next time when we come back again we'll try the tiramisu. The service staff was friendly and patient with us. It was a Caucasian lady who took care of us throughout. During the course of dinner, we saw many more guest stream even when it is was after 8pm...its quite a popular place and majority of the guest were Caucasians too. Us local Singaporean Chinese were the minority

We stumbled upon Club Street on our final night in Singapore. It was a Sunday evening and as such, many restaurants and bars were closed. Cuginis however was open for business. We really enjoyed the beautifully prepared food especially the Bruschetta which although a simple starter was delicious. The food, wine and the balsamic vinegar of great quality. We are just disappointed we didn't get the chance to visit Club Street on a busy night- it has a different feel to China town and has a diverse range of bars and eateries. Recommend to the Brit tourists.
3
Well, I know Singapore is an expensive city especially on entertainment and fine dining side but here the bill impressed me....I didn't eat too much, just a mix of appetizers, cold cuts and some wine and I spent more than 100 SGD. If you think is normal there is some problem....Nothing to say on food quality but at the end of the day I think that what I got didn't worth that amount.It is a pity, of course a restaurant must survive and pay the rent but a good restaurant should be remembered more for his taste than for his bill
4
Our last family dinner in Singapore after staying 10 nights was at Cugini Trattoria and Pizzeria, and it was a lovely dinner that we all enjoyed. My husband, myself and our two teenage sons stayed 2 nights at the nearby The Club Hotel and we were craving familiar non-spicy food. Cugini is located at 87 Club Street, a narrow street filled with restaurants and bars. There are a few tables outside but we chose to dine inside in air conditioned comfort. We loved the white and sea blue decor, it felt very comfortable and relaxing. We really enjoyed our meals - authentic Italian pizzas, handmade Truffle & potato Ravioli, and Squid Fettucini. We couldn't resist dessert - two Panna Cottas and a Chocolate Lava dessert. Service was quietly efficient. Whilst not a cheap dinner out, we thoroughly enjoyed it and I would most definitely recommend Cugini for a memorable Italian meal
4
Took 10 work colleagues here and we had a great evening. This is a simple authentic Italian restaurant, nice friendly staff and an approachable appealing menu, full of lots of dishes you actually would enjoy eating. The pizza is terrific. A word of warning: the food is delicious and reasonable, but the wine is diabolically expensiv

Well, that wasn't pleasant. You know, I sometimes look at back at my Tripadvisor reviews and think I err too much on the side of caution when reviewing restaurants, but this place has allowed me to be very candid. I eat in a lot of places in the world, from Tokyo to Dhaka, to Buenos Aires to Bologna, and can comfortably say the pasta I had tonight was the worst I've had for some time, and definitely the worst in a restaurant ever. It was a chunk - my daughters would say a 'chod' - of solid, sickly-looking, flavourless gloop. It was spaghetti carbonara in an Italian restaurant for goodness' sake, surely that should be a dish they can get right? It didn't even have the offsetting benefit of being cheap. The wine is significantly overpriced too, with the staff just a little bit too keen on topping up our glasses with the aim, it felt, of foisting another bottle on us. Avoid avoid avoid.
1
Urgh! Handmade fetuccini that tasted like cardboard. And served the colder side of lukewarm. No excuse!! I was the only patron in the entire place. No fault of the wait staff, who were attentive and very pleasant. The only other saving grace, the white wine was good.Note to chef: It would be good to have your pastas served warm and relook at making sure al dente does not equate to the consistency of cardboard.
5
Had a lovely dinner with my girlfriends on a friday night. Felt like we were transported to Santorini or something. What amaze me is the evening dinner service. Love the pizza and will remember to come back for more.
4
Found this little gem with a colleague looking for quaint relaxation and vegetarian cuisine options. Lovely, unhurried service and an excellent meal.
4
The highlight of my experience here is the unique taste of the Vongole. Best i've had in Singapore, where a lot of restaurants do an average job with the dish. The clams are already lifted out of the shells, so it saves you the hassle of peeling them out yourself. This doesn't compromise on the flavour. While i was happy with my dish though, my friends weren't as delighted. They've commented that the pizzas were very average and while the truffle Ravioli was delicious, the serving portion was too small to be filling
4
Cugini has a wide and varied menu of both classics and slightly unusual dishes. An antipasto starter for 2 was generous and offered a few different types of ham and salami, olives and roasted vegetables, and all were good. The pizzas are very good, as evidence by the half-eaten diavola in the attached photograph... Light, tasty bases, tomato sauce that has just the right amount of salt and herb content, and toppings that are generous and also of high quality.The wine list is extensive, covering most Italian regions, and also includes some new world selections.Bill came to just under $110 per person, and was reasonable value, given the quality of the food. Service is attentive and unassuming, as well as friendly.Cugini is definitely worth a visit
4
Went here on a Thursday. Club Street was very busy but this place was not too crowded. Enough people to have atmosphere, but not heaving like a lot of places. Has a couple of tables outside, and a nice bright interior. Rustic furniture - blue and white, almost like Provence (although this is an Italian). I had a pizza, which seemed to have been fire cooked and was tasty. Just a couple of types of beer, but a reasonable wine list. I'd say this place is fairly low key - food is well cooked by not especially adventurous. Something to please everyone. Good place to go with a few friends or colleagues when you want to chat and be confident there's something on the menu everyone will like. Staff were friendly and service was quick. I was here on my own, reading a book. But I now remember we had a company dinner here once - about 20 people - and that went well too. Good service, not very expensive, everyone was happy
3
We had dinner with friends here on a weekend evening. The food was OK but without any real wow factor and portions were definitely on the small side. We experienced good service and there was a good selection on the menu for vegetarians. Reliable choice for Italian food while in Singapore
5
Looking for somewhere to dine on a Sunday in Singapore but without it involving a wok!Was surprised to find Club Street all but deserted but the great news was Cugini's was open and quiet.Went for a shared selection of Caesar Salad, Fried Calamari and Spaghetti Marinara and was mighty pleased with everything. The pickiest of people (and yes I have been known to be one) may have thought that the bacon was missing from the salad but then again some don't have it. I would have preferred a bit more anchovy in my dressing but again its a personal taste.The calamari was excellent, cooked to perfection with a light and crunchy batter and as for the marinara ... at last a restaurant that knows how to cook perfect pasta. Outstanding and the sauce was delicious. beware the chocolate lava and ice cream .its a beauty.Great staff, great food, great ambience a wonderful way to spend a couple of hours on a Sunda
4
Honestly, Singapore is bereft of good, authentic Italian pizza. There is a lot of misunderstanding here of what a pizza actually is. If you want American deep-pan nonsense, then either recalibrate your taste or look elsewhere.Cugini make beautifully-crusted Italian pizzas, the way they were supposed to be. We had a couple from the menu, and both were fabulous.Service is always attentive and fast, and cost is reasonable.I'll go back for yet another fantastic experience
4
I have a friend who loves food and swears that the carbonara here is the best in Singapore, if not the world. We opened with calamari, deepfried and crisp, along with the standard burrata on a bed of cherry tomatoes. Both staples were solid and well done. He went for the spaghetti for his main, I opted for the pizza rucola e parma, which was very tasty with a thin and light base, fluffy around the edges. Delicious.The decor is blue and white, evoking a sun drenched terrace in Capri, with both indoor and outdoor seating. We had a table under the skylight, which was the best of both worlds
3
The restaurant has a rather interesting setup with an Italian atmosphere. I would believe that the taste of the food would be the same. Well reality was a bit different. Rather average taste, small portions and very overpriced. The neighborhood is quite nice and worth walking around but i would not pick the same place again for dinner
4
Got there by chance (and hungry !!) and didn't regret it !! Tried pasta AND pizza and felt like in a real, local pizzeria/trattoria in Italy ! Very nice staff and of course as in Italy very family friendly !!
1
Food quality was ok, but the amount does not fill my 2-year old son. We ended up paying $77 for 5 ravioli pieces, 1 small plate of spaghetti and 1 Coke. Insane!
4
Located at Club street, at walking distance from China Town (which is actually very much overrated). Club street is a very nice street and Cugini's is a very friendly place with surprising good food (great truffle ravioli) and winelist.
3
If you really crave Italian food, that's the option on this street. But you have so much more choices...
4
Ok italian Food with a friendly service , a little on the expensive side but good.
We had Pizza and a tomato / Mozzarella salad . I do not think that they have Italian imported products but still good.
5
Came highly recommend by a friend. Was not disappointed at all.Made the booking online. Had a great table when we arrived, but we opted to eat on the street. Made for some super people watching as it is located in a very popular street with restaurants and bars.Service was extremely prompt and friendly, and the food equaled the service.Would definitely return
1
Went to Cugini's with five colleagues. Drinks arrived fairly quickly, but the food took awhile to come, and my order of a Pacchero Pesto Genovese did not arrive at all. We informed the wait staff twice (one of whom looked like possibly the manager), but all we were told was that they will check on it. By the time I was informed that the dish was being prepared, the rest of my colleagues had already finished their meals, so I told the waiter/manager to cancel the order. No apology or service recovery was made and they still attempted to include the dish on our bill. A pretty disappointing level of service for a seemingly established restaurant.
1
We were here in a group of 6 this evening & ordered pretty standard pizzas, pastas and a risotto. My partner's pesto pasta never arrived, and it took us several attempts to wave a wait staff down, who said she'd check but never came back to us. Second time we flagged down who I presume to be the floor manager (I wouldn't know for sure, as he didn't carry himself the way I imagine customer-centric restaurant managers would). He very unapologetically said he'd check, and 15 mins later came back to say the pasta was being prepared but by then we had all finished (I think our colleagues very kindly ate at a slower pace than usual) and decided to cancel the order. Said manager was fairly quick to collect the bill though, and came across unapologetic and uninterested in retaining any of his restaurant's reputation when we gave him some polite feedback about the disappointing service we received all night.To be fair the potato truffle ravioli I had was delicious. But I would never dine at a place that has no "heart" for their customers, no matter how good the food. I'd save the money spent for somewhere else
3
Went there with friends Sat night. Location is amazing and tables outside are on the street.Inside ambience is not as cool. Food was good and service was professional and nice. Price too high and value for money is not fair.Bottom line no one thing I can point at, still overall it was only OK.

I was staying in Singapore for the weekend in the CBD, on the edge of Far East Square. I now know that the very many restaurants there don't open on Sundays. I wandered around looking for a place to eat a late lunch. I had spent over a week on business in Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore and, while I love Asian food, I needed a European break. I was walking down Club Street looking for some specific restaurants based on a TripAdvisor search. The ones in question were closed but I came upon what appeared to be a very appealing Italian - Cugini - with nice tables outside. Being from Ireland, eating outside is a novelty and essential when the weather allows. There was another couple sitting outside but nobody inside. I was told that they closed in 20 min at 4pm but they were fine about me sitting at the outside table past that. They said the only option was pizza which was fine by me. I ordered a Crudo E Rucola at $27.90 plus GST and 10% service charge - the most expensive pizza I ever had! I asked for garlic on it and that was no problem. I also ordered a glass of house Chianti. Then I got the internet password and checked them out. Not good! If I read the reviews earlier I would not have gone there. The reviews also indicated that the wine was good but expensive, which I now know to be true. I hadn't seen the price before I ordered it, though it was unlikely to stop me! ($17 per glass). Unlike many of the reviews I had no issue with service, maybe because at this stage I was the only customer. I really enjoyed my pizza and wine. So much so I felt the need to have another glass! I knew the staff were off duty so I went in with glass in hand. They were all eating their afternoon meal (Asian, not Italian!). After some banter about that the lady who appeared to be in charge served me without issue. After that I was allowed to take my time and at no point did I feel pressure to leave. The bill came to $73 (Singapore dollars) or â‚¬48 including GST and service, by far the most expensive pizza and two glasses of wine I ever had. However it would be naive to expect European prices for European cuisine In Singapore. I have to admit I really enjoyed it and would come back again. Both the pizza and the wine were top class.
4
Good location & atmosphere, attentive staff, and above average food, as are the prices. Would I go again? Yes.
3
Went there for pizza as we were passing by. Atmosphere is very welcoming and charming. Pizzas were ok only, nothing special for the high price ( close to 30 dollars). Will I ever go back: no as really nothing special!
4
A warm summer's night found myself and friend on Club St. One of the few restaurants open on a Sunday was Cugini's, a very laid back and chic Italian.We sat outside on the balcony watching the passing parade.We eat light - sharing an excellent antipasti plate and Caesar salad, spoiling ourselves with a warm, dark chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream - yummy!Service was friendly and attentive.The prices were very reasonable, thoroughly enjoyable evening
1
We had a dinner on sunday. We ordered one salad to share and one pasta each. We waited over an hour for pasta, when we checked one of waitress(guessing supervisor or someone who in-charge) i told her we're waiting for so long time and she just ignored and passed by. Taste was terrible too, the pasta was line a rubber band and some more It was not a reasonable price too, it was just terrible meal ever in singapore
5
This was our default Italian restaurant and we came here every time we craved some comfort food! I personally loved their house red - a Chianti - as well as their pizzas, pastas and starters. Never really got around to trying their mains. If you come on a weekend - either Friday or Saturday - reservations would be advisable, as club street closes off traffic and all the restaurants spill out on the road, and it becomes a party street. This is one of the few Italian restaurants that stays open till 10pm (last orders for food) most days - which is a godsend in Singapore!My personal favourites were the bread basket with the dipping sauce, Burrata Pugliese (please note it is a fairly substantial portion), the 4 cheese and Pepperoni pizzas, the mushroom risotto and the tiramisu
3
The restaurant has a lovely feel at the outside tables with blue and white chairs. We sat 5 minutes before opening time and the staff refused to serve us. When we did get service we had some delicious bread, a pizza and the lobster and apple risotto - interesting but not a lot of lobster. An easy meal after work but I probably wouldn't come bac
3
Came here to celebrate family member's birthday. We ordered mozzarella, vegetarian pizza and linguine vongole. Mozzarella - stingy on basil and tomatoes, in fact, no basil at all though it says basil on the menu. Pizza - was good size for 2 pax, fresh and authentic dough, love the crust. Vongole - tiny portion with very little clams, but perfectly al dente (like this very much), a little too salty. Surprise birthday song was nice, they turned off the lights and put on the birthday song, though the staff team didn't look too enthusiastic about it. Wines were $16/glass. Relatively good selection of Italian wines. Nevertheless, it's a chill hangout dinner spot before pub-hopping the street
4
Ordered black angus beef that's absolutely delicious. My friend helped to order red wine for all of us that's also perfectly compliment my meal.However, the serving of main meals took quite a while. Maybe because there were 8 of us. The owners (I assume) and the lady who waited our table were very friendly, though can use more smiles.Price is slightly above average, but it's worth it, to my opinion. All in all, nice homey place for dinner with colleagues
1
I was forced to go there again as I was invited. But I was still hopeful for a better experience a couple of years after my last one. After all, they must've improved to stay open that long, you would think? Wrong! This place is terrible! Horrible food and horrible service. A cool location is not an excuse for such a terrible restaurant.
5
We went to Club Street on Friday night around 10pm... it was busy. reminded me of a 'high class' lan kai fong. I didnt get the name but the Italian restaurant manager was helping us to get the seat. We enjoyed the pizza and risotto. Nice. Good choice to dine in if you are planning to spend ur evening at Club Street. Compared to other restaurants that area, I will go for this one! Will I go back? Definitely!
4
I go there for their fried calamari and burrata! A pure delight!
Their pizzas are not the best you will try in Singapore, but they are decent.
Service is good, the staff is kind and attentive.
3
It was Ok, if not a little expensive, but enjoyable food. A glass of wine was small and very expensive.
Nice surroundings. Service was OK, but felt a bit rushed, despite the restaurant being nearly empty.
4
Landed there by coincidence last night. The atmosphere brought back so many Italian memories! Family owned and run, kitchen smell in the main room, decoration a bit outdated etc... Service was friendly and we found the food very tasty and authentic.

We are regular guests of this Italian restaurant in Club Street.Our last visit was on a Saturday night, when the street is closed to traffic and most of the crowd dines at tables scattered all around the road itself.I believe they deserve a quick review for their Chef’s Specials. They are usually on the inner cover of the menu, but, in case you missed them, always pointed out by their staff.We had a fantastic “Bolognese” with home-made tagliatelle. The sauce was like we tasted in Italy: thick tomato, generous mix of minced pork and beef and plenty of Parmesan cheese.This time, the other special was a very yummy beef fillet (I think it was Black Angus from Australia, but not sure): it came with a creamy sauce of Gorgonzola (an Italian blue cheese), which matched perfectly with the grilled stake.Bravo

We were visiting Singapore from Tokyo. Spent a few days around the most popular attractions.On our last day, we were for the whole afternoon in Chinatown.Just one block away, almost by chance, we found Club Street: a nice, picturesque neighborhood with a line of shop-houses, plenty of bars and restaurants.We have been attracted by the white-and-blue décor of this place: it looks like a family-run restaurant from the south of Italy.We had a very entertaining evening with great food and good wine: the menu is quite extensive and seems to cover most to the traditional Italian dishes: antipasto misto, calamari, bruschetta, many pastas to choose from and four different ravioli. The manager pointed out that all of them are home-made. Plus, very yummy mixed grill dishes (we tried the meat one and it was a very generous portion for two people). Desserts are delicious as well: tiramisu, panna cotta and torta di cioccolato.Also, quite a good selection of wines, mainly from Tuscany. It seems they import directly from Italy most of their labels, so, for the usually expensive prices of wines in Singapore, we found quite good value for money.The service was casual, but very friendly, both from the manager and the girls.The place seems to be popular with both locals and expats as it was quite full even on a Tuesday night.Overall, a very nice ending to our holiday. :)

We were a group of six friends, after a very hot afternoon playing football. We were in need of plenty of carbohydrates (and beers) to regain some energy.Was a very busy night on Friday, as it always seems to be the case recently in Club street.We had in total eight pizzas, six different pasta and 3 ravioli. Couldn't count how many Peroni bottles...All really excellent. Congrats to the Chef.In particular, Penne Amatriciana was very succulent, like they do it in Rome. And truffle ravioli was very delicate and yummy.Pizzas were very tasty, thin and crunchy crust. My favorite was the "bufala", with fresh chunks of Buffalo mozzarella, fresh after the pizza ends baking in the oven. The place was full, all service staff was running like crazy, but, at the end, our table was attended in a very friendly way.Not cheap, but this place surely does not compromise on quality
1
We are not sure if the food is any good because we walked out after an hour. The staff were rude and neglected us. Such a shame, the venue is good. The staff regularly claimed they were "busy". They weren't. We could see 5 empty tables and the big tables weren't overly full. The staff were just rude and incompetent. It was also obvious they were used to complaints. They were not surprised when we walked out after waiting over an hour for our meals. Avoid and go anywhere else
4
We found this Italian Trattoria more by coincidence on a Sunday evening as one of the only restaurants open in Club Str. The choice of food was good. Very good super fresh burrata and excellent carpaccio. we had pasta and pizza and all was very tasty and came timely served. Good choice of wine. bit pricy, but most probably average for Club street
2
First off, i find all the dishes a bit too pricey especially for the quality of dishes served. I genuinely believe I make better pasta than them. The servings were small and none of the dishes ordered were memorable. Ordered a squid ink pasta, a seafood risotto, a seafood marinara, 2 miso fritto, a mozzarella, a chocolate soufflé that looks more like a lava cake than soufflé, one bottle of sparkling wine & 1 bottle of red wine. All the food items weren't impressive but the chilean red wine was good though. Service was not that great, being server was not too happy to explain when we asked why the soufflé looks like a lava cake. Anyways, not worth visiting. Will not return for sure
4
Great for veggies and meat lovers alike. Love the desserts - the chocolate lava cake and the Sicilian pastries are beautiful. Good pasta, I have never had a bad meal here. Authentic, delicious.
3
Completely average. Service was attentive but not warm and friendly. Food was mediocre and the pasta portions are small. Overpriced and don't forget to add on the service charge (what service) and GsT.
2
it's not the first time I've been to this place. I've been here many months before and was greatly impressed by the quality and authenticity of Italian food. on recent visits, the pasta is still done al dente, exactly the way I like it to be; but don't bet on the portion size as it has shrunk terribly and their ingredients are just lacking or just missing from the plate. for the price you way, you should be expecting a lot more. service has always been bad.there are better and more authentic Italian places in singapore, at way better prices. might just want to give this place a miss in future
2
the day I was there the service was bad, they were not able to manage the food - we went there to eat together by the time my girlfriend finished her pasta my pizza wasn't ready yet (and she eat very slow!!) As for the food: The pasta was ok but the pizza was a total fail - not authentic at all. Not sure if it was only a bad day but sure I'll never go back
3
We had pizzas and 1 bottle of wine plus water, shared desert. Total was approx 40€ each but my pizza was quite overcooked so that the lateral crust was not edible as black and too hard. The desert is ridicoulous as for approx 9€ you get a superminimal desert which will never satisfy your idea. Don't buy it. My friend pizza was ok. The wine at 40€ entry level was good. Atmosphere and staff nice
3
We were staying close by and looking for a lunch spot.The restaurant was nice and cool and the staff were very attentive, a little too quick to remove plates and cutlery. We ordered bruschetta which half had pesto. The pizza we ordered seemed to take a long time. It was thin crust and tasty. Lots of locals for a mid week, obviously a popular spo
1
Just don't go! U have to wait 1 hour for your meal and it's not even to the standard! Expensive meal and sucks! All sucks! Pasta was cold and cheated in clams! ordered clams pasta and believe me I picked out 20 empty shells out of my plate of cold pasta. Price wise do expensive really not worthy. Not all but I must say one particular one is do rude! Hello,,, we are not eating for free here We are actually paying and plus 17% on top of price list as well! Never ever are we going to go there again.
4
I went to Cugini for dinner with my Dad and my husband, all three of us LOVED it. We started with a pizza to share. Before it arrived I was worried because I wasn't that hungry. As soon as I took one bite, I was hooked! The pizza based was light and cooked perfectly with the right amount of toppings on it. All three of us had pasta for our main, my husband and I each had a ravioli dish and my dad had spaghetti. The pasta is all made in-house (as I suspect the pizza dough was too). My ravioli was melt-in-the-mouth perfect. It was cooked absolutely perfectly, the whole 'to the tooth' thing. I had to really slow myself down from eating it too quick. It was rich, creamy but still light. We each had a dessert too, the boys had ice cream and I had a semi-freddo. It was lovely! The staff are attentive, polite and helpful. The food is very delicious and cooked so well with lots of flavour. I would definitely go back and would recommend it to my family and friends
3
We have enjoyed their pizzas for a while now ... always ordering as a take away. Recently, we decided to try the restaurant itself. Although the pizzas were as good as ever, the service leaves a great deal to be desired.Do yourself a favour and order take away

First the good news: .The pizzas although expensive are well made and taste authentic.At lunchtime it seems there is more attention paid to decorating,folding napkins or haulin sacks of stuff around the place.Customers seem to be a nuisance and are treated as such.The wine list proved inaccurate with wrong vintages brazenly offered.Pizzas ok at25 dollars each!I wonder what they open at all at lunchtime

Avendo mangiato solo la pizza non posso giudicare il resto (per il momento) ma posso affermare con decisione che era ottima. I proprietari sono italiani e tutti i prodotti sono autentici. Diffidare dai commenti negativi, anche il servizio era ottimo.Ottimo anche il tiramisú, faremo decisamente altre visite a Cugini per provare anche il resto.-----I truly do not understand the negative reviews, the food is authentic italian, the pizza was great and the tiramisú delicious. The service of the owners was perfect, and the locals were a little slow but nothing different from any other place in singapore. This is how italian food tastes like, and I liked it because it tastes "like home". I will definitely go back and try all the other dishes too

This was my first experience eating in an authentic Italian pizzeria and I loved it. Located on the chic Ann Siang hill's Club Street, this joint has an elegant, lively ambience. The staff were gracious enough to allow me to watch the Italian chefs at work and even allowed me to take pictures. The vegetarian pizzas and lasagna we ordered were delicious. They also have an excellent wine collection. The restaurant is a little bit on the pricier side but all in all good value for money

Having been here for dinner a few times, it was rather surprising to read about the negative experiences by our fellow reviewers here on TripAdvisor. Personally, I have no problems with the place and do return from time to time for dinner.Nestled in the cosy corner of Club Street, it is a rather nice place to be having dinner at. The restaurant is very much decorated as with most Italian restaurants, making it a point for me to ‘rove’ my eyes around the place when I come here. Food was generally good for me too, reason why I return for dinner.Service was ok, although when the place is full, the servers may appear a little overwhelmed. It may be good to call for reservations beforehand

Really good authentic pasta. Asian tastes probably prefer it softer, but the al dente style is much more authenticReally recommend the Beef Ravioli, but the serving size is small.Pizzas are pretty good. Lasagna is vegetarian which is a shame!Nice authentic atmosphere, relaxed, not at all stuffy, but also not too loud. Good jumping off point if you want somewhere at Club StCan sit outside on Friday and Saturday nights no

The location in Singapore's lively Club Street near Chinatown is great, the decor of the restaurant lovely and the pizza really good. It is not cheap, but given the location that is to be expected. The problem of this restaurant is...their service. In general the staff does not come across as friendly or service-oriented. Hardly any smiles. If you are coming with a big group and you want to pay separately, this seems to be a problem. This place could be great if the service was better. Would I go back? Probably not. There are better options for Italian restaurants in Singapore

First time I've ever given a bad review on Trip Advisor, but I want to warn people away from this place.Went on a busy Friday night. Location is great, but that's about the only thing that was. Went with 4 other people. None of us are complainers in general but we were literally infuriated and all of us complained to the staff.1. Overpriced, tiny portionsPortions are ridiculously small and expensive (except pizza). My friends who ordered ravioli with meat sauce were served 5 raviolis each, for something like 25 $ per plate. My friend who ordered linguine with seafood received a tiny portion with literally just 2 shrimpy shrimps. Appetizer salad of prosciutto and roquette with fried dough was pretty meager as well.2. Mediocre foodAlthough my eggplant pizza was good, none of my friends liked their pastas, particularly my two friends who ordered ravioli with meat sauce because they were stone cold in the middle. In fact, one of them got up and brought her plate back to kitchen saying she refused to pay for something so paltry and poorly made, and went home hungry.3. Awful serviceSingapore will never be known for good customer service, but this place takes the cake. We waited ages for our appetizer and then the meals arrived not even remotely at the same time. First was my friend's seafood linguine, which he finished by the time my pizza arrived. I was halfway done when the two raviolis with meat sauce arrived and we were all finished by the time my boyfriend's osso buco ravioli arrived. When we asked about the delay, the waiter argued with us, and at first didn't seem to remember taking my boyfriend's order. Then he said he had to check with the kitchen and made the excuse that it was a busy night. When we complained, the manager said he wouldn't charge us for my friend's dish that she returned uneaten and we would get a 15% discount for our trouble. The bill arrived without the ravioli removed and had to be fixed again. The staff apologized but we really weren't impressed. Interestingly, all around us we saw diners getting annoyed and one table got up and stormed out. At one point, I saw what I assume is the owner slam his fist down on the counter in anger at his staff. Geez! Get a handle on it buddy. And just so you know, in Canada (where I'm from) or the states or the UK (where my friends are from), if this kind of thing happened, the restaurant would do way more than a 15% discount to make amends. At the least, they'd offer everyone a free drink and dessert, but they'd probably comp the whole meal.Ugh, worst dining experience in Singapore so far

Last weekend, a large group of friends and I went to Cugini's to celebrate a girlfriend's birthday. We had a fantastic time! The staff was extremely helpful while we adjusted the reservation (about 100 times as people joined/unjoined the party). And the restaurant itself is super cute and super conveniently located on Club Street so it was easy for us to organize things before/after in the area. The best part for us was how attentive the staff was! They were excellent! And, in addition to that, the food was great.What was super sweet was that they allowed us to drop off a dessert before hand and kept it in the fridge for us. Then, when we requested it, they turned down the lights, brought out the dessert with candles (which I didn't even think to provide), and the whole staff came out to sing with us!Highly, highly recommend Cugini's

I'm writing this review having visited this establishment without having previously read any of the reviews on here which paint a picture of average food and poor service. We were taken by friends on a Saturday night at the busiest time (9.00pm) and had a storming pizza with drinks and coffees to finish. Cost us $175 per couple with food, 2 beers and bottles of prosecco and pinot noir. Pizzas were great, fresh, hot and the wait was fine for a homemade pizza. Service was attentive and not as previously recorded. Maybe they have a new waiting team ? Atmosphere was good and we will go again

When I studied in Melbourne, one of my favorite pasta is penne amatriciana. Was searching for years back in Kuala Lumpur and Singapore until I found Cugini's. So here is where I go to satisfy my craving. Love the vegetable soup as well. Whenever, I go back, I always order the same thing because this is so good (for me) that trying new things is just going downhill

I went to Cugini last Friday night. As always it was very busy and bit noisy. The perfect atmosphere for good and happy Friday night outing.The service was very polite and attentive. The food was just awesome. We had for starter Cugini pizza, buffalo mozzarella and antipasto misto to share. As main fetuccine al nero, spaghetti with mullet roe, truffle ravioli and lamb chop. We wait a bit long for the food to be served, especially for the main, but once the food arrived all of us were quite delighted.Thank you again to the Cugini team for yet another wonderful night

We had a pizza twice at Cugini's and second time we had a talk to owner, who is a nice person. Pizzas were fine, nothing to complain and service good. We did not touch wine (expensive here but anywhere in S'pore too) and we were ok with the meal.Prices are definitely on the high side however we noticed the place was quite busy, and people enjoying italian food.It is not an address I shall mark to return but in the expensive Singapore a reasonable place to go.By the way we had a late order while they were closing and they were kindly taking us in anyhow
1
Most of the food is relatively overpriced, compared with what you get. Don't get me started on how long you have to wait for the food.The service is pretty poor too, so much so that you can almost tell that they hate their jobs. Any enquires about the dishes is met with rude mutterings and frowns on their faces

A busy lively restaurant is always a good sign, or so we thought....My friends made a reservation for the three of us at 8.30pm on a Saturday night and we had a nice table just inside. We were served tap water whilst we waited and our order was taken fairly promptly. The waitress looked like someone had taken the jam right out of her doughnut that day. She was difficult to understand and seemed a bit irritated by the fact she had to repeat herself in a noisy restaurant. But we didn't let that bother us so far. We ordered the prosciutto di parma ham and some buffalo mozzarella. After 45 minutes nothing appeared and we asked the waitress to check our order had been put through. She glumly advised us that the kitchen was busy. We decided to try someone else who actually had some customer service skills and some efforts were made to rustle something up. It was starting to look a bit iffy. Anyhow the ironically titled "appetisers" arrived and looked a little like they had been thrown on the plate in a fit of pique. Three wafer thin slices of ham (luckily just the three of us then) and a bit of dry salad was a bit cheeky for $22. The mozzarella was a little better value for money with a token drizzle of balsamic and a wet mushy beef tomato.After finishing these - which took less than a minute, we waited for our mains. We had to clear and stack our own dishes when the mains arrived as no one cleared away our plates. We had been warned that my choice of risotto would take 20 minutes to prepare - ironic as that was the first main dish to arrive and was about an hour after we had ordered. It must have been a lean day down at the fish market that day as the pasta with 'fruits de la mer' was served with two small pieces of fish and a small shrimp, slightly blushing with embarrassment as he perched on top of the dish, alone.The pizza arrived last and was probably the best of the three - but what's to go wrong with a pizza?We complained at various points along the way but weren't really reassured by the responses we were given. The $230 bill for one bottle of wine, two starters and three mains was a bit stiff so my friend asked if they could 'take another look at the bill' considering we had waited so long for everything. We were getting absolutely nothing back and so she asked to see the manager. We knew of course that we were dealing with the manager already, but his complete lack of apology and ability to acknowledge that they had failed us was so evident, we needed to highlight that we felt there MUST be someone above him! In the end, 10% was deducted from the bill but it wasn't really about the money. It would have been much nicer to have someone come to our table and apologise, even tell us some B.S. but just to acknowledge they were letting us down and maybe offer to do something about it. That would have gone a long way. Amusingly (and we had to laugh by this point) the three guys at the next table all ate their main courses 20 minutes apart and as compensation were offered free desserts which they were then charged for! I came here as a tourist along with two friends who live in Singapore, very much looking forward to a great evening and we were all sadly disappointed. Worst of all they felt embarrassed for bringing me there. Fortunately we can look back and laugh about it and I actually had a great evening

I have to admit that It takes me a lot to get mad, however this place managed to push the buttons. With the distinct honour of being the worst restaurant we've been to since we moved to Singapore (since July 2012), this place truly sucks. The food was below average, the service was appalling and a manager who's defensiveness can only be interpreted as a sure fire sign that this happens regularly.Do yourself a favour, go to the numerous good Italian restaurants in Singapore and don't waste your time or money

Went out to dinner with some girlfriends. We asked to sit at the table outside and were told abruptly "reserved" . We were led inside and given menu's by a woman who looked as if she hated her job and didn't know how to smile. We were given iced water and waited for a while for someone to take our order. Eventually we asked the same person if we could order some wine and she grunted at us , not sure whether it was yes or no . She walked past us 4 times after that ...we decided that it was time to leave. They obviously didn't want us there so we went across the road to Da Paolo

I was invited by a group of ladies for lunch at this pretty in Blue, Trattoria on Club St. We were greeted by a very warm Italiano gentleman as we walked in to our table. This place was almost full for lunch, lucky enough our table was on reservation at 1pm. There were total of 7 of us. Only Michelle ( one of the ladies) had been here and told us that the food is excellent and freshly homemade.So we asked her what did she had the last time. She mentioned truffle ravioli, black ink pasta and parma ham pizza. The 7 of us ordered as starter 1) antipasto (serve for 2)- good selection of cold cuts, 2) burrata cheese (300grams) - fresh and portion is enough for us to share 3) 2 portion of caesar salad- comes with chunk slices of chicken breast meat, great size as a starter course.For our mains the ladies ordered the recommendation by Michelle and some others on the menu like penne amatricana ( tomato based with smoked bacon), risotto with mushrooms and for myself, Chef's special of the day- Beef steak with gorgonzola cheese sauce comes with side dish of my choice to which I chose grilled vegetables. The mains were satisfying , thanks to Michelle! My steak was cooked to perfection just the way I expected and the grilled vegetables were fresh, nicely marinated and grilled to perfect timing ( not soggy or overcooked). The homemade cheese sauce is tasty and it was also nice to dip in with bread!We also had a couple of Prosecco sparkling wine each to enjoy with our lunch. We skip the dessert. It is value for money for the great dining experience.We had a good time especially for us all mommies! Unfortunately, we had to leave by 3pm to pick up the kids :/ Definately coming back with my family! My 6 years old daughter loves pizza

My husband and I had two chicken Caesar salads and for the price there was not much at all.The chicken was sliced meat just as it had come from the supermarket packet and had no flavour.It was possibly one of the worst Caesar salads I have had in the five years I have lived in Singapore. We did not try any of the pizza or pasta dishes and probably would not give it a second go.The waitress who served us was not able to answer what would be in the chicken salad The only plus is the location on club street a nice place to have a drink in the evening

Went to Cugini's twice, and the reason i gave it a second shot was to see if my first impressions were simply wrong. However I managed to confirm impressions.The appearance of Cugini is that of an Italian trattoria, pretty casual dining and you go there to relax and have some good home cooking.We ordered a few dishes and overall this is not traditional italian cooking, it's very much adapted to local tastes, which would be fine, except the prices are similar to those of much better establishments in Singapore that do serve italian food that is more traditional.I was not impressed with the food, not impressed with the prices at all.The only good thing I can say is that location is very nice on Club Street, which is a good place to start the evening in Singapore

I don't know why this place has had any negative reviews as every time we have been there we have thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Their ravioli, both the beef and the veal, are absolutely delightful and our 98 year old daughter asks to go there almost every weekend

Just had dinner here in cuginiÂ last thurs night with my boyfriend who is a big eater and a self proclaimed food critic. Haha. Our first time here in cugini, an italian restaurant recommendated by my italian colleague. So it definitely can't go wrong. We ordered antipasto misto for 2, 1 diavola pizza and 1 spaghetti bottarga all to share. The antipasto misto was so authetic so italian it reminds me of my graduation trip which i just did in italy. When the pizza arrived, my god, i dont even see the plate, it was huge! But the pasta was the best of the best. Spaghetti bottarga (the taste still lingering in my mind), the taste was so unique and different from all others i tried so far, i see and i taste the mullet roe. I dont know how they do it or what they used. Must be a secret recipe. Even my bf was won over by this al dente golden pasta, cooked to perfection. Love it to the max. We were so full and satisfied. Will definitely come back again to try the 2 pages long of pizza and all the other pasta etc etc. U ll be spoilt for choices here. The 1 thing i regret was not listening to my colleague to make a reservation in advance. But i didnt expect a restaurant to be so crowded on a thurs

love the environment and decor! the restaurant has a beautiful vibe to it and the food is worth the wait too.

Overpriced and poor value for money restaurant. Trattoria Cugini Pizzeria served a bland and flavourless undercooked cherry tomato pizza. We also ordered the squid ink pasta which was half the quantity and quality we get elsewhere in Singapore. Very disappointed. Go to Al Forno or Spizzico
1
Really below-average service, below-average food... chef and managers there not willing to take objective feedback, made unnecessary comments about locals trying to get a discount (even when we already paid)... ambiance is simple although nice, i won't go back just for that, in Singapore, lots of other places worthy of spending your money and time minus the heartache

The first time I went there 2 years ago we ended up walking away without having eaten any food. After over an hour, no food had turned up and they were being so rude about it that we decided to leave.When some friends booked it for dinner this week-end I was pretty sceptical but decided to go along and not change the dinner plans for all the group. Well, this time at least I got to taste the food ! and in a reasonable time to be fair.It didn't start very well as when we arrived they didn't have a table for us despite our booking being on their list... The manager finally sorted it out and put some tables together for our group but they didn't look happy about it... Clearly not a warm welcome...The rest of the experience was still pretty bad, mainly as the food quality was well below par and the service was again absolutely appalling.On the food side, most main courses on the menu are on the very expensive side ($40+) and I decided to stay clear of these to avoid being ripped off on top of disappointed... I went for the ravioli (ossobucco) which I thought would be a safer choice and my wife ordered the risotto. My dish was quite disappointing as the meat was very hard and dry, rather that the usual juicy ossobucco meat, and the portion was not very large (4 ravioli). My wife hardly touched her risotto and it really tasted, smelled and looked awful. Our friends were also not impressed with their food, except the the one who had a pizza.But more annoyingly, the service is still exceptionnaly bad, even to Singapore standard ! The main waitress is just rude and is not very good at concealing it. When we asked if the special pasta was available (apparently it is very good) she just said no and walked away. We had another waitress who was asking us to point at the items we wanted on the menu as she had no idea what the dishes were... On the plus side, she didn't make any mistake but it looked so unprofessional...In a nutshell, this is a glorified pizza place trying to rip you off with expensive dishes that are really not worth the dough. And the worst part is that they don't even rip you off with a smile

Patronised this restaurant twice and I found the quality of the food has been inconsistent . I personally like the Prawn and Mullet Roe Spaghetti and it was delicious on our first visit, but on our second visit it was under seasoned. The Fresca Pizza was also bland. Seafood and Mushroom Risotto was decent though.Well, for its price I would expect more from here. I would come back again to try out my favourite Prawn and Mullet Roe Spaghetti. Service needs to improve as well

Went there for dinner yesterday, and I have never encountered such a bad dining experience before. Now where do I start? One of the reviewers mentioned that it was rushed - that would be an understatement. 1. Serving staff / hostess milling around doing nothing even though the restaurant was only 40% full, while we wait at the door. We had to seat ourselves.2. They serve free tap water, but I only realized this after we had ordered our bottle of sparkling. Even though I asked for regular water, I think the pretended not to hear my question, and repeated 'sparkling or still' :) SO ask for regular water if you don't want to shell out $7. 3. They cleared my dining companion's appetizer plate, even though he had a couple of bites of food left, without asking. He had put his fork down for a few minutes, and - BAM - the plate's gone. 4. THE BEST PART: The bill arrived at our table - even though we had not requested it - before we had finished the last slice of pizza. And this was at around 8.30 PM, it's not like they were closing up, or they wanted to turn our table over to another dinner party. No question of whether we wanted coffee, dessert etc. Well, thanks for making that decision for us, Cugini!I have NO idea what they were rushing us for like this - it was a very unpleasant dining experience. And of course, no pleasantries on the way out, but I wasn't expecting it anyway. On to the food:Strictly serviceable, and not worth what you pay. We had a Daviola pizza (~$27), which had no more than 6 paper thin slices of salami on it. Quite stingy with that. I've had better pizza elsewhere. We also tried the lobster risotto (~$35) which was OK, but I don't think it's worth that much. Can't comment on desserts, due to point no: 4 above. Still annoyed. Never going back, and would not recommend to anyone

I was there last night with my wife. We had a couple of pizzas : the mozzarella was like plastic and the tomatoes looked and tasted nothing and were worn out..Worst pizza that we ever had in Singapore !One glass of wine each ( scarce ) and a small mineral water : 100 s$ ! a total rip off.The place manages to be sad despite the Italian theme and the service is phoney and sloppy.A very ordinary place that we feel to discourage anybody to try

First of all, it is so noisy that you can’t even have a normal conversation. We ordered pastas and they were both cold. When I asked the waitress to warm it up, she was very unhappy and didn’t even say sorry… Pasta had no taste and the whole experience was just terrible. I don’t even need to say that the quality is nowhere near the price you are paying for… There are so many nicer places in club street and please avoid this one!!!
5
So you want pizza? I think this is one of the best in Singapore. Why the best? Well I can always book it and it is in a busy area, so there is stuff to do afterwards. Go for the calzone, the bufala or the special. Wine list not bad either
2
Besides that it is located in the popular Club street, there is nothing to rave about.Causal ambience but prices of a high end restaurant. First impression, the menu was worn out and it was scotched-taped to keep it intact. Possibly still acceptable with the trattatoria feel but when i saw the prices in side, I can only cringe.Food portions were small. It doesnt taste too bad but wasnt outstanding.With the number of Italian restaurants in Singapore and in that area, I will not make a repeat my experience
