This review if for the branch at timbre+.Had a very satisfying lunch with my colleague. Glad that we ordered the boneless chicken set with salted egg yolk sauce and chicken wrap with default heritage sauce to share. The set at $10.90 comes with a main, a side (fries, onion rings and coleslaw) and a drink. We upgraded one side to spam fries at extra $2 and they were really good. The big slab of boneless chicken was fried to perfection and soaked in a very addictive salted egg yolk sauce. The chicken wrap set is less of a value of money. The wrap has lots of veggies but little chicken. However, the two sets were good as they complement each other, one on the heavy side and the other light.

Too much temptation. Two Wings called out through its visual menu. And it surely caught our attention, while surveying other offerings of nearby stalls. You have to try their Salted EggYolk chicken wings. Simply delicious. Crunchy outer layer plus the flavor of salted egg. It doesn't come with a dip as the flavorful sauce is poured over the freshly cooked wings.

Definitely two thumbs up for Two Wings. You need to share with a couple of friends or couples because eating just 2 is not enough. Freshly cooked on the spot, once it is done they will send you a sms to collect. It is juicy and nicely deep fried with just the right amount of batter. It is not that salty, just nice

Tried both locations - Bukit Merah & Pinnacle. Wish there is a branch in the East too.Love the wings & presentation - crispy, big-sized and meaty. Goes well with beer, esp at the Pinnacle location which looks like an air-conditioned canteen with rows of tables & chairs. Potato wedges and cheese sticks come in small metal buckets - easy to pass around for sharing. Good for after-work drinks due to its location near cbd.Coming back soon

I went to the new outlet at Pinnacle during a Saturday evening and saw few people and decided to order a chicken cutlet. This is my second visit and my mum loved the cutlet when i bought it for her. Beware..... thou there isn't any queue... you will realise that people sitting all over are carrying beepers awaiting for their orders.. So, as i witness plates n plates of wings being dished out... i patiently waited for my cutlet. It came with 2 sides at 8.90 and the sides were generous in servings. It was too big a portion for me. You might wanna consider the ala carte if you are a small eater..I will go back... in the earlier evening thou.I have tried the wings with the chicken rice chili before and it has been delicious. Thumbs up!

It really indeed live up its name, can only have 2 wings as the the 3rd onwards, u will felt a bit salty. Other than that, it is indeed an awesome chicken wings. Nicely deep fried, taste great. Even after 30-40 mins, it is still crispy!!! Bear in minds, 40 mins waiting time is normal

I heard about this stall selling chicken wings and I popped by one evening after dinner time to try. I reached at 9.20pm and was the last customer for the night, as they take last orders at 9.30pm. I ordered 6 pieces of their fried chicken wings for $12.50. The wings are made to order, where they will coat the wings in batter and deep fry it for each order. This ensures the chicken are hot and crispy. I waited about 10 minutes before an SMS was sent to my phone to notify me that my order was ready, which I need to self-collect from the stall. The chicken has a crispy outer shell and the meat was moist inside. Its not bad. Best to eat there, as it doesnâ€™t taste as food after 15 minutes, when it cooled down.After eating 2.5 wings, my craving was satisfied. They also have other items on their menu, which I will try next time

So I tried their new outlet at the Pinnacle. It's a stall in a posh food court hidden away at the back of the development, closer to the tanjong pagar side. Fried chicken wings were huge and came piping hot. We also had half a spring chicken with 2 sides. Portions were generous and prices reasonable. Worth checking out

Ever had fried chicken wings and be able to wash your hands clean without soap? That's because these wings are not dripping in oil!Located admist a row of hardware shops, tyres shops and motorcycle repair shops is this atas coffee shop that sells an array of western food and Two Wings is the only "local" option here. The fried chicken wings here are the real deal. The whole drumstick, wing and tip!Glancing through the menu, their prices are reasonable, especially the cheese fries for $4.50!We ordered the Festive Platter to share amongst 3 people, even though they recommend it for 5-6pax, and that's actually true, we barely managed to finished the platter.1. Cheese Fries $4.50That's alot of cheese fries for $4.50 I must say! They are generous with the cheese and mayonaise!2. Brazilian Full Wings ($8.50 for 2)These are some of the best wings I've ever had. It was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. A lof of chicken juices came out and Natalie said that it was just pure juices and NOT OIL! So we were advised to wash our hands without soap to see if our hands became clean without soap. True enough, my hands were clean! The shop staff explained that it was just the chicken juices, and not oil! You should definitely try this out!3. Buffalo WingsThe sauce was the sweeter kind, not so spicy and it was quite oily, in comparison to the fried chicken wings. The pieces were big and juicy. I did like this, but I still prefer the fried chicken wings!The onion rings were huge but the batter made it very starchy and gerlat. The cheese sticks had the same batter, so I didn't quite like it. Ate like one cheese stick and felt so full. The sweet potato fries were quite bland and should have a slightly more cooked exterior. The chicken tenders were very dry, as it was breast meat and I think this platter requires a bunch of dips, maybe honey mustard of mayonaise or something to keep it alive.For the price we paid, it was a lot of food, and 3 mouths wasn't enough to finish all the food, we had to take most of it home. Nonetheless, on a saturday afternoon, it was quite airy and windy in this coffee shop and it was a good place to hang out and have a meal with friends. The chicken wings will be the talk of your gathering!
