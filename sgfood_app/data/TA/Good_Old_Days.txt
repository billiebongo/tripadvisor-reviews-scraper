I had lunch here whilst I was on Sentosa Island. I had delicious food, great service, wonderful atmosphere in the restaurant, wide variety of choice, fresh food, great location and the toilets were really clean.
I would recommend eating here when on Sentosa Island.

This place is just along the Siloso beach. It is an average place. Staff is helpful. Food is also okay. Will not disappoint you.

Me and my family bought the package for the Wings of Time and dinner Buffet at good old days after researching on the website that they have good ratings, turns out they have two levels of the restaurant, so the dinner buffet was on level 1, and was of Asian variety. We walked in straight after the show, and the food varieties was not much at all. Seems they are short of staff to clear the empty dishes and serve new ones or we just to wait longer for rice and other dishes to be serve out. The laksa soup they have was not hot enough for the noodles to be heat up. And lacking of enough utensils for us to use. There wasn’t a lot of people when we eating there so I dun understand why this level 1 can be so different then the upper level. Or maybe because u have to pay more to have better service and food. Other buffet places that are of average prices can do better then this good old days dinner buffet. But of cause most of the people staying at Sentosa visiting the area sometimes have no other choices to choose are there are alot of people.

For the many good reviews we read online, the food we had did no justice to the price we paid ($18 due to cable car promotion). Having dine at Spuds and Apron by onefabergroup before, it was really a 360degree impression change for the worst. We honestly don’t expect much for the price we paid to dine buffet at Sentosa but the spread was the most pathetic I have ever encountered. Not even comparable to a local economic bee hoon stall. Besides the Laksa, there was no other food that represented Singapore’s cuisine unless you consider plain white rice, stir fried cabbage, vegetarian bee hoon etc as representatives. Perhaps it would’ve been a wiser choice to dine ala carte on the second floor instead. But there is no doubt this will be the first and last time we will ever dine here regardless

Hubby and I came here on recommendation of a write up. Very disappointed in food as was small portions for the not cheap price. Food itself didn't taste how it was portrayed. My sweet and sour tasted like curry. Service poor

The price is on the high side. The food quality is good! Was totally surprised by the reasonable portion of the food. The serving was just nice and it was quite fast. The staff were all well mannered. The down side was this restaurant doesn't have toilets. The nearest one is quite far away

I brought my kids here and we ordered the Satay and the Chicken Rice. I have to say that the pricing of the Satay is on the high side, but the Chicken Rice was absolutely worth the money paid. It came with chicken, vegetables, soup and a huge portion of rice. I was afraid that the food may not be enough for all, but it was! The staff on duty were friendly and attentive too. I would say that it's a great place to have a taste of Singapore food. It's not the cheapest but definitely worth the money paid if you're comparing to other restaurants in Sentosa

The dining here was sort of predestined as it was part of the ticket for Cable car + Wings of Time show, though we did not know it at the time of purchasing the ticket. Knowing it later as part of ticket was a pleasant surprise!We found the menu limited but stuff available was fresh and tasty. It added to the happiness to find a number of vegetarian options including one in desert.Do not forget to try adding vegetarian chutney (sort of seasoning kept along side seafood/fish tofu) which added to the taste of rice. The noodles are truly the best out of all.The staff was extremely cooperative and smiling. Liked it despite limited choices available :

We were given a coupon here when purchased a cable car ride to Sentosa. Our coupon was valid for a dinner buffet. Lookinh at the place outside, it was great looking. The ambiance inside was okay. The food comes in very limited choices. 2 fruits (watermelon and orange), 1 salad dressing, salad veggies (carrots, corn & lettuce), 1 soup (corn soup), 1 fried rice, 1 chicken recipe (w/mushroom), 1 pansit, fish fillet and fish tofu like. 1 choice of pastry cake. I was expecting a variant range of choices.

First, this is one of the free things you can opt from the package of 4 out of 17. Me and my friend went there by 5:00 pm before the Wings of Time show as they are adjacent for their buffet dinner. It is very spacious. The spread is rather good. I loved the salad, soup options and the main food. My friend was veggie and he too got atleast 5-7 items to eat. Infact when they changed a dish towards the end, the server came to us on his own stating that there was 1 more veggie dish to try. Food was very tasty. Only the desserts were disappointing. They all tasted the same. Instead of 4 sticky rice type desserts in different color, they could have kept 1 ice cream!!For the price, for which I could get 1 full meal whereas the same coupon could have been exchanged for 1 fancy C+Nut+Ink ice cream, trust me try this for dinner. All the other restuarants on the beach station are quite expensive

I had my dinner here with my coupon that I purchased with cable car ride. There were several dishes and I liked the noodles. It is in the middle of Sentosa Island. Go to 1st floor if you like to eat buffet.

For a casual restaurant in a resort area, we thought this was much better than we expected. They make the food after you order, so it comes to you fresh. Good option to get out of the heat and humidity.

The Good Old Days offer both Asian Dinner Buffet and A la carte menu where we felt as if we were traveling back in time. The food is delightful and affordable. The place offers a variety of tantalising local favourites like laksa, chicken rice and so on
3
Nothing to rave but it does offer a good local fare at decent prices. The food are decent on the island, and service was good and the staff wears a smile on their face. Something you would expect but not readily available elsewhere on the island.Try the Beef Kway Teow and Laksa as they are good. The satay is authentic but the Rojas disappointing.A common and accessible place for a quick local fare. Not perfect, but nice touch on the island

It is a nice place to dine after a long day in Sentosa. It is located in the Beach station just in front of Wings of Time. Though the food choices are limited, it would still make your stomach full. It is expected to be crowded during peak period as the tourists flock this place. The food serve are local food. They also provide fruits, desserts and drinks included.

This place caught our eye as we strolled around Sentosa. The concept was enticing. I mean everyone misses the good old days. Unfortunately none of the tastes I experienced reminded me of the street food I ate in Singapore in the 60's. And I appreciate that may be just me. It was cheap. And I guess you always get what you pay for. But so was the street food of the 60's. I won't go back

We had the buffet in the lower floor. The spread was not good. Only very few items were palatable. But if you are in a hurry to visit the WOT show then this could be a time saving option since it located just opposite to that.

We came initially because the price was decent and we could have a proper place to sit down and eat (as opposed to the other food outlets nearby which had only limited seating) and have been repeated customers since then..Our usual orders would have included the Chicken Rice set (c/w trio of chilli, ginger and dark sauces, soup) though I felt the serving size of the rice was slightly smaller than what I would have liked it to be.Briyani was also nice and more suitably portioned than the chicken rice.Wok classics like beef hor fun and sam lor has decent "wok heh" though the beef quality was slightly disappointing.Good thing about the outlet is that they do allow you to serve your pre-ordered dessert as and when you need it, this is important for fast melting stuff like ice-kachang..Look forward to the next time to try the Hainanese chicken cutlet.

We are a family from India visiting Singapore. We had spent the day at the universal studios and had wanted to have dinner and so headed out to the beachfront.The restaurant is right in front as you get off the train and so we decided to give the place a try.The ambience of the restaurant is nothing over the top. Since my family and I were here late in the evening there weren't many people.About 4 other tables were occupied. There was one guy who helped us find a table, we settled down ordered and ate. The food was really good! The price pocket friendly. The people at the other tables left one at a time and the staff- about 3 women and 1 guy, all thanked them as they left. We were the last ones to leave as we left not one of them acknowledged us in any way which both my husband and I both found rather unfriendly! As we walked out my husband wanted to just see if it was just possible that they probably didn't notice us leave and so he went back and asked to use the washroom for which he was directed to by saying they didn't have any and he would have to use the ones outside the restaurant and even as he left, he was left without any acknowledgment!!!! I must say simply out of sheer nasty way for having been treated I would never visit this restaurant never mind the taste or the price.I don't believe in making a big deal out of such behaviour however when you are representing your country and even more so in the hospitality industry it's totally unacceptable and verging on being racist.I'm sorry but Good old Days is going to stay in the past

Poor quality, customer service and overpriced. If you are tourist, too bad this is only place nearby for local food and anyway you cannot know the differences.

Nice place to eat while spending time on Sentosa, restaurant serve buffet on the ground and a la cart upper floor. Buffet provided with some selection and good to try!

我們買了Original Sentosa Experience - Combo C 的套票，包了一個自助晚餐在Good old days (在地下樓層) 內享用。菜式種類很一般但勝在夠飽，Laksa的湯真是要讚，純正新加坡椰漿風味，好好味！在高消費的聖淘沙島，這不失是個好選擇。

We purchased a voucher for a buffet dinner and WOT show. Dinner was Indian style cause of the Deepavali fest and was quite enough good.
2
The food was nothing to rave about and there wasn't a whole lot to choose from on the menu. It was fairly priced but I wouldn't go back again as the food lacked favour

Prior to seeing "Wings of Time" went here as had discount vouchers. We were given an order sheet that listed meals & drinks available that you mark on for yourselves after choosing from an illustrated folder. Meals between 8-18 SGD, avg.about $12. 4 meals & 4 drinks cost us $55 before a $12 disc. Lots of tables but try & go early
4
If you're gonna watch Wings of Time and will be in Sentosa prior to the show, no need to buy the set dinner tickets online. Just go there straight and the sets offered cost less. Having said that, food is okay. Nothing fantastic but it will do since resto is right across Wings of Time entranc

Today visited Sentosa with a Slovenian friend. My friend requested to have local food for dinner. Took him to take the Sentosa Express to Beach Station. Few steps to Good Old Days Restaurant. Clean bright spacious aircon local delights restaurant.Ordered Hainanese Chicken Rice ( 海南鸡饭套餐）set inclusive of soft drinks and dessert. He enjoyed this local delicacy with ice kacang (七彩红豆磨冰）very much. About $16 per person.Glad that I made the right recommendation since he tried satay the other day. Enjoyed. Will come again

Had dinner here on a weekday evening.The restaurant offer a la carte as well as buffet dinner. We didn't want to eat too much so we decided not to go for the buffet.The staff who served us was really helpful and friendly. The staff at the ordering counter and those who cleared the table were also friendly.We ordered Laksa, Chicken Briyani, and watercress soup. We asked them to use only rice-noodle for the laksa (instead of mixing it with the yellow noodle), and they accommodated our request without making any fuss.The food portions were reasonable, and they all tasted good. We felt that the price was reasonable too. The only not-so-positive point was that the options on their menu were rather limited.Overall, this place was worth visiting especially if you are looking for something local

We purchase the "Premium Seats" for the Wings of Time show and this gave us vouchers for S$3 off the price of our meal here. The menu choices were not huge. The food was ok (not the best Laksa we had tasted), just nothing special. Not licenced either.It is very convenient to the show
