The duck was acceptable, the noodle stir-fry with the duck meat was excellent.
As usual the flaky egg tarts are nice.
Tampine Mall branch 28/1/18 (dinner)
3
Went to the branch at bugis Junction, ordered the XO seafood fried rice and one Yuan Yang Dim sum. Both tasted quite normally especially I have higher expectations on the fried rice. Not fragrant enough for the fried rice. Price also at expensive range.
3
Meal is average. Service is good. Quick. They even change my order. Dessert is very good. Too closely placed tables.
3
Had a steamed dumplings and entree serve of roast pork for $56. Service is average. Paid for the decorations
2
For the price I am paying I will expect more. The service was really bad! The staff appeared to be unfriendly and not smiling at all. Too many staff and only 5 tables were taken and yet the service was not up too standard. Don't even consider sign up as member which need to pay $18 !
2
Came to Crystal Jade Kitchen to have dinner- firstly, we waited for our order to be taken , and although I raised my hand to attract the attention of the waitress, she ignored me. Thus, I went up the her and asked politely if she could help us take our order. And when my mom commented how long it took to get someone to take our order, she just smirked and ignored my mom. Secondly, we waited for our food to arrive for a long time, but no food came. I then raised my hand and another waitress came to our table. I asked her why hadn’t our food arrived yet, and she got annoyed and exclaimed,rudely, in Chinese,” Need to wait first what!!The service given by the staff there is horrible, and the food wasn’t fantastic either. The fried egg with tomatoes had more ketchup than egg! The minced meat was drowned with gravy too.Will not come again
3
The food was quite ordinary that I couldn't really recall exactly what we ate, even though it was just two days ago.What I did remember was that we had to request the waitress to serve the food for us when she just left the platter on the table.And we had to ask her to do that for every course.We ordered the 3 sets for 4paxs@ $168 as there were 13 of us. I thought that it was rather expensive for a set lunch.Nothing about the food stood out. I did make a mental note that the deep fried fish and deep fried prawns were 'mid size', not quite up to the standard of a good Chinese restaurant
3
For my last dinner in Singapore I decided to go to an authentic Chinese food restaurant. When I got there I sat down and noticed there was no silverware. I was a little irritated because there was just chopsticks. Our food was quick and I was glad. I ordered honey roasted BBQ pork with roasted duck. I tried the pork it was outstanding! But when I tried the duck I was disappointed in the taste. I was stuck between this restaurant and London Duck. I choose this one. My meal was good but not that good. I still recommend this
3
A chain restaurant offering upscale asian cuisine. Was not at all impressed by the food - i took its signature dish - Pecking duck and it was far from the best ones I tried in my life. Other stuff was OK but not Wow. I wouldn,t want to go there agai
5
Our ordered items was fabulous, decent in portion, delicious in taste. A table for 3 pax, 3 mains, 3 dim sums - we enjoy every bits of it. For $9.90 - a selection of one dim sum n a main of congee or noddles, surely cheaper then some less local foodcourt. For wider selection there's also $12.90 tea special.The service personnel were mostly v friendly, attentive to refill tea, inform the name of the items when serving on table. One mid age lady make an extra miles to refill our tea even when she was on her way out after her shift work. When we thank her for her efforts she simply reply that's doesn't cost much of her time n is happy to help.Congrats to the management for hiring such attentive, delicates staff
4
Excellent Cantonese restaurant that serves consistent dishes including wonderful dim sum. Frequented by locals, there are multiple locations, but this particular one is a favorite.
4
Located on B2 of Ngee Ann City you'll find Crystal Jade Kitchen which tends to specialise in Cantonese cuisine. So if you enjoy congee or roast meats it's a great place to have a break from all the shops in the mall
5
Variety of dim sum (dumplings) are available for lunch. For dinner, there are many choices of dishes.All are tasty and delicious. Can try some buns, biscuits and desserts from the bakery as well.
4
like this fast and friendly Cantonese place for noodles, tim sum and/or congee. orderly and organised although a bit noisy these days. good food and tim sum. reasonable price as well. good place but you had better go early so that the waiting is not that long. just wnated to say that thsi picture of the restaurant is totally true of another Crystal Jade Kitchen at Holland Village. i buy takeout food there quote often. i had to wait for at least 20 mins from payment and then for the last two times including yesterday, the kitchens people were just busy talking and chatting and always forget to prepare my orders. the waitress was very very apologetic and kept smiling while the kitchen staff were not bothered. i then realized that it was 3 pm and they were taking a break !!!!!!!! what a careless and negative attitude they have. sorry but to add they were mostly PRC staff as well. what a let down in reputation !!!
5
We went here for brunch on our day in Orchard road. I have been here previously about 6 months ago when i was last in Singapore and the standards have been maintained. We were so pleased with the quality of the food. The restaurant was clean and the service was of a high standard. I had dim sum multiple times while in Singapore and this was probably the best. We had Har Gow, Sui Mai, Cheong Fun, Baby Kai Lan and Chive dumplings and it was all amazing. Definitely recommended and i will be heading back here next time i am in Singapore 
4
Visited the restaurant about 330 pm on a Saturday. We were given a number but waited about 10 minutes. Ordered the promo drink cum dessert set at $5.80 each. Have the fried carrot cake , fresh fish porridge and "lui Sha Pao" ( custard bun) .Total costs for 3 of us is S$42.60.The food were satisfying and good service. This restaurant has indeed keep its quality of food. Recommend if you are in the area looking for good Dim Sum to munch. But be prepared to wait during peak hour .
4
I always in search of yumm dim sum in Singapore. Until i bumped into crystal jade dim sum. i stopped searching because i have found probably the best dim sum in Singapore. Especially the prawns/shrimps are fresh and therefore 'crispy'. However i dislike the cramp layout of their tables. I will easily hear the conversation of the next table. Remember to try their ma lai gao
4
Simple but totally delicious egg fried rice and stir-fried long bean in garlic sauce complete with a bowl of hot steamy Szechuan sour mushroom soup would always be a perfect fusion to please your healthier gourmet platter at this "petite" kitchen in Great World City... Otherwise, the authentic Hong Kong style baked honey ducks and chickens come with a little serving of made-to-order noodles would be an ideal supplement !The service is excellent but certain tables at the corner come under the direct wintry blows from the aircon
4
Crystal Jade is a Singapore chain that has gained popularity in many Asian cities. In markets as competitive as Hong Kong's, this is a rare feat. The noodles are crunchy and cooked just right. The barbecued meats are tasty and fresh. My only complaint is that they often sell out early. Service is average
5
We examined all on offer in this multilevel shopping centre and settled on Crystal Jade Kitchen because the food looked good and there was a queue to get in. The food did not disappoint. While you wait your turn for a table you can make your selections from the menu. Service was very good as was the food. The steamed pork & chive dumplings were excellent as was the half chicken with five sauces on the side. Our dinner for two with tea and a beer with a plate of broccoli and plain rice was under $65. Did not disappoint
4
We visited Crystal Jade Kitchen in Great World City. The staff were friendly. The foods were always excellent standard just like other Crystal Jade Kitchen.
4
Excellent food. Bit expensive but good quality and good portion sizes. Staff super friendly and super efficient..... That may be because the restaurant was not full on a weekday.
3
Went there for simple dinner at Tampines outlet. It was quite crowded maybe due to mother day tomorrow. Ordered sliced fish congee, duck rice, cucumber salad, osmanthus & wolfberry cake and herbal jelly. Overall good.
4
Reviews have been mixed recently, my lunch experience, the quality of food and service left nothing to be desired. We enjoyed a good business lunch and came out satisfied and happy customers
5
Went here with a supplier for lunch and I couldn't stop eating even one I was full! Dumplings were magnificent, particularly the Shanghai ones and the spicy beef really ticked the boxes Considering Singapore is not the cheapest place to go;this was exceptional valueIf in Singapore this is a must
4
It's very good yum cha for very affordable price - the other Crystal Jade restaurants are pretty much the same but this one is not very high end - no white linen just simple yum cha setting but the food is great!The roast pork and the chinese pork is very yummy, the yam football is the best I've had ever! siomai is tender and tasty. The fried tofu is delicious too. I would just say delicious to everything although we just ordered more the steamed dishes rather than fried. If you order tea, they give it to you in a glass (rather than a tea cup) and fill it up when finished as opposed to give you a whole tea pot and pour yourself.Try it! dishes for yum cha average at S$5.50. The wipes are extra so if you don't want to use it just return it or push it aside and the waitresses will know you don't want to use it.the service is not too bad although they are not the friendliest of the bunch - it's nothing personal I think; just the way they are
4
The xiao long bao outlet at taka 4th level has closed. So went to this instead. Prices are quite similarly priced, but be sure to expect a smaller portion. Food quality wise similar to XLB, not too heavy on the taste. Service is good despite the dinner crowd
3
This is one of our favorite restaurants in the town area. They added "hot-pot" recently and apparently this affected their food. We ordered "dim sum" for lunch. But the fried carrot cake is not as delicious and the fried yam rolls were too runny - quite a drop from their usual standard. Have they lost their "dim sum" chef
3
I refer to Crystal Jade Kitchen in Ngee Ann City(which is NOT 350 Orchard Road as stated here)The tables here are set EXTREMELY CLOSE TOGETHER. I have been knocked several times whilst eating.Food is average, they cater for tim sum, quick one-dish eating, and also a few larger tables for group dining.Overall, the set up is clean
1
I used to like Crystal Jade (Holland Village outlet), but gradually the quality has gone down and the prices have gone up. They have managed the transition slowly so people have not woken up yet. I personally woke up last (and hopefully the final) time I visited. The choice of dishes have been greatly simplified so they can hire unskilled cooks. Even with simple dishes the food is no longer great
4
I like the food, ordered Crispy Pork Belly and Ayam Kampoeng, and other dishes. It just taste right although its a bit pricey.
4
Really wanted duck for lunch and this place didn't disappoint. Very busy, popular place. Great old staff, no nonsense and know what they are doing. Fast service, good value.
4
Had lunch here and while the food was good, it was not quite as good as our last visit in 2014. Service was sporadic and not very friendly.
4
At reasonable prices we can enjoy delicious Cantonese cuisine including Dim Sum, Noodles, pork, duck etc. Location is the centre of Orchard Road, Takashima-ya
shopping centre.
3
Simple dim sum not bad. Porridge standard has dropped and interesting dishes been removed from the menu since LV bought over. fried Cheong Fun pretty good with XO sauce. Very long queue.
5
I have been going to this Chinese cantonese restaurant for many years and the standard is still very good. The shop is located at Takashimaya shopping center basement floor. Some of their speciality dishes are roasted duck, braised pork belly, salted prawn, braised eu fu noodle and wanton noodle soup. They also serve nice dim sums. You can trust them for the quality food at reasonable prices and will surely have a enjoyable meal
4
Looked promising but did not deliver as expected.Maybe because we are used to Hong Kong Cantonese style Dim Sum but like most places in S'pore we doubt that it is fresh food.There is some sort of storage & processing involved which detracts the quality.Staff were very nice, as usual
5
CJ Kitchen at Takashimaya is the best compare to other in islandwide. We love the dim sum and the main course as well. The one which I like most is Congee. Dim sum menu also nice. The staff also nice enough every we visit the restaurant. But, there will be long queue in dinner time. Overall, we love Crystal Jade Kitchen
4
I was recommended by a friend of mine, so we went there for late Dinner. The staff was very very friendly, especially to kids and we felt that we were welcomed. (even though with noisy kids!) My understanding is that this is a casual version of Crystal Jade and they serve dumplings, noodles, etc.Well, it was good that people there were friendly to us - but I wasn't impressed by their soup dumplings. I think the other chain restaurant's one is still better. Skin was thicker than what we know, taste was ok, but maybe as we expected better, we were not very impressed. Having said that some of dishes were good. Kids friendly bit helped us a lot, so we will visit again and we will try different dishes for future decision!今回の旅行で初めて行きましたが、スタッフの対応が良かったので気持ちよく頂けました。小さい子供に優しく対応してもらえるのがどれだけ助かるか、食べている物の味がより美味しく感じます。小籠包はここが美味しいと勧められて行きましたが、期待してしまったのか、それほどでは無いと感じたのが正直なところです。皮もいつも行くところより厚めに出来ていたし、味も感動はなかったかな、、、。でも高島屋の上階にあり、お買い物のついでに何処かで食べる。。という状況であれば、良いところではないかと思います。別の本格中華を出すお店と違って、値段もすごく高い訳ではないですし、とにかく子供に優しく接してもらえたのが嬉しかったです。確か同じフロアに中華料理店がありますので、そちらとお間違えなく
4
Excellent stop to refuel for a quick dim sum lunch. The service is fast and efficient and the dim sum comes out hot, steaming and fresh. It's actually as good as most other places in Singapore, but a little cheaper and less fussy. There is an open downstairs seating area that is still quite comfortable with overhead fans. A great spot to sit and watch the hustle and bustle of HV go by. Also an upstairs air conditioned dining area. Recommended
2
Avoid the wanton soup...it use to be good but on this visit the soup is tasteless. Some of our order were forgotten.
4
The staff was super attentive, we did not have to wait long before placing an order, and they have an excellent spread of food! Everything was good!
5
Located in Takashimaya on Orchard Road..Bit expensive but worth the Money spent.Wonderful foodie experience.Fresh Lobsters(live) & Fish cooked in a jiffy & served.Very tasty preparations authentic chinese fare.Must go early in the evening to get a table.
4
I love, love, love it!!! It's got a buttery flavor that is quite yummy. Several locations on the island.
4
I am going regularly for dinner at Crystal Jade in Great World mall. Never I have been disappointed. The service is fast and nice. The food is ok. It's not cheap but you have the choice. I will go again
4
Not a bad place to taste yummy Chinese cuisine. But be prepared for a crowd on Sunday. Service was efficient. Portion sizes was just right.
4
Crystal Jade Kitchen is a great quick stop in your busy adventure in Takashimaya. Service is very quick if you can find a table. Generally quiet busy during lunch hour so better come early or later to avoid long wait.They serve Hong Kong style BBQ, dimsum, congee, noodles, rice and more . Depending on the season, they will offer special dish.Outside they also have a very nice bakery, fresh baked daily on site.Our regular stop while in Singapore
4
Late lunch with my families food was nice however if you ordered Tim Sum it will take about 20 mins to serve on the table while the normal noodle and rice was rather fast.Food was nice service from the staffs was a bit slow manly attend by senior citizen staffs
3
Decent food for a nice location. Place looks great after the renovation. The service was nice. The old aunties were very efficient and friendly; they speak Chinese mostly, so learn some like "xie-xie" to make them happier serving your table. Overall nice food. Good dim sum.
2
Pricing remain while most of the item no longer available on the menu + self service Current menu: Minced meat glued, Pork, Chicken & Beef sliced, Beef ball, Crab stick, Fish ball, Tofu, Tomatoes, Golden Mushroom, TaoPo, Sliced Potatoes, Sliced Lotus, Crispy Fish skin, Seaweed, Egg, Noodles, Rice, Congee...mainly cheap stuff...NO Prawn, NO lamb, No Fish..etc
4
love.the.duck!! :D everytime I visit Singapore, I'll try my best to have lunch/dinner here. Great ambience, super tasty food, but not so-friendly waiters, I must say. Well, bring all your friends and family here, they'll have a fantastic moment :D
5
Excellent chinese food. complete value for money. The beans with mince is my fave. i never leave Singapore without a meal here.
3
1)The menue remains same over quite a period of time.
2)The prices up, quantity down
3)Sevices , so,so
4
Crystal Jade is one of the few places to have these favorites! Dishes are tasty. Prices are not bad.
3
On 9th June 2014, we had dinner in this restaurant. For drinks, we ordered warm soya bean milk, one for me and one for my wife. A few minutes later, a tall glass with plastic straw came, so this one’s for my wife. Waited a few more minutes, before I asked “where’s mine?”. The waitress apologized for the mistake, she wrote down one instead of two. So I waited, in the meantime, I took a sip from my wife’s glass…it’s nice & warm. Then mine came, immediately I took a sip through the plastic straw…whoa, it’s VERY hot (not warm). Until today, 6 days later, my tonque still hurts when I eat something
4
Whenever I have opportunities to trip Singapore, this is one of the places I visit every time. Compared with its restaurant in Hong Kong, this place looks a little old but acceptable. The service is so so as common to any Chinese restaurant but the foods are excellent. However if you expect highly sophisticated experience, I recommend Chrystal Jade Palace located on upper floor in the same Ngee Ann City
3
The name of Crystal Jade Kitchen had been valued for good food and services. However on our last visit to the Crystal Jade in the Takashimaya Complex, we were amazed by the quality of food as well as the service rendered. We can understand the branding of a restaurant. However when the chain needed to branch out to a different segment of the market, isn't it better to use a different name in order not to tarnish the well established one. Grouping different segments and needs of the market under one name is very confusing to generic customers
3
This has been my place to go to for affordable and taste chinese dining especially at the outlet in Parkway Parade but the friendly aunties are now being replaced by people who can only speak Mandarin which makes my dining experience a little unpleasant because I cannot speak Mandarin. They have also change the menu quite a bit and I must say that I loved the old menu of past. Their steamboat buffet is very value for money tho!
2
On 10 Nov I had at Crystal Jade Takashimaya what is probably the WORST Peking duck that I have ever had. I have eaten, and enjoyed, Peking duck in 5 continents, but this one was the worst.Instead of carving the duck at the table, and allowing us to put it together from a central plate of meat, they took the duck to the other side of the restaurant and pretended to carve it. They then returned with a pre-made plate which contained 8-10 pancakes, each with just one piece of duck skin in it, no meat, no plum sauce, no shallots, nothing. After which they served a plate of rice with very small grey cubes of duck and little seasoning ("this cost an extra $12.00”). I am certain that none of this came from the original duck we were shown, and it was luke warm. When I complained about the small quantity, and lack of taste, they offered to charge me another $36.00+$12.00 to serve exactly the same again. I declined. Awful
4
Was there for my brother in law ROM celebrationFood was great, services good tooStaff were helpful but some need to be told what to doWe enjoyed every dishes that were being served on the table for usI think price is abit on the higher side being in Orchard RoadWorth a visit 
4
There are many of these around Singapore. All good food for great price. Noodles are very tasty too.
4
I always thought Crystal Jade Kitchen was a fancy/expensive place, so I've not really been to one till recently. The prices were quite reasonable, and considering the food quality, it's not that much more expensive than the food courts these days. I'll definitely go again.
5
Haven't had a bad experience yet at this restaurant whether in Singapore, HK, etc. Just be prepared to queue for a table during peak hours.
4
I always eat at the Crystal Jade in Singapore. either at takashimaya or plaza singapura. i love the food there. the pork bellies with crispy skin, beans with mince yumm Great ambience, superb value for money.. but most of all really tasty food
5
Good and value for money cantonese food. Love the congee and the dimsum are decent. The fried noodle dishes are equally good. Love the honey watercress drink.
4
Food here never fail to disappoint. No matter which outlet you go to, the quality of the food and service is always good.
5
Try the roasted pork with crispy skin & soft flesh. The congee is of a wonderful smooth consistency. Try also the prawn ball horfun with egg sauce. My favorite, the HK style chilli in oil!
4
Crystal Jade Kitchen is located on B1 level; same level as Takashimaya's Food Hall. Try to avoid peak lunch & dinner hours. Go earlier to beat the long line. Food is good; mainly Cantonese fare. We enjoy the Roast Pork, Soy Sauce Chicken, Fish Congee, Fried Hor Fun with Sliced Fish in light gravy. It's a very busy restaurant. Service is average
3
We hadn't eaten here for more than a year so decided to visit it again. Service was excellent, as remembered. Food was definitely more expensive than the last visit. We ordered a meat platter combo of soya chicken and roast pork for $15.80 ( before taxes). The meats, though delicious, consisted of just a few pieces each though. The other dishes were more reasonably sized - the pork liver congee (we added three pieces of sliced fish for an extra $2) and the tofu were quite tasty. Do try out their chilli - a little spicy but really good with most dishes
4
This is a chinese restaurant that serves chinese delicacies at affordable prices. One dish range from 10 - 20 sing dollars which is relatively average. Though the prices have been increasing over the years, but the quality of food still remains. This is one of the Singaporeans favorite dinner choice.
3
There are many chinese food restaurants in Singapore... the quality of the food has somewhat decline from the time when it first open but it is still good place to go.
4
Almost everything is quite above average. The noodles and porridge are popular. Their vegetable dishes are also well prepared and delicious.
4
This is a great concept, good quality and consistent chinese food.
cant go wrong with them
5
Love the Spinach with 3-Egg dish (egg, salted egg and century egg!)... a must have when I dine there. The beef cubes with pepper is awesome too, so is the claypot liver.
4
We dine at CJK about once every 2 weeks. Good food and the price is reasonable for our family of 4. We like the congee and Dim Sum dishes. Good meal for about $15 a head.
5
You can have dim sum on top of the normal Cantonese food. It is the one place that makes me feel that I am home!
4
Always love the food in Crystal Jade Kitchen but never like their bakery.
The food are tasty and price are reasonable. My girl love the soup.
4
It serves good Cantonese styled food and is well known for its dim sum, roast duck and ala carte dishes. I like their congee and fried rice with salt n pepper bean curd or silver fish. Absolutely my fav to go to place to dine.
4
you can visit Crystal Jade for breakfast tim sum, lunch or dinner. there is a good selection of food to suit everyone. prices are reasonable too. there are different outlets of Crystal Jade selling different specialities, so you may be good to read up first. the staff are polite and helpful although they look rather hurried because it is always crowded at Crystal Jade
4
Bringing relatives to Asia? This is the place. The selections will please even the no Asian food eater in your group. The Peking duck served in a traditional style is as good as you will get in Beijing. Having a celebration? This is the place with no corkage fee! Awesome :
4
A fine place for Cantonese cruisine. Can get overcrowded during peak hours.
5
must try
- dim sum'
- chicken & duck porridge
- wontan noodles
- roast duck
- char siew
3
good food. I was there with friends. There is lots of meaty dishes which I avoid. My friends liked the food very much.
5
Not sure how they manage to serve up the same high quality at numerous outlets across the city. Variety, volume and taste - they have the formula very right
3
Extensive menu with authentic Chinese food for the family. impersonal but efficient service of many hungry people in one huge place (NEX). Good Dim Sum, duck noodles, salted egg prawns etc...
3
My review is based on the 1 experience where the wait staff were rude and portions small. I swore never to go back, and have not since.
3
They serve good Dim Sum and roast duck. Staff are great in services
2
We used to love any Crystal Jade, but not anymore, since the reduce th portion and the taste also not so good anymore.
4
Authentic Cantonese food on the pricey side. This outlet in Ngee Ann City has the best team of chefs. Great for business lunches and dinners on company expense account.
3
There are so many chinese restaurant around Singapore and most commonly see is the Crystal Jade Kitchen. There must be something good that It can sustain the Singapore island. Went there for a friend's birthday celebration, we ordered some dishes. I dun really like the soy chicken but the vegetables dishes are good. I remember their siew mai is good also but dun have enough space to order that night.The dessert are yummy as well. They opened quite late at night, so if you want to come here for supper, you will still find the food
5
As I've mentioned in another review I love the Crystal Jade chain of restaurants, for the quality of food and consistency no matter which outlet you eat at.
3
The place is too cramped and noisy. Servings are small for the price charged. Medium portions are good enough for only two small eaters.
4
This is one of our favorite restaurants whenever we are in Singapore. Their prices are a bit upscale but the food are exquisite in taste. Service is sometimes slow, especially during peak hours.
3
The dim sum is good and reasonable. Quite a wide menu to choose from.
4
Been to several outlets n i wld say that their staff r well trained.Very efficient.Love thier dim sums.
5
No matter which one you visit, the consistency of the high food quality is so amazing that you wonder if the kitchen is operated by robots.
4
Up market cuisine. You have to pay for quality food. Almost as good as the food in Hong Kong.
5
We had a couple of fantastic meals here. Its the one in Great world city. Its busy, so get in early or be prepared to queue. The seafood crispy noodles are to die for!
4
This is a chain - the normal Crystal Jade has near perfect traditional dim sum at really affordable prices. The noodles are also great. The menu has a wide variety, almost anything you pick would taste great. You should try the BBQ pork and roasted duck - this is an all time favourite. If you have a higher budget, try the Crystal Jade Korean Restaurant at Takashimaya. The korean BBQ is awfully delicious. Must try: kimchi fried rice.
3
not necessarily Crystal Jade's fault but, I did not experience a great meal here. It could, of course been that I was choosing the wrong options or that the options I chose did not taste anything like they do at home but there you go people, you live and lear
5
I can never get enough xiao long bao! I absolutely love going to Crystal Jade!
3
Yes, they are everywhere and the food really varies from one location to the next. The seafood is generally quite fresh and they do have dim sum, it's just not that amazing.
4
Great choice of dim sum and hand cooked noodles, would recommend the duck and roast meat selections too.
4
We ate at the branch in Changi Airport Terminal 3 and found the queue to be long to get in, but worth it. The Xiao Long Bao are great!
3
Food is reasonably good value, but nothing spectacular with the choices one can find in the city. Only thing I don't like is they charge 30cents for water.
5
One of my favourite resturants that my family and I visit nearly every week. Good service, great home cooked liked food. Have good variety of food and they change their menu routinely. They have a good variety, e.g. as simple as fried rice, noodle or congee. There are also of shark fin soup, stirred fry, steam fish, etc..... even dim sum.... Good place for a simple meal or to try Cantonese cusine. Price is reasonable, depending on what you order, from $35 to $80 for 2 persons with drinks
5
We enjoyed a variety of Dim Sum that bested our China experience. The variety of some items, which we had never come across was outstanding. Each item was done to perfection, with sauces to accent them. Part of a chain, and hopefully the other sites are as good. This one is located in Plaza Singapura, on Orchard Road
2
My husband and I decided to have tim sum at Crystal Jade Kitchen Junction 8. When we arrived there there was a queue so we don't mind joining the queue. Not long after we were ushered to our table in a corner behind and we ordered 5 items. We waited and after about 10 mins the waitress came back to tell us that 1 item is not available so ok left with 4 items. Then another 10 mins she came back to tell us that 1 more item also not available so ok left with 3 items. We waited again for another 10 mins but no tim sum arrived so we asked the waitress what happened. She said she will checked and chased but nothing happened so we waited for awhile and noticed that food was served first to another table near us who came much later. Almost 30 mins spent waiting and no food served. We then decided to leave the restaurant and vowed not to patronize crystal jade in junction 8 again. WHAT HORRIBLE SERVICE
5
We've been residents of Singapore for 7 years now and have been eating at CJK ever since. Zero complaints. What you expect (referring to your memory of the last time you ate the same dish in one of their outlets) is exactly what you get every time! Food,value, service, - very, very perceptive ladies there, way beyond `Excellent'.! One of Singapore's Star Performers. The kind of restaurant I crave to go to after a month in India (my home:) )..now that's cryptic ;
5
We have been to the branch at Tampines Mall a few times already and find the service good. The waitresses are fast in the ordering, clearing and delivering of food. They would also recommend some specials during the weekends, but if you are not interested they would not force it upon you to take it. If you order a pot of tea, they are attentive enough to refill for you and offer to add hot water to the tea pot. Now this is what that 10% extra for service charge which you have to pay for really means. Most other restaurants you end up having to pay that extra 10% service charge, but there is no service what so ever.Food such as the xiao long bao and the other staples such as siew mai, carrot cake, and hau kau are also nice. However, if you are looking for a cosy, quiet setting this would not be the place for you as the seating can be quite close to each other, close enough to hear the conversation from the table next door. It can also get very noisy doing peak hours
4
Have always like eating here, many varieties and superb service
5
Crystal jade is the must go for good chinese cuisine in singapore, you must try the noodles and duck
4
Went for a gathering, Can't remember what dish we ordered. Food was good as usual.
2
try other restaurants and you will get better service and better food for sure. the service standards are really getting horrendous. it's as though i'm going to a local kopitiam to eat
4
Lovely selections of Cantonese Eats

I have been going to the Crystal Jade Group of Restaurants, in cities throughout Asia, for probably more than 20 years and to the Crystal Jade Kitchen in Plaza Singapura in Singapore frequently since it opened. I have always enjoyed the experience and been satisfied. I know I could have gone elsewhere and eaten similar and paid a lot less but I preferred the Crystal Jade experience.My last visit to that branch of the group will be my last visit. The service was bad (we were made to feel that we were an encumbrance to the staff as they tidied up after lunch and got ready before dinner), many items on the menu were unavailable, the food not only didn't taste as good as usual it didn't look good. The Roast Duck and Char Sieu was simply ugly and unappetizing. And there weren't enough wet towels to go around.The bill was still at a 'Premium' price though! Sorry Crystal Jade it is time for some career interviews and maybe some refurbishment at that outlet

This isn't a fancy place. It's located in Shaw Center (getting to the level it's on is tricky, though...just ask for directions!). We had roast duck breast, garlic broccoli and some great seafood fried rice. Maybe I was just hungry, but it was all VERY GOOD! When you're going to be eating every night for a couple of weeks this was just the kind of place we like: comfortable, easy, great service and food. And the price was right

Good place for dinning anytime of the day. I especially like the 'siao long pau' which was fresh and served steaming hot. Meat fillings were generous and tasty. Also, the "char ciang mian" had a very well blended sauce with minced meat. The 'tim-sum' items list was long and most tasted very good. Tried several of their outlets now, varying from lunch to dinner, truly cannot find any 'fault' in their menu planning, food presentation and taste. Of course, the comfort and a true restaurant setting made dinning there all the more satisfying

I went to ur branch at nex with my colleagues and friend the food was nice i thought of telling my other friend about this place but ur service is really VERY BAD. we went into the restaurant at 20:47 pm ur staff tell us the last order is at 21:30pm ok we accept this but they did not tell us ur restaurant closed at 22:00 pm. at 21:58 pm one of ur staff walk to our table and said (we closed at 22:00 pm can u all eat faster) HEY we pay for the food and service charge yet we are chase by ur staff. don't you think is very rude to chase away ur customer..... U can tell us u closed at 22:00 pm but u can't tell us to eat faster right is all raw food we also need time to cook.... Please look into this problem i think u have tp provide training for ur staff in customer service... THANK

I come here quite a lot but not very much recently as I am always disspointed and not exactly wowed. My food came 1 hour late and all they had to do it cut up chicken and prepare rice! The staff aren't very well spoken in English but are friendly

The food is generally good and the price decent.

Common Dim Sum served. But their roast pork is simply fantastic!! make sure the skin must be crispy, the underlying meat must be tender. Super sinful dish. Now you know why I look like myself. Their porridge is also nice, remember its "Ji di zhou". Real tasty

Scallop Porridge, salt and pepper squid, zajiang chicken and french beans are my favourite

Prefer the crystal jade xiao long bao. With more dim sum varieties and nice xiao long bao.

A perennial favourite. Crystal jade never disappoints. Noodles, timsum, beef or seafood dishes. All good.

Love the food at crystal jade. Dim sum is good and their la mian is really nice!
5
great cantonese & shanghai cuisine...beats some of the nice restaurants in hk even!
3
Pretty good cantonese food but majority of the dishes are covered in black thick oyster sauce which in the end make them taste the same.
3
Waste of good money on average food ...
4
really awesome peking duck

Normally, I wouldn't be noticing this restaurant... but after 10 days in the US... Chinese food just tastes so good. This is as chinese as it can affordably get. Yang Chow Fried Rice, Brinjal in Claypot and some tofu soup.

Still serving pretty decent shui jiao and beff brisket noodles.

Try their pan fried chee cheong fun. Something different from the steam type.
