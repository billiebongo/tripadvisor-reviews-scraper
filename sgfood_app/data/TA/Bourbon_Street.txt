Fabulous Singapore slings made here and half the price of raffles. Definitely worth a visit. Such a friendly bar.

We went here by accident - we couldn't decide where to go and this place was open. What a find it was! From famous bourbon names to their own house blends, this place has something for every bourbon lover (or newbie).There's very weak wifi, so talk to each other! And be prepared to spend

Great hole in the wall to sip on cocktails & catch up with friends. Quite an extensive menu. Nice music playing in the background & chill vibes.Special shoutout to the GetChug app that feeds the alcoholic in me. It's a monthly subscription for selected bars in Singapore - you pay only $14.90 a month & you get to redeem a drink a day. If you are super auntie & love saving money (like me) as much as you love alcohol (also like me), this is perfect for you. Use my code YINGHUI2031 to get $5 off your first subscription - & of course, #ulteriormotive, it benefits me too But seriously, GetChug gives me an excuse to bar hop & try different cocktails/explore different places. & find nice ones like Bourbon Street :
