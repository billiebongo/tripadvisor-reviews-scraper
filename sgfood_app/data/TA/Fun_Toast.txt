The outlet in Liang Court has the advantage of not being too busy so it's usually possible to get a seat and lines aren't usually too bad. Standard quality food and drink with standard pricing.

Visited the outlet at City Link mall this week for a tea during the afternoon. It was pretty empty so no issues with delays getting served or finding a table. Tea was pretty much the same as you would expect at any of these standard chains

We have tried the Singapore breakfast at Sprolo in Perth before coming here and so knew what to expect. The Kaya Set breakfast is a cheap but great way to start the day. Two eggs, toast with Kaya (coconut) jam a bit of soy and white pepper - absolutely delicious and the cost at any Fun Toast outlet is $5 Sing. Nothing flash but really tasty

Was there for coffee break after our lunch at Kallang Wave outlet Coffee was good. Realised that they have assortment of traditional healthy drinks which are diifferent from other coffee stalls. Their seats are comfortable and table is big enough. A good place to chat and rest after shopping

A great chain of fast food with a difference. Basically although there are lots of drink options this is the fundamental principal A toast set = Coffee and various toast sets ( i.e. a choice of 6 toast versions with 2 boiled eggs + drink) or (a choice of 6 Asian dish versions with 2 boiled eggs + drink) . In the Kallang wave this Fun Toast has lots of seating and is a great window for people watching or just chilling over a simple but delicious fast food (but eat at your leisure) lunch. The quality across sites I have tried are good. A great reliable go to healthy 'fast food' chain. Very friendly.The Beef Rendang is very tender here

We try Fun Toast located at Bugis Station.. In the morning, we look the queuing there, so i think we must try this one, and its perfect since they have rice set with beef rendang and chicken curry.. also the tea they serve.. will come back here to eat when visiting Singapore again.
