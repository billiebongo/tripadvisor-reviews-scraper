We ordered both Ginger onion & Gong Bao clay pot frog.
The vegetable was surprisingly tasty.
The porridge serving is small not enough for 2 ladies.
This place is crowded and hard to get a car park lot

The restaurant is famous for bull frog claypot. The frog claypot should be eaten with porridge. The frog is very tasty. A lot of locals are going to this restaurant for frog claypot and porridge. Reasonable price.

Review by Dr Sim. I found the food average. However, others seem to enjoy the Frog Porridge. Maybe I ate the wrong dishes. Service is basic. Regards Dr Sim

Porridge not as smooth as the geylang outlet. Service staff are not friendly and no patience. Spicy frog still delicious..overall experience so so.

Very crowded on weekends dinner timing, which means is a popular eatery. There is no real queuing system to have to rely on integrity of the customers to queue up. We were 2 pax and Ordered 4 frog (free 3 frogs) for $30, which = 7 frogs in total + porridge and with kung bao sauce (spicy). The food was great, porridge was nice consistency and texture and not too watery. The frogs were delicious, not too spicy but the shiokness from the spices are there. For 2 pax actually 3 frogs (+2 free) total 5 frogs will be sufficient portion, unless you love to eat frogs (i love to eat frogs). Service was pretty basic but they are polite. Saw them entertaining a customer-from-hell without losing their composure

For some, it's simply great tasting while others say it tastes like chicken. The first time I was there, it was with friends going for a late dinner. We are a mixed group of these "eaters".Yet there are those who find it too exotic to even think about.This was when I visited with my family and I ended up eating the frog legs in the claypot on my own while they tucked into local dishes that accompanied this amphibious dish.I had joked about having "Farm Chicken" dinner (the Chinese words when literally translated) and this was meant to be a pleasant surpise but I found out that they didn't share my humor and since then, it was a long wait before I had this again.This time, my wife had blessed me in a loving way, choosing to sit through the dinner with me while I had my Claypot Porridge with the Ginger Union flavor (the next time, I will have the spicy "Kungpao" flavor). We had other accompaniment - Marmite Chicken, stirred fried French Beans, and Thai Coconut.It was a great dinner for me after a hard day's work. If you like porridge but not the frog legs, this is also a good place to go to as they do have other nice local dishes to go with the porridge.By the way, they have 2 other branches in Geylang area..

Frog porridge is a famous dish in Singapore that you should try here. You can find many restaurants serve this at Geylang area or at G7 Sinma located near Bukit Timah. The frog is spicy, sweet with very nice black sauce. If you can not eat spicy food, let the waiter know, they can put less chilly inti the frog; but recommend let them serve as normal so you can enjoy the real taste. The frog went well with the white porridge, put lots of sauce mixed with porridge and enjoy it. The sauce is not salty and the porridge is blank, so don't worry. We also ordered omelet egg with oyster, the taste was not so special, the oyster is not so fresh but the sauce is very nice. You can try the samba morning glory; it's a little oily but it's nice. S$20 per person

We cannot help it but every time when we are back in Singapore, we have to come here and eat their spicy frogleg porridge.If possible a few times during our stay because it is very good. Always cooked just right and spicy enough but not to spicy. Also there other dishes are very fresh and crisp. We love their longbeans!It might not be the most inviting place to walk in but it is clean and the food is great so i strongly recommend it

Not a big restaurant, but very cozy. Staffs are polite, and food taste great! Dining area is clean, and god served fast. Lots of parking writhing walking distance ... great place to eat

The restaurant is not really in the tourist part of town so it's a bit of a challenge to find. They have a large menu but the frog is really worth a try as they are cooked in clay pots, also suggest tasting the portage.

Not the cleanest place, If your up for a beer and sone frog. Its the right place. A beer is around SIN$10 Food ranges between SING$ 6-14.
No one speaks english here. Sign language works.

This restaurant serving good porridge with delicious kung po frogs and other delicious dishes. The fish slices cooked with bitter gourts are nice combination which suitable for all ages. Signature tofu and spinach with century eggs are good
5
The frogs are fuuuyoh. If you are a frog lover best place to have it even in the middle of the night. The combination was great like buy 2 get 1 free or something. worth the price.

It's our usual getaway for comfort food. Our regular order includes a pot of spicy frogs, porridge, house special toufu & sambal kangkong.
Always an amazing meal... Always satisfied.

The on-going promotion is to order 3 frogs that come with 2 free.. Each frog order is S$8/-, so for $24, you get 5 frogs cooked. You can choose to have them cooked in 2 ways, with ginger and spring onion, or KungPao style, or one of each. They do serve other side dishes for ala-carte orders, eg. vegetables (sambal kangkong, Si-Ji Dou, bittergourd with eggs, etc), and also prawns / beancurd, etc.For those super-hungry, you can order rice as well, though the best complement to the frog claypots is the porridge, nice thick and creamy texture

This is by far the most delicious food that I have tasted in Singapore. I will also remember it for a lifetime and I will be sharing these photos with my friends around the world. Next time I will bring lots of friends to share a Bull Frog meal with me.

Just have to remember that food is good especially the frog porridge, aubergine "brinjal" with green bean and the homemade tofu!Need to ask the server that can speak English, because I cannot speak/understand Chinese at all.This will be one of the restaurants that I would recommend to family and friends when they visited Singapore
