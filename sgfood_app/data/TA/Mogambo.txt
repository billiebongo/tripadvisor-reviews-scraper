A very nice place to hang out in the evening. There is lot of food available near and river side views are just perfect for evening with friends.

Love the name and the movie. Nice little place off the main drag to have a drink. Close to Boat Quay.

This bar is ALWAYS buzzing! Weekend crowds are huge, and weeknight crowds are better than most SG bars. Great selection of drinks, and friendly staff with awesome service.

I was in Singapore for 3 nights in Jan 18 , 1st time in Asia. I found this bar whilst strolling through Boat Quay. The bar staff were charming very helpful and suggested some cracking things for me to be doing during the day in Singapore. Leslie and Joe looked after me and were really kind ( as were all of the staff ).  Thank you sure to be back one da

Visited with partner and friend last week, the bar is situated down a side street off boat quay.Great vibe - street seats and tunes pumping out the door, which I liked a lot. Drinks were not too expensive and we whiled away a couple of hours.Walked past the next day (Friday) at 6pm and it was heaving, so is definitely a popular hangout for locals and tourists alike.

This place invariably has a great atmosphere. Yes, it turns into a bit of a zoo at times, with all human life to be seen, but thatâ€™s part of the attraction.The attention of the staff is first class, as even when busy they try to ensure that you have a memorable evening. Very professional, but yet friendly and accommodating.A largely fun clientele which adds to the great atmosphere of the place- the island bar is unusual but works superbly.If you want service with a, sincere, smile- this is the place to come

This place is really fun! Service is fast and the atmosphere is always party like.Sitting outside on the street having a nice drink and staff always at your service. If somebody has a birthday they do something nice and inside the music makes it a really fun experience. Quite touristic so a lot of foreigners.Must visi

I have visited this bar with friends many times but in January i celebrated my birthday there. Had a fabulous time with some fabulous people.The bar is very popular and always busy. It has a great buzz about it and time just seems to go so quickly when we are there. Definitely worth a visit if you are ever in Singapore

Was there with my brother for a drink. Atmosphere looks quite good. Open late into the night compared to the rest of the pubs around the area. Will head down there again to check out the place.

Excellent party vibe. Everybody gets wild once the music gets cranked up. It's right in the heart of Boat Quay.

My friend and I got there just after midnight. A great 'atmosphere' of jolly patrons. Music was recent chart music. Everyone was in high spirits. What ruined it for me was the amount of people inebriated and the potential of them taking advantage of each other. If that's what you find fun. This could be the place for you. I watched potential disasters unfold. #carcrashtv saying that. It wasn't the 'worst' night I've ever night.

Very friendly staff and some good drink deals considering you are in Singapore .The staff were loud and very very friendly always having time to talk and joke with us.Good atmosphere when the bar is full and nice for a quiet drink when it is empty.Lots of sports channels to watch and loads of very load music .Will defo go back on my next visit

I'm not normally impressed by places to write a review but this place makes it worth the effort! Great friendly happy staff, good prices and good looking clientele ;). They all go out of their way to make you feel welcome :

A group of us went into Mogambo around 130am on the 4th Sept 2015 morning and being a school night, we asked and was informed by the waiter that they will close at 3am. We then had about 2 beers ea amongst the four of us before ordering our last round as we were informed at 230am that they were taking last orders, which was fine and understandable.The distasteful part is when their Manager (caucasian guy) who was starting to clear the place up at 230am came over to us and with a look of disgust questioned why we were still drinking outside and demanded we switch to plastic cups instead, which we happily obliged seeing so it was last order. However 2mins later he came over again and demanded for us to leave as he wanted to go home and that if we had been there earlier since 10pm he wouldnt have had any issues with us staying there drinking till 3am, but then later tried justifying his actions by informing us that they close at 230am on a Thurs night. This was definitely very disrespectful to paying customers as we were forced to finish our beers on the street and he was very rude and obnoxious about the whole thing. My circle of friends will definitely not be patronizing this place again due to such utterly dissapointing behaviour and treatment.Your Manager(staff or owner or even co-owner maybe) needs to realise the simple business rule of "Not cutting your nose to spite your face

Had a nice time. Good place to wind down. Had couple of drinks . Very good surroundings. Very attentive serving staf

Getting old Kieso! That's all you could handle? Why I always drink bottled beer and/or liquor! Ha! Mogambo is the best bar in Singapore to have an uninhibited fun time and meet new people. Great music, great atmosphere, great location, great service/staff, and that bell! Unique! One doesn't go there for the food, though it is decent, but the camaraderie of the staff and other patrons to have a great time, whether with a group of friends or by oneself. No other bar in Singapore compares to the environment at Mogambo
5
Great place to forget about the ills of the day...Stopped by the other night, drank 15 pints and probably 1/2 a dozen bombs - lost count. Staff usual mix of lazy and laughing but service must've been ok coz i was totally passed out by 11 ish - i think? Staying away from the food after i was on the toilet for 2 days... Beer is better now as they cleaned the spicyness outta the pipes for the first time in 5 years the other day - think it's coz they've put a new bar in and had to clean it

OK - if you do not like loud music than do not go to this place. The DJ is fantastic, cocktails are nice and they do have live cricket or football matches screened for the not so good music lovers. It's a nice place to have few drinks and dance with friends on a weekend
5
Hosted my 40 something birthday there. Staff were great as usual and was made to feel very welcome. Great array of drinks and cocktails were served up and the food was good. Massive night out and hangover next day to boot. Great evenings entertainment
5
Great atmosphere, great staff and now they've teamed up with "Berg Gourmet Burgers" so great food too.Stepped out with colleagues and had a very pleasant lunch. Service is fast and efficient and the food was of a very high standard.Well worth a stop if you want a tasty burger

Been here many weekends, weekdays too. Solo or with a large group, the bartenders and service staff were always friendly and made me feel like home. Even when it's crowded, the bartenders manage to be super attentive. Definitely a place to check out for a party, or a quiet pint on a school night.And you can't beat having a cold one with some burgers. The Mini Bergs I ordered was a great way to test different flavours, the Porto Pollo being my favourite. The East and West Platter was also fab for sharing with friends, once it's out at the bar, everyone wants a piece!All in all, good times can be had whether you're looking for a regular jaunt, or it's your first visit to Singapore
5
The staff are friendly and cordial, management works hard to make sure the customers are getting great service and the atmosphere is as casual as it gets. Not pretentious at all. If you are looking for a great place to kick back, relax and meet an eclectic blend of different people this is the place for you. It goes from chilled to rocking so you can enjoy the vibe you want by choosing when you stop by.It's not clique, so a traveler or first timer will feel very comfortable just pulling in. I liked the music a lot, It aint your regular latest pop mush, it's the good stuff from when they still made real music. They will even hunt down a request if it isn't too busy and they have it, probably do. Absolutely a, "worth checking it out" place

Went in for a drink on a Sunday night. Music was terrible - full blast 80's rock anthems etc. Witnessed bar staff prancing around, singing like bellends, all cringe-worthily forced. The crowd round the bar doing exactly the same - again, so cringey. I've been in there a few times. This sing-a-long at the bar seems to be something they try to promote as a positive but it's all so cheesy, staged and vomit inducing. It didnt really bother me too much before but this time I wanted the ground to swallow me up. Crowd is the expat 'public schoolboy rugby player trying to be common' look. Wouldn't be a bad bar if they dropped the forced, cringey bar sing-a-long

We had burgers, one chicken and one regular beef, all homemade, even the sauces and dressings! The aioli was especially good :) And the price isn't bad either :
5
There are a lot of fun places around boat quay but this is the place to be. They always throw good parties and the place gets pretty wild on the weekends.It is unpretentious and has a friendly atmosphere so it is very easy to meet people and the staff always make sure that you have a great time. Hanging out inside at the bar is always fun because of the bell but unlike other places in boat quay the outdoor area is spacious, lively and comfortable. The place also has good lunch deals for a burger and a pint. It is definitely worth checking the place out at least once if you are in Singapore.
5
Great place to hang out and make new friends. Good crowds on Fridays and Saturdays and fun theme parties too. The finger foods are good as well, I've tried the chicken wings, spring rolls and the mini burgers. You can choose three kinds of mini burgers so I chose the felafel, fish and beef with swiss cheese and they were all so good!
5
Very good bar, great burgers / pub food. The staff are super! Love them to pieces! Very attentive and friendly. Definitely a place to go if visiting or even living in Singapore

You can wear a suit and tie or a pair of shorts..you can wear a dress or flip flops and Daisy Dukes..either way you will always feel comfotable and right at home in this little bar on Circular Road. They have a wonderful team of floor and bar staff who always make you laugh and add a personal touch to their service. Not a big drinker? Well then howdy-ho you gotsta try their food. When i was on my fitness kick (which didn't last very long but never you mind), i had their chicken breast salad which was sssooooo gewd! I have also had their chicken breast burger, which you can order without the fries, to stick to your calorie count. Their beef burgers are juicy and fresh, and somehow always seem to hit the spot. (along with the Magenrs which i drink along with it) If you haven't been there yet, you're missing out. Oh and if you're lucky, someone will ring the bell or the bar staff will give you an amazing N'Sync dance performance :) Check it ou

Went on thursday, not much crowd, no music, limited choice of drinks and pricey than another bar which is just next to them with great music and better service.
Would not come again.
5
Had a few nights out here and highly recommend it. Burgers are yummy. The service staff are extremely helpful and obliging. Most importantly, the music selection is awesome!!
4
I would havel liked to see that you have a better selection of wine, prefferbly boutique wines and not the mass produce sterile wines which are all over Singapore which you are selling for your house pours.
5
A terrific bar with attentive staff and relaxed vibe, whether watching sports inside or people-watching outside. The best bar in Singapore for small or large groups with great selection of drinks and above standard food. Highly recommended
5
Been coming here for a couple of times with friends & families.. definitely a nice place to chill.. Friendly service, all smiles, lots of fun.. Definitely a nice place to have a couple of drinks to just chill back & relax..

Mogs just gets it right - good service (rare in singapore) and a good crowd - if you are new to Singapore or here and just want to meet up and get a great intro to life here this is the place to hang out.The jager trains are as good as they look on you tube too!!

Apart from my liver cringing when it hears me mention the place, I don't have a bad word to say about Mogambos. Yes, I am no self restraint there.. but that's its attraction for me. The crowd is always fun and friendly, the staff are brilliant all the way from the owners to the bar staff who all get involved in the night and events, and somehow I always have a drink in hand without noticing how it happened. The infamous bells are the cause of a lot of entertainment with many generous (or unknowing) people around to ring the bell and buy you a drink. Indoors or outdoors you'll be having fun and meeting people or having a blast with mates. it doesn't even matter what night you go, something or someone is always there. Weekends are particularly fun though, or even a sneaky lunch time burger and beer are awesome.Go down and have a drink with Rick, Henry and the team, and tell them the ambassador sent you

It is always comforting, when you are thousands of miles away from home, to find a warm, welcoming environment. Good music, fabulous management and an atmosphere unlike any other in SIngapore. From early evening chats with the staff, to late night revellry, Mogambo has it all. The infamous 'bell' can take new comers unaware, but when the free shots start appearing you start to get an inkling that it will be a great night out. The fantastic atmosphere is helped along by the brilliant music selection, a great back drop to the laughter of the patrons. If you are in SIngapore I would recommend swinging by, you will probably end up staying longer than you planned
5
There's something about Mogambo that just keeps you coming back. Friendly staff and management who make an extra effort to get to know you, burgers are great, and the drinks never seem to stop flowing! A busy night can get mental - and that's an understatement - so if you're a wallflower, you'd best be prepared. When the bell is rung everyone at the bar gets a free shot, and there are plenty of generous regulars. Always a great night out, even on the odd Monday or Tuesday.. it always seems like a good idea at the time

Singapore is famous for clubs but the bars are somewhat lacking. It's fun and happening - I can go alone and the staff are wonderful. Nice mix of Singaporeans and foreigners, so you can have some interesting chats with random strangers. The drinks are never too weak and the food is good.
