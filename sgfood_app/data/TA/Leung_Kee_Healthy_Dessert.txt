Tebing Lane came alive with this interesting dining concepts. A lot of options that range from cheap to expensive choices. I brought my family for dinner there followed by dessert at Leung Kee Healthy Dessert. I heard from friends about desserts served there and the local desserts are similar to the Korean Bingsu, except that it is priced very reasonably. There are many options there, juices, ice-cream, pastries and sorbet. The Mango Sorbet is my favourite. Just the appearance of the sorbet will melt your heart. The taste is unique and I will definitely rate it very highly. The only issue about getting into Tebing Lane is that if you are driving, there may be limited parking space. Otherwise it is a great place to spend time with family for a simple meal
