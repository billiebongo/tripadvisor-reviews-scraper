We recently dined at this restaurant and found it to be very good. The beers were reasonably priced for Singapore and the food was excellent. The local staff are happy to stop for a chat which was helpful for us learning more about the area.

Like the previous review we had been walking around when we realised it was lunch. So many restaurants around here we just grabbed the first one.
Service was very friendly and there's food was good, even for a quick lunch.

Well, from the title you should have guessed it. We didn't know this fact :) so we ordered as we usually do at other restaurants. The fact the waitress messed up the timing of our orders has made the Boss himself took care of the situation and i was left a bit embarrassed to be so particular about my order. The Sezchuan prawn dish was our favourite. It was a bit spicier than my boyfriend is used to, but boy oh boy, it was unlike any dish we have ever tasted. To salivate over for! And the portion! Then we understood, why people came in group of 4 or more and order less food than we did :)We visited back in March this year, and we haven't get a chance to show it off to friends and family how awesome the food, since we've been traveling. But we will. Soon

On the main "mall" when you come out of china town station. There are ally of restaurants along the walk. This place looked less seafoody then the rest so in we went. Cheap beers and food. No wine by the glass or spirits. The food was excellent and the service was great as well.

Having strolled from Clarke Quay and all round Chinatown we were ready for a drink and some lunch. There are so many restaurants to choose from we ended up just picking this one as it had some locals in it. The food was very good (but like a lot of times here the food didn't all come at once!), service was ok but could have been a bit more aware. Didn't notice until after - they even charged you for the little towel packets on the table!!! They have only been open a year we believe but worth a try, just tell them to stop charging for the towels!!
