I had a cup of tea and order Nasi lemak packet version is $2.90. When I open it I got anchovies with their heads intact. You think the customers are cats? Should change your Nasi lemak supplier to another better quality one.

Simply amazing! Loved the Kaya Toast and the milk tea! Really worth the price paid. Quick service. Highly recommend.

Doean'r open early enough, the coffee's an overly milky cup of bilgewater, and the toast is at brst, pedestrian.
Same goes for other TB outlets.

This is a great spot to get some toast and coffee. Conveniently around the corner from our hotel, this was a great spot to have a quick and cheap breakfast before starting our day of exploring Singapore.

Delectable local eats, and first and prompt service. The sitting area was designed to be a little small and cramp though, and could have dampen the dining experience.
5
I had a breakfast here only once, and wish I had the time to go back again. The coffee was excellent, and I had some "lava french toast" - the likes of which I have never had before! Very, very tasty.

Firstly the experience watching the coffee preparation is worth the visit alone!! But if you want nice kaya toast and traditional Singaporean coffee for a reasonable price in nice clean surroundings then you have it right here!

To get a traditional Singaporean breakfast which is tasty and affordable is worth the wait in the queue! There is also a theatre to the making of the Kopi and the eating of the half cooked eggs.The peanut butter thick toast alone was enough to keep my ravenous 10yr old going for nearly a whole day of activities and the cost for 2 of us for breakfast was roughly S$10, cheap

The Toast Box is clean, tidy and efficient in providing common good quality, good value, traditional and contemporary Singaporean style breakfast. We had breakfast here few times. Must try one of their toasts and Kopi(coffee). Teh (tea) or go for a set breakfast menu which is less than 6 SGD and all taxes included! Also Keep eyes on the unique hand made Kopi prepared for you while waiting on the queue

First visit to the Chinatown Point outlet - located on Level one - easy to find, has plenty of seating around the outlet plus some inside near the counter/serving area.Had peanut butter toast, two soft boiled eggs plus milk coffee for morning tea.A good deal for $S 5.80.Good for food on the rush - wide range of choices - the sets are good value
4
I had the amazing lava toast and kopi, for a bargain 4.80SGD. The surroundings were clean and staff were pleasant.
5
i always come here for breakfast every time i visit singapore .. the food was nice ,the price is worth it .. and the best part is the half boiled egg..
5
Up until recently my family and I would come here for breakfast every morning. You have to try the Kaya Toast - it's amazing.
5
Sit for chitchat, try different drinks and order kinds of bakeries to share with friends. Good time to pleased your stomach.

Tried traditional toast breakfast. Peanut butter and kaya. Nice quick breakfast with lovely strong coffee.
4
Loved the style of the place, very popular. Had the best buttered thick toast ever and a refreshing passionfruit drink.
looking forward to my next visit.
For 2 breakfasts toast and toast with eggs, a tea and the juice it cost less than $5.

I've eaten at many outlets of Toast Box, tried many items from their menu over the years and I don't think it has ever let me down. It's very local (for those interested in a more Singaporean ambience and flavour), and a perfect place especially for breakfast. I recently got a takeaway Ice Teh Melaka and Golden Lava Toast to try after work. Both were delicious! The teh was a little overly sweet for my tastes but still excellent. They do some pretty decent toast at this place. Strong recommend

Kaya toast set with toast, two soft boiled eggs and coffee for less that $5. The coffee was good and strong, the eggs a bit too soft for my liking and white bread toast. They do offer thick slice Multigrain toast as well, be sure to be clear what you want to order as I thought I ordered this but didn't get it. I preferred Ya Kun's toast and eggs during my stay in Singapore

This can consider budget café for tourist. Why not give yourself a try of Singapore local coffee and toast and some local food since its cheap and its not bad and you can find this everywhere. I always bring my parent and my oversea friends here for breakfast because I want to lets them experience the traditional local coffee and toast (SGD4.90+ per set) . Try the kaya butter toast as kaya only found in Malaysia and Singapore and its nice to try, but a bit sweet. Besides this, they have few variety for you to choose but all toast and coffee sets are below SGD5.00 If you don’t like the toast, you can try their local foods, nyonya laksa (spicy) , mee siam ( spicy & sour), nasi lemak (spicy,rice), curry chicken all not bad, all these come in set or you can order ala-cart too. You can try for brunch, lunch or dinner if you think its too full for you in the morning and its only about SGD$6 – SGD$8 per set. Price consider cheap in this kind of local café with air corn. So, why not

I had a cup of coffee at Toast Box located at Chinatown Point along with the Cheesy Chicken Chop noodles. The coffee was brewed to perfection and i like the way the noodles was cooked. The downside was there are too many customers idling and not moving and the price of the noodles is too expensive. Otherwise, it was a pretty good experience
3
Everything they serve is just so ... square! Nice food, lots of colour and its a funky place to try. Reasonable value - and friendly service
3
Okay food priced which taste reasonable as compared to the Hawker Center priced at a slightly more expensive price, probably due to the rental and the air conditioner.
5
We liked especially the baguette, but all the pastry is also temptatious. Friendly personnel, take away or sitin.
5
Laksa, kaya toast, Jurassic drink, they are all along my favourite Singaporean food! Toast box are everywhere so you could be recharged after a long walk :)
5
Awesome kopi. Be ready to queue but the fresh creamy coffee with evaporated milk is a real treat and a true taste of Singapore
4
Love the kopi there! If you want to experience the Singapore style breakfast/snack then this is a very good start. Kopi with toast and runny eggs is a must-try.
4
Busy, nicy breakfast. Mostly local guests. Different toasts and nice full meal 'breakfast' soups. Delicious kopi cold&hot! Friendly staff

Toast box has many outlets in Singapore and Malaysia. They serve local delights (can I call it fast food) from breakfast to dinner.We decided to have a quick breakfast before our meeting here. We had the traditional toast with 2 half boiled eggs (really perfectly done) and as usual a morning coffee.Besides that they do serve the mee siam nyonya style (which is one of my favorite) where sweet sour broth is placed in it just to wet the mee siam. For a version of local fast food, this is it

This chain store scores high for efficiency. Generally the local tea/ coffee is good. But at some outlets that are too popular, the staff is over-worked and quality suffers. Noticed the food quality is somewhat inconsistent. Perhaps its time to have a Quality Control Director and / or mystery customer to monito

This branch is quite small but with the additional outside sitting space in the middle of the mall's aisle, it helps. The queue here is constant probably because of the excellent location. It is located inside/near the mall's main entrance on the ground floor. Ambience, as with all Toast Box brances is nice. However food is average & expensive.It is only out of convenience & mainly due to aircon comfort that we come here for a snack & cup of coffee after a long walk from shopping. There are much better similar food & at much cheaper prices at nearby non-aircon Hong Lim food centre
