Nice scenery place for wedding event! However place might be inconvenient for people who doesn't own a car, though there's shuttle services.

I was there last Saturday night with friends and we had the set menu for 6. The starter of belinjo crackers with the red sambal was really good. One of my friends requested for the green sambal and it was an instant hit ! I loved that it was not as spicy as the red sambal yet it had that 'tangyness' that goes well with any fried food. The fried fish was gone in minutes - nothing left on the plate! It was so crispy and the flesh so tender and juicy that my friend ate the whole fish head. even the bones. I loved the cumi and chomped even on the head. which I hardly ever do. It was a satisfying dinner

22nd Sept 2017. Dinner for 4 adults & 2 kidsArrived 8.30pm. 4 other tables occupied by the sea.I called prior to confirm reservation but was not necessary, as they have seats available. They mentioned last order will be at 9pm and the restaurant closes at 9.30pm. Wow, that's early. We went anyway...Arrived at NSRCC Sea Sports Centre, parking is available but not much left. Walked a lil distance around the entrance down to the restaurant. The restaurant is spaced out with indoors and much more outdoor space which includes the sea view! Evening backdrop not too good, but the breeze was perfect. We sat at the outdoor perimeter not by the sea, as indoor was closed for an event though nothing is happening inside except some prepared buffet table. Maybe the event is tomorrow.We ordered at 8.35pm, food came punctually and we had dinner.The food tasted good. We ordered the packaged set and everything on the table tasted good. Though some dishes tasted more local than traditional, they were a good mix to give traditional a new taste. I must say the satay tastes close to the one I had in Jogja.The chendol is also good though I get different feedback from friends.Unfortunately, staff are poorly trained with no initiative. How about using a tray for 4 glasses of lemon tea than hand-carrying in between fingers. No spills but no ethics.They are helpful but needed supervision.After 9, they started to clean up the place & kept coming to clear bits here and there on our table. While having dinner & conversations, a staff will come over & start clearing plates. Sanitizing of indoor floors & cleaning starts before 9.30pm. The detergent smell will linger.By 9.30pm, it was my last table. Thank you for not switching off the lights. We left at 9.40pm as last guests.The most irritating part was the flights that took off from that runway behind. Every minute or 2, there will be an aircraft which takes off & blare their engines thru your ears. Simply irritating.My above rating includes the food, service, ambience & likelihood to recommend or return. I like the ambience and the good food. But service & blaring aircraft brings the experience down

Was there for dinner recently. The food and service was ok, except that while we were having our dessert, the staff started to mop the floor as if to shoo us away. The heavy smell of the cleaning liquid was too much for me. I had to rush out the door. What a way to spoil an almost pleasant dinner. It was just 9 pm then

Nice Seaview but lacking in good food and service. Despite the minimal crowd our drinks took 20 minutes to arrive. The honey glazed spring chicken was tasteless, hard and cold. Looks like it's been cooked 2 days ago. The only consolation was the deep fried gurame

Had patronized Gurame in the last 5 years. Thrice had New Year's Eve dinner, yesterday was there too for our New Year's Eve dinner of 2016.Previously invited friends to join us for a casual meal and they were surprised with the nice alfresco dinning, by the sea. My husband and I like the restaurant very much. No frills, simple al carte menu or set dinner. No alcohol is served but it's pretty alright. But friends said that it's a minus point. But they loved our recommendation.Yesterday had our reservation indoor because of year end rainy season. Was crowded both out door and indoor, staff were extremely busy. But we were well taken care of. Staff were polite, friendly and attentive. Twice, we were approached making sure our dishes were alright and if we wished to order dessert = Chendol. Food were served with 20 minutes even though it was crowded and YES, definitely, the taste remain the same all these years. Utterly Delicious.â˜º And love the sambal balacan. . Fiery but awesome!!It's a Halal certified Restaurant and last night there were couple of tables with extended Malay family outdoor.Highly recommended to couple, family and family with young children.Will be dropping by soon.

I had a great experience in Gurame Restaurant. The Gurame Goreng Fish was very delicious i wish i could have one of that every day :).The service was excellent , all the staff is very attentive and will take care of ur needs.Finding a sit next to the sea could be a bit difficult especially at dinner time or weekends. If you are a fish lover then this restaurant is definitely worth visiting.Dinner 29th Dec 201

Firstly, the Gurame (fried Indonesian fish) was actually very good, as was the vegetable and jackfruit accompanying dish.The setting should have been ideal, overlooking the beach on the East Coast BUT we weren't allowed to eat out on the boardwalk at lunchtime..... So, we sat under the vernadah at an old looking, massive round table that would seat a dozen people - there was 2 of us.It was busy, most probably because the restaurant is not easy to get to. There's no public transport, out of the way and sits next to a sailing club. We rode bicycles there.The service was efficient and friendly and like I said, the food was good. We had a Groupon voucher for our fish, otherwise it would have been expensive ($30 for the fish) for what was served.Disappointingly, watch out for the hidden charges - they charge for the emping (Indonesian crisps/snacks) and even for the moist hand towels !! Surprising and a little strange....Its decent but was made just average. We'll go elsewhere next time

The restaurant is located at the NSRCC Sea Sports Centre, which is really tucked away and only accessible with a car. 4 adults and 2 kids (aged 11 and 8) had lunch there today (they open at noon). The Gurama (fish) Goreng (fried) was beautifully presented and fried to a crisp so every part was edible ($30 for a fairly small fish). The kids enjoyed the Tahu Telur, cubes of tofu wrapped in a skin and fried and served with a side sauce of sweetened kicap manis like sauce with fresh chopped onions and chilli. The Sayur Lodeh (veg and tofu in a mild coconut curry gravy) was very tasty and a generous portion, as was the Beef Rendang. The waitor recommended the Sate Ayam (Chicken Satay) which was good sized chunks of chicken skewered and grilled with a side of thick peanut gravy. I felt the chicken was a tad under marinated, though the outside was tasty enough. The Ikan Pepes was tasty and aromatic. We rounded off the meal with delicious icy Chendol for dessert, loaded with sweetened red beans, green agar, fragrant coconut milk and gula melaka suger. It was too hot to sit out doors, but there was plenty of seats overlooking the sea, where students were taking wind surfing classes, and you have an unblocked view of the ocean, and the planes flying overhead, which may be a bit loud. Free open air parking is available. The staff were attentive and friendly

The food was okay, the atmosphere and staff nice. The location however is superb. Right at the shore and planes crossing over. We were here for a last meeting before heading to the airport.

Our first visit to Gurame restaurant, Changi Coast Walk. I wanted to bring my husband to a special place in Singapore to dine which is close enough from my parents' house. Heard about Gurame since I was young but never visited (I think it was previously located at East Coast?). Such a beautiful place, we were greeted by such wonderful sea breeze and the magnificent view of the sea. Staff were friendly enough, they were pleasant. Requested for outside seating and had a nice corner table as there were 5 of us (bigger area to accommodate the tables and chairs). Quite a range of dishes, we felt quite spoilt for choice! We ordered their (a-must!) signature Gurame bakar, honey-glazed chicken, ikan pepes, udang bakar and tahu telur - every single dish was scrumptious! The tahu telur is highly recommended, everything was cooked to perfection! The spice, the quantity (not too much) and quality - we can't fault it. We left the restaurant feeling very happy, such great ambience and superb food. Terima kasih (Thanks) Gurame for such a wonderful experience

Reservation was simple and straightforward. Requested for outdoor dining and was pleasantly received by attentive staff. Managed to get a seat at the corner that had the best seascape view during sunset. If you are into photography, this is the best seat on the house for portraiture at the golden hour. Sea breeze welcomes, comforts and reassures you as a constant companion throughout your dining experience.Selection was quite typical but lacked one of my favourites which was 'Dendeng' or beef jerky a la Indonesian. Food is not fiery but did make me mildly break a sweat due to my hiatus from spicy foods of late. But fear not, as requests can be made for milder versions. Food appreciation is rather subjective but nonetheless, I thoroughly enjoyed the Ikan Bakar (fish with a unique blend of spices as a marinade that retains the juices of the succulent fish after barbecuing), Cumi Bakar (barbecued squid), Rendang Sapi (spiced, tender beef in a coconut sauce with shallots), Terung Sambal (sautÃ©ed eggplant served with a chilli paste), Tahu Kipas (frittered bean curd skin wrap with moist, tender shrimp and chopped shiitake mushroom filling) and Tahu Telur (fried bag of bean curd with beaten egg, enjoyed with a unique sauce). The dessert of Chendol (gelatinous bits of chilled, pre-boiled, shredded rice flour called 'chendol', in a syrup of palm sugar and coconut milk with green bean, enjoyed with ice shavings), avocado milkshake made the Indonesian way and Es Teler (generous strips of jackfruit, young coconut meat and avocado, drenched in palm sugar and coconut milk, naturally scented with screw pine and topped with ice shavings). These desserts were eye-candies too in their own right, when they were served

We popped in for dinner and saw they had a set dinner for two for @$70 before taxes. It was quite empty when we got there at 6 but started filling up soon after. It was a nice evening so we decided to sit on the boardwalk to enjoy the sea breezes and to watch the aircraft landing at Changi every few minutes. Service was quite good and one of the waiters dropped by every so often to check on how we were doing. The best dish of the night was the fried fish, which we both thoroughly enjoyed. It was so crispy that you could even chew the bones and the fins. I also liked the sotong fried in sambal and the potato croquettes, as well as the sayoh lodeh. The kangkong vegetables were so-so, while the chicken was too bony and hard. The meal ended with chendol, which was a refreshing finish. If you are in the neighborhood, do drop by to enjoy the scenery and the deep fried gurame fish

Nice experience dining at the sea side. Enjoy breeze air from the sea and the sceneryWe order set menu for 2. Food taste nice, we like thair fried gurame, fried tofu (stuffed with prawn and veggetables), fried chicken, sayur lodeh and sauteed kang kongFood is quite pricey (more to buy the ambience the the food )Some staff not very attentive and really blurr when take order, but some is helpful and friendl

We visited this restaurant at 3.30 pm and it was almost empty which is surprising. The location is superb overlooking the sea with plenty of outside eating. It is less than 5 minutes walk from the busy centre where other eateries/Starbucks etc are and these were bustling with people. Perhaps it is because the restaurant hasn't a licence to serve alcohol. There was a selection of appetising,soft drinks/fruit juices which came with a bowl,of Indosean crisps. The menu was varied with chicken/fish/vegetarian options. The portions were big. The dishes came with symbols noting how spicy each was. The Nasi goreng was very tasty. The prices were very reasonable

I love Indonesian food, and try to sample as much as possible when in South-East Asia. Gurame (means 'peace' I have been told) serves excellent Indonesian food in a friendly (peaceful!) atmosphere with an amazing view on the Singapore Strait. I visited the restaurant for lunch during a week day, and it was very quiet. I have been told that in the weekends the restaurant can be extremely busy. It rained heavily during part of lunch, but I kept dry feet, and it was quite entertaining to watch the downpour. However, afterwards it was quite hard to get a taxi to drive me back to the city (the restaurant almost touches Changi airport, which is quite obvious during eating because of the huge aircraft overhead with a lot of noise

Went on a weekday for early dinner at around 615pm. At that time plenty of parking spaces. It is be the sea so the ambience is pretty nice if you dine alfresco. The service is mighty good but we were the only table. The food was served within 10 mins. The aubergine/eggplant sambal is really good. The keropok binjai comes with sambal....The sambal is really spicy so don't overdo it :p The sup bontot is not too bad. Could have a little more spices but the sambal prawns were a big disappointment. The sambal is not that nice and the worse of it is that the nice medium size prawns were way overcooked. Serving portion for prawns is big though, i think they have like 10 medium size prawns. Total bill came up to almost SGD70. A little on the high side but if the prawns turned out good, it would have been worth the money. This restaurant is halal.I would probably go back there so that i can dine by the sea but I won't be ordering any prawns though.

Visited Gurame Restaurant for my anniversary. The food was not too bad. A little pricey but the portion was good. The ambience was probably the best factor about the place and the staff were all friendly. The only complaint i have is about the dessert. We ordered the set meal for 2 and we had chendol at the end of our meal. However, the coconut milk was not fresh and it was 'cracked'. Seems like the dessert has been kept for awhile.
