I had jägerschnitzel, rum ball and freshly-brewed coffee. They were all GOOD, especially the coffee. I had never tasted coffee as good as this one.
I will be back for another schnitzel in early July 2017.

Had a decent lunch around Joo Chiat Place hunting for a caffeine fix. Found this place, half restaurant half bakery. Bakery was an interesting experience as you surrounded by the smell of freshly baked pastries. Had a freshly brewed coffee with a orange loaf....nice!

Excellent German Pork Knuckle and Pretzels.
Do check out the bakery section. These items are pretty good too.

We went for brunch on Singapore's National Day (9 August) and so we were the only customers around. We thus enjoyed a warm welcome from the owners there who took the time to talk to us and wish us a happy national day. The food was good, but we paid more than S$150 for 3 people which we felt was slightly expensive

Wernerâ€™s oven I found out about this place when I dine at chilli padi, the restaurant is located at Joo Chiat lane opposite Guan Hoe Soon restaurant, if you like German cuisine, well this place is for you. The menu is filled with lots of hearty German fare, from pork knuckles, sausages, schnitzel, and off course sauerkraut and potato salad, all food that we tried, we were impressed. We had a truly delicious meal which was very reasonably priced, the food was of excellent quality. The service staff were friendly and thoughtful, making our dining experience a memorable one. I shall return

Visited them twice years ago when they were at Upper East Coast. Although I love their food, especially the sauerkraut, pretzels, oxtail stew, sausages and pork knuckles; I stop visiting as the parking was a pain at Upper East Coast. Happen to spot them at their current location at Siglap, where they are across a huge carpark. I just have detour in (after a heavy dinner) to introduce my teenage kids to more authentic German style bread - they fell in love with the sugar coated "pigs ear" bread after 1 bite.I brought the family again for a full dinner a week later. The sauerkraut is definitely as great as I remember, better than other local finds. Dry, not mushy and just the right sweetness. Pork knuckle unlike other restaurants here is crispy and not oily. I like it better, though my wife prefer another restaurant's slightly juicier texture. Oxtail Stew is great. But definitely need to order more bread to accompany it. We enjoyed the cheese sausage too. Unlike other sausage where we typically get a burst of oily juice, these is just right. My fussy kids, voted we have to come back again. So we will return, especially parking is easy even on a Sunday evening peak.The bread/pretzel would better if they are slightly warm

Me and my wife came here for breakfast. Its cheaper than other restaurants in the area, however the food is quite mediocre. My wife's omlete came wothout bacon, when we asked about it, we were told that they ran out. The communication definitely needs improvement. The portions are decent.

This restaurant is 3 mins walk from my home. I am passionate about their home made breads, going there at least once a week. To me they serve one of the best breads in Singapore, for a very reasonable price too. They make their own sausages, they taste fresh and with the right amount of seasoning. You can buy their sausages to store in your home fridge for up to 3 months. The cooking is authentic as it can get, as the proprietor is married to a German. Last but not least, their pork knuckle does not disappoint.

Lovely welcoming place. Decent selection of German beer but not a very impressive long list. Slightly on the pricey side. No promotion for Oktoberfest.The sausages are absolutely fantastic. Highly recommend the Farmer Sausage. I thought about the knuckle but I noticed it is a fried knuckle and hence I did not order it.Brilliant selection of breads and puffs and pastries too. I will be back soon

Came straight from arriving at Changi Airport this evening to meet my local friend and his family for dinner tonight at Werner's Oven.A wide selection of German dishes to choose from - we had sauerkraut as side dish which to my surprise was the best of all...very simple - shredded cabbage with white onion - the dish was delicious...almost sweet.We ordered quite a few dishes - beef goulash soup, ox-tail soup, barlauchwurst sausage, two different type of schnitzels, chips, chicken steak, spaghetti bologniase, plus ice cream to finish off the night.All agreed that the dishes were just right - very filling.The staff were great, recommending as we asked questions - recommended

We enjoyed the German sausages. The crispy pork knuckle is to die for. The service was great and theowner friendly and chatty.

The trotter and sauerkraut is totally delicious! My favorite homely German restaurant in the east of Singapore.

Their homemade ham and sausages are delicious. You can either dine in or buy their frozen sausages to take home.
I especially love their chunky steak pie. Yummy to the max, especially when it's piping hot

This lovely little restaurant was a pleasant surprise find. We started out having a really good coffee and decided to have lunch after chatting with Susan the owners sister-in-law. I had the best croissant I have ever eaten. It was a wholemeal croissant with ham, cheese, tomato and lettuce. So fresh and enjoyable. The adjoining bakery sells beautiful breads. I also bought some cherry jam that is really good.

Have dined at Werner's a few times before it moved from Siglap to Joo Chiat quite a while ago, but have mixed experience at the lunch here today. The Schmorbraten came with a rather tough slice of beef, not just in one but 2 orders, though the taste and the bread dumpling side was good. The other members ordered the Sausages have much better experience as before, which we do buy them in pack from time to time for home cook. So it is better to stick to the Sausages to avoid disappointment

Went there with family of 3.I don't think restaurants actually get the idea of providing alternative dishes to the menu. It may be out of the restaurant specialty concept but it has to be done right.If it's in the menu, it should be done properly at least, no?Ordered carbonara as its the safest food to go with. Can't go wrong; or at least I thought.Carbonara was served with dry spaghetti, no sauce at all, scrambled eggs. It tasted like edible yellow rubber bands.All that on top of getting my order wrong. The restaurant wasn't full at all. Horrible, horrible, horrible

I haven't dined in as I come to Werner's to buy bread to take home. In Singapore, where bread is horribly soft and sweet and with no flavour, Werner's bread is a wonderful surprise. It reminds me of many of the continental bakers in Melbourne. The sough dough loaf if rich, sour and dense. It slices well and is delicious with anything. The kraftkorn is crusty and delicious. The small bread rolls are superb including the sun flower brot, the sesame, the spelt and the muesli rolls. We also took home 2 beef steak pies. Wow! Amazing baked pastry and the filling was tasty with perfect meeting of chunks and gravy. The prices are fine, especially compared to the expensive local soft and sweet rubbish. If you are a western expatriate in Singapore and you miss great bread, then I recommend Werner's oven. Importantly, the breads are baked and ready in the mornings which is also a rarity in Singapore

It wasn't THAT great. Sure it has some of German kuche stuff that everyone wants but I thought it was pretty expensive and overall wasn't too delicious. I was looking forward to the bretzel after not having it for months leaving Berlin. The Leberkase mit Brotchen was ok....but overall not in a rush to come back agai

Service is not great, but they are trying. Meatloaf sandwich is NOT like any meatloaf I've had, nor is it very filling. Looked like Spam, actually. Baked goods were very nice, pretzels, breads etc. Daughter loved the pancakes. Haven't been for dinner, price seems awfully high. German Beer

Food was okay, nothing special. I'd say, maybe 6.5 out of 10. Service was horribly slow. Had to wait a long time for food to arrive. My friends and I were all getting delusional. We had to buy a bit of bread from the bakery just to stave off hunger. There was only one guy taking orders and he also works the cash machine for the bakery. Two old ladies serve the food and sometimes get confused which food goes to which table.Even if I were craving German food, I'd most probably not come back here just because it's that slow. Okay, maybe I'll come back for the bread
