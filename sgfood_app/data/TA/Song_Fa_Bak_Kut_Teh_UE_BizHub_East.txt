Love the pork meat tender and fall of the bones with a pepper broth which is refillable. Best eaten with white rice or flour fritters and with salted vegetables and braised nuts

Was around the area of expo for the food fair and decide to drop in for a meal. Service was efficient and friendly with non stop replenishment of soup whenever needed.

The dishes were all good. We had pork ribs, braised peanuts, youtaio,pork belly and vegetables. Service was good even with the lunch crowd. Worth coming back.

Song Fa. It never fails each time we visit. It like comfort food. You dream of cooking an exact duplicate at home and you thought you were successful. Then you visit Song Fa to have a good bowl of soup and how different the authentic one is.It never fails, never! Would surely be back again and again

If you shopping around Changi, this will be a fantastic place to stop by and have one of the best Bak Kuk teh in town.Service is great, plenty of side dishes to pick from and you can accompany your Bak Kuk teh with either rice or congee.Perfect

A delightful Asian food experience in the business district of Changi Business Park. Get there early as it is a very busy restaurant with an atmosphere loaded with hustle, bustle and people enjoying great food and chatting about the morning's work. Very well priced and a great range of Singaporean and Chinese influenced dishes are on offer and served efficiently by attentive staff

Visited this Bak Kut Teh when I saw diner commented "one of the best". The fact is, it really is. The soup tastes mildly not like some other soup with a lot of pepper. Suitable for light taste diners. Environment is good. I visit ard 8pm weekday, no queue. Open office hour. A few diners left after 9.15pm. Must go there in time to enjoy the dinner. Wet tissue is given by default @ 20 cents.I don't understand why there are some genius diners think highly of this restaurant yet rate 4-star in the end... the price is market rate, environment is good, taste is yummy. Guess if this rest offer half price these cheapskate will probably rate 5-stars..

Bak Kut Teh literally translates to pork bone tea. It's a dish found only in Singapore, Malaysia and some parts of Thailand and Indonesia. It's one of the dishes visitors to Singapore should try. There are various versions of Bak Kut Teh. Song Fa serves the mildly peppery version. Although the main dish is port ribs in soup, there are other dishes such as pig trotters, intestines, peanuts, youtiao (fried dough), vegetables etc. Eat with rice or mee sua (thin noodles). I prefer mee sua.The correct way to eat Bak Kut Teh is to drink Chinese tea. Please do not order coke or other soft drinks. It's nice to try making Chinese tea yourself st the table! Ask for help if needed. I like this particular restaurant for its variety and ambience. Expo MRT is just next door, although currently construction works mean a detour to get round the construction.

First time there, the service was quite good. Service: They are friendly and they are very coordinated when comes to serving. The food was good. The atmosphere is very welcoming. When we got there, it was not busy (5pm) and when it hit 6pm, the place is already full. I came with my parents and the older folks like it a lot. Pricing is reasonable. Pork soup at SGD7. If you do not want pork, you can opt for fish in bakkutei soup! My favourite of all is the lemon jelly dessert, so refreshing and nice! The tea experience was great too and the best part of all is, despite we have finished our food, the people do not rush us away (despite there was a Q outside) they did not clear our plates (you know some places, they cleared all your plates and cups and you have no choice and feel embarrassed for seating there and have to leave unless you need to order more?). They did not rush us off. This is the BEST part that I like because that means, we could enjoy the tea and have a proper good conversation with my parents. I totally appreciate the gesture and I think they know that we want to spend time with parents, family and hence we choose this place. My bill was over a hundred because we ate a lot and I brought two boxes of bakkutei packets home and sent to overseas for my friends! The staffs are well coordinated, well verse, helpful, knowledgeable and the place is inviting for family and friends. Overall it was a good experience

No need to wait too long for a seat and food was served pretty fast as well. The staff also promptly refill the soup too. Thumbs up.

This is my go-to place for bak kut teh (pepper just Pork rib bone broth). prices are less than $10 per dish. the braised Pork legs are very good too. must try if u are around the area.

Song Fa Bak Kut Teh is no stranger to most local bak kut teh lovers in Singapore as it has been around since 1969. The branch that I most frequent is the one at Changi Business Park. The staffs there are generally helpful and friendly and they work like a big family. Great food and good service. Please continue the way it is

I frequent this restaurant often as it is close to where I work. My favourites are the Lean meat Bak Kut Teh which is also easy for the kids to eat. Most shop sells only the ribs which are difficult to eat for kids.Recommended to go before 12pm to avoid the crowd

Really great. We got a business dinner on Friday night after a good week of working. That's really a great place for casual business dinner with real great local food.All foreigners must try this local food. Sure I'll go again each time I'm in Singapore

We have a quick dinner in Song Fa nearby changi expo area. This chain restaurant is Gd in food as well as the decorations.You can have Gd local Chinese style the pork soup(strong pepper taste) with unlimited refilling.You can find Gd food with fair price in here, we ordered several dish n Billed for 30SGD. It is Gd to try the pork soup here if you have no idea which one is Gd in SIN

Had lunch and ordered the pork loin soup as the pork rib soup was not ready. Also ordered Xiao bai cai and the youtiao. The soup was good and refillable but the prok meat was quite tough. Had to pay the bill once food food is delivere

whenever in Singapore, we never fail to visit Song Fa.the soup is like bottomless :D and the pork is always very tender. i just can't copy it hahahawhat i love about them is that they sell bah kuh teh mix. it's almost the same taste :) but of course, song fa makes it even more delicious. you may not need the dark soy.be sure to inform the staff if you're using the wet towels because you will be charged for it

A great place to enjoy some local fare if you do not want to go in to the city. After a long day at the exhibition, you just need to fill up with good wholesome food and get back to the hotel for a rest, getting ready for the next day..

I was never a fan of Bak Kut Teh, but after the first time I ate at Song Fa, I was hooked. I love the bowl of soup, which is constantly refilled, and the very tender meat. I usually eat that paired with salted veggies and a bowl of rice.Although the place (at Changi Business Park) is usually full, we haven't really had to wait for long. Besides, it's worth the wait
