A meal for five. Good Choice. Excellent service. Well looked after by staff. Staff helpful. A three course meal for 5 adults came to $65.85
The fried fish and the fish curry is excellent

Food here is good and specially the chicken biryani. For $7, they serve a good biryani. Do try out the other dishes as well that are on display :)

The food here was not bad. But about 2 hours afterwards the effects of MSG kicked in.
So unless you are used to that then you will be fine. Otherwise you will feel yuck all night.

A set vegetarian meal is your best option. Avoid the mithai..they do not have the faintest idea about Indian mithai. They serve Idli, Dosa etc., after 3:00 pm. The cook is good, but cannot fry chapati's. You will end up with under-cooked chapati. Better to stick to South Indian cuisine.
