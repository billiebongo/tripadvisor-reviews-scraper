I brought my family for a dinner at Spicy house to celebrate birthday of my dad and daughter. My family love the hotpot and customer service.

Overall good. Food quality is good except the sliced fish. Need to improve their service to create a good customer experience.

Fresh food such as fish slices, meatballs. Soup is too salty and wont feel thirsty even after drinking plenty of soup!

The taste of spicy soup base is not stable. Fish slice is fresh and wonderful. Good serviceï¼Œand nice environment.

Mala soup was too salty and oily. The kampung chicken soup was too bland. Not well balanced. However, 2nd same dish offering 50% so make up for the taste.

Located at Clearke Quay. Accidentally went in for a late night dinner. The table is equipped with induction cooker and they put some spicy waters there to boil. we can order raw items and can cook ourselves. I must say the food is spicy as hell. But super tasty. It's a kind of experience to have and the staff is quick, kind and attentive. Can surely recommend this place

Spicy House Restaurant Located at #01-07 Riverside Point, 30 Merchant Road, at Clarke Quay. Spicy House is the first overseas outlet of a restaurant chain originating in Shanghai. It is a stylishly furnished Chinese restaurant with tastefully ambience, that's found a home on the First floor of Riverside Point. Provides a very comfortable dining environment with private VIP rooms catered for private events. It is a distinctive but good up-market Shanghainese Chinese restaurant Good service, tasty consistent food, with trace of Sichuan-style cuisine combination origins dishes. What we really love about the exquisite mouthwatering Chinese cuisine is the usage of fresh, premium ingredients. Some of The food that we ordered such as Chengdu-style hotpot were all tasty and well presented. The price tags are definitely high, but I guess that is the way in Singapore everything is quite inflated. Lastly, thumbs up to the service Staff are very professional the service is excellent and very friendly and attentive. A perfect night. I would highly recommend, I will definitely come back. Very soooon. Awesome!!

We chose this restaurant because it was jst across our hotel, it had a nice view om the canal and it was empty. We sat outside, service was very good, food was ok, not the best hotpot I have ever had and quality compared to price is not the most convenient. Portions were on the small side. What saves this restaurant is the location. I don't think I would go back

Came here for company causal dinner. This is a chain from China. This restaurant has been in Singapore for less than a year. The crowd is not very big.Hotpot soup - We ordered thing Mala soup and the pig trotter collagen soup.There is a sauce and fruits bar which one can eat all you can at 4 dollars per pax, which I think is ridiculous. Mala soup came with mild, spicy and super spicy level. We went for spicy level.We also ordered the small lobster. This was YUMMY!!! This dish was very aromatic and very spicy. One down thing is that this is very difficult to eat. But the sauce was OMG. I could eat 2 bowl of rice with this sauce. The pig trotter soup was good too. It was a wise choice. And I have to say the soups were of good quality as none of us felt thirsty after the meal.The ingredients were fresh. Overall a very good experience. But for the price we are paying, I think the overall service experience could be better. Of course I am comparing this to the well known Hai Di Lau who splurge their customers w great services
