All things LATAM - Empanadas, Pisco, Cachaca, Tequila. With great tunes and a dimly lit ambience. Need I say more?

Food is not remotely similar to South American. Average price level for Singapore. Drinks and service ok.

Great atmosphere every time I visit. Beautifully lit, excellent soundtrack and the food and beverage is unmissable.
5
Delicious food at a good price. Fun laid back atmosphere, wonderful for date or with friends. Excellent cocktails. Will be back.

The food was great, I had scallop ceviche and chicken skewers, both were delicious and so fresh. The drinks are all amazing and the staff were all lovely. A really nice vibe.
5
Loved the drinks, the food and the service staff. The atmosphere was brilliant. Totally recommend Vasco, you will be pleasantly surprised!
5
Great drinks, amazing attentive service. Wait staff were checking as soon as anything was done and went out of their way to make us feel welcome.

We popped by whilst in Chinatown for Beers, and were warmly welcomed by a very nice Danish guy who made us feel at home. We felt even more when sampling the toilet facilities, and found ourselves welcomed by a virtual toilet buddy, greeting us and eagerly chatting along whilst sampled. Almost spooky at first, but was quickly more on the funny side.A vast beer selection kept us all happy, and if we were to move on to tequilas, we would no doubt be equally happy!A Perfect spot for that unlimited full latin American drinking experience!!!Go there!

We started with cocktails, then had a few sharing plates and 3 mains. We were waiting for the 3rd main when they realised they'd forgotten to key in one and were very apologetic. We'd already eaten our fill so were not fussed about it at all, but they insisted on comping us a couple of free drinks and dessert to make up for it, which was really nice. Order the lamb empanadas and the cubanitos, they're delicious

My friends and I went to Vasco during the Cocktail Fest weekend and this place hands down was the highlight of the weekend! Full of energy and so much fun! The pisco sours were very nice, and the Cola Pollo was delicious!
5
Amazing bar and bar team! If your in Singapour it's a must check out venue, the pisco sours are to die for!
5
Great place to get cocktail and strong drinks....good music and cosy seating. Wide spread of drinks are available
5
We went for cocktails and dinner. The cocktails are great and there was a big selection. The food was great, especially the okra and cola marinated chicken. The staff were really informative and attentive. Will definitely go back.
5
Love the "hand of god" cocktail and the food was delicious. Pleasant staff which gave us good recommendations.
4
Really better than a tacos bar, very good food from differents latinos countries with super cocktails!
5
Commencing with their choice cocktail concoctions are an assured appraisal, palatable indeed!
Bill of fare was impressive, dishes on hand were recommended by the highly knowledgeable staff on hand, conclusively exquisite!
5
A great place to pop by for a drink (or two). My friends and I popped by during a bar hop and really enjoyed the vibe! Great music. And I love the surprise 'language lesson'...(you have to get there to know what I'm talking about! - I wouldn't want to spoil the surprise!

Definitely a hidden gem in my opinion - food at Vasco is good. We had a ceviche and empanadas for starters. In my opinion, ceviche could have a bit more depth to it (or maybe I am used to the lime version) and the empanadas could have a thinner crust, the filling was absolutely delicious, served with hot sauce for that oomph. For mains we had the chicken and steak. Chicken was ok but we both preferred the steak with chimichurri. It was done medium to our liking. We also enjoyed the passion fruit crumble - I wish they had more crumble on top. The prices for food were value for money in comparison to other restaurants as portions were larger than we are used to.The cocktails on the other hand were excellent and worth the money. Pina coladas, girl from Ipanema and I can't remember the two others we had - they were all really good and on the money.I also commend on the service staff here, staff always checked in to make sure we were happy. We will definitely be bac

One of the best places to go for drinks in the city with really cool music and amazing booths for a cozy little corner with friends. The drinks are some of the most balanced and eclectic flavours and the bar team knows their stuff. You can get a background story on every one of their specialty spirits from the friendly owner/manager who is there almost all the time.The food is super simple and great for snacking. The empanadas are piping hot and the spinach and cheese or the spiced lamb are a steal at $1 on monday
5
Loved it!! A "must-visit" in Singapore. My boyfriend had a coconut tasting drink - the best drink eveeeeer :-) Also try Tommys Magarita
4
we bumped to this very charming and lively taps pas. The owner and all the staff are giving you the best welcome and hospitality you can get. Food is South American, taps style, and cocktail are great. Try the Pisco Sour.
5
The restaurant wasn't too difficult to find and the service was very prompt. It could be the day of the week but i have faith that they would still be as consistent even with a crowd. I'll definitely be back

Good cocktails. Food was average. Not at the standard of FOC up the road but over time I suspect they will get better. Hong Kong st is transforming into a cool street in Singapore
5
Visited several times over last couple of months, Great work to Christian and his team, great fun and great cocktails!!
4
We came here for late night drinks. They have food tapas style and drinks. Had the prawns which was quite good. I had the pina colada which was far too sweet to be drinkable. Very loud music which got louder throughout the night.
3
A very precious hidden place.food was perfectly fine especially the chicken( but i forgot the name its in main menu) you can taste the juiciness of chicken, but for the Argentinian beef much better if they will put the salsa in a bowl rather on the top of beef, cause you can taste the saltiness of salsa.overall it was good food, good place and good people.keep it up:)like the ambiance
5
We came to Vasco after dinner for a few drinks, and after having a few really nice cocktails and a perticulerly nice Pisco Sour, we decided to come back and try the food. We were not disappointed. Vasco has a nice casual atmosphere, good for a drink (or few) as well as a nice place for dinner with Friends.
4
We had a gala time sampling the vast range of cocktails on the menu. Food was awesome too. We had too much starters that we never made it to the main course. Music was awesome throughout the night and the wait staff was attentive and courteous. The place wasn't very packed so it was a nice venue to catch up with friends and chit chat over dinner and drinks

We were waited immediately on arrival by a tall good looking gentleman. Great start to our evening. Fortunately my husband has great sense of humour. The daiquiri is spot on ! Well bodied and straight to your head. That's what I like. Not too impressed with the mojito though. Lack of punch. Kinda diluted. Somehow mojito in tall glass just don't sit well. Keeping it in short would better retain its favour. First dish is Quiabos. Came in a delicate bucket. Simple and tasty. Not flash as it intended to. Reminds me of Peranakan (Straits Chinese) salad. Cordero is rich and well flavored with a hit of cumin, mildly. The lamb is exquisitely tender. The pastry is light and well excuted though I prefer them to be fluffy. The highlight of the night is El Cubano. Oh my god. It is packed with juicy flavor and every bite is pure heaven to me. You get to savor mutiple taste from the juicy pork, crisp sweet cabbage and savory ham with cheese not forgetting the pickles.Good thing often comes in small package and true to it's word. Petite and delicious. Sweet, crumbling and subtle taramind lingers - Crumble dr platanoA perfect meal and a lovely night out. In total between two of us we had 6 cocktails apart from our dinner. The only concern I have is the table is too tight to fully enjoy an appropriate feast. You need to clear your dish to accommodate your extended orders. It kind of a kill joy for people who really love their food and love to see various dishes on their table. Food is relatively well priced. Not too expensive. Cocktail is a little steep for my threshold. Our menu of the night as follows. Quiabos-ladies fingers flash fried with garlic, chilli and saltCordero - slow roasted lamb, toasted cumin seeds and red wine and chiiliEl Cubano - slow roasted pork shoulder sandwich, smoked ham,benne tap cheese, red cabbage coleslaw house made picklesCrumble dr platano - banana and passion fruit crumble with taramind creme anglais

The empanadas and Cuban sandwich were amazing. We had the snapper ceviche and that was average. Good drinks menu, albeit relatively expensive. Will return for the empanadas and the Cuban sandwich.
5
Delicious food, great cocktails and wonderful service. A bit on the pricey side but worth every dollar.
4
Very good food. But very noisy envoierment. If the place is busy like very busy it is just too loud.
4
Vasco was perfect for Saturday night dinner with friends. A great cocktail list, friendly service and great atmosphere.
4
Good service and food. Excellent drinks.
The cola chicken was really the winner for me. Thoroughly enjoyed our visit.
4
This place is ace for its ambience and great music that isn't playing too loud like in other places. Great place for Latin American inspired cocktails, and also good food! Hands down the cubano won me over! The sides and starters were served in larger portions than expected though, so my dinner partner and I could not finish the food :( Other than that, the staff are really attentive and make you feel completely at ease. Great job guys!

Just 10 months old, Vasco prides itself as Singapore's first Latin American Bar in Singapore. It was bustling with expats on a Friday night and it's no wonder it's so popular! With no whiskey and gin in their drinks, and a South American menu and Salsa music blasting, you definitely don't feel like you're in Singapore! Service was efficient and prompt despite the throngs of customers there. The Danish owner even gave us free cocktail shots! We had a great time there in our booth seats and although it was a little noisy (it is a restaurant/bar after all) everyone had a great time. Will def be back

We loved the food and cocktails at Vasco - everything was delicious. We were there on a Tuesday night so the place was a little quiet. It it had a few more customers, would've been great ambience. Service was also very attentive. Will definitely recommend Vasco!
4
Food was good, atmosphere was also great, you don't have to scream your head off just to get yourself heard over the table, so that was a plus point. I particularly liked the el chapo shots. Nice kick to end dinner with. pfft, what's with sweet wines, chilli shots are perfect.
4
Great ambience, lots of awesome varieties of cocktails, great service and great food! The portion of the food was pretty big though, I suggest to order it for sharing. If you like to drink something sour, I suggest to order the acai favela, santiago sour, and pisco sour. Del monte cartel was not bad either, it has pinch of black pepper in it. It was very different but it tastes good. And cuppa juan, for those who love espresso and rum :) If I come back to Singapore again, I will definitely visit Vasco again
4
Good food, good atmosphere, great service, excellent cocktails, very noisy table of locals beside us but that's no fault of their own! Excellent!
5
great host, great cocktails, tasy food, great atmosphere what more can you want all round fantastic place to have a good night out
3
Good for drinks but their food was very average.We had the sandwich and steak which was very average. Dont bother with their food
4
Staff was very friendly and accommodating. Food was good, though the menu is a little limited - was expecting more tapas options. Drinks were great and loved the atmosphere.
5
I have visited Vasco with two friends on a Wednesday evening. The place was vibrant the cocktails and food was great I would highly recommend we pretty much tried every dish on the menu and couldn't fault it at all. Great value for money as well we were stuffed at the end.
4
I went for a quick drink in the early evening. Interesting cocktails but the wine list was a little disappointing. The food we had (spinach and cheese empanadas as well as meatballs) were better than expected and a cut above much of the bar food you tend to get in Singapore. Very friendly service
5
Stopped here for a quick dinner date with my Super amazing Boyfriend. The atmosphere was laid back and the ambiance was date material ❤️ We had the snapper which was delightfully tangy and the chickens skewers. The chicken was very moist and scrumptious! Check this place out for a sumptuous bite and good company
5
First, the staff was excellent: i was late for more than 40 mins, calling to extend and reserve my reservationz in which they did. Second, there was always smile on the staff and it was a very warming experience. Food portion was very good for tapas and the cocktails was very delicious. Would definately go back again despite the slightly high price
5
Where to start???, this place is still a hidden gem, the details in the decoration of this place plus the ambient music (a mix of different Latin music styles) takes you to a bar in any latinamerican city. The small and compact menu is a great mix of Latin food and everything we tasted was super delicioso and cooked perfectly... And the cocktails we tasted were great. Finally the service was the kind of service that just makes you smile since you enter the place and the bartenders greet you, the girls serving the tables are so nice and even the chef came out to greet us and have a short chat. One of the best restaurants and meals we have visited.

The last five years or so has seen quite an explosion in trendy places seeking to break the mold and do something different. Unfortunately these well meaning efforts often fall a bit flat and so I've learned to temper my expectations. In fact thought this was on my list to try I had been lazy about making it out to. These guys really pull it off though. Cool ambiance, check! Though I felt the lighting in the back area away from the bar was still a bit too bright. Music was nice and gave the right feel. Attentive staff, check! The various wait staff that attended to us all were there when they needed to be, were efficient and executed their duties well. Great drinks, check! These guys pride themselves on building their cocktails around two prominent spirits from the region: Pisco and Cachaca (sorry my keyboard doesn't type the funny c). I was extra impressed to find that the particular bottles they choose really have an outstanding character--that taste that makes Cachaca different and special shines through the rest of the flavors. And lastly, the food, check! Just about everything we ordered was great. We ordered the empanadas, both the spinach as well as the lamb. The lamb was fantastic, we wanted to order more but already had a lot of food coming. The spinach was also very good but could perhaps use a little more excitement. We also had the Okra, the Chicken Pinchos and the Snapper Ceviche. All great. I don't know what the put on the Okra but it was so tasty. Lastly was the El Cubano sandwich. So tasty. Vegetables fresh in taste, with the toothsome snap. Pork and saucy accompaniments tangy and savory and just yummy. Bread covering toasty just right. I really was so impressed. The only suprise was that these guys weren't jam packed as they should be. Don't miss this place
