My wife and I went for lunch and I choose the greek salad and the olio pasta.
My greek salad was served with 1 single olive, one piece of cheese and 2 small piece of cucumber...I think they could have done better...

I’ve been here a few times in the past and while the food is passable the service was so-so. There was a very nice service lady but now she’s gone it’s just terrible. We arrived early before the crowds but it took for ages to be asked if we wanted a drink. After we finally got a waiters attention and ordered (they specialise in looking over and around you even if the whole table is waving) they brought the wrong food / wine on three occasions. One of our party waited over an hour for a cup of tea. After 2 requests to clear empty plates we finally gathered the plates together and brought them back to the counter. It will be the last time my colleagues and I eat there.

Want something completely average ? Mediocre your thing ? Like impersonal service ? Then this is the the place for you ! Service is slow, food was kinda tasteless, service staff seem disinterested. Honestly there are much better choices out there.

We placed our order for 2 adults and 1 child at about 7pm. We were kept waiting for an hour despite pleading with the staff to at least serve the child menu first. The 2 main courses arrived at around 820pm and yet the child menu wasn't served. Good thing we managed to keep the little happy with a donut from Bread Talk next door (the WC staff didn't even attempt to serve some light apps to sooth nerves) and ended up sharing our food as we cancelled the last order. $75 for a terrible experience. I knew Wine Connection's food is bad (the pizza - are you kidding me??) but this takes it to a whole new level

Wine connection is the proof of a very inconsistent restaurant.I will never go there again I went there few times already but today was the end for me. I order their cheese and cold cut platter, the cheese was very old and disgusting, the cold cut were dry with almost no flavor and the bread was horribly dry from few days ago for sure! I will never recommand this place to anyone, there is thousands of better restaurant in Singapore. Shame on you to charge for such rubbish food

One of my other favorite place to come to dine with family, friends or just solo. Wide range of wines, sparkling wines and food. You can choose to be seated either in their air-condition area or go alfresco. Get really busy at dinner and towards the weekend.
4
It's hard to find good restaurants in the east, where you can have a drink and chill with friends.Wine connection is a great place. They have a good selection of decently priced wine. However not much variety of food but the food is cooked fast, so u don't end up waiting.The restaurant has a good ambience and gets very cramped on weekends and sadly they don't take reservations as well.Only advice to the management is to increase the selection and portions on starters/platters.Will definitely recommend this place and will return

Had a solo lunch here on a business trip. I enjoyed the burrata and the pizza together with a glass of white wine. The atmosphere was nice and the food quality was very good. If I am back in the area I will repeat the restaurant choice

I live around here and frequent the restaurants in the building quite often. Wines are very cheaply priced. But you need to be lucky to land a good bottle. Some are just horrible. But you can only blame yourself for choosing a bad wine. Food wise is nothing special, the joint next doors serves better food though! Service is pretty decent and you can have a good time with friends without burning a big hole in your wallet
5
Great food and wine at competitive price for Singapour . We had steaks and salad , dessert and cheese platter.. Good recommendation of Italian wine . The staff was very nice and welcoming . Only improvement could be on the size of the side... Good recommendatio
5
Been here several times. Steak is good, very good value/worth. Order a medium or medium rare steak. Very tender. Pizza is also good
4
Good place for pizza, pasta and other western food. The tuna salad was superb. Good value for money and the place is crowded especially during weekends.
4
any of the Wine Connection restaurants are good value. Best prices you will find for wine in Singapore for a wide range of wine.
4
This is a great wine bar if you want to share a table outside with friends, open a couple of well priced (for Singapore) bottles and chat the night away. While the venue itself is quite boring in its design and layout, the bench seating is comfortable and the atmosphere always has a nice buzz of happy customers.My friends and I general stick to the charcuterie boards and cheese plates, maybe share a gambas alioli, but leave it at that, the restaurant has disappointed at this price too many times to be worth staring from what we know works again.But, pls don't let that be too much of a negative, order some wine, break bread with friends tell some stories and let the good time flow
4
A busy restaurant offering a wide range of foods and an extensive wine list. Wine is very expensive in Singapore but this restaurant had a reasonably priced ( comparatively) list. The menu was quite extensive with a broad range of options. We were 4 adults and each found something they were very happy with. Staff were attentive and helpful. A great start to the food delights of Singapor
4
We had a nice outdoor table in the corner of the covered terrace. We started with yummy Prosecco. The menu consists of European favourites (so don't expect something extraordinary) and quality of food is very good, especially looking at price/quality. We had the surf and turf to share and a chorizo pasta. The kids loved their fish and chips. Lemon tart for desert was nice too. We will definitely come bac
4
The food was exceptionally good, without a doubt. The wine was excellent. We enjoyed the food and the wine thoroughly. The service, though, not so much! To begin with when we were waiting at the entrance to ask for a table, the staff who was at the counter near the entrance didn't bother to come up to us to ask anything. She continued her work and even answered phone calls to Reserve tables but didn't bother to check if we needed a table. My Husband had to enter the restaurant and ask her for a table, after which she entered inside, checked and advised us that the table will be ready in 3 mins. No doubt the restaurant was extremely crowded, which I understand, it was lunch time and it was Father's Day. On being seated we were given a menu. However for the longest time no staff bothered to come back to take the order. They walk around pretending that they cannot see that you are looking for help, seeming extremely preoccupied/busy. After a lot of effort to get some to take the order, the same waitress who gave us the menu came to ask us what we need, I asked her if she has a kids menu. She answered yes they did. And once again she disappeared. No sign of getting a kids menu. Again after a lot of effort, we got her attention, and reminded her. She then brought the kids menu to us. Once we decided on our choices we had to go through the same effort to get someone to take our order. Once the food arrived it was all ok. However I must state that they missed serving us once of the sides we had ordered. When the bill arrived they hadn't charged for the missed item in our original order which makes me believe that the staff who keyed in our order didn't punch it in their system. If I have to discount the service, I enjoyed the food and wine for sure. Not sure if I'd visit again
4
Wine Connection is a great value for money when it comes to wine selection & beef tenderloin ;)The prices are correct, the service is prompt, the place is clean, and the meat is very very very good.Great place to enjoy a good dinner with friends over a glass of red wine (or two... bottles actually !
4
One of the best steaks I've ever had. A little pricey but very good value due to the great quality. Great service too. Don't let the fact it is in a mall put you off
4
It's kind of sad that they won't take reservations after 7pm though. Nonetheless, we managed to make one at 7pm and reach a little over 5mins late.We were initially served by what seems like a trainee (no issues there). Although she wasn't aware of what was Wine of the Month (she had to ask the manager to come to my table eventhough the poster was just outside).As me and my partner both had ordered steaks (one being medium-well and the other medium-rare), he wanted to be sure when we were served so we had asked the waitress of our done-ness again when served. However, she didn't seemed like she understood what we meant as she said both were well-done. But another senior staff came to clarify that it was indeed how we had ordered it (medium-well and medium-rare).Although it was a bit of an awkward start to our experience, there was a nice chinese lady that served our wine which made up for the entire night. She was really friendly and knowledgeable about her wines and shared her experiences with us. She ensured that our wines were how we wanted it and that our food was paired up well. I really have to thank that particular lady (she brought a trainee with her when she opened our wine bottle) for making things less awkward. If I were to come back, would definitely look for her again.Overall, a lovely dinner celebrating International Women's Day with my women.Thank you Chinese lady for being so lovely
4
The restaurant has a nice and relaxing atmosphere. The menu has a good variety of food. They have a great 2 for $18 lunch deal. It is reasonably priced. The portions are on a smaller side though, so I would not recommend comong here if you are super hungry
5
I really enjoyed going there and it's my first time dining alone at wine connection bistro I12 katong. The food was great and thank you so much to Moose( if I got the name right) for pairing the wine and he shared with me his knowledge on the wines to pair with my food. Hope I could dine in again and talked to Moose about more wines with him. Thanks again. Will be back soon
5
Went there with a group of friends. Great choice of wines and very affordable compared to other places. Food very good quality. Not very big portions though. The waitress called Sarah was a superstar - great service with a smile and constantly had our water glasses refilled - something that most other restaurants can learn from! (I.e. Recent visit at the straits time restaurant- had to help myself from the service station as they couldn't be bothered to fill our waters). Thanks Sarah from wine connection! Much appreciated.
5
To my wife and I this has become our favourite hangout place, good food, great service, love the vibe. Everytime we visit we are impressed and love going back there. Highly recommend it for going out with friends, like it that there are inside and outside seating. Love the variety on the menu
1
I found the staff unprofessional and apathetic. The Restuarant was poorly run and overall this created a very poor experience.The food and wine are good although the concept of starters has passed this Restuarant by as they arrived after the main cours
3
This places serves coffee house type of food but with very reasonably priced wine.Ambience is ok. Service is good
4
We had our New Year's Eve dinner here. Food was good. Service was excellent. Will definitely come back again.If you are looking for Western food in this area, this place will not disappoint you.We ordered Bread Basket, Tuna Salad, Seared Seabass Filet and Surf & Turf Platter 2. Drinking water is free, and the staff keeps topping up the water all the time
5
We have been there two nights in a row. After being in Singapore for 3 weeks I was craving a steak. As much as I enjoy all the Asian food here including regular visits to the Hawker markets and a variety of other restaurants I was really looking froward to the steak.The prices were very reasonable for the calibre of restaurant it is and similar if not cheaper than many Australian restaurants. Their most expensive steak $26. I ordered this after a conversation with the waiter and I was not disappointed.The steak was cooked exactly to my liking and it melted in my mouth. There was so much flavour and I savoured every mouthful.I would have to say this is the best restaurant steak I have ever had - possibly supporting the theory that Australia's export market gets some of our best steaks.Five of us went back to the restaurant again last night and everyone of us ordered the steak. No one was disappointed and everyone said they will be back again for another before we go back to Australia.If you want a great steak this is definitely the place to go.They all have an extensive wine list - prices are reasonable.The table service was excellent
5
The customer service and food here is awesome!! Ppl to look out for: Sarah she is fantastic! She took care of us like a pro (ps we are amaeteurs in wine drinking!)Tina sweet gal who is very polite and service orientated and finally Monica who called me to find out about the status of my booking. I could not reply to the email on time n she called me to find out whether i am coming. Thumbs up!
5
We popped in here because we were caught in the rain but we were very pleased we found this place. The food and service was excellent. My steak was cooked to prefection and my lava cake was excellent. We will be going here again before the end of our trip that is for sure.
5
Thanks Simon for the great service! Thanks for the suggestions for our selection. Love their chocolate cake the most!
5
I really enjoyed the food like gambas. Thanks to the friendly and attentive staff especially Ms. Monica.
5
The place has great food and great wine.
Thank you for the woman who serves us, Monic.
Will be back soon.
5
Simon is always friendly and attentive. Thanks for the great service therefore a enjoyable dining 😊

Another perfect place
Good food
Good wine
Good friends
Good times
Flawless experience
Definitely coming back again.
:) :) :)
5
What a great experience to visit this place with a very accommodating staff and amazing food and wine served! It deserves to be recommended for friends and relatives to try visiting it.
5
It's an amazing experience to dine-in in this restaurant. Great food and wine are served. It is commendable to be experienced not only by my family but also by everyone, and for sure, they won't regret trying this place where the people are also nice.
5
We frequent this location often as it is just down the street from our house. It makes for an easy dinner when we want a delicious meal with great service. This night was made even more exceptional because of the quick response time of Yani, our server for the night. We had a time constraint and she was very attentive but never rushed. Thanks, Yani!! We will definitely be back
5
My friend and I are a regular at Wine Connection. We love coming here because of the amazing food and ambiance. What really adds up to the coziness of the place are the warm table attendants, like Sarah. Today, we brought in a friend and she (as expected) fell in love almost instantly! Kudos to the whole Wine Connection Team at Katong. Definitely coming back.
5
The food is very presentable and up to my liking. Ordered the Spaghetti Carbonara followed by Chocolate Brownie. Both equally delectable. Chosen the RosÃ© wine and it was splendid complement to the dishes.Service there is excellent. Staff by the name of Monica is very helpful and has good upselling skills. Another staff by the name of Yani attended to me regularly throughout my meal and serves with a smile. Water was refilled and plates were cleared quickly. There is also a guy who seems like the manager in charge called Richard who delightfully recommended me options in the desserts menu. It is very pleasant to have so many staff engaging to me.The ambience is very nice and quiet. Definitely would recommend this spot for those who love to wine and dine or looking for a cozy relaxed place to eat
4
Great place to meet with friends and try out something new. Good setting with really superb service by knowledgable staff. Totally enjoyed Wine Connection
5
Foods were excellent... their seafood pizza is highly recommended... the wines are affordable... we super loved the take away promo... we horded bottles for take away
5
Excellent service by the Asst Manager and his team. A big shout out to Simon, who went an extra mile. Me & my friend, who is visiting from Switzerland enjoyed our dinner there
5
We enjoyed the food and service. First we were greeted by a lovely young lady "Tina" who has a vibrant personality and set the tone for a friendly welcoming dinner.We had salmon and roast vegetable salad and well priced wine and beer. It was a pleasure to enjoy a quality meal and good company.
5
We have eaten here a couple of times - Robertson Walk and more recently at 112 Katong. Service was brilliant! Tina was an absolute sweetheart, nothing was too much trouble and she was quick to help me out with the menu and alterations due to a food allergy. Lovely personality and very efficient. Best waitress we've met in a long time! Singapore can be very pricey, but we were so happy to discover this gem. Food was delicious and reasonably priced, and in a country where wine is expensive, we enjoyed a glass of NZ Sauvignon Blanc for $9. Much better than the $18+ at other restaurants. Ambiance was great, very trendy. Quite like a Melbourne eatery. Definitely be back next time we're in Singapore! Thanks for having us!
5
Food is great and the tenderloin steak is really well done. Staffs are friendly and helpful especially Simon. We had a great time here!
5
We are Very fond of the food and wine @ wine connection. We have been visiting the store at least 1-2 per week. Love the service, a especial thank to Simon who has been very attentive to us
4
The food was delicious! Give my compliments to the Staff Especially to Monica "Supervisor, we appreciate your attention to detail when you answered our questions. You're more helpful than you realize.You light up the room.Thank you for the extra mile that you put into this effort. It was one of the best place we have visited
4
I ordered a rare steak and received a very tasty rare steak - this is not a small thing. in my experience not many restaurants can actually deliver a rare steak to the table.Service great, interesting wine by the glass selection.Very popular restaurant in the evening.Nearby restaurants are cheaper but in this case you really do get what you pay for.I will be bac
4
I was at your store on the 15/10 at 7:15pm.I was greeted by a very friendly staff named suren.He served me with extremely good service. And i notice that he was also serving other tables with his fantastic service. Will definitely be back to the store for this service i received today. Cheer
5
The choice of wine is unbeleavible and very good value , and the food is also first class , service excilent staff excilent , well worth a visit,
4
I like my pizza with a very thin base & this place does for me the perfect pizza. I had vegetarian & four cheese, two visits. Handy location in I12 Katong.
5
We were Frens gathering for dinner n drinks. Simon took really good care of us and recommended food to pair with our wines! This evening was splendid!
5
nice ambience overall experience dining in here was excellent.
good service provided by ms dior and her staffs.
4
Nice cosy place, good food and reasonably priced. Courteous staff and agreed to our requests for spicy food.
5
Dine at wine connection at I12 Katong, was impressed with the wine selections and the service was impeccable too. Had a great night. Thank you guys!!
5
Great selection of food always well prepared and service is good. Weekends are very busy in the evening so expect a queue Friday and Sat nights.The highlight for this place is value for money, not only the food but the selection of quality wine and there prices are very reasonable. Give it a go
5
I have stayed at the Roxy hotel many times and never come across the Wine Collection Bistro and did so by chance. Now I have I can't stay away! Really great food, wine and service and very reasonably priced. It's a really laid back atmosphere and the wine is by far the best I've had in the area and the most sensibly priced and you can buy in the adjoining shop too. I would definitely recommend if you want somewhere local and like the usual pasta, pizza or tapas style food.
4
We dined at Wine Connection @I12 twice. First went there with family for a dinner and today went there with hubby just to try out their set lunch.Both times, the food were yummy and the service staff were very attentive to our requests. For today, 2 different staff members came to check on our table: how's the food? especially for my steak, is the doneness ok? etc. 2 thumbs up for the service.Today I ordered wine by the glass while for our first dinner, we had a bottle to share among 4 adults. I find the wine to be very affordable, and they are good wines! Definitely will go back.For the set lunch it is also value for money :
4
Comfy and cosy setting that could accommodate my table of 6. First time having dinner at Wine connection and the food really surprised me! Waiting time for the food to be served was short, good for hungry bellies! Items ordered: 1) Surf and Turf sharing platter ($45) you can choose 3 items, we chose chicken, tenderloin and prawns.2) Carbonara3) Truffle Linguine Pasta4) Pesto Pasta5) Tomato based Pasta6) Carnivore Pizza7) Tiramisu8) Apple crumble ($14)9) Lava cakeWould probably not recommend the surf and turf, not value for money at all although the tenderloin was nicely cooked, portion for this was small. Pastas were well cooked and tasty, esp carbonara and truffle linguine (cream based) however, the pastas lacked ingredients which you could get bored eating it by yourself. Hence recommend to share with friends! Pizza was lovely! Thinly crusted and flavourful! However the desserts were a little disappointing...esp the tiramisu! the cream absolutely took up half of the cup, no strong tiramisu taste at all. will not order this again as it is not value for money. The apple crumble (comes with a scoop of vanilla ice cream) was the best in my opinion. We decided to go for the waitress's recommendations on the wine and ended up opting for 1 from Spain, the Rioja. It was smooth and easy to drink. Staff was well knowledgeable and provided a good recommendation! We had a great time and will visit again
5
Nice place to dine in with Family and Friends. Food is superb and service is great. Food serving time is fast and staffs are very friendly and attentive. We will surely come back 👏👍👌
5
Great wine selections and on point recommendations from the friendly staff. Special mention to Dior, who was very helpful throughout!
5
Great food and drinks for great value. So good we gotta come back again! Try the gambas, lamb chop and many more! First class experience!
5
A great place with amazing ambience and service. Special mention goes to Dior she has been extremely friendly and helpful. Will definitely be back for more

5
Had a very good evening - good food and wine! Ambience was great with both indoor and outdoor dining.
4
Having frequented this particular establishment on many occasions I feel compelled to bestow upon them appropriate praise!
Boasting a choice bill of fare as well as a consequential wine list makes for a most enjoyable lunch!
5
I just finished dinner at the Wine Connection in Katong 112. It's a busy night and the restaurant is full. It's the perfect circumstances for bad service. I am pleasantly surprised to say the service was excellent. The food was delicious and arrived to the table quickly. I'd like to especially acknowledge Igor. His professionalism and friendly service will guarantee a return visit.
5
Pleased to find the restaurant open ... as usual Spanish Gambas + Gove Mill SavBlanc is a winner.If you have not tried ... put it on the list ... always great. Service from Suren makes it an easy choice Happy customer 1 - Gambas 
5
Today marked the first visit to wine connection in this branch and we were overwhelmed by the service provided. Special thanks to Ms Dior whom made us feel like home. Her hospitality was heart warming from the start when we queued. She upkeep her excellent service till we we seated and recommended her best selling wines. The wines were impressive and most impt at affordable prices. During our session, Ms Dior constantly showed her customer service skills by checking on us if all was well. Wine connection is definitely proud to have Ms Dior as an outstanding staff! Cheer
4
My wife and I decided to visit Wine Connection after we chance upon the restaurant 3 weeks ago. The restaurant was almost 70% filled despite on a Monday evening. The experience was indeed pleasant and food/wine were good.We would highly recommend if you are looking for a quality decent meal and value for money.We were greeted and served by enthusiastic staff and Sarah is definitely one of them
4
They have a really great, nice and friendly wine sommelier here. She gave 2 great recommendations that made our night perfect. It you are ever in the area, no if you are thinking of getting drinks, come here la... :)
1
I am so disappointed with this outlet of wine connection. The service is super lousy and I really dislike the manager there. It's so different from other outlet. Won't step into the place again.
5
This is my 1st stop after my flight back from Taipei, had a quick dinner there. For dinner I had Medium Rare sirloin steak with blue cheese which compliment it extremely well. Their service staff is over the top, big shoutout to them! Keep up the great work
5
My friend and I had the best time! The assistant manager Dior was everything we could ask for in a host. The wine recommendations were exactly what we were looking for and the service was top of its class. Will definitely return for many more nights of wine debauchery. Be sure to ask for Dior and you'll be well taken care of
4
Stopped of for an evening snack here and selected the gambas and the foire gras starters as my meal accompanied by a couple of glasses of Riesling.Nice music, comfortable seating and wifi. Option of nice air conditioning indoors or ambient on the street side veranda. Pleasant dining experience - reasonably priced
4
I was traveling with a pick eater so we ate there 3 times. Pasta was good but small basically a thin crust we had it for an appetizer. Pasta was good, steaks were good, and I had Bangers and mash which was also very good. Did not care for the Fish and chips not sure if the fish was old but not the best Iâ€™ve had
5
Nice n peaceful. Music is low... great! No screaming voices above loud music. Just sound of chattering in excitement of the days happenings n updates...Nice service staff who remember my last visit n remembering us by our name. Wow utterly impress!Food n drinks are good
4
Usually busy, this outlet has a good selection of wines and variety of options for food. The staff are very friendly and willing to take in your requests. Special shout out to Sarah who always takes care of our food needs! You can use your membership here for the wines only.
1
I have been here a couple of times and I must say that the standard of the food has dropped each time. Once, my sisters and I were served burnt pasta! This was a huge health hazard for my sister who was pregnant at that time. When we made an issue about the burnt pasta and demanded we will not pay, the manager handled it very poorly and basically told us they will not charge us out of "goodwill" but not because he thought serving burnt food to a pregnant lady was terrible. They should have compensated without hesitation in whatever small way they could to seem the least bit apologetic. I would suggest going to the Wine Connection at Robertson Quay, the food is way better there and much better service is expected
3
Lots of choice in Katong.The range of wines is the main attraction here. We had the crab soup and the salmon ravioli.Soup was OK. With the ravioli, I felt like the bear in the stream hunting for the salmon. Ravioli had lots of potato filling but where was the salmon?Good service from the staff and the place was certainly buzzing
5
Excellent service by Sarah! Glad we were here to celebrate our friend's birthday & they have made it an exceptionally great one.
5
Good ambience, service and food. We loved the cheese platter, the spaghetti and the thin crust pizza served quite promptly. Definitely worth a second visit!
5
Had dinner with family as advance celebration of Father;s day.
I was surprised of how good their dishes are. Staffs are very attentive despite heavy crowd. Though I do not drink alcoholic drink we'll definitely back to try more foods.
4
Great variety of wine to choose from. Food were tasty & uses quality ingredients. Staffs were friendly, helpful, & attentive. Nice place to chill with your friends & loves ones.
5
Had a very pleasant lunch here with my wife and son. Everything was of high quality and good value, just as it was when we last visited Singapore almost a year ago. We hope to dine here again on our next trip !
5
Last Sunday our family decided to celebrate Mothers' Day at Wine Connection Bistro - 112 Katong - It is our first-time visit, my family was impressed, the food was cooked very well, tender & juicy, good wine with great service. Would definitely recommend dining again.
5
Me and my Friend had a great time there :) Amazing pasta and wide range of wines. Our waitress and sommelier Tina was a great help, and recommended really nice wines based on our preference and was very friendly :)Would recommend the place to all wine lovers 
3
Came here because of the good ratings of other chains and the restaurant was packed during dinner time. Service could be better because when we first walked into the restaurant the reception looked at us and walked away into the restaurant instead of telling us how long we should wait. Food was served pretty fast but we ordered medium rare grilled salmon and it came out raw except the outer later. Pizza was soggy and lack of spices. Somehow the appetizers prawns and mussels came later than the two main course, luckily they tasted better. Overall it was okay, just not great.
5
I have been a regular at this outlet of wine connection (at 112) for the past 17/18 months or so and I have to say that they have a solid range of wines (both red and white). The price range is wide as well, so you may choose whatever suits your budget. Some of the super wines that I have tried are Tinazzi/Amarone (Italian), Brands Laira (Australia), Angus the Bull (Australia), Pradio ... Pinot Grigio (Italian) and there are actually many many more to choose from. The food is fantastic and is pretty reasonably priced. Give a shot to the salmon fillet, pork skewers, tenderloin steak, and the pizzas. The staff is very friendly, attentive and extremely hospitable. Travin (Manager of the outlet) and his people are doing a wonderful job and they always make me want to come for more. I have brought several friends of mine here, and each one of them has had a positive experience ... all my friends simply love the wines that the outlet has to offer and they feel very comfortable dining here. It's a great place for meeting up and in my opinion every single dollar is well spent. The place, Travin and his staff get 3 straight A plus' from me. Keep up the good work guys!
5
Simon was able to recommend a wine to our budget and to our liking.And when my friend didn't feel well after the drinks, took the initiative to provide her a cup of hot water with lemon in it. Really sweet. Superb service indeed, thanks so much, you have left a lasting impression
5
Decided to pamper ourselves before Monday starts and decided to visit wine connection. Was impressed, good food, good wine with great service. Would definitely recommend their pizzas. Will be back to try more of their menus.
5
Good food with good people !!!
Nice set-up going too!
Will sure want to be back for more.
Really enjoyed the desserts & pizzas too !!
5
I've lived in Singapore for 8 years and Wine Connection has always been a place to go for reliable pasta, steak and of course wine. The wine selection is of course huge and you can buy wine at the shop for takeaway as well. Wine is expensive in Singapore however at Wine Connection it always seems to be considerably cheaper than pretty much everywhere else. Good reliable and well priced food and I would always go back
5
Visited the bistro over the weekend. Service was good despite the crowd. The staff, together with their manager worked very well and spared no effort in ensuring that every guest was treated equally and to the best of their abilities. They might have been stretched thin but they pulled it off. Kudos to the team and their excellent training by the managers. We'll definitely be back.
2
Thia is my 3rd visitIts a nice sunny day and hot weather so decided to have some wine and food... food is very normal. Wine is good and cheap. Service is need to improve....is not like my previous visit....the wait staff and the manager should be more visible.
4
We went there for dinner on saturday night around 8:30. It was busy but we waited less than 5 minutes. We had 2 pizzas, mozarella tomatoes and one glass of prosecco each for $75 which is rather ok. Food was good and so was the service. But it was very noisy, we will definitely come again but earlier/later to avoid the crowd
1
This place has the worse service ever. We went as a group and one of my group member came in a bike and park his bike outside the restaurant. The manager demanded us to leave the Restuarant if we don't move the bike away. He even called the police to come, I can't believe such lousy service from the same joint I always go to. This outlet brought shamed to the whole company
5
Been to Wine Connection Katong frequently. I would say that they provide the best service among the the other restaurants around that area and also lovely food . One of their staff (Abey) is very friendly and cheerish. Greeting and saying 'Thank You/Goodbye' in my very own language (gracias , ve a ganar) really gave me a home likely feeling . Keep it up!

Went there for lunch, dejected we were for not getting movie tickets!Out sadness turned out to be a major happiness in discovering this marvelous Bristro.Great place to eat and relax!!Out standing food items to select from and enjoy. Our 5.11 year old granddaughter almost polished off a pizza!!! The thinnest of thin crust it was.Their all round service was outstanding and indeed very remarkable.Good ambiance as can be seen from the attached photos

Great location with outdoor seating. Very nice staff. Love the Memminger beer!
Food is pretty delicious too. A good Cheese with a good red wine, nothing else to wish for. ;-)

First time here and will be my last time as well. Terrible service provided by the managers. Aircon was leaking water and splashed onto us. Dessert was not good. Food was ok. Maybe we didnt order wine, so we were not treated well.
5
Probably my favorite place in Singapore. Good meat, great wine at very reasonable price. I go here almost every weekend and brought many friends you came back later.

Hello. Please give our thanks to the Supervisor " Monica" and others for the wonderful Service and bottle of sparkling wine for my Birthday. We had an amazing time. The ambience was so comfortable, the food absolutely spectacular. Our waitress was just wonderful. Looking forward to dine with you in the future. What a great place

Had a hectic week at work. Need to chill so came to my recent usual weekend hideout. Ordered a brownie as desert after dinner n wine today. Quite upset that the ice cream on the brownie was not a full scoop. Spoke to the service staff, Simon. He immediately offered a new scoop of ice-cream after apologising upon seeing the pathetic scoop. Very impressed with his empathy and immediate action. Thanks Simon!Bests, Elain

I have gone to wine connection Katong very frequently . It's hard to find good service restaurant in Singapore but not at wine connection Katong .They have a good ambience and most of their service staff are good and attentive and I think the manager did a good job for training them. They are attentive and friendly and also pleasant. The food there are good so bring your family and friends down.

We unexpectedly ended up at Wine Connection I12 Katong on a Friday evening. Despite our large group of 10 plus a baby, the staff was willing to help us secure a table. Service was great, food came promptly, dishes were delicious, staff was generous with their recommendations and they were spot on.We will definitely head back again for another meal with our friends
3
Been there a number of times. Food is ok. Wide selection of wine at unbeatable prices. Only downside is if you have a grouping of more than 4, it is very difficult to get a table even if the place is not particularly full. Was there yesterday hopefully for dinner and requested for a table for 6. There were a number of empty 4 seater tables including 2 at the front that could easily have been combined to accommodate my group which in my previous visit, was done. In fact, the counter staff even suggested it but for some reason, the manager did not do anything. We were kept waiting for about 10-15 minutes with no queue and a number of empty tables. Spoke to the manager and he requested us to wait. After a while and with no sign that anything was done to accommodate us, we then left
3
My wife and I shared the paella (SGD39.00) and found it tasty and adequate. The portion was generous with just the right amount of seafood and chicken. My kid had the spaghetti bolognese which was cooked to perfection too. The service was friendly and helpful. If you want a fuss-free and relaxed lunch or dinner this place is a good choice
4
I have dined at all wine connection outlet and found the one @ Bistro Katong to be my favourite. I have noticed many a time, the manager (Travin) goes the extra mile to ensure that his guests are given quality service. He knows how to take care of his regular guests and make them feel good each time they visit the Bistro. I strongly recommend for an appraisal for his outstanding service and good work where I see regulars going back time after time just like me. Once again, kudos to the good food, great wine and sterling service from the manager

Went there for lunch on a weekday. One of my Favourite joint for a lazy afternoon. Price is decent, tried their two course set lunch - Friend had steak, I had pasta. Pays what you get, no complains.
3
decent, ok foodnothing to complain for the pricewine and beers are on the cheap quality is not badstaff are friendly and casual they reflect the characteristic laid back charm of katongwe like to eat here before movies in I12dads can have a few drks before movies with the famil

I passed by earlier and asked for their closing time, was told by a female waiter it was 1:00 am for weekend nights like today, came back at 11:50 pm and was refused service by two of the most rude male staff I encountered for a long while now... "you must leave now because we are closed", they said... not a hint of customer service whatsoever... if you can avoid this place you will be better of... sad as this is not common in Singapore
3
Wine reasonably priced and a range of food options to suit a family too. Good basic quality but nothing outstanding and quite inflexible about offering salad instead of the wedges with the main. We were there as a group of friends but found it quite hard to hear one another over the noise
2
Just had dinner with my wife and kids there. My dinning adventure was kind of dampened and disappointing. Asked the staff taking my order to recommend the sauce for my lamp dish and a glass of house wine. The answer to both questions were please select from the menu. I was exploring the place and hoping that the service would be inviting so that I can consider entertaining my clients in large group here instead of the usual Chinese and Seafood restaurants. However, the experience left me wondering. The food was alright though
5
My wife and I fancied a light lunch. We both had a tuna salad, which was extremely tasty and contained some really delicious ingredients. They had a very good selection of wines from several continents.Their wine counter to the rear of the restaurant sold wine by the bottle which compared very favourably with the prices charged in the local supermarkets.Very good value for money 
1
I ordered 2011 TerraMater at $45 as per menu. Server served 2012 instead. When I enquired, no good reasons given, no lower charges offered. It is dissapointing coming from wine expert as wine connection core business, telling that they still charged me $45 because they came is from same batch? Wines are more pricier the older they are - just in case you didn't know, just in case you wonder what the fuss about. You need to have a good well trained manager or staff to explain to customers who appreciate wines. If you made a mistake, apologize. Don't come up with crap excuses. It's NOT the $45 that I fuss about, it's the way your staff disrespect wines and its value is what I am perturbed. I used to be a wine connection fan. But now, I think wine connection service is becoming below standard. Get it improved please
4
There are mixed reviews for this place but what do people expect with a shopping centre bistro? Any ignoring the negative we found the choice of food good supported by responsive service and nice wine - all the essence of a good bistro.Our food arrived promptly - my pasta was delicious as was my wife's salmon fillet.The place is brightly lit and seating quite upright - it's not a place you would want to lounge in for hours on end slurping wine but this is not its intent.....We would recommend the place but see it for what it is
2
Have a birthday dinner there for eight pxs...cold platter comes n with slices of bread. ..no butter...made a request and was told it is charged at $2 for it....what!!! Comes the birthday cake and because we are having the cake in the premises. .there will be corkage charges per person for Cake. ..another surprise charge...food was over rated. .fish was served raw cooked...replaced after big exchanges of comments with manager in charge...had 4 bottles of wine and wait staffs services does not comes with smile. ..wonder why they are in this services if they are not happy just because customers who spent more than $500 gives feedback. ..it certainly spoil our night.,,our first n will be our last time in this place..dinners watch out....byo....butter n jam n do not chose this place for birthday celebration cos they are only interested in quick customer who eat n go....not the place to be...there are plenty of choices given the price
3
Good food, good wine and given Singapore, reasonable prices. But, just because there is a disclaimer in the menu stating that it is policy to serve food at your table when it is ready, this is no excuse. Four main meals were delivered at different times (10 - 15 minutes between each one). A competent chef and kitchen should be able to prepare meals so that all come to the table at the same time
3
Visited this place for a business lunch earlier today. Nice setup and ambience. Loved the Pinot Grigio. Food was average. Service needs improvement. Overall, nice experience.
1
Wine is good. Food is disgusting. They served us reheated the chicken - dry n smelly
Would never come here again
4
We ate in the outside area where the ambiance was pleasant and the service efficient. I had a very palatable steak served with excellent chips. The wine was great too. A good way to complete chores and begin the weekend wind down.
5
We were a little hesitant after reading some negative review but we had a wonderful dinner here this evening. We just moved to Singapore a week ago and decided to try this on our realtor's recommendation. The waiters were friendly and efficient. We shared a foie gras appetizer and it was delicious and very reasonably priced. Hubby had the beef tenderloin steak which came with a variety of sauces to choose from and I had the spaghetti carbonara. For dessert we had the lava cake and creme brulee...all equally good. We did not get a bottle of wine but did a glass each instead and all wines were very reasonably priced. We opted to sit outside as it was a nice evening and less noisy outside. I can highly recommend this restaurant
4
Spent a casual evening dinner at this place, food was good, wine was modestly priced and decor was modern.We tried to get outside seat but we were told that its all booked, although there were empty tables, food was not served together, few ppl have to wait long for their food and air conditioning in the dinning area was not uniform
3
When the indoor restaurant is packed, the room is way too noisy and the tables are just too near each other. You can practically hear your neighbours conversation clearly. Not a good place to chat during dinner.The food is just mediocre as they specialise in wine as they branding tells.I can say they have very good cheese & cold platter to go with the wines.Overall experience, didn't motivate me to return the 2nd time
3
Visited this restaurant for the first time last week. Food was great and wine was super and all reasonably priced. But OMG what about training the staff to work in a restaurant? My dish (lamb shank) was served within 15 minutes. My wife ordered the ribs and after 30 minutes we were still waiting for them. When I asked after her dish I was told the policy was to bring out the food when it was cooked! I questioned the fact that people wanted to eat together (as we went as a couple) but all I got was a shrug of the shoulders. We finally called the manageress who understood the issue and both arranged the ribs to be served and also warmed up my lamb shank (which was stone cold at this point). I wasn't looking for any discount but billing me for customer service I thought was a bit strong. The food and wine saved the day and I will go back. But if service does not improve it will not be a place I would choose to frequent.
1
We came in to enjoy a glass of wine but our server miss communicated the price of wine to us . When the bill came in we raised this but both the manager and the server gave us no respite . We offered that the restaurant should charge for our consumption only the manager insisted a miscommunication is not their fault . She did waive off the service charge from the wine but overall poor service recovery . Have been to other wine connections before and had much better service
5
Great ambience, excellent service. Didnt get to try any wine but the food was delicious. Tried Parma Ham Fettuccine with Truffle Oil & also had two different cuts of steaks and pork ribs. Pasta was cooked al dente. Steaks were really tender and were cooked to the perfect doneness. The flavours of tenderloin burst inside mouth with the first bite. The Pork Ribs were a little disappointing for me as it was not flavorful enough. However it was moist and tender, meat falls off from bone. Price is rather affordable. Service staff, Givenchy, was friendly and cheerful. All in all it's a great place for dining

Yes, I am Italian and I love european food, with all respect for local cusines. As I travel a lot for business I always search for a place where I can eat something nice, simple , frsh, and better if Italian or french. I found all this at Wine Bistro Connection in Singapore. This place has a very nice set up, the menu offers a wide choice among most known interantional plates among which are many italian specialties: Ravioli, Spaghetti, Carpaccio, and much more. I had a Greek sald to start, and as well I ordered a plate of carpaccio. After less then 5 minutes my food was delivered at my tabe from a very nice and friendly girl, Jocelyn , who also gave me some advices on Singapore. As I was still a bit hungry, having been all day without eating anything , so I ordered grilled seared salmon wth salad. The fish was very well cooked, soft, tender, juicy , very tasty. It also took just a few minuts to get it delivered on my table. I had also two glasses of White wine. Italian Pinot grigio and a bottle of water. The accept orders till 10.00 pm , as I was kinldy informed from Enoch, another waiter that attended me with great courtesy and very professionally. What to say? Not only the food is nice : the staff is very nice, they always serve you with a smile on their face and they are very friendly. I want to thank Enoch and Jocelyn for their good manners and their spontanous way of doing, very welcoming and polite.. All and all a total positive experience with a final bill of less then 65 SGP dollars. Worth to go and I will go back again

Great concept , awesome interiors
Felt relax.
Welcome and wishes as you steps in to bistro,
Great offering of wine and set meals, prices are wallet friendly.
Service was good, but still space for improvement.
5
Dinner with my friends at i12 katong outlets and it was 1st visit so lucky that we got ms irene there to assist us for wine recommendation. We like her excellent service!!
5
Great food and excellent service by Mr. Simon Teo! Will recommend my friend to visit the restaurant!
5
The service and food were top class. Very friendly staff who gave excellent service and the pork ribs just fell off the bone. My wife had the "Bangers and Mash", which she throughly enjoyed. An excellent lunch.
5
Good service by Simon Teo.
He has recommended my friends and I for at good wine, good Chardonnay wine.

Was expecting to dine and wine in a cool, neat place but it turned out otherwise. The place is loud, you can't have a decent conversation without having to shout across the small table to your partner. I felt I was having dinner in a hawker centre. One of the patrons even sat with his right foot crossed under his left thigh, revealing his sole to other customers. How unappetizing!!! The Schnitzel that I ordered was tough but no complaints against the Fish and Chips. Service was okay though a little hectic. Overall, this Bistro needs to improve on its room acoustics to dampen the loudness.
5
We had a good dining experience in Wine connection serve by irene few days back. The food portion is good for sharing n she make us feel at home. We can also see that she engage with other customers as well. Always coming to our table and ask how's the food and everything. She has a good knowledge about the food and the wine. We love her service n we will bring more people back the next time. Thank you for serving us. :
1
Such a shame! Lovely location and great affordable wine, however I ordered the tenderloin and what I was served was a fatty lump of meat. This is the second time as well. The newly appointed Assistant Manager (Irene Gan) was rude, unknowledgable and lacked customer service skills. Our evening was ruined, my partner received his meal. When I showed the Assistant Manager my lump of meat she simply removed it and stormed off. My advice is go across the road to Astons or Rabbit Carrott Gun. Advice to Wine Connection train your managers to have some customer skills

My husband and I are regulars in WC. We either go together and share a bottle of bubbles and a cheese board or we take our teenage boys for dinner. The food and wines are great and for very affordable prices.The atmosphere is very nice and the staff is welcoming.I also go to WC with my friends on a 'girl's night out'. We all live at the East Coast and this is an excellent place to catch up and share a meal and drinks together. Keep it up, WC! I will recommend the restaurant to friends
5
Wine connection is my boss favorite place to dine, at least twice a week. this is the second time he brought the whole family (all the staffs) along. Good service from Simon and the crew. Excellent food and affordable wine. keep it up!Asia Access Teleco
5
the staff are very friendly and accommodating.
i really love the carbonara!
the price is very affordable.
5
Food was great. Nice selection of wine at reasonable price.
Service was prompt.
Will return for another visit soon soon! Keep it up guys!

Food was awesome. The maestro wine recommended by Jocelyn paired well.
Great food! Maybe you could extend opening hours on weekend :)
3
Definitely a good decision to go for a drink @ I12 after work. Ambience is a little noisy but just the way i like it. Enjoyed myself and may come back for another round next time.
4
We love our neighborhood Wine Connection! Food is good. Wine is cheap and the staff is Fantastic! Kudos to Givenchy, super service!
5
We are regular customers with Wine Connection. First time we tried the "Set Lunch" option and we were pleased and enjoyed the meal.What makes Wine Connection at Katong I12 shopping center is the customer service, specially Jocelyn; the Assistant manager, and team excellent..,! Keep up the good work and attitude.Esteban Galarrag

Went there with a group of friends (there is 4 of us) on 11 April 2015 in the late evening. Ordered Meat Lovers Platter to share and we love the platter! Meat is tender and juicy! Rather good serving for the 4 of us to share as we weren't very hungry. Ordered a total of 8 glasses of Moscato. We were served by Mr Xavier. He is super friendly and full of patience!!! Awesome service!

Went beginning of March to the newer one of the Wine connection branches at Katong. We usually go to the Robertson one. It is definitely not up to par with what I have gotten in any of the other places. Singapore or Thailand for that matter. I was always raving about the quality but now I can only say service and food was horrible.Even after complaining twice about the rib eye's. They still had the nerve to charge us. My steak was fine by the way. It was twice the steak of my wife. First time cooked well done instead of rare. Second time it looked like it had been chewed once before. Ugliest cut ever with more fat than meat. Because it kinda ruined the experience we declined the dessert they offered and we were aghast they charged us still for the steak when we asked the bill.When confronting them with the situation the cashier looked at me like a it was weird for me to suggest that in normal circumstances that one steak would have never been charged.We were not only disappointed with the quality of the food, but the non existent service recovery. We had high expectations because we've always had a good experience at the outlet at Robertson Quay but it's safe to say we will probably never return to the outlet at Katong. Jocelyn was the staff handling the issue, or should I rather say NOT handling it. Just in case the management wonders
5
I am glad that I choose the right place to dine in. The manager travin served me with full enthusiasm, his confidence in his recommendations on the bistro food and wine was just what i needed to cheer me up when I am having the Monday blues!!
4
Been to the other outlets before many times. I tried a lot of main dishes here and all turn out GOOD!! This time I visited the outlet in katong, their set lunch promotion at $18 was not only reasonably cheap, surprisingly the portions were generous and fulfilling.. They have quite a wide selection of wines. My all time favorite is their sparkling desert wine. It was a good start to the day to have such great food accompanied by great service
5
Love the cava semi seco here.
Always feel welcomed.
Kudos to Jocelyn and her team for providing a great time everytime I come down for drinks w my friend
5
The paella was extremely filling and superbly delicious with the combination of seafood and chorizo•• Irene was an very efficient in attending all my needs making my overall visit a very satisfied one
4
Shared tomato mozza and beef caparcio with my friends. The food were above our expectation. Will definitely go back again. As a wine lover, the all time fav ladies desert wine, pink moscato was really good as well. Lastly, Xavier, the service crew was really attentive to us too! Good service
5
after a long haul flight, all I personally wanted was a glass of wine or two to end the night. my mates and I chanced upon this gem, and I've gotta say their selection of wine itself is beyond us! some kind waiters assisted us on a great bottle of red alongside with some great pizzas and superb paella (oh it was heaven); at mental prices. ended our night better than we'd expected. would definitely come by again when we're back in town
5
Dined in with my family.. We Couldnt make up our minds on deciding which food item to choose as we were spoilt by too many choices. The friendly server recommended us the popular dishes. So We started off with the gambas and grilled veg salad. This was followed by the meat platter which was excellently made. Finally topped off with sole apple crumble which was very sumptuous. The only downside to the whole experience was the long waiting time during the peak hours due to management not taking any reservations for that period. Overall I would definitely recommend going to this place to my all of my friends and colleagues.
5
I'm a regular customer at Wine Connection Bistro at 112 Katong! I always love the service! So prompt, so attentive! Food is amazing as well! Best place for cava and some cold cuts/ pasta/pizza! Love the team headed by Jocelyn and her team, like Enoch and Faz.
3
Been in this restaurant many times, very good food and vines on reasonable price. Only problem I have had with food when I ordered a salad and some of the leaves were spoiled. Asked the waiter to show and tell it for the chef but don't now if that ever happen, at least I didn't get any response. Service is sometime atruggling, there is one Indian guy, think he's manager or something, who should not not work in customer service role
5
There was a dinner crowd by the time I arrived but nevertheless I was welcomed by the staff. The prices was relatively cheaper than the other restaurants in the mall. Food was excellent. A young Chinese lady attended to all my needs. Overall I had a fantastic dinner before my movie. Thumbs up to the service crew!!!
5
The lunch set was value for money. Had a 2 course meal and the portions were decent. Even though the waitress was pregnant, she was very attentive to my needs. The manager gave me a good wine recommendation to go with my Sirloin Steak. I would definitely come back again.

3,5 starsI like the Wine Connection formula and regularly go to their Robertson Quay branch. Love the buzz, cheap wines, good value bistro food & tapas etc. Great surprise when I noticed the construction of their new Katong branch several months ago and couldnt wait to make it my new local favourite. We've been 5 or 6 times now and it still hasn't warmed to us. More or less the same menu as in RQ (minus the tapas), cheap wine but unfortunately the food quality and service are not as expected. Main courses come before starters, main courses are brought with 10-15min intervals (i know it's common in Asia-SG but not aligned to their format) and the execution of the dishes is not on par either. Brotzeit across the road does it better across the board and recently made their menu more similar to Wine Connection (cheap wines, cheese and cold cut boards etc).However, I live nearby, love Mediterranean food so will definitely continue to go back and hope they make it as good as their other branches.Please add your tapas to the menu! :

Simply awesome,
Great Atmosphere, service, food selection & prices. Value for $$ paired with foods & dessert. Definitely recommend families & frds. 👍👍👍 keep it up guys !!!
5
Simply awesome! Atmosphere,service,food selection & prices.Great value for $ paired with food & desserts. Definately will recommend families & frds. 👍👍👍keep it up guys!
5
We had lunch at a very affordable $18 for a steak! This is a great deal including appetizer or dessert. Atmosphere and service was great.
I can only recommend Wine Connection in I12Katong, a casual affordable and service orientated restaurant. Keep it up!
5
I went to the katong branch tonight to dine with my family. The service there is excellent and make us feel very comfortable and welcome us with a warmly smile. However, I felt that the food served have some room of improvement to be done but nevertheless, this is definately a place that is worth coming back again...

This bistro has some strong points that almost anyone would like. It's got a great location. The atmosphere is great with both indoor and outdoor (covered) seating. You can buy the wines on their menu as well as others at their attached bottle shop. The decor is nice and comfy. Their pizzas are great. What they need to improve upon is their service. S some others have indicated, the attention to the customer is lacking with some servers requiring either multiple attempts to flag someone down or having to get up and go to a server and ask them for. . . Well, service. With some servers, there is a sparky attitude that is quite frankly horrid. If service isn't what the individual loves to do, then that person shouldn't be a server...go collect a paycheck elsewhere. The customers deserve better.Will I return? Of course I will. It's 80m from where I live - can't beat that! Would I be there more often if the service was better...again, of course
5
The food were defintely value for money,decent and suprisely delicious...good ambience. .personally prefer katong outlet especially during weekends as we were able to enjoy our meal away from the weekend crowd..the staff were always professional and prompt in their services.Wide range of wine choices available too! I have always enjoyed the meal with a bottle of wine with hubby during every visit!Thumbs up! Defintely a rare gem hidden in katong
5
After being many times at the new Katong 112 Wine Connection i really can recommend as very good option for food and wine. Food in general is good and they serve the best apple crumble in town specially if Jocelyn,the assistant manager is on duty. Like her friendliness and professionalism
5
Heard about Wine Connection but never had the chance to dine in. Great to know that there's an outlet in the east, near to home. Decided to have reunion dinner with my family during CNY. The outlet was very busy but food came out promptly and seasoned well. Service was good, manager came around to check on tables. Great experience! Would love to come back again soon
5
I am impress with the smiles and friendly despite the tight labour position. Simon and Jeremy was very prompt and efficient to take my orders, recommend and suggest. The manager Trevor was also quick to intro himself when checking on tables and making sure all is in place. Thanks guys! For making my evening a rock solid one!
3
I have pleasant experiences with the counter staff whilst purchasing my wine every time so I applaud them for their sunny disposition! But on other occasions that I have wine and dine; I find the service staff needs room for improvement. They are not aware of their surroundings and/or have no initiative when it comes to service. There are times when the venue had only a handful of tables occupied but you hardly can get their attention! Though they are physically there; their minds are somewhere else or pre-occupied so it takes many many arm waves to get them to notice you! I sometimes just give up and walk up to them instead.Lastly the service staff needs to smile!Hopefully, the next time I am there. I will see some improvement in the service staff
4
Good option in the east for wine at reasonable prices. Service staff and manager were also very friendly and accommodating to our food requests. Definitely a place that I will recommend and be visiting sometime again soon!
4
Here for countdown 2015 and although the place was super busy, waiters were helpful and friendly. There's a waiter called simon who was super helpful in the recommendations of beverages and very friendly as well. Would come back here for more drinks in the future!
5
Fantastic experience each time I come. Food is value-for-money. The staff are very knowledgeable and friendly. Special mention to Simon Teo and Enoch Abraham for excellent wine suggestions each and every time!
5
I was hot after deciding to take the MRT and walk back to my Hotel but pleased that I came across this place, I sat outside and had a very nice Italian Pinot grigio with a couple of Tapas plates, attentive service, relaxed atmosphere, excellent list of wines by the bottle
4
I been to it outlet at Cuppage Terrace a month ago; I preferred this outlet at Katong mall;with lesser crowd on weekday when i came with a friend; We ordered a bottle of French Cider, a pasta, a prawn starter and a pizza; it a HAPPY late lunch for us after work:) The service is great, efficient & the ambience is much better with more seats indoor than the one at Cuppage.I'll definitly go to Katong Wine Connection again
1
Due to some crazy company policy you cannot book a table at 8pm. It has to be 7pm or earlier so save yourself the wait and go elsewhere
4
Great service and great food at very affordable prices for Singapore. It is unsurprisingly becoming quite a full venue as people start to realise that they offer good western food at significantly lower prices than some of its local rivals. We ordered the beef platter which included ribeye, tenderloin and sirloin; all were very tasty and cooked to perfection. Wash this down with a Rioja or their Chianti and you'll be pushed to find a better meat eating experience on the East Coast
2
Need to hire and train properly their staff. Big difference with the Robertson quay outlet which is great
5
We had a great experience last night. While looking through the wine list our waiter Simon came to assist us. Telling something about a few wines and his knowledge was spot on. We enjoyed a lovely Chardonnay and our food was beautifully presented. Simon kept our glasses topped up without being in our faces. Can't wait for our next visit and hope Simon will be on duty
3
Yes, they have a big variety of and good wines and they are value for money. The European food and dishes are also coming at a good price. The waiter who served me was very friendly though not a professional. The young lady who told me there is no place left reacted a bit strange when I showed her a free table, smile did never come to her face. The ribeye steak's qualityy I ordered was not great, it was OK. The seats and tables inside and outside are very narrowly placed to each other, if you like to overhear others talking this is the place. What I really like is the adjacent shop where you can buy the wine from them and bring it back home
