Terrible food and pricey. Just poor value for money and left with a bitter taste. Staff were indifferent to feedback

I ordered scallop porridge with fish in the clay pot while shopping at Bishan junction eight. It is delicious and the portion is quite big for one person. I will be going back to try their claypot rice and frog leg porridge with my friends.

My family went to the Tampines One branch. Service staff was prompt in attending to us. But they should be trained to tell us the items being delivered instead of us guessing what is in the pot since we ordered different types of porridge. Food considered delicious as they are served hot.After payment, the service staff did not thank us for our patronage which is pretty disappointing.We do hope their customer services will be improved as we intend to visit them again shortly

My friends and I visited the branch at Tampines One Mall on Level 5. There was no queue at lunch time. Service staff were swift & prompt. They were polite, kept helping to top up water in our flower tea that sat in a transparent teapot (over a small candle).I specifically loved their dishes with salted eggs or salted egg yolks- scallops, spinach etc. Their Toufu dishes (claypot) was good. Very delicious 'home-cooked' dishes and they came out piping hot! My friend said they served nice fish noodle soup which I will try next time. We enjoyed our lunch there very much. It will be our usual lunch venue now.Keep up the good efforts team

Tried this branch at Jurong Point after the longest time. Restaurant was full but they managed to get us a table within minutes. Service was above average as the staff actually recommended us dishes in a friendly manner despite the peak hour crowd.We tried the different porridges and while I find it a little too bland for my liking, the rest of my family loves it.Price is acceptable and for the quality of food serve, it is actually value-for-money

We're first time visitors to SG and have been here less than a week. We've had a fair introduction to hawker food, and for me, this was a step up, although the prices certainly reflected that. I had a chicken claypot dish, and it darned near blew my head off, such were the chillies. I can't wait for tomorrow! I don't know if that's how people enjoy food here, or if they just do that to foreigners for their amusement. But, it was tasty, and I liked the presentation. My wife had the scallop and fish porridge which she enjoyed, although the serving was too big. We also had jasmine tea, which was very nice, and which possibly saved my throat from 3rd degree chilli burns. There was a decent service, more efficient than friendly, but clearly one which made an effort to accommodate the hapless tourist. The place, as is normal here, was spotless, and we ate with confidence

This is a review of A-One Claypot's outlet at Seletar Mall.A-One Claypot House is apparently famous for its porridge which is quite expensive, all above $10, apparently because of prized ingredients. However, it has quite an extensive menu of other food cooked in not only 2 different claypot styles but also, on hotplate, in soup, deep-fried, steamed as well as stir-fried. Also on the menu are noodle dishes.Though prices are on the high side (Stir-fried Lotus with assorted vegetables $12.90++, Claypot Luffa with Prawns and Brocolli $16.90++) for instance, my family liked the wholesomeness of the food and found the portion adequate. They particularly enjoyed the hotplate venison. A-One Claypot's herbal infusion of dried fruits hot drink which is caffeine free, containing no added sugar and served in a nice transparent pot is also a must try at $6.30 per pot. This outlet located at the second floor of Seletar Mall, unlike other outlets, is quite big and even has round tables to cater to bigger family out for a special meal. There is currently a 30% discount on all dishes on the menu for those dining from 10.30am to 5pm. Service is quick and attentive too

This review is for the branch in Nex mall. Was there during the peak lunch period and there was only one other table with one guy eating. 2 service staff present. Had the seafood hor fun and stir fried french beans. Hor fun was Hor-rible. Squid was tough as old boots, and it had no wok hei....you can definitely get better from the tze char hawker for half the price! The reason we decided to try the branch here was because we were amazed at the tasty food we had at their Seletar mall branch. The jiang nan noodle had plenty of fresh tender topping and had the all important smokey flavor. The claypot rice came with the must-have burnt layer at the bottom. So if you are craving for some claypot rice or noodles, please do not go to Nex, or you'll be sorely disappointed

we happened to be in Chinatown Point and was scouting round for a place to have dinner. Decided to try A One Claypot House.Nice white environment and waitress was quick to serve.Found the vegetable dish slightly oily. Claypot rice was nice and fragrant. Be prepared to pay restaurant prices

Always here with my family for lunch. Gung Pao clay pot frog leg with porridge is the one I always go for when here. My son love the vegetable soup and beef. Overall the service is excellent. Can request not to be serve with the steam peanut if not wanted.The rest of the porridge is also worth a try. Definitely recommend to give this place a try.
