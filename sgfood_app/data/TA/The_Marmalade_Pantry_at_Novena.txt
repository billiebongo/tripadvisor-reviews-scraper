We had the valentines day menu on 14 feb and the food was decent..however, cleanliness was a big issue. Plates had fingerprints on them and one even had an ant crawling on it. Sad as we thought this place hadhgreat potential.
5
Went there with my Son to use the entertainer app vouchers. Food is nice. Service is fantastic! Portions are a little small though.
4
Had dinner at this beautiful restaurant. Love the whole set up and feel. Food was good but price was slightly steep. Would come again!
5
Marmalade Pantry always doesn't disappoint with the food quality it serves. Service is also good and guests are happy. Only thing was that simple things like mushroom soup and a salad were not available, unfortunately.
5
The servers and managers were friendly and even come to our table and ask if everything was good. I enjoyed the ambience as well
4
Yay thanks to entertaiber thats why im there. Food abit pricey but the ambience was good.
Service abit slow but nevertheless an enjoyable experience.
4
Service staff were great. Food was okay ~, though pricey. Portions were pretty generous! Ordered the beef burger at medium rare, but got it more towards medium/medium-well.
4
Waiter did not warn that salad entree size was not counted for Entertainer App promotion. Salad section was included, but did not specified that we must order mains size to use promotion. I donâ€™t think the restaurant would have made a loss if they honoured the promotion. But because they did not, it left a bad taste. Otherwise food quality and ambience goo
4
Went on a weekday for the afternoon tea. Ambience was nice and comfy. Service staff were great too. The afternoon tea at S$38++ for 2 pax, was however not exactly worth it. It came in a 3 tier set up with just simple finger sandwiches, mini scones, 2 cupcakes and 2 pots of tea. Taste wise, just average.
5
We rarely write feedback on our food trip, but this worth the time to have one. We had a buffet breakfast, and as we entered the resto, it was cosy and vibrant. The food was fab and a lot of variety to choose from and child friendly. And plus points to staff asking for your choice of coffee
5
Great services and lovely place to meet up and catch up with friends. The place is not too crowded or rowdy. Thus we could slowly enjoy our meals and the company.
4
Service was prompt and attentive. The waiters checked on us and our liking for the food. The lobster burger is s must try
5
Service staff will come by our table occasionally to offer to top up the hot water in our tea pots.
Scones and sandwiches are the best I have tasted. Sandwiches are made of very fresh ingredients with very balanced flavors.
5
Staff was very attentive and kind. Food variety was not much, but the quality of all the dishes presented was very good. The ambience was very calm and relax! Will go back there again soon!
3
Liked that the restaurant was quiet on Christmas day, but the food was quite disappointing. I have been there before and remembered the food being good, that's why I went back! Service was average as well.
4
good atmosphere and excellent service! The service staff were all very friendly and they were all quite attentive.
5
Good food & great service from staff Fairuz! Take note of this guy! He makes the dining experience really amazing! Nice chat, treat & flower from our new friend!The truffle beef burger and the baramundi is really good. So is the pork belly and mushroom risotto
4
Came in a weekday night a the place was only about 70% full. While other areas are jammed pack with diners, Marmalade Pantry offers an oasis of serenity.I ordered the new truffle burger ($25) and was impressed by the very strong truffle flavour in the burger. Followed this up with one of the best red date puddings ($14) I've ever had in my life!Well worth a visit for yummy food away from the hustle of the dinner crowd elsewhere, albeit at a small price.

went here twice in a week for Christmas gathering with my friends on two separate occasions. Food quality and taste was great - infact , i would give a 4.5 star out of 5. However, they fall short in service quality expectation. 1st visit was on a Friday night, three females sharing two mains, one salad, one fries. Background music was too loud for chitchat, service staff kept wanting to clear our plates although the place was like 60% occupied. Upon their 3rd request to ask for plate clearing, my friend told them to stop coming and give us some time. We ordered two cupcakes for sharing, but both were hard and cold. Totally fall short of my expectation. I would say skip the cupcakes,.2nd visit on Christmas Day. 5 females - sharing 4 mains, one FULL salad, and one fries. This time, no background music due to feedback from other patrons. A waitress as usual, came by to ask for plate clearance and asked how was the food. We said the food was great, but salad portion is abit too small. Waitress commented: " portion too small? do u mean too small for like 5 pax sharing one?". Great. We skipped dessert and coffee here. Snobbish customer svc.
4
Was invited to dinner with friends. Quite a nice place for a small gathering. I ordered the gourmet burger. It came with fries and salad. $25++It was tasty and the portion was large. I didnâ€™t have any extra appetizers and was very full. The fries were crisp, the beef burger juicy with melty cheese. On the whole it was a nice meal made with fresh ingredients. The service was ok, but could be more attentive to refill water and check on our dining experience. Not bad for a western style meal. The location is abit off for me, so I doubt I will make my way back to this branch soon but maybe other outlets.
4
I ordered salad with beets and truffle risotto. I found the salad was on the sour side and risotto was a tad bit salty. Otherwise the experience was amazing and bill was affordable for such ambiance.
5
We enjoyed the food, especially the truffle mushroom risotto and seafood pasta, and the place is perfect for people who prefer quiet venue with gatherings. Service is also good with friendly waitresses.
5
Nice Christmas festive ambience at the Oasia Novena, really loved the style of the restaurant. Staff were friendly and helpful, food was delicious. Would definitely return again.
5
Delicious food and impeccable service makes a great dining experience. Had the truffle beef burger and lobster risotto which we enjoyed thoroughly
4
There were asian & western menu so one can choose according to what kind of food you feel like eating. The sticky toffee pudding was very nice.
5
Marmalade pantry has never failed me yet. Great food, great service and great atmosphere. Love the pasta. Used to like the salmon when they used tohave it, could eat 4 times a week. So sad they decided to stop it
4
The food was as usual great as I have tried most of their outlets and the food still stays consistent and nice
4
I love the place, the beautiful furnishings, quiet environment and accessible location. I ordered a set of pancakes, but to my atonishment, I realised the pancakes were pre-cooked and freezed. All the Chef did was to remove it from the freezer and put the pancakes inside the microwave and serve it on a plate minutes later. I definitely dont want to pay $18 for a pancake that isn’t freshly prepared so I cancelled my order. The manager Joseph did an excellent service recovery which I appreciate. I hope they’ll work on this in future.
4
our first time visit to the marmalade pantry at novena as we've always visited the branch at ion orchard instead.. the service provided by the staff was excellent.. the ribeye steak was pretty good too.. not to forget the sticky date pudding to go along for dessert after the main course - awesome.
5
If you're really famished, then get their beef burger on the plate. If you're not too peckish, get their halibut. If you're everything else in between, just order everything else from their menu.With a rating this good, anything that comes out of that kitchen is seriously mouth-watering
4
Great food with quiet environment for gatherings. Quick service and polite staff. Would visit again.
5
Enjoyed the service and the food was yummy! celebrated my mum's birthday and the waiter and waitress are v friendly!
3
Visited on a saturday. The all day breakfast, toast was burnt, benedict was over cooked. However, the truffled mushroom risotto is good.
5
Looking forward to the next visit.Always a joy to dine here. Used the amex dining promotion and received good discounts
3
2nd time here. Food quality was good but not standout. Pity there was only 1 dessert option for the dinner set. Service was poor and inattentive
4
The dinner set is value for money and the Lobster Thermidor is the best I've ever had. Desserts were very good and pretty too. Definitely will come back again!
3
A little overpriced.
Truffle fries were only alright. Fresh truffle on it but the actual truffle taste was too light.
2
Restaurant is under-staffed on a Saturday, service is slow. We asked for warm-water for our table and we had to ask at least 3 times before our glasses were filled. Our drinks took at least 15-20mins to be served. And, they are supposed to be serving pretty good cakes but their cupcakes are just so-so only. It is a total disappointment.
3
The ambience was lovely and it was nice and quiet as four of us were the only ones there . The high tea however was not very balanced in terms of its sweet and savoury offerings. There were only 4 very small sandwiches in comparison with one large cupcake and 4 scones. The scones were too dense and the cream had a texture more akin to butter
4
I was late for the reservation and my girlfriend was waiting for me outside the restaurant. The staff approached my girlfriend and ask if she made a reservation cause she can take a seat and wait inside the restaurant instead. After we finished our dinner, the staff approach us for feedback and took our comments rather seriouslywhich can be hard to find now. The food was pretty good but can get a little noisy
4
Very good environment for high tea as it wasn't crowded but the restaurant is slightly under staff. But scones and tea selection is good for the price.
4
This branch is much better than in Ion with Asian food menu and better service. Only thing is a bit confusing if you come out from Novena mrt station.
4
Great food. Good service. Nice place. Definitely a place to go for comfort food. Will be back for more.
4
Been here countless of time. They recently changed menu, and portion seems to be lesser, but quality of food and service remains. I do miss their Pan-Seared Salmon!
4
Been here before and tried more dishes this time around. The Halibut and Kurobuta pork are fantastic. Will try then again next time.
3
We have tried their Dinner Set menu, everything seemed ok to me at Oasis Hotel. Is a nice place to chill out with friend....
4
The place has pretty nice ambience for gatherings and the food is good too. I had the spicy crabmeat pasta which was REALLY spicy. I also ordered a slice of chocolate fudge cake and it was huge. Definitely value for money!
4
The food we ordered taste awesome and service rendered beyond expectations especially with a baby on the feast with much disruption!
Wanted to say “thank you” to service crew Fairuz for his attentiveness :)
4
Had Lobster Barley Risotto, Spicy Crab Linguine, Quinoa Salad, Mac n Cheese and Truffle Fries. The food was all really well done with great portions (also very generous with the seafood) and also well plated. We used the Entertainer app but if we hadn’t then might have felt it to be a bit overpriced for the food and the location. Nevertheless, it’s still solid, good food!

We're staying in the hotel and have eaten in this restaurant twice - which has been quite enough to ensure that had we been staying longer we would have taken our custom elsewhere.Dinner - the food was excellent but the service was sloppy. There were only two of us and our ordered drinks didn't come together but with a five minute gap and a reminder inbetween. Similarly, a second round of drinks came were served in the same way, and the second drink had to be requested again. Desserts - only one was served, we had to remind the staff that we had ordered two and as they were both exactly the same this was an issue that shouldn't have happened. It seemed to us that the staff were concentrating rather too hard on getting the place ready for breakfast the next morning, and not on ensuring that the dinner customers were attended to properly. Unsmiling, curt and uncaring would sum up most of the staff.Breakfast - we tried breakfast a few days later and were thoroughly disgusted. Not a word I use often but the staff attitude was appalling. Breakfast is billed as being served till 1030 so why, at 0950, are whole rows of tables unavailable to be sat at because they have been laid for lunch? People were having to find staff (who were busy preparing for lunch service) to ask for refills of cereals and cutlery etc on the buffet, a waitress was busy removing all the labels from the juice bar so that no one knew which juice was what, and dirty tables were left unattended. But woe betide you if you sat at a clean one that had been laid for lunch - as if by magic a member of staff would appear and shoo you away.I went to the hot buffet and had to stop the same waitress from once again removing labels from the food. I spoke to another member of staff about this practise but to no avail, within a minute of my sitting down with a plate of food, the waitress was back and took every single label off the arrays of food. It wasn't yet 1000 and the buffet had another thirty minutes to run. I counted at last fifteen people arriving after this time, all of whom had puzzled looks as they surveyed the remnants of what was left and tried to identify it.Is it really so difficult to try and remember that customers come first? If there is not enough time between the two food services then adjust the times. But to charge top class prices and receive service worse than that at a fast food chain is a disgrace. We won't be back
3
Food was average. But service makes up for it. Their seafood spaghetti was not too bad. But price was expensive for a club sandwich.
5
Went there with a friend. Food was consistently good and delicious. Service was attentive. Will go back again.
5
I had a wonderful experience at Marmalade Pantry. The food was excellent. The steak was well done and the red velvet cake was great.
5
Great fried rice and sambal fried rice.order of food took awhile but portion was very substantial. :)
3
not like what it used to be. but still loved the mushroom risotto. mac and cheese was not the best. 1 for 1 drinks at 13 for 2 wines always welcomed
5
Great dinning experience. Nice friendly staff with good food and great ambience. Perfect personal service and well attended to. Would definitely visit again ver soon. Reasonable price
4
nice restaurant with decent ambience. truffle fries was amazing! the rest of the main courses were nice too
5
Took the opportunity with a 1 for 1 promo they have. Was there early at abt 6pm and we were the first few diners at that hour. Very pleased with their food. We ordered the prawn & scallop pasta and the egg & steak. It was marvelous. We'll definitely be back
4
My wife and I recently dined here on a Saturday afternoon. Erm though it was 12.45pm on a Saturday, the restaurant was hardly crowded and we had no problems getting a table for 2.Having dined at the Oasia Downtown and ION outlets previously, we found the Novena outlet a lot cosier and a generally better experience (could be due to the fact that this outlet was less crowded than the other two).We ordered 2 mains - a minute steak sandwich and a crabmeat pasta; both of which were well executed, tasty and of a sizeable portion. Prices are slightly above average but for the food quality, ambience and good service, this was justifiable.This was another very good Marmalade Pantry experience and we wouldn't hesitate to return to the Novena outlet in the futur
5
This restaurant is located on the first floor of the building housing the oassia hotel and novena specialist centre. It has an informal and friendly bar/waiting area before you enter the main restaurant area which has a very modern and stylish look/vibe. It can be fairly crowded at times which is testament to the quality of the food, Singaporeans being mindful of where to find good food (many doctors from the surrounding medical hub and shoppers from the 2 nearby malls) as well as travelers living in the hotel, make up regular clientele. My personal favorites include the local Hokkien mee, the salmon with linguine, the pasta with scallops and the pear pudding dessert which is to die for ( fluffy/crispy pastry pear pudding with fruit/ice cream, crunchy bits and caramel sauce. Perfect juxtaposition of hot/cold, sweet and savory and multiple textures in each bite. Heaven!!) And the service staff led by Warren and his friendly team are warm, personable and attentive without being intrusive. Great place for a quiet conversation, group get together or family meal. All also can. Highly recommended
4
They make it their business that your dining experience is well looked after. We don't get that in many establishments nowsaday. Really appreciate the team putting in such great effort! Keep up the good work!
5
Very spacious, food is delicious! Nice ambience, this branch Asian menu such as Tolkien mee surprised us. Surpass our expectations of hokkien new from a cafe.
5
Risottos were spot on, al dente. The stock used had a richness to it, appreciated it. Service was phenominal, prompt and alert. Friendly to all of the customers!
4
Service was quick, probably due to visit being on a weekday. Not much crowd at the Novena outlet. Nice food with 1-1 house wines.
5
Mr Warren and his hardworking staff are always attentive to my presence and orders. Excellent services and super yummy cup cakes...
5
A little pricey though but quality of food is high! Really like the beef cheek pasta. Tender and flavorful!
5
I've been here more than 3 times already and Im still impressed by their service and food. The service team is always willing to help in whatever way they can and the food, is always flavourful! Certainly a great place to dine at!
5
Went to this restaurant to celebrate the birthday of my Father and son. We were greeted warmly by Joyce and guided us to our reserved table. Food was fantastic and service was superb. We were all delighted by how attentive and thoughtful joyce was. She surprised the bday celebrators with cake-(for my father) and cupcake (for my son). Such a happy and fun night. We all enjoyed. Thank you for the wonderful experience
5
Visited with a gal friend and our babies on a weekday afternoon. It was nice and quiet for us to enjoy the afternoon. Staff was very nice to seat us away from their main customers as we had babies (who might scream and cry). We had the Afternoon Tea set which was delicious and very filling. Thumbs up to the Gryphon tea selection especially the Moscato Blanc which smelled and tasted SOOO good.The set came with 2 cup cakes which we couldnt finish and the staff kindly packed it to go for us. We will return for the service and food again. Thank you
5
My friends and I ordered the chilli crab pasta and were blown away by the flavour and texture of the dish. It was delicious, to say the least, and was loaded with tons of crab meat. I will certainly be back just for this pasta again
3
Service is very slow. It must be improved. Ambiance is very good. Food is okay. Can be reconsider...
4
With the amex 1 for 1 mains, this is probably one of the best choices for an informal business lunch. Foods good for sharing, prices reasonable.
4
Very nice ambience located strategically in the Novena area. The burgers were good although food took 30min to arrive. Do try their cakes as well
4
Food is excellent as always! Environment is quiet and good for getting together with friends. However, service needs improvement!
5
Service is good, ambient is ok, order a 2 course set dinner menu, it's delicious. The recommended dessert is very good.
4
I had the dinner set here with 2 of my friends and it was the day before PH. The food was really nice but portion was small. The service was really slow as we had to ask for drinks and deserts about three times.
5
We are a family of 7 and we dined at The Marmalade Pantry at Novena. Because our reservation was made at 6pm, upon arrival the restaurant was empty as dinner has just started. Slowly, the restaurant filled up and it got busy. 5 of us arrived first and we made our orders for the set dinner. Fairuz was super attentive to our table and kept us updated of the lamb shank being almost sold out. Throughout dinner he paid alot of attention to us which made it special. Whats more! I had a pleasant surprise when they surprised me with a cake as it was my birthday! Thank you guys for making dinner awesome!
2
We had dinner at the Marmalade Pantry in Novena and will not be going back again. The great food and nice ambience was completely overshadowed by the terrible service. Our mains took around 1.5 hours to arrive, despite the restaurant being only half full. We did not have a big table (6 people) and yet the food arrived much later than the orders for other tables, both with more and less people than hours. Some of these guests at other tables arrived after we had placed our orders.What made the experience worse was that the wait staff appeared clueless and indifferent, despite numerous requests to check on our food. Their standard response was "it is coming", but they did not seem to make any genuine attempts to check on our food, as they did not return with any updates. It was not until after the fourth time that we asked that the food finally appeared, almost 1 hour and 40 minutes after we had ordered.Although all our food tasted excellent and the presentation was nice, it had become functional by that time as we were so hungry. I wouldn't recommend this place unless you are okay to wait for a long time for your food and be served by aloof and unresponsive staff
1
Our first visit. Reservation was made for the afternoon. Place was not packed. We were brought to a table which we are not comfortable in. Requested for a change of table. Was rejected bluntly. Overall we felt that the crew are inflexible, unfriendly experience
4
We decided on this restaurant at the last minute. There were four of us and all of us ordered the slow cooked spring chicken. We used the Entertainer coupon so it was great value. All of us enjoyed the meal tremendously (though it was tiring on the wrists cutting though the chicken; we did not want to leave a piece). The gravy was superb! I hope the kitchen maintains the standard and give enough gravy for the chicken. The wait staff was also exceptional and we were treated like VIPs
5
Had the salmon with yuzu and spring chicken both of which were well done. Ambience was great as well good for gatherings and couples.
5
Had a wonderful time chatting with my friend, while enjoying a good meal.
The service staff were friendly and quick with their recommendations for food and beverages. Found the menu a little on the pricey side, but all in all, a great experience!
4
Other than the outlet at Ion Orchard, the one here is less crowded and makes it an ideal place to enjoy a good read over coffee, tea or refreshing smoothie. Besides the usual menu, this outlet offers local mains like laksa and hokkien mee!
3
Food wise was good but there were too many flies in the restaurant which were very irritating.
Service wise was good as well.
5
Quiet and pleasant dining place with service excellent staff who embrace customer service which is rarely found in Singapore nowadays.
2
Food was decent but service was erratic considering the place was not busy. Service staff was amateur. I felt like I was getting MacDonald service. Actually Macs was better. Fast, efficient and way cheaper.
5
Walked in the restaurant and was welcomed with a smile. Seated and immediately served with some water to settle down. Ambience was good, environment was quiet and food was really to my liking. I ordered a filet migon and the waitress recommended a wine to go with. Perfect place for gathering/ date.
1
Ate here a few weeks ago. Food was good, but was so traumatized by the treatment from the head waiter. He didn't have any inch of customer respect. They did tell me to come back for a free meal to make up for the bad service, but after going through something like that, I will never ever set foot in this place. Such a shame for a beautiful brand.
5
Invited for lunch with an industry buddy (friends forever now!) for a new-year catch-up meal. Not wanting to indulge in heavy a meal, I opted for the pan-seared salmon that was topped on chilled sweet potato noodles with sesame, cucumber and yuzu dressing. We beckoned Yati (name on her badge) over to take the order. I told her I was her difficult customer for the day and explicitly said I wanted this dish to be zero-sodium.(Yes, I am trying to cut down sodium levels - for health and personal discipline reasons).I would also leave it to the creativity of the chefs to put the entire dish together in whatever ways they desire without compromising the overall taste.Just no sodium.And it came back - in reasonable time - as tasty as it should be and I must say the thoughts of returning to MP is just too tempting now. Let it be known I washed the salmon all down with cold-pressed orange juice.A simple meal but one that left me feeling light and somewhat victorious! So yes, a shout-out to Yati for her sweet service and the chefs in the kitchen who moved in tandem to feed me in a most simple and delightful way
4
The tea set that comes with 2 cupcakes of your choice, 2 pots of tea of your choice, 3 types of sandwiches (2 each) and about 10 scones (2 types) was good for all 5 of us.It also wasn't too crowded on a Sunday afternoon
4
well the mains are normal (with exception for the pan seared salmon which was pretty good) but i have to say the desserts were awesome. definitely a place to stop by for its desserts.
5
My second visit... Shared the sandwich and laksa with the business associates. As usual the staff was very accommodating . She split the laksa into 2 bowls so that we could share. I love the taste of both items .
5
So impressed with the high quality food and atmosphere at the marmalade pantry. More importantly the service was exceptional. I have to especially thank Kiran for making us feel SOOO welcome as soon as we entered-best service ever!!!!!! Will definitely recommend this place for anyone looking for excellent food and fabulous service in Singapore
4
The restaurant was located at the first floor of the hotel, looking like the usual hotel's coffee house. The dine in area was quite wide, much bigger compared to its ION outlet.LOBSTER BARLEY RISOTTO ($32.00)butternut, carrots, onion, garlic flower, lobster chunks, lobster braised barley, parmesan, sour cream and tarragonInstead of the usual rice for risotto, barley was used here, which soaked up the flavours nicely and gave a kind of bounchy texture.MISO LOBSTER ($34)lobster chunks in tobiko and miso mayo with cucumber and red radish on sesame bun with shoestring friesI was slightly disppointed that it served on burger bun that had not been toasted or fried with butter. The lobster was chunky and well marinated.GOLD MOSCATO ($7.50++)White tea with gold dustIt was light and refreshing.PURIFY ($9.50++)kiwi, orange, papaya, mangoDetoxifying, cleanses the internal system and aids digestionThe freshly squeezed juice was thick and rich.I was using AMEX platinum which was suppose to have 50% discount when dining for 2 paxs, but turned out only 50% off for the 2 main couses. Felt slightly cheated by the promotion
4
A nice and quiet restaurant to visit in the Novena vicinity. This outlet is located in the Oasia Hotel which is opened from breakfast to dinner. Dinner is a good time to visit, with less patrons , the place is quiet and service staff are attentive and warm. We had the minute steak sandwich and roasted spring chicken . The chicken was tasty and tender , however the steak was a tad chewy today with medium doneness. The warmth and friendliness of the staff made us feel very welcomed, and the quality of the dishes are quite consistent. Will return again for a relaxing dinner 
4
We went there for dinner on a weekend using our Kitchenlanguage vouchers. The menu was not exhaustive but sufficient for the 3 of us. Service was unhurried, not for those rushing for time. Wait staff were all very friendly and attentive when we needed them. We had lobster barley risotto, an interesting dish in itself. Steak was very good, done the way hubby wanted. Pork chop was good, paired with a lovely sauce. Desserts ( ice cream and cake ) were so-so and not worth the trouble.All the main courses were slightly too salty for our liking. If they tweak the salt a bit, it would have been perfect.Price was a wee above the midrange. It was a hotel restaurant so it was functional but cosy for dinner. Parking was at the neighbouring building with per entry charges.Marmalade does not have a comprehensive menu so you pretty much cover all the dishes after a couple of visits
4
We visited twice, their laksa and pasta were delicious. We had beef burger and a fish dish on our 2nd visit. Burger patty was ordered medium raw which was too raw at the middle section but thankfully my boyfriend was alright. My fish dish was tasty and I especially like the idea of prosciutto that wrapped around the fish and the foam made. Waiting time is long though
5
I love marmalade pantry's spicy crabmeat pasta and sticky date pudding. But the other branches have always been very crowded. So when this branch at Oasia Hotel opened, I felt I chanced upon a hidden find because it has an amazing ambience and it's rarely too full! It's now my go-to place for comfort food. I've been there alone, as a small family with an infant, and with friends and every time we go, the service staff is always so attentive to us.
4
Visited this place for lunch as my colleague had the Entertainer app.Both of us ordered the steak and eggs (works out to $26ea (inclusive of taxes)! What a great deal!Surprisingly, the steak (medium doneness) was juicy and tender! So full of flavour! The sunny side up was also beautiful with runny yolks
5
Thankful we happen to be here at the right time as there was Amex platinum card promotion.We had a bowl of laksa and a club sandwich, we had asked for them to split the portion or give us sharing plates/bowls.when they served, they had split the laksa into 2 bowls. It was tasty tho it was abit too pricey. The club sandwich with sweet potatoes fries were very tasty. The staff who served us were very attentive and very friendly. A little set back is that they took quite a while when we were settling the bill
5
Great food and ambience..
The bloody Mary was one of the best I had in Singapore... So was the French toast and sticky date pudding.
A fun place and a must go.
3
This restaurant has possibly the most romantic setting in all of Singapore.
Set in the midst of greenery and amazing horses.. The ambience is to die for
4
Had the smoked salmon hash (quite small portion) and spicy crabmeat linguine which was lovely although the spicy crabmeat linguine wasn't that spicy at all. Location is good, located at the hotel which is a short walking distance from Novena MRT. The place is also quite spacious but can be crowded on weekends lunch hour. It looks like it's the breakfast place for those staying at the hotel as well. The service staff were good, but the waiting time for the food needs improvement. I waited almost 30mins for my food to arrive when i was there around 1230pm but i would visit this cosy private place again versus the Ion outlet
3
I have been to The Marmalade at the stables, which closed down in 2015. Was impressed by the food then as well as the Cakes from Ion branch. Today was my 1st time at Novena and we loved the deco here. Staff was attentive & helpful despite near closing time. Steak was good though bit too fatty & slightly chewy for medium rare, carbonara was good too. Use your Amex card to get one-person free

Recently I booked some 10 days in advance a seating for 10 persons, then 15 persons for a large family gathering which included several overseas guests. I picked Marmalade @ The Stables specifically because of its outdoor seating area. At my request (and reconfirmed again when I called them a few days later), the booking was confirmed as outdoor sitting. 24 hours before my reservation, I received a phone-call from them to say that the outdoor area was not available and "would I mind changing to indoor?" "Yes, I would mind", and their response was "well okay then, so can we confirm you for indoor then." You can see how the conversation went downhill from there...I called again a few hours later, this time talking with someone with at least a better customer perspective who said "Sorry about this but..." and explained that they had a large group of 50 people already booked outside. He also mentioned the first caller was "new, and didn't speak good English." I decided to cancel my booking, and was offered a "free desert next time you visit." I suggested that the manager give me a call rather than asking a new junior hire with limited English to make calls to customers amending their reservations.So far I am still awaiting to hear back from the manager (I think he/she may have tried once, but no voicemail message so who knows) ..... but I definitely WON'T be heading down to Marmalade anytime soon for my free desert. There are much better options in the vicinity of Marmalade and would suggest trying out the always reliable "Picotin" which is what we did in the end
4
It's always amazing to find places in Singapore that feel 'away' from it all. Just getting to Marmalade Pantry is a fun adventure. As a lover of the great outdoors and from rural Australia, I love the drive down the little road into Fairways, past the old racetrack, through the stables to pop out at this idilic settling. Simple and solid food meets with a great Bloody Mary and friendly staff to make it a lovely spot to go with the family for lunch or your better half in the evening

The potential of this restaurant is very high however the management and the food needs to change ! We had to wait for more than 1 hours to get our food the waiter was not able to tell us what was in out juices and he kept on bringing us the wrong order! On top of that our waiter was absolutely rude!Once we finally got our food it was super disappointing, so this is sad to say but it does not worth the trip!

First time at this location, which is rather nice. Out of the center of the city, totally worth the drive sourrounded by nature and horses (not in the wild). Same menu as city location at ION and my all time favorite by far is the crab salad, very generous crab portion. However, the service was extremely slow and unattentive. Came just at it opens at 10.00 for breakfast, waited and waited to be seated until we finally had to go to the bar to ask to be seated. Waiting for app. 20-30 min to place our order. Absolutely no flexibility in menu change (although items were on the menu). Constantly had to ask for more water and more coffee. The restaurant was not full and waiters would hang out by the bar or just not see us. Worth the food and location, but please work with service staff to provide better service

The Bukit Timah Saddle Club is definitely worth a visit, for the lovely lush surrounds and to see the horses stroll between the stables and riding course. To then be able to sit amongst the tranquillity and grab a nice bite and coffee is a bonus. Marmalade Pantry is a fantastic spot, and much less crowded than its neighbour, Riders Cafe. While Marmalade doesn't overlook the riding course, it is set on a little hill where horses are sometimes brought to graze, shaded by lovely trees. It has become our weekend breakfast "getaway" of choice. The staff are very attentive, it's stroller friendly, and the cupcake station that greets you upon entry is a huge temptation!The breakfast fare is the usual items, but done very well. The french toast is to die for! Caramelised pears, vanilla ice cream etc etc...The only place I'll indulge my sweet tooth for breakfast! The fresh juices on offer are varied and delicious. Highly recommended spot for a quick bite, that makes you feel like you've left the city behind....

when the first interaction with the staff (after waiting 5 mins at the entrance for someone to talk to us) is: "we're fully booked!" without the customary "hello" and " sorry", this does not bode well.As we indeed had booked, (we've been there before) we got to place our order 20 mins later; considering, the restaurant wasn't packed at the time, that was the second service fault.Out of 4 drinks, one juice never arrived although requested 3 times, same for the extra serving of chips.Finally, our much expected platter of small desserts did not make it ever to our table.All this sloppiness did not seem to warrant any particular remediation from the manager, so we made up our mind to not return to the Marmalade Pantry and try the other place in this lovely nature spot
