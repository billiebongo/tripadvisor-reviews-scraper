It is good family restaurant. They serve local dishes and Chinese food. We love the soya satay and tom yum soup. The price wise its not heavy for your pocket. If you like veg food must try this.

Every time we go to Singapore, we try to make as many trips we can to this restaurant. Such a relief to have 12 pages or so menu with finger licking menu options. We always take the 'small' dish version of each dish, so we can select as many as possible

Accompanied by Singaporean friends (who were able to specifically order good dishes with waiters who had limited English capability) we enjoyed an excellent dinner at Eight Treasures. The menu offerings are wide-ranging and our food choices were very tasty and imaginative with the result that it is not always obvious that the food is all vegetarian. The upstairs location is relatively quiet and airconditioned, which allowed us to enjoy a pleasant meal experience on a hot day. Recommended for both vegetarians and non-vegetarians who enjoy wholesome, tasty food at reasonable prices

Words fail me how good the food was. True to form we over-ordered to try more dishes with intent of taking the unfinished food back to our hotel. Sadly it was not to be - there was nothing left of it. Our stomachs were screaming for mercy while our taste buds were screaming for more. I am not really familiar with Singapore prices, but I felt the bill was a bit high at SGD60 for 2. The waiting staff were a bit weak on English, but made up with plenty of smiles. The friendly and efficient host stepped in as soon as any little thing needed attending to or clarifying or whatever. Efficiency and speed of service could not be faulted.However any niggles I expressed are just that, the food is to die for. If you are in Singapore and a vegie (and maybe even not) JUST DO IT..
