Even though we were 1hr late from our reservation timing, the staff did not give up our table, instead hold it for us till we came. Upon reaching, the restuarant was 100% filled but their service and turnaround time was not compromised.

Select from 200+ dishes on the menu, pick whatever you fancy from the Classic or Premium selection. Food prepared on the spot, fresh & yummy. Small cozy restaurant with attentive service, good value.

Two price tier between the Classic and Premium, for those with who only like basic Japanese the classic is good enough. Good for group gathering. You may order what you want and no need to get out of your seats.

Read a review on Chope and decided to make a reservation to enjoy a nice Japanese meal out of town. Price was reasonable but the offering differs greatly from the written description of the place. The dining area was too dark for an enjoyable meal. Air was stuffy. My bowl was chipped. Not the standard you expect of a good Japanese Restaurant

Had dinner with group of friends and we went for the premium buffet. The seafood and sashimi was fresh. For the price we paid, it was definitely worth a visit. Remember to place a reservation before going over as the place is quite small and can be pretty crowded during peak hours.

Ala carte buffet, food was okay, not much variety for weekend brunch buffet, went on New Year's Day. Think my dad would have preferred their premium buffet instead. Probably go back for their premium buffet next time. They also gave me a complimentary slice of green tea with red bean cheesecake as it was my dad's birthday. Lady who took our orders was very patient.

Kushi offers an amazing spread of Japanese favourites with wide variety of choices and high quality food. The serving staff gave great recommendations and are invariably friendly. In particular, the restaurant Boss, Larry is a great chap who proactively assist customers with their needs. Prices are very reasonable. My wife and l had an amazing experiences. Kushi has definitely become one of our favourite Japanese restaurant after this wonderful gastronomic experience. Thanks Kushi

Sashimi very fresh, spider temaki nice and crispy, just these alone worth the visit. Salmon head excellent. However, stay away from the tempura and shishamo, very oily. Ribeye was pretty gamey and also not recommended. Maki really good variety and good balance of flavours. Overall great service and good food but stay away from the oily fried selections.
