Second visit & enjoyed the Barachirashi lunch set again! Loved the fish slices done in aburi style (slight grill on the top, raw sashimi at the bottom). Tried the Uni Trio ($48) this time and enjoyed it too.
5
Brought my hubby here after a few visits with my colleagues and happy to comment food was value for money, ambience was relaxing and not overwhelming, service crew was attentive

It was a casual walkout neighborhood when I found IKYU; hidden omakaze in the heart of Tiong Bahru. Adjacently opposite niche forty hands cafe, hidden deco with start of art for their ID. I’m surprised by the welcome with smart casual feeling ahead.We tried out the Sunday special set dinner with curiosity and it exceeded my expectation from the first course until the last course that I don’t clearly remember the names but the flavors are just awesome with a local tweak. Recommend to those whom are neighboring to this restaurant
4
Food is of a high quality and really well done. The restaurant itself is not to big giving cosy feel
4
Love the modern industrial decor! Service is good, same goes for food quality. But price can be better.
3
Nice restaurant with exceptional service, however Omakase experience was disappointing. It wasn't able to bring us through the flow of the Omakase experience, sashimi has a smell/taste of plastic, I guess it is the way the fish was stored.
5
IKYU is a very modern place. Lighting can be abit dim because of the glare coming in from the front glass wall. Food is of excellent quality and taste. Serving portion appears small at first but just right without over-eating
5
My wife and I had the pleasure of visiting Ikyu for our wedding anniversary dinner and the service and food was excellent. Every dish was gorgeous on the outside and fabulous when it went inside my tummy. The service staff was also ever ready to take our requests and top up tea without us requiring them to come over. Furthermore, they even prepared a nice little surprise of a plate of cheesecake and ice cream with the words happy anniversary on it. My wife and I will not forget the time that we spent there :)

I visited this place for dinner on X'mas eve, and went for their festive menu at $88++. I'd previously gone for lunch, and the experience and service were wonderful. However, not for dinner service. Servings for the 6-course dinner were pathetically small, and while I'm not a big eater, they did not justify the hefty price tag. Some examples of what constituted each "course" - 2 puny servings of monk fish liver, half a lobster, 2 small servings for sushi (fish slices were thin; I don't even consider it to be nigiri), and some banana-ish dessert that was too sour. We had to order extra dishes before dessert because we were still hungry. Just to put things into context, the table next to us ordered the sushi omakase, and again I saw that the servings were tiny as well.Although service was attentive, prompt and commendable, the quality of food really leaves much to be desired. I could've gotten more quality meals from the price we paid at Ikyu. Never again
5
We had a lovely meal. Good food, nice decor and ambiance and very good service. The waiter chose our menu and it was fabulous
4
Nestled in the quaint Tiong Bahru neighbourhood, this cosy Japanese restaurant manned by locals is a good option for quality omakase meals at reasonable prices. Reservations are highly recommended for weekends.
4
Service was great, staffs there were attentive and ready to provide suggestions if needed. Great place to have a cosy meal with family and friends.
5
Great Experience. Went to Ikyu to celebrate a belated birthday and anniversary . Food was excellent and ambience was just perfect!
5
Just had dinner last night and was totally blown away. Even my guest had nothing but praises for the food, staffs and ambience.Food was exquisite, attractively presented and probably one of the freshest i had. Truffle Angel Hair was just delicious and worth every cent.Staffs were equally attractive too. Wonder if they were all handpicked? Services were personal but non intrusive. Special thanks to Vivi, Lilly and the rest of the team whom i failed to get their names, for being patient with us. This is one japanese restaurant worth multiple repeat visits.
5
Ikyu is my family's favourite japanese restaurant. The food is always good and the service always warm. Highly recommended
5
Fantastic find. The bar area has recently been taken over by two young local guys. They provided fantastic cocktails and good chat. The food was great. Highlight for me were medium fatty tuna nigiri and the US pork, which I think is the best pork Iâ€™ve ever had!
4
Very good service from the staff. Their cocktails are very nice.Their ala carte menu is generally very good but we felt their their handrolls are nothing to die for
4
The 6 courses sake pairing menu is quite good value. The food is quite yummy and we even got refills for our sake. The portion is good and no need to order extras. The ambience is more modern with lots of steel fixtures & dark lighting.
4
Can't fault the food at Ikyu each dish was of the best quality, but not quite the best Japanese we've had. Also enjoyed the cosy and friendly atmosphere despite or because of the industrial decor
5
We went on a weekday and had the lunch set which included a fried chicken salad, a main which we chose the barachirashi, and upgraded to a unique cheesecake with rum taste. It was excellent value & we thoroughly enjoyed it. Would prefer them to use reusable chopsticks instead of disposable ones though
4
Food was good, sashimi was fresh. We were pleasantly surprised by a nice discount they offered us. Service staff were warm. Will go back
4
I have been coming here the last few years. Ikyu offers good value dining and attentive and cheerful service. For lunch I like the sushi set, which allows me to have one of each kind of sushi, plus a soup, dessert (ice cream) and tea. The sushi are dainty and cute, Every now and then Ikyu offers drink pairing dinners, which are good deals.
5
Always good service and great food. Set lunch menu is great value. Great setting for small groups or lunch meetings
2
Booked a table for my wife's birthday lunch. We've only tried 2 omakases elsewhere, and one of them, Hachi, really blew us away. Given that Ikyu had a similar price point, we expected something similar. However, we were sorely disappointed. Server came up to ask what we did not eat. Told him no mushrooms and tuna for my wife. First course was soso. Staff did not make effort to explain the dish. Sashimi came next, and on my wife's plate I saw a piece of otoro. I had to confirm with the staff it was tuna before they took it away and replaced it. Rest of the courses were slow to come and came separately. The kicker was the soup that they served. 2 mushroom broths came. It was really a roll-eye moment. What's the point of asking what we do not take and not make a point to ensure these items do not get served? I really think Ikyu needs to learn what Omakase means before charging such prices
5
Food was great with a sizeable selection of dishes and very fresh ingredients. Service was attentive and efficient. Happy hour sake is a must
5
Had an intense craving for GOOD sushi and this really hits the spot. Excellent quality, great service and cosy ambience. You pay for it of course but for what you get, it's totally worth it.
5
Very high quality Japanese cuisine and reasonable priced omakasei sets. Sake is nice and priced reasonably. Chef is friendly. Best to go on Tuesday or Friday night when the new and fresh ingredients were just delivered.
5
Found out about this restaurant from an online food documentary. My all time favourite is their Kanpachi Truffle Carpaccio. The sashimi is fresh and succulent, mixed with the oil and truffle, no wasabi is needed at all as it's already lightly salted. The aroma of the truffle lingers in the mouth! I'll recommend their 5 kinds of Aburi as torching brings out the flavour of the fish better. The serving is only enough for one person. Worth mentioning that the fish slices are much bigger than the riceball. The US pork tontoro is also good if you want something cooked. Their angel hair pasta with truffle is also lovely but very filling. I always end off with their Signature Shochu cheese cake which is not cheesy at all and has the mild aroma of Shochu in every bite. This restaurant is about 10 minutes walk from Tiong Bahru Station.
4
Went there for Saturday dinner. We ordered from the ala carte menu. A few dishes to highlight: we had the mini kaisen premium don (tiny portion, overpriced at $58), aburi sushi was very good (could taste they used fresh and good quality sashimi, $35), chilled truffle angel hair (nicely done, pasta was al dente, just the right amt of truffle oil, could have added more sakura ebi, $28). The best item was the sake of the month - cloudy sake at $50 for 720ml.
4
my husbans brought me here for birthday dinner. we had the set meal. the sushi is very fresh. the staff is attentive and takes the effort to introduce each dish and give useful advice. keep it up! the place is cosy and romantic. i certainly enjoyed the meal. it's on the pricey side so save this place for special occasion or a monthly treat thing. i really appreciate the staff for changing the oyster dish to chawamushi when he saw that oyster is not my cup of tea. and i did not even request for replacement. very nice and thoughtful.
4
What a great restaurant! With lots of funky concrete and moody lighting this tucked away gem is worth finding. The sashimi was the freshest I've tasted and the corn tofu and special volcano sushi delicious. Nice selection of wine by the glass
4
Good service and nice fresh food. The price also very reasonable. The menu though is very limited. Great dake
5
Food was great and service staff were friendly and fast!!!! Highly recommended as a venue for meals.
5
Food was delicious, staff always helpful and attentive. It was an enjoyable dinner and would go back again
4
Very decent food, from chicken karaage to sashimi to sushi. Romantic atmosphere, very good service. Price is a little bit high, but not too crazy.
4
Had the restaurant week lunch menu (which wasn't really outstanding value or new - basically standard menu with add ons). Quality was still good since my last visit one year back. Couple of improvements; firstly, back half of the restaurant (layout is old 'longish' shophouse) recks of cigarettes and secondly, Shochu cheesecake was overpowering. Apart from that, a pretty enjoyable experience, just make sure to ask for seats nearer to entrance!
4
Located in the chichi Tiong Bahru area next to fashionable shops such as BooksActually, Plain Vanilla and the likes, it is a good place for casual lunch after shopping activities. You could have a casual lunch for less than S$30. We had their Grand Omakase, 7-couse for $138++ The ingredient is fresh, presentation is pleasing yet no-nonsence, taste is divine and the service is complaisantly Japanese. Except that they have two young and pretty Korean interns, who do not speak English. It is not 100% authentic Japanese cuisine, if you like fusion between Western and Japanese, this is a good place
5
We loved it - apart from the A/C being cranked up way too high (take a cardigan!) it was perfect. We had the couple's festive menu, which was SGD188 for two people including a bottle of sake (which was plenty for us lightweights!). Great value and lovely food. Would definitely go again.
5
IKYU is a wonderful mid-tier Japanese restaurant that serves FRESH sushi at a fair price. They're not cheap, but what you pay for is quality. I prefer sitting at the chef's counter as they two chefs are fun to chat with, and it is a pleasure to see them work. They have pride in their work (also evidenced by how meticulous they are when they're cleaning up), and the food always comes out beautifully plated. The main waitstaff - Donny is always attentive, but not intrusive. When ever I'm there he suggests good sake to pair with meals. A must go!
4
I went for an early vday dinner tonight and was quite excited to finally try the kaisendon I saw on my friends' fb and Instagram. I made a dinner reservation and read the menu at home and had a clear idea of what I wanted. But I was so disappointed that the uni in the kaisendon was sold out, and so were a couple of other items on the menu like chutoro nigiri. We ordered some other dishes which were very good, and I could have given a 5 star rating if the staff had only bothered to call us beforehand to let us know that some items were sold out. I felt a little cheated, and would have come on another day if I had known
4
My second visit and it was just as good as the first :)
Wonderful food and friendly service at great value!
5
Very friendly staff, each dish carefully prepared to perfection, sashimi selection is fresh, Wagyu melts in your mouth, would definitely go back!
5
Great service and food. Remember to order the sake of the day. Chic restaurant design makes the place warm!
5
I have to say, the sashimi and sushi I had in this restaurant were the best I ever had in Singapore, the staff are very nice and gave me a lot of useful advices, I ordered Shima Aji Sashimi, 5 kind Aburi Sushi and Truffle Chawanmushi, they are all very delicious. I will definitely go back again. But the price is also very high to be fair. Once a month is just enoug
4
At the recommendation of my Friend, we finally came to ikyu, well only to find out that the Japanese Chef had left. Luckily for us, the head Chef now is equally good. We had geoduck clam sashimi which was heavenly, followed by almost seemingly endless servings of various sushi planned by the Chef. Being the non fish eater, Chef had a more difficult time to satisfy my palate compared to my companion. I had a series of shellfish and shrimp sushi while my Friend had a mix of fish and shellfish. What's common between us is that we both enjoyed ourselves a lot! And the tempura was good too with really light batter nicely fried to a slight golden. To go with the food, we had a nice bottle of sake. Was a great meal! Btw, I dropped by for the lunch set menus too...and pretty good to
4
Seems hard to find a middle ground in Singapore: hawkers are very affordable and often delicious, but for sit-down meals with service it seems like you have to go very high end, price wise. The chef's tasting here is a case in point: fresh, tasty, beautifully prepared and served, but overpriced. Still, I'd recommend it if you're tired of chicken rice and want something more refined
4
My Wife and I arrived on a Friday evening no booking and managed to nab a table. This is our second time to the restaurant and we ordered the cold angel hair pasta, sirloin steak, the pork neck and some California rolls. As Japanese sushi fanatics, we didn't think the sushi at this place is good enough compared to other specialist sushi and sashimi joints but they do a decent job. The cold angel hair pasta is a nice alternative to the very exquisite but expensive version at Gunthers whilst the sirloin steak is done well. But the star of the show is the pork neck totoro grilled accompanied with rice . An upper medium ranged fusion Japanese restaurant with good copy cat dishes from other restaurants around the island but we call it upper tier comfort food.. $135 for 2 ..
5
I have been to this quaint neighbourhood restaurant a few times and it never fails to impress me. I am particularly fond of the grilled fish esp kama and tuna is just beautifully done that it melts in your mouth. From starters to dessert, you can tell that there is care in the preparation. Friendly service and value for money makes this place a must visit.
5
A couple of friends invited me here for lunch. I was thoroughly impressed. It is a bit of a small place off the beaten path in Tiong Bahru. The servers were super friendly and attentive. The sushi was fresh and presented like an art form. It was so good I thought about going back for dinner! Really delicious sushi in Singapore
5
Surprisingly good! the ingredients were so fresh and they make sure of it, that's why they're closed on the day when there's no cargo docking at the bay. The food was superb and the presentation were great. They presented a few Japanese dish in their own representation which is quite refreshing.for lunch they served lunch packages which i recommend you to try. Pick either one and don't forget to add a portion of the chef's selected sushi. it was perfect from the salad right thru the dessert. This is one place that's now on my must visit list when stopping over to Singapore.If you're planning to visit this restaurant, spare an extra hour or two because there's a lot of good book store (one of singapore's best), a few coffee shop, unique old revamped neighbourhoods, and there's also another specialty bakery just around the corner
5
Great experience , the co owner was nice food was very fresh n at very affordable prices. Great for events . Anniversary and dates !!
Cosy ambience..
5
Ikyu never disappoint with every visit! The freshness and the quality of the food served is of high quality and the servers are very attentive to our needs and food preferences. Highly recommended!
2
Service was excellent and servers were very friendly! however, food quality was bad considering the high prices.
5
Went there to celebrate my bday with hubby. Food was excelent and the 5 courses meal were delicious! The staffs were attentive and it was a nice first experience in this restaurant.
4
Order 4 set course for 48 bucks plus plus. Not bad.
Service was very good. Place is abit ulu, need walk abit from mrt.
5
We were there for a friend's birthday. We love Jap food but do not know as much so we really appreciate the staff's elaboration of the dishes. The staff was also very attentive towards us. What we love is that they customize our additional information that it was a friend's birthday. They made the last dish a tofu cheesecake as birthday cake with a lit candle and sang birthday song. And our friend and us are all pleasantly surprised by their creativity and this value-added service
4
Usually, I will either have the bara chirashi or sushi lunch sets priced respectively at S$28 & S$38. Great affordable sets that comes with appetizers, soups, desserts and coffee/tea. One of the best chirashi I have come across.Friendly service, nice place for friend to hang out
3
I had passed this restaurant a number of times hoping it would provide a good Japanese option. While the quality was very good the extremely small portions made this a restaurant I will not likely return to. We had an appetizer, the pork main, the mid range 5 piece sushi option, one rice, a bottle of water (no alcohol or desert) and left after paying about 160$. Each of the food items were well prepared, tasty and attractive but were very small especially the sushi which were easily 1/2 to 1/3 the size you normally receive. Lots of up selling but the staff was friendly, professional and not pushy. If the items were half the price or twice the size I would likely return. If you really want to eat here I would suggest looking at lunch sets
4
Tucked within the hip neighbourhood called Tiong Bahru, I love the hard industrial feel of this restaurant. Makes a refreshing change from the usual clean minimalist Japanese diner. We had the set. We were teased with a simple and tasty salad. Our main was sashimi and rice (Barachirashi), a well-executed balance of perfectly cooked Japanese rice neither hot or too cold, fresh fresh fish and pickles. After mixing it all together, paradise begins. Each mouthful was a delight and the perfect bite. Such a seemingly simple and subtlety textured comfort food. It was 'happy eating'. Dessert was matcha ice cream. I asked for an alternative and was served a yuzu sorbet. Did I mention that service was excellent too? We ordered a side of truffle oiled grilled edamame. I am not a fan of truffle oil or truffles in Asian cuisine but this was really well done. Grilled edamame. Thumbs up chef!This is the kind of place you want to revisit
4
Went there on a Sat night with my partner @ around 830pm booked through Chope. From what I understand, they have 2 sittings: one @ 6pm and another @ 8:30pm. As soon as we walked in, the front of desk promptly sat us down at the table. After a quick scan of the menu, we decided the 5 course menu @ $68++ was a good choice. It includes:i. tapas - potato salad or smoked salmon - ordered one of eachii appetizer - chawanmushi or agedashi tofu - we both decided to get the agedashi tofuiii sashimi - assortment of 3 different typesiv. main - I ordered beef with rice, partner ordered barachirashi; both came with soupv. dessert - matcha icecream but when we expressed our dislike for matcha, the front of staff promptly replaced it with yuzu icecreamvi a glass of house wine or prosecco (a sixth course for some ;)They also have a-la carte and 4 course menu option (excluding wine/prosecco & sashimi).Overall, the food was fresh, tasty and presented well. Our favourite dish unanimously was the beef - seared to perfection, soft & tender. The yuzu icecream was also a winner as was the agadeshi tofu. We did try a scoop of the matcha icecream and while we still didn't love it, it was a lot creamier than our previous attempt and we were more receptive to the taste. We also ordered a portion of the spicy tuna roll. While the taste was good, the roll itself was a bit haphazardly put together. The ambience had a date-night vibe with a red/black metal & mirrors decor with modern paintings on display & on sale. However, there was a three-generation family with children celebrating a birthday as well though I would probably not bring someone too young to this place. We paid about $170-180 for 2 people but we were definitely full at the end
4
The modest exterior in a quiet lane belies the great good and service inside!
We had a wonderful time feasting on delicious eats and chatting with the very friendly and knowledgeable staff. A must try for Japanese food lovers!
4
Only disappointment was uni wasn't fresh enough for sushi and beef was Aust wagyu ( but they did warned us about this) and we were looking forward to eating these 2 items.
5
The set lunch courses are very good value for money. Would recommend those who have not tried to go.
5
Excellent food and service. 7 course omakase was worth every penny. Would definitely come back again
5
The service was excellent and the food was delicious. One comment which is not critical would be to have some pictures or description on the menu.
4
Very good..some of the new dishes like grilled chicken wings and pho were great, as well as old ones. Will go back again!
5
Had the 7-course Grand Omakase at Ikyu and it was fantastic! Loved the fresh sashimi and sushi, super-smooth chawanmushi and tender grilled Mangalica pork. Dessert of sochu cheesecake was yummy!
1
Situated at the heartland of Tiong Bahru area, we expect this restaurant to be a hidden gem - as I saw the post by a Japanese food reviewer relating to this restaurant. We ordered the 4 course set dinner which costed around 48++.The course were potato salad, agendashi tofu, 3 pathetic thin slices of salmon sashimi!Our jaws dropped. Totally disappointing.The waitress even recommended oyster and also for the main course to be minced meat instead of sirloin - even though I also felt the sirloin was mediocre and certainly overpriced. Suggest if one wants to go for Japanese cuisine, can only visit big names like Shinji, WakuGhin and Hashida.The total bill surmounted to $120 for both of us. Ridiculously overpriced for mediocre food that one can obtain from any franchise chain like sushi tei or ichiban
4
We had 1 4 course set with kampachi carpaccio, mentaiko salad, barachirashi which is a rawfish rice bowl, matcha ice cream. I think it starts well with first course but drops off sharply! The wakame soup that accompanied this was fish broth, I found it a tad on oily side with no wakame fragrance or pieces. Then we also ordered truffle edamame - a bit of hype with a few drops of truffle oil over salty edamame, smoked salmon (done in-house they say) - this was a hit - light, refreshing and tasty, plus we tried a nightly special- a small snapper that was half grilled and half charred- it was decent but nothing to rave about, especially the price. their ikura chawanmushi was also average. Nicely priced prosecco.I liked the darkened coppery industrial ambience. However, we think if it were crowded, it would be extremely noisy as there is nothing for acoustics
4
Went for dinner with a friend and one of the best spots during our Singapore trip! Sashimi is fresh and staff is very friend that she went through the menu with us and did many recommendations. We sat by the bar watching the chef do all the work and he didn't just do a great job on food but also interacted with different customers. Will definitely come to this place again
4
Came here on my birthday and had the Omakase menu. The food, drinks, service and ambience were undoubtedly excellent and just like what many people have said about this place - unpretentious. But all of that came with a rather pretentious price tag.
2
i have higher expectations for a $162.5 meal (138++)
photos are uploaded
hachi is better and cheaper
5
My wife & I had a wonderful evening at IKYU. The oysters were fresh & succulent. The Omekaze menu was spot on. Excellent service. Great ambience!
5
Excellent food & service ! Sashimi and sushi spread & freshness was superb. Totally enjoyed our dinner experience! Only setback - the seating space is small, thus seating can be to close for comfortable privacy.
5
Good food. Very unique and good service. Located in Tiong Bahru, an old estate of Singapore which adds to the ambience.
4
Had the Set Dinner which was Very Good Indeed. The setting is very discreet yet the food quality and attention to detail shines through. Will most certainly be back.
5
Introduced to this restaurant by a friend, it's a great place at Tiong Bahru for decent priced Japanese food. Lunch sets are good value for money - I enjoy the bara chirashi set. Best to make a reservation in advance, especially for dinners. Service is fast and professional. They even help us book cabs after our meals when we ask. I eat here with friends and family every quarter, and will recommend this place to anyone
5
Dependable high quality Japanese foodSingapore is an expensive place for good Japanese- that's a fact. We have been to IKYU several times and had the omakase each time. We've not been disappointed. The ingredients are quality and fresh, the presentation is excellent and the courses are well timed. Also the same selection is outstanding. I highly recommend the sake pairing menus they have from time to time. Expensive- not for a boy's night out - but worth it.
5
“Food should be something sincere and uncomplicated,” says Chef Seki.And IKYU has done just that. I first got to try this restaurant thanks to the Citibank promotion "100 Gourmet" - and have been craving for it day and night since then. Yesterday I finally popped by for lunch. The restaurant is quiet, non pretentious and comfy. Service staff are sincere and friendly too!Food wise, authentic. Premium Kaisen Don and Chilled Angelhair are "must try". I'd love to go back to try more of their stuff. Stunning work
5
Ikyu provides exceptional service with high quality food. Ambience and decor go well together with the design of the utensils and cutlery; brings out the theme of the restaurant as a whole. Some may find it a tad too pricey but I personally feel that if you don't want to disappoint yourself with mediocre Japanese food you should give Ikyu a try. Would definitely go back again
5
Tucked away in this wondrfully interesting Tiong Bahru neighbourhood, this place it a gem.
The food is fresh, tasty, and their service is attentive and genuine.
The set lunch is well work the money.
Great selection of Japanese whiskies
5
Entered and immediately greeted. The service was also great, with a constant refill of drinks and waitress explaining each dish.
5
I am a regular customer here and I love the new menu and offerings even more than ever. Set meal or ala carte, lunch or dinner -- it's a great place to have a nice quiet chat or bring family.
4
Was here to celebrate a birthday. The staff were very helpful and very attentive to our needs. The food was great and service was very fast.
5
Good attentive service & excellent food! Enjoyed the understated ambience. Spent s nice evening! Xxx
5
Sit at the counter and watch the incredible knife skills of the chefs preparing your sushi. Great selection of sake. Owner is usally around for a chat and knowledgeable recommendations.
5
Brought my husband here to celebrate his birthday. I decided to reserve seats at the bar and it was the best decision ever. More on that later.Food:We went for the omakase. Every dish that came out was outstanding, lovingly prepared by Chef Seki and his assistant. A very small issue, and probably a personal preference, but I wished that the prawn from the tempura could be fresher and more succulent. I also ordered chawanmushi from the ala-carte menu. It's probably the best I've tried in Singapore. They were not stingy on ingredients (mushrooms, prawns, fishcake etc).Service and atmosphere:I have nothing but praise. The moment we stepped in, every single IKYU staff greeted us enthusiastically, including Chef Seki. That's why you should sit at the bar! You listen to the friendly banters between the chef, the customers and even the waiters/waitresses. When the waitress and waiters brought out the little dessert for my husband, they all sang the birthday song with much gusto. Great food, great service, great atmosphere. Coming to IKYU once is not enough
5
Have been here 4 times now, never disappointed. I have the Omakase every time supplemented by their excellent angel hair pasta with dried shrimp, roe and truffle oil. Last night's Omakase had some new dishes I had not tried which I really enjoyed (yummy grilled prawns, foie gras). Consistently excellent at each course with premium cuts like tuna belly in your sashimi and even the soup at the end is good. Desserts are not their strong suit but decent enough given you'd be stuffed by then. At around $220 for about 8 courses plus a small bottle of sake, tax and tip, it's not cheap but I do believe you get bang for the buck. If you are into sakes do try their seasonal imports
5
you should try their 5 kind aburi sushi, they melted in your mouth.the toro is ichiban with no doubt, and they also serve fresh oyster from irish, french and australia which contains the taste of the ocean.the angel hair was cooked in perfection.Last but not least, their waitness are very kind and polite and introduce each kind of food to you before you taste their foo
5
Had a delightful omakase dinner with family last Sat at Ikyu. Our enjoyable chat with Mr Seki definitely made the experience more memorable. The free flowing of a variety of alcohol for S$50/pax during happy hour is great value. The food quality & display were excellent. Definitely recommend a seat at the sushi counter
5
Best Japanese food in a long time. Slightly over-served - no need to clean the table after every course, but minor quibble. Just great quality food, terrific menu and choice, and beautiful ambiance.
4
Food was very well executed, although portions could be somewhat larger. But the real star of the place was the service, which was truly excellent and attentive. I went for dinner; will definitely be back in the near future!
4
My first visit to Ikyu. The staffs are friendly & the food are rather impressive. I think I'll come again, with my son who is living in Japan.
4
terrific food. Family atmosphere. Wine list very sparse and noise level a little high. We had a reasonably large party and were very well taken care of. I would recommend for a casual evening or lunch.
5
We live around the corner from Ikyu and have been a here a few times, but not often enough. Food, service and ambience are great (recommend counter seats). Its definitely a bit of a splurge, but for Singapore prices, I was a bit surprised at how reasonable our billed seemed on this last trip even with a bottle of excellent SA wine
5
Read many good reviews of this place, decided to try it.The food is very good. Sashimi is fresh and good. The dishes are tasty, pretty and ample. The sake is good too. The ambience is very romantic but the tables are a little too close to one another. The service is very good and attentive
4
In the hipster enclave of Tiong Bahru is this little Japanese fusion restaurant. The service here is very good and the chefs are Japanese which gives the food a level of authenticity. If you come at lunch you order one of the sets which are very reasonably priced around 30 and at night the omacase meal is also a 7 course meal that the chef selects for you. You can also order extra alacate or order directly from the menu. Will come back here again. The service is pleasant and friendly.
4
One little street, a few trendy bistros, Art deco low rise units. This is pleasant Yong Siak St. Ikyu is definitely another pleasant surprise, good food préparation, be it sushi, flamed or not, or more fusion cuisine but always with japanese traditional kick. Decor is neo post industrial and is just fine. Service is attentive and cool. Prices are décent for a japanese restaurant. Definitely a place to go, my preference is for dinner and a little pre digestion walk afterwards in rising Tiong Bahru neighborhood
5
It's fusion or that's how some would call it ... but it doesn't detract from the fact that it's good. In fact, it was superb ... my son had no words to describe the angel hair pasta in truffle oil, shrimp and Ikura - and that's unusual for my normally opinionated boy! We loved the amberjack in truffle as well and the miso soup, a 'common' item in any good Japanese restaurant, had egg ribbons in the subtle broth. We would recommend the grilled beef as well and the rice bowl that had tuna belly, and uni or sea urchin in it. Overall a 5 out of 5 for us. Service was also great - Ivy really took care of us and explained the intricate details of each dish. Props to her for making our lunch even more pleasant

Ikyu has an industrial chic look with a well priced set lunch menu. The appetizer and dessert changes every time I visit so you'll never be bored. I love the Chirashi-don, it's always fresh and has shreds of shiso leaf that I can't get enough of. Service here is always top-notch.

Wide variety in terms of food at very readonable prices considering the high quality of the menu.
Great service and ambience! Minor detail: last accepted reservation was at 7:45pm so it feelt like and "early bird special".

The only thing that marred the experience was the group of middle aged women sitting next to us that spoke and laughed so loudly.

Unpretentious restaurant along the row of shophouses - a real surprise! We were greeted loudly upon entering - no reservations but still got seated for 2 for a last minute lunch. We picked the set lunch. Appetizer was a 3 piece dish - salad with seaweed, fried octopus rings plus a pumpkin mash - delicate and enough. My mains was the 7 pce sushi & rolls - toro, hamachi, salmon, ika, mackerel, snapper, eel & a slice of crab/cucumber roll - very fresh tasteful sushi! My son had the charcoal grilled salmon which was delicious. The pickled white radish was quite refreshing too! Both sets came with a miso soup with seaweed & mushroom caps. Dessert was green tea ice-cream together with either tea or coffee. Everything ended with a hot green tea. Service staff were very friendly, ultra efficient and we will return to try everything else

Located in a very trendy part of Tiong Bahru, Ikyu is quite the trendy, hipster type of Japanese joint. I came here once for lunch and once for dinner and both times, the sushi was excellent and the drinks were very good. The sushi counter is very small and intimate and I think could probably be reserved for regulars. We didn't get a chance to sit there but at the normal tables. It was very tastefully designed and the food is fresh. It wasn't that cheap but I did enjoy the experience of dining there. The upside is that there are loads of places to go for coffee and desserts around that area, especially after lunch

Ikyu has a unique interior industrial design. It gives u the fashionable yet u know u come to the right place for authentic Japanese food.I like omakase style. I juz leave it to the chef to plan my menu. Everytime i am delighted to see what will b on my plate. Quality is so fresh n portion is generous. The waiting staff are all very friendly n helpful. The sushi chef named Alex is very knowledgeable abt the diff type of seafood n the way he make the sushi is juz amazing.

Made the effort to visit Tiomg Bahru for lunch in order to try Ikyu. It's about a 10 minute walk from the mrt which is fine provided the weather is good. Opted for the chirashi sushi set lunch at 28++ and the 3 sake sampler at 18++. Starter, miso, small dessert and tea or coffee were all included. Food and sake were very good. Great value for money and worth the effort to visit

I never expected sushi in Singapore to be particularly reasonable, but this place really wasn't so bad, value-wise. The restaurant itself is a little more industrial/urban-chic than you'd expect from a sushi place, which is fine, just not my style. The sushi was wonderful, and the kitchen dishes really made me smile - even though they're not as glamorous as the sushi, you can tell that a lot of care goes into their preparation. There was a persimmon dessert that absolutely blew my mind - I think was soaked in liquor for ... months? I asked, but language barriers prevented me from getting a full explanation. I'll remember that persimmon for the rest of my life! The sushi chef was very friendly, very jokey. We did not have a reservation

Had a wonderful time. Great service by the chinese lady, full of warmth and gave good recommendations! She sure did help to make the experience a great one. The food was really very well prepared. We ordered from ala carte menu and every single dish was delicious!! We had sea urchin, kobe beef, scallops, etc. All the seafood was really fresh. We enjoyed every single dish. We will be back. :

The restaurant seating is nice and modern and we sat at the sushi bar, entertained by the young chef. We started with the grilled truffle edamame, then had different kind of sashimi and sushi which were tasty ; and a cod that was too small for my appetite :)It's located in Tiong Bahru, a cool area of town that is gaining a lot of attention lately; discovered it on http://www.citynomads.com/reviews/restaurants/254/the-nomad-guide-to-tiong-bahr

Went during Singapore Restaurant Week (one of 5 places visited, the other 4 being: absinthe, table at 7, forest and Olivia Cassivelaun Fancourt).I am not sure if its just me, but I am sure the quality of restaurant week menus (not just here, also at the other places) has gone down. Previously I believe they showcased some of their very best dishes, perhaps at cost or even a loss, in order to get repeat business. But nowadays, it seems they are putting together more budget menus so they still make some profit. The menus just seem more mediocre these days. That goes for all 5, possibly with the exception of absinthe which imho was the best of the bunch, but not by far).Anyways, I didn't find the food particularly outstanding (maybe a la carte is better?). I found the beer very expensive. The most interesting thing is the decor

Poor quality of food and ingredients and a cooking that reminds more of a hospital canteen than anything one could call a Japanese restaurant.
However music, decor and service are impeccable. But is that enough ?

Vistited IKYU for lunch. We were lucky to be seated in the sushi bar, where we could watch the chef making food. Started up with different kind of sashimi, grilled truffle edamame beans and finished with a set lunch menu with sushi.Next time in Singapore I will definitely visit IKYU for more outstanding food

Visited IKYU during restaurant week and was pleasantly surprised. From the restaurant week menu where varied options were presented, my friends and I managed to try different choice. we each chose the cod fish, wagyu beef and pork. Each gave us it's own surprises. wagyu was nicely done and tender to taste. staff were attentive and very polite. Warmly greeted at the door and subsequently taken care by good staff. One kind gesture was that they took e initiative to cook a new bowl of somen when I was unable to enjoy my somen promptly as I was on the line. Good job!Nestled in the rustic environment of Tiong bahru, visitors will sure find other gems there.

If you like Japanese food, doesn't get better than this.Went here with a local friend.Firstly we got seated on a table, we did appreciate the decor and waiters are very polite and tried couple of dishes such us truffled edemame beans.We then asked to be moved to the sushi bar where the chef was live cooking, and this is where the show started.Chef Takuma and his staff have been truly a prefect host and they prepared for us a set of sashimi and some sushi, both of them delicious.On top of that they are super entertaining and make the all experience absolutely superb.A must if you are in Singapore. Japanese restaurant at the top.I suggest to book a seat at the sushi bar and experience the live cooking show

We found this place by accident after purchasing books from the charming Wood In The Books store next door. We were warmly greeted, seated and the staff were able to recommend excellent choices. For lunch we had half a dozen Hokkaido oyesters, the Hotate and finally Foie Gras. They went very well with the Biwa Beer. For desert, the staff recommended the Melon ice-cream for my young child and also the chilled Sake for my wife and I.Overall, the food was very well prepared and the notes of subtler tastes were definitely hidden but found. I will definitely return for a meal if I am in the area again

Having been to Tokyo just a few weeks ago, it's hard to say "excellent", but Ikyu was definitely a very good experience at least for Singapore. We opted for the omakase, which began with a series of amuse-bouche, the one of which I was most interested being the monkfish liver (last time I had it was as Ryugin in Tokyo more than a year ago). This rendition was good but not mind-blowing. Next came the sashimi, which was decent, with the standouts being the abalone and perhaps the oyster (other cuts were rather standard fare). Next came a pumpkin dish with a something-mushi on top and prawn: this was a very interesting dish (texture wise). Next we had the wagyu dish (v good) and cod (ok), followed by sushi (refined, small pieces tokyo style) and finally, an amazing dessert (and i'm not a sweets'person): a japanese rendition of the Mont Blanc: extremely solid. Service was very careful and yet non intrusive.An omakase with half a bottle of sake will set you back a couple hundos singers, which is not cheap but you won't leave hungry nor gastronomically disappointed

The food, the service and the ambience were just beyond belief. Everyone from the maitre'd to the waiter to the chef had a great sense of pride of the food and the restaurant. The restaurant is in a cool neighborhood that has so much history. We always prefer sitting at the sushi bar and the chef will just do what's freshest. Excellent restaurant and we were lucky to have found it!

Was running late and partner didn't even make it but staff were very understanding and wasn't angry that I had to cancel one person's business.Had omekasei (S$128+taxes), was fantastic, so much food and delicious too! Drinks were constantly being topped up, food comes out evenly timed. Every staff in the restaurant were fantastic and they even called a taxi for me and ensure I was safely in the taxi rather than leaving me out the front. Definitely will go back to this little gem if i'm in Singapore

3 course set lunch was value for money for $24++ with an appetizer, main & dessert with tea or coffee.Quiet place for lunch with attentive and friendly service staffs. Rustic & rugged designed restaurant with a Japanese chef.My friend who brought me there told me that the variety of sashimi used for the chirashi don changes over time depending on what is fresh and available.Great and interesting neighborhood with interesting shops to check out before or after meal

The food is really comparable to the ones I ate in Japan. It's delicious and flavorful and cooked to perfection! Love the attention given by the staff who gave several food recommendations! I even spotted some celebrities there when I was dining! Little surprise as the chef used to work under a prestigious Japanese restaurant and he has his group of faithful followers, who adores his food
