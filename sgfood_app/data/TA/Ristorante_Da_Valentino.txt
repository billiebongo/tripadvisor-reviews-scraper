It feels like Italy. When you are almost growing up in Italy it feels like Home. I love the place. Thanks

Our go to restaurant every year for Italian food!! Love their squid ink pasta, burrata cheese and lobster pasta
5
Overall the experiemce was fantastic. Food is fantastic with good service and the ambience is great.. Would definately be back here again for next occasion.
5
Cosy Atmosphere for a meal and the service by the staff were great. The food was nice and was even told by the staff we ordered enough for 2 (Pretty good for us in case we over ordered) . Overall recommended!
5
Had the crab pasta & my husband had the grilled lamb. Both were delicious. The service was very attentive too! Place was full on a Tuesday night!
5
This place is run by an Italian family and has been around for a few years now. It serves the best Italian fare alone with an unparalleled wine collection.
If u want the best Italian in spore, Look no further

This place is without a doubt one of the best Italian restaurants in Singapore. I was so unfortunate to have only tried it now.A restaurant run by an Italian family, I felt I was walking into an underground cellar as I came in. The main dining area is big and spacious. The stars for the evening though: the food and the service staff. Not only were the waiters always on hand to refill our glasses, they even went out of their way to help us as we had our 2 month old baby girl to tend to through the evening.Our table was filled with delicious Italian dishes (burrata, parma ham, ciabatta, calamari, pizzas, panna cotta). Our top picks were, however, the squid ink fettuccine with crabmeat, and the fettuccine with prawns in Saffron sauce.One down side is the fact that it is one of the harder to locate restaurants at the Grandstand. Best route is to turn right where the cage football pitches are, then make a left and go straight till the end to find a small parking area just in front of the restaurant.
5
I have always heard about this family-run restaurant are so I decided to pay a visit. Eaten linguine with clams and lobster pasta too, truly delicious....pasta is cooked the Italian way...al dente, which is excellent. Desserts were good too, I recommend the semifreddo; bruschetta should have a little more garlic spread over the bread and chopped tomato could be a little more seasoned however the food was tasty, simple and authentic so this restaurant definitely met my expectations
5
we just reached home and can’t wait to get my finger in putting in a review of our lunch today. we were at turf club and our friend selected this restaurant by random. we were lucky to have a table. obviously we did not make any reservation since it was a random choice. the food tasted excellent. the siciliana fish was wonderful. the fish meat was tender and fragrance. the sauce was flavorful. the salad drizzled with olive oil on the side was fresh. i wish there’s room for desert. next time, perhaps. yea, we had an expensive lunch but with such great food and service, they were reasonably priced. we will return again!
5
This is an amazing restaurant, fantastic food and gracious, attentive service. It is expensive, but for that special occasion, it is well worth the price.
3
The food is delicious and reasonably priced. Definitely worth the visit. The lunch buffet priced at $45++ is worth the money
5
Best gnocchi I have eaten ever. Authentic Italian restaurant. Service prompt but a bit too prompt, was hoping to sit for a while before eating the next course! Amazing bread is provided gratis.
5
good ambience with nice layout, good for couples,families or group of friends. excellent lightings creating a conducive environment for dining and bonding.
4
feels as if transported to Italy! atmosphere and staff werr friendly and homely...food and wine were awesome!
5
LOVED the place and the food. Neatly tucked away from the predominant Singaporean hustle and bustle, Valentino's offers hearty Italian food that is sure to satisfy everyone's taste buds. Had the best burrata and panna cotta in the city. The food is divine and traditional with a bit of modernity. The mushroom risotto with saffron was heavenly. Loved the salad with pine nuts, burrata, penne arrabiata, marinated artichokes and the coconut gelato. By far the best Italian fare I have had in Singapore. Highly recommend the restaurant! They have gained a regular :
5
8 of us arrive during lunch time and we let the chef pick for us..well - it just superb super quality with a great services from the host .. like a family staythank you for a great hospitality which is very rare in singapore to have those original warm service
5
Went there to celebrate my sister's birthday. Food was extremely delicious. Staffs are friendly, approachable and jovial. They gave advise/suggestions on how to enjoy the food better. They celebrated my sister's birthday lively. Overall, it's a beautiful, yummlicious and happy lunch we had! (: Highly recommended!!
5
Valentino’s is our favorite family restaurant. For us it’s all occasion place and we’re there at least once a month. Hosted my mother-in-law to dinner on Sunday. For starters we had the grilled octopus, Bromio Salad and the baked eggplant. We ordered 2 portions of the grilled octopus (because we like it that much!!). Succulent and it was grilled to perfection. Highly recommend this. The Bromio Salad is also an all time favorite. The garden mix with pine nuts, apple slices, cheese and olives is a refreshing summer salad. For mains, we shared a crabmeat pizza. It’s slightly spicy, topped generously with fresh crabmeat. My wife and I had the baked sea bass fillet. The fillet is freshly sliced and oven baked for 20 minutes. Serves on fresh tomato slices and greens on the side. Highly recommend. My mother-in-law ordered a crabmeat pasta which was done with a light tomato based sauce and the fresh crabmeat made all the difference. Ye children ordered a seafood risotto, king prawn pasta (a special for day) and a crabmeat squid inked pasta. They all throughly enjoyed their mains. And indeed it was the quality of the seafood that really made the difference. The staff are knowledgeable and attentive. Kumar and Priya, the seniors there never fail to make us feel welcomed. Highly recommended for anyone who wants to enjoy a great Italian meal and fantastic ambience.
5
As usual, Valentino goes extra mile to make our meal special. When we entered, we were greeted by friendly family members of the chef. Food wise it's always spot on. Loved the carpaccio, vongole, pizza and crab meat pasta in pink sauce. Wine selection was amazing. Staff surprised us with a birthday cake upon learning we went there for a birthday meal
5
The buffet lunch is fantastic value and you can eat a good range of delicious dishes. I love the crab meat pasta and miss it when I'm not in Singapore!
5
A little pricey but really great value for food! - Good cuts of meat and the grilled octopus special for the day was yummy!
4
Great pastas.
There are some well priced dishes. But I tend to avoid chef's recommendations as they can be quite expensive. To steer clear of too high a bill, stick to menu items.
4
Food was exquisite, though pricey.
Selection of wine limited.
Service was attentive and commendable.
The only complaint was the female toilet was dirty and messy (due to a faulty flush), else it will be a near perfect experience.
5
I am vegetarian. Food quality was great . Every single dish was of outstanding quality......although the portions of Risotto and Pasta was a small. Pizza and desserts were of decent quantity. Service was very good and the ambience was outstanding.
4
Came here a few times for celebratory meals. I like the homely, friendly ambience. Just like some italian restuarant in florence. We had the fresh oysters which was that day's special, although fresh, i think they were overpriced. We ordered the burrata, nice but could do with more of the balsamic vinegar bits. Risotto was very good. We had the tomahawk, also excellently done. I love the panna cotta with just the right consistency and level of wobbliness. We also had the freshly made donuts as dessert. I found the service staff, although friendly, but tried to hardsell us some daily special items. I thought it sounded abit pushy. And at a nice restaurant, they shouldnt be doing that. Overall, i would come back since the food is nice and reasonably priced.
5
We had emailed our booking from UK before the trip & all was confirmed. Due to heavy traffic & a taxi driver not totally sure of location, we were 10 mins late - we were lucky as our table was about to be given away!This is a positive comment in that the restaurant was buzzing & space could not be wasted. The food, ambience, experience was a joy. The local staff were a little too enthusiastic thinking us greenhorn tourists but it was a thoroughly good evening with great attention to detail
4
Located at Grandstand and used to be known as Turf City, this authentic Italian restaurant is run by a Italian family. The walls are covered with photos of VIPs and celebrities. The quality of the food lives up to the hype and the service is impressive as well. The menu is quite comprehensive, requiring more visits soon ..
5
I have read many of the reviews and am humored by those who had a less than pleasant experience. My family is actually from Ticino (Actually Switzerland) but very familiar with Northern Italian cooking. The Risotto Milanese is very authentic which is difficult to find outside of Milano! The last serving of Risotto I had that was this good was sitting on a roof top in Milan looking at the Duomo and conversing with my wife. The Buratta is exquisite if you love creamy deliciousness! Panna Cotta for dessert is always a favorite of mine and if you like Panna Cotta I think you too will enjoy it. The staff is very attentive, the wine is authentic and enjoyable and the owners are a wonderful family for anyone that is willing to get to know them. So if you are looking for traditional Northern Italian food this is a great choice. Remember that you are one half of the experience so if you walk in a Stugots you probably won't have a good time but if your heart is light and you are friendly it will be a night to remember
5
Valentino had always been my personal go-to place for Italian food. Brought my family here for a casual dinner and it became their favourite as well. I need not recommend as all their food is amazing.Wait staff are well informed about the menu and always ready with recommendations. Try it - I strongly recommend this place!!!
4
Fantastic service. Make you feel real comfortable and at home. Mushroom soup and lobster pasta were really delicious. Will be back!
5
The pink sauce pasta is the best so far. Either with lobster or king prawn, the taste is best. The service also excellent with their friendly waiters and owner. But the price is a bit over priced.
5
Services was fantastic and homely decor. Ink paste with crab is my Favourite..... they make perfect bread to go along with burrata cheese... yum
5
We truly love eating at valentinos because the wonderful variety of food and the pleasant atmosphere. The staff and food never disappoint.
5
So far this is the best Italian restaurant in Singapore for me, the service and taste are just so consistent over he years. Fresh produce are brought in seasonally and The Chef can just whipped out fabulous dishes. A place to check out for sure ! Free champagne and oysters for ladies on Tuesday!!
4
I'm a big fan of burrata cheese and the burrata here is better than the burrata at my favourite restaurant, No Menu - it has a really creamy texture and so full of flavour, served with balsamic vinegar pearls. I had the crab with squid ink pasta and while the pasta and sauce were delicious, I was a little disappointed that the although this is one of their signature dishes, the crab didn't taste very fresh. The restaurant is really far from central Singapore and it was difficult to get an Uber home after dinner. We spent $800 between 4 with 2 very nice but expensive bottles of wine.The service was alright, no where near the homey feel of No Menu. I'd definitely return for the burrata.
5
My first visit here and I have nothing negative at all to say about this wonderful restaurant. I managed to make a reservation via their Facebook page and I can gladly say that their response was always prompt! Upon arrival we were greeted by warm staffs and food was deeeelicious. The Mixed Mushrooms in Butter Garlic Sauce (around $22) was a good appetiser to start with.Their Lasagna was delicious too with generous amount of filling. We also ordered a Birthday Cake from them. The cake was yummy and definitely worth the price that we paid. Highly recommended especially if you are having dinner for special occassions.Average cost for 2 pax : $150(We had 2 mains, 1 appetiser, 1 cocktail, 1 Beer and also a birthday cake
1
While the hot ciabatta bread served with our selection of cold cuts was v good, the burrata was very average. The main courses left much to be desired. The dory fish in lemon sauce was swimming in oil and butter. So was the spaghetti with pork. This was pointed out to the waitress (who was v attentive and polite otherwise) had a v lukewarm response and was surprised I said what I did! They seemed to have a very good wine selection.
4
Celebrated a friend's birthday - fun experience as the wait staff was really attentive and friendly Enjoyed the warm ciabatta - crusty yet soft! The refreshing sweet melon taste was helpful in cutting the "porkiness" of the prosciutto slicesThe burrata was extremely creamy and literally melts in your mouth. The datterrini tomatoes were awesome - grilled to just-rightness Grilled octopus tentacles were too small a portion but the tenderness and smokiness were well balancedFresh lobster linguini done aglio olio style were yummy but too small a serving portion for four of us to share. The half a bottle of wine was shockingly pricey but have to admit the wine was an easy drink and smooth Indeed $$$$ but the quality of the food is undeniably good
4
This would be a place to impress someone as it has really authentic Italian food - some dishes are just available on the day itself depending on what's fresh that day esp for seafood dishes.It's got a great selection of wines and good desserts, though I found the chocolate pantone a little too sweet for my liking.You can order any dish on the menu and you pretty much can't go wrong
3
Good drinks and wine, but the food is certainly over-rated and does not commensurate with the price.
5
all depend on your expectation
food was superb and a bit pricy.. for worthed to try
good service and thank you for the team that make our time during lunch time really superb
5
Valentino has always been our go too for special occasions. We love how homely the interior of the restaurant feels. Their squid ink pasta and burrata cheese deserves special mention!
4
The food here is great and their service is even better. The staffs are very friendly and willing to explain in details what are their signature dishes and what special dishes they have on that particular day.
4
I will start by saying that I cannot comment on the pricing that others have mentioned as this was a business dinner paid by a client. Having said this I thought the whole experience was excellent. The service was first class, and the food very very good. Mozzarella can be one of my favourite or least favourite foods depending on the quality. Here it was extremely good. I would definitely return
1
Valentinos has been a go to place for me for authentic Italian pasta, even before their move to the current premises. So this is a shock to me over how their practices have changed over the years. I brought a special lady to this place as she'd requested for good pasta. The service from the waitress Priya was good, as she rattled off the specials for the day. We decided on crab fettuccine, my old favorite, but my date wanted something with meat. We were suggested a wagyu meatball fettuccine, which we accepted. For starters, we ordered another special, vongole in a small pot. Everything arrived, and was good as always. Vongole was fresh, my pasta was consistently good, and her pasta was also nice, other than the dry meatballs. Their sauces are sooo good you see. Imagine my surprise when the bill came. For a pasta with 2 meatballs, they charged $38.90. They say wagyu was used, but I'm not sure wagyu meatballs come that dry. The bigger shock was the vongole, which was charged at $42.90. I'm not sure how they justify that one, given the comparable price to Boston lobster. Well, I paid the bill, because I didn't want to kick up a fuss with my date. But I won't be back again for sure. PS I also saw they double charged me for two juices. We only had one.
1
Where to start? The entire experience at Valentino was a disappointment. First - the decor is more suitable for an easy/inexpensive place rather than one which is definetly on the higher price range - it looks tired and cheesy. Second - the wine list and cellar are the biggest joke. Built for those who don't know much about wine but are probably intimidated into ordering a mediocre wine for inflated prices. Third - the food. Again, if you enjoy paying high prices for mediocrity and tiny portions you will love this place. Fourth - the service, obsequious and pushy. Singapore has amazing Italian restaurants - this isn't one I'm sorry to say
5
Probably the best Italian food I've ever had...and I live in San Francisco, have traveled to Italy, and love to try Italian food anywhere I go. If you are craving traditional, delicious, Italian food look no further. Friendly staff, excellent menu, and a ridiculously good wine list. Try the prosciutto with melon and Burrata, the Risotto Milanese, and the Osso Bucco for a 5* meal
1
At least Dick Turpin wore a mask ......I already wasted 2 hours of my time in this place so I will keep this short. They boast a fine selection of wines , but they dont have a wine menu so this is where the scam begins. The water approached with a hand written note with 4 wines from the Barollo area of Italy which were really of the lesser estates from this area, but wanted 120 Dollars. Wine is expensive in SG, but is taxed on per litre irrelevant of the quality of wine, so the mark up they are charging on cheap wine is ....HIGHWAY robbery.Continuing with the theme of highway robbery , they charged 24.90 for an eggplant roll ( involtini). That was literally 2 slices eggplant, thats the same price as a main course pizza....how can you justify that price? I am just skimming the top of the iceberg here.The waiter had'nt a clue and kept hovering over the table as if he was mandated by the manager / owner to sell or up sell without having any knowledge of the wine or food, by the time we got our main course at 9.40 pm there was nobody left in the restaurant and now 3 waiters had decided to hover around the table - obviously they wanted to get out the restaurant as soon as possible , and to be honest I dont blame them because thats exactly what we wanted to do too.I don't like writing bad reviews and hardly do, but when restaurants like this want to take people for a ride well then I will
5
If you want to know where the smart locals go in Singapore for outstanding Italian food, look no further than Da Valentino. Oddly located in a sports club locale, this restaurant is perfect in service and the quality of it 's Northern Italian cuisine. Valentino came out of the kitchen and counseled us on his favorites and even took our order. We were not disappointed. Such a surprise to find food this good amid such a warm and relaxing environment. Our server took us to the restaurant's wine cave and we were able to choose our wine from so many good choices. So wonderful, I would export this great find to the US if Valentino would accept (he won't). Go, enjoy, and tell others. Just terrific!
5
The ambiance was great and the food didn't disappoint. We chose the a-la-carte buffet. Absolute value for money. Everything was delicious. I especially enjoyed the burrata that came in little servings. A great way to start a lazy Sunday.
5
Located in a beautifully forested area in the turf club offers the best burrata in town! Perfect atmosphere good for any kind of occasion! Love the staff!
5
Friendly staff, great food and wine selection, you can't be disappointed coming here with your loved ones! Yes, there are many Italian choices in Singapore, but this is one of my favourite!
4
A good dinner for different Nationalities guests who all were comfortable with the goods. In addition, great service, nice ambience and good foods. Well stocked winery which guests enjoyed too. Shall be back again for authentic Italian foods.
5
Fresh Italian food air delivered weekly from Italy, extreme care in the preparation of original recipes, a super warm welcoming as in best Italian small villages, all in a nice environment. We were a group of 20 people for an excellent and useful business dinner in a dedicated roo
5
I ate so well that I almost couldn't move anymore. The pizza was very good - flavorful and light. The pork chop was succulent and perfectly grilled. The special order filled donut was a wonderful surprise. Papa, Valentino and the entire staff made our dining experience even more wonderful with their hospitality and kindness
4
We tried the food on the a-la-carte menu with a family of 4. Overall we were pleased with the quality of ingredients (grilled octopus was really tasty,great burratina with tomatoes), enjoyable pizza and pasta well liked by the kids, and well executed main dishes (lamb chop in marsala wine was succulent). Worth trying: squid-ink pasta, lamb chop and classic tiramisu. Note that the price is a bit on expensive side even if i can appreciate the quality ($300 for 4 with no wine)

My colleague had highly recommended this place for a group of us (7 in total) to celebrate the yearend Christmas season lunch. It was a good start and we chose the $45++ buffet as it provided good variety. We also ordered wine to accompany our meal. However whilst the menu with the dishes was printed on one side of a laminated A5 card, there was fine print on the back side which warned that food wastage would be charged at $5 per dish, without qualifying what would be considered wastage. The menu cards were placed with the dishes facing upwards. Whilst my colleague ordered for us, the laminated menus were quickly whisked off the table without my colleague noticing the warning behind, nor the waiter highlighting this warning. Whilst the atmosphere was enjoyable, the food was passable. We ended up not finishing at least 3 small slices each of two 8inch pizzas - which were not as good as our Neighbourhood Peperoni's and Spizza. When my colleague was subsequently informed of the charge, he was highly surprised, as were most of us. Whilst the Chinese waiter who served us was trying his best to explain and mollify us (we were in shock), his Singapore Indian colleague assumed a more superior position and was arrogant in his explanation, stating that the warning was behind the menus, especially when we informed him that the Chinese waiter who took our orders should have highlighted this, instead of coming over to suggest other dishes to order.Moreover, when we inquired what was considered food wastage (as there was no qualifying criteria), the arrogant waiter stated that our 8 pieces of pizza would be considered as such. After qualifying that the eight pieces of pizza left belonged to 3 different pizzas, the arrogant waiter then stated that anything more than 3 slices left behind would be charged. To make matters worse, when my colleague requested to speak to, and gestured to the Italian owner (who was looking on) to come, the owner chose to ignore him and walk away, leaving his staff to handle.Honestly, the extra $10 (ie $5 per dish) to the bill was not a big dent for us, but the attitudes of the arrogant waiter and the younger Italian owner in not coming over at least to listen to a customer's explanation was highly disappointing. I had previously frequented this restaurant when it was first located at Rifle Range Road, and was pleasantly surprised to find it again this time at Turf City. I had declared to my colleagues that I would bring my family one of the days, but the sour ending of this lunch and the attitude of the owner has gotten me scouring bad reviews of this restaurant from Trip Advisor as well as other food blogs and making me think more than twice. Whilst most of the bad reviews commented on the mismatch between the price and the food quality, my main gripe would have to be the attitude in customer service...it is no longer the nice family owned restauranteur that greets and listens to its diners, but the commercial attitude of a business owner too busy to listen to the feedback (however unpleasant) of a diner. There was no more sign of the warm and friendly Italian family that I used to see at the original Rifle Range restaurant.This caused us to be subsequently unhappy over the slightest of things including the fact that the dessert was limited, with the favorite tiramisu all gone by the time we finished our main meal.Food wise, only the fish and the beef cheek, and the pasta dishes were good. The burrata was good too. The pizza was passable. The attitude on the whole sucked.. there are many other Italian restaurants in Singapore which not only give you excellent quality of food, but you will also leave with a full stomach and a pleasant dining experience complete with good customer service, smiles and listening ear.
5
Without a doubt the food at Valentino is excellent made better by the excellent consistent service. Tucked away in Tuff City, it is beautifully furnished and very spacious. Even going to the restroom is an experience in itself. A great place to entertain business associates, friends or to have a relaxing and enjoyable meal with the family. I love the sign that reads 'save water drink more wine'. The food had been consistent over the years. Our favorites are the T Bone Steak, the Burrata and their cakes. Remember to save space for desserts. Typical of many good restaurant are pictures of the who's who, who have been there. From the many pictures it appears that the Late MM Lee Kuan Yew frequented Valentino often. Just one small advise, Singapore water is safe to drink, don't need to ask for bottled water
5
Relaxing and cosy, yet elegant, "Italian home setting" sum up the ambience of Valentino's. We had a Baby Shower cum way-in-advance Christmas dinner here on Sunday night.As there were 4 of us and my expectant daughter-in-law had a craving for pizza and dessert, we ordered these to share:Frutti Mare Pizza- prawn, squid, scallop & clam;Carnivoro Pizza-sausage, bacon and salami;Braised beef cheek risottoMinestrone soup;Traditional mixed salad with apples, nuts & ricotta;Cold cuts selectionCiabatta with pesto dip (2 helpings and both were complimentary)And for dessert, we had the Lava cake, Panna Cotta and Torta Valentino (dark chocolate cake + rum)Service was excellent- attentive but not intrusive! As always, I would like to give my sincere appreciation to the deserving service staff, in particular, Marlon. He was very polite from beginning to end, taking time to go through with us the specials for the night which were off-menu, the list of fresh juices with my daughter-in-law and topping up our flutes with the chilled Proseco. Not mentioning other service staff who brought bag hangars for our handbags and kept our umbrella in the cloakroom, almost immediately after we were seated. Ah...then there was ever friendly Alberto who greeted us warmly upon our arrival and ushered us to a waiting bench while our table was being set up.We have been long time fans of Valentino's since it was at Rifle Range Road. What's amazing is that moving from a 45- seater to a 134-seater restaurant did NOT affect the quality of the food nor the service level!Overall, an Ooh-la-la experience!!
5
First time to visit. Came very highly recommended by friends. The food and service were excellent. I can't really understand why they are not more highly rated.
We will be coming back.
4
Second visit to this restaurant and we found the food was fantastic, and the staff were friendly and helpful. It can be a little hard to reach if you aren't driving, but its worth the trouble!
5
An excellent family restaurant. Relocated to larger place since my earlier visit. Good food. Staff guidance, very useful. Well stocked bar. Exceptional service. Will surely go there on my next visit
4
At their new location at Turf City, it is gorgeously furnished and wonderfully spacious - even the washroom had a sitting area for resting or as a private chatroom! The food and service was consistently good, especially the alio olio with polpo, and the tiramisu was excellent by Singapore standards. Access to the restaurent is from the outside at the end of the block. Valet parking is available.
5
This is my second time dining at the restaurant, I just love it so much!It designed to be warm like your own Italian home, even you aren't an Italian.The owner is a nice and warm family, they back to back to cook, serve and greet you personally sometime even when the servers are attending your table. They even bother to ask us verbally how were our meals, it felt there's no gap between the owner and customers.I love Italian food but it never truly felt so great of love like this restaurant especially in South East Asia. It just pouring love from every corner of this restaurant.If you're lucky enough, you can see the owner families from the oldest to the youngest sit down together and have the meal of themselves! It shouts quality, means that nothing comes out from the kitchen is bad.Numero Uno! Cia

Food here totally blew our minds. Everything was perfect. We had the buffet lunch and were able to sample a number of the dishes - from appetizers (like the burrata, mixed mushrooms, ciabatta, etc) to the pizza (Margherita, Carnivoro, Salami & Olives), to the pasta (Seafood Aglio Olio, Squid Ink Pasta with Crabmeat) to mains (Risotto with beef cheek, fish fillet) and even dessert (tiramisu, creme brulee). Everything was tasty, freshly prepared, absolutely delicious. Out of everything that I tried the squid ink pasta with crabmeat was the superstar. Pasta was al dente, sauce was exploding with flavor. Service from the crew was awesome too. Great value for money. When in Singapore, you HAVE to visit this restaurant to experience their food. Your trip just won't be complete without it.
4
Went as a family - this was great... Burrata, Bruschetta, Garlic Bread, Arabiatta, etc etc. Lovely flavours, eager service & the desert buffet was the ultimate 'cherry on the top' with Biscotti, Creme Brûlée, Tiramisu ++. All in all - fantastic .. a tad on the pricey side & always call ahead to avoid walk-in disappointment. Will go once in a while when we feel like getting pampered !
5
From its service to its quality of food, Valentino's never disappoints. It may be a tad out of the way for those who don't drive, but it's well worth the effort getting there. The squid ink linguine is done to perfection and the burrata is fresh and flavourful
5
The birthday girl chose this place as she likes the dishes here. We've ordered the burrata cheese, squid ink luiguine, grilled Wagyu & grilled pork, garlic bread, tiramisu & chocolate ice cream cakes & some other appetisers for a group of 7 pax. My favourites are the squid ink pasta, grilled pork, garlic bread & tiramisu. Ambience is great, I would come back again. Oh, one more thing, the toilets are veryNicely decorated & spacious. Chk it out when you're there
2
Mediocre. Staff tried to upsell everything, so a pleasant dinner was partially ruined & no something you'd expect from a restaurant of Valentino's. It was obvious that staff were under pressure to deliver revenue. At best, some tried. At worst, they walked away in disdain! And, please, at these prices, we do have lots of options with better food & much better service.
3
The food is ok, not amazing, a bit over priced for the quality. Service is poor, or almost non existent. Will not come again.
5
Menu is great, I felt that I'm dining in Italy. Selection of wines are impressive.
Service was very precise and all the staff were attentive, fast and very friendly. It's worth the price!
4
Really good Italian food, very nice spread on the menu (especially their burrata salad & Apple-pear-pinenut salads). Flexible kitchen for adapting to vegetarian dishes. Friendly valets and good space & ambience. Tad expensive - but worth it !!
2
The good: good parking outsideExtensive menuGood menu for kids if you bring themGood wineThe bad: the service was awful, no rapport, in a rush, no ambienceThe mozzarella and tomatoes could had been from any low cost supermarketThe stakes were good, a bit too oily.Overall, won't come back, rather go to any of the other Italian restaurants in Singapore with better ambience, Otto, OSO, no menu..
4
Visited on the 11th Sep, nice ambience. Food is good, nice pairing of wine. The staff is attentive to details, he asked you for your budget and recommends the wine. Good place for a celebration and for special occasion. Budget about $80 per pax without wine.
5
Whenever I visit Valentino's, I always feel like I'm back in Tuscany. The warm, bluesy Italian jazz weaves itself throughout the homely, spacious setting of it's location at Turf City. They have recently started serving a buffet menu for $45++ per pax for adults, $25++ for children, which has pleased my half-empty stomach very much. If I had to recommend anything, I would recommend the Burrata Cheese and the Squid Ink Pasta. It is also absolutely one's life mission to try Chef Perla's fluffy and absolutely heavenly tiramisu.For such an authentic and hospitable experience. it's not surprising that such a steep price is attached to it. Still, this is a great place to treat yourself to a slice of Tuscan countryside in cosmopolitan Singapore
5
Best Italian restaurant in Singapore run by an Italian family. We visited it for my wife's birthday. First thing that catches the eye is the authentic deco and spacious rooms. Burrata & tomatoes was awesome, pizza had a thin crust and was perfectly baked as a true Italian pizza. Finally, tiramisu with a birthday candle was a perfect pinnacle of our evening. All in all great experience and we certainly will be back! PS: reservation highly recommended, we didn't have one and were very lucky to get the last available table

Tucked away at a corner of the Grandstand, Singapore former Turf Club is this authentic Italian restaurant managed and run by a group of friendly Italian family. The extended Valentino members would make an effort to mingle, checking if you are comfy and happy with the food quality, chit chatting with regular patrons. Because of their friendliness, warmth and very Italian ambience, I felt as if I have teleported into a fine dining restaurant in Italy. Here, my bestie Fun, spent almost S$300.00 for a 2 pax, 5 course a la carte sans wine dinner birthday treat on me.We ordered four Chef recommendations (item numbered below as 1, 3, 4 and 5) on the menu. Namely, 1) the fresh seafood & tomato soup $20.90, 2) cold and hot cuts at $25.90/pax, 3) spaghetti with Mediterranean scampi & sweet tomato $26.90, 4) Pope style Mediterranean sea bass with white wine & vegetables $58.90, 5) Pistachio dessert and 6) ice cream dessert and 7) some imported Italian sparkling water. The food was truly fresh and tantalizing to our tastebuds. In fact, it's so delicious that we loved almost everything served except... for the cold and hot cuts (Antipasti Fantasia @$25.90/pax) it was a tad too boring & simply overpriced. The pistachio dessert was something I would want to live for, I cannot recall what is the Italian name for it, please check out the attached pictures as reference if you wish to order it. The pistachio taste so natural and it just melted in my mouth. :)Apparently, they make only a limited quantity and only on some days so please call the restaurant ahead of time to check and order. If you think it's too expensive at S$150/head without liquor, may I suggest you go for their lunch buffet. It's only S$45.90++/pax Mon to Thurs. DO NOT opt for al fresco dining coz you be feeding mosquitos + facing a plain yucky concrete surrounding. Call ahead to book a seat! Enjoy! :)

Location is a little not so convenient within Singapore, but there are shuttle buses from Clementine and Toa Payoh.The food is nice, the service is great. I ordered Crabmeat pasta and asked them to change the squid ink fettuccini to Linguine. They did.Ordered their Garlic bread, Tonnato and Moscato wine and had Hazelnut Gelato for dessert.Price is rather steep for A la Carte, so you may want to take their buffet instead
5
First time to eat at Ristorante Da Valentino and the food and service were excellent. Great selection of wine from the wine cellar. Great "family" Italian dining experience. Just like back in Italy. I would highly recommend.
5
One of my all time favorite restaurants and a must visit if you have the money and the love of authentic Italian. Family atmosphere makes this perfect for a small celebration, a big gathering with friends or to round off a team workshop or away day. Great little private dining room makes a perfect venue to host your own dinner without the hassle. Also great for a romantic dinner for 2. Great wines, excellent pastas and a burrata that mustn't be missed!
5
There aren't enough nice things to say about the staff and service at Valentino's. You truly get the sense of being welcomed into a warm Italian family home and everyone, from the chef to the waitstaff are friendly and helpful. On recommendation from the chef I had the beef cheek risotto which was cooked perfectly and very tasty. Husband had chicken and sundried tomato pasta and said it was 'awesome' - I have to take his word for it as he wouldn't share any. All in all it was a wonderful warm experience and we will definitely make this one of our regulars
5
First time having the lunch buffet which cost $45/++. Must say its value for money compared to the usual ala carte. Portion is small but you will get to eat more varieties to your heart content. We had few serving of the ciabatta bread, it's really Shiok!  We also enjoyed the squid ink pasta very much, the braised beef cheeks and braised pork cheeks are very soft and yummy! Super loved it!The ambience and feel of the restaurant is very Italiano, bringing Italy right into this restaurant. The waiter and waitress have been faithfully working there for several years and service are top notch! You will always have your drink glass filled.

My wife and I visited Valentino in June, to celebrate my birthday. My last visit to Valentino was many years ago when the restaurant was located in another location at Rifle Range Road.We went on a Tuesday evening and it was reasonably full for a early week night. We ordered a fried seafood appetiser, two different pastas, a cake and ice cream for desserts.Overall the food was of a high quality, staff were friendly and offered good recommendation, and nice ambience for a relaxing dinner
5
Keep going back to Valentino's! For ladies, the crabmeat pasta is delicious and worth a try. I believe it is one of their most popular dishes. Burrata (not in the menu) tasted fantastic, with small little balls of vinegar, coupled with cherry tomatoes. Tad on the pricey side but worth a go! Don't forget to pair it with a glass of wine. :)Service was topnotched too
5
What a treat Valentino's is! Once you step inside this rustic yet modern restaurant, you feel as if you've been transported to Italy. From the host to the servers to the decor, there is a friendly old-world feel to this place. We started our evening with a beautiful Prosecco while standing at the open-air bar. Once seated, the most challenging part of the evening was deciding what to order from the menu. Filled with a myriad of choices of traditional Italian antipasti, salads, pastas and pizza, two of our party of four went with mishroom pasta dishes, one chose a seafood pasta, and one chose a meat lasagna. All tasted great. There is no wine menu at Valentinos - instead, we were invited to the wine cave where we picked out a two nice bottles of Chianti. It was a fantastic evening of good food and wine. Note: this restaurant is not for those who are wallet-conscious (it is a bit pricey), but if you are looking for a restaurant where you can have a relaxed, fun evening with friends, Valentinos won't disappoint

We have been patronising for many years, with many dinners and parties, but recently we had worst experience of our life, Senior Owner was offensive, insolent, discriminatory, argumentative, condescending, passing inflammatory comments, discourteous & disrespectful to us & in presence of our 7 dining VIP Guests. Definitely RUINED our Birthday evening. And just a night before we had spent $$$$$ on another birthday dinner for 14 guests. No Guest should be treated in such ill-manner where you spend at the most expensive restaurant in Spore and get insulted by owner. I now can definitely agree & endorse with the other reviews on this page, definitely Pretentious and Expensive. We were definitely misled as well-heeled & discerning Patrons to stay loyal for so long to such an over-rated establishment. We and our Foreign and local friends certainly will never patronise Valentino ever again, and will go with our long time favorite & consistent Hero of Italian Food from quality to ambience to food, price to service and most of all, so gracious as an owner, OSO Italian Restaurant, Owner & Manager Stephane - hands-down a 5 Star Rated Italian restaurant in Singapore

Salt is the dish of the day apparently. Pizza = Salty Fish = Salty Bottle of Merlot = $120 and mediocre at best Bread = salty There are better choices in Singapore at the same price. Don't be fooled by pictures of the rich and famous on the walls! Anyone with basic knowledge of Italian food would know this isn't what you'd call "a true state of Italy".
1
The place is a trap. As an Italian living in Singapore, I was missing a good pizza and decided to pay a visit to the place. MIstake! Terrible service (we waited our pizza 90 minutes) and mediocre food. Final bad surprise: 480 $ for two people having one pizza, one pasta, two antipasti and two whiskeys..... I keep the receipt, in case you do not believe it...
5
We dine here and they have excellent staff and service. The wine list is extensive and valuable. We will come back again. True Italian Food.
5
Even better at its new premises! Lovely ambience even if the space is much larger. Very cosy feel. Food remains top notch.

2 x couple dining. We shared 2 starters and 4 different pastas, 2 desserts.The place ooze of "fine dining", with waiters at the ready for every table, however they loiter around most of the time, flicking wine openers The food was boring and small portioned. The food may seem different, than the local Asian cuisine, but none of the original Italian taste. The main pasta dishes were cooked up in what seemed like 5 minutes, which would probably explain the absent of taste in the dishes and the lack of nice arrangement. My taste buds were bored. I even had a better dessert at an Italian chain restaurant the following day, at a 1/5 of the price. The price are in no way justified by the food, taste or ambiance. They actually declare in the menu that large amount of leftover food will incur additional charges on the bill. They should themselves be charged for small portioned meals. Just a pretentious Italian setup, thriving among the abundance of local Asian food.. I guess if you make it look expensive people will think it's good by default
5
WOW!!!! What can I say - Am spellbound.Mouthwatering dishes. Am not going to spoil your minds to say what you should be having as it would not do justice to your palate and the restaurant. This place delivered one of the best Italian dishes with an amazing wine to complement it. The food reminded me of my trip to Pisa when I visited a family run restaurant there.The buzz is so Italian. It of course comes at a price but that is what you pay for - but with an exemplary service from Priya (my mistake to assume that she was from India - she is from Fiji) and Kumar it was all worth it. RESERVATION IS A MUST - Place is closed on Monda
5
It was my first time to dine at this restaurant and I understood why Da Valentino is an all-time Italian favourite restaurant. It is a family-run venue with mama Valentino present to greet you. The menu range is extensive and the 3- and 4-course meals apparently popular. We went for the 4-course meal, the servings were substantial. The pasta were al dente and flavoursome. I particularly enjoyed the squid ink pasta with crabmeat. The meat dishes were generous and enjoyed the pulled pork. The wine cellar was fun and the waiter was helpful and knew his wine. Service was polite, attentive and friendly without being intrusive. Overall a lovely restaurant and a favourite given the wall of fame photos of celebrities and politicians. The chef took time to greet his guests which was a nice touch

Food is definitely authentic as its, Italian food by Italians! That itself is a novelty nowadays. We had a vegetarian selection of burrata cheese salad, tomatoes so nicely marinated,, Egglant starter, margarita, Pesto pasta, our friends tried the calamari, steak and squid ink pasta and they were very pleased too! I loved the Ravioli the most. Good, helpful, courteous service by Priya. Overall very good food thanks to chef/owner Mr. Valentin

Was here last Friday for dinner and we were 4 of us. This is a family run restaurant,Italian of course and the food was quite good though not rising above average. We had vegetarian so that's what I am referring to. The rocket salad with apple and the buratta cheese salad were both very good. The pastas that followed were not bad though at best average. Deserts too were good but overall nothing extraordinary. May be I am visiting too many Italian restaurants
5
This restaurant is run by a family who greet you as you enter and make sure that your dining experience I reaches your expectation. We had a full dinner that started off with the best wines, appetizers, soup, salad, pasta, fish, pizza, and steak. Everything was scrumptious and the service was superb. We had 2 waiters assigned only for our table and rendered extraordinary service. The experience was truly remarkable
5
Very warm and professional service. Been here a few times as a treat for myself. Would love to eat here more often but put off by the prices. Personally feel its the most authentic italian food you can have in Singapore. Quality is amazing and very consistent.
4
You would be pushed hard to find better Italian food in Singapore than Valentino. They have all the usuals - pasta and pizza - the staples - without being particularly edgy, which is why, I think, they tend to attract more elderly patrons and families. It's traditional Italian fare done to perfection.If I have some criticisms. The décor is looking a bit tired now. A bit of investment would not go amiss. And the décor is rather hotchpotch. Sometimes that can be endearing but this time I think they could do with the eye of an interior designer.Another criticism I have is that I noticed that the staff absolutely fall over regulars or people spending a lot on an expensive bottle of wine. It leaves other patrons feeling a bit like second-class citizens.Third, I'm not sure what to make of Turf City. The positive is that there's never a problem parking. But let's face it, the whole complex is a shambles. All of the other restaurants in Turf City are several cuts below Valentino's. You've got the car dealers. It shouldn't detract from the experience of a meal there - but it kinda does
5
Very Italian flavor of interior with good food and services. Pastas, oven baked sea bass, grilled squids and all are good choices we are having. Very recommended. Make sure book in advance to get the good dinner time.
5
Superb location, Superb ambiance and interior and great food also. Overall, a very good restaurant. One of the better Italian restaurants I have visited ever.
Definitely recommended and I will visit again.
4
Went there for a family dinner yesterday evening. The appetisers and main courses were all very good and so was the service. Restaurant has a very pleasant decor and ideal for both adults and teenagers. Somewhat pricey!
5
Spacious yet cosy restaurant in Turf Club Road. May be hard to find so as you drive along Turf Club Road, turn right into this small road that is just before the large gantry. Signs to the restaurant will then be seen. Lots of ample open air car parking. It's not just the food but the whole experience - Makes you feel you are being hosted by a very warm hospitable large Italian family! And indeed it's Valentino's whole family including mama, papa, sister Perla and her husband who ensure you are made to feel welcome. Burrata cheese with tomatoes, grilled octopus, tuna spread with slices of toasted baguette, spicy sausage penne and seafood fettuccine were great. The tenderloin steak was succulent. The desserts are made by sister Perla and are just delicious - panacotta with raspberry sauce, creme brûlée and coppa amarene. Service is warm and helpful.
4
Overall, the ambience & food was pretty good. Service was excellent & the people generally very friendly with that touch of Italian family hospitality. Even Mamma came out to check if we were enjoying their food. So did Chef Valentino & his bro-in-law GM.Having booked for a romantic evening, we were seated in the la cave table. The Burrata was fantastic & so was the home-made pesto dip with ciabatta. The pasta was nice & the veal fillet with Parma ham was excellent. Desserts were nice but we kind of expected more from reading reviews before coming.All in all, a good place to have great Milanese style cuisine.Plan to come back again with the folks
5
Went back to Valentino's after quite a while and the food and atmosphere is still as good as ever. Service was good, atmosphere is really nice and the food is good as ever. Really good pizzas (try the Carnivoro) and pastas (excellent Carbonara). Overall this place is always a good choice for Italian food in Singapore
3
A hidden Italian place. Food is good, although portion could have been bigger to satisfy our tummy. The servers were over-eager to impress, piling the food on our plates and not giving us space to truly enjoy the food and enjoy the company of family and friends.
2
We went for a New Year Eve Dinner. The quality of the food I must say is acceptable and comes with pleasant ambience. However, I think I owe it to the readers on my experience here. The waiter will come and offer you some 'off the menu' dishes and never warned you on the exhorbitant price that they charge on these dishes. For example, a plate of salad that comes with some exotic cheese (did not mention its exotic) can set you back as high as SGD48! A price that is even beyond a normal main dish.Hence I have to say this really spoiled my New Year Eve experience with them. I truly believe if the waiter (His name is Rico) wants to recommend an expensive dish, he has to pre-warn the customer. Notwithstanding the food is not bad, I would not visit again nor recommend to friends because of the questionable ethical practices in the restaurant
5
It's a fixture on my speed dial. Warm service coupled with consistently great food. I love the Fettucine al granchio, a superb dish that has yet to meet a rival in my books. The squid ink umami coupled with the sweetness of the crabmeat is a sure winner. So far, everyone that I have recommended the place to comes back with raving reviews. Sure it's not the cheapest, but its affordable and I always have a good time
5
For a special occasion, Valentino's is well worth the splurge. A family run affair, multiple generations look after you, as well as an extremely well trained staff. And the food and wine list are magnificent. Always order the burrata, some of the best on the island. And when in season, the fettuccine with an egg and truffles (3g is plenty) is worth trying. You can't go wrong, but be prepared to pay for the quality.
5
Valentino is my go to place for Italian food in Singapore. Yes it is expensive but it is well worth the price. This last time I took my colleagues and boss to the restaurant and the restaurant did not disappoint. The burrata was fantastic as always, fried calamari and shrimp was delightful and fresh, but it was the main that sealed the night. We ordered 1.3kg tomahawk steak and being he first time I ordered it I did not what to expect. In the end, it was divine. Nice charred in the outside, tender and juicy inside, and chock full of taste with every bite. It was the perfect choice of cut, seasoning and skill. It was so good one friend just had to chew the meat off the bone
5
The menu is fairly extensively. We were having a hard time deciding until the staff came by with the specials of the day. We decided to jus go with the specials which are off the menu.Starter was mozarella cheese with tomatoes. Main was a 1kg T-bone steak. The steak was cooked by out table on a hot plate. Chef was great! Gamely posed for pictures! Even greater was his cooking. He did some parts of the steak medium and some parts medium rare as we rquested. He decided on the doneness of the tenderloin, leave it to his professionalism n u can't go wrong. Condiments served were minimal n simple. But i suggest leaving out the condiments entirely to savour the simple yet robust flavours of their food. The staff are knowledgeable and made sure that we are happy and comfirtable. The Cianti recommended was wonderful n paired perfectly with the steak.Tips:1. Go for the daily specials if you can't decide.2. The location is a trifle hidden. Do your homework if you are trying to impress your guests.3. Book in advance
2
On the plus side, the staff tried to be helpful, especially in reconfirming the reservation. Apart from that, however, this restaurant is over-rated. Are the staff commission-based as they were too keen to push the pricier wine and food. That may be acceptable if there was genuine interest in ensuring that we experienced that best that the restaurant can offer, relative to the occasion and our preferences. But no questions were asked, The lack of interest in the customer is most distressing; it was just very transactional with none of the flair and grace expected from a high end restaurant. There were also too many staff who do not seem to be communicating to each other, so we had 2 different wine recommendations. We ordered the burrata for starters, followed by pasta and pizza. Whilst competent enough, its presentation and taste were very average. Lastly, the decor is rather outdated. So, overall, nothing in our experience justified the higher than premium pricing
4
Visited Valentino together with colleagues for business lunch. It was always pleasant and food is great! This isn't our first time visiting. I love the fact that the staff can still recognize us after awhile. You will noticed that the entire family is in the business! Food is consistently good. We will sure to visit again.
4
Valentino and his family are around to entertain you with their welcoming suggestions.. The food is superb, the tomatoes in oil were so fresh and great with paper thin cut Parma ham , the 3 pastas crab, seafood and carbonara were excellent, Frito Misto thinly battered and crisp, the deep fried cheese rolled in Parma ham was a great appetizer while the focaccia and basil in oil dip kept me asking for more, the seafood tomato soup was like a stew, the burrata cheese was so fresh and so light , the pizzas with Parma ham and cheese and tomato and cheeses were so good, the salad was crisp with a light and tangy olive oil based dressing and perfect before the beautiful steak Florentine which was 1000 gms - huge and perfectly grilled with some rocket greens on top..we ordered too much but it was well worth it. The wine selection was excellent and the service was superb. We had a personal wait staff by our table all throughout dinner who knew what kind of wine to pair for each dish we had. Kudos to Mr Valentino and famil
4
The interior feels like an Italian family run business in New York. The place is amazingly busy and you need to make a reservation. Valentino personally to your place and greets you which is such a nice gesture. We loved our appetiser the barrata cheese w tomatoes. The following pasta and main course dish was a bit too heavy and personally too much on the salty side. But I would go again and try something else as the whole atmosphere and service is really unique for Singapore.
5
Located at away from the central area, this place makes you feel like you were invited to a dinner with Italian family. Don't need to be dressed formal even though this Italian restaurant is so famous, but still a place like you wanna go with your favorite shirt on. Services are friendly enough to let you so relaxed. One of the Favorite restaurant
5
I wasn't quite sure what to except, but this is authentic as Italian gets. It's family run and this keeps the quality of food at a high level. 5 times I've been there, and all 5 times the quality is still amazing. If you want a great starter, have the buffalo cheese and tomatoes, its to die for, melting in your mouth. I don't have anything negative to say. They are accommodating on the mea as well if you need changes. MUST GO!!! Plus the prices are unbelievably reasonable
5
Did not believe my daughter when she said the finest Italian restaurant in Singapore, of her choice.Told her how fine can any Italian restaurant get beyond Pizzas Pasta etc..I had to not only eat but swallow my words.Excellent atmosphere with food par excellence.Must for anyone who would love fine dine Italian cuisine.Not to be missed
4
I have been at Valentino for several times and every time the food and the service are extremely very punctual. All staff have an eyes on you with a lovely distance. The head chef is very friendly and welcoming. The food i have tried many dishes and it is very good. And if you are open mind person i would recommend you to let the chef make the choices for you.
4
Warm, attentive and personable staff. Very good food. Worth a trip to try if you have yet to do so. Start with the warm bread that is served. I do enjoy their pasta and several of their starters.
5
Great Italian dining experience in Singapore. Food is excellent, owners are incredibly friendly and inviting. Worth the trip to find this spot outside the downtown area.
4
Decor, menu and even service are reminiscent of a bygone era - certainly at odds with most of Singapore's options and this what makes all the charm of this place - not always perfect and not always polished but enjoyable nonetheless. Food is very good and waiters, whilst a little gruff in appearance, are actually good at what they do.The one downside could be the location - Turf city is becoming a rather dreadful mess with appalling parking facilities and traffic jams almost every weekends... so that certainly would limit visits
3
Valentinos is well located at Turf City and there is plenty of parking and a valet service. The decor is very traditional (old fashioned some might say) and will not be to everyone's taste. The service is excellent. Almost (not quite) to the point of being intrusive, but it's a fine line...On to the food. The food was overall very good. Their complimentary garlic bread was excellent, crispy, crunchy, hot and full of flavour. We shared the vegetarian platter. It was over oiled and under seasoned. The veg had not had sufficient time to caramelise. It was a small portion to share and at $25, too much for the ingredients. We shared the fresh lobster with linguine aglioli, which was excellent. The roasted garlic was a lovely accompaniment and the lobster was delicious, sweet and fresh. Finally finished with espresso and coffee. The bill was expensive. No question. I am sure the ingredients were fresh and highest quality etc, but without even a glass of wine, this was an expensive lunch for two. This makes this restaurant an occasional treat rather than a place we would eat regularly. Overall, the dishes seem to average about $10 more here than other places we have eaten in Singapore. The deserts looked fab, but it was lunch and we did not partake. This in itself is another aspect the management should consider. There was no set lunch menu for those who do not want a 3 course a la carte lunch, the menu is so extensive that it is almost too much and baffling to the customer, a Specials board would help to sell the dishes of the day and also help the customers who can't remember the 5/6 dishes rattled off by well trained staff.
3
I went there with my husband to celebrate our aniversary. Since we didnt have time to book a nice rest in advance, we decided to go close to home. The service is good and they have a nice ambience. However the food is average, nothing special. All about the same of what you can expect of an average italian restaurant but more expesive. Desert was nice.
4
The food has ranged from a 3/5 to 5/5. Great ambiance though. Waiters can be a but snarky at times but it adds to the experience. They can do a lot of customization but here the waiter quality makes a big difference. I've had some say yes to a dish and others say no
5
Being Italian, I was not exactly excited when I found out that an Italian restaurant had been booked by the group I was with in Singapore, but I was certainly proven wrong! The food is delicious: simple, flavoursome and made with good fresh ingredients. The wine list is great, which is not so obvious in Singapore as I learnt over my stay! The service is efficient, polite and friendly - Alberto helped us with all our requests with a smile. I would strongly recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants real italian food....even if it is in Asia!
4
My family celebrated my brother's birthday here and we had a lovely time. I had the squid ink fettuccine and he the veal shank, both excellent. Our server was prompt and attentive, and we went on a weekday so the restaurant was not crowded which made for a much more pleasant meal. The ambience is my favourite aspect - its setting was sumptuous and beautifully lit, and the restrooms were nicely decorated. For sure the prices are a tad steep but it was worthwhile splurging on a great meal for a special occasion. Before we left, we spent some time looking at the photos near the entrance of the restaurant's notable diners
4
Great Food. Sea bass so delicately cooked is probably one of the best I have eaten in a very very long time. Their desserts are a must try as well. Pasta - even though the menu promises to be light, felt a bit heavy for me. Ambience is nice and there is a wide range of wines to select from. All positive. Only Area of Improvement: There is a fine line of difference between a knowledgable staff and someone who is kind of selling stuff. Even after I insisted on being a light eater, I was kind of coaxed into ordering more than what I should have. And the same staff, tending to the table next to where I was seated repeated the same behavior. As i saw some frantic waving of hands, and then heard them cancel items from their maincourse, as they felt mid way that they had ordered more. May be its just 1 staff who is going overboard (one fine gentleman with moustache). But for the price that one pays to experience the fine dining here, it may well be worth the attention of the management to correct this. Will come back for food. But will be very wary of 'upselling' by the staff next time around
5
Have been planning to go to this restaurant for last 4 years. As last minute decision could never get a table. This time made a booking. It is none of the best Italan restaurant have been to. It is a family run. They seriously take interest in their customers. Make it a point to ensure the customers do not have any issues. Staff is excellent - very friendly and have good suggestios. Menu choices very good. Considering the quality, service and ambiance, prices are reasonable. They have specials for the day which unfortunately not listed - verbally told by the waiter - so don't know the prices. Thought wines were slightly over priced. Desserts were excellent. It s now on my must eat at places ever time I am in Singapore
3
Not the best of Italian food I've had but credit should be given to the good service and nice ambiance here. Service staff are highly professional, attentive and engaging. Food was ok but given the price level, must admit it was a little disappointing.
4
Celebrated my wedding anniversary with my wife with a dinner here.Made an online reservation and there is a no-show charge if you cancel the reservation 24 hours before the reservation. But I did receive a call the day before my reservation to confirm.I must say that the ambiance and service is very good.The food taste good as well, but offers average value at pretty high prices.Portions are indeed slightly on the small side
4
Proper home cooked "mama" italian food. Honest and hearty unlike the majority of "try too hard" fine dining (??) italian restaurants in singapore where they think insipid small portions on ridiculously large square plates and high prices make the food more sophisticated. Property simplistic combinations are perfectly executed here with excellent produce. Thoroughly recommend this as it is consistent due to the fact the owners are on hand when you done here.
4
We have been to Valentino's and number of times. Quality of the food is always consistent and of a high standard although I would agree portion sizes are quite small.Our last dinner for 3 with a bottle of wine (S$120) was S$420. We all had starter and mains but no dessert...so its certainly not cheap but what you would expect from a restaurant of this standard. Service is very welcoming and efficient.I prefer sitting inside the atmosphere is better...
5
Visited this place again after a while. This is my favorite Italian Resto in Singapore! We ordered our favorites, octopus salad, burrata and fresh clams in white wine for starters. Had fresh sea bass, pork medallion with lentil. They'd served their freshly baked bread with pesto and our wine was a 2000 white, chilled to perfection! Wait staff are all very nice and professional. The Chef, Valentino himself was personally attending to us because my friend Ann is a VIP here.Had a great dinner and will definitely be back
3
The food was indeed good, but we left hungry from such small portions. The prices for pasta were acceptable, but when we saw the price ($60) for an appetizer special recommended by the server and not on the menu, we felt really taken advantage of. We later found out this is not uncommon, so make sure you know what you are ordering up front if you don't want sticker shock at the end. I would have ordered differently if I had known, and would have enjoyed the whole dining experience more. Ambiance was OK but not exceptional. Service excellent, but I suspect it was more to get us to order more
5
I always thought that this is one of the best italian restaurant, its definetly not on the lower range of $$, but if money is not an object, then this one is probably one of the best. Starting with the bread and pesto sauce which I think is really good and continue with buratta cheese and the spaghetti pasta with alio olio mixed with seafood.. I like valention himself to create the dishes, so its something unique off the menu. Dont forget to Finish off with tomahawk beef and tiramisu. Thats my favorite here
1
I must say that I was very much amused by this restaurant. I was so ridiculously disappointed that I actually recommend this restaurant if you want to have a good laugh. You'll be stunned by the service which looks professional at first before revealing itself to be an unapologetic and brutal sales machine aimed at grabbing every dollar from you. The waiters will push you to the brink to make you buy a bottle of wine. Some of the most overpriced bottles in Singapore. They will catch you off guard to ask if you would like some Ciabatta bread before you discover at the end of the meal that they charges you S$6.5 for a bread basket you barely touched. They will make you feel bad in front of your guests saying "Is that all? You know the portions are really small..." as if you were willing to let them leave with an empty stomach. Guess what? The portions are not small and we ended up not touching the additional dishes you pushed us to order. I can go on and on about this place but don't want to spoil the surprise. So I recommend this place if you are looking for a good entertainment
2
We came here to change from the excellent addresses we love to go to in town such as Amarone or Osteria Mozza. We were impressed with the traditional decoration and atmosphere. We were disappointed with the service, the quality of the food and the prices. A thumbs down for us, we'll stick with our usuals!

The place has a rustic charm of a family trattoria altho the ambience is not quite that, probably because of its mostly 'on company expense' diners and array of merchandise for sale.The Bormio salad is one of the best I've had in restaurants. The sauces of the 2 pastas we ordered were way too rich for our liking, and quickly became rather unappetizing when they were not hot anymore.The staff had a good service attitude, I ranked them above their peers in the same price category restaurants
5
This restaurant should be ranked in the top 5 of Italian restaurants in Singapore. All the food we ordered were perfect, made with fresh ingredients, and seasoned just right. The pastas are to die for. Try anything that says "mama's recipe" ..... yummy.

An excellent and authentic Italian experience with great ingredients prepared well, the wagu 'tomahawk' and also their risotto are exceptional. Attentive service and a knowledgable guide through a comprehensive wine cellar add to the experience. Unlike many Singapore restaurants where the exorbitant prices are not backed up by an appropriate experience, at Valentino's it is good enough to feel that it is well worth the expense! There are even genuine, not 'copy' Italians
5
This is a refreshing place in Singapore - it is real Italian food, not fiddly, fussy, trying-to-be-trendy nonsense like some other places. The waiters are delightful. Valentino is charming, friendly and really cares about you. The food is delicious - highlights included the pork chop and the T-bone. Puddings aren't the most exciting but everything before that was fantastic

I had heard how great the food was - who hasn't? It was NOT bad but it wasn't great for the price we had to pay. We ordered: 2 starters (1 half portion of cheese, one roasted veg)2 mains (all pasta & not steaks) 1 coffee 1 dessert The portions were small.And it all came to about $160+. I call that overpriced. The food did not send us over the moon either. I don't understand what all that fuss is about. Service was okay, not great. Setting/ambience was again so-so
4
We went to Valentino's for a team lunch. There were 18 of us. We called up the restaurant in advance and they were really very helpful in providing us with suggestions on what we could order - the Christmas set menu or the a la carte. They also suggested to us to pre order some items.Their a la carte menu is really extensive and there is a large variety of dishes which cater to vegetarians.For starters we ordered the Buratta cheese, Parma ham with melon, grilled veggies, calamari and salads. My personal fav are the first two ... so simple yet so delicious.Main courses are plentiful and of course most ppl went for the pastas. I went for the squid ink linguini with creamy tomato sauce which was simple but extremely tasty. I don't think anyone had a bad word abt any of the dishes.For deserts we shared the chantilly cake, the creme brulee and the panda cotta. The panna cotta has to be the winner for me and I'm not usually a fan - smooth and silky with a rich vanilla flavour.The restaurant dishes out rustic italian dishes which are simple but consistently tasty and you can tell it's real italian fare. Nothing drama and fancy in terms of fluffing up the dish with foam/flowers etc but really relies on freshness of ingredients and generations of culinary experience

We were considering a few Italian places to celebrate our birthdays and toyed with the idea of going somewhere else, since we've been to valentino when it was at its previous location. and we were glad we stuck to valentino. perfect pastas! I think if we are there again we'll just order the mains and share it, cos the pastas are more "wow!" compared to the appetisers, we find. can forget about the soup. Cos nothing in Singapore compares to the soups we had in Italy. We were also glad to find that the prices seemed to have remained more or less the same. wine was pretty good. waiter gave us a sampling portion when he saw me finishing my glass.good service. good to go for lunch. place was spacious and not crowded.

Valentino is one of the best Italian restaurants in Singapore.Had dinner with a big groups. The food was of good quality. The pasta and the steak were excellent. Service was good. The only catch are the prices. It is really expensive considering what are you are getting. Alas, this appears to be the trend in Singapore
5
We were eating family style where we ordered few dishes and shared them. I had my first and possibly last foie gras there. It was delicious and it didn't have that "liverly" smell. I won't eat it again though, it's my choice for humanity for the ducks. And i think their best dish was the pasta! It was cooked Al Dente, the way I like it and the cream sauce wasn't overly creamy. The service waa excellent and all of them there were very friendly.Definitely will come back for another special occasions
5
This is probably the only Italian family run restaurant that give extra service and feel so family oriented. Chef Valentino himself always come up and talk to the customers. Their beef and pasta are excellent, the pizza also simple and good. I happened to know him because I ate there few times in the past months and he can create dishes very quick and serve it beautifully, that's what a good and creative chef is. I really recommended this place
5
Always good food, wine and service. Always have to drop by when we are in town, very convenient. Must go to place for good honest steak and Italian wine. Enough said!!!
5
Had my birthday dinner here and the food and service was absolutely impeccable! It was incredibly memorable. The wine lists was also extensive.
3
They should not serve a generic Nebbiolo as a Barolo. It is cheating !! I do not appreciate this at all.

Ristorante da Valentino's is an institution in Singapore. They have been at the current location - Turf City for the past 2 years with bigger premises and a decor with many authentic Italian decorative elements that makes you feel like you are dining in a private wine cellar.When you enter the restaurant, do check out their 'Wall of Fame' where you see chef Valentino and his family (who helps out in the restaurant) posing with important people (Ministers, Celebrities - Jackie Chan and even FIFA President - Sepp Blatter), and you know you wouldn't leave disappointed after a meal here.I have been to this restaurant several times in the past year and always enjoy my meals here.I came by for lunch recently, and here are the highlights of my meal:- Fresh bread with Sundried Tomato and Olives: The bread was fresh and warm when it reached our table. The sundried tomatos were sweet and the olives were yummy. I love it. - Alio Olio Sphaghetti with Garlic and Mushrooms: Pasta was al-dente and simply tossed with garlic (which I love) and sliced button mushrooms. Thumbs-up!- Ravioli filled with Veal and topped with veal cooked in tomato sauce: One word - Yummy! I am usually not a fan of Ravioli but this was good.- Margherita Pizza: Thin crust, with a nice tomato base and topped with basil and cheese. I had more - Chantilly Cake: The cakes at Valentino's are done by Chef Valentino's sister. You can view their side variety of cakes, tarts and desserts at the chiller counter and take your pick! We had Chantilly Cake. The sponge cake and cream were light and together with the white chocolate toppings, it was the perfect compliment to the whole meal.I would recommend you to visit this place for authentic Italian food and also the service staff here will provide you with great service that makes you feel like an old friend

I visited this Ristorante Da Valentino for dinner with my girlfriend. The overall experience was a mixed one. I may consider returning, but not anytime soon.The food was above average but I didn't feel wowed overall. Perhaps I built my expectations too high prior to visiting.- Squid ink linguini. Very good and easily the best dish of the night for me. The texture of the al dente pasta went very well with the squid, which was fresh and crunchy; nicely done. This dish has to be pre-ordered 1 day in advance.- Squid ink fetuccini with crab. Unlike the above dish, the sauce is cream based not squid ink based, so it is orange instead of black. The pasta itself is made with the squid ink. I appreciated the chunky pieces of crab. While this dish was tasty, I felt that the cream slightly overpowered the crab. So after a few bites, I was not able to distinguish between the flavours too well and had to cleanse frequently with wine.- Beef tenderloin carpaccio. Similar level to other carpaccio's i've had. Alright but not noteworthy. - Porcini mushroom soup. Contained a lot of mushrooms, but flavour was too salty for my liking.- A personal gripe, but they do charge for bread. Given that you do pay a 10% service charge and that in most of the Italian, French or Mediterranean restaurants I've been to bread is normally on the house, this came in below my expectations.The restaurant is spacious. Recommended for parties as you can see most tables across the main room. The large space means tables can be lined up, so it is good for families too. The lighting was low and cosy but not to the point of requiring candles. Decor is interesting with many interesting knick-knacks.Service was attentive and good in explaining the menu. I felt the value was below average. We ordered one of the above items plus one glass of Pinot Grigio and it came up to about $70 per person. Do consider also the taxi costs if you don't have a car to get here

We were a party of 10, celebrating a couple of birthdays on a Sunday night. We were in a large, long, narrowish room with 2 other tables. The table next to us was also celebrating a birthday, and probably the other one as well.If you are not familiar with the restaurant, be prepared for sticker shock. When I've been there, the place is usually packed with quite a lot of well-fed families. Lots of photos on the walls of the great and good. It is that sort of place.Having said that, if you know what to order, the food can be good and reasonably priced. If you don't, you could come away feeling less than satisfied. Tip - stick to seafood pasta and pizza. Mains, desserts, coffees and some starters are not such reasonable value. As for wine, do like I did and go for the promo-wine, which was a decent 2005 Aglianico. Extras like bottled water and bread can add up quickly.The bill came to SGD627.22, which is not bad for a good birthday celebration, but this was not our first dinner there and we were careful in our ordering. We could have easily doubled that and left feeling stuffed, instead of nicely satisfied.Service is prompt and friendly. The restaurant is spacious and seating is comfy, unlike some of the Italian restaurants we go to when we just want great food

premise - its at turf city so car park is plenty and free. it's tucked at a corner if you come from the main entrance, else, it has its own entrance at the side. smoking seats are available but no... the view is that of the car parklocation - if you dont drive, it may be a pain via the shuttle bus but other than, it's good and quiet.staff - very (if not overly) attentive but very polite and welcomingfood - not too bad, wanted to try the squid ink pasta but it is a day in advance ordering of that so, remember to call in 1 day in advance. we had the linguine with crab meat and also the beef ravioli. both.... were.... GOOD. the shrooms that came with the ravioli, melted upon biting into. the linguine base was sticky and creamy and slid right down the throat. we also had the buff mozz but the dismal tomatoes that came with were not to expectations, you'd expect buff tomatoes as well to go along well with the mozz but these tomatoes were that which you can buy from any supermarket and at 20+, you'd expect otherwise. other than that, no complains.verdict - GO. it all makes sense, i cant say its the best but one of the best in town
5
Nothing beats a family dinner at this restaurant with a wide variety of dishes to fit the diverse taste buds in my family. I like how the pasta is done, al dente and the sauce is unique and different from everywhere else. Their desserts are to die for including the tiramisu and lava cake. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who like distinct Italian cooking
3
I was expecting the food to be authentic Italian, having just come back from Italy.It was a disappointment. Had the porcini linguine with truffle oil. The pasta was too aldente, almost raw, hard. The smell of the truffle was mild, the taste, hardly there.Very pricey considering the quality of food.Willing to pay for good food, but this does not meet expectations
5
Truly authentic Italian food served by a very attentive crew of service staff. Especially enjoyed the aubergine parmigiana that was the most perfectly cooked version of this Italian classic that ive ever had by far. The interior decor was also really cosy and rustic, and is a nice place for a good Sunday brunch. Will definitely bring the family along the next time i dine here.
4
Great selection of wine - not necessarily the most reasonably priced like most parts of Singapore. Attentive service. Good food.
5
Love the ambience...food was excellent.
Great variety, service staff was prompt and attentive
The t-bone beef was juicy and nice, love the yummy squid ink pasta..
5
After our visit to Italy, we were craving for more Italian again back home. We had the baked eggplant and calamari antipasti, followed by squid ink fettuccine with crab meat and squid ink ravioli. The highlight was the sgroppino which was not in the menu but the staff went all out to make it for us. 5 thumbs up for the service and efforts. If you are visiting Valentino, be sure to ask for the sgroppino.
5
This is the best Italian Restaurant I've dined at. The food was authentic and excellent. Service was outstanding. Valentino & his family do an excellent job. I've never had Osso Bucco done better. Pasta, too.. It could well be the best restaurant I've been to ...period. Nothing really fancy. Just good food and good people. Be sure to stop at Perla's Bake Shop (Valentino's sister). I have not been to their new location, but plan to dine there soon
5
Our singapore friends insisted that we have to come to Valentino and now we know their reason why. It turned out to be a wonderful evening of good food, good wine in a charming Italian restaurant. Its a huge restaurant but decorated like its a cozy Italian home with antique pots, pans and photos of Valentino family. It even has an outdoor section that is also charmingly decorated like a garden. We had the bankette seat which was really intimate and cozy as its an enclosed section but still you get to see the action in the main dining room. An extensive menu with plenty of selection . We had bruschetta, beard, beef carpaccio. We also took the recommendation by the manager for the braised pork papadelle and osso bucco. We also shared the desserts proposed by the manager which were all delicious.What captivated us about the food here is that it has a true home cooked feel and flavorin every dish. A good wine selection too to go with these delicious dishes. I think it will be certainly our turn next time to insist that our friends come here with us 
5
My wife and I were invited by friends who are regular clients of this restaurant. We shared several plates including cheese and tomatoes, anchovies, sea food pasta, pork and spicy chicken. All were excellent and way better than anything I have eaten in an Italian restaurant for several years (even in Italy). The wine was out of this world.I cannot comment on the price as we did not pay.The only negative point is that it was a little noisy
3
It's been a while since we've been , in fact it was at the last place, not here at turf city....but some things haven't changed.The trick is stick to the menu- when the "specials" have such a special price.... I mean $168 ++ for a sea bass! is having a laugh, $200++ for a tbone....come on!We stuck to the menu, had a mid price bottle of wine and got out with just over $300 for two.Service was attentive- to attentive actually - you know when the waiter 'hovers' around constantly pouring the wine... At one point I thought he'd join in the conversation.Food was ok, appetizer was just ok, the pasta course was good but small portions and for main we have filet and veal... Which were both very well cooked and tasty.Overall it was ok, nothing to shout about but not bad. Couldn't remember how many birthdays were going on... It seemed every 5 mins the waiters would surround one table or other... It's a bit like listen ting to one of those stuck records
5
This restaurant succeeds in offering a true Italian experience in every respect -not just excellent food and a fine walk-in wine cellar, but also warm dÃ©cor & lighting, and best of all - an entire Italian family looking after and running this fabulous restaurant. How often have I suffered from ice cold air-conditioning blowing onto my neck and leaving me with cold food - NOT HERE. They spent extra money to vent the cold air into the restaurant without disturbing the patrons. Bravo.There is plenty of parking just outside the restaurant. And albeit not being in downtown Singapore - this restaurant is simply a must visit (you will return, as we did). We can highly restaurant this restaurant and salute the Valentino family
4
I love the Burrata here, and the pasta is deeply satisfying. The margherita pizza is good, but not outstanding. However, the service is the best I have ever come across in Singapore. Waiters at Valentino's are ever-ready to burst into birthday tunes to celebrate a customers' birthday, and their positive attitude makes dining here a real pleasure
3
We ordered burrata , tomato salad and thought the tomatoes were of very good quality and the half creamy burrata too. The use of balsamic vinegar in gelatin capsule is also clever as you don't have the ugly balsamic splashing all over when eating the salad. - nice but u hv to pay $35 Ordered blue cheese pasta , veal marsala and Ravioli.. All Taste delicate and we like them - all pastas. averages $ 30 something too . Dessert -average $15 for a dessert which taste normal. .. Tiramisu ok.. Nice but not sure if worth that much,, will definitely skip dessert next time.Honestly, the ingredients they use seemed to be better than average Italian restuarants. Overall think the food is good and really authentic , just that the prices are really high and make u think if it is worth it... Well, guess if i miss Italian , I may just pop over for an appetizer and a regular pasta and save up on all the rest ; drinks, desserts and even coffee , to cut cost for some good Italian food.Spent sgd. 190 lunch on half - buratta salad, 1 blue cheese spaghetti , I ravioli , 1 Marsala veal escalope , 1 tiramisu., 1 bottle San pellegrino.Pricey for lunch indeed.

Friendly restaurant with a family feel! We couldn't find the restaurant, called and someone picked us up from where we were and she spoke singlish!
Great food, good variety, lovely ambience. The staff are very helpful and pleasant. Made New Year's Eve special!
5
beautiful italian restaurant tucked away on turf club road, away from city. is better you have your own transport, but is worth every second of it...go...try it...i will definitely go back again.
5
I've been going to Valentinos for years now. It is without a doubt my favourite restaurant ever. The service is exceptional, everyone is very friendly, welcoming, and speaks with a great italian accent :-)Lovely atmosphere and table setting. Nice and intimate. Food is amazing! Especially the lobster linguini, and the best Pizza in the world. You cant go wrong with any of their food. And they also have a great selection of wines.Definitely a must. Enjoy!

Where do I begin? Acknowledging the comment that the prices are over the hill and overpriced? The service by a local imitation of the Godfather? The “mise en place” by Ikea China, Ikea cutlery, Ikea wine glass and my torn napkin? The quality and taste of the food? The bill?My Italian reference is the mother of my friend Memo who prepared an excellent meal whenever we came home at whatever time, Italian food as the defacto kitchen in Switzerland or our regular trips to Italy. She taught me that a good Italian chef could be measured by his pesto and his pasta aglio, olio y pepperoncini. I remembered this advise from “Mamma Rosa” until this very day.My daughter (secondo piatto as vegetarian) and I ordered the pasta and my son the pesto (primo piatto) with penne. My daughter, wife and daughter in law ordered an antipasta and I requested to share the AO&P pasta with my wife (I assumed it was a normal portion). The pasta was served with the antipasta that I refused and send it back. I ordered a second ciabatta (saucer size @ S$ 6,50) to go with the antipasta. The waiter brought us a bowl of chopped chili (?!). Maybe “ciabatta” means chili in Godfather Italian. He assured us to come back with the ciabatta. A waitress came with 3 buns (!), e.g. the ciabatta was no more available. 5 minutes later the waiter came by, shocked by the sight of the buns and went away to get us the ciabatta (!?). Mind you we were only at the 1st course at this stage. We already had the “urgent” advise of the sommelier (?) that we should order a red wine following the bottle of Prosecco (?!). The sommelier did not attend our table anymore after I declined his assistance at that stage. His local assistant took our order (Il Grigio) and returned with the statement that the last bottle was sold before and please select an other. I should add that we drive from Switzerland to Castello Banfi to pickup the reservas and buy the certificates for the reservas in 5 year time and hang around in Montalcino or Montipulciano. We are familiar with Italian wines. Anyhow, Valentino even honored us with a visit to mention that we could select any wine from the cave.The primi’s were served and it turned out that the pasta I wanted to share with my wife was less than half a normal portion at S$20,90. I guessed approx. 100 grams of pasta. It was overloaded with fried garlic (approx. 12 gloves). Not Mamma’s pasta. My son’s penne y pesto was “cheesy”. The main course was a Filette de Manzo with Porcini sauce, 2 Saltimbocci, again the pasta and I had a Scalopini Marsala. When I ordered my veal I asked the waiter to add some vegetables because I do not eat potatoes, which was the standard side. I received my veal with unseasoned lettuce and my wife and son had their veal with potatoes and steamed vegetables complimentary from the house. At that time I was already fed up with the whole charade. My daughter in law had to cut her steak with a normal knife and the waiter was surprised when we asked for a steak knife. My Marsala sauce was sour (quality of Marsala?), the Manzo was medium/rare and not medium. The Saltimbocci were OK, but the Brussel’s sprout is not a vegetable served with the delicate taste of a Saltimbocca, e.g. veal, parma and sage in a buttery sauce. Too dominating taste and odor.We ordered some desert and coffee and were informed that the kitchen closes at 22 hrs. The highlight of the evening was the cake for my wife with one candle and the birthday song of the waiters. In short it was a bad “Commedia dell’Arte” with mediocre food, small servings, very bad service at S$836,73 or close to S$167 per cover. I leave it up to the reader whether to make a reservation at this restaurant. I advised my son and his local friends and colleagues to strike this restaurant indefinitely from their short list. Overpriced, overrated and a disgrace to serve the food with these prices on Ikea china, Ikea cutlery and Ikea wine glasses. Sorry Ikea! Advise to Valentino; if you ever visit the “old” country, try to eat at Lorenzo in Forte del Marmi to know how to serve food that justify a price ticket you charge. If you ever visit Switzerland, try to eat at Adelboden in Steinen (SZ) and taste the food of Franz Wiget to justify the price ticket you charge. These chefs I pay the price without any remorse. At Da Valentino I still feel ripped off even after one day
4
The pros: the maître d' was exceptional, the service was fantastic, the food was great - especially loved the special we ordered, the duck casserole, but every dish we got was fresh food seasoned beautifully with a lot of herbs. I love the rustic European old brick feel of the place (you should see the women's bathroom - even though it is really uncomfortably hot in there, it's really a wow moment when you open the door) and the decor which has been Christmased up really added to a festive mood without obnoxious Christmas songs blaring in the background. It's a spacious restaurant which is a great improvement compared to its old location. The cons: The location is not very convenient if you don't drive (but then if you drive, how do you enjoy the wines? So the only option is taxi). It is expensive, though the food was very good. The desserts in particular were considerably more expensive compared to the items on the main menu. The pasta portions could be bigger and some parts of the duck were on the dry side. But the cons definitely feel much more nitpicky than the pros. I would come back again if my wallet allows it and would definitely take friends, family and business associates along to enjoy Valentino.

I came here last night with my family . The restaurant is big and the decoration is nice . Cooking is nothing but ordinary . Service is better than average but meal price is way too pricy . S$36 for a small dish of grilled octopus . S$21 for grilled veggie...etc. they are way too expensive for a family restaurant . Failed to see the value in this restaurant . Definitely will not go back .
5
Never will I miss the opportunity to dine in this fine restaurant every time I come to Singapore. This is the favorite restaurant of a dear friend and has also become my favorite. Everything here is excellent, the food (fish, steak, pork, salad and appetizers ) they are all done by Chef Valentino who comes out from the kitchen to greet the customers. This restaurant is run by an Italian Family who are all gracious and very good looking people! The wine selection is excellent. They recommend the best ones and you can just agree with their choices. It is situated in a place that is not frequented but I am amazed every time I come that it is always full packed! Bravo to their authentic Italian meals
5
We have never had an evening meal at Valentino's always lunch and that was when it was in its old location. The new restaurant is so much bigger, decor is quite dated but the service and the food are quite outstanding we had yet another outstanding meal and a very enjoyable evening
1
I went there couple of days back I think the meal is way overly price for a steak of beef with not even a good piece of meat presented and it is their special for the day. I think they should not boast about who came to their restaurant and showing who they have served but more on their food and really to come here and spend what we consumer wants and deserve. I wish the owner should look into their quality of food and maybe look into their pricing for example a piece of chocolate cake cost $20?? Does it make any sense? If it is a world known pastry chef I do not mind but I should not say much if anyone can afford go to better known restaurant or 5* michelin. Service wise is given as this is a service industry thus I won't say much. If anyone goes to a restaurant all service I must say is decent. How well can you expect??? Anyway if you are the type follow who been to the restaurant and want to be there and you can visit but I think once is really good enulf. Good bye Valentino. Hope you have a well and faithful loyal clients to hold on with.

This restaurant has moved to larger premises and is not as homey as it used to. However, the quality of the food and service is still excellent.The calamari is still superb. It is very tender and the batter is very light. The lasagna is superb. The porcini mushroom is fantasticWe tried the white truffle ice cream. They blended the white truffle with the gelato and the truffle fragrance is very strong. if you want some more white truffles, you can ask them to shave some on the ice cream. The extra topping is sold by the gram. to.

The food here is great and the service is personable and friendly. A diverse menu is available of Italian fare that is presented in an attractive way in proportions that are filling.
4
Went there on a sat afternoon. Very rustic decor n food was marvelous. The waiters know their food n the burrata cheese is just out of this world! Prices are a little steep but worthed every penny…
4
Restaurant is helmed by Chef Valentino and his family. Beautiful setting and even the ladies powder room is special. They have a good selection with a wide range of good wine. Food is good: Parma ham, stewed octopus, tomatoes, Squid ink pasta which need to be pre-ordered now, beef and desserts. 5 of us were here for a business dinner. Total cost is $900 together with a bottle of Amarone wine
4
Went to the restaurant based on the terrific reviews from Sg bloggers. Although hard to find, & the ambience is very dated, the food was great. My squid ink pasta with crab was delicious, crab juicy, fresh & sweet. Even my picky mother was happy with her tenderloin & foie gras. Service was exceptional, very attentive & considerate. Getting there is tricky, though. Better to come with car than taxi
5
Heard of this wonderful place and decided to try it out for myself, and I was impressed.Recommended that you reserve ahead to avoid disappointment.The restaurant was easily located if you travel by vehicle and the valet waits right in front of it. Stepping into the premises, I was drawn to the heavily decorated walls and fittings. A really beautiful place exuding a nice and cosy feel, along with that little waiting area at the reception.The food was real good, and definitely stands among one of the best I had. There is an alfresco area outside, which felt really country style.Service was impeccable, and even when the restaurant gets filled, the servers are still as observant and ready to serve as though you were the only one there.I'm ready to be back anytime
5
We started off with the Burata cheese, stuffed whole squid and stuffed vegetables. They were perfect. Had the porcini mushroom pasta as a 1st course. The grand finale was the 1kg Steak Florentine. It was really good and the beef melts in your mouth. This 90 day aged strip lion was wonderful. Service staff were great as usual.

I went with my family for dinner to celebrate my birthday. Being from Chicago I've had my fair share of great Italian food and though I would say that I've had better Italian food this place was very good, certainly within the category of what I consider the best in Singapore. I would characterize the food has not being full of surprises or things that really wow you but just very tasty, well prepared, food with quality ingredients. I had a steak (I'm not really a steak guy), one of my kids had the lasagna, the other had pizza, and wife had ravioli. For dessert my daughter had chocolate lava cake. I tried everything and really liked every dish. The wine list was quite extensive and we managed to select a very enjoyable Valpolicella. The best part of the whole experience however was the service, it was fantastic. We felt like we were getting the kind of good service you can get back home and in fact we tipped out waiter 20%, the first time I have ever tipped a waiter in Singapore. Is it pricey? Well, it's all about value isn't it. What isn't pricey in Singapore? Hawker food is great and I eat it several times a week for lunch, but for a nice sit down down, I feel like you are really getting what you pay for at Valentino
4
One of the best services we have seen in Singapore. Food was very good, i specially liked the bruschetta and tartufo chocolato for dessert. The only watchout is for the specials, we ordered one and were surprise when the bill came and we saw the cost was approx over 3 times more expensive than the most expensivie item in the menu, what doesn't seem right... It was a fish with a very small portion of salad, the fish was very good, but honestly really not worth what it costed, if it was half of what it was, it would still have been overpriced. Would i go back? For sure, the restaurant, service and food are good, but will not be fooled again with the specials
4
Loved the Italian food and experienced the best service in the city. We had Bruschetta, Pasta Carbonara, Sole fish, and Tartuffo Chocolate for desert. The Limoncello that came at the end was a nice touch. Just watch out for the daily recommendations, they are great but the prices are 2-3x higher than the average menu item, better to ask before ordering because the waiter will not inform upfront
2
My first visit to this restaurant. Good decor. The food was average, normal, nothing spectacular. The waiter was trying to push us to order so many dishes it felt annoying. Every dish seemed to be a special. The wines were totally over priced and exhorbitant. When the bill came, it felt unreal, totally exhorbitant. We were a group of 4 and for the amount we paid, it was not worth it. Extremely expensive. The waiter didn't mention the ridiculous prices attached to the specials or those dishes he recommended. There are many many better Italian restaurants in Singapore. Total rip off to say the least
2
S$300 for lunch for two adults and a child, 2 appetizers, 3 mains, 4 glasses of house white and a bottle of water. Very average food.....Les Amis is cheaper!!
3
We went as a group of five to this restaurant in Turf city. The food and service was good but beware of accepting the waiter’s specials without enquiring the price. The waiter recommended the sea bass for two but did not explain that it was $180 dollars! I would return again but check the price of the specials

I am a loyal customer of Valentino. I found this restaurant to be authentic Italian with excellent home-style food, superb service, and down-to-earth cozy ambiance. On a recent visit however, I discovered that they have moved from Jalan Bingka Bukit Timah to Turf City. It’s now much(!) bigger with much more open space, fine-dining-like ambiance. Naturally, I was a bit apprehensive about this new place wondering if it would still be as good as it once was. In fact, I was actually a bit disappointed that the warm, intimate, comfy place I was familiar with had to move up the scale like this. As I was standing there at the reception, gawking at the new look of the restaurant (which is actually nice but upscale and expansive), I saw the friendly and helpful waiter I knew from the old place. He assured me that this place is still as good or even better. Even though he wasn’t actually the waiter at my table, he and the actual waiter ended up attending us!My friend and I (just the 2 of us) ordered food that would have been more befitting to feed a large Italian family (we love to eat!). Two starter dishes of premium Prosciutto di Parma combined with antipasto of creamy and fresh burrata, sweet and ripe cherry tomatoes, pellets of vinaigrette and greens. Primi Piatti of fresh lobster linguini aglio olio. Main Course of succulent bone-in prime rib roast, and Branzino Italian seabass. Complimentary was warm homemade bread served with pesto oil. For the wine, my friend had a glass of Moscato and I had the Falanghina semi-dry white wine. The bread, wine and food were all of superb quality and taste… except for the Branzino. The fish was not fresh, so it had a real earthy taste. This was a huge disappointment because I never ever had mediocre food at any of my previous visits over the years to Valentino.Overall however, we enjoyed our dinner and the overall experience. It’s very pricey, which is expected so we don’t even look at the prices when we ordered. It’s one of those “let’s just splurge and enjoy” moments! Still… when the bill came we were quite surprised how expensive it actually was (my friend picked up the bill to celebrate her birthday, which made me writing this review the more enjoyable). I can still say however that considering there are so many new and trendy restaurants in Singapore, Ristorante da Valentino is still the one I would go back to again and again whenever I visit Singapore

This authentic italian has been in Singapore for many years and well loved by locals and expats all the same. Recently moved to a new location at Turf City with bigger space to accommodate expanding customers base. A mixture of high profile customers from Ministers to celebrities and regular families and couples. The new location / restaurant has a vibrant atmosphere, reminds me a little of Viva Italia! The owner himself together with his family runs this place like it used to when they first started. Always friendly and helpful, loved the service and of course... the great iItalian food. Simple yet delicious with multiple courses if you have the appetite to savour them all.We just went for the usual and simpliest pasta and pizza with starter of mozzarella wtih tomato. Oh the home made focaccia bread... crisp crust that is soft and warm inside... yum! They also serve Italian labelled beverages like wine, beer, fizzy drinks and my favourite Moscato by the glass. The food and service at Valentino never disappoint. For those who have not tried, do pay a visit there soon and decide for yourself how 'delicioso' the food is

I had a seafood pasta which is off the menu and it cost $42.9, for 2 clams, 2 prawns, 2 mussels, alot of squids and some imported cherries. Worst part is it tasted so bad I had to ask for tobasco sauce to make it better. The ambience is bad, more like a casual American Italian diner and I certainly find that it has no right to charge so exhorbitant for such a below average dish. I will never ever go there again and will advise anyone from going there... there are much better Italian restaurants in Singapore and service was just mediorcre

We were there to celebrate our daughter's birthday. They gave us a nice booth seat that looked over the restaurant. The service was good and they made effort to make our toddler daughter feel special on her birthday. The service staff knows their products and were able to provide recommendations and upsell the Specials of the Day. Food wise we loved it and definitely no complaints. Great choice of wine and beverages. Would definitely come back here for the food. The prices are a little steep but it's a great place for that special occassion. The family that owns the restaurant are warm and hospitable and made guests feel welcomed. It was a little hard to find them at The Grandstand as they are hidden away in one corner of the building

Enjoyed Sunday lunch here with a couple of friends recently.They have most Italian classics; such as pastas, pizzas and risottos, as well as more elaborate mains based on meats and fish. We had a combination of salads and pasta dishes and we were all happy with our choices. The caprese salad was really good, but the portions were small.Nevertheless, the location of the restaurant is peculiar; in the lower level of the grandstand of a disused horse racing track (Turf City); a good 20 minutes in taxi from the Central Business District of Singapore. This makes it very difficult to organize business lunches with clients.Another issue is the pricing: admittedly, Western food is very expensive in Singapore, but we think that Da Valentino is overcharging, considering they are not located in prime real estate and that the quality of the food is good, but not memorable. This detracts of the whole experience

Valentino's came highly recommended by a friend, has a good reputation among my colleagues, so we gave it a try. While there was nothing wrong with anything, there was nothing special either. The location is far from the city, the restaurant is in a strange location in the Turf city mall, taxi dropped us at the mall entrance so we wandered about 20 minutes trying to find the restaurant, which is only accessible from outside. The decor was nice, but not intimate. Service was prompt, too prompt. It felt like we were being rushed through the meal at every stage. Cordial, but too efficient. The food was good, buratta, filet and prawns, but not outstanding. Price did meet our expectations, which was expensive. All in all, there are much better options at this price that are tastier, more relaxing and more convenient to the city (where most travelers will be) for Italian cuisine
4
The service was attentive. Recommendations by the waiter were very forthcoming, possibly too much so, making it feel sometimes like they had a hidden agenda. The food it's as always good to very good. Unusual, tasty & sometimes surprising. No complaints here, you'll have a good meal.Ambience was good. The new location is big & spacious. Somewhat hard to find the first time as it's off the beaten path from the main Turf City building. But easy once you know where it is, with adequate car parking.Cost of the meals are generally on the high side, so for most, affordability is an issue & it will probably be just a place to go for celebrations or when you just wasn't to spoil yourself

Been here about 4x in the last 2 years, venue has moved and I noticed the quality dropped slightly (or my expectations continued to be high) however it remains among the better Italian place in town. The price, undoubtedly, is on the upper end however the taste has so far delivered and none of friends / family who ate there have complained so far. Worth a shot

We had dinner at this nice place in a warm Italian atmosphere. Best beef, very fresh and good quality Mediterranean sea bass, tasty chicken soup , tender pork ! I would recommend u to have a try.. They also serve nice wine, Gaja, for example.
5
This restaurant provides homely Italian cuisine in an excellent ambience. The restaurant moves from its former location at Rifle Range road to the Turf city recently but it as not lost its charm and hospitality.
3
Being a bit out of town and since they have changed from 6 avenue to turf city i expected more from the new valentino's. restaurant is much bigger, food and service still ok, but nothing exiting.Order from the a la carte as the specials are very pricey!! maybe evening is nicer but after this experience i want try it again

Do not take the waiters recommendation for wine without asking the price at the Turf City restaurant - it seems they will recommend you the most expensive by the glass or very expensive by the bottle. This has been my experience and the experience of another customer who had an unpleasant argument with the owner about it. Good restaurants would never try and fleece their customers like this and in my experience would always offer a mid-range recommendation. It's my feeling that the waiters have been briefed to do this - perhaps the restaurant needs to recoup some costs of opening a second establishment? Not very honest and really off-putting.
5
The restaurant is in the turf city complex, which is still developing, but definitely worth a visit. The atmosphere was perfect and very authentic and we were made to feel very welcome on arrival. Our waiter really knew the dishes, not only on the menu, but also the specials, so much so most of our choices were the specials. The pasta course was the perfect size to sample the tastes of Italy with a little asian influence, but my beef with a cheese sauce was amazing and is making my mouth water as I write this and remember the taste. Please, please, please do visit this restaurant, but not the nights when I want to make a reservation. Great job guys

Our Singaporean friend took us to dinner here, and we loved it. It is run by a fun, loving Italian family. The atmosphere is cozy and welcoming, and the food and wine menus are to die for. The chef himself guided our selections. We started with burrata, sweet tomatoes, and prosciutto, which was such a great way to go! The salted focaccia the restaurant provides was a perfect pair with the starters, and the red wine we had went beautifully as well. For our pasta course, we did the mushroom ravioli...yum! And our main was an enormous but perfectly cooked t-bone that we three shared. It came with sides of potato and green salad. We all were too busy enjoying to talk much on that course! And to finish, we shared a panna cota and tiramisu. All was so delicious and lovingly served...we finished with a toast of limoncello

Looked forward to this very authentic Italian Restaurant and matching ambience. We stood in front of a shut down Restaurant (they did not mention to us when we booked and confirmed booking (!) that they had moved. With overseas guests accompanying us and raving about this charming place, it was a bit unnerving. We finally found the new location and boy, were we in for a surprise. The place (Restaurant) swapped not only its location but also image and charm! Now located in a large hall setting the Restaurant lost its ambience and created a new image. The Restaurant was not full (Saturday night - surprising after this "artificial" haggeling for a table), yet noisy due to the type of setting, service staff which appeared lost (we had to ask 3 times for bread to accompany the entrees), clinical hello by the Patron. The food was excellent. The entry now boasts a "commercial shopping corner" of glas ware. In summary, now one of many larger restaurant settings in Singapore offering very good foood. Not worth it though anymore to go for this very special atmosphere reflecting "Italy at its best"

Valentino is 1 of my favourite italian restaurants in Singapore. The reasons are simple, good food, cosy, tastes like home, great service. This place will leave you wanting more. Food is excellent and very homely. Ask if Mum Perla has any specials for the day as she usually makes special dishes depending on what fresh ingredients she can garner from the markets. Service is wonderful. This is a restaurant that will make you return

This restaurant was hard to find via taxi, and is located next to nowhere in a non-descript mall, but once inside, you feel that you are in a warm traditional Italian restaurant. The service was prompt and polite. The menu is vast, with a great selection of pastas and meat/fish dishes. I recommend the beef ravioli and the sicilian fish. The flavours were delicious, authentic, and the portions were just right. The prices are a tad on the pricier side, but that is to be expected in Singapore, unless you are at a food center or hawker center, which this is not. The only thing I will comment negatively about is the portion of their wine pour. You can choose (though our waiter did not tell us this) amongst 3 sizes in milliliters for 3 prices. The wines by the glass are stored in a machine which pours out precisely down the last ML how much wine you should get. Our "medium" size choice, poured into a huge glass, which made it look like several tablespoons of wine, made for a strange feeling of stinginess amidst fine dining and environment. A rather out-of-place policy.Overall, a great restaurant though, and we will be back

I love this restaurant. Ambiance, owner with staff and food are very very good! Food is consistent! This is a restaurant ran by an Italian Family.. Valentino, owner and chef with his sister, Perla, husband, papa and mama are ever present to extend personal service to every guests. Love their fresh mozzarella with tomatoes, the calamari, black ink pasta with crab meat. Their fish are all fresh.. I come to Singapore about 5 times a year and I never miss to go to this Italian Restaurant
5
Whilst Valentino has often polarised opinion, there can be little doubt that his cooking is superb. With the new location at Turf City the restaurant also offers more variety in terms of the dining experience even if it feels a shame to have left the old venue which had so much character.The family and staff remain as charming as ever and with the prices now much more 'under control' it is a truly great dining experience. The grilled octopus starter and the home style chicken pot are highly recommended and Valentino probably cooks the best fish of any of the Italian chefs in Singapore. Valentinos is truly excellent nowadays

Had been to Valentinos twice previously almost a year back and the food was good then. But we just had dinner there and 3 out of 4 dishes that we ordered were way too salty though we're definitely not the bland-loving, saltless type. We ordered the mixed mushrooms fried with butter for our started and that was the 1st of the salty dishes to come. Had to eat lots of bread to finish the dish. We gave feedback to the waiter on this 1st dish too. Then, came the quatro staggioni pizza which was good - nice crust and yummy overall.But the next 2 main dishes, seafood risotto and squid ink pasta not only took >20 mins to be served but were so salty that we had to keep drinking water to compensate. Since the mains took so long, i didn't want to ask for them to change as we were told that the table had another reservation waiting, so hubby and I had the most horrendously salty meal ever. The waiter did say that they would've changed it for us, but well, if it meant another 20 min wait, then we'd probably just swallow all the food and probably never want to go back again. Lovely family ambience and it's a pity the food was just too salty
4
I echo most of the other reviews concerning price and quality..... But I would note that price comparisons with London, Tokyo, New York etc. might make it seem more reasonable. Only in Singapore where great hawker food costs $3 does it seem absurdly priced.They have also moved to new premises in Turf City. Better and bigger inside but slightly off the beaten track for a top class restaurant
5
Ristorante Da Valentino is one of my all time favorite restaurants. I just went back after not being there for quite some time and again it's food and atmosphere are superb.Valentino's is the best place to go if you want to have a homestyle Italian meal with some of the best ingredients and best service in Singapore. The whole premise of the restaurant is great as well. The mom makes the sauce, the brother-in-law is the head waitre, the father greets you at the door. You just can't go wrong with this restaurant.The pricing is reasonable but it's still Singapore so it can be fairly expensive if you have a big meal. Also reservations are a must, this place only has about 10 tables and packs up fast.I would recommend going on a Friday or Saturday when they usually have fresh burrata cheese as well as usually some of 'Mama's Chicken'
5
Valentino is a really authentic home cooked italian restaurant run by a super enthusiastic Italian family. Everything is home made/baked and you can really taste the difference. Their buffalo mozzarella is the best I have ever tasted - not to mention the home made pastas and fab wine selection. Book early - even on a Sunday this place gets busy!
5
Been a few times. Great family place. Very friendly staff who deliver wonderful service. The maitre d' dances through the menu like he's in an opera, and I love the wine area where you can choose your bottle it's engaging without being overwhelming like a full cellar. Go there
5
We loved this little restaurant.Felt just like we were in Italy again. It's rustic, homely with a bit of kitch on the side.Service was superb, food fabulous and italian wines, great.Not cheap by any stretch of the imagination, but we felt that we got value for money and enjoyed the whole experience.Menu stand outs for us were the the 3 month air dried beef - pretali de bresaola, in the antipasti section, linguini carbonara and linguini aglio olio peperoncino in the pasta section, and the veal with parma ham in sage sauce - salti in bocca alla romana in the mains section. Limoncello and espresso finished off a wonderful meal.We will be back
4
This was my second visit to this restaurant and it has taken over a store a few shops down. I dined at this new extension last night. It was late and my table was the only one. We ordered the calamari and the sardines and they were excellent. We had the pizza with an egg on top. I suggest skipping the extra egg and sticking to the traditional toppings. The pasta was excellent and the grilled sea bass was fantastic. I will go back to this restaurant again next time I visit Singapore.
4
Brilliant home cooking in a restaurant that is refreshingly un-trendy. Service is great and we generally just go with what the waiter recommends - in 7 or 8 visits he has never let us down. BUT, be warned if you start with some bubbles, move on to a decent white and finish with a big red or desert wine you may find the bill makes your eyes roll
5
Tucked away in an unlikely spot with little parking, this wonderful gem is exceptional. It is small and quaint, but the food it very good. We each had something different, and all entrees were delicious. We didn't get dessert as we were so full. As with many Singapore restaurants, the price is quite high, but well worth the visit

Very good Italian food but the prices are ridiculous.
For those prices, you could eat in a fine-dining restuarant.
There are a few other Italian restuarants that are just as good but cheaper.
Very crowded. Booking is essential.

I went there and one of the waiters spat on the floor beside me !!!
I found 3 hairs in my pasta aswell !!
He then swore in Italian at me but I speak fluent Italian !

Please if you do not listen to my review and still you decide to try, DO NOT ORDER the "specials of the day". They will charge you just double for a very plain and simple dish. I am not an awesome cook and I can say some of the dishes were better and tastier at my place than at Valentino's. We payed $SGD25+++ for some cherry tomatoes that we did not even order (and naively accepted from the suggestion of the manager). The dessert trolley is awful, so rundown and dirty that you cannot see inside. Anyway skip the desserts because they not only have a not yummy taste, indeed when you try them they are even worse.Sorry to have written so many negative points, but I just want to help people like me that thought they were going to a fine- nice- dining restaurant and was awfully surprised from a rundown- atmosphere, decoration and simple simple food at a super expensive price. NOT worthy at all
5
We tried two of the day's specials - the Buffalo mozzarella and prawn fettucine, and were not disappointed. The mozzarella was served with a bowl of juicy tomatoes and a bit of salad. It was absolutely devine.I'm not usually a fan of cream sauce pastas but the prawn fettucine was an exception. We also ordered the porcini risotto, which is so far the best risotto I've had in Singapore.The crab pizza had a nice thin crust but seemed normal next to the other dishes we had. Or maybe it was because it was slightly cold by the time we got to it. Dessert was also a a memorable experience. Thumbs up to the cream caramel and fig tart. It was so good we bought extras to take home.A definite must try
5
My husband and I were first introduced to Valentino's a few months ago by some friends who have been dining there for six years. We have returned several times, including earlier this month to celebrate my birthday. For our first experience, we ordered practically everything on the menu and we were never disappointed. The taste of the beef tenderloin, hot that evening and cold from the fridge the next day, will never leave my mind. It was the best thing I have ever eaten.Being an American expat, I believe the prices are average for a typical Singaporean restaurant. There are a lot of places we could go and spend a lot more but the food would not be as good. We have never had a poor experience. The family that runs the restaurant (family tree on the menu) is what makes the atmosphere so special
3
We live in Singapore and have been to Valentino a few times. The restaurant is charming in a run down sort of way; it could use some renovation. Some of the menu items are among the best Italian I have ever had. Excellent choices are squid ink pasta and the twisted mozzarella.However the prices are completely out of control, even for Singapore where most food tends to the expensive side. $6 for a soda?! Over $20 for a simple salad (I can't believe they ship lettuce from Italy). Anyway, the business model seems to be working, because even though the costs are unconscionable the tables are full
4
Valentino and his family welcome you like nowhere else but check your wallet,vthey love that too. Fish and pizzas will delight and the home made desserts will bring a smile too.Go for lunch and stick to white wine, your bank manager will be happier. Specials are expensive, but worth it
5
Small quaint restaurant in a somewhat out of the way place. Family run with great service. Every dish we ordered was excellent. Best meal we have had in Singapore and we live here. You won't find better food outside Italy. Well worth the drive. Be sure to make reservations. Not the cheapest meal on the island but well worth the price
1
Went there, with my husband on our Anniversary. They make it sound like - so difficult to get a booking, so we also got carried away and were absolutely elated to get a booking on our anniversary day. The quaint setting and the first greet was charming, but every thing there on was more than horrible !To cut the long story short, the food was nothing much to talk about. The belini was the worse I have ever had. I clearly stated that I am a vegetarian and still the Salad was brought with Octopus. Instead of replacing it, they merely just removed the octopus. Even without the Octopus, the salad was hopeless. I just merely discussed with my husband, that probably he should not order a Minestrone soup. The waitor I guess was not paying much attention and brought out the Minestrone. Which was worse than Pasta Mania. My Ravioli was plain and nothing special. He made it seem to my husband that a very special pizza is being made to order for him. It was hopeless !..and we came to know only ater why it was recommende - to be able to charge Double !.Food & taste is very personal, so for a moment we can take a step back and say that our taste buds perhaps didnot appreciate the super gourmet food, but then this takes the icing - A totally wrong and heavily jacked up bill.We have travelled and fine dined all over the world. We have done dining at all sorts of places for 25-30 people, but have never come across any mistake in the bill - may be 1 or 2 by mistake.In a simple dinner of 2 people there were 4 additional charges. How can that be 1 It cannot be mere error ! For me 4 mistakes in the bill is definitely an attempt to over charge ! Our bill was jacked up by 25% !!! We usually for dinners like this simply pull out the credit card and donot really check. But then the taste in the mouth was so bad..we just happen to look clearly into the bill.Never go there is all I can sa

I dine at several Michelin restaurants during my numerous trips up Europe and I pride myself to have dined at many great tables in the lovely cities across EuropeThe food at Valentino's is accepatable but to book a table there is close to impossible.They keep on telling you that it is full and you have to book several weeks in advance.I find it easier to book a table at a 3 star Michelin restaurant in Italy.Granted the restaurant is small but so are most restaurants in Europe.And if you do get a table,you will find the wait not worth it.They will usually load you with all the expensive stuff and honestly speaking,the food is not fantastic.As for the service,the last time I was there, they forgot about our takeaway and did not even call us back the next day to remind us!All this does not bode well for a "fine" dining restauran
5
Very cozy italian homes style decor! Loved every minute and the personal service, from the chef grating truffle in flakes on my pasta to the recommendations from the wine list! Super Super 5 star joint, and within reachable money.

Lovely Italian family restaurant in a homely setting in a quiet neighbourhood, but no less popular. Attentive service even with chef owner.

beautiful italian food and lovely deserts

authentic italian food and really yummy pizzas!!
5
Best Italian food I had in Singapore. The squid ink pasta was lovely, the beef steak platter was done nicely and laid out on the greens, simple without the frills but taste really good.
5
One of our family's fave Italian restaurants! Good food, good service and kid friendly!

Very different but great Italian food! Must ry at least once. Parking is a problem sometimes. Just valet it.

After hearing much much good reviews on this restaurant, I thought to give it a go. Decoration in the restaurant was horrendous - it was oozing with cheesiness and I have had my fair share of that in university days! If cheesy decor is your cup of tea, then this is the place but the food was not any better.Looking at the menu, I could feel with a sinking heart that I was not going to eat well. I ordered crabmeat with pasta wtih cream thinking it would just be a dollop of cream but when they said wtih cream, that was exactly what I had - half a carton of cream in my pasta. At least the mozzarella was fresh though that didn't require any culinary skills. My partner had pasta which was overcooked - shame on the chef for people from south of Italy are famous for their seafood pasta.The price for what we had was daylight robbery. I would not recommend this to anyone and eating there is not eating well. You'd best go get yourself fastfood.The hype for this place baffles me. I suspect that it's because there are not many tables so they get booked up easily and all flock to the un-bookable one
5
Now this has to be the #1 restaurant in Singapore. Valentino and Mama do a fantastic italian spread! Service is very warm and friendly. The best thing to do is to go in a bigger group 4 at least, and tell Valentino to decide on the food. It's good to share the starters and main which is what we usually do. Excellent place. Reservations is a MUST. 3 weeks in advance is probably best
5
This is our favorite restaurant in Singapore! We love the quaint ambiance & the family feel. Having traveled in Italy quite a bit, Valentinos makes you feel as if you are there again. Mama Valentino is always cooking up something special for the evening that you know will hit the spot :) If you don't feel like making a decision leave it in the hands of one of the wonderful waitors & you can't go wrong! Buon Appetito
5
Lobster in pink sauce, Florentine beef, steak with mash and porcini, rabbit stew, calamari, trecchia (braided fresh mozarella), "fish soup", tiramisu, zucotto...everything here is good. They insist on using top quality ingredients, and not many restaurants in Singapore have that kind of pride anymore.
4
Simple and satisfying home-cooking. A place to dress down and fill up at.
3
Good food but OVERPRICED!
4
Love! Buffalo mozarella, parma pizza, squid ink pasta, 850g beef - they were all spot on! Ask the chef to recommend a dessert not in the menu...I didn't like what was offered on paper, but licked up everything that the chef made onsite...outstanding.
4
T-bone is excellent
5
Good Food, Excellent Service and Hearty Portions. Always Ask For Recommendations Cos' the Best are Often Off e Menu
5
Yummy food.. nice cosy homey ambience.. the gnocci and cream sauces are a must try
4
I'd give this place 3.5 stars if this TripAdvisor thing allowed because 4 stars is pushing it. Although Valentino's is one of the better Italian joints outside of town, it is let down by small portions and rather high prices. Street Directory's review was skewed
4
The risotto, lovingly stirred over a slow fire by Mama, is to die for
5
The food is amazing, I have never had a bad meal here however this place is not just about the food it is about the dining experience. They do everything they can possibly do to make you feel like you are part of their family. The only comment I would have is that the wine is extremely expensive for what it is but at the same time but its that way everywhere else in Singapore too
