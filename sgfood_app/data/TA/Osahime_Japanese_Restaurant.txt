...and we had a great time. On that day (Sat) they offered a buffet and we ate "good stuff" at a very good quality. Combined with a relatively modest pricing this is a clear recommendation.

Came back here again this week for lunch, and opted for the Chirashi sushi once again. This time I wasn't quite so impressed - everything was pretty average and there didn't seem to be much fish in the Chirashi. Acceptable enough but nothing special.

Chanced upon this for dinner with my wife; just finished eating my Tenzaru soba and hot sake! Total bill after discount is S$27; excellent value for very good food.The place is quiet; we've been the only customers all throughout. Probably because it is in the centre of the financial district and a stone's throw from the many eating places in Clarke Quay; draws the crowd away.Would definitely recommend the place to anyone

Had a business lunch today and was the 1st time at this restaurant. Was half full at peak hour during lunch time as most people look for cheap eats. They have a good selection of sets and bentos to choose from and also a a la carte menu. Food was actually good and so was the service which was very caring and efficient

Came here for lunch today. No trouble getting a table at about 12.30pm on a Monday. Fairly extensive selection of bento boxes. I opted for the Chirashi sushi set which was good but not amazing. Miso soup was very good as were the pickles. We also had a small bottle of sake which was priced quite reasonably at $18++. All up the bill was just over $80 which seems like reasonable value for the area

It is one of those restaurants that I always passed by but never stepped in till tonight, suggested by *Edwin. So, dinner comprised of him, and a long-lost buddy *Chris. While the daytime crowd was overwhelming, the nighttime crowd was pathetic, with barely more than 5 tables occupied at any point in time.The starter was Buta Kakuni (pork belly) â€“ the fatty layers were buoyant in a delicious way, melting readily upon contact with the palate; the flesh was utterly tender in texture. When eaten together, the combination of the two different textures came together in a lovely gastro-symphony that lingered in the mind long after the dish has been devoured.Following that, the Deluxe Sashimi Platter (SGD$100.00) that was being served on a tray shaped like a boat, comprising of salmon sashimi, tuna belly sashimi, shrimp sashimi, swordfish sashimi etc. The sashimi slices were all thick and bouncy, showing off their freshness and relying on their natural freshness for flavor. This was incredibly good, especially the shrimp that dissolved in the mouth seductively.Fish Head came next, a very sizable one at that! As expected, the cheeks area were utterly tender and smooth, sailing through the palate like a dream. The fish was fresh and sweet of fish's natural flavor; the flesh was abundant amidst the large pieces of bones which was rather surprising.For full review and more detailed information, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2015/04/dinner-at-osahime-sushi-bar-restaurant.htm
