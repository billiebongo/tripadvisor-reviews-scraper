I ate lunch here. The kimchi chigae was passable. The side dish of kimchi was awful. Soft, sour, and clearly way too ripe. Very disappointed.

I really love how the owner and chefs serve us with heart and entertainment! Lovely lovely service! The fried chickens are to die for! (remember to pair them up with the grapefruit Soju!) Not forgetting their soups & pancakes! (i love the seafood pancake!). Amazing BBQ meat! Very generous portion and deliciously tasted! Would definitely recommend to my friends and go back for more

HAPPY TGIF!!! What makes Friday even better? KOREAN FOOD! Kimchi Pancake, Bean Paste Seafood Stew, Spicy Seafood Tofu Stew, King Egg Roll, Korean BBQ and more. Have you spotted your favourite dish? My favourite dish would be the Signature Seafood and Bean Paste Broth. Layering flavours with clams, squid, vegetables to create a rich and fragrant seafood and bean paste broth that makes you crave for more

we had a wonderful sizzling time eating grill bbq meats like pork belly, pork collar Pork Jowl. The food was all very tasty and their service was awesome! They even serve different cocktail soju with latest KPOP music where you can drink it up with all you friends. I like their alacarte dish, Seafood Tofu Stew known as Haemul Sundubu Jjigae that reminds of my times in Seoul, korea. It is very comforting to eat, and there's a bubbling of flavorful broth filled with seafood and toufu

Love the huge selection of food available at Han Pan Korean Restaurant with a lot of choices for stews, appetisers and food for sharing. The fluffy King Egg Roll was my favourite as it was so soft, airy and light in texture. Most Korean restaurants I have been to are quite standardised in their kind of food served but Han Pan has it slightly different. The grilled meats were nice and I like that the slices were thick enough to hold the juices in

This is a place with nice hospitality and staff, and more importantly, good authentic Korean food. Weekdays are packed with office hour crowd and is a popular choice among Koreans. Favourite has to be their spicy chicken bulgogi, bbq meats, and their appetising stew (love both the bean paste seafood and spicy Korean seafood stew)

I could tell the food had some effort in their preparation and waiting time was commendable. However, I am appalled by the poor service or rather lack of service from the staff. When asked if they offer refill of their side dishes, the staff replied that they do while another staff nearby decided to reply me as well and placed 3 plates of side dish he took from the table behind us and said that he could give me 10 plates of this (in sarcasm). I'm usually not one to fuss about service but I feel upset for the Korean Chef whose effort in the dishes are not put to justice by the poor service. We also enquired about the fried Chicken which was displayed on their poster, the same rude staff asked if we wanted to order and when we enquired about the price he said "it's on the menu" in a condescending attitude. When we took the time to explain and point out that it wasn't stated in their menu he looked sheepish for a moment but still nonetheless very fast to defend that it's in their system. I could go on and give more examples about their service, clearly they need time to reflect.

LocationLocated at boat quay near the central business district of singapore, the restaurant is accessible via the Raffles MRT. If you are driving, be sure to use the valet service. Carpark is usually full and you may have to wait 15-20mins before a space becomes available.PlaceThe restaurant looks and feels like the ones I visited in Seoul. You will feel welcomed here. The place is usually crowded on the weekends, so a phone reservation is recommended. Lunch is crowded, so my colleagues and I usually visit the place at 11.30am for an early lunch.FoodIf you are looking for authentic Korean Food near Shenton Way, this is the place to try. If its your first time at Hanpan, be sure to try out the pork belly, yangnyeom fried chicken and kimchi pancake.The grilling of the pork belly takes about 10mins. If you are very hungry, complimentary side dishes are provided. I like to wrap a slice of pork belly, kimchi, garlic and bean paste sauce with a lettuce and have it in a mouthful. Full satisfaction there! Goes very well with some ice cold beer. The kimchi pancake is excellent, very tasty and done to perfection.Rating4.5/5 stars. Will definitely visit Hanpan again.

Hanpan, as the staff explained, means Korean Meal, or Korean Rice - which is a must have for all Koreans during meal time.I was rather surprised at the fact that they even have those big drawstring bags to keep your bags and coats like the places in Korea. Certainly a plus point so that my cubicle won't smell of kimchi the next day in the office.The pork and beef were sliced to perfection for us to barbecue. What's more when we were about to meddle with the food, the staff came over to help with the cooking. And all we had to do the entire night - sit and eat. :D Absolutely a treat.That is also the moment when we found out that: barbecued kimchi + pork belly + sochu + beer = is actually a very very nice combo!! (hic)The only setback is probably the carparking, if you drive. As the usual carparking problem in boat quay area goes, there is also a valet service right outside the restaurant to solve your night's problem for $10.The night went absolutely crazy with too much beers and jokes from the boss and we even braved up to have a taste of the Korean silk worms. Definitely a fear factor challenge to us before we savour on them, but after that it's just like popping peanuts with the beer.Han Pan, A-star. Will definitely be back

In Summary - Great value, taste and ambienceAmbience – It has a slightly old school korean vibe going on, slightly dark and danky but it’s a great example of how two wrongs can make a right. Though the server was Filipino, the chefs were korean and I could hear them talking back and forth, that was a pretty good sign to me as nobody will know korean food better than the Koreans in my opinion. 4/5Quality – First off, the portions were amazing. For less than $10, I was given two grilled plates full of meat, and that was a BIG PLUS to me. We ordered the Beef & Pork bulgogi and an accompanying spicy soup, and all three were in a great portion for me. They were generous and gave a few dishes of the typical side dish, not vegetables but actual meat dishes as well. That’s very rare. 5/5Service – Because there was a full house for lunch, and they had 1 server +1 manager, understandably it will cause a bit of a back log so service was reasonably slow, but it gave me time to chit chat with my colleague and gossip about other people. But I was served with a smile and that was more than enough for me. 4/5Value – Because of the numerous side dishes, big bowl of rice and the grill full of meat, I’ll give this place a 5 star for value. I’m usually quite a pain in the S for places that are expensive, but I think this is a genuinely affordable korean restaurant. Judging that most kopitiam serves crap korean food made by non-koreans and charge you $8, $9.9 for what I had in a decent restaurant is amazing. 5/
