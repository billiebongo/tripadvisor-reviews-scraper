Came here with my girlfriend and chanced on this place during a busy Saturday evening in Holland Village.
Had a grilled cauliflower salad and a selection of tapas, all superb.
Safe bet, for couples, groups, friends etc

The title pretty much sums up why you should head there. But wait, there's more: it's craft beer! :)
I ordered the polenta fries as well, a perfect pairing with beer.
