Reasonable food price and cosy environment. Must do reservation few days in advanced. Will definitely visit again. Thumb up!

The experience was disastrous. The reservation was not logged on in Soup Restaurant. Fortunately they were not full so we were able to get a table.

This is a small chain of restaurants. usually with a queue outside, so busy and popular. Service and food prompt. Would recommend

despite the chain concept, the food standard is sustainable and price is acceptable. service is good but speed need to improve

The signature chicken remains so good after a visit almost a decade ago. It is amazing I do not crave for typical chicken rice chilli for this dish. This is how delicious it is already on its own with the ginger dip. The steam meat patty with salted fish is another dish not to miss. Goes well with plain rice

I must admit that I haven't been here or any other of their branches for a year. How time flies .... maybe, knowing the chicken comes with beautiful ginger sauce but what's missing is probably like any other chickens. It comes with a beautiful chicken sauce. It lacks this here .... unfortunately to give customers a real KICK. Nevertheless, the high lights SOUP restaurant speaks for itself. We tried their soup of the day. Other signature dishes were as always good.No regrets but please bring on the Chilli sauce ...

I came to here after visiting Sentosa. It's a quiet and cozy restaurant with good sea-view. The food has high quality with careful preparation and reasonable price. Each kind of soup owns its unique and delicious taste. If you want to experience the authentic traditional home-cooked taste, this is a perfect place. However, the serving speed need to be improved

I have just patronised Soup Restaurant for the last time last Monday. In baseball parlance, first strike was while ordering, my wife seemed to be pushed to over ordering both in number of dishes as well as size. There seems to be a very obvious company directive to 'encourage' more orders. Now, we generally don't have a problem with that but this was done in a very coercive and distasteful manner. There was hardly any subtlety at all.Strike two. We were again nudged to order at least tea when what we wanted was really water (which costs $0.50). We also ordered two barley drink and added another during the meal. So total three barley drinks.When the bill came, one in our party went to pay behind our backs to avoid the usual fighting over who pays (age old Chinese tradition). And as such did not noticed that we were being charged 5 barley drinks instead. Naturally, we told them we only ordered three and wanted a refund. Staff deadpanned that it's company policy that once the bill has been settled, they can't do much about it. And even told us, we should check it first. At this point, I did not understand what the debacle was as I had already left the restaurant. The guest who paid said forget it. But one in our group said it was not right. The staff stood their ground.When I learned about it, my sense was it was only two drinks but the principle (restaurant policy or not) behind it was not right. So restaurant relented only after I ask them to consider refund of the two drinks with that of a report to authorities. To which the manager, used the cashier key and opened it and refunded immediately. Strike three. Horrible company policy over what essentially is an open and shut case of overcharging and refund. And the adamant refusal by their staff NOT to initially

Come here after our short hike at Mt Faber. Order a set menu for two though there were three of us. Because it is still CNY today, it is not crowded. Very surprising to us. Nevertheless the food is great, particularly the soup and the Samsui Chicken. Overall the price is very reasonable for CNY and ambience is good. Have a very enjoyable lunch.

I have been to Soup restaurant a few times and it has always been great, despite being a chain restaurant. Each of them have their own personality and flavour of cooking. Always a good meal there, simple dishes made right. Samsui chicken is so good, we ordered a second plate
