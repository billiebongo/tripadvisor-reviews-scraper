we came here wanting to use our entertainer app to enjoy the mains here, but instead ordered the lunch promotional sets that ended up being a better bargain. the lunch sets were quite decent as well, comes with a soup and drink.

this cool stand alone bar-F&B-establishment offers some lunch sets as well as coffee & drinks. a nice chill place to have a quiet coffee, away from the crowded CBD environment.
