This place is only hip because of its location. It’s kind of cramped, and the food is no better than Sushi Tei. Not too pricey, but that’s not enough a reason to go back.
3
Nice friendly staff and a good atmosphere. The food is OK, if not spectacular; for the price I would have expected something better.
3
Thought the food selection is so-so. Perhaps need to spice it up a little!
Want to have the special cocktail but the ran out of it, so chose the sake instead.
A small venue so small group is preferred.
1
no idea what any hype about this place is about, the food was disappointing, the service was obnoxious, the portions were small, the ambience was non-existent. don't waste your money.

Would like to express my appreciation to the staffs here! Went there on a Saturday evening and the staffs were really warm and welcoming. There were very few occupied tables that night probably cos it's on a weekend thus the good ambiance and music. If you ordered the TFS selection they will explain the details of what the main ingredients are, topped with what sauce or toppings etc. Do order the TFS maki and fried corn! Can totally feel the vibes of the flying squirrel throughout heh

Visited this little restaurant during my visit to Singapore last week. Tried the recommended TFS Premium Chirashi and it was lovely. The surprise was the salmon rice below the beautifully decorated sashimi. My husband had the wagyu burger, it was delicious too. Staff is friendly and we love the playlist. Location was a little hard to find, but managed to find our way after calling the restaurant for direction

We have been visiting the Flying Squirrel a number of times. On Friday it felt different to extend that I suggested to my better half that the outlet must have changed ownership. The interior is unchanged but there was a new enthusiastic manager, new waiting staff and the owner that were previously hands on where not there. Behind the counter was a new head chef with two what seem to be apprentice getting hands on training on a busy Friday night. Unfortunately the food experience did not match up to the standard that we were used from previous visits. For example, the Sashimi was thinly cut a la Sushi Tei and the quality of the fish did not up to standard. Unfortunately that comment goes along with more then half of the stuff we ordered. We like the place and hence I am writing in hope that my comments are well received
3
This was a business lunch; the small place was cozy and not too crowded, and the food was pretty good. However, service was spotty (our server kept forgetting our orders) and the price was much too high given the experience. Having said that, the salad portion was generous and the food quality overall is good. If you do have some cash to burn..
2
If you r looking for fried frozen bar food with tons of flour, that is the place. The manager or boss was not nice to the staffs at all. All the little girls were tense and afraid. I always believe in happy staffs happy customers... Interior is beautiful and cosy... Unfortunately... We won't go back again...
2
we ordered 3 small bites, few pieces of sashimi and some sushi, where rates were $7.50 per piece for sushi, 2 happy hour wines and 1 beer. bill was over $160 and we were still very hungry after. quality of sashimi wasn't fresh and the sushi was disappointing especially the high price we paid. Way better japanese restaurants with much better value, freshness and service. tables were set so close , within centimetres of one another I rather sit at the bar instead. NOT RECOMMENDE
5
Place is pretty hidden and interesting, food was decent, sake cocktails were quite nice, service was friendly and they pretty much leave you to yourselves. a good place to chill when you want to get away from the crowds
4
Some of the freshest sashimi. Lovely additional flavours. Small serves, but we had a seafood rice bowl which was amazing as well.
The main room was quite noisy but we had a table by the kitchen which was fascinating to watch and a little quieter.
4
Always a great choice for quality sushi at affordable prices! Make sure that you make a reservation to avoid disappointment as there is limited seating.
2
Located in a small alleyway off Amoy St. Menu highlights include the veal cheek curry, chicken karaage, and the tekka (tuna) don. Tasty all around. Out of the floor staff of three only Karl seemed to be out and about doing his job. The two ladies just stood by the kitchen window and looked sulky. Waves to attract their attention were ignored, and walking over to make my orders was greeted by curt grunts. My beer took half an hour to arrive and it took multiple entreaties to Karl, who was trying to be everywhere at once, before one of the princesses deigned to stalk over with the bottles. I'm conflicted - I want to like this place because the food is pretty good, but the service is pretty dismal.
5
It was my first time to The Flying Squirrel. Given it's upstairs location and the tight numbering on Telok Ayer Street the small door leading to the second floor is easy to miss.Our table was ready and we were swiftly being presented with the lunch menu as well as the regular menu.We opted for the assorted sushi, which was accompanied by a starter salad, a starter, the main course and ice cream for desert. So much food was clearly beyond our expectations. The food was delicious from start to finish.A nice surprise awaited us upon payment, when we were informed that as American Express members we were entitled to a 20% discount - had we mentioned it during our reservation. The restaurant was so kind to extend the discount anyway and we have noted that we need to mention American Express at the time of reservation 
3
We went there for dinner, and we ended up in disappointment, as I had high expectations for this restaurant. It was way too expensive for the quality of food presented. The tuna in our sashimi platter (which cost SGD62) wasn't fresh. Butter clams udon was nice, but the kurobuta curry rice was average. Services were decent, but we would rather go for other izakaya which provides better food with lower prices.
2
I was so looking forward for the dinner.Unfortunately the quality and presentation of the food is much below average.The combination (mix & match) of the food doesn't match (the texture and taste).The raw fish (Tuna, Salmon & Geoduck) for nigiri sushi is not fresh, but the Kohada is OK! As for the dessert, the Grape Panna Cotta is not bad, but the meringue is soggy.Personally can see the effort of the chef, they are trying very hard. They need to explore more, experiment and practise.The service crew is friendly and cheerful
4
Laid back and friendly staff. Vey nice atmosphere in this back alley restaurant. Sat at the counter (reserved the very same day), with overview of the prep area. Started with a cocktail (yuzu Prosecco), and then had beers to the food. The had a set of interesting craft beer on the counter, but for whatever reason they were out of stock of all except for the darkest, and we had to settle for the Asahi. This kind of place should have more than two types of beer. Our favorites where the Tuna Tataki, Gyoza, Spicy Maguro Maki, and then unexpectedly the cured fish. We actually liked all the servings. We payed $222 for the two of us having one cocktail and two beers each, and shared three dishes, four nigiri and two roles, and two cones. Very reasonable. I would love to give the Flying Squirrel five out of five, but it is not there yet with the menu.
1
The barman (Eric on the receipt) was very rude, other staff are generally gormless. Ended up taking my beers in a doggy back home because I was so disappointe
4
Cosy cafe in a small alley with good sushi and chirashi. We also had fine coffee, yuzu honey and honey lemon drinks. The sea salt caramel cake had old fashioned cream and soft sponge cake. Affogato - vanilla ice cream with expresso topping was delicious. Service was warm and friendly.
4
Would recommend their ume mojito, chriashi bowl and miso cod. Cosy interior and is located in a corner of the main road that can be easily missed if not for a little street sign pointing towards the alley leading to it.
3
A funky downtown restaurant with an interesting take on Japanese food. The food and wine were both good. The service was attentive and friendly.
5
This is a small restaurant and in an alley. Food is great and so is service. Not much space on the tables but food comes little by little so no problem. Better reserve in advance.
3
Funky little place off Amoy Street. I lived in Tokyo for 5 years and you could easily imagine that was where you were. Some good cocktails with the mojito with plum wine being delicious and refreshing. Food was good without being great. For 4 of us it came to about $450 including drinks and I felt like I needed a snack on the way home
4
Hard to find but worth it. The venue is off Amoy street but not on it. The rolls were great but portion of lunch set is so tiny we had to order so many other things to eat. Ended up spending $50-55 per person without any drinks - just water. Rolls we like are spicy tuna and spicy salmon. Service was ok - we had to yell out for more water. I got mosquito bites not sure if it is because restaurant was too dark. It was a bit hot inside around 12.30. Perhaps air Fon was just turned on. We may go again when we are not too hungry.
5
We went there for dinner with my Girlfriend and asked to be seated in front of the chefAll sushis, makis, chirashis and fusion food were delicious !You have to try the pumpkin croquettes and spicy salmon bruschettasAll is good and worth a tr
5
The flying squirrel serves delicious Japanese food from traditional sushis, sashimis and shirashi to more audacious variations such as fried pumpkins or tomato salmon salad. I also loved the gyosas served hot with a lemongrass sauce ! Highly recommended. Pricing is fair Though you need several dishes to be full.
5
The Flying Squirrel is a cool sushi bar tucked away in a small alley way. I went with a colleague twice for lunch in the week that I visited Singapore on business. The veggie bento box offering was delicious. The maki and inari was very good and the soba noodles with the smokey sauce were brilliant
4
Discovered this restaurant via the Survival Schic and it was a great experience. The food was great and they have a nice list of sake. The service was good and friendly. We went there to eat sushi and sashimi and the quality of the fishes was great. As the restaurant is quite small it is a good idea to book your table. Would definitely recommend this restaurant
5
I regularly go to this place, it is super cool - but small and usually crowded so make sure you book a couple days in advance or go there later in the evening.The staff is very nice and food is excellent. I recommend the spicy salmon maki
5
It's a small but cozy restaurant with a very accommodating staff. I ate at the bar with my friend and had delicious makis, sushis and beers. For me it's hard to find good Japanese food in Singapore so I'm really happy about discovering this restaurant.
4
Fresh ingrediants and nice serving. Very tasty. Good and attentive service. Great place for a quick break.
4
We stopped by the first time, couldn't get seating. Second time we sat at the bar, and ate what was probably some of the best sushi we've ever had! So make sure you have reservations ahead.
4
Introduced by a foodie girlfriend about this place. Located off the main alley, into a smaller alley way - real cute location, makes you feel like you aren't in Singapore. Entering the place, it's small, cozy place and definitely welcomed by the staff. For dinner, we had a couple of plates for sharing. TFS Signature Maki, Tempura Popcorn, Fugu Mirin (super yumx!), Tatami Iwashi. They serve this yuzu moscato as well, it was pretty good. If I am not wrong, they have quite a selection of sake. Can't wait to be back to try out their lunch menu
3
Nice vibe to the place, entrance on the side alley off Amoy Street. Food though is pretty mediocre and it's far from good value given the quality of the produce. Prawn Tempura with truffle mayo was overly oily with too much batter, Flounder, Tuna Belly and Octopus sushi were all very disappointing.The better dishes were the salmon miso plus the crab and avocado salad. Service is a positive, nice and friendly and very quick my Singapore standards.Tip - for couples it's best to be sat at the bar as the tables are very close to each other, separated by less than a foot
5
Really enjoyed my first visit to this place after hearing about it from friends. Good quality food, especially the sashimi which was very fresh. We were a group of four and we all enjoyed it and will return soon. Good personable service. Probably need to book
5
Having popped my sushi and sashimi cherry here a couple of weeks ago, it baffles me how it has taken so long to get into this type of food!!Be bold and order off piste - or trust the head chef to make recommendations as he is truly talented!The food here is absolutely sensational and sitting at the bar, chatting to the chef and watching him work made for a really memorable experience! Tip - it's small, so book. Try to get a table at the bar so that you can see what you are eating being prepared in front of your eyes
4
I went here for lunch a few times now and just love it. It has a proper lunchtime buzz about it, a hive of activity but not too jammed in, but close enough that you can see what looks good on table next door and order it. The food is really great quality and lots of choose from. Its a great place to meet friends for lunch
4
I visited this place for the first time for lunch this week. Great location in a laneway off Amoy St. Good selection of bento boxes for lunch. It's a small place so reservations are a good idea (it was totally full when we were there on a Friday). Decent atmosphere and food quality. Worth another visit
4
I ordered one of their curry ebi bento sets for take away. I was so suprised by the exquisite boxes they used to contain the food. The food was great and the portions were just nice. I would definitely come back again! However the price is slightly expensive than usual.
5
TFS as they call themselves has a very convenient lunch menu. Bento's in several varieties. Good food with veggies, fish, rice and fruit. Brought with a smile and attention to detail. Price was reasonable for the quality of the food.
4
This restaurant is a little gem in Singapore. Food is great and service is friendly.
As the restaurant is quite small, you need to book a table.
Was a great experience and I'll return for sure.
5
Upon entry to the flying squirrel you are greated my many smiling faces. The atmosphere is great, service is attentive and fast, and the food is excellent!
Highly recommended!
4
Visited the place for the first time and food was excellent. Japanese fusion type. We had the sashimi platter, tfs signature maki and tfs chirashi. Will definitely visit again. Place a little small..kinda noisy though..
5
Hidden along Amoy Street. Lotsa things to try and different from the usual japanese restuarant menu. Avocado crab salad is a must for all salad fans. The wagyu burger without the bun is a surprise and is awesome. Yuzu processco is delightful and you may yearn for more.Sea salt is superb desert please order in advance. There are more to try and am going back for more
5
Went with a friend and really enjoyed the meal we had. The flying squirrel is a small and cozy bar/restaurant hidden down a side roadSushi quality was very good and the staff were all friendly. Apparently one of the owners is a well know music star in SingaporeWill certainly go agai
4
Came here earlier this year with a friend. Great quality food but not very much of it for the price you pay. Recommend for a nice place for a girlie catch-up and a glass of wine. Menu not huge but chose the blackened cod in miso sauce - that's great! Good background music too
4
The sashimi was really fresh and tasty! Affordable price tag as well! Friendly and pretty attentive (probably because it is a quite a small place) service throughout our dinner. However, we were sitting near the toilet and customers kept going in and out of toilet without closing the door so we had to keep asking the waitress to close the door (and I observe that they didn't wash their hands after closing the door, prior to collecting the empty plates from our table) Hope the store can look into installing some sort of divider to keep out the unglamorous sight of the toilet
5
Ive visited this place twice. Both times i had the salmon carpaccio. Because it is ridiculously good! We tried the rols and the sushi, everything was as good as it looks! It ia literally a hole in the wall as it's not that easy to find if ure not familiar with the place. But it sure us worth the hunt! They have a nice selection of wines and drinks to go with thw food as well. The price is not on the low side, but you cant really complain coz everything comes out great! One minor quibble, the place is small so there's not a lot of room to fir big parties. But just perfect for small groups. :) Just be sure to make a reservation so this wont be a problem
5
I have been twice here and i will definitely come back every time i get to Singapore. The food is of high quality and the service is friendly. I really enjoyed every dish I tried, specially the salmon carpaccio- one of the best dishes I've ever tried. A must go for all the japanese food lovers in singapore
4
Worthy of sharing as this restaurant is a hidden gem along Amoy Street. Must reserve in advance. Casual atmosphere, small and cosy, good and fresh food.
5
My son and hubby are not into Japanese cuisine! They are both converted. Thanks to your excellent chefs and lovely service.
5
A small restaurant with great food! The quality of the food is thumbs up!! Really Amazing! Definitely will go back again.
4
Look, I cannot fault the quality of food at the Flying Squirrel. The sushi, sashimi and hot food offerings are, frankly, some of the best food in Singapore, and at reasonable prices considering the superb quality.The staff are friendly, knowledgeable and helpful, and the atmosphere is intimate and buzzy. A recommendation... Book in advance!My ONLY minor moan is that both times I have visited, mid week and between 8 and 9 pm, there were no fresh oysters. They'd run out. Last trip no oysters AND no gyoza. This is a good thing, I know. It means the food is fresh and that they don't stockpile which is the sign of a great restaurant. But it's still annoying! A minor quibble however as what we did eat was fantastic. Well worth a visit
4
First, you must find Flying Squirrel -- it's on an alley off Amoy Street, so all you see on the street is a small, darkish sign pointing to your mecca. The advantage is the quiet (if you eat outside). Inside it's cozy, attentive, with all the (rather small) portions beautifully presented. The salmon sashimi was the best I've ever had, mouth-melting. A bit of a wait for the cod, but it was spectacularly good. The chairs/stools are not made for lingering, more for a quick in and out which is a shame since the food was so good. Hence the downgrade for "romance." Main courses are $25-35, and small. The crab and avocado salad is lovely
4
The restaurant is a little jem at Amoy Street-love the setup of the place-reminds of me a little quaint pub in Tokyo. You can't fault anything at the restaurant-sashimi is fresh, fried chicken is yummy and the curry is also to die for. Highly recommended for both lunch and dinner.The service is excellent and totally love how proactive the staff are! With new group of friends that I go with, they never fail to have good things to say about the food and service.Well done! Please continue to keep up with the consistency of the food and service.Try the chirashi don, chicken karage and ebi curry
4
This cosy restaurant amongst the shop-houses of China Town is a great little find, and you'd be hard pressed to find such good value, good quality Japanese food in this part of town. Not bad value wine too. Book ahead if you can as there aren't many tables, and it's deservedly popular. Can't wait to go back
5
I like the exact location of where the restaurant is located, after entering the place, it gives a homely cosy feeling. We were there for a birthday celebration, the food is really good. Staff are friendly and responsive. One thing to note is that, they served good food not fast food. :
5
Had dinner with my fiancÃ©e at The Flying Squirrel and I have to say the quality of japanese food here is really excellent. The sushi is so fresh and they get it right with a generous portion of seafood with just the right amount of sushi rice. The restaurant is very cosy and tastefully decorated but reservations are highly recommended as its a small place. Definitely one of Singapore's best kept secret. Glad that we discovered this place. Will definitely be back again and again! Oh and lastly, it's really value for money as well.
5
We found this place on a 4am jet lagged walk around town. Went back 14 hours later and luckily got a couple of seats at the bar. I'd recommend booking though. The food was sensational - try the cod and tiger prawns. The taste is unlike anything my wife and I have had before
4
Great little restaurant in Chinatown that offers Japanese fusion with a spin. This place is always booked, so you better reserve to make sure you get a seat. A bit difficult to find, it is in a small back alley.
4
Perfect for a light japanese dinner in an intimate setting. Make a reservation to get a table if you don't want to sit at the bar. Sushi and gyoza were excellent and perfect with Asahi. Would stay away from the white wine though!
4
if you love sake, and having sushi, this is the place that you should go!
sushi and sashimis are good! and if you like uni, they have uni shot for you to try it on !
4
The sushi was very good. The restaurant has five tables . People working there are very friendly. I will recommend this restaurant .
4
Just happened to walk past it on a side-street, and decided to go back after venturing up to the Fulton's rooftop bar. It exceeded expectations, and was exactly the little hole-in-wall we had hoped for. Cold Asahi; fresh sushi, and other bits and pieces, it was the end to a perfect night. It was above and beyond some of the over priced places (and underwhelming places) we had visited. I recommend making the effort to find this little haunt, and if the search gets a little too much, stop in to one of the many Korean BBQ's in the area before carrying on
5
I’ve always found the flying squirrel great for lunch or a late afternoon coffee as it’s so close to the CBD. Although it can be a little hard to find, being down a lane off Amoy street, I think this lends to its charm as it remains down to earth and unpretentious. The menu offers Japanese-inspired cuisine, one dish not to miss is the Truffle Ebi Fry
4
You could easily miss this place, it’s in a by lane. The place is small, unpretentious and crowded and I suggest you make a reservation. Seating is in small tables or along the bar counter and very informal. The food is Japanese but the presentation and the way they put things together is contemporary and infuses fresh energy into the done and dusted Sushi/Sashimi etc. Service takes a while, so plan accordingly. This place is hip and fun to dine in
5
We came as a party of 13, half filing the place, but they coped beautifully, we had a great time and were in celebratory mood. The food was fantastic, the staff cheerful and helpful. If you decide to go I hope, for your sake, we're not there! I'm planning to e-mail them to beg for their avocado salad recipe!
4
Flying Squirrel is tucked away in a hidden side street (off Amoy Street) and is clearly aiming to be a hidden, hole-in-the-wall, destination dining place - something that makes people feel a sense of discovery, and leads to a lot of word-of-mouth recommendations. When you take away that veneer of marketing, it is still a pretty decent Japanese restaurant, reminiscent of several such places in Japan (where the small size is a necessity, not a marketing ploy), complete with bar stools. The place is quite buzzy with a friendly wait staff. I was there for lunch but it seemed like they have some funky, innovative cocktails and so it would be worth a return visit in the evening.I had a lunch set of karage (Japanese KFC), which was quite good - and for the sort of place - not very pricey. The California hand rolls - though presented nicely in a wine glass - were somewhat uninspired. Overall, a decent new addition to the downtown dining scene, though worth following up and seeing how long they can keep it up
4
The sushi is really nice, fresh and portioned just perfect. I ordered a lunch set that consists of a variety of fish sushi, salad, karaage chicken, and a few slices of fruit. I don't usually like fish, but I love what they served.The price is a little steep in my opinion, but it can be forgiven because of the tasty food and the nice service.Full menu can be seen here: http://www.theflyingsquirrel.com.sg/#!lunchmenu/czjiThe downside, however, the place is really small. There are around 20 seats only, and me and my friend were seated at the bar. The "table" was really small, and the chairs were shaky. For those who are interested in coming, booking is advised
