The food was delicious and we were very full afterwards! The staff were helpful and friendly. Was a little pricey but was a wonderful meal.

Been wanting to explore nice food.
Haven't been eating Lebanese food for a while. I use to had it at Holland V.
This platter is extremely worth it and good for sharing.
Pita is freshly make and loving it.

We ordered the fish curry and Lebanese chicken tikka at Le Rida. The food was delicious and the staff were also attentive. Overall, it was a good experience!

French, middle Eastern and Indian dishes all served from the same kitchen. Sounds like a recipe for disaster but the food comes out pretty decent. Freshly made Indian breads and curries are the best option.

Le Rida is a restaurant that you simply must visit if you enjoy Mediterranean & Indian cuisine. The food is simply fabulos and the service staff are polite & courteous. It was value for money if you enjoy food that is well-cooked with spices and a place where you be with a friend and have a meaningful & uninterrupted conversation. I highly recommend it if you are tired of the Chinese, Malay & local cuisine that you find in Sâ€™pore.Cecili

The middle eastern food served at Le Rida was authentic, fresh tasting and delicious. This is some of the best food I've had from the cuisine. Highly recommend ordering the mezze platter, kebabs and baklava. According to the owner, they make everything from scratch in-house and that really comes through in the food they serve, a must visit

Food was tasty and good. The ambience is nice and no hustle bustle. They should hire a couple of more people to speeden up the service. We were 8 of us. The portion sizes were small so we had to order again.Overall a nice place even for Vegetarians like us. Will definitely recommend to others and will visit again too. The staff "Guru" was very kind.

Stopped here for a quick beer recently whilst walking in the area. 2 Erdingers for about $20 all in: quite good value. Didn't try the food but looked like a fairly decent menu. The beer was cold and was served efficiently. A good choice if you're in the vicinity

Having become a frequent visitor to Le Rida, I am mightily impressed with multiple aspects of this restaurant. The menu list is extensive and one can choose from Mediterranean, Indian and French Cuisine depending on his/her preference and taste. Items are reasonably priced as compared to some of the more extravagant outlets in the heart of the city which is a bonus given the great quality of the food which Le Rida serves. The staff is very friendly and does its best to make customers feel comfortable. The nice vibe around the place makes it a suitable spot for catching up with friends and family alike. Le Rida also serves some great desserts, snacks and alcoholic drinks - Affordably priced beers and cocktails during happy hours are another plus point. I would highly recommend Le Rida to folks out there who are looking for quality food at a comfortable place

Has multiple cuisines, good choice of beers on tap and a casual place. I tried the Mediterranean food which was of good quality. They also have Indian and French. I recommend this place but do not expect a lot as it caters for good food and reasonable prices with decent service without the hype and ambiance, etc

I had to meet a student for dinner, and this was close to my apartment, so we tried it. We both had excellent Indian food at reasonable prices. This is a safe bet if you are hungry for Indian food.
5
You go there for good food, reasonable prices and decent service. Period :)
Sadly , location and ambiance not much to shout about.
5
Love that the place screens soccer matches too! Parking easily found at nearby housing streets. food was good and filling, service is on point.
4
It is like a nice neighbourhood bar and restaurant serving three different menus with most of the stuff pretty good. Went with a bunch of friends and tried different items on the menu. Must say food was good and service impeccable.

Good little place tucked away in Bukit Timah. The middle eastern favourites of hummus and pita bread was good, as was the mixed grill. Prices same as Arab Street.
5
The restaurant has multiple cuisines. I had Mediterranean (Lebanese) which was good quality. They try to make there service good and it is reasonably priced. Ambiance is a personal choice but it is open and airy ....... casual place for a meal that suits me fine ..... It is well worth a try ......

Food was good - ordered the tandoori salmon ($22++) and tandoori chicken ($15.90++) from the Indian menu. Marination could have been slightly more flavourful, but the meat/fish was generally well-cooked and moist. Ordered a side of pita ($4 for four pieces) to go along with the meal - while it was freshly baked, it would have been nice if the restaurant could provide a complimentary dip since we weren't ordering any curries as the bread was a little plain to be eaten on its own. Masala tea was delicious - fragrant, milky and not overly sweet (additional sachets of sugar were provided for the sweet-toothed, but we didn't find it necessary). Service was attentive and friendly, although the staff took very long to serve the drinks. In all, a decent restaurant worth a revisit.

This place always has promotion and generous discounts. I have been there several times and feel satisfied after each visit. Love the lamb mendi, mixed grill, peta bread, confit de carnard, lamp chop. Casual ambience for gathering of a few friends. Beers are reasonably priced too.
5
A surprisingly quiet place given the high quality of food. Our cold mezze platter was extremely tasty - the hummus was smooth and went nicely with freshly baked pita bread. The beef kebab was tender, nicely charred and delicious.Before we arrived, we had a bit of mix-up over the phone regarding the terms and conditions of a voucher, but the manager that night was kind enough to make an exception and take responsibility for his staff's error. Great and attentive service! Will be back agai

Prasad, the owner/manager of Le Rida, tells me that cooking and serving great food is a passion for him. I totally agree. From the hummus to the koftas to the North Indian seekh kebab, the food at this gem of a restaurant is delicious. It avoids the fatal flaw other restaurants make of over-spicing and adding a dollop of oil to the food they serve. I heartily recommend a visit. The restaurant is right on Bukit Timah Road, but in a quiet section, and once in, the food takes up all the attention
5
A great hangout spot with delicious Middle Eastern food. Try the tandoori chicken! The waiters were very accommodating to our two-year old.

Had Mediterranean vegetarian food along with kebabs meat and seafood.
Simply awesome. .
Good staff
Good service
Good location
Just perfect. .

Having been to Greece and having loved their food (my rheumatologist agreed that he had never seen me healthier after my Greece trip!), I had been searching high and low for a Greek restaurant here in SGP. I shall not name names but even the very popular Greek place that moved to Dempsey almost caused me to give up cos the meat there was dry and the dishes were overpriced. My friend and I discovered this place by chance and boy, are we glad!! The tenderest of meats, the most delish of hummus and tzatzikis, the freshest of vegs and the biggest of platters I had ever seen!! One can taste the love that was put into preparing the food. Juicy and succulent. The service was exceptional!! The staff we lovely, patient and entertained our every qtn before we ordered. My friend is equally as picky as me when it comes to specific cuisines and we both loved it! We were yakking the whole night and no one chased us away! The owner came over to chat with us and I swear I felt like I was back in Greece, tucked away in a little shop off the streets, with lovely food and great ambience. My friend and I agreed that we have found our little hangout haven and that we will be back...

Having recently moved over from the East to serviced apartments off Bukit Timah Road, we were dreading not finding a middle east restaurant of the quality we were used to getting in the Arab quarter. We stumbled upon Le Rida on our first Saturday night out exhausted from unpacking and had a lovely evening with excellent Lebanese food. My husband loved the fatoush and I really enjoyed the vine leaves. We shared a mix grill platter which was very tasty and more than enough for 2 people. The wine was reasonably priced. I returned today some 10 days after my first visit to have lunch with a friend and it was nice that they recognised me. We shared a dish of hummus with lovely warm pitta breads and followed this by sharing a dish of lamb skewers with rice. The rice itself is excellent with the addition of pomegranate seeds, raisins and pine nuts making it even more special. More than enough for 2! My guest and I loved the food and the service was faultless - extremely friendly and welcoming. It was so good I'm going back again tomorrow to try out the french dishes for my birthday. The only negative is that the restaurant is open sided and by the road, but you can tuck yourself in and you very quickly forget the road noise in the pleasure of good food and service. Keep up the good work

It wasn't bad, but wasn't great either. Admittedly we only had a Mediterranean entree - feta cheese spring rolls, which were hollow and very poor. The mains were Indian and with soo much competition around for Indian cuisine, the meal was average and far too expensive to have me return. Very quiet and felt under pressure to finish
4
I had dinner here with my family last night. We ordered a basket of naan, lamb roganjosh, grilled salmon pasta and the lamb mixed grill. The pasta was a little dry but the grilled salmon was well-cooked. The grilled lamb tasted good too. While the lamb roganjosh was nice, the portion seemed small. The atmosphere is quiet and suitable for couples/ families to have a cozy dinner. Overall, we had an enjoyable experience here

We had my husbands birthday party here last night , Prasad and his crew were fantastic. They made us feel very welcome and even played my husbands Favourite music. Not forgetting the lovely curries and and seafood. Thank you for a great evening. We will definitely return

Situated halfway between Sixth Ave & King Albert Park MRT, it takes about 5 min walk to reach Le Rida. It is an open aired restaurant. We went on Monday night so it was indeed very quiet that evening.We purchased a Fave voucher of Sirloin steak meal with wine for 2 @ SGD 40. We also ordered one entree and a desert. The steak was a descent size and was actually very tender and flavorsome. However the house-pour red was not very nice.Overall it was a OK experience but Le Rida won't be my choice of place if I want to impress someone

I tried the Lebanese Mutton Kofta kabab and Chicken kabab which were great. The Pitta were hot and fresh, loved the egg plant and chickpeas curry. They also have Indian cuisine on the menu and they are delicious and authentic. Service is good too. If you want to try a traditional lebanese food, this restaurant is highly recommended. Their manager Mr. Sawaliya is a very humble and friendly guy, he can customise the menu based on you need and pax. The drinks menu has got lot of choice and price is very reasonable.

It was a good dinner but I found it a little strange to have Lebanese, French and Indian cuisine on the menu. The Mediterranean hummus went well with Indian naan!! Had Lebanese lamb and tandoori chicken. All things considered... the food was good and prices reasonable.
5
We have been there a couple of times. Le Rida never failed to disappoint us! We always order mixed grilled plater and the mezze platter for sharing. The staff are friendly as well.
Highly recommend!

The food is authentic and delicious. Service is good too. A highly recommended restaurant for traditional mediterranean food.

What a fantastic find. Fairly new and so still needs a bit of work to brighten up the walls but the food is fantastic. Cold mezze, hot mezze, kebabs, you can go wrong. Best pitta bread anywhere. Drinks prices are unreal.
4
Had the lamb chops, ribeye steak, grilled salmon and all of them were excellent. The potato gratin that came with the steak was delicious. Food was as good as our previous visit.
5
Awesome Lebanese food and extremely friendly service.
After spending 15 years living in Bahrain, great after 1 year in Singapore to find authentic and delicious Lebanese food.
Would recommend to all.
4
Food portion is large, good for sharing. I ordered chicken pasta. Restaurant is right beside a bus stop.
5
Excellent food as we have live in Dubai for many years, now live in Singapore and have searched for a good Lebanese.
Great staff, very friendly.
Good selection of drinks both non and alcoholic.
Definitely worth a visit!
Will be our new local!

Le Rida serves a great variety of delicious food and drinks. We had Mezze and meat skewer from the grill. It was excellent. The serving sizes were big enough to share and the prices reasonable. We felt welcome, the service was very friendly. I highly recommend this place

Really nice new find on Bulit Timah but set back enough from noisy traffic. Great food and variety with portions just right. An unassuming place with minimal decor but focused on the right things - a memorable customer experience through tasty , good quality food, great service and excellent caring service. The only thing that could've been better that night was my Margarita but then again, it's not a Mediterranean speciality!! Will definitely go again. And again.

We had go to Le Rida for dinner last night and were pleasantly surprised. We found that the food was delicious and so were the drinks. We ordered humus, felafel, fatoush salad, mixed olives, stewed okra (bamiya), grilled prawns and lamb kebabs. The bread was absolutely fresh and the laban as well as the after dinner mint tea, were also refreshing. The decor is simple and clean. I liked that it was simple as it made us feel relaxed.Go here for a casual evening out with friends or family
