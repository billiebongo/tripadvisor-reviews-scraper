Try the JapChae with octopus. Spicy and sweet. Mixed with the anchovy from the side dish. Yummy. The portion is big for 1 person.

We come here fairly regularly and always enjoy the food. The hotpots and doekbokki are amazing. Sometimes it's hard to flag down a waiter, but still worth it.

This is the third time we are back n I must say that the quality of food has detoriated badly! Somehow, the exterior of the restaurant has a mouldy smell.... Hope they can do something about it..

Found this restaurant in a big shopping center in Clarke Quay. It was 3 p.m., my husband and I were so hungry so we decided to go in to this restaurant randomly. We got free side dishes and we took bimbimbap and jajangmyun with upgrade menu for extra 3.90 Sing Dollar (one drink and one appetizer incl.). The food was soo tasty and the appetizers (kimchi dumpling and kimchi pancake) were great. The drink (homemade lemon tea with jelly) was lecker and not too sweet. The service was great. Feel so lucky to find this restaurant. We went out with full tummy and happy face.

As I had never eaten Korean food before, I was a bit hesitant when my Singaporean fiancÃ© suggested Seoul Yummy. I should not have been worried, the food was plentiful and delicious.The staff are very friendly and attentive, making our dining experience so much more enjoyable.Would definitely recommend Seoul Yumm

Ate the assorted meat army stew filled with beef, pork, chicken, spam, sausage, enoki mushroom, kimchi etc. The soup itself taste very nice after we let it cooked and boiled for a while. Remember to ask additional soup especially when the soup has left with half

We walked into this place at 1230 and were lucky to get a table immediately even though the table was adjoining the kitchen. They gave us several menus which was confusing so we opted for their lunch specials, Bibimpap Chicken and Eel. The food came quite quickly. In hot stone bowls that kept it piping hit until the end. With sauces on the side. Both dishes were yummy and large but got cleaned out despite the spice! The crisp burnt rice at the bottom was great. The sides of potato pancakes is not to be missed. The complementary lemon tea was just right without being too sweet and with the unusual addition of jelly noodles. We were impressed by the hygiene level maintained during cooking and serving. The total bill fir three of us was about SGD 50 only! We look forward to coming back during our next trip to Singapore.

I ordered yummy bibimbap. It wasn't your normal bibimbap, but I wanted normal room temperature, not the dolsotbibimbap. I asked if they could do it room temperature(normal) and she said no. So I ordered the special and it cost 19 dollars because you are forced to order an appetizer too.THis bowl of greasy brown mayonnaise comes out and tastes like garbage. I ate one of the fried dumplings(appetizer) and got up paid my bill and left. No one asked me if it was bad or good. I lived in Korea for 6 years and love the cuisine. This was a travesty. I am eating lunch at a diff restaurant nearby and writing this. ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTIN

Visited for lunch with colleagues.Simple cosy quiet place for lunch after 1.30pm. Helpful waiters and waitresses. Nice food at affordable prices. Estimated about $20 per person inclusive main course and drink. Occasionally they offer credit card discount about 10-15% off main course, please check before making payment

We had staycation at hotel next to the mall and was looking to have a sumptuous dinner for our wedding anniversary. We were early and only 2 other tables occupied. Staff (manager & senior staff) offered a lukewarm welcome as we entered the restaurant .... but newbie wait staff who served us was more enthusiastic. We ordered the $48.90++ spicy army stew set combo which came with a side & a dessert. ( we ordered savory wings & choco banana Bingsu) .. For my kid I ordered rice $2 ++ and extra steamed egg $3.80++After serving the rice and army stew 15mins later ... the staff informs us they ran out of steam eggs for the evening ( at 6.30pm I was not impressed). Looking thru the menu there was not much non spicy options so ended up ordering an extra ginseng chicken soup at $15.90++ for my kid's dinner. Overall food tastes palatable however portions were mediocre and not value for money. They cud hv beef up stew with less pricey stuff like veggies but only 3/4 filled pot. Ginseng chick soup was also 3/4 pot filled. Fried chicken tasted badly refried & sauce slapped on. Bingsu was disappointed as crushed peanuts had rancid smell , choc powder tasted cheap and the only salvation for the dessert was the fine ice shavings! Overall one visit is more than enough as I did not find my final spend of $90/- worth the portion & quality of food served and also overall average service experience.
