This place is really not worth the hype , all parathas are made out of maida also the Indian food is full of bad harmful color and cold and expensive . there are many indian and other restaurants serving great food just across the corner
2
Paid $7.50 for maggi goreng ayam?? Small portion and not satisfying. Nothing much to rave about this place, probably only good for late night food, since it's 24 hours
4
This place is halal restaurant, means no pork.
Th mutton briyani, roti pratta and murtabak were excellent, mouth watering foods!
Price is fair, place is quite clean, without aircon, at the road side.
4
I always tend to gravitate to Al Jilani when I am in Singapore, always open and good value for the money food. They have expanded their menu since the last time I visited, but the standard dishes are still up to scratch.
4
Cheap and delicious. Beautiful fluffy prata with most tasty curry sauce. Flavourful variety of noodles and curries. It is halal. The Kopi and Teas were delicious too. The staff are friendly and pleasant.
5
The best beef black pepper rice i have this far..though the fried rice are so-so according to my husband..unfortunately the sitting area is quite small and outside near the road..the price are $7 for beef and $10 for fried rice
5
Nothing fancy about Al Jilani. Just really good food. Cheap. 24 hours.We ate here several times on a recent holiday. All the food was great. Much better than we had in more expensive places.The Mee Goreng was a highlight.It will be on our list for our next visit to Singapore
5
We had dinner once in this restaurant and what we ordered and what was served was entirely different. We ordered Chicken Biryani and what got served was Fried Rice with a chicken piece. Not a good experience but the good part of this restaurant is that it is functional all 24 Hrs
3
Decided to give it a try when we walked pass the place one day. Do note that this is a non air-conditioned place. We ordered fried fish, cheese & egg pratas, mee goreng and teh tarik. In summary, we’ve had better ones. You may wish to drop by here if you are lazy to go elsewhere for ur supper fix, or else - there are better ones elsewhere. If I had to say something which I liked, it would be the teh tarik - smooth and not too sweet (I’d asked for it).Our meal cost $16 and tasted average
3
This is my usual hangout for prata and ginger tea, when my daughters have their dance lessons at NAFA, which is just next to it.It is okay, not really exceptional, think there are better prata places. But still a good place to rest my legs and sit down for some food and drink
4
I used to live near this restaurant. It has a long list of menu for Indian prata, like mushroom, strawberry, and banana. I always like to eat it with a bottle of ice Milo.
4
No matter what time you need to eat you always know that this place will be open. Great tasting food at a reasonable price.
3
If you have hunger for biryani this place is good restaurant to visit - bencoolen street is a pretty busy street and easily accessible from mrt station. Biryani rice are a bit sweet but thats how many prepare biryani not very spicy.
4
On a Tuesday morning, at 3:30am, I gotten hungry and went down from Hotel G to seek for food.
Was I surprised to see a crowded restaurant just beside my hotel.
Al Jilani serve Indian Food.
Chicken Briyani & Lime juice really hit the spot.
4
I like the location of the restaurant. It is on one of the busiest street in SG. It is also easy to get a spot in Al Jilani. The briyani rice itself taste sweeter than other Briyani rice such as the Zam Zam's.
4
A couple of steps away from where I stayed, its open 24hrs, love the prata so much, the plain prata & curry is a quick fix for a late night hunger!
2
We were excited that there was a supposed 24 hour roti prata restaurant next door to Hotel G, where we were staying for a few days in Singapore. Unfortunately our experience did not match those of others here: we had a very average food experience.Firstly, the staff appeared disinterested and listless, however we ignore this and sat ourselves at one of the outdoor tables lining the sidewalk. Note: This is not a "restaurant" in the western definition: it is a local eating place which is fully opened onto the street next to the busy main road. The roti prata, our first food stop this time in Singapore was disappointing: cold, hard and slightly soggy prata that obviously was not made to order, and must have been sitting around for a while; it lacked the traditional soft flaky and crispy texture. The curry gravy that accompanied the roti was ordinary too, and slightly cold. The teh tarik was similarly average, and way too sweet. Overall, we got the impression that this food place benefits from its position near university colleges and businesses, and though prices are cheap, you can definitely obtain better versions of all we tried in other places
5
This is my most frequented eatery in Singapore, partly because it's close to my hotel, partly because it's open 24 hours, but mainly because the food is cheap and delicious. I call here pretty much every night, usually for a late night snack before heading back to my hotel. Sometimes it's my main meal of the day, depending on where I've been. I usually go for the prata, sometimes onion, sometimes cheese & onion, all come with a little dish of tasty curry sauce for dipping. If it's my main meal, I tend to go for the sweet and sour, nasi goreng, or whatever is recommended by the friendly and efficient staff. Washed down with an iced tea on a warm night, this experience can't be beaten. Plastic tables, chairs, plates and cups, traffic going by on a busy street, for me, this is what Singapore is all abou
5
It's so hard to looking for 24hr food market or restaurant near Ibis Bencoolen... Al Jilani such a strategic place when u looking for something to eat in middle of the night . The restaurant open 24hr and the food was great . I've tried Biryani chicken and plain Prata..... wooooo so yummy..
5
Just had lunch here, chicken curry. Came served as a bowl of curry gravy with a chicken breast, on the bone with skin on, sat in the gravy. Wonderful flavour, plus two parathas and a glass of lime juice drink, all for sin$8.50, approx Â£4.65. Will go agai
4
Located on Bencoolen street, next to the entrance of G hotel. They have outdoor seating, the staffs are friendly. Highly recommended if you want good Indian food with cheap price. They open 24 hours.
4
Very nice restaurant, located opposite to fortune tower. Veg & Non-veg food are available at cheapest rate. Food having good taste & value for money.
4
The food was great and price fair. I had the chicken biryani and it was very tasty. The restaurant is open pretty much 27 hours a day. I would go back, definitely.
5
We were advised to eat here by the hotel reception and I am pleased we did. The food was very tasty and we all tucked in. It is a very popular place to eat.
5
This restaurant is very gooooddd!!!!! I like the kwey teow and fried rice. The location is near Bencoolen. The waiter is friendly.
5
When i go to singapore Al Jilani is a must restoran i have to visit. One famous Muslim Indian food in heart of Singapore.With his fried chicken i think the best i ever found in singapore. So crunchy so tasty. U can combaine with Telur Balado or Egg spacy. And drink with longan ice. Hmm i really like this combination.It is open 24 hours. But chicken will not serve from 5 to 11 morning if I am not wrong.Just come and enjoy this restorant.
4
Always love the curry here which matches the prata. We are here even after dinner just 30 minutes ago. Forgot to take pics but no worry the food here is still good to eat.Better eat at night cos no air con so it's kind hot even at night
4
I was staying at a nearby hotel and opted to try the mutton murtabak here instead of hoofing it to Victory Murtabak on Arab Street. Al Jilani was closer by, open 24 hours, and had very tasty (and generous portions of) murtabak. The biryani also looked very nice, but I was already stuffed. I also had the Tarik Teh and that was also excellent. Service was also prompt and courteous. Typically, I've also received some sliced cucumber with a mild chili sauce but this was not offered here. I was kind of glad, since the mutton murtabak was sufficient
4
Excellent and subtle flavours with toothsome portions of mutton, cooked to perfection. The breads were nothing to write home about, under cooked onion in one and 'plastic' processed cheese in the other. Clean tables and utensils, happy waiters and cold drinks, open 24/7 so always a place to get a feed. Prices not to bad, paid 20SGD for 2 full adults with a soft drink each
3
I hate to give any restaurant an average score, and I'm sure everyone who gave a good/excellent review really enjoyed their meal, but my travel buddy and I were disappointed when we were served cold prata that weren't crispy. Later in the day, I brought my travel buddy - a first-timer in Singapore - to Tekka Market where we enjoyed excellent prata. Even he remarked that Al Jilani's was not up to par
5
For the Indian culinary fans, this restaurant has lots of tasty foods for you. I would suggest you try the Biryani rice with Mutton.
4
Great place for a late night snack, pepper chicken was tasty! Right next to the hotel we were staying at
4
Located near sim lim and nearby ibis and big hotels it's a great place to grab a bite of you are feeling pekish.. Think the place is 24/7.
Portions are really good..it's a streetfood place and reasonably popular.
4
Its so close from where we stayed at Ibis Bencoolen only crossing the road. Good food, large portion and halal. And also good service compared to most of other places here. I love the Briyani rice with mutton.
4
I love the briyani and all they fried noodle/bee hoon, my friend likes the roti John. Murtabak and prata is so so.we always come here when we are starving in the middle of the night... good place open 24hrs, service is quite fast and always packed
5
We were staying at ibis at ben coolen and found this restaurant at the end of our street, it was truly a treat. Their dishes esp anda curry (egg curry), daal (lentils) and rice was a truly fulfilling and savoury meal. We used to stop by for milo or shake and it was really good. The staff is very courteous and suggests you if you cant decide what to eat. We went to bali and then came back to singapore after a week and even after visiting all the places, the taste and spices of this place brought us back to its tables asking for more. Must try!!!
4
So we had been walking around the Bugis street and wanted to have a filling lunch. Came across this place with good veg and non-veg curry, parantha and indian food options. Two of us had a very satisfying meal in just 8 Dollars. They had various indian rice, breads, vegetables, curries available
4
Tables were full even late into the night especially on weekends. Instead of waiting on a table, I opted for take away and had supper in my hotel room across the street. Simple yet hearty Indian-Malay food to satisfy my late night hunger pangs - thumbs up
3
This restaurant provides Indian food, The taste are good ( we had prata, chicken briyani, nasi goreng and chicken murtabak), halal and at a very good price. Everything come in big portions. It seems every single meal can be shared for at least 2 people. What was also good was that it open 24 hrs and the staff are friendly too
4
I stay on ibis bencoolen hotel and this restauran is very near in front of hotel.The food are halal and open 24 hour.I order chicken briyani 6$ and cheese prata,the milk tea was so good and The portion really big for me,it can for 2 peoples.the taste really good and the staff really nice.I take away every night over my stay.Will recommend to other
4
I loved the food at good Price.
Ordered:
1 Chicken Biryani
1 Coke
Biryani was its own kind which was a little sweet
Ambience: Tables & Chairs on Footpath. Not a great place but good.
4
Easily accessible. Right next door to big hotel Singspore. Have wide range of quick Indainfood ranging from Nans to rottismto different types of rice. Dinning is in the side walk. Good outdoor dining experience e 24hrs aday
5
Eating at Al Jilani Restaurant was one of the highlights of our Singapore Tour. Great value for money, finger licking street food and super fast service. Staff is friendly. 24 Hours open with Halal food. Highly recommended; chicken fried noodles, cheese paratha, tea with milk.
4
Al Jilani is great for having a late night snack such as nasi lemak or roti prata, with a tea tarik on the side. The food is not haute cuisine, but certainly acceptable for the price, and the tea tarik that they serve is good.
1
Food was horrible. Not worth spending. Place is not clean and I don't want to imagine how the kitchen looks like.
5
The best nasi salmon ever and the pratas are divine. Friendly, good and fast service. Smokers welcome.
5
I have spent lot of time having meals in this restaurant when visiting Singapore and stay around that areas. My youngest daughter loves the biryani with red chicken and tea tarik. The vendors alway very friendly with customer. The best thing is 24 hours services. Highly recommended for all type of foods
3
In such a great food destination as Singapore, the food here does NOT stand out. However, the place is open until late and then open again quite early. If you are staying at the Ibis Hotel across the street, it is a nice cheaper alternative to the hotel restaurant in off hours. The breakfast prata is probably their best dish. The service is super fast and very friendly
5
Stayed at the ibis and found this place just across the road. Fantastic food, huge choice served quick on clean plates and cutlery. My favourite street food in Singapore so far. I recommend their juices highly!! One thing I would say is remember to pay when served and not at the end of the meal, this was something I was unaware of as a newbie to Singapore.
3
The speed of the food delivery was impressive. Less then 3 mins after order. Selection of food was good. Food was only so so. Didn't have the roti so wouldn't comment on it. The bulk of the seating is on the kurb side. Smoking was allowed and traffic was busy so the place is loud, hot and smelt of exhaust fume
3
Okay.Indonesian mutton Biriyani similar to Indian-Little sweet.Open all through even late at night.Nothing more.
3
opened all night with nice indian food but not only, nice pratas and chicken dishes.The price is correct
4
For $7 (£3.50) I had a really good mutton biryani with lots of meat which I wasn't expecting due to the low price.
Highly recommended.
4
Good quality of food with reasonable price and excellent friendly service. I always visit this resto when visiting Singapore.
5
It was the nearest halal restaurant near our ibis hotel bencoolen, and it opened 24 hours. How convenient... Roti prata was warm, crispy and yummy. Ate it with curry or white sugar. They had wide selection of food, indian, thai or mid east. And their service was excellent. Fast and super friendly. Don't expect to sit in a comfy restaurant though, it was on the pedestrian walk and we sat on the wooden metal bench. So no baby seat. But our baby enjoyed the nasi briyani. We all did
5
I am a huge fan of Roti Prata or Roti Canai, as they say in Penang. Nothing like a little curry early in the morning to get you going. I've had Roti Prata at Al Jilani Restaurant about half a dozen times now. The roti is consistently hot and light, and the curry has just the right amount of kick to it. Service is very quick & friendly, but don't expect a lot of chitchat. Best of all, it's a steal at two Singapore dollars. Of course, you're going to sit at a steel & plastic picnic table bolted to the sidewalk, but that's part of the charm.As a bonus, they are open all night. It works great if you've just arrived from an international flight and are waking up in the middle of the night. If you're like me and visit between 3:00-6:00 am, be prepared for the eclectic clientele that is so typically Singapore: post-clubbing local Hipsters, south Asia construction workers, thrifty seniors on their way to work, plus the occasional international tourist or backpacker. Even though I'm a bit of a demographic outlier, I've always felt welcomed and safe
5
This place is one of my must visit when i'm in Singapore. They serve delicious halal food with large portion. I suggest to split the menu if you have little stomach.I love the mutton briyani so much, although it opens 24 hour, the briyani rice isn't ready in the morning until 11 am, but the other menu is always available
4
A typical Singaporean roadside coffee house serving Malay/Indonesian and Indian food. Halal. We're regulars here, often turning up late on a friday evening after a drink elsewhere (no alcohol served here). Although we have also eaten here on other nights of the week. Always busy in the evenings. Staff are generally very customer oriented, despite no tipping allowed. Very reasonably priced, large portions of good quality food. We've tried a few menu items but keep coming back for the chicken biriani and the roti pratas. Both are served with a tasty curry gravy. We keep trying to find better roti pratas in Singapore and elsewhere in SE Asia, but Al Jilani's are still, in our opinion, consistently the best. Once, and only once (from probably nearing 100 visits) the pratas were not up to scratch. We asked for replacements. No problem. Tea tarik also reliably good. They are happy to serve iced water foc. We've been comfortable bringing various British/American visitors here, too, they are always impressed. 24hr opening is a real bonus. Have never known it to be closed, even on a Public Holiday. A real mixed bunch eat/drink here, which only adds to the appeal of the place... singles, couples, groups, families, all ages, locals, visitors from the nearby hotels..
3
It very convenient if you are staying at Ibis hotel. Good Halaal food.opens 24 hrs. Good road side area. It's cheap and has long menu. However it is open and doesn't have ac. Do Try the milkshake with plenty ice. You will enjoy this place provided you don't have very high expectations
4
I found this restaurant by accident, while I walked the bencooleen street to find 711.but then we're hungry, and we saw HALAL signs. so we decide to cross the street via zebra cross. and we met friendly waiter who can speak Indonesian very well.I highly recommended the pratas, seafood fried rice (and the other fried rice were delicious too), curry, mee goreng THAI. but I guaranteed that all food in here is delicious and also has big portion.I ate here 3 days in a row, til the waiter remember my face, hahathe owner is very nice too, I got some discount while I dinner. thankyouit's open from 6 PM til 4 AM, first you must find IBIS HOTEL (at your left), then you walk straight till you see traffic light, then you cross the street, that's the Al Jilani, it always crowd with people
4
Gotta pass by this every time we pass by the hotel. Food is nice and delicious and the staff there is friendly. The prata is nice :)
4
We passed this stall every walking back to BIG hotel whe we stay in. It only a step away from the hotel - conv store - al jilani. I like the food her. The taste is good. The staffs are nice and happy.
5
We stay at hotel big, and this restaurant just next to the hotel.
Price was good, and the staff was friendly.
The taste is very good.
4
I love eating here - convenient, cheap and fast. A place I can rely on if we are eating very late or after a late night drinking! Love their mushroom & cheese pratha with teh cino - yum yum yum!
1
So, we looked at the reviews of set off to satiate our hunger and boom what do we discover! List of disappointments. Firstly, this is a predominantly Malay food corner with some Chinese food thrown in. So, all those looking for Indian food, stay away! Secondly, this is a place open round the clock, so if you are dying with hunger at the middle of the night, with no alternatives, this could be your survival. Lastly, ambience is not of a restaurant but rather a road side cafe. We ordered Chicken Biryani, expecting it to be decent. Sadly, after eating couple of bites, had to leave it.
3
I am stayed in Hotel 81, near from this restaurant. They sell halal food as well. Most of their menu are Indian food, but there a any Indonesian and other halal food menu from other country. My first order was Roti Prata. Taste is good, but if you wanna order Roti Prata, make sure that you are ordered for a small size. Because the big size is enough for 2 person
5
Living in a part of the world where you do not get a great selection of Indian food, it is a delight to sample something like this. The owner was happy to explain all the various sauces, and we opted for the crispy chicken (curry seasoned), chapatis and chicken sauce. Was a delight, and went back for seconds. Spent a little more than we expected, but did demolish a feast
4
After looking online for eateries close to our Ibis Hotel Bencoolen, we found these very good reviews for Al Jilani Indian Halal café which we noted was open 24 hours daily. We decided to try it for evening meals on two occasions during our time in Singapore. It was so easy to find, being a couple of minutes walk from the hotel - turn left at the front doors, walk to the corner of Bencoolen and Middle Road - you will see the lights and outdoor seating area of Al Jilani across the road. It was always busy but we were seated quickly. The outdoor tables and chairs have the usual standard food court wipe down surfaces but we weren't there for expensive décor. The staff are efficient and helpful - there will be something for everyone from the menu. Please be aware that no alcohol is served or allowed here. We chose the mutton biryani with plain prata bread on the first evening. There was a little dish of extra curry sauce for each person. The meal was delicious and the serving very generous. It was spicy but not overpowering for anyone not used to authentic Indian food. The second time we went, we chose the chicken biryani and this time with mushroom prata. Again delicious. The total cost for each evening's meal was about S$16 for the two of us
5
We love Al Jilani. Great value for money and local ambience. We discovered this 3 years ago after we arrived at a nearby hotel (Ibis) after a late night flight and wanted something cheap and quick to eat. Al Jilani became a compulsory destination for my family on every subsequent Singapore stopover. It's always busy but we've never not managed to get a table...breakfast, lunch or dinner. Space magically appears. No Michelin stars here but who cares; the service is quick with large portions of no nonsense delicious food. If you're in the mood for some comfort food and don't care about calories try the fried chicken
3
Serving halal food (I think of Indian origin? or South-East Asian/Indian cuisine?), Al-Jilani was a good option for me especially since I was just staying at the Big Hotel which was just around the corner. It is a road-side restaurant, serving food that was quite tasty (at least for the dish I ordered) and I saw people eating there at all times of the day, and even late at night. I ordered a "Mutton Steak" which was different in appearance from the pictures that were posted on their sign board. It was chopped mutton mixed with potato wedge/fries, and a spicy sauce...which I felt was quite good! I must have gone there at a busy time because it took maybe 30 minutes for the food to come out, and all the servers were busy running back and forth and I had to try to catch my server so I could pay my bill. The place seemed a bit disorganized for me in that sense...but for the regulars it apparently seemed the process was--have a seat, wait for server who will eventually come to see you. Otherwise, the place was decently clean for a road side stall...if you don't mind the sound of the traffic or the sometimes oppressive heat
