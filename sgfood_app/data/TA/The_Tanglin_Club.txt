Not quite 4 but good nonetheless— good food, reasonable prices in a stodgy but pretty nice atmosphere

Tavern has a very nice British pub-like ambience with good food. Service was courteous and efficient. The menu selection has a good variety to choose from, which is helpful when coming in a large group.

Dined at the restaurant whilst visiting family in Singapore - open to members only and their guests.We ate in the Tavern - an oldy worldy British themed restaurant (bar type).Gentlemen's cut rib eye steak, liver and onion, Guinness lamb stew.Cherry confit, bread and butter pudding and a wonderful chocolate lava cake.Good salad bar, excellent staff.8/10

Last days stay in Singapore - where to have lunch before enjoying your last few Singapore slings at Raffles prior to departing to the airport> Answer - Tanglin Club. Excellent location and a perfect preserved reminder of bye-gone days. Traditional food and drinks in a relaxed and friendly atmosphere. Food selection is great - something that will suite everyone, excellent service and realistic pricing. Make sure when you visit Singapore you have affiliation arranged or know someone who can invite you into this excellent facility

This is a very good city club upholding tradition and charm, providing a good range of restaurants, has an excellent gym, swimming pool, theatre, Libraries for adults and children, and even indoor tennis courts. Their restaurants serve different food for various dietary and social connection level preferences. You can be as casual or formal as you like here, and there are spaces and dress codes appropriate for the respective areas. Our favourite foods include Laksa, Nasi Goreng with Satay, avocado and coffee dessert and fried rice with fish eggs and scallops from Tang Yun restaurant, and dishes from their menu of North Indian cuisine. A great place to be healthy and engage socially
4
Most conveniently located and elegance of old times. Reasonably priced variety of dining options.Members of clubs outside Singapore having reciprocal affiliations and travelling to Singapore for short durations either for business or for tourism will find this club a boon. One can also stay as the club has residential facilities

This review is for those we are considering staying here if you are visiting Singapore and your Club has reciprocal privileges. We stayed in a room in the Club house (vs sports complex) which was HUGE. The Room included $40 for food and drink ($20/person) and free minibar which is stocked with cold drinks, sprite, coke light and coke. They provided toothbrush. Toothpaste, and standard bath toiletries. Since we had 2 young kids with us we were limited in which restaurants we could use. The Roundhouse which serves bkft, lunch and dinner had a great menu of western, local and Asian cuisine. The staff was super friendly and helpful. It was a great way to start our visit in Singapore. There is a kids library as well as an adult one. A great pool and sports facilities. It was an easy walk to orchard and easy place for taxis. Would definitely stay there again

Great location in centre town near Orchard Road. Large premises allow for lots of activities and services, many more than the nearby American Club: tennis (indoor & outdoor), squash, pool, billiards, darts, movies, multiple dining facilities, rooms for members and overseas guests, etc. The quality of the food is, however, as mediocre, equal to a second-tier commercial restaurant. Outdated rules and dress codes - eg. no young children in many restaurants; must wear socks in the Churchill room; no open-toe footwear; etc. Fortunately, they have recently relaxed the enforcement of these rules. After all, this is not exactly an exclusive London club located on Pall Mall!
4
As a member of the Tanglin Club with a long waiting list to get in, it is certainly a throw back on interesting 'relics' of the British Raj ie, the "Tavern" with overtones of a gentleman's English pub cum white starched table cloths for international lunch or dinner. Functions at the Churchill Room carries over the tone set by the name of the room itself. Lots of amenities including a classy Chinese restaurant, a large area for members in an informal sports bar self service bridge room & watch indoor tennis or get a chance to play squash/out doors tennis, swim in the Olympic size pool and children's area; the list goes on. So if you are ever invited in as a guest or get booked into one of the 27 well appointed suites - it certainly is something to talk about if you are visiting Singapore
4
I am not sure if I should comment on the Tanglin Club as this is a membership club and I was invited to a large party, however I decided to comment on Churchill Room as the experience at the restaurant was fantastic. Excellent ambience, professional staff and very good food. Surprisingly roast beef was much better than expected (equal to top class quality in London)
5
Dinner with family and friends.Homely club atmosphere with many restaurants and bars to eat and drink.Good food.Nice architecture.
5
A very nice restaurant.
Great menu, great wines and excellent service.
A must go to while in Singapore.
In the evening the place is pretty hip.
5
It's very old club with well maintained building . We went here on an invitation by a friend who is members here . Enjoyed awesome Indian food here . Just too good beyond expectations . Not to miss coconut water , cheese parantha .
4
Love their laksa. Very nice and authentic.
Prices are also ok because they charge at a private club price.
Recommended.

It is important to state that this is a Club, not a public venue. I have been privileged to have access thanks to my membership of a British Club which enjoys a reciprocal relationship, so I am grateful to the members and staff for putting up with us.This is a very well run organisation. The swimming pool is terrific and is supported by a small play area and pool for little people. My eldest granddaughter absolutely loves the play room, where she spent hours playing with Lego.And the food is absolutely up to standard, with excellent service. Thank you the Tanglin Clu

We were guests at The Tanglin Club, and we loved the experience. The Guest Rooms are all one could wish for. The Rooms are modern and fully equipped, with Smart TV, Comfortable workspace, USB Wall Sockets for Charging, an extremely comfortable bed. There is plenty of storage space throughout the room. The shower en-suite is also great, with his and hers sinks, an extremely large mirror and a very comfortable dual-head shower. The cleanliness across the club is incredible, and house-keeping is top notch.What we didn't appreciate is that we were not provided the necessary information, rules and regulations before hand. We were visiting with our daughter who is just 18 months old, and from 6 dining places on site, 4 off them do not allow children. We were not informed about this. We were also not informed which restaurants are open on which days, and so we had a very bad experience with trying to dine here on a number of occasions. The Charge when paying by Card also was not appreciated. The food in the restaurants we tried was always really good. Service tends to be hasty close to closing hours
5
The Tanglin Club has lovely food in The Tavern which is jolly and has a bar and the coffee lounge both on the ground floor and the grand pricey restaurant called The Churchill also on the ground floor delivers great food for special occasions but is too big to be cosy. Tang Yun the Chinese restaurant upstairs is just right. The decor is perfect. Flowing lines on the ceiling. Whites and colours. Cloth and napkins. Not too noisy.Nuts on the table whilst we are waiting to order. Water comes up straight away, fast.Every dish a delight. Reasonably priced sparkling wine. However, nowhere in the building has yet got a sweet dessert wine because they claim there's no call for it. I can't understand why a place this size with four restaurants can't manage what almost any pub and restaurant in the UK can provide in terms of range of drinks. What else is missing? The sweetmeat such as a chocolate at the end of the meal. Toilets are elegant
5
This is a private club, but it's in the heart of Singapore, and has all the services of a good hotel - lovely rooms - but with the advantage of amazing value in terms of restaurants and sports facilities. As it's a club, the pool is brilliant, there are squash and tennis courts, and even a theatre which shows films. There is a strict dress code, but nothing too onerous. BUT you have to be booked in by a member, so it's very exclusive and hard to book
5
Open to club members and guests, the Tanglin club is steeped in tradition but moving into the 21st century with modern and comfortable hotel rooms, Cantonese restaurant, poolside restaurant, bars and of course the Churchill fine dining room.Kids are relatively welcome and the club has nice outdoor play and poolside areas for the kids to spend time. The pool is salt water and superb for swimming. On weekends the underground cinema opens up for screening of recent run movies. If you know a member or you have reciprocal rights its worth the bucks to stay at the Tanglin club for some well earned R+R when next you have the chance.
5
There are several dining venues at The Tanglin Club but this relates to our experience at Tang Yun restaurant. We spent two nights at the club as reciprocal members after disembarking our cruise in Singapore. The hotel accommodations were quite nice, well cared for and spotless and the rooms very large though the furnishings somewhat dated and lighting level was quite low compared to a deluxe accommodation. Brighter lighting would have made for a better stay. In addition, a room key card inserted into a slot near the entry door was required to activate the lights and air conditioning. Reverting to our old tricks, I placed a forgotten to return hotel key card in the slot and was amazed to find it didn't work as the lighting card receptacle apparently was computerized to read only the Tanglin key card rather than being a simple pressure switch. Well this meant my wife and I had only one key card between us as Singapore without air conditioning can be quite unpleasant.But as for the Tang Yun, wow what a meal? The hot and sour soup (which I didn't know was Cantonese) was easily the best any of four diners had ever experienced. Three diners had it with seafood, but I opted for the non sea food version. Abalone, a great treat. Soft vegetarian noodles unbelievably scrumptious. The duck beyond compare and the list goes on.Over the years we have dined on a lot of Chinese cooking, varying from Sunday take-out to family style banquets in China and gourmet restaurants in Beijing, but this meal ranked with the best we have ever eaten. And the service was correct and perfect
4
We had a family gathering at the Wheelhouse Restaurant, Tanglin Club. We ordered heaps of dishes including Nonya food. Everybody was happy with the food as it was delicious. We will certainly be back for more.
4
It is very pleasant at The Tanglin Club. Good rooms. Good for Children. Good service. Good food. Great pool, and a nice playground! The pool is just a little dirty, but excellent!
3
Avoid the paella in the wheelhouse restaurant, Tasteless, dry and lukewarm. The crabmeat was particularly disappointing and tasted like old soap left to dry in the sun. And it took nearly an hour to appear - the last 30 minutes doubtless spent 'resting' in the kitchen.The wasabi prawns were excellent as was the Berenger Chardonnay
5
This is the heart of gentile Singapore society. Lots of dark wood paneling and quiet attention by the staff. An introduction as a guest or membership of a reciprocal club is required for entry, but is well worth it. We had the full afternoon tea, which was delicious. My only small gripe was that I like orange slice in my Earl Grey, but was told they could only provide lemon??
3
Visited the club daily on our two week holiday to Singapore. We had family staying at the club, but we decided the accommodation was too highly priced. We obtained reciprocal membership through the scots club. My father in law and family have been visiting the club for over 60yrs. I found it to be very nice, old school. A lot of rules about dress etc in certain areas but by the pool and poolside restaurant it was fine. The price though was far above the standard of the service, there were a couple of very good waiting staff who were in charge but the majority were rushed off their feet and not great. The food was average/good standard (at the pool) overall I liked the place I just can't give it a higher than average rating because it is so expensive, 5 star prices with 3-4 star service. This place could be a real 5 star with not too much work
3
Had a business lunch there and since the place has the atmosphere of a grand colonial hangover, I'd expected better service than what was delivered. Forget the small error of delivering the wrong dish (though they had the table placement "map" on a side table), the food was nothing to rave about. In fact, the paella was way off standards. The colour of it was a dead giveaway and hint: it was not squid ink paella. And the lingering aftertaste made me suspect the kitchen crew or chef had not bothered doing much of the cleansing work needed for the seafood. Enough said, disappointment with what has been a classic
5
I love the Tanglin Club! It is very fun as they have loads of good activities. For kids and adults. They have a pool, with a kid pool To and has lots of slides and areas they can play! The Staff are usually very kind and friendly and overall a fun day at the Tanglin Club! Although, you have to pay a LOT to be a member or guest. It is rivarly with the British Club in Singapore, which is very popular! Also it is related to the Hurligham Club back in London, which I am a member there
4
This place is indeed very prim and proper as they pay special attention to your dressing. Certain areas are dress code sensitive.The food served here is great and the standards have been consistent throughout the years.I had the opportunity to have high tea in the afternoon with a friend and I still enjoy the ambience of the place
1
The Tanglin Club should be absolutely embarrassed by the terrible service, shocking food quality and cost of guest parking at this so called exclusive club. As a member of clubs in many countries I would be embarrassed to take guests to this club. The food is disgraceful. The toilets are dirty and when I saw a restaurant person leave the toilets without washing their hands I was shocked. To park in that guest parking station on a Sunday for 3hrs cost $13.50 which is more expensive then Orchard Rd and is just a clear cash grab. Anyway all I can say is I am glad I don't pay the amount of money they want each month for the privilege of being treated rudely by poorly qualified waiters in a poorly run organisation serving sub standard food. That club is surviving on its past glory and needs a complete revamp of people and facilities
5
If you are lucky enough to be a member of a club with reciprocal arrangements with this club then you really must pay a visit for lunch, or dinner, or afternoon tea, or drinks at the bars! I recommend the Tavern which is both a pub and dining room done up in old English style. But there is an outdoor terrace and an expensive posh dining room - the Churchill Room as well, plus a more casual eatery beside the pool. Great British grub here! - Kate & Sidney, Shepherds' Pie, 2 kinds of Fish 'n Chips with 2 kinds of batter!Not to be missed if you are visiting Singapore!Tip - bring your letter of introduction from your club, your club membership card, passport, Singapore Immigration Disembarkation Card, on your first visit to the Tanglin Club and get a little temporary Reciprocal Member's card for use at all their outlets
5
Nice place to stay. Ice big rooms. Great restaurants. Excellent service. Lots of atmosphere, of Colonial Singapore.
4
The Peranakan and Western foods were gorgeous. But the place was pretty busy and noisy since it was a family restaurant. After all it was a lovely lunch.
4
We were invited to this private club for our school reunion and judging from what we saw, it is a beautiful building with good restaurants and wealthy members. The concierge was fierce, telling a female member walking and talking on her mobile phone in no uncertain terms that use of mobile phones was not allowed. Yay, finally a place in Singapore where people cannot be frighteningly glued to their devices. Food was good, but this is to be expected in this marvellously foodie country. The club has a deep colonial history, is in the centre of town, and was where we as children would come to swim with our member friends (we were members of other clubs - Dutch, Swiss etc). It was fun to be back.
5
As this is a members club you are not able to just rock up but should you be a member of a reciprocal club or have friends in singapore that are members then I would suggest a visit here. The pool is great and he food at the tavern is really good value and decent. It also has one of the very few (if only) indoor tennis courts in singapore. If you are planning on staying in the guest rooms they are very good value with full use of the facilities and complimentary breakfast.
4
I just finished my lunch with my Singaporean associate at the newly opened Chinese restaurant at the first floor of this 125 year old club in Singapore. This signature restaurant serves traditional Chinese food. We had roasted duck with palm sauce, steamed fish with ginger and soya sauce and steamed rice. Food was well cooked and tasty. Decor of the place is modern but true to tradition. The Sauvignon Blanc we ordered was nice dry New Zealand wine. Post lunch we went to Tavern Bar cum restaurant at the ground floor where we ordered some crape with vanilla ice cream and coffee. I visit this club with my host every time I come to Singapore. Unfortunately, this facility is not open to general public and you need to have a member of this club who only can bring you here.
4
151 years old club. went their for a dinner in charchill room. there is also bar facility. very professional service. we have tried the special set menu of S$ 68. The quantity of food (main dish) is very small.however, enjoyed the evening and had a wonderful dinner
1
I have been going here for over 30 years and arranged reciprocal membership on a recent Singapore however, due to an administrative error, I was not allowed in for lunch with my sister and our 82 year old father visiting from Australia. The front desk were unhelpful, intransigent and verging on being outright rude when they could tell we were visiting from a far, and there was a genuine mix administrative mix up. Very disappointed as I have many happy memories of meals and family events at this Singapore institution but after my treatment on this occasion, I will not be attempting to go back on my next visit to Singapore
4
My late mom's family friends treated me to the above place for afternoon tea on two separate occasions. For the first time that we went, we were sitting at the corner. That was a rather busy Monday afternoon, thus it was rather noisy to talk. On the 2nd occasion, it was not that busy, thus we managed to sit and had a nice chat. We had the afternoon tea set, which was huge, with a variety of sandwich selections. We also had the apple pie, which was large and not too sweet luckily. We had the scorns and the curry puffs etc, for bringing back home to eat. In my view, these are best eaten hot then reheat them in the microwave oven. This is one of the best places to go for afternoon tea. The only downside is that you need a member to sign you into the club. We were each allowed servings of 2 different types of teas. Another disadvantage is that the table was too small, since we ordered a lot of food, so we ended up having to put the tea pot on the floor
1
Called the club on two occasions to clarify their dress code and reciprocal club arrangements. Was told that a letter of introduction was needed, passport required and club membership card too. On arrival we were mugged for the taxi by an elderly group prior to entering. On presentation of our credentials to the desk staff we were informed that entry was to be denied. Why - because both of us did not have the white departure card. Why was this, because one member is a resident through work and thus does NOT have the White departure card. We were told under no uncertain terms would entry be allowed and out club had be informed of the rules which they had now. All in all frightfully disappointing and this left a sour taste in the mouth. Singapore at its worst
4
Great location just off Scotts Road. Went with friends for lunch on Thursday. Beside a la carte, the day's special at Wheelhouse restaurant was Indian buffet.. wide range of salads, soup, curries, desserts . Food was tasty, and service excellent. Well recommended. However, you need a member to take you there
4
Very nice club in the heart of Singapore, walking distance from Orchard MRT, good food and nice surroundings. Expensive $9.60 for the cheapest pint.
5
My family has been members here for years! we have spent many a new year celebrating in the Churchill room! No matter what the occasion the TC always has a restaurant to fit! Superb service and food throughout the club!
1
Apparently Reciprocal Club members who are Singapore Residents are no longer welcome at Tanglin Club any more, since a rule change in October 2015. Very disappointing, as previous visits were excellent. Wont spend any time mourning Tanglin Club's loss, and happy to go elsewhere.
5
Wheelhouse serves authentic local food that you can find at the Hawker Centres (of course the variety isn't as great) - always a good choice.
4
Second visit as a reciprocal club member. A lovely, peaceful oasis close to Orchard MRT and many bus routes. There is a gorgeous and very large pool, several restaurants and the accommodation is spacious and well maintained. All the other things you would expect from this kind of club, including sports facilities.The main restaurant is the Churchill Room, where we had an excellent dinner, with good service. The Wheelhouse, by the pool, is where they “serve” breakfast. The choice is limited and I put serve in quotes because it was poor – slow and not a smile evident anywhere. In fact, this was true elsewhere in the facility, including the front desk. The front desk was efficient and helpful if asked, but are the staff trained to not smile? Our air conditioning wasn’t working when we arrived and when I asked the front desk if it could be fixed (it was 36C outside) they shrugged and suggested it was a hot day. She agreed to report it to maintenance, but noted that it was a Sunday. Nevertheless, a little later a cheerful maintenance man showed up and agreed there was a problem. He called in another engineer and they fixed it. This was the best service of the entire stay.Our last meal was in the tavern – excellent pub grub and friendly service.NOTE that the comments below relate only to food and, since we ate in trhee reataurants (hence "other", below), it was difficult to rate. I tried to rate collectively
3
Was refused entry to their main area for wearing a dark blue jeans. Well its their rules. So went to the more casual side. Their service staff was ODD. For a club, their service staff was no better than hawker center - hawker center style singlish. Could have been a bit more decent? Food wise - also not impressed. Had their bread-crusted prawns. Scallops for sharing looked like frozen scallops out of bag and tossed with some gravy and was good enough for 2 people. Sure it was CNY and busy time but that is the time when not to compromise on service and food quality
1
I have been visiting the Tanglin Club for over 20 years and have always found it to be a peaceful haven in a very busy city. It is not the most modern establishment or the most luxurious but it has all the required facilities plus a very large fitness and swimming facility.
5
As someone that grew up in Singapore this place is a Singapore institution. Every time I visit Singapore I make sure to stop by the Tanglin Club. The staff are wonderful and friendly and the service is great! Some may find the club to be old but it has a great colonial feel to it which I love! It is my home away from home
4
This is a well located anachronism of a place to stay. Wonderful welcoming staff, the room was superb, very quite and clean, very nice bed, great wifi. Wonderful,sports facilities. Remember that this is a members club, and they do have rules and standards,but this added to the stay, rather that spoiled it.The food was homely,with and they were very obliging . Great breakfast. Nice mixture of travellers and members. Very good for shopping centre and transit
3
Ordered the daily house steak. Probably 500g. 25% was burned and inedible. 25% was pure fat so had to shear off 50% leaving 50%. Side dish was the highlight of the meal. Tasty, fragrant and colourful. House red wine was acidic. Would return but not order same item.
4
The Tanglin Club is a great institution. My wife and I paid our second visit to the Tavern and Fireplace restaurant and bar and, as always, were welcomed with friendly staff. The food is straightforward and in no way pretentious. It is also sensibly priced, as you would expect from a club. Better still, they offer good wines at sensible prices. Sadly, you cannot book a table but we have not had a problem â€“ and you can always have a drink at the bar first. We love it
5
I love the Tangling Club. I cannot imagine any where better to stay in Singapore or any where else. The restaurants and bars are first class. The rooms are large and the views over the pool are lovely. The staff look after you so well, especially Mr Kuma on the front desk. I have had my best holidays here.
5
Well I didn't stay here but was there only for a meal. And I did sample many dishes - from malay curries to British fish and chips followed by some coffee! The food overall was excellent. It helps that I loved the ambience as well. Bit old school, colonial setting with seating that's both indoors as well as extended into a large balcony kind of an area. The service was crisp and polite. I would love to go back just for more food here but hey who knows maybe I stay here too the next time I am in singapore
4
This was our first time staying in the Tanglin Club. It is in a great position, near Orchard Road, and the swimming pool and its environs are absolutely fantastic. Our room was huge, compared to a normal hotel room. The bed was also wonderfully big and very comfortable indeed. We had dinner in the ChurchIll room on Sunday evening. The restaurant was quiet, but the food was very good. My impression is that the menus in the Tavern restaurant and poolside have become much shorter, and certainly several of my old favourites no longer appear. Service in the Churchill room was very competent, but poolside was a different story. It proved quite hard to attract the attention of passing waiting staff and almost impossible to get anyone to clear up dirty dishes, which remained sitting on the side tables for an inordinately long time
4
Had a pool view room which was comfortable for our family (two boys 10&8). Service is very helpful and there are various restaurant options, though there are restrictions to most for children (except Sundays). The pool is excellent and there is a nice poolside menu available. Close walk to the orchard MRT. I would stay here again, no doubt.
4
We stayed as reciprocal members for 5 days. We only ate in the poolside restaurant and, as others reviews note, it can get crowded and the service can be slow(ish) at peak times. However the food was always excellent, the staff very friendly, and the prices very reasonable. The location of the Club is good being only a 10 minute walk to Orchard Road and the MRT (metro) station.We would rate the Club as excellent and the poolside restaurant as very good
2
This Christmas trip we spent in Singapore and visited 3 clubs, the service at the Tanglin was the worse. Although two staff were courteous and helpful but the rest ignored our wavings. Chicken masala chicken vindaloo were delicious, but the service was below par. We are now enjoying breakfast at Singapore island country club the waiters waitresses so attentive that's why we want to write to tripadvisor about the appalling service in the tanglin.We waited for a long time for pots of hot water, there was a waiter chatting along with our next table (2 persons). He chose to ignore our waving, I waved at him, my son in law waved at him. When the pots of hot water came he didn't give it to us, he asked another waitress to give hot water to us. The club needs to train their staf
5
As a reciprocal member, we've stayed here many times over the years and would unreservedly recommend the club to anyone who is eligible. The facilities are generally excellent, the last upgrade to the rooms wasn't strictly needed but the results are excellent. All the dining facilities are good, the restaurant by the pool can get busy at lunchtimes. The club has managed to retain a bit of old colonial style mixed with the modern Singapore, not an easy task. If you were to stay at a hotel in the area, you would pay a huge amount more for such an establishment. There was a bit of an upheaval some months ago when some members of the committee resigned but it seems to have had no effect and the club runs as it always has done.Two tips, ask for a room overlooking the pool and always try 'The Meat From The Wagon' at dinner, you won't be disappointed
4
This is a famous and well-situated venue offering stylish surroundings and good food and drink. We enjoyed a light lunch by the pool and, though the standard of the food was high, the atmosphere slightly lacked the elegance and magic of the past. Staff were friendly but a touch off-hand. Notwithsatnding this minor criticism, it remains a privilege to experience a brief visit to the Tanglin Clu
4
This is well-patronized by members. The dining hall looks faintly Olde English, and is quite large. On a Tuesday evening it was just packed, and there was a constant turnover of tables.Our food was good, typical for a private club with a bit of everything, designed to satisfy an appetite rather than make a culinary statement.If a member should ever invite you, you'll have a good, hearty meal and friendly service
5
In the midst of Hustle and bustle of Singapore, The Tanglin Club is a unique place of elegant tranquility with various dining facilities to suit all good tastes. We had the priviledge of being hosted by a long-standing member.
5
The Tanglin Club is excellent. The food, the service and the facilities are all top notch. Definitely worth enquiring for a membership if you are there long term.
3
The food at the Tanglin Club is good in general, and if you stay here for a short period to enjoy the facilities etc.,it's comfortably enjoyable, BUT if you decide to join as a member or linger, be aware that this club has many rules and regulations and it can get quite unfriendly, as the members are generally old and grumpy.(literally)AND will have no qualms about calling security on you to enforce such petty rules such as having a collared shirt at the reading room.There is much politicking to be enjoyed as a member of this club, so if you desire to stay clear, look elsewhere to join as a member. There is a bald old time staff who goes around ensuring rules are followed are this gentleman should have been sacked long time ago, as he is rude and devisive
5
Our friends are members here and took us down for a swim and a meal. It is mainly frequented by ex pats but has a real feel of quality about it. The food was of a high standard, we enjoyed a curry for lunch. My type of place
5
A visit to the TC is like a trip back in time to colonial times. The club has great facilities and lots of food choices (the food at the American club next door is better though). You can spend all day lazing by the pool having drinks or at the gym. If you are visiting from a reciprocal club you can stay in the rooms which come with free breakfast. The service is generally good and the staff tend to work there for a long time. While it is a members club if you are visiting from overseas and are member of a reciprocal club you can use the facilities. As it is right in the heart of orchard road it's worth a visit.
5
The first point to make is that one has to be a member to be able to use this private members' club, or a member of a reciprocal club, or to be invited in as a guest. Members don't need any recommendation, so this review is aimed at those who are members of reciprocal clubs who can therefore use the Tanglin Club.As a matter of history, on my 21st birthday, visiting as a reciprocal member of the Malacca Club, I was thrown out of the Tanglin Club. It wasn't even my fault, but it was done very delicately indeed.It was over 30 years later that I next visited, to be told that the black list is only maintained for 6 months! All my recent visits have been as a member of my London club, but I wouldn't stay anywhere else in Singapore. From a club which was almost exclusively for Europeans in the 1960s, I have nothing but admiration for the way in which the Tanglin Club has evolved into a quietly confident, multi-racial club, across all the generations. It is well supported throughout the day by members of all ages and their families.It offers a range of dining facilities, from the formality of the Churchill Room through the English inspired Tavern Bar, the Terrace and the Wheelhouse. So there is plenty of choice, all of which we've always found to be of excellent quality and good value.The staff, some of whom have worked for the club for over 40 years, are delightful. Even after a 2 year gap one is greeted as an old friend.The accommodation is excellent, with large, well-equipped rooms and good free wifi. There is a sports complex on the other side of Steven Road, reached by a bridge.The Club is close to Orchard Road MRT, so it is easy to get to anywhere in Singapore.We regard ourselves as privileged to be able to stay here. We strongly recommend the club to anyone else with reciprocal rights to enable them to use it.I'm glad that TripAdvisor has now corrected the club's name
4
The club has a variety of food outlets. The Tavern offers good mix of cuisine in a british Tavern ambience. Overall a great place to entertain at reasonable prices. One can even have cigars and drinks at the bar area on the higher floor.Great for family fun as well with a great pool and great location
4
I wasn't planning on doing a review of the "Tanglin Club" but since I searched it and it was not even spelled correctly, and since my family have been members since the 60's I figured wth. With that said I do hope TripAdvisor will correct the name of club heh :)Anyhow, whether you're dining in the Tavern, Wheelhouse or Churchill Room, this is definitely the perfect retreat for folks who want to enjoy great food in a....errmmm more Colonial setting. I was fortunate enough to grow up using the facilities here since age 7 and still do when visiting my mum in SG. To this day I still enjoy all of the food at all 3 restaurants with my favourite still being the Tavern. Whether it is Prime Rib to a simple Mulligatawny Soup or even the lard & bread, or even local dishes, they have found a way to offer it in a completely acceptable & tasty way no matter where you are from or your background. Being mindful the dress code upstairs of course ;)Downstairs at the Wheelhouse is more easy going being poolside and all and I highly recommend the daily special if SG food is new to you as they do the fav's quite well for British club. With that said they do have a VERY nice Laksa in the Wheelhouse & Tavern and def worth trying, even coming from someone that prefers a Katong Laksa.Churchill Room, I've always spent holiday events and have always enjoyed every meal. Wish I had joined when living full time but opted for the less costly and slightly frowned upon "American Club", being an American and all.....but that's another story. In the end if you get invited to the Tanglin Club, sans the "g", don't hesitate and enjoy a bit of Colonial SG. Many, many happy memories over 35yrs at this place for me and kudos to them for keeping it right over all of this time.As for the last reviewer from Germany rating so low, I'm curious as to why as you certainly cannot expect streetfood quality from a British club, but I will say they are damn close on many of their local dishes. As for the Swiss Club, spare me, I lived down the street from them in the 70's, and while I cannot comment since then, I will say it's a nice environment as is all of Swiss Club Rd and I miss it dearly :

Although it might be right in the City centre, we were not amused by the Tanglin Club. It might be Nice during the Day. We only had Dinner there and it was by far the worst food we had on our 16 days trip trough Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and Singapore. Service was okay.If you have the possibility to enter another club in singapore, try the Swiss Club! It's bigger and right in the jungel and the food is amazing :

Just had lunch in the Terrace restaurant and I was blown away by the quality of the food, the service and the delightful staff. Ate here a few months ago and frankly it was pants but oh my how it's changed. Both the mutton rogan josh and butter chicken were top notch and the chicken rice excellent (though soup could have been hotter and bolder). The staff are v friendly and efficient. Can't recommend eating here enough.
