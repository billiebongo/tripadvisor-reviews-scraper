Had the mushroom udon, really fantastic. Mushrooms blended together with the broth, producing a rich and thick soup base and makes you want not want to stop slurping even though its so freaking piping hot.

I stumbled upon this busy little cafe after visiting the temple nearby. Really yummy vegan food and fruit juice cafe. The udon noodle is a must try. The broth is tasty, generously prepared with shitake mushrooms. Thumbs up! Definitely coming back again.

This place is small, busy and you may be sharing a table, but it is bright and impeccably clean. The "special udon soup" in a thick mushroom broth with vegetables such as broccoli and tomatoes and some sort of vegetarian sausage, is unbelievably delicious. It comes in a large bowl and you think you won't eat it all, but you will, and wish there were more. The juice combinations are very different, and the ones we had were very good as well. We were very sorry we only discovered this place on our last day in Singapore

Visited Fortune Centre to try Japanese Curry Express, but unfortunately they're closed on Sundays. Therefore headed back down to Tracy Juice Culture, where the "special udon" caught my eye when I first stepped into the mall.Slightly pricey at $7.80, but the portion was really generous. Quick glance at my neighbours and seems like many families choose to order 2 portions to share amongst 3, and ladies generally find it tough to finish a single portion. Only finished about 3/4 of my bowl though I was starving."Soup" of the udon is similar to a cream of mushroom with blended chunks of mushroom, and the noodles are served with pieces of mock meat, chinese mushrooms, broccoli and cherry tomatoes. The mock meat and mushrooms were slightly tough but made a good contrast to the softer udon noodles. The mushroom soup was really addictive. The day I visited, they only had udon and one other main course--mock braised meat rice. It's also $7.80. Heard that it's new on the menu, and looks like a really delicious bowl of rice, mock meat in braising sauce and a good mix of veges. On the 1st and 15th day of the lunar calendar, the place also serves Thunder Tea Rice, a Hakka traditional rice dish.Think the fruit juices here are organic. Best seller is their apple wheatgrass, which also contains pineapples. They really blend alot of fruit and wheatgrass to make one portion, so I guess the $5 is well worth it.While the main store area can only sit about 20 people, they also have some space at a nearby unit where diners can sit too

Thus place is a cosy shack in fortune centre.love the vegan soy brown rice and the thunder tea rice here. Heard the udon noodle soup is great too. Leaving it for the next visit. The searing is limited so getting a seating during lunch hours could take a while. But the staff are very warm and friendly. The juices here are superb. Must try. A good go to in fortune centre for All the vegans travelling to sg to get a taste of local vegan cuisine.

The porridge is very flavorful, with lots of grains and pumpkin. It is so nutritious and tasty. I love the mushroom udon and fragrant rice too and the portion is very filling and full with mushroom and vege. It's really a must try even for non-vegan like myself. Value for money for real ingredients used.Will visit again

The rich flavoured udon is the signature of this organic juice shop need no further intro. Today I tried their new choice for lunch: veg minced (mocked) meat rice. The combination of brown rice with tofu, pickled Chinese mustard (梅菜) with mushroom, mocked minced meat and sliced seaweed with sesame, is amazingly appetizing and delicious. Chopped red chili will give more flavor to it! Highly recommended.

The place to go for a good vegetarian meal - the mushroom udon and thunder tea are fantastic!My younger daughter who doesn't always eats her greens just loves the mushroom udon here and can finish a big bowl of it on her own. The thunder tea is good too and so are the blended healthy mixed vegetable and fruit juices.The yammy lotus dessert which is frequently sold out is also my favorite!

I have tried their yummy lotus (Sgd 5.50) which is made of yam and sweet potato
