Really good thick cut sashimi that was fresh. Service was relatively prompt and view was spectacular. Yakiniku beef and pork were well done and aburi was decent. Maki could use more variety and would be great if dessert was included.
4
The thick cut sashimi has always been a favourite and the reason why we would always think of Mitsuba for our sashimi fix - an affordable carte buffet.
3
Excellent food, value for money and good for gathering and someone who is Sashimi lover. Will revisit again.
5
I've been patronizing Mitsuba so many times and the food and service are still good. Though the soft shell crab hand roll is not appetizing, the rest are fabulous.
I will definitely go again and also recommend my friends.
Keep up the good work!!!
4
had the buffet and found it to be value for money. dishes were of reasonably good quality. would return.
5
Really worth the money,please make reservations before visiting. Staff are so helpful for reschedule as well,thx!
4
This was my second time visited mitsuba Japanese restaurant and had the same ala-carte buffet, convienience location and price still acceptable but if could include dessert in the price will be even more perfect.
4
You want something Japanese and with good selection, this is the place. It is located in The Central which is not really crowded and it has a good seating arrangement where you can even have huge parties of 10. Enjoy the buffet and it comes with most of the things on the menu except the desert and they are all easily ordered and reordered with little limitation using the menu pads.The food taste good and if you are a fan of sashimi then this will be the great news for you, they have a wide selection including yellow tail, tuna and salmon
4
2nd time eating there. Sashimi very fresh but the cut was a bit too thick. Prawns tempura very yummy. I love the pidan tofu. However, this time it was a disappointment. The pidan was only a bit on top of the tofu! I have ordered 3 times, all came the same. Overall, it was still a pleasant dinning experience. Service was good
4
The salmon sashimi was thick and fresh. Portion was good. Oysters were too big for our liking. The jap rice tasted hard and dry and we wonder what grade was it. The soba was nice . Chawanmushi was good . We were there to celebrate my sonâ€™s birthday. I calledTo check if they are able to arrange a slice of cake on the house. They told me they do not have cake. But there are cakes on their menu. Obviously the restaurant is not very pleased to please the customers . Soba only has one flavor.
5
Best Japanese buffet with quality free flow of sashimi in town. Relatively consistent standard over the years. During weekends, the buffet is only 2 hours max but more than enough time to savour the food
4
If you are into fresh and thickly sliced sashimi highly recommend Mitsuba for their buffet. It's good !
5
Food came fast, good quality, good service. Very satisfied with the value of the buffet lunch with the promotion! Thanks!
4
Really nice fresh fish and a great sushi place perfect value for money ,first evening in Singapore really enjoyed it
4
Service standard is not as excellent as previous... Food and atmosphere are excellent, not much different... Room to grow...
3
Food spread was okay. Prawn tempura was not fresh on visit yesterday but we enjoyed the rest of the food.
4
2nd time going to d restaurant. Food was good. View was excellent. Service was excellent with attentive staff. We will be back for more.
4
Been to Mitsuba 3 times already and the food is consistently good. A great place to have decent Jap cuisine with friends.
5
Went to this restaurant for its premium buffet on 15/01/2018. The service was good as the staff served the order and cleared the plates promptly. Simple ordering via an easy to use tablet.The sashimi was great, thick slices and fresh. One of my favourite repeated orders.Unfortunately, I don't see any fruits in the buffet list and for its desserts, they were not included in the buffet items so if you do want those desserts, had to consider the additional cost.Other add on available at additional cost including wine and alcoholic beverages.Requested for a window seat and was glad that they had one, enjoyed our food together with the great river view of clarke quay and its ever changing lights. Overall, the staff was pleasant and atmosphere at the dinning place was good. Check out the photos I took.
3
Charging kids of height over 1.2m at adult price is day light robbing! Book window seats but was given a super dark n dim table! Very strangely all saba served at different ordering times are the grills portion. Service not very good. Variety also very limited. Under valued for $
4
The lunch promotion was really a money worth spending experience.
I would say 90% of the servings are of high quality.
The sashimi are exceedingly generous in portion and size.
A must go restaurant for Japanese cuisine lovers!
5
Place service and food are all excellent have visit many time with family and friend for lunch and dinner.
3
The food we had on 2 Jan didn’t seem very fresh across the board. 1-2 dishes were though. Service was alright, didn’t seem friendly. Found the experience to be just alright and a bit lacklustre
5
I’ve been here like 5 times, and each time it’s been a solid quality experience. The little bowls that the food come in are adorable and lovely. Ask for a seat by the window for some great views over the Singapore River!
4
Good was great & service would have been been Excellent if not for a Service Lapse as staff did not adhere to repeated request pertaining to payment!! Had to address this with staff & register displeasure.
5
Reservation was efficiently done. Food n service were prompt n excellent. Will go again. The portion was good.
4
ala carte buffet dinner... quite a spread of options... thick cut sashimi was good... got a complimentary scallop with mentaiko which were delicious and star of the night... service is prompt... more than enough time to have a good fill...
4
Best japanese buffet in town. Good value for the quality of food served. Great variety of sashimi, grilled food and much more.
4
Service is prompt and brought ordered food timely. Had a good fill within allocated time. Food is good too!
4
Mitsuba offers good value set lunches (they also offer an ala carte buffet, which I haven't tried). The sashimi is fresh, although the quality of the rice could be improved. There are nice private booths, but these are available for larger group sizes. The 2-seaters are too close to one another so be prepared for the next table to listen in to your conversation. Service was competent.
5
Enjoyed the thick cut sashimi, other dishes on the menu were as delicious! Especially loved the aburi salmon with and without mentaiko!
4
food is ok. thick sashimi slices. but little variety of food and drinks. convenient location. service still acceptable.
4
Have a good meal and experience there but you have to be there punctually. 1h50mins is your given meal duration.
5
Been there several times with friends and seldom dissatisfied as the menu is reasonably extensive for the price you pay.
Sashimi there depends on the day or Chef, sometimes it’s perfectly prepared, sometimes it’s too thiccc...
The tea soup is also a must try.
3
Not too bad a restaurant for a casual lunch. Food quality was ok, nothing great to shout about but decent for simple lunch.
Service was good, didn't take too long for our food to arrive.
4
The food are good, especially the sashimi, fresh with generously thick cutting per slice. will be even better if some of the sushi items can be ordered without the rice :p
5
Went there with a group of my colleagues, quiet, attentive waitress, good food. nice place after work.
5
Brought the parents for their anniversary. Ordering was seamless via ipad. Portion was well controlled so that food wastage was minimalised. Really love this place.
3
The only things that i do not like is that you will not know what you have ordered and whether have it been served.Restaurant is using tablet for ordering and once you send the ordered you lost track of what you have ordered and how many not served. Hope that there is a printout or page in the tablet which we are able to see pending order
5
Brought my husband to dine there for his birthday. Food was awesome, alot of varieties to choose. Service was fast and good. Overall experience is absolutely lovely. It was my 2nd time there and I will definitely go back soon! Price was really worthwhile as the Sashimi was super fresh and thick
5
sashimi slices were fresh and service was fast. they also serve hot dishes, which was freshly prepared
5
Good service but some of the dishes taste drop but fried dishes is nice because not oily... anyway is a very good value buffet.
5
Food was great, the salmon is always cut in thick slices. Service was fast and the staff were very helpful. This is my 2nd visit and I will definitely come back again!
4
Nice place to have great variety of Japanese food. Food was delicious, staff was prompt response.
Easy booking through Chope app.
3
food and atmosphere are not bad. service is still acceptable but serving of food becomes slower after 715pm.
5
Food is nice and fresh. The variety for Ala carte buffet had a wide range. It is recommended for family and friends gathering.
4
Food is great.
Price is good.
Just that is a couple dinner but abit too noisy with the noisy couple next to us.
4
We were there on a Wednesday evening (considered off-peak). We waited quite long for some of the buffet items (seemed like they had forgotten about it). However, the place wasn't crowded that night. We subsequently order shoju amd specifically asked the waitresses to warm it for us but they tried to dissuade us from drinking it warm (it's easier for them to serve it chilled than to slowly warm it up).Overall, food was of standard and we would definitely visit again. This was our 2nd time there as a group
3
Had the lunch buffet recently and would rate this average. Food was alright, nothing much to rave about. It’s a buffet so I wouldn’t expect superb quality. Sashimi was cut thickly and that was really nice. Staff were rather rowdy which interrupted the peace that I wanted to have while eating. Overall, ok but may not recommend.
2
We had the dinner buffet. Sashimi and sushi were good. Sashimi preferred since the fish slice on the sushi were smaller with too much rice. Grilled fish were good, fresh and well cooked. Recommend he sashimi, grilled fish, tempura. Chawanmushi not worth trying. The experience was spoilt by the bad service we received. There was no smile by the 3 service staff who covered our table at one point or another. Questions and requests were quickly brushed off. They looked like they couldn’t wait to get off work. Would we go back again? There are too many good restaurants in Singapore to risk going back to one with bad service.
4
Services was good. Space was a little too small especially the table. Location was convinent. I would recommend the buffet meal as it is really value for money.
5
The service is excellent, though the food is very normal. There are only 2 timeslots, 6pm or 8pm. My recommendation is dont be early. i had to wait outside for a good 30mins as i was early.
5
We had ala carte buffet. Serving quantity is small which is good as you can taste a bit of everything. Sashimi serving is generous and fresh. Food is serve fast upon ordering.
5
Went for weekend lunch buffet. Friendly staff, food is good. Nice ambience. Not crowded. 4 diners, but we only paid for 3 due to promotion maybe? I personally like their tuna sashimi and the soup that comes in a pot (it's refillable).
4
The ebi prawn mentaiko 1-for-1 set was not bad, but the salmon temaki was just amazing. Had to order 2 for myself!!!
5
My second time back here and I was lucky to get a view of the river again. Food was unbelievably fresh; sashimi was cut upon ordering, tempura fried to order and lots of complimentary dishes. Amazing price for unbeatable freshness.
4
We come to Mitsuba regularly for the decent value-for-money set-lunch. Service is good and the sashimi is fresh. We love the crepe dessert (from the a la carte menu; not part of the set-lunch), but I would give the chocolate lava cake a miss.
5
I went Mitsuba for lunch with 3 other friends. It was out first visit there. To our surprise, the service was good. The food was awesome! The sashimi was very fresh. The prawn tempura was very sweet. Will definitely go there again.
4
Mitsuba could do more with a wider food selection. Still pales in comparison to other ala carte buffet I have had in the area. Sashimi has since improved the last time I came here, which was in Feb. But the yellow tail sashimi had quite a visibly 鲜味. Not sure if it's normal.
4
Mitsuba Japanese Restaurant located at 6 Eu Tong Sen St #03-88 The Central. This is the home to the Authentic Japanese Cuisine for traditional to modern Japanese food. All dishes that we had are seasonal and prepared from the imported day’s catch. Good quality ingredients used, which you can really taste in the food. The meal filled me up effectively, and I left contented. Compared to other Japanese restaurants, this one has a far superior quality and better value for money. The service is personable, the food presentation and taste of the dishes impeccable. I will be back again soooon
5
Really enjoyed my time at Mitsuba. The food of quality was good. However felt that the service staff could smile more.
3
small restaurant with view on clark quay. Sushi are tasty but relatively easy expensive probably due to the location close to clark quay.
5
Restaurant no lt very big but ok .nice decor.food was fast and small plate.........................good value for money
4
Service staff are quick to attend to our needs, despite the crowd. A place where you can get decent sashimi.
4
Enjoyed gorging on the sashimi. Notably the thick slices of salmon. The hamachi and megajiki are good too.
4
The portions of the food is just right. The staff are attentive. There is 25% discount for lunch for every 4 persons so it is worth a try.
5
Food taste good and staff was fast. Quite a few dishes on the menu. However, menu doesn't really change often.
Also, prices have risen recently
4
we were greeted with a warm friendly welcome at the entrance by the service staff and were served with distinction!
5
It was an ala carte buffet, and so it was unlimited orders but the fish portions are quite small. There are Two seatings, 6pm and 8pm. We went at 6pm, but you areonly given up till 7.20pm to order. At 7.55 sharp they told us they needed the tables back. Appreciate that they informed us in advance, but the timing was truly a little short for a buffet.. the quality of food and efficiency of staff made up for it though
4
This restaurant is situated within The Central mall, however please note this mall is separated into 2sections. So this place is at the back building (near to the residency + office lifts area).I happened to pass by this place a few things but never take notice of this restaurant as the store visual display is extremely dark. But I am surprised by their friendly service and if you are sitting at the inner part of this place, you get the Singapore River View.I never tired their buffet, been there a couple of times for their lunch menu. Is extremely affordable and nice! There was once I was sitting by the bar table and I get to see how they handle their freshly delivered food from supplier, they were fast, hygiene and with care. Ease at mind when I am in taking my food coming from the kitchen :
5
This is one of my "comfort" place for social gathering and to fulfill my sashimi and spider sushi cravings.
4
Cheap Japanese buffet at The Central, Clark Quay. It was a mostly pleasant experience. And it's ala carte buffet so the warm food were served piping hot. Salmon sashimi started out not too fresh at 7pm but became much fresher at 7.30 pm.
4
The food served was of quality. The fried food unlike other restaurants serving buffet, it was Hot and cooked upon order.
3
Fresh and thick sashimi but not to my preference of a bite size. Teapot soup, Cha soba and even the soya sauce tasted bland
3
The food is nothing fantastic. The service is bad, forgot our order and when we asked about it, gave us excuses. We are totally ok if you just admit that you overlook it. Please try to improve on your services and your food quality.
4
I was there in May with 2 friends for our dinner. The restaurant website is a bit confusing and I find it a bit difficult to find the accurate information I need. The sashimi are fresh and thick sliced! The teapot soup was something new to me! I find it is refreshing and it helps to digest. The yakitori were grilled just nice. Will bring more friends to try it out again!
4
First time having a Jap buffet. I don't eat raw food, so I couldn't try the sashimi, my friends ate quite a bit of it but did mention the quality could have been fresher. The other dishes I tried, like the tempura, and the yakitori were all very delicious. Price is quite affordable actually
2
Apparently I went to Mitsuba quite a few times. This will be my last time visiting them. For the fifth times to this restaurant, the past four times are fantastic. But the fifth is disappointing. Food no longer fresh, the squid got weird smell and taste and we try to feedback to the staff. The poor staff told the chef and we can hear the chef shouting say is smell like that one (we went a few times we knew the taste)Even our favourite Teba (Grilled chicken midwing) taste weird. The oil they used has been reused a lot of times, the mid wing taste with fish smell.Very disappointed, It only take once to chase all your loyal customer away
5
Perched on third level in The Central @ Clarke Quay, Mitsuba offers authentic Japanese cuisine and buffet at affordable prices. Diners can pick and choose from the attractive buffet or a la carte menu that features over 130 and 200 dishes respectively.Â In term of the value it cost $36.90++(adult) / $23.90++ (child below 1.2m) which is affordable and very good in the ratings. The service is average, most of the staff are rushing to clear your plates and if you didn't make any reservation, the staff will not service your request. I understand especially the weekends the crowd can be huge, and the staff are serving the dishes. The atmosphere we will given is isolated and cosy. It will be nice to have a window seating which is facing to the boat Quay. Highly recommended to call for reservation a day before dining at this Japanese restaurant. Don't be surprised, the dishes are miniature, but are extremely hummy. =)
5
I had a change in number of diners and the receptionist was quick to adapt to my needs. Made the change and informed me it will not be a window table as a result. It was fine for me. Food came quick and quality was great! Enjoyed the sashimi so much as it was very fresh! Will be back again
5
The food was so fresh and nice.
Sashimi was thick and Juicy.
Service was spendid and fast.
The whole trip was just great and enjoyable.
Will definitely visit Mistuba again.
4
Mitsuba serves an alacarte buffet, which appears popular with the diners. We ordered from the extensive alacarte menu. Food was reasonable in terms of quality (freshness) and price. Only wish the tables are not so close to each other and spaced further apart.
5
Excellent sashimi cuts and generous servings. Fantastic place for a buffet lunch. The food is of good quality with very prompt service. Value for money. Highly recommended!
5
Second time visiting this restaurant, definitely a best choice for Japanese cuisine lover. The ala carte buffet is really worth the value, especially the thick and fresh sashimi and the food is serve very fast. By using Chope also make reservation much easier.
3
Seven thick and fresh sashimi.. value for money. Just one thing: why dessert not included? Good to include.
But that's OK..
5
No fantastic dishes but good enuff to stave away the crave for jap food! thick slices of fish and good tempura.
5
Super fresh sasimi and lots of choice to choose. Value for money. Go for lunch buy 3 get one free. Support
4
Enjoyed the dinner in general. Good ambience and quality food. Went on a weekend so it was a little rush due to their 2 hours seatings policy.
3
Came back after a long time. Seems like changed of management. Better food but the staff probably need some training to better handle customers. Wanted a cosy table for a private lunch but told they couldn't give because we were not 6 people. The restaurant wasn't pack. Sat at the table that looked more like a foodcourt set-up
4
Fresh Sashimi with 6 types including Hamachi & Mekajiki. Most ala-carte buffet may not offer so many options. Selections of menu is wide and in small portion allowing us to be able to try more dishes. Lunch has a 25% discount for every 4 pax. Good and fast service. Must try if you like ala-carte Japanese buffet
5
Excellent service and quality of food.. the sashimi was fresh and generously pieces... thick and juicy
3
It seems like the oil was reused many times and the Colour of the Fried Food was dark. Very disappointing.
4
Lunch spread was awesome with good variety.
Staff were attentive and helpful :)
I love how they always present us with complimentary of the day.
5
Nice atmosphere for gathering and the food serving just nice. Service is good too, constantly check and fill up our drink.
4
Good food at a great price. Did not skimp on quality. Service staff was prompt and friendly. Will come again.
4
The sashimi are very fresh and thick. The variety of food is good too. Service is very prompt. The servers are very polite as well.
4
I have been here several times with family & friends whenever we crave for sashimi, spider hand rolls, grilled fish, tempura & soba noodles. Imagine if I have to pay a la Carte for our favorites, I end up poorer. The service staff were attentive and friendly. Fresh & quality sashimi & seafood.
4
The sashimi was really fresh, though we had to remind the seevice staff before our order was served. But they are generally attentive, will clear plates and refill green tea. The grilled chicken was more tasty than during our last visit. The 4-for-3 lunch promotion was good value. Plan to visit again
4
We've decided to go for this restaurant to celebrate my hubby's birthday celebration as my recent visit was quite pleasant. Managed to get a good window seat per our request. Staff was attentive and serving was prompt. We even had complimentary scallops sashimi from the chef! Only downside was that there's a time restriction of 2 hrs for dinner during weekends so we had to rush through our orders to finish and go (the waitress got us to settle the bill). I think I'll rather go during the weekdays for my next visit
3
Mitsuba offers a alacarte buffet menu where you can select a variety of food from the menu. There is no limit to how much you can order but they will charge you extra if you waste too much food.The good:Waiter/waitresses were attentive and kind. If you are starving, I guess its a good deal for all you can eat (in terms of price).The bad:Food is not authentic like they have proclaimed and frankly, not great. Summary:- The food is subpar.- Buffet.- Wastage charges
4
Food and service was pleasant...... value for money as well. Selective is wide and the portion is small but just nice so that can try more food. Food is fresh as well.
5
Fresh sashimi cuts which leaves you with superb feelings after each bites. Great service and the food is served hot. Will definitely dine in again. Reservation is required.
4
Value for money Japanese buffet. We arrived slightly before 8 pm, the next seating for the buffet. Dessert was not included but reasonably priced for the quality. Will be back.
5
value for money buffet given the variety of sashimi meats. Variety of ala carte japanese dishes are aplenty, it is even much better than sakura and momichi
4
We like the thick-cut sashimi although selection is limited. The service is actually quite prompt and portion served is bite-size.
4
Restaurant has a great view overlooking the Singapore river. It serves a wide variety of good Japanese food.
3
The service was prompt and food is served in small servings which is good. The service staff are also very friendly and helpful. Good value for money. I will come back again.
4
Nice environment, great food selection.
Good service as staff were all smiley and very accommodating
4
Booked a table for 8 for a Sunday lunch. The promo of 25% off for every 4 diners was quite worth it since it essentially means 1 dine for free with every 3 paying adults. The food though was just average. Sashimi was cut inconsistently, some slices were very thick while some were thin. Prawn tempura was a disappointment too - the prawn was overcooked and did not have the springy texture. The other food were so-so.
4
Great spread and variety available. Food came quickly and it was in a small portion which meant that we were able to try more dishes. Sashimi was fresh and generous. Quality was good for most of the dishes. With the 25% discount (for every 4 paying adults), it ended up to be about $30 after GST which was really affordable in my opinion.
4
The buffet was very value for money and the variety was good with selection of raw food, grilled and cooked food for kids and adults. Overall, it's a good restaurant for family dining and gathering.
4
The service was very prompt and friendly. The dishes came in small, individual portion - absolutely perfect for finicky eaters who like a taste of everything. Overall, I thought the buffet price was a real steal. Great place to gather at with friends.
4
a good dinner experience @ mitsuba.
the ambience was a little noisy but food was good.
Overall a good dining experience.
4
Fresh sashimi. Value for money buffet. Nice view from window seats. Quite a variety for ala carte buffet. Reservation preferred.
5
Booked this restaurant for my fiance's birthday dinner and it sure didn't disappoint. The sashimi slices were thick and fresh. Portion for the other food items were tiny, but because it's buffet, it didn't really bother us.
3
Pretty standard Jap food. Set lunches are good value for money. They have buffet but didn't try. Crowded during lunch, so best to reserve. Acceptable service, waiter does come round regularly to top up tea.
2
Recommended restaurant. Told that 'a la carte buffet' (no, it doesn't really make sense) was good value. Went along on a Saturday lunchtime. Wish we hadn't.Service is friendly enough, but not particularly efficient, but it's the food that really disappoints. It's supposed to be a proper Japanese restaurant, and yet not one single dish would even have passed muster at a sushi train establishment - even the cheaper ones.Everyone knows that dishes never look as good as they are presented in the pictures provided, but Mitsuba really strains credibility in its offerings, that are so slapdash, and put together with so little care that, more often than not, they are almost unrecognisable. Sashimi was bog standard and not very fresh, and the cooked dishes bore more than a passing resemblance of having had a brief relationship with a microwave. Sure, they churn the food out fast, and you can eat as much as you like - so people with large appetites will probably find the experience decent value for money - but the quality of the food is embarrassingly poor.From the moment you enter the establishment you sense that something is not quite right. We witnessed 'chefs' paring vegetables next to an industrial dustbin; other 'chefs' unashamedly opening tins of food, and squeezing out sauces from bottles; dishcloths sitting about near food preparation areas; simply a total lack of care as to how the restaurant and the cooking process could be perceived by diners. The philosophy is obviously to get people in; feed them as much sub-standard food as they think they can eat; and get them the hell out of there, hopefully without noticing that no one involved in the restaurant could give a fig about quality control in any respect.A wonderful example of just how bad this place is: we ordered a pork katsu; it arrived cold. We sent it back. It arrived again (same dish!) having been 'nuked' - which meant that the accompanying sauce was now a veneer on the plate - totally dried out; completely inedible. That's the kind of care and attention you can expect, and complements the lack of respect this establishment accords to its food and its clientele.Oh, and the experience came to S$110 (with two beers - Asahi Black - very nice, but then they couldn't mess up opening a bottle) which is very poor value indeed. Never again
4
The ala carte buffet is worth a try, though it was full house on a Sunday afternoon, service was prompt and good. Food came within 10min for each order and the waitresses were quick to remove your used plates and refill the green tea. We were initially worried on long waiting times or being overly crowded but the ambience was well maintained and the lunch felt orderly and smooth. Food wise, would have preferred more variety but quality was there and we left stuffed anyway. The complimentary mantaiki ebi was the best but unfortunately only 1 serving :
2
Besides the sashimi which was fresh, we thought most of the buffet items were not up to normal Japanese restaurant standards. Price was okay for a buffet, around $40 pax, but not for the quality of food. Very disappointing as this restaurant came recommended by a colleague
3
the food is decent and the sashimi is fresh. you get 1 complimentary mentaiko scallop per person as a starter. I really appreciate how you always get the cold foods before the hot foods even with repeated orders for the ala-carte buffet. the waiting time between orders do take a littler longer than expected and some of the dishes are served lukewarm. but for the price you pay. it's pretty worth it.
4
the food and service also very good. environment also not bad. Definitely will visit again. Thank you chope
3
Good for value lunchies and friendly service staff. We loved their jyo chirashi! Slurp! Will return for more.
4
Tasty and fresh food, staff are prompt with order request, we are served with complimentary dishes too.
2
Sashimi is good however prawn tempura and agedashi tofu stinks of re-used oil. Will not return on weekdays.
5
My family of 9 pax were at Mitsuba @central mall for dinner. It was entirely a different feeling....it's a buffet charged about $34 per pax after a15% discount (including gst/service) . Eat as much as you can within 2hrs. Food served to you as you place the order.The food range were good and quality excellent. Should try the garlic fried rice, unagi fried rice, mentaiko spaghetti, cold udon....extremely superb. We also tried the sashimi, chawanmushi, kani bacon, tsukune tori many many more...all dishes were fresh n very tasty with a difference. They also served us mentai scallops which comes as complimentary which was excellent. The staff were very efficient, quick and friendly. The chefs were also very friendly as they were at our table chatting... overall value for money and my family members really had a wonderful time. My hubby and my brother had a very interesting father's day with a cake cutting session after a delightful dinner
4
Belated father's day lunch with dad to skip the wkend madness.Was easy to book and overall good experience with Chope once again.Good view for a cosy restaurant.Sashimi, grilled mackerel, etc. decently priced and fair.Good and fresh. Just abit of wait at the end for bill because quite busy clearing out receipts.Would revisit again.Thumbs up
4
Was here for the first sitting for dinner. Went for the buffet ala carte. Service was good. We were waited on by attentive waitresses that were helpful in explaining the items in the menu. We ordered using the slips of paper given. However, we noticed that not all that we ordered were delivered. We had to reorder again. Wished the people at the kitchen were prompt in their cooking. The food was good. Nothing offensive. A few hits and misses. But good overall. Only negative comment was for the failure to deliver the food that we ordered. Overall the dining experience was good
3
Only 1st plate of Sashimi came fresh. The rest you can tell that they were kept for days. Variety is ok but you can definitely find better buffets out there with this price. Went for 1st sitting at 6pm, the whole unit is so warm with sun shining on you. Though curtains are down but I can hardly feel the aircon. The dyson fan is hardly working too. End up I was sweating while eating. Bad experience really
3
Was looking forward to trying after reading all the positive reviews online. The first -ve indication was how warm the restaurant was. Other than the sashimi and the spider maki which I tried, everything else was just average or below. Anything fried or grilled was overdone and hard. Nothing to shout about
4
There were too many people reserving this restaurant. We booked the table at 6pm and was forced to leave exactly at 7:55pm, because they had to clear up for the next batch. The amount of time we had was not enough for a gathering especially for a birthday celebration. Attitude from the people working was very good, plus points for that (esp the waiter who had to play the bad guy role to shoo us away). Food was not too bad, good for value. However we just felt that time given to us was too short. I would still come back for more, and will recommend this to my friends and family. Please remember to make a reservation before dropping by as you will be very disappointed (full house sign ahead).

Satisfied with the varieties of food, cleanliness of the restaurant and great services from the staff.
However, sashimi can be sliced into thinner pieces.
5
the location is good. nice view of clarke quay when we seated at window seat. Good variety of japanese food. Waitress is prompt in clearing plates. Will go again.

The fresh sashimi was delicious and came in thick slices. The teapot soup wasn't as tasty as compared to previous visit.

We were there for the ala carte buffet. Food was yummy, portions nicely small so one can try many dishes. But the manual paper slip based ordering system was a nightmare. Half the time the dishes we ordered would not come, and someone else's orders will arrive instead. Sometimes dishes will arrive so long after it's been ordered, sometimes they never arrive at all. When we tried to check what's pending, they can only tell us how many more items are outstanding but not which. We received a complimentary hamachi Kama shio as apology for the long wait and mess. But still left without getting full after almost 3 hours

The buffet style is allowing repeated orders of menu item, so you don't get to walk around to pick your food. The food is ordered and served to you without long waiting time and even though the restaurant is full-housed. I ordered the multiple fish Sashimi repeatedly for 3 times and every-time the dish is fresh, there are 5 types of fish with this Sashimi dish, compared to some restaurants offering only 3.Variety of food was little, no seared Sushi or 'Men-tai', need to pay more for sea urchin. With the price of more than $30 per head I would expect more variety and inclusive of sea urchin. Took a long time to serve dish with Mushroom and had to be reminded, albeit the staff bothered to check which specific dish was not yet served and served everything ordered finally. Worthy to note is that the menu offered good spread of appetizers, such as sliced tomatoes in japanese teriyaki sauce and fried tofu. Albeit appetizers came only after the main dishes have been served, which logically should be vice versa.But this place is definitely better than some big branded restaurant in Singapore in terms of price and quality of food. They are able to provide fresh Sashimi despite late into the opening hours (I came at 8pm, though the restaurant have been open since 6pm).The restaurant need to improve in their reception service: I came 15 minutes before my reservation time of 8pm but was told I can only get my seat on the dot. The restaurant had bothered to call me earlier to confirm my reservation then why not advise me to come on time as they will not serve me earlier. Albeit I still graded the service as V. good because the restaurant staff had bothered to come to me to check all my orders to ensure everything ordered was served. Hot/cold green tea available with free flow and refilled without having to be reminde

Read several reviews that service is slow at Mitsuba hence we submitted 2 tickets at once for our first order. Food actually came faster than we expected and service was good - service crew was attentive, took our orders and refilled our glasses promptly. Food choices were extensive and good for the price of the buffet. Recommendation: Sashimi Moriawase, Spider (Soft Shell Crab handroll), Bifu Enoki Maki. Do not recommend fresh mushroom in butter sauce unless you are a super butter fan

After reading rave review of the restaurant, decided to have a couple birthday celebration there with my hubby.However, we were both very disappointed with the food quality and the service level. We have ordered 10 dishes for the first round. Only about 7 dishes came. The 2nd round ordering, about 7 dishes came again.The food serving are slow. We ordered the chawamushi and they are bland in taste. Other dishes are either ok or too saltish.Will not be bac

mitsuba japanese restaurant complimentary scrallap lot for each customer. The sashimi is very fresh, deliciouswe need to order by writing the quality and number on a piece of paper and pass it to the waitress. Most of the waitress were not so friendly, we placed many orders but some were missing, we have to re-order againThe best is the sashimi, with this price i think its consider cheap. Overall is average.We reached there at 6.30pm, they served us very fast , but service turned slow after many guests came in.. Long waiting time Suggest go earl

I don't usually write reviews but honestly I was extremely disappointed with Mitsuba yesterday evening. We had a reservation for 6.30pm and we chose to go a-la-carte. Our food took their time coming out but my 4 other friends and I didn't make too much of a fuss. However, at 7.30pm, a waitress came telling us that they were taking our last order and to be out by 8pm. This, as far as we know is only applicable to their buffet customers. Anyway, we orders a couple more dishes and while waiting, another waitress came to inform us that we could stay as long as we wanted to as we hadn't opted for their buffet. At 8pm, our orders had yet to come and when they finally did, as soon as we had finished eating, the first waitress came telling us that we were supposed to be out at 8pm and we had overshot the time. We explained to her what her colleague had told us and that our food hadn't even come by 8pm so how were we to leave?! She insisted she was right anyhow and we just told her we were already paying and going so let's not make a fuss. As we left, we realised how many empty tables were still available which begs the question as to why we were being rushed out. As for the food, the sashimi was nice and thick although not necessarily the freshest. Their cod mentaiki was a little on the fishy side and the chicken teriyaki tasted of refrigerated chicken (if you leave cooked chicken overnight in the fridge you'll get what I mean). Honestly, average food we can deal with but service staff giving us conflicting information and not checking on our orders even after multiple enquiries is a total deal-breaker

Fresh sashimi and unstoppable shishamo. Service lacked a little when the lunch crowd became larger. Friendly staff responsive to requests.

Highly recommended, very good quality and fresh ingredient, love this place! This is my favorite place for Japanese sashimi and unagi rice!!

Love the food. Love the strive. But need to reserve your seat in order not to miss out the great food..

ok the one at mira hotel is better
it has ok choices of food
the other one is cheaper and a lot more variety
a lot more japanese feel

The sashimi was not very fresh which was disappointing. The other food was also only mediocre. Lastly, the service was not very good. They did not bother to let us know when the dishes ran out

I tried the dinner buffet. Sashimi was average but cooked food were all quite poorly done, ebi mayo was slathered over a lot of items. Yakiniku was extremely oily, inedible. Yakitori meat was not marinated, just covered with sauce. Perhaps ala carte food would be better. Ikoi has higher quality buffet for similar price. Restaurant aircon was weak so fans were placed here and there, which blew the order chits and wet towel wrappers on to the floo

Had a family dinner and found the place upon chancing around the area. We had 7 persons and decided to go for the buffet instead of the a la carte . At 36 $ s per head and being a Saturday. We had 15 percent discount . The food was ordered from the menu and prepared straightaway , the service was acceptable even though the place was crowded . The sashimi was nice and delightful , had many variations, all enjoyed ourselves and the bill came to $265. Very reasonable thus recommended .

The management and staff extended their warm hospitality to our group reservation. The duty restaurant manager, John, patiently attended to our request and our group did not have to wait long for the cooked food compared to what was previously rated by others on the waiting time for the food. Our reservation was for 1130am so perhaps the pre-peak lunch period was a plus point

Dinner for 2. Making reservation was easy online or by phone. Call back by restaurant to confirm attendance. Upon arrival, very quickly led to table. A la carte buffet at SGD39 ++ each. Pencilled our orders on an order script -table number, number of diners, items, quantity. Gave to staff. Food came in quick succession. No fuss. Food was decent. Sashimi was fresh. Service was minimal but sufficient. No dessert in buffet
4
We had the ala carte buffet. The buffet is value for money especially the cuts of the sashimi are quite thick. The other food are quite good too. Only complain is the service is rather slow. Certain items which we ordered during the first order came only after one hour. Please be prepared to spend longer time there.

Food is not bad and the service was attentive. Would wish that the air conditioning was stronger....
5
Everything was of high standards. There was excellent service, atmosphere and more importantly, food. This is one of the best.

Good price where u can eat until you drop for their buffet. Go during weekday mon- thurs for discount.
2
There's a lot of food varieties but the quality wasn't great and nice. Won't go back for a 2nd time visit.

Had lunch for the 1st time there and ordered the beef set. Too much fat with the beef. Threw most of our food. The set comes with rice, soup, a little octopus appetiser and fruits. Friendly staff though.

I went to this place to fulfill my daughter's wish to have birthday party in a traditional japanese restaurant. The place is not really traditional, but lots of good recommendation can be found at hungrygowhere and chope. I finally booked the place through groupon.sg, and got $60 voucher with only $30 cash. My daughter found that they are giving a sets of desert for birthday celebration (i.e. ice cream with chocolate lava cake). It was a pleasant surprise, given that we are already using groupon discount.We ordered the Sake Don (Salmon with sushi rice in a bowl), it was really good, and the salmon slices are thick and fatty. The tempura is also quite good with savoury sauces that came with it.They have bottomless hot green tea, and generous wasabi servings.There is nothing special with the customer service, but the food is quite good with the price it offers
3
Its a japanese la carte buffet so the quantity is there, however quality wise there's lots to be improved. Overcooked meat dishes were especially troubling regardless of meat, chicken,pork or beef were all consistently overdone. Additionally the tempura batter was rather heavy. Pretty much a deep fried prawn. Sashimi was overall the tastiest option. If you're craving for a japanese feast this may suffice but for the price you're better off with a bento at Hinoki

We enjoyed the astonishingly good value a la carte buffet (only $37 each). Many dishes were great - sashimi moriawase; sushi and grilled sanma. However, a few dishes were not so good - the tonkatsu was very thin and dry; the tempura moriawase was rather soggy. Nevertheless, for an affordable buffet of basic and traditional Japanese food, it was good for our little group

Went to Mitsuba for lunch at about 2:20pm. We saw the sign that says the restaurant for be closed from 3pm onwards. After we sat down, I confirmed with the staff that last order was 3pm, and she said yes.We proceeded to order our meal.As we were having our meal, the staff keep comping over to our table to check if we had finished. Once, one of the staff even wanted to clear a dish which I've not finished. I have to stop her from taking it away.Just as we finished our meal, the bill was presented without us asking.I had warm water during the meal, and I asked for a top up, but the staff said they had no more warm water as it was almost 3pm.We didn't enjoy myself at all during the whole meal.(Rcpt#:A15000007322

I heard of this restaurant at Central and I came to try the food here recently. Its located on the third floor of the mall, near the escalator that brings shoppers from the ground floor to the third floor directly.We started the meal with a bottle of Kubota Manju Sake. This is my favourite sake, which is smooth to taste and easy to drink.Here are the highlights of my meal:- Pitan Tofu: This was a petite serving, but it was good. The century egg sauce was smooth and creamy. - Mentaiko Scallops: These were Hokkaido Scallops (with shell on) topped with a generous serving of mentaiko cream and grilled. I scooped up every bit of the mentaiko cream. - Mentaiko fresh Japanese Prawns: Prawns done the same way as above. Prawns were meaty and fresh. Nice.- Sashimi Moriwase: There was 6 types of sashimi and its good for 3 pax. Standouts were the fresh Hokkaido scallops which were soft and tasty. The salmon belly was also good. - Beef Nabe: This was the hotpot with beef slices. Its served with an assortment of vegetables, rice, Japanese pickles and an raw egg dip. The soup will come to a boil, and you take the beef out to dip into the beaten raw egg dip to ‘cool’ the beef slice down before eating it. This can be shared by two people and you can then order more stuff to eat!- Shake Aburi Maki: Salmon wrapped crab stick rice roll. The salmon is flame broiled before serving and I loved the nice fatty flavour when I bite into it. I ate 3 pieces of this. - Oyster shooter with a raw quail egg: A shucked fresh oyster placed in a shooter glass with a raw quail egg and soy sauce. swig it back and the oyster is so smooth and plump. Egg complemented the dish well.- Steamed Hokkaido Horsehair Crab: This is a seafood delicacy from Hokkaido that’s popular here. Its cooked to order and served warm to the table. You break the legs and cut it up with the unique scissors that has a long and short blades. The legs are not so tasty while the body is more meaty and the parts with the crab roe were the tastiest. This was served with a ponzu dip and spicy daikon that has a hint of chilli padi. Packs a punch. Nice!- Sardine tatami and Fugu bak kwa: Grilled Sardine tatami and Fugu bak kwa. Loved it, especially when eating it with the Japanese mayonnaise on the side.- Soft shell crab: Nicely fried. Crispy and tasty. Paired well with the mayonnaise. I could eat this all by myself.- Spider Hand roll: I had this after the earlier dish. Satisfied my craving for the soft shell crab.- Asari clam in miso soup: Ended my meal (food-wise) with this soup. The clams imparted a sweetness to the soup, which had seaweed, tofu and miso in it. A nice end.We also had a sparkling yuzu sake, that’s bubbly and easy to drink. The ladies in my group loved it. The restaurant has a good range of drinks (sake, soju, whisky, beer) that will cater to most people. I will be back again
