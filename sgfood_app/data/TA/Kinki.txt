Very good food and ambience. Located overlooking the water. Excellent views. Food was very good but pricey, with lunchbox starting at $40.
5
Fresh fresh fresh Japanese cuisine. Extensive menu and decent drinks list. We did this on our first night and it was a great introduction to the quality of food we were in for. Super fresh and super tasty. We sat at the bar and washed the chefs delicately prepare everything to order. Well worth a visit and make sure to order one of their martini's

We were tired after a flight and just wanted to be fed. Jerry, the manager on duty, was very accommodating and welcoming. The menu has many great dishes but surprisingly limited gluten free and vegetable options. I have given an average rating because it wasn't 'very good'. The lack of options for those with gluten sensitivities and for those who don't eat land living meats was limited.However the location is prime with great views and the service was friendly and accommodating. However can't say the prices were justified.If you do dine here, make sure you book in advance to secure the tables by the window

Yes, the view is great across to the Marina Bay Sands, however the food fell well short of expectations, especially when you consider how expensive each small dish is and the number of dishes required to satisfy four people's appetites.Unfortunately the tempura vegetable dish we ordered had a hair in it. We called the manager over and pointed this out to him, as well as pointing out that the lamb cutlets were extremely fatty and clearly not great quality and the pork belly was substantially over cooked and was very dry. He seemed to lack any real empathy and his reaction seemed as though this might not be the first time he'd heard this. To his credit he deducted the three dishes from the bill and also gave us 10% off the remaining bill, however the damage had already been done and what was meant to be a great night out was a disappointment for everyone
5
Beautiful atmosphere, great service and a wide variety of food and drink choices to choose from on the menu. Reserved a table for 3 and brought a friend who was visiting Singapore there for a treat. She had an incredible experience. Not only was the view spectacular but the food was incredibly tasty and delightful. The music was very much like being in a Mexican restaurant. Thank you for a memorable experience.

Awesome sashimi, impressed that they have hirame which I don't see often. Lovely tofu with century egg . Teriyaki beef was good though portions a bit small.This restaurant n roof top bar has views to boast. Service pretty good . Go for their 1-1 for house wines before 8

I wanted to see fireworks but was wondering where to go. Enquired a few restaurants and they all wanted minimum spending. Only Kinki. The best restaurant with a heart. Who knows there are people like me who wants to watch the fireworks but don't want to stay outdoor. We had foie gras and scallop sushi. Honestly, if I ever going to die, I hope this is my last meal. Omg...foie gras and scallop combi just melted in my mouth. Now, I know why I think all sushi is mediocal. Thank u, Chef Kinki. U helped me find my love for sushi once again. And we had the unagi fried rice, unagi and scallop roll and of course tempura shrimps. All went well with Hendrick's Sling. How can we not have a Kinki's version of Singapore Sling on National Day?Good job, Kinki. We will be back

So it starts with one thing - sitting by the water as the sun set, smashing a 7-11 happy hour Tiger. That's a thing now, 7-11 knock a dollar or 2 off your beers between 6 and 8ish. As the bootcamp sweated out, I noticed the horrible juxtaposition of Kinki's inauthentic street vibe amongst the glittering marina. Now I don't know a lot about design, but I do know that there is little that shakes my head harder than FINCOM suits drinking pricey cocktails in a curated 'graffiti' bar on the water with Biggie rumbling through the speakers. Inauthentic. Fake. Weak. Lame. This kind of cultural appropriation should be much more illegal than the the real graf of SG. I'm not advocating caning, but seriously, redesign doge, redesign. Of course, after dinner at another crab house, friend who has been in the country for 24 hours says "let's go to Kinki, my friend says it's cool."5 Carlsberg for $50, or $17 a decent beer, good view, artificial vibe, horrible service, even worse uniform.I don't know guys, is this what you want? The website beats its chest about urban attitude. I'm afraid this country hasn't seen urban attitude since LKY came to power and locked up the opposition. HOT TIP FOR EXTRA STREET CRED: the elevator has buttons at both the 'front' and 'back', one is used to go up, the other down. Don't be no geek off the street and press the wrong button, cause when you get on the bus, you get there

Lovely rooftop bar overlooking the Marina. Great BOGO happy hour drinks, and delicious bar snacks - especially sushi sampler and fried chicken bites. We arrived at 17:00 and the place was empty, but was completely packed by 18:30. However, it was never too loud for easy conversation
1
Let me start off by saying, there was only two of us. It is evident the staff are here for one thing and that is to make money, therefore all customer service was directed towards the larger party's at the venue that day. Whether this was 4,6,10 pax. To offer "free flow" beverages whilst not fulfilling the availability to access said beverages is appalling. After finishing our sparkling water, I requested on numerous occasions for a refill - at least 3 different staff members. 20minutes + later I went to the bar directly to ask for refills in which the staff member responded in a rude manor as to say .. we were getting to you.. go sit down. The bottomless food: produce was subpar - scallops, tuna, kingfish all clearly not fresh produce. Honestly to really emphasise their subpar produce was making us wait 30+minutes for each order. (Whilst others who ordered at the same time, same items received it prior). When you think "oh they've just forgotten the item I'll order it again" ... some 10-15minute later after you order the second kit you receive the initial order.At one point we had ordered the ice cream, staff came around asked if we were ready for it, in which we responded yes. It was almost as if they needed to churn the ice cream from the creme anglaise. When the ice cream had finally arrived some 30-40minutes later Priced at 68++ I would highly recommend looking elsewhere as there is nothing to justify the price
4
I went for lunch with two colleagues and fortunately we were able to get a window table. I had the Sushi set, which was good quality with a decent variety of different fish. It's not particularly cheap but reasonable value
4
Great environment. Fun and reliable! No hesitation in recommending this local hotel spot! Food glorious food!
5
Visited Kinki with a friend earlier this Monday.
The Bestest Chirashi Ever!
My friend had the lunch set with japanese curry.
Highly recommend Chirashi or Sashimi sets, as their raw seafood selection are very fresh!
4
We went here after being recommended by a friend in Singapore. Nice location by the marina bay sands- nice view of it too. The sushi was very good- one of the best I've had. It was fresh and just overall very good. Only downfall was that it was very cold inside- I think it was cold to keep the fish more fresh but staff were very attentive and gave us scarfs to keep ourself warm.I would definitely recommend this place to everyone
5
I've come back to this restaurant multiple times now and each time never disappoints. The staff are welcoming , the food is fantastic. If you're a Japanese food aficionado this is the stop for you. The bonus is when you sit next to the windows overlooking the bay. Although after many years , the cushions on the sofa seats are now dated. Regardless, gorgeous place for family and friends getting together
2
Did a 'walk-in' last Saturday for an early dinner with a friend. Almost all tables were empty but only seats at the bar counter were officially available for us. suffice to mention the vast majority of tables were still empty when we left...food was not great. we ordered scallops (2/5 rating), some other sushi/sashimi (3/5), beef terriyaki (5/5), pork belly (2/5), and lamb (2/5). service was terrible. we asked them to serve the pork belly and the lamb one after the other. they acknowledged it but served it together. when i asked about our request they said that it was too difficult to manage as the chefs are busy. oh right.the bill came close to 300 sgd for the 2 of us. we did nt have any wine or sake just one asahi each.sounds like one should come here for dinner? i don't think so
4
Place with a great view on the bay. What makes this place special is the quality of the fish. The salmon was tender and melted in my mouth. The black code awesome. But I fell in love for the carpaccio with truffle.. A bit of more care by the waiters would make this experience not good but great.
2
We booked 2 months prior and were surprised when we arrived to find our table had no view other than past everyone else. Also when we booked I advised my daughter was a vegan, there was nothing vegitarian available other then some nori rolls. Great atmosphere tho if you just want an over priced drink with a possible great vie
2
Have not eaten here but used to frequent the bar on top for quite a while. Service and the attitude of the staff always was a little sub-standard but what kept me returning was the happy hour beer prices. It's like the staff almost had a bit of an attitude and came across that they were doing you a favour by serving you. On a busy day when there are no tables available the staff would make no effort whatsoever to arrange a next available table for you. So there came a point in time that the service and the attitude became such an issue for me that that the prices alone were not enough to attract me back to this place
4
Rooftop Bar Reviewed This is an after work place in the week and will be busy 6 till 9 except for Thursday where it may go on a bit longer (Thurs eve is ladies night in Collier Quay)The food and drinks are happy hour early in the evening, but it just gets better as the sun starts to go down.Full of Singapore's after work crowd and party people. You may find yourself buying drinks for party girls (from outside - not from the barIts a great place - a must chek outBest Thurs and Friday at 6.3
5
Best place to enjoy the friday evening with friends . Its a place to go for a drink .Best location & good snacks
4
Great place to unwind and meet friends and just take in the sights below the buildings of the financial district. Great service and an even better atmosphere. Enjoy your surroundings over beverage. Enjoy.
2
Service extremely slow, even though not busy. One dish, recommended by the server, so unappealing we sent it back. Good view for the light show.
5
Best restaurant in Singapore for Japanese cuisine with amazing views of Marina Bay. Service is fantastic too.
1
Staff has poor service attitude, borders on arrogance. Food is not of great value. Give it a miss. Not planning to return.
3
Location and view was nice, food was fresh and delicious.
Service was a little inattentive and erratic.
5
Oh Kinki, you do spoil us. From the unbeatable views at the rooftop bar to the fab food downstairs paired with a funky street vibe, we find ourselves back here way too often. One to visit if you want a fab dinner with great wine, followed by a boogie under the stars to great RnB tracks
4
We had a birrthday celebration & the restaurant staff helped to arrange for pre- order of Lava cake, nice surprise for the Birthday gal!The only regret is we are asked to vacate our table for next seating when we finished our meal, and we left only to realize that the other side of the restaurant is emplty! This is truly uncalled for, we could have otdered more drinks...
2
Sushi was very good and fresh, but everything else was disappointing and overpriced. Cocktails were way too sweet, like they were from a mix. Agedashi tofu was cold and inedible. Teriyaki chicken ad pork belly were fatty and chewy. And the bill was outrageous for such low quality. Would not go back.
4
Great place for happy hour drinks and to watch the laser show. Beautiful view on their rooftop. Drinks are one for one so you have to get the same drink. Most tables were reserved when we arrived. We were able to sit at one since that table was coming in a couple hours later. Our server was spot on making sure we did get last call before the happy hour ended. We ordered the shrimp skewers which were ok.
4
Happy hour, lots of people, loud but good music. Fab views of the Marina Bay Sands and laguna. We had some small snacks - ok, and beer and wine. Hot singapore night and 30+ age audience. Had a good time .
4
Was there for a work dinner - not too familiar with Japanese food so missed the usual photos of food on menu
1
The food tasted like the ones that is served at your typical Japanese chain restaurant but charged at an exorbitant price. Unless you are willing to pay that much for the view, kinki is one you will won't regret missing out.
5
Always like this place since its very opening a few years back. Amazing marina bay view looking out, food always so tasty. Will come back again for sure.
4
Highly recommended for great views of Marina Bay. Good happy hour drinks deals, and always a good atmosphere with music, and lively crowd.
4
Very nice place and great food. Will defiantly be back. The large windows allows dinners to have a great view of the marina Bay Area. Food was served on time and menu was good.
1
The pork belly was all fat, the fish was cooked in a sweet honey which is a bizarre flavour and the cocktails had ingredients in them that were not listed on menu ie. Blue Curaçao which is not very nice. They tried with the service but didn't even know how to explain what sort of drink ShoChu was. It is so overpriced for what it is, there is no atmosphere and it is beyond freezing like you've walked into a cold room. So disappointed as it was a dinner with my family who were visiting for one night. Would never recommend
3
Overall the food was good, delivered in a timely way with willing and attentive staff. We chose a couple of the more expensive items on the menu - Wagyu steak and the crispy pork belly. Both were almost cold when we received them at the table. Disappointing - given the beef dish was $8
3
Full house! Excellent view ...Drinks are the same as anywhere although considering the price they should be a bit more generous with the alcohol!Music is excellent ...Food : delicious but Super expensive for the quantity. I can say that the quality can not be flawed. I ordered nachos with beef Veg pizza Japanese SGD 68 The food pricing is ridiculous considering that one may not even have a table to put the food on! Great place though!
4
Great views of the harbour and really good tasting food. We enjoyed a lovely meal at Kinky’s one Saturday evening. The service is good but not great, however the food is what makes this place. All the dishes seemed fresh and are worth the price you pay. This is one of the more expensive places we visited in Singapore but would not hesitate to go back. Try the spicy maki rolls
3
Food was good but i waited a long time for my tempura. My colleagues was three quarters done with their meal while I waited. I
4
Food is good! Though a little pricey, but guess that's what to expect in Singapore! Sashimi portions are good and fresh.
4
The food is great and worth the bill. Love the teriyaki beef and black cod fish. The service staff is very attentive as well. No regrets !
5
You can enjoy nice view and fantastic fresh fish !! Recommend you to make a reservation b4 1 week in advance.
4
Great service. Fresh food. Nice atmosphere. Go late, not too crowded. Also reserve your dinner, when it is crowded, they don't allow walk-ins
5
The food is so fresh and so delicious. Me and my friends totally love the sashimi. The services are great too. The ambience of the restaurant is nice and has great view. Will definitely come back for more.
4
Well situated for a dinner after work in the CBD. Great food and efficient service. Only gripe I have about this place is that we had a reservation at 7 p.m. and was told to vacate our seats by 8:15 p.m. for the next sitting. While we understand that we should give our seats up for the next seating, my friends and I thought dinner ended too abruptly
4
I've been here a couple of times for lunch with friends. Their set lunches, though not cheap, offer good quality food at reasonable prices. We had the nori crusted spicy salmon for $30 which came with a salad, miso soup, rice and mochi dessert. The salmon was of a generous serving, cooked perfectly moist and tender. The mochi dessert is always the highlight of my meal because it's delightfully chewy and fragrant - I wish they'd provide 2 pieces instead of 1 every time. I do find the price of $5 for tea a tad exorbitant but you're paying for a nice view with a relaxing ambience. It can get crowded at lunch if you're in a big group so make reservations on Chope
5
The food was fabulous; extremely fresh, great taste and original (Iove the tai carpaccio and the scallops, foie gras sushi!!). Service is also very friendly and the whole place is pretty relaxed. I would not recommend it as the most romantic place but rather for lovers of good food in a relaxed atmosphere
1
Requested when making my reservation for a window seat. When i arrived, i was told that such a request is not guaranteed. Took me a while to get the waiters' attention to take our order and refill my tea. Utterly disappointed. Overall, service standard and quality of food have dropped since my visit last year.
4
One of the first places I went to in Singapore. Now that I've moved here, will definitely be coming back for few drinks in happy hour. Looking forward to watching the view of MBS a lot more in coming months!
5
We celebrated 2015 nye celebrations at Kinki, had an amazing night! I highly recommend Kinki Bar and wish to be back!
4
The restaurant has a splendid view of mbs. Food is good too, except portion a bit small. Be prepared to spend abit more than average.
4
Loved the food. The spicy miso edamame was yum and I finished an entire bowl full of it! I also enjoyed the asparagus sushi and the Japanese pizza that was very different and a nice and interesting change. Love the place and love the view!
1
Called me everyday to remind me of my reservation and the need to return the table after 1h 15min even though there was no second sitting arriving. Was chased out even though there were non guests arriving and restaurant was 3/4 empty. They could have sat at another table.
5
This is my first time at Kinki restaurant and I must say it is a fantastic place to visit! Firstly, the atmosphere and decor is fantastic. Sets the mood for a nice evening. Beautiful scenery of the Marina watching the sun go down. The food is just amazing! From the sashimi to the mains, there wasn't anything that I could complain about. Service was prompt and the place wasn't overly noisy that you cannot converse with your friends or partner. Yet another great place to go to in Singapore
3
Agree with the other reviews - this place is usually packed and owes much of its popularity to the very nice view of Marina Bay. Food is average, not terrible but not top quality Japanese either. On the whole this is fine for a casual but pricy business lunch or a convenient spot to meet friends working in the MBFC/Raffles Place area. One thing that stuck. The manager had a very odd sense of humour - when I asked for our table he said is was cancelled then promptly said he was kidding (!). I can't imagine this goes done well with anyone
4
Third or fourth time I've been here now. Great place, good and helpful staff, amazing sushi and a nice view on Marina Bay Sands. Nothing more to say actually, if you like sushi, you'll love this place. Only minor point is not a lot of choice on desserts.
3
Business lunch here on a busy Friday. Service was slow and we seemed to have a different person bringing us different things. Views are spectacular of Marina Bay. Food was well prepared and sashimi in particular was delicious. They could do with better and more Otha used wait staff
4
You get a spectacular view of the Marina Bay Sands and the skylineFantastic service from the service crewbut food that is just average, nothing to shout about. Tried the foie gras and scallop sushi, their signature pork belly dish, unagi fried rice, and tempura soba. Everything was just average. Its not exactly fantastic or authentic, considering the crowd is largely locals and caucasians. You'll get an incredible fare around the corner for that same price and patronised by largely Japanese (justifying its authenticity). Than again, if you're looking for a nice place to chill, great atmosphere and incredible view, you've came to the right place. :
4
food is good, and reasonable for the price and quality. Attentive service. location is also good, and window seats have great view of the Marina Bay.
3
Food was great, ambience was good. Service is pretty good but theres still room for improvement. Diners will value honest and timely responses from the service staff!
5
The food was fantastic, with everything ranging from the sushi to the rice and the innovative Japanese pizza delightful to the palette. I must mention the tofu steak was absolutely amazing. Highly recommend the place :)
2
Recommended by colleagues, seems good for groups, service was average to low, drinks and bar food was very over priced for the location and level of attention. Music was O.K.
3
Good spot to stop in for a drink, including happy hour and rooftop experience. Don't expect too much from the service, but meets the need if not in a hurry and looking for a convenient CBD adjacent location for drinks with friends or work colleagues.
5
Great restaurant and rooftop bar. Good selection of sushi, all freshly prepared with good quality fish. Beautiful view over Marina Bay. Perfect spot for eating great sushi and drinking sake.
4
Visited Kinki at the recommendation of my local expat friend, for a late night bite and it exceeded expectations. The food was of extremely high quality, super fresh and tasty. The Maki and Tataki were exceptional. Service was good and strongly suggest when visiting, to pop up to the rooftop bar. Great music and a good crowd.
2
I went back to Kinki because we enjoyed a grat evening the first time. The 2nd time was an absolute disaster. The waiter just did not show up so we had to get up and asked to be served. The first drinks arrived excactly after 30 minutes we entered the place. So forget the service. The food was great again but maybe they should turn this into a take away place. This obviously would be a pitty because the views are great
3
This is a heck of a busy restaurant and for that i think they should definitely have an extra 2-3 staff. As it seems understaffed, it takes a while to get their attention and at times, you have to repeat what you want. I requested wasabi 3 times to 3 waiters and soy sauce 3 times too. The food, the ambience and the view makes up for the lack of service and of course the prices are high up there due to the location. Had i gotten better service, this would probably have been 4 stars! Something to think about guys
4
located right next to the fullerton bay hotel, this was a great meeting place for post-conference at marina bay sands (just a 10 minute walk away). we ordered about 6 different sushi rolls (rolls that you generally find more in the states like spicy tuna with avocado, spider rolls, etc) and they were all delicious! we had three small bottles of sake plus a dessert at the end....and between three people, we paid $112 SGD. it's got a great location, environment, and food, but be prepared to pay for all that. having said that though, i would visit again if im in the area again
4
Fab view, food and service. Absolutely awesome choice of dishes and wine. Great views and very prompt and attentive service. I loved the sushi and sashimi dishes and the combinations were unique and flavorful. Definitely will visist again.
4
With a fun manga-inspired yet classy decor, the restaurant serves interesting modern Japanese dishes. Perfect for causal dining and drinks after work. Its location at the Customs House gives diners a beautiful view of the Marina Bay Sands waterfront.
3
Good view and I love the restaurant but the rooftop bar is average. Decor is kind of shabby considering price of drinks and service is not very attentive.
5
I've eaten at Kinki about four times now and it's never failed to impress. On our most recent visit we tried a couple of new dishes, my favourite being the pork belly - this was the best pork belly we've ever had, such an amazing texture and taste! Couldn't recommend this one highly enough. The scallop and foie gras sushi is inspired, I could happily eat about 8 of these. Always a good atmosphere in this place, unusual decor and decent music in the background. Service is attentive, empty plates are never left on the table for long, but this is done without being intrusive. Get a table by the window too for a great view of Marina Bay.Prices aren't cheap but you won't be complaining once you've tried the food - well worth it
5
Don't get put off or be prejudiced by the name. Trust me. THE PLACE to be at night in Singapore for a drink. Vibes. Views. Well, depends on what ur checking out!Had a wasabi drink. Sensational. Crowd was upmarket decent. Music was good. Views of the bay area are phenomenal
4
The food was good, and the table by the window definitely gives a breath taking view. However, the price was way too high. Ordered a sushi dish and ended up serving only 2 sushi pieces at $30 plus. While I recognize that the sushi was really good, i think prices could go lower.
4
Great view of the waterfront (Marina Bay) - ask for a window seat. This is a place that would be great for a larger group in the sense it would allow you to have more dishes. We settles for some edamame and rolls - which was just perfect for 2. Would have loved to try more though. Service was very nice and absolutely value for money. Seafood was fresh as it should be in a sushi place.
4
Delicious sushi, not exactly a cheap lunch menu but the raw fish tasted very fresh. A great view and all around nice spot for lunch. Only downside is I noticed they charge $5 per person for green tea, so we paid $15 for a party of 3. I tend to feel green tea in a sushi spot should be FREE
3
After I booked the restaurant for 3 at 7PM via Chope! Online Reservation Website, the restaurant emailed and informed about their 2 seating timings for dinner at 6.30PM and 8.30PM. I was advised to finish my dinner by 8.15PM. This was further reminded via a phone call the day before my reservation. It felt unwelcoming even before I go to the restaurant because it's wasn't stated clearly on the reservation website and the restaurant website as well.My friends and I arrived the restaurant at 7.10PM and quickly ordered our food. The serving of the food was very slow and the restaurant was barely full house. Guests are still streaming in around 7.30PM to 7.45PM (what's about the 2 dinner seating timings??). We only managed to finish our dinner by 8.15PM. Food serving took so long probably because we had been kept reminded to finish by 8.15PM. At 8.35PM, while we waiting for the slow service clearing our bills, the hostess came and chase us out. She could have check with the waitress if we are clearing our bills and not to chase us while we waiting for the bill to come to us! There are guests whom arrived earlier than us, sitting around but the hostess did not chase them out.I felt so unwelcomed to the restaurant and the service was average. Nothing fantastic about the service and food is not fantastic. The only good thing is the nice ambiance because of the good view over to MBS. Other than that, nothing to rave about.
3
Great location with splendid view of MBS. More a place for drinks (especially at night) than for food. The sushi/sashimi is really mediocre, cooked dishes are more interesting, but it's way overpriced. If you're a serious foodie, you'd be better off paying up a bit and go to the grandees of Japanese cuisine. No wonder it's popular with ang mo working in the CBD
3
Good after work place for drinks. The place gets more chaotic as people get drunk. Nice view and casual dress code- not pretentious like other rooftop bars. Had dinner there once and thought the food was decent. Service was not stellar.
5
The Sushi's and Sashimi's were mind blowing.The Japanese Sngle malt(Nikka) was one of the finest that I have had.Good spread for vegetarians too.Japanese food lovers go for it you won't be disappointed.
4
High quality and authentic Japanese restaurant with a wonderful view over the bay. Enjoy a nice dinner on the second floor and enjoy drinks outside by the water on the 3floor. Reservation recommend.
4
This place is a little hard to find within the Customs House block. The restaurant is on the 1st floor with the rooftop bar on the 2nd floor and access is via 1 small-ish lift, but there are signs showing you were the lift is. Rooftop bar gets crowded but is very unfussy and has great views over the dock, and surrounding areas (the Fullerton Bay Hotel is right next door with rooms overlooking the bar!!) This is great place to watch the laser and light show at 8pm and coincides with the end of happy hour too so is great timing. Prices are not extortionate and there is a DJ in a booth playing a variety of music which changes as the night moves on and the clientèle changes
4
My wife and I had a fantastic dinner at Kinki. The food was delicious, the service excellent (attentive enough, but not invasive) and they even gave us the window seat looking out over the water.It's not cheap. However, if you're after a really nice dinner in Singapore, but don't want to pay the exorbitant prices most top restaurants charge, this is your place.Bonus tip: Arrive early and have a drink upstairs at the rooftop bar while you watch the harbour lightshow
1
we booked the table for 5 and was asked to arrive by 630pm n was reminded numerous time that we have to vacate by 815pm. the restaurant was only occupied by 3-4 tables and abt 10 others were available. so we asked them if their restaurant was full. they said yes. so we ordered and ate. some of the food came fast while others slow. we ordered a variety of food, some cooked ones and some maki and some sashimi. when we ordered 3 types of sashimi n realised one of them the hamachi was not fresh n when we told them they said the hamachi have a fishy smell n Taste and it's normal! gosh! fresh sashimi may have some fish smell but fresh ones do not leave a terrible smell. anyway amongst us, we have eaten at nice restaurants in singapore n japan and only fish that are not fresh smell.that wasn't the spoiler. but what irritated us was that they insisted that we vacate n when we did, we realised that there are other empty tables but they just wanted ours! strange when we said we don't mind sitting anywhere as we would like to order more food n alcohol. anyway won't be going back since the food was not fab n service was not quite there n their eagerness to drive us out worked very well.
4
Nice range of lunch sets with prompt service and in a lovely ambience with view of the waterfront. What more can you ask for?!I was there on a weekday and finished the meal within an hour. The tofu steak and spicy salmon sets were delicious and good value. Came with a salad and pickles and even a small red bean mochi to finish the meal off nicely. Service was attentive and efficient.
4
Very chic with a wonderful view of Marina Bay Sands, and Marina Bay. Most may opt to sit at the sushi bar, but the views are really a nice complement to the chief’s creations. Never in my life would I think about combining Foie Gras & Scallop Sushi, but this was a wonderful combination. Kinki’s Customs are a very unique combination of ingredients that I would have never expected to be combined with Sushi and Sashimi. The service was very good, and the staff were properly trained to present their wines. Overall we had a very good time, and a unique experience
5
The food serve looks inviting and tastes amazing! Their sashimi is super fresh too! Esp the sea bream! Ambience was nice and there's a rooftop bar tat was veri relaxing. Staffs are friendly and have initiatives esp the asst manager, Shahrul who surprise me a cake knwoig it's my birthday!
4
This is a decent choice for drinks after work, but unfortunately there are many other people who feel the same way. As a result, it gets pretty crowded and the fact that access is via just 1 small lift can make the entry and exit dynamics rather unsatisfactory. Great views and relatively efficient service given the large number of people
