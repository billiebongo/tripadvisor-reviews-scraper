A nice hideaway with smaller food portion of food serving which is good to avoid any wastage. The assorted chips was fantastic. Thin and crispy.

Was worried couldn’t find the place , followed GPS and arrived at place. Free parking avail at sides of road. Cafe opened at 11am and only at certain days.
Nice ambience, free Wifi. Friendly staffs, very cozy place. Can meet friends here for gathering.

Nice selection of local/fusion cafe fare. Food is good, not spectacular but well executed. Overall, I enjoyed the flourless chocolate cake and coffee the most. We also found the environment relaxing and cozy for a cuppa over a book or catch-up with friends.

Love to come here for coffee and dinner with my friends and families. Their exclusive grandma beehoon on Saturday morning is very nice, and fried rice are my all time favorite!
Staffs are very friendly.

Chill corner cafe in Bukit Timah. Quiet place with good ambience. Decent food but might be a tad pricey.

Absolutely enjoyed my time there. The place is quiet and away from the usual crowds. The food we had were great -- the teriyaki mushroom fried rice was delicious, as were the sauteed calamari (a refreshing change from fried calamaris!). Everything looks healthy and still tastes great. The flourless chocolate cake was amazing but even more to-die-for was their super rich hot chocolate. And on top of all of that, we had the sweetest service staff serving us that night! Will return with other friends for sure

Came here over the weekend to try the coffee and hot chocolate. There's a good vibe inside and the staff are really friendly, bringing a bottle of water over without even being prompted. Hot chocolate is a bit expensive at $7 for a small glass, but it's really good quality

The Fettuccine al Ragu ($14.90) & Pappardelle al Verde con Funghi ($14.90) I had for lunch was ON POINT as well, so much that I felt like eating either again for dinner. At first glance, you might think there is too much cheese just by looking at it - but after you mix everything up, it melts & binds everything together.. So no, there isn't too much cheese The Ragu is more generous with ingredients (minced pork & beef), but I prefer the Pappardelle for its flavours. I am a sucker for runny eggs & mushrooms. Very happy with both pastas being executed perfectly al dente & so flavourful.Cuppa-Caffeine of choice: White Coffee (4/6/8oz - $5.50) - opted for the largest size & a Pourover ($7.00) with Kenyan beans. Both were excellent & delicious.Dessert was scrumptious too: Apple Tart Tatin ($10.00), which has a preparation time of 30 minutes; so it's best to order it at the start of your meal 'cos it's gonna take a while. Does not look like much, but is a pleasant dessert. The pastry added a nice chewy texture to the soft apple in the center-- which, btw, the apple is PIPING HOT so watch out when you tuck in! Surprisingly, it is NOT as sweet as I feared it would be. Delightful!There aren't a lot of seats here; thankful to have arrived early because at the end of our meal, it was so packed that people had to share tables. Necessary Provisions does take reservations on Chope, but there is a minimum spend of $15 per person when you do that, so do bear that in mind. Accepts credit cards️ Air conditioned seats available Al fresco seats available WiFi available No GST or service charg

Food is not bad, but on a steeper side, we had a fresh chips, seasonal pasta, and pork rice. Ambient is actually quite quiet too, nice for a drink session with friends. The place is not big, However, its not accessible if you go via public transport

I have read a lot about this place and finally gotten to try it. The ulu place is what I am looking for and thought that it will be a good experience. Indeed, it was nice and service was good. However, the food was nothing to shout about

Service was excellent and fast. Ordered the $18 grilled prawn pasta and $12 buta don. Pasta was rather dry and plain. The pork slices in the buta don was tough. The rice was normal rice, not japanese rice, with insufficient gravy to coat the rice. Overpriced, the kind of food you would expect at a food court for half the price

Decided to explore my new neighbourhood. Drove to this little cafe in this quaint neighbourhood on a lazy Sunday morning. Ambience is nice and relaxing. Lacks the aroma of freshly brewed coffee. Coffee was okay, acidic on the first mouth. Food menu listed simple fares, nothing overly fancy. They should not bet it too wrong. Verdict, they tried to be creative but food is not their strength. Can consider giving this place a miss

The first time I went to this cafe was some time back, about a couple of years ago. It was okay. Drink was not okay but the staffs were friendly. They also serve flourless cake that were not cheap and small but I do like the place for a quiet read of their Nylon magazines. My recent visit was a terrible experience. The mocha coffee was the worst coffee I ever had. It was sour and difficult to swallow. I was not the only one to say this. Their black coffee was sour as well. Not too bad but definitely not to our liking. I'm not a coffee expert but definitely can feel what is terrible. When I ask the staff why does it taste so weird and sour, he replied that that's how it is because of the chocolate they use and gave me a look like I didn't know how to appreciate it. It's my problem. Personally I can accept bad services due to the lack of trainings and inexperienced staffs, but if the food/drinks are bad, I think it's really unacceptable.

Table setting was very poorly designed. So you expect to share your table with others walk in. Menu is plain with no picture for reference but no worry, cause you won't expect much. Drinks are pricey ($7).Paying $17 for a plate of pathetic pasta with burned cherry tomatoes, over cooked hard chicken meat and uncooked fusilli when my 11 years old son can cook better than that.Obviously very inexperience staff. Was told that they already cook 11mins so it's good with the pasta. Come on, Jamie Oliver will take a bite of the pasta before he drain them out. Anyone with cooking experience would. The next table complained the same issue and who's coming back for more of such food? Don't expect this cafe will last long especially if they still couldn't accept complains and relook their standards. Thumbs down

Three of us went there. Ordered latte and turned out to be terrible taste. Ice chocolate is bland taste. When provided feedback, they said its house blend coffee so it's supposed to be sourish. Portion size too small glass and not worth the money. Sambal fried rice was served with anchovies with heads on! No Pandan chiffon cake. It's a disappointment. Never return again

Great place for a craft beer and wonderful choice of snacks - we didn't have a main meal but I did see they offer daily specials and home made desserts.We had the artichoke dip with wonderful chunks of toasted bits of bread and the chicken wings. Staff where wonderful and friendly! We will be going back.Check opening times before going

We found this gem by a happy accident.. It is tucked away in a lovely neighborhood, and we just happened to walk around there searching for an organic store. It is a perfect place for a weekend brunch (and a stroll). Friendly staff, good food and coffee, reasonably priced. It's biggest plus being the lovely tucked away location and cozy atmosphere

Arrived at 10am, opening time for brunch on Public Holidays. When greeted, we were told kitchen wouldn't open until 12 noon, so only coffee & cakes for next 2 hours. All those wait (around 12 people left as they came with family or friends for brunch). We came here as this was meant to be great coffee. So u can imaging my stunned look when told "we don't do short macc's or anything exotic. We only do the 1 style of coffee but vary foam level". So these guys have turned coffee in McDonald's ... & I don't mean it as a complement.Deliver: our banana bread was cold, despite 2 attempts to warm it. Our coffee was ok, but far too foamy for me as I love espressos or short macc's not latte or cap's. Ultimately a real disappointment as attitude & results were a real"can't do sorry".

We frequent this cosy cafe many times in a month. They always have our favourite Pandan cake, although the texture can be much more light weighted but nonetheless we love it! And they do have selection of different types of beer! Do try if you are adventurous

I was at Necessary Provisions on a Sunday afternoon at around 4-5pm. However most of the food on the menu was not available, and only bakes were sold. Even then, not many options were left - only a few slices of chiffon cake and cookies were left on display. Perhaps this could be something to work on, because there were still quite a number of customers streaming in.Nevertheless the cafe had a nice cosy atmosphere, thoughtful deco, and friendly service (always a plus)! The coffee comes in 3 different sizes, and was decent.
