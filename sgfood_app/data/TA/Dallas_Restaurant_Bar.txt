Visited with a few work colleagues after work. Had the meat platter for 4 at $180 which we felt was a good deal. Just the right amount of food for 4.

I have been to this place a few times. I love their set menu and fried calamari and the simple decor. Food price is reasonable, service is good. It's a rather popular place with many people. it's located on the Sky Garden level.

We love the ambience & service was great. The set menu was reasonably priced & I love my medium done steak.
1
The steak was really bad: greasy and row! They forgot a drink! They are slow! They wouldn't make a sauce to the dish, because the sauce isn't to that steak, but another...

Attended a wedding dinner on a Friday evening. Surprised to find a nice ambiance bar-bistro concept restaurant at sky garden of Suntec. Food and service is good with good view.
A good place to hang out with friends.

Well, every time I come.fo the mall I've said I want to try this place out and haven't.Finally, I've made it.I was pleasantly surprised. The decor is really nice, more upscale than I thought.The restaurant was half full for lunch. We ordered some mocktails and beer.And for main course we got pulled pork sandwich which was good and I got the chicken BLT. Wow both were large portions and the fries were really delicious esp with seasoning they put on them. The only negative, is, service was very slow. They didn't come to check on how the meal was or if we needed anything etc
5
Was there for a business dinner. There were 2 or 3 course dinner to choose from besides alacarte. Food portion was huge and with nice food presentation. Prices of set dinners from 20+ for 2 course, to up to 40+ for a 3 course. Ambience was also nice and in a green house environment. Most crowds are working adults on a Tuesday night.
4
It was more crowded than we expected. The two course set meal was value for money and the portion served was of a good size. The medium rare steak was perfect, not bloody yet tender. We shared a side (jalapeÃ±o) and a dessert - and we were already stuffedWait staff was helpful and added to the whole positive dining experienc

I used to visit Hog's Breath in CHIJMES on days I am craving fora good steak but ever since they closed, I was stranded for options for good steaks (put aside your fine-dining options like Morten's or CUT). I was introduced to this place by a friend who assured me that the chefs at Dalla knew a thing or two about their meat, so I thought I'd give it a go. We had their meat platter (recommended for 3-4 persons) and dang was it delicious! I returned back with my partner for as he was craving for a good steak and he (without a second thought) agreed with me. He ordered their Southern Burger; 220gram of 100% Black Angus Beef patty with lettuce, tomato, cheese, BBQ sauce and relish (served with Dallas fries and homemade coleslaw) whilst I had their Avocado Chicken Parmigiana; Pan fried panko-crusted chicken breast topped with melted mozzarella, pasta sauce and avocado (served with salad greens and Dallas fries). HUGE portions - as you can see in the photos uploaded) and worth every dollar! There was also a special promotion to pair your meal up with beer, which my partner opted.We left with happy tummies and will be back again

I went with some friends to Dallas at Suntec and was pleasantly surprised with the great food and drinks plus service there! I was a bit worried when the establishment called to reconfirm my reservation and informed me that it would be noisy as there was a corporate event that took out a part of their dining area. I found that while there's quite a few people, they segregated the corporate event in another part of the restaurant so the noise level was quite acceptable. With my reservation, I didn't have to wait for my table eventhough I was earlier than the time I reserved. We were able to get food and drinks pretty promptly and the waiters and waitresses were quite friendly and helpful. The meat platter was yummy, served with salad. Only meat that was slightly overcooked was the ribs. Other than that, the steak, lamb chop, chicken were done perfectly. I liked the choice of sauces that accompanied the dish too. We also ordered nachos, which was quite good
5
Great food and service, a real hidden gem for lunch on a hot Saturday afternoon.
Would highly recommend and will be back

Food was good - recommend the meat platter. Service was good - polite n they know what to recommend.

Perfect drinks and friendly staff.
We hope to see you again.
Kind regards

Initially only stopped for a drink but stayed for dinner. Great food and staff very friendly. Definitely a place to return to.

Excellent steak in a very nice ambiance and location-- not super affordable but reasonably priced with good service

I have frequented a few Dallas establishments and have had some great nights in them. But today i was asked to meet at the Dallas Restaurant in Suntec for a business meeting and was unsure this would be the wrong venue.How wrong was I, the Sky Bar area is a great place to stop and the restaurant has that classy Gastro feel.Service was great and the food was the most surprising of all... No basket of chicken wings here.At great venue, great food ... Well Done Mr Dallas for turning your franchise up a gear

Went on a quiet Wednesday evening. Wow. Almost full house, surprisingly! Their crab cakes are so real, fresh and delicious! I took the red snapper part of the set meal, not much to boast but fresh nevertheless. Hubby took the steak burger, think he finds it yum! In general, good tasting food, and good portion sizes. The full glass window and high ceiling makes the ambience so relaxing, awesome for a dinner date! I was there with our 9month old, and given a cosy corner. Staff were super friendly and helpful on our quandoo booking and voucher usage too! Lots of pluses, go ahead and take your date there

Dallas @ Suntec is our favorite bar for meeting with friends and colleagues. In past two years, I have visited Dallas numerous times and have always left the place with more than happy satisfaction – exceeding expectations anytime and every time.I would like to express special thanks to the manager Ms Cindy Villacorte for never ending customer satisfaction attitude. She ensures customers are well greeted, paid attention to detail of their choices (based on frequent visits) and deliver more than expected. I see Cindy as a great asset for Dallas at Suntec.Ever smiling, Very friendly and attentive are top most amongst other qualities of Ms Cindy.Once again thank you Dallas for all our entertainment and thank you Cindy for making Dallas our hangout/entertainment hub

Went there for my younger son's birthday. Had an excellent dinner (had made reservations in advance). I would definitely recommend the calamari, big chunks with great taste, best we have had.The boys ordered the meat platter, which was fine. Had too much chicken and not enough ribs, in my opinion. But the meats were good.Their 28$ selection of meals are quite good and come with a soup/salad and a dessert.I had chicken fajita, which was also good. Would surely return, perhaps this time for lunch. One word of caution: we shared with the staff it was our son's 14th, so they did bring out our dessert with a candle and a decorated Happy Birthday, but it was quietly slipped to our table. SO looks like this is not the place if you are expecting a HBD song for the children. Any case a great place for meals
5
The best meal we have had on our trip to Singapore! Best steaks we've EVER had!! This place is an absolute gem and we will definitely be back before we have to go back home.Great atmosphere, staff and menu.The manager is also fantastic. So attentive and friendly. Everything is so well laid out and very lovely and clean. Would recommend a meal here anyway.
5
We had 4 very delicious set meals comprising of crab bisque, prime rib steak, brownies & ice cream. Service was great. Staff took initiative to provide different kinds of sauces to go with the steak.
Location of restaurant at Suntec City is convenient
4
We all had a really nice dinner! The set menu had lots of variety and the steak was indeed extremely nice! There was a great selection of wines at reasonable prices! Service was ok and the place was nice and breezy for alfresco experience.
4
We ordered Dallas Platter but was served the Meat Platter... We wanted only beer and finger food. Was surprised at the huge plate of meat... which we couldn't finished and the bill didn't tally with our order too... haha! But we didn't kick a fuss as we enjoyed the Meat Platter. Nice place with lovely ambience. You get 20% discount if you visit between 5-6.30pm.
5
If your are a meat lovers, this place has unlimited steak serve on weekends and price is very reasonable at S$45. We decide here for our family dinner as my son just love steak. They do serve other type of dishes and has nice ambient, good place for big group too. Nice of them to give us ice-cream brownies for Father Day's
5
Went to Suntec Sky Garden for this seemingly hidden dining gem.Good place to dine with family, friends and colleagues if you crave for Western dish delights. It has very nice ambiance, and well arranged layout. Food was excellent with generous serving, especially the Calamari. We went for the 2 and 3 course meal sets that exceeded our expectations for Western meals. Highly recommend their Fajita and Fish Taco. Lastly, their staff were very nice, patient and very professional. A sumptuous, dining pleasure that we will definitely come back to
5
We were looking for a place to eat as the hotel restaurant was very pricey and we found this place , we were advised to book as it does get quite busy especially with businesses holding events there.The service is good, the restaurant is clean and spacious the staff are pleasant and efficient, the food is tasty and well presented and as stated we enjoyed our first visit we booked to go back the next night and we were not disappointed , can definitely recommen
5
Meat platter is reasonably priced! Great ambience to hang out and staff were very warm and friendly. Will come back for the steak again
5
Was introduced to this place by my cousin and ended up having a very impressive lunch with a group of 10 people. As it's situated in the sky garden, the restaurant is done up like a glasshouse in which some sunshine comes thru the top, but the aircon is strong enough that it didn't feel hot. The staff were all very friendly and managed very well despite the restaurant being almost full. What was the most impressive was the food quality and portions. We ordered the mix appetizer platter for 4, quesadilla for 4, mix meat platter for 2, a salad and a plate of calamari(a must have!) . Not only did it fill all our tummies to the brim, we even had some food left to take home!Definitely will be coming back here soon
5
First thing that struck me when I entered the restaurant is how beautiful it was with ceiling to floor windows showing the city view. Ambience was great. And the food meets the expectations one has when a restaurant is this nice. The rib steak was very good but topped by the lamb. My friends swear by the salmon. Warning: food portions are huge (for an Asian I guess)
5
I love this place. Cosy atmosphere and friendly waiting staff. The set meal is value for money. We usually share a set meal but have more of the side dishes. I still rate that they have the best steak and fish tacos. Nicely done with the right grill taste in your mouth. The key lime pie is worth trying.
5
Dallas Restaurant & Bar is the only place to go for the best Prime Rib in Singapore. With great service and good prices, Dallas is a must.
4
Chose this place for a relaxed biz lunch where we could get a little western (American) food after a long week of Asian delights. Good service, nice selection of dishes and reasonable price. This place would be great for evening drinks.
5
Great fish, steak..and best of all fresh burgers. Unlimited prime rib deal on the weekend, fabulous appetizers (all freshly made)
Try the calamari appetizer made with fresh squid, freshly battered, fried and served
I really like the location, roof of Suntec, and the views
4
I was there with my team for a dinner. The location, ambience, food and all are very good. But there is room/section which is rented by customers for their events/party. The speakers were too loud and caused lot of disturbance
4
Good food, delicious. Very nice ambiance and friendly service- though very slow.. overall, very good experience
4
Must try their Prime Rib Steak ... so tender and superb, however the portion is very big and filling but really worth to try
service is ok, not many staff around, the restaurant temperature was very cold, freezing

As usual, we all know that on Valentine's Day many restaurants will be serving their set menu and also specific time for dinning. After browsing through some blogs, I notice comments were good on their food so I decided to give it a try. I took up their Valentine's set menu as that was the only menu and was asked to choose the timing for seating so I chose 8.30pm instead as since most working adults would end work at 6pm. My partner and I arrived at Dallas at 7.30pm knowing it was early, we just wanted to try our luck but true enough, you can only be seated at 8.30pm. So at 8.25pm when we went back they were still not ready. By 8.30pm a queue starting forming and again true enough, even if you are told 8.30pm seating the turn around time was an issue cos you would not be seated by 8.30pm despite the fact that many couples were on time, why cos at 8.30pm they were clearing the first seating couples and needed time to clean the tables. During the queue, I even notice they said to some couples, the table is not ready yet so which mean continue to wait. As the queue was on the left and right side, the lady started doing alternate side and ultimately, she did not know what to do and did only the right side ignoring all the couples on the left until one guy went to ask the lady and tell the lady. To cut short, we only started at 9pm for dinner. Given a table, our table candle was not lit while most other tables were lit and the person who even lead us to our seat did not even notice. For this, it ended with the whole entire dinner, the candle was not lit despite me saying twice to the service crew. My partner and I ordered a cups of white wine and also selected our main dish (steak friters). Not long, our first dish came which was the Lobster Bisque. The taste was not bad just a little too peppery. The next thing we knew, the cups for water came but again disappointment, the way the water were serve to tables had no sequence and the lady keep on skipping tables until the table beside us decided to just raise their hands to ask for water, we followed along seeing that water will never be poured to our glasses. The second dish - grilled king prawn, came and two best part about this dish (1) super cold dish of which I didn't know if it was meant to be cold or warm or hot (2) it was a sharing dish but no plates were serve to us so the both of us just have to eat it as per it while i saw some tables being serve plates so that they can share the dish. Where is the consistency. When the second dish was serve, we asked what happen to our wine, the waiter said he will check no respond. After waiting a while, we asked another waitress and she said she will check again no wine came. Lastly, I was annoyed, I ask one of the lady of which seem like the manager as she was dress in a black sleeveless dress different from the rest of the service crew - 'How many more times do I need to ask for the two cups of wine', already done with my second dish and still no wine. Next the third dish came which was our steak, nothing fantastic all I tasted was the black pepper sauce which overwhelm every single taste of the meat, salad and fries that was on the plate. It was so black peppery that your taste buds can get numb after a while. The dessert I think was the only 1 dish which we felt it was decent. The whole experience was NOT WORTH IT!! The set up was as if all couples were there for blind dates. Serve crew not well trained at all. NO MANAGEMENT SKILLS.

We actually came twice to this Restaurant and Bar. It is very clean on top of Suntec City in the Sky Garden. The service was excellent. We did not eat too much but enjoyed the Chicken Quesadillas as well as drinks. I like the Oyster Bay White Sav Blanc and at 16.00 per glass can be considered a little pricey. My husband likes Erdinger Weisbier beer and that too is 16.00 each. Singapore as a rule is quite pricey where drinks are concerned, especially wines

Established in March 2006 in Boat Quay, Dallas Restaurant & Bar is now well into its 10th year of operation, and still going strong, having opened its 2nd outlet in Suntec City in June 2015. Founded by Jason Pope, with assistance from wife Felicity Pope, the Australian couple behind the equally successful casual Western dining brand The Rotisserie, Dallas Restaurant & Bar is their take on hearty American cuisine. With Dallas Restaurant & Bar, they've implemented the same 5 factors that lend them to success with The Rotisserie, offering quality food, quality beverages, great service, great ambience, and affordable prices.Ambience at Dallas Restaurant & Bar differs by location, though both are modern elegant, exuding a chic sophistication. The Boat Quay outlet has 2 levels. The 1st level is a casual bar, with high bar stools and a al-fresco area that allows for people watching. The 2nd level has a quiet intimacy, warm lighting with plush cushioned booths and sleek black chairs, against colours of wood and red. The Suntec City outlet is beautiful with ample natural lighting, a water feature, and a high ceiling surrounded by glass panels that offer good views of the city. The spacious area has a clean, minimalist look. Little wonder you can hold events, including wedding solemnizations, at both venues. The atmosphere of fine luxury and elegant sophistication makes you feel like you should dress up for a visit, however, there is no dress code enforced here. I once showed up in shorts and slippers, and still got a seat! Great ambience, checked.Service at Dallas Restaurant & Bar is friendly, professional, and engaging. Staff are quick to greet and seat guests, offer goodbyes when they leave, and clear away empty / dirty plates after each course. I notice staff change the tablecloths after guests leave as well, setting out a fresh set in preparation for the next diner. The experienced staff display good product knowledge, able to offer recommendations, though the menu helpfully has clear descriptions of dishes. I like that the experienced staff will come around regularly to interact with diners, checking for feedback on your dining experience, and offering to top-up water. However, the same cannot be said of the junior / new staff, who are clueless at times. Owner Jason Pope personally overseees the operations from time to time, and he'll come around to chat with guests. Overall, the service feels welcoming, comfortable, and attentive. Great service, checked.Food at Dallas Restaurant & Bar is, as its name suggests, American cuisine, with a focus on Southern comfort food with a dash of Tex-Mex. A major reason they've done so well in Singapore is because all their dishes are executed to an above average standard in both taste and texture, and the quality is consistent throughout the years. Generally, dishes here pack good flavour, and hit the right notes for texture. Portions are large and hearty, usually more than sufficient even for large eaters. Quality food, checked. Prices here are wallet-friendly, comparable to most bistros, but lower than most restaurants. For the quality and standard, I consider it to be value for money, and even tertiary students are able to dine here. Budget about SGD $48 per person for a full 3-course meal here. Affordable prices, checked. Love my dining experiences at Dallas Restaurant & Bar, and will return for more

The environment is awesome. The rain has displaced the beauty of the french windows with the The beef is excellence. Good juicy cut with adequate char to enhance the overall favor. Unfortunately, the services are unbearable slow.The resturant is not crowded but we only managed to get our order after half an hour. Multiple reminders needed to get our requests met.The management team needs to review their service coordination.
5
Nice experience nice food nice location... "perfect" the meat platter very tasty and big and the dessert like the apple pie with caramel so delicious
4
Ambience is really good here, with a nice view of city backdrop and full glass window panels. Portions are large making the pricing worth it, perhaps too large for my Asian appetite. Quality is average though..
5
Nice view, good services and good foods. Tried their Prime rib steak medium, and deluxe steak burger. Both came with very big portion and yummy taste. Definitely will recommend this place.
4
Indoor dining area is quite limited, but ambience is great. Staff informed about the full reservation situation during dinnertime at doorstep which I appreciate much, at least we were pre-empt about leaving within a certain timing and we were alright. Food such as burgers and mains are huge, good value for money. We also ordered beer as happy hour ends at 8pm. Great ambience with changes of dawn to night as backdrop. Good venue for lovely romance meal

Visited for a team dinner for work. The setting was nice and totally unexpected. Very surprised and menu price looked affordable as well. If you order before 6.30pm there is a 20% discount on mains - not too bad at all. When we arrived, there was even a menu special for 2-3 courses, and wait staff made good recommendations. The view was spectacular as we watched the sun set in the city. The choice of music was weird. The place looked like a nice place to have a quiet/relaxing dinner, but the music was pop and hip/hop?? Ordered the Southern Burger and it was good. No complains there. Friends ordered the steak and it was horrible. Order medium rare, it came well done. Steak was tough to touch. And this was not just on one order of the steak but on all 3 steaks that we ordered. Not acceptable considering that the steak is about 40SGD per main. Perhaps its cut a little too thickly (250gms) and the chef did not know how to chargrill it. Pity though, because everything else was good. Those having steak in our team left feeling hungry. Would give this place another shot, but would feedback that the kitchen really needs to work on cooking your steak well, especially if you are going to include it as a 'signature
4
Ordered their lunch set. They served very excellent pan fried fish and fish burger. The portion is good and fulfilling. Ambience is nice and we celebrated one of our friends' birthday there. The Aircon area is with glass roof. It will be a little warm and sunny to go during lunch
3
I detest paying the compulsory 10% service charge when I'm the one getting up asking to be served & another trip inside for the bill. Just because you have large tables inside is a poor excuse. Food is average for the price, more sauce on the sliders would be appreciated. Drinks on coasters would be a step up from paper napkins which are worthless after 5 minutes in Singapore heat

Having visited Dallas restaurant located at the "back" of the Sky Garden @ Suntec Convention Centre several times in the last six months I can highly recommend this stylish and modern restaurant - especially for a business lunch and/or corporate functions. At Dallas, high quality Western cuisine prepared freshly and very tastefully is offered within a sleek yet still very cozy and welcoming ambience. Dallas is featuring both outdoor and indoor dining and bar areas overlooking the Sky Garden @ Suntec on the one side, and the newly built South Beach Hotel and Apartment complex on the other. As a bar and restaurant, Dallas is offering modern city dining experience at it's best - especially when visited at night with the surrounding modern architecture and the Sky Garden lighting creating a truly cosmopolitan ambience. During the day, Dallas is a perfect offer for a business lunch - offering great set executive lunches in a very private setting.Dallas' service staff is generally very friendly and quick to attend to guests needs. The service quality was quite consistent throughout my several visits - no complaints here. The value proposition with respect to the prices charged at Dallas is very good in my opinion - due to the very generous food portions served and the high quality of food and drinks on offer. Nevertheless, the best value is still to be found within the weekday set lunch menu.Dallas Restaurant and Bar in my opinion is a very good option for business lunches and functions or just a nice, relaxing drink overlooking the Sky Garden - if you are in the Suntec area or do do business there. I will certainly return in the future - definitively recommended

We were here not too long ago for a Welcome Dinner organised by our company for some of our event speakers so we had some sit-down menu pre-ordered. pumpkin soup was good but the salad was terrible - and I've always thought it's impossible to get salads wrong. For the main course, I had a taste of the chicken parmigiana and it was awesome! I also tried the fish (pan-fried Barramundi) and it was quite good, too. Though, I prefer the chicken parmigiana between the two. But the portion, OMG, it's really more than sufficient for one person with a considerably good appetite. So for that alone, I think you're getting a chunk of your money's worth.:) Loved the warm chocolate brownie for dessert, too. The restaurant interior is quite neat with the bar at the center and soft lighting. It's not cramped and very well situated, being on top of Suntec and all. Even if you're sitting outside, it's quite breezy and maybe even perfect for that week night catch up with friends or colleagues. Overall dining experience at Dallas that night was in the north of good. Maybe next time the salad would be better.;

We were there for lunch with grandparents and kids on a Sat. Nice place - great view (v bright we needed sunglasses!), foods not bad, but service can be improved. We were not told that kids dine free until we were getting the bill and asked when we saw a sign on the wall. of course by then it was too late to take advantage of the offer. We had to keep asking for water refills throughout the meal. No proactive top ups. We decided that if we needed anything we just had up and get it ourselves
3
Food was OK and service was OK too! No real complaints all was good but nothing out of the ordinary! Just pretty average for the price really!
4
Decent food here, pleasant staff and nice ambiance. We had a deluxe steak burger, salmon salad and baby fiery ribs. Everyone happy.
4
After getting used to Singapore prices, we crossed this little gem during a massive thunder storm.
Lovely restaurant, excellent service, good food and unbelievable prices. Defiantly worth checking out - value for money in a city of over priced eateries 💯
1
I was sorely upset that a restaurant with such a beautiful setting can turn out to be a massively disappointing experience.We were seated promptly, but there after, service was non-existent.Food was served cold, and I mean fridge-cold, more than once.It's impossible to ingest the seriously bad food that was served
4
Dine in solo for my quick bites before my movie, first time I'm dining in here. The view was amazing the layout and ambience was outstanding. As a solo diner I'm alway prefer bar TOP to chill out. I order glass of brut sparkling and two type bar snack ....Nazri the bartender was amazing guy, we had a good chat, the only disappointment was food, Enormous size of food and tasteless dish , they been claims the calamari is there best but I say that was my worst calamari dish I ever eaten. As well the services staff didn't warn me on portion size!!!!!
5
We came to Singapore to hold an event and Dallas Restaurant and Bar came well recommended. Our event was small but terribly important - the team at Dallas understood this and went a long way out of the way to ensure our guests were welcome and left happy and satisfied. We didn't give Dallas a lot of notice, but they responded magnificently. Great catering menu- superb choice and range. Beverage service above average. Best of all- the staff are subtle, unobtrusive and obviously well trained. We had more than a successful event, we had a great time.
1
The food is average while the ambience is great. What's most disappointed to us is the service. The crew recorded our bill wrongly in their system and when I pay for the bill, they simply told me they can't change the order in their system! After insisting they finally called their manager and changed. Overall it's a bad experience. Advice to the restaurant: train your waiters properly
2
The medium rare slow cook steak was not juicy and came across as hard. It's flavour was also wanting. The beef fajita was average because the meat was not good. Service was above average. Avoid coming for lunch, as the glass roof caused my photogrey glasses to darken quite a bit - you are bathed in UV. Overall, not good if you want a succulent steak
3
We went to this bar and restaurant at the top level of the Suntek Shopping Mall in central Singapore and we had cold beers. The humidity in Singapore is overwhelming.This bar was comfortable with good service. The food looked good as well. The WiFi worked brilliantly. What more could you want
4
Had dinner with some friends at Dallas after reading this restaurant from a magazine. Was pleasantly surprised with the view. This was my first time in Suntec Sky Garden. The view was quite amazing. There was a choice of ala carte or set menu. 2 courses for 28++ or 3 courses for 36++. I ordered North Carolina pull burger and my husband and friends had burgers. The portion was large and tasted very good. There were happy hour drinks promotion where you are given one hour free Flow of house pour wines, San Miguel or Stella Artois or soft drinks for 30++. Great for anyone who can drink! We had a great time there
