Very good Mexican food! Nice selection of dishes all of which are tasty and colourful. The restaurant has a good vibe being where it is. Nice drinks and lots of places to go afterwards too!

After the complimentary nachos with salsa, my chicken burrito arrived quickly. It was very full and tasty, it came with some vegetables on the side. My wife and I had a great dinner (without drinks) for about 35S$Last order is 10.30pm, definitely a great option in Holland Village. It has some distance between the loudest bars and the end of the road, so you get to enjoy some very light music without it being a bother (if you plan to chat at a normal volume with the ones joining you). Definitely will be coming back. Fantastic value, good quality and good size. Service was good too

We have tried many mexican restos in singapore and this was definitely one of the best ones. Holland village provides for a great night out with indoor as well as outdoor seating.Veg options were equally good.Fish tacos and chicken quesadillas were delicious. Aqua frescas - guava and mango. Surely recommend
4
Even on a weekday evening, El Patio was almost full ( they don't take reservations except for large groups) when we arrived at 7.30 pm. Service was courteous but slow as they seem to be understaffed. The complimentary corn chips with salsa were well appreciated as we waited for our orders to be taken. We had quesadillas and fajitas, both were good, but not outstanding,Different drinks are offered on a 1 for 1 basis on different weeknights,so I had the Corona beer,but the margaritas are reputed to be very good

We dined here for dinner twice on our last trip to Singapore. All four of us really enjoyed the food options and also the drinks were terrific. To top it all off, Holland Village has a fun, lively vibe to it so great atmosphere for a fun night out.When you are seated, the complimentary salsa and corn chips is a lovely touch and the cold water is much appreciated in the steamy weather. I ordered a Sangria which was top notch. Great flavours and good value at $10 a glass. It was so enjoyable I ordered a second one.The meal sizes were all generous and the ingredients fresh with great flavours. We had been to another Mexican restaurant in Singapore and found it awful so this was such a pleasant experience and a real contrast.Service was a little slow however, the good food and drinks kept everyone happy while waiting.We would definitely travel to Holland Village again and would recommend this restaurant

El patio serves the tastiest sangria!. The restaurant has a great vibe overall. its definitely a place i would go to when I'm craving mexican food. the portions are great value for money. They serve free nachos and salsa while you wait for your meal. There is a variety of food on the menu including non-vegetarian..This is the place to go to if you want to share a relaxing yet delicious meal with friends and family

They were quite busy, but we worked out that it was still only 3 tables per staff member - so not an outrageous feat - or so you would have thought. Took 25 minutes before we were even asked our order, and then when our food was finally served we only received half a meal. We ordered the tofu fajitas, but they didn't come with any tofu. And when we asked whether they had run out of tofu, they told us that it should have tofu... but then did nothing about it, no apology. Zero service - no one asked if our meal was OK, or if we'd like any drinks or deserts. And the majority fo the time the waitresses were just standing there - I just don't get it. We then waited 30 minutes for our plates to be cleared until we just got fed up and asked for the bill... Which took another 10 minutes. And they asked us to sign the receipt and disappeared, but didn't give us a pen? Food was alright, but you basically have to serve yourself if you want a decent evening

Been to quite a number of Mexican restarurant here. Would day the food is good. Portions are reasonable.Tried the Shrimp tacos. Somewhat different and good taste.Would recommend the Lamb Burritos here .Was dissapointed over desserts as they only had only one option. Atmosphere is very good as it's Open air Overall a good place to go for a no fuss meal.

We were attracted with the colourful tables set outside the restaurant. We were there early for dinner and there were few diners already . It does get busier once they close the road up .Anyway food was decent. Fresh Corn chips and salsa was complimentary. We had two mains and a starter, quesadilla, a family favourite.The mains - chicken fajita and lamb burrito were okay. Good sized chicken and lamb in both servings. We did not order any alcohol, but they had some happy hour prices for their margaritas.Service was okay. Overall a nice place to dinner with family and friends
5
This is a must go place for Mexican food taste and good ambiance as well. Particularly their starter menus are really mouth watering.
3
Food is good, service is average, not helpful, not arrendtive and all of them need to learn how to smile. :-(

Located in the Holland Village area, this restaurants offers great beer Can't beat Corona; perfect temperature , perfectly served. Food is another story; mind you Mexico is on the other side of the world! Had some wings , which were absolutely huge - that's not good in this case, not very tasty, lots of seasoning to cover the real taste ☹️. Tacos were ok, but the beef was once again less than well prepared. Service was impeccable and I will come again. Likely for drinks The restaurant seems to be full of families with small kids. Not sure why. It just is. Enjoy
4
Generally speaking this place was very nice. The portions were huge, the food arrived quickly, service was good too, only 4-5 other tables as it was early in the evening tho.Food was very nice, good flavours, we finished 2 mains between 2 and were stuffed! 2 beers and 2 mains (beef burrito and chicken ench.) for around $65, which i consider to be good value, especially in Singapore!Downside is the waitress lady was a bit gruff, hopefully she'd had a long day and isnt always like this. The food also could have been a little hotter, both heat and spice, but it was delicious and I was given hot sauce when I asked so no drama.All in all a good place

Firstly I really wish I had read Trip Advisor before eating at El Patio! The food itself was pretty decent Mexican and fairly good value, we had Fajitas, Tacos, Nachos and Burritos all which everyone enjoyed and the kitchen was flexible in taking things out of dishes for fussy children. The service however was not great, generally the staff looked like they would rather have been somewhere else (which seems to be quite common feedback on TripAdvisor) secondly we were not given/offered kids menus, which I find out from Trip Advisor is a a strong point of the restaurant.... shame
3
I must confess I am Mexican and my criteria trends to be higher when evaluating this restaurant. I order bbq chicken wings which were good tasting. The shrimp tacos were average. Our friends ordered Fajitas with chicken and vegetarian. All of them had a lot of pepper and few meat and other kind of vegetable. The tortillas were made of flour instead of corn. We forgot to ask for the kids' ice cream -included in price- and they did not remind us. The place is well located and safe for kids to play around. If you expect to have a good time it's fine but don't look for traditional Mexican food.
5
The road in front of the restaurant is closed to traffic from 7 pm every night.Bring your kids and their scooters, skates here!Staff Arul is attentive and anticipative !The chips and salsa here are free refills. Kidsmeals are very good value. See image 4thA few shops like 7 eleven and cosmetic shop Sasa are nearby
5
They even do takeaway for the same price.Excellent place, their Mango Margaritas are delicious and the jugs are not super expensive.Their vegetarian options are tasty and plentiful.I would recommend this to anyone wanting something different to the hawker centre but are willing to pay a bit more for it
4
We had the veggie quesadillas and veggie fajitas (excellent amount of choice for vegetarians) and both were delicious! We also had a pitcher of mango margarita which was similarly delicious!Two people with drinks came to $115 which is OK but not an everyday kind of price!I would recommend this place to someone looking a good Mexican. Also great service which is really appreciated compared to many many places in Singapore
5
I went with a group of friends to this restaurant for dinner. The service was good and their staffs are friendly. We ordered afew starters to share and it was very good. The ranchero wings was yummy and I ordered beef enchiladas and I enjoyed it
3
Since it was so busy always we tried
Food is just average and service is good by mgr.
Other than that i felt nothing special..just a visit is k if u wanna try..nothing special..
1
Bad service.Food didn't resemble or taste like any Mexican that I can recall.there a many better options such as buying frozen ingredients from the supermarket and doing your own.The place next door is much better but neither as good at M at Dempsey.Would not recommend.Awful
4
Went here with a friend for lunch. The serve nachos free. Ordered Enchiladas & Burritos and some drinks.
Service was good. Food was hot and nice. Not too spicy. Had a great time. Ambiance was also nice. Will definitely visit again.
4
It's still my preferred Mexican Restaurant compared to others in Singapore. It sure gets busy but is worth the wait for wholesome Mexican cuisine. Nachos are great, keeps you filled and I like my chicken fajita. Huge portions! Good hangouts for friends in Holland Village.
4
The restaurant has surprisingly good Mexican ford for so far from my Arizona and Texas root. The margaritas are also very good. At around six they shut the street and all the restaurant and bar extend along the street. So it's like dinner and drinks at a street party
3
We ate at the Mexican restaurant right next to this one and wasn't impressed with the main dishes. This place have to Q to get the table which I considered that was a good sign. A jug of frozen lime magarita was very good. It just like the other one nearby. All foods that 3 of us ordered wasn't the same result as the drink. Burrito, fajita and enchiladas were all flavorless and a bit stale. For drink only kinda place.

El Patio is tradition whenever my friends and I are back in Singapore because they have the best Mexican food at Holland Village. I usually order the lamb enchiladas but this time around I decided to change it up and have tacos instead, but still with lamb. I was NOT let down! In my opinion, lamb is one of the best meats to have with Mexican food so either way, I think I would have liked it. You have the option of having the tacos in a soft or hard shell, I went with soft, as I thought it was easier to eat! The tacos come served with a side of sour cream, jalapeño chilli dip and a fruit + veg salad. Portion wise, it's quite a bit so for the price you're paying, I would say it's worth it. It really fills you up and if not, the complimentary nachos + salsa they serve you when you're seated can help with that! The meat is cooked fresh on order, so it always tastes delicious and I like that it is also served with fresh vegetable garnishes to balance the spiciness from the jalapeños. This is a great place to come for a dinner with friends or family or a date! The atmosphere is lovely, as it's half outdoors and half indoors. It's quite nice to be seated outdoors in the evening, if it's not raining, to enjoy the cool breeze and soak in the bustling atmosphere of Holland Village! It's also a great place to come for drinks, as they have a different happy hour option available every day of the week, I believe

We were a group of more than 15 people on a Thursday night visiting Holland village. We tried the Mexican joint. It was a good choice. The place has a nice decor. Its quite colourful. The food was very well cooked. We tried many dishes. Personally I tried the Burrito and liked the taste. All the people in our group enjoyed the food. I will visit the place in future. The service was also quick. If you like Mexican food give it a try. There are many options available for vegetarian food lovers.
4
Very flavorful food, love their veggie burrito and quesadilla!Free chips and salsa are great to start with with some drink. The place is quite casual and colorful. Service is decent and smooth most of the time.Place gets quite busy on weekends and you may have to wait for a bit
4
We know this restaurant since at least 15 years and it’s still a very good place for Mexican food. Whether you order the chips with avocado or quesadillas or burritos or fajitas or whatever else they have on the menu, it’s all very good and tasty. The staff is very friendly and they are very easy going with kids. If you are there with kids, they’ll give you all sorts of writing and painting staff for the kids to keep them busy. Besides this, the street in front of the restaurant closes around 6 pm which means kids can run around safely while you enjoy the excellent frozen margaritas.A very good Mexican restaurant to go, highly recommendabl
4
It's not great however it's miles better than cha cha cha and free tortillas are lovely. The service is great
4
Went here with a friend and had a good dinner with nice ambience. Good place to go in the middle of crowded holland village. The foods was tasty and there are a broad options to choose. Not really into mexican food but will sure comeback to this place
4
First taken here by a Mexican friend, which was a good indication! Food is good, filling, and the menu is broad enough to keep you coming back. Free nachos and salsa go down really well with a beer or a margarita while waiting for your food
4
This is a nice wee place to go.....poppers, chicken wings and then followed with some fajitas, wash that down with a couple of coronas and maybe some margaritas and served by some lovely servers, been here a few times and every time it has been spot o
2
I ordered the chicken Taco's, and it was generally okbut ..they clearly were serving cucumber that were rotten. They were soft and some parts were abnormally cut away with the seeds at the center removed. You would only do this if you were trying to hide rotten food.disappointing to say the leas
3
We are a regular visitors to this restaurant and have never had any complaint about the food at all. If not the best its still good....but the staff there is super rude.Bad and cold service is also another thing which we kept on ignoring till now but today when we were told "if someone leaves we will give u a table otherwise we are full" despite having 3 empty tables which none of the service staffs bothered to clear. We kept on waiting for 15 mins and still all the staff members just kept ignoring us and definitely did not bother to clear the vacant tables. We were kind of shocked that how can they do this even when we are regular there and more then that they should have basic courtesy to tell us to wait till they cleared the table. May be they are understaffed and all but all of them seem quite irritated and bored of their jobs and it reflects clearly in their attitude.Sorry to say but the bluntness and coldness of the service staff is just ruining the reputation of this restaurant which serves good food
3
We went to El Patio last night for a change of pace. We felt like Mexican but have to say it was disappointing. The girls that served us were lovely and looked after us but the food was average at best. It was more Tex-Mex than Mexican and not very spicy, even with the hot sauce. We would go back for drinks and a snack but wont be eating dinner there again
4
We thought it'd be good to expose our kids to a different cuisine from what they're used to getting, so we popped over here recently for a weekend family lunch. Interesting Mexican-themed decorations on the walls, with ubiquitous sombreros, and scenes of masked wrestlers, and characters from Dia de Muertos. It was unexpectedly quiet but we figured the restaurant, like most of Holland Village, would be much livelier in the evening. Perhaps an unexpected benefit of being here in the afternoon was that our food arrived fairly quickly.The kids certainly had no complaints about their chicken tacos and quesadillas from the kids' menu, which came with juice and ice cream. The rest of the family had tacos, burritos, and an enchilada, all of which were tasty. We were also happy with the portions, which weren't overwhelmingly large like you sometimes get in North America. Better yet, the prices were reasonable, so overall a fairly successful meal
4
Went there last Saturday with the Missus...left the place after dinner and was walking down HV when the male waiter serving us tapped me on the shoulder and handed back my wallet which I absent mindedly left behind on the table. A big thank you to this gentleman and the restaurant for employing such a decent and honest man....would have been in hot water otherwise- most grateful!!
5
We went few times to el patio in the last 2 months and I would say the food is excellent. You get free tortillas as an entree and then big portions of food. Drinks are special.Although you may experience slow service sometimes bcoz of number of customers, but its great to hang out there. Its holland village so u wont get bored!! Highly recommended
2
The chilli was awful ... The burrito under average, the fajitas just acceptable, the nachos clearly under average.I do not recommend you can eat better Mexican food in any fast food. The only upsides I could say about the restaurant are the resonable service, the pleasant esplanade and the nice house Margerita.
5
Although a bit spoiled by the loud commenting next table occupants, the food was delicious!. We both had hard shell taco's, one with fish and one with chicken. good quality, excellent taste, only not very arm, but that is more or less normal in asia. the drinks came fast and were made to order; sangria and lemon juice. sitting in a big outdoor, under the moon, street restaurant, with such good food, is a pleasure
3
That is all I can say about El Patio. The menu choices were limited to tacos, enchiladas and quesadillas. I'm assuming its more of a bar that happens to offer bar food that is based on the name. The happy hour prices are great, better than any other Mexican restaurant. They also seem to have a good selection of tequilas. Prices for margaritas are better than other restaurants in town. It's very festive and the staff is friendly and helpful. But don't come here if your looking to eat a true tex-mex meal.I gave it average because of the friendly staff and drink prices, food would be a below average in choice and taste
4
We went to El Patio with not too much expectation last night. Good Mexican grub can be hard to find in Singapore and the Holland Village area tends to attract a level of restaurant that is not too 'cuisine focused'.El Patio however is a definite exception to that generalisation and we were very impressed. The service was also first rate and the ambience very cosy and friendly. The menu has a good range and it is very competitively priced. We'll definitely be back
4
During my stay in Holland Village this became my favourite local restaurant to eat at, especially for lunch when it's quiet and you get flawless service. The fajitas, burritos, enchiladas and tacos are all lovely. However I visited one evening and when we finished our meal we waited an age for anyone to take our plates, and after this we waited for ages to be asked if we wanted desert or not, we eventually waited so long we asked to see the menu ourselves. But even then we waited another 10 or so minutes with various members of staff wandering around not getting us the menu before we asked for the bill, which took 30 seconds to arrive. If this had been my first visit I would not return but knowing how good it can be there I did go back and enjoyed the food again. I'd maybe avoid it in the evening but 5 stars for the lunch time service and food
4
When we want the taste of Puerto Vallarta, we go to El Patio - after all, Mexico is almost 24 hrs by flights away. We recently took our Dutch friends to enjoy a lovely lunch. Everything is tasty, and you will also enjoy the service. You will get your food hot and to order. I particularly enjoy the burritos, my Dutch friend raved about the fish tacos. Sangria is just like you want it, too! The only dish that has somewhat disappointed is the Pescado Vera Cruzana. The spicy sauce is delicious, however, they don't use fresh fish, but frozen
5
Have been there almost every month in the last 1 year and every the experience is memorable. Cozy atmosphere and great service. Good place for couples and the Margaritas are out of the world. My wife is in love with this place. A must visit, and don't miss the Margaritas.
4
Have eaten here a few times and will always go back. Good for couples, families, or gatherings. We've taken our kids and they have been very happy! Good service and yummy fresh food! All the food and drinks are good...however, the "Agua de _________" fruit drinks are NOT fresh, but bottled
5
After walking up and down the holland village strip and reading the reviews on here i was sceptical to try el patio. But as sion as we sat down i knew it would be a great dinner. Its clear the attitude ti service has chbaged from when ithers have visuted. All staff were polite, attentive and accomodating. We only waited 2 mins for our drink order which xame out very quick. Food was absolutley brilliant, fresh, tasty and crisp not like some cheap mexican places. Prices were very reasonable $16 fir an enchilada. Go here u eint be dissapointe
4
I go there once a month and I love it! The food is very good: I have tried all the main dishes so far and they are really delicious, especially the Tacos (that you can order in the soft or crunchy version). The service is very good: staff is caring, they fill your glass with fresh water every 10 minutes or less, and at the beginning they provide you with free homemade nachos and a tasty sauce to dip them in (and if you finish them, they will give you again and again!). The location is good because it's in Holland Village; better asking for a table outside
