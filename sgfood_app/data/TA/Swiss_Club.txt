Children swam, played and had a wonderful time. Food was good, an excellent selection. Can recommend the hamburgers with frys & salad. A relaxing atmosphere that adults can enjoy with a glass of wine & children can have fun.

To sit outside swiss club and enjoy the view and the calmness is like a small getaway from.the busy life in SG. The food is good , love the salads and fresh juices. T he kids menue nice with good portions too. Unfortunately the service is mostly quite unorganised. They mixe up or forget your order from time to time. So avoid to be in a rush

We were looking for a venue for our regional management meeting. I considered the usual Orchard Road venues when i coincidently learned about Swiss Club. its set in a beautiful surrounding near Bt Timah, and when you are at the location you forget where you are. "Far" away from construction noise, cars and other disturbing objects. You are really yourself and your team in this event. The staff are super friendly. Swiss hospitality management really shines through. Everyone from the entry guard, cleaners/helpers, receptionists, restaurant staffs, fitness coaches to the GM are very friendly and accommodating. Great venue and highly recommendable for meetings and seminars of groups up to 20 people
