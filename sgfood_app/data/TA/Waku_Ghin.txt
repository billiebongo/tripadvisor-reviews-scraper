Totally outstanding food , a true experience. Dining at its finest. if you want fine dining Japanese style, this is the place.
Jaw dropping seafood , in such creative ways.
5
The standard of the food offering here is exceptional. It is a set menu which ranges across seafood. The meals are prepared in front of you. The wine list is very good. The service is excellent.
There is no better place to eat in Singapore.

We came in a party of 6 for dinner and was seated in one of the four private rooms with a Teppanyaki table setting. Chef was very friendly and knowledgeable. Tried the 10 course meal and if we had to be very critical, we could only find fault with the lobster which we felt the broth was overly tasty that it might have overkilled the natural freshness and original taste of shellfish. Good recommendation for pairing with an excellent sake from Ishikawa Prefecture. The signature Shrimp with Sea Urchin and Caviar was certainly two thumbs up.Services was also excellent except for a mixed up with the drinks. I think the creativity with Japanese (and also Australian) cuisines fusion were superb. Easily an Excellent rating restaurant but the prices charged probably doesn't allow any room for minor let-down

Waku Ghin has delivered all the way on food and service. I made a mistake on the date of the reservation on my calendar and the day before I thought I had a reservation they called me and asked me where I was. Totally my fault, they changed my reservation to the next day, great service.I had the tasting menu (like everybody else) with wine pairing and the food was simply out of this world. My favorite was the Uni and the beef, just amazing. Every dish was masterfully prepared by the chef right there, he answered all my questions but was also very non-intrusive. The service was outstanding... However there was the room next to us with a group of five, yelling and screaming the entire time (except for the smoking breaks they took). It was so loud I had trouble hearing the chef in front of me. I kept complaining and I get the idea that it I hard to compromise between paying customers. The couple next to me moved to the main dining room because it was to loud. I see what the problem I, dealing with an obviously drunk group, however my experience was almost ruined.Waku Ghin is expensive, and the experience should be perfect, that is why I gave them only a very good rating.Dessert is served in the main dining room with a view of the light and water show

Waku Ghin is located within the Marina Bay Sands complex, a massive structure comprised of a hotel, casino, high-end shopping and celebrity chef restaurants. Waku Ghin is the child of Japanese-Australian Chef Testuya Wakuda, whose Sydney-based restaurant has been one of our favourites. Conceptually, Waku Ghin is a semi private dining experience where food is served counter style in several small rooms, ranging in capacity from four to eight diners. There is a fixed price ten course menu that features luxurious seasonal ingredients. The final two courses are served in a larger dining lounge where one can overlook the 8 pm light show that takes place at the adjacent lagoon. This also allows the restaurant more flexibility for their second dinner seating. Now to the food: In generally, the dining experience did not disappoint. The meal started out with tuna belly sashimi, followed by Waku Ghin’s signature dish – uni served in a sea urchin shell with Botan shrimp sashimi and caviar. Heaven in a sea urchin exoskeleton! The third course was also a highlight – perfectly cooked filet of Tachiuo with foie gras and Okinawa spinach served in dashi – a deadly combination. The next three courses were a little bit less successful: the seared Hokkaido scallop was a little on the tough side, albeit tasty, the char grilled spayed open Carabinero shrimp was on the dry side, and the poached lobster could have been more tender (the claw was delicious, but the tail was somewhat chewy). This was made up for by a stunning Wagyu beef dish that melted on the palate, followed by a rice bowl with grilled Wagyu which was quite delicious also. Dessert consisted primarily of a chocolate mousse cake – it tasted good, but came across as short on creativity. Service was impeccable, and the wine list was large and ranged from reasonably priced wines to a 58,000 $ bottle of something that I can’t remember and would never order, even if I had the cash.Altogether, we had a lovely evening at Waku Ghin. I would rate the food somewhere between four or five stars, but given the price of the meal at close to 500 $ Can per person, one should reasonably be able to expect perfection – and perfect it was not

Everything is in the title... Good products for sure, but almost no work on them, same menu since day one, those small "Teppanyaki rooms" where the Teppanyaki is almost not used, but the exhaust noise above your head is working well, maybe to break the ice cold ambiance in this restaurant. Nothing that my palate will remember. But a paradise for all the people who eat with their eyes (and mostly social network junky).The only thing I will not forget, is the bill..

Went to Waku Ghin on first time visit to Singapore, persuaded in part by TripAdvisor reviews. Were not disappointed. This place is VERY expensive (e.g. more than Alinea in Chicago!), and situated above a large casino in the flashy Marina Bay Sands complex- never a good sign.Nevertheless, the meal soared above expectations, the best Japanese cuisine we've ever experienced (note: never visited Japan itself). Among the standout items:1) the signature dish (pictured), a savory medley of tender raw shrimp, succulent, sweet uni and caviar. To die for delicious2) the abalone, steamed on the griddle on a bed of sea salt (!), and covered with lemon slices and seaweed, then served in its shell with a savory seaweed sauce- earthy, complex and delicate flavor.3) the lobster, slow cooked in a delicious spicy Asian sauce4) tiny chocolate mousse cake, with a tiny garland of gold leaf, intense, tart and sweet.The young chef who cooked our seafood, in a small private room shared with two other couples, was friendly, skillful, gracious and humble. The service was exceptional, not overbearing, but attentive and thoughtful. We had an amazing meal at Waku Ghin and recommend to Singapore travelers without hesitation.

This is definitely a bucket list experience. You feel like royalty from the moment you check in and the evening just keeps getting better as the night wears on. The food is incredible and the staff really help keep the drama alive - making time to show you the fresh produce and describe it and allow time for photos. We also added in the matching wines and we are so glad that we did - it just completed the experience beautifully. The completion of the meal in another area of the restaurant was a gorgeous finale
5
Visited the bar and had a la carte menu. It was a totally different experience! You cannot have this great Japanese cuisine even if your are in Japan. The service was perfect! At the end, we had beautiful desserts like gems. Certainly I will try what they have at the main table next time in the near future. Worth visiting Singapore for only having dinner here

Extremely disappointed – as someone who had enjoyed Tetsuya’s food for decades from his early days at Rozelle, it was a total letdown. Of the many meals we have had at Tetsuya’s this wouldn’t rank in the top 50.The rating reflects more the $ charged and the lack of meeting expectations – the food had a certain quality but not to be compared with Andre, Nouri, Odette’s, Blackwattle etc. where we had dined the previous few days.It’s not though that we created these expectations, they promote Tetsuya Wakuda extensively and you naturally make some assumptions.As the Marina Bay Sands says “With its long list of awards, Waku Ghin is universally acclaimed as one of the very best restaurants in Singapore. Tetsuya Wakuda’s masterful European Japanese dishes are created in front of diners’ eyes by personal chefs for an unmatched fine dining experience”I’ve eaten at so many of the world’s best Chefs Tables in the past couple of years and this doesn’t compare.Typically, the chef does everything in front of you from showing the produce, to preparation, then cooking and presentation to the diner – all the while involving the diner and discussing what he is doing.At Waku Ghin, not only was the chef relatively young (and by comparison to Tetsuya, inexperienced) but he rarely talked and seemed almost embarrassed being asked questions.There was no interaction and no involvement that perhaps would have made it worth half the money.The dishes were not created in front of us, the preparation was done in an outside kitchen and then brought to the bench in front of us where the young chef played and then served without communication.In our home town, have enjoyed Raita where all my expectations have been met at less than half the price and the seafood has been even fresher.Tetsuya should be embarrassed – the final insult was the finishing touch of giving my wife a fruit jelly

We went to this restaurant not long after it had opened. While it is expensive it is the most amazing dining experience we have ever had. Food was totally different from most other restaurants but absolutely beautifully presented and had the best flavour ever.
5
From the start - cocktails, to the end - dessert, I was amazed by the amazing service, the freshness of ingredients, the ambiance and creativity. Take my money! Will be back here again
5
This visit was in the making for quite a few years and it did not disappoint. Over four hours, we were taken through a food journey like no other. It was not just about the food, but the making memory that was formed. We were all treated to food, drinks and service of the highest quality. I would find it hard to top this experience and would recommend it if you were planning an unforgettable night

We decided to splurge on Waku Gin with a family member one Friday evening. Being from Sydney and having all eaten at Tetsuya, we were interested to see whether the S$400+++ per person menu was worth it. The restaurant is located in the celebrity dining area above the casino. Waku Gin is nothing like Tetsuya. The restaurant only seats a small number of guests at each of the two sittings each night in rooms of approximately five. When we arrived (prior to any other guests) we were escorted to an area where we could have a pre dinner drink. We were then shown into our room where we were served our first eight courses. The guests at the earlier sitting were a mainly tourists from Asia but there were a few more local guests. The staff firstly showed us a box of examples of the type of seafood we would be eating. Most of the menu is seafood with two beef courses. The seafood came from around the world including Canada. We were then served some entrees including sashimi and their specialty uni and caviar dish. The chefs then started to cook in front of us the various seafood dishes which included braised lobster, abalone, and fish. We also then had two courses of beef (one Australian and one Japanese wagyu beef), rice soup with snapper, then moved to the main dining room for dessert. Dessert included cake and petit fours. Overall the service was very attentive and polite. The food was very fresh - the freshness of the food was the real attraction. However the restaurant felt a bit cold and soulless ... maybe because of the layout and being quite dark. It was a nice experience however we were honestly a bit disappointed that it wasn't a bit more special and distinctive. Being so expensive in Singapore, we had expected better. The restaurant seemed to lack somewhat a bit of personality.
4
We came here again with family who were in town. The menu changes by the season and the choices were interesting, though we were happy the singature dish of uni was still the same. There was a lobster bisque-like dish which was delicious and I wanted to soak up the last bits with a bit of bread, but the bread was stale and rubbery. I couldn't believe it. I love this restaurant but I was really disappointed by the stale bread, simple thing but at this price point everything should be great and this was a big fail for me. Otherwise the rest was great and the sommelier was excellent, but since our first visit two years ago, I feel the quality has declined just a bit
5
Although we only walked in for the bar dinner rather than the restaurant dinner, we were treated as special guests.Food and wine are fabulous and the wagu beef amazing.We were fortunate that Tetsuya the owner was there and he generously spent some time with us. Next trip will definitely be the full experience. Decor was amazing with wonderful pottery from an Australian artist on display. Truly deserving of the Michelin award

The online thesaurus has 38 synonyms for Delicious, 44 for Remarkable ... I'm going to have try hard not to use them all in this review. This is 6 star dining in city spoilt with 5 star food.The menu is fixed, with seasonal updates occurring around an iconic heart of signature dishes.As an example, the Marinated prawn, sea urchin and caviar is nothing short of perfection. Sitting at the 8 seater teppanyaki counter those who had never tasted it sighed in surprise and delight, while those who'd enjoyed the pleasure before looked at their friends and cheered in delight, wistfully remembering the ecstasy of their own first time.Having been twice now, the impact of such a light but flavorful, richly salted, sweet and sour balanced dish isn't lost, even a note, the second time. I've not eaten a seafood dish as good in my life.This is a statement I must have made 5 or 6 times on my first visit no meter the dish - vegetables, rice and beef. A charming young sommelier guided us through the world of sake, and after a fascinating beginners introduction we settled on one of the houses own sakes, created in partnership with an artisanal brewer in Japan. This was delicious and much like a good wine with European cuisine, enhanced our meal even further.The dishes flow like ambrosia. One plate of perfection after the next. Strangers sitting along the counter all now firm friends, bonded through whimpers of pure pleasure.As dinner finished and we praised our chef, we were led to a lounge for desert. Delicate chocolates, a light aperitif, and a slice of the best melon I've ever had! I know this sounds ridiculous, but in a menu that consisted of the mind blowing and better, this humble melon deserves a mention. It just goes to show that a manic obsession with sourcing, respecting and preparing the very best can transcend food to heavenly places.Your going to pay handsomely for this euphoric meal, and it is worth every single penny. You'll leave feeling like something has changed in your life, something wonderful and for the better.

I've been eyeing this restaurant for so long from IG posts. When I had a chance to visit Singapore I booked one month in advance to secure my spot. I went solo as none of my friends were able to justify the price. In my opinion, you live once, you have to try it! The dinning experience was so unique, this is my first time in a very fine dinning restaurant and I must admit I was not sure what to expect but I know that it should be worth the money! Service was impeccable and the food was, unique and of great quality, everything was so delightful from start to finish! I love the privacy of the experience, I was with 2 other couples and really like the interaction of the chef cooking in front of you and the waitress that seems to pop out of no where whenever you need refill, serving and when you finish your dishes. I hardly have to lift a finger, only there to eat, eat and eat!! I would actually do it again in the future if I had a chance to go back to Singapore, just hope their menu change daily as I wouldn't want to go back to eat the exact same thing again, this is of course due to the price of the set menu. Though their signature Marinated Botan Shrimp with Sea Urchin and Oscietra Caviar can stay
5
Waku Ghin is a must visit for any serious foodie. A very enjoyable dinner with the freshest produce and excellent service. Especially enjoyed the botan shrimp with sea urchin, the restaurant's speciality. I've had the privilege of meeting Chef Tetsuya at another function and he is by far one of the warmest and most humble celebrity chef I've met. Kudos to him for flying his flag high in Singapore!
5
We are foodies and just completed a trip to Singapore and HongKong with a combined 12 Michelin stars. Waku Ghin for us was the most pleasing experience overall - and we had a lot of fun on our trip! What was so outstanding about it?- it's like having a personal chef prepare your meal right in front of you, interact with you, and explain interesting tidbits - outstanding dishes!! I agree with the other TA reviews - the Uni, Shrimp, and Caviar (lots of Caviar) signature dish just blows the taste buds into heaven! The abalone was just amazing (and I am not usually a fan);- Sake & wine pairing; we are picky with our wines after some other eateries' tasting menus we're trying to be too smart by half; but the sommelier perfectly adjusted the wine selection and we tried 3 deep Sake tastes; and 3 wines plus champagne. Generous portions. Well paired!!- a huge amount of food AND Sake/wine ... actually it was too much food quantity for my spouse, and left even me trying to find more space in my stomach- a serene interplay between the bar, culinary, experience, and architecture. They really thought this through. The one downer: when leaving after a fabulously satisfying evening, the door of Waku Ghin lets you out on a balcony overlooking a gigantic casino - that was an unfortunate counterpointAll in all, Waku Ghin beat out other, more highly rated establishments in our experience.
5
Simply outstanding.
An incredible experience, the best restaurant we have dined in and that includes 2 & 3 Star Michelin.
5
Not sure what to write, this is a culinary experience on a whole different level! All the dishes are prepared in front of you in a private room, so no distractions from other tables.
A must go for any serious food lover!
5
Everything was just so perfect .. from the meet and greet all the way to the farewell .. and of course the Japanese cuisine at another level all together .. a unique experience like no other .. guaranteed ..
5
I would recommend if celebrating any occasion with loved ones, this is quite a place to consider but price is really high, service is good though.
5
From entry to exit the service were impeccable. One of the best dining experiences ever! Best dish was definitely their signature sea urchin dish! Price tag of over $500 per person means its definitely a once in a lifetime experience. Looking forward to trying out Tetsuya's in Sydney
5
Very personal service. SGD450++ tasting menu is the best I've ever had & worth every dollar. Very beautiful presentation & extremely tasty dishes. Had wine and sake pairing at SGD250++ which covers 8 different types. Loved the sake, didn't fancy the whites so much and liked 1 of the 2 reds, but all personal preferences. Extremely good desserts as well! Deserves Michelin Star!

"They say better say nothing if you don't have something nice to say."Well I would like to say that Waku Ghin was a lovely experience. In that the food and service were impeccable. My objection is with a few others things though. The food with matching wine was $700pp so that was what I thought we would be paying at the very most - I was wrong. We were asked if we wanted a pre dinner drink before being asked if we wanted the matching wine option - a bit naughty considering that my husband and I both ordered a glass of champagne (which I think we were charged close to $100 per glass). Secondly they offered a truffle dish in addition to what they had on the menu, that too was approximately $100. Finally there was an expectation for a tip to be given - not happy about that either. We ended up forking out $1,800 for 2 for one very special night out. It was good - but my advice would be if you are inclined spend that sort of money fly to Sydney and eat at his restaurant there. So much better in every which way imaginable.
5
Let's be honest - Waku Ghin is an expensive restaurant! But if you can afford it, I would recommend to go. It has a set menu and you can pay extra to get dishes with truffles. You will sit in a chef table and food will be made and prepared in front of your eyes. Which I always love to see as it's such a fine art in my opinion. We didn't order any wine there as we wanted to try some good sake, as its a fine Japanese restaurant. The sommelier recommended one sake and we loved it - one of the best we've ever tried
5
The setting, level 2 of the ultra posh Marina Bay Sands mall and casino, is understated, chic elegance. As you approach the doors two attendants open them and bid you into a dark, slick bat/ lounge area where if you've arrived ahead of that pointed time for one of the two set mealtimes, you can indulge in incredible cocktail or mock tail and if tempted try a French oyster or two. Advice: do the cocktail and defer on the oyster... over the next three hours or so you are going to eat some of the finest (Japanese) or otherwise food on the planet.You sit in a private room at a Omakase style bar with just six people. Your chef starts with a presentation of the raw seafood ( the Canadian lobsters we're still moving) that will be incorporated into your meal... don't worry there will alsobemear courses: in our case Ohmi Wagyu and Tasmanian Grass fed beef. Do opt for a sake to accompany your meal....it's a rare selection that you won't find anywhere else. Our dinner consisted of 9 courses including abalone and marinated botan shrimp with sea urchin and Oscietra caviar. Terrific selection of wines available by the glass or bottle. Once dinner is complete you move to a lounge overlooking the harbor for light dessert and beverage of your choice. Amazing desserts!It is not cheap, but from start to finish you are treated as royalty and most likely eat better than most royals. DO make an advance reservation, and unless you are a night owl, the 5:30 seating is ideal. We left at 9:00
5
It was a special occasion for us and so we splurged on this evening - 9-course dinner with 3 other desserts. Every dish was fantastic. Needless to say, their signature dish of sea urchin, caviar and shrimp was perfectly balanced and fresh. But for me, the best dish was the grilled abalone. I have never had abalone like that, and it was perfectly cooked. I don't want to comment on every single dish. But two general comments. (1) The sauces that they made to match every course were creative and amazing. (2) The attention to detail and the "show" part of cooking was memorable. Our chef was a young man but so well-trained and knowledgeable that it was a great conversation the whole meal through. It is hard for me to imagine how this place cannot earn at least 2 Michelen stars.
5
The variety of dishes offered by the place is phenomenal. Every restaurant should learn how the food should be cooked and served. The good things come at a price so be ready to sacrifice your wallet there :-)
4
Great ambience, great food, great service...... Except for that price, I could get much more than what I get in many Japanese restaurants in Japan.
It is still recommended as it is one of the better Japanese restaurants in Singapore.
4
It was a treat to dine at Waku Ghin given its rave reviews and the overall experience was memorable. The quality of the food and produce was first rate- lobster, sea urchin, caviar, wagyu and abalone. The best dish was undoubtedly the botan shrimp with caviar- a unique creation bursting with umami and very refreshing. The abalone however didn't quite cut it, tasting rather bland and falling short in texture. I very much preferred the accompaniment to the abalone as opposed to the abalone itself. Overall it was a pleasant experience and worth checking out. On another note, it was a pleasure meeting with Chef Tetsuya at Savour. One of the humblest and nicest chefs I'ce met despite his fame.
5
This restaurant is a bit hard to find but if you do, this will be one of the best experience of your life. Enjoyed a 10-course dinner. We had a table in front of the cooking plate and could observe how meticulous and professional they are. All dishes were absolutely delicious and what was striking was the quality of their products: as fresh as if it has just come out of the water. Great wine, great sake, one of the best meals ever in my life. Very expensive though
5
There is a tendency with expensive, top flight restaurants for snobby reviewers to pretend the food is only so-so. No question it is expensive, too expensive in comparison to some other meals we've spent $1k and above on (Atelier Crenn and E by Andres come to mind immediately), but several of the dishes were phenomenal. The cost, I'm certain, is due to the quality of the ingredients, none of which come cheap.With 10 courses, we passed on the wine pairing, which we almost never do, but we worried about the noted 8 pours in 10 courses, and they wouldn't let us share a tasting. We opted for two glasses each, and all the by the glass choices were high quality, among the best in the world.1) Hanadai - fantastic sushi dish to start off the tasting.2) Waku Ghin's signature dish - marinated shrimp with sea urchin and caviar. Hard to go wrong with these ingredients, and it was as good as advertised.3) Seared amadai w/mushrooms, another solid dish.4) Special - it's white truffle season! A generous portion (to match the sky high price) of white alba truffles went over a potato puree with a poached egg and caviar. The highlight of the evening for both my wife and I.5) Steamed king crab - great show, steamed over a mound of salt, with a lime sauce that created the best crab dish I've ever had.6) Abalone - this was the one miss. The abalone at French Laundry was unbelievable - best I've ever had, and Waku Ghin's was tough and unpleasant - a disappointing dish.7) Lobster - braised slowly in front of us while the previous two dishes were cooked. Very tasty, but not as flavorful as I expected.8) Wagyu w/wasabi. With these ingredients, you can't go wrong, and it was phenomenal.9) Steamed rice consommÃ© - an incredibly elevated play on miso soup - a highlight for me.10) Traditional japanese green tea - a very pleasant end to the savory courses.11) Honey ice cream w/lemon granita, very tasty.12) my wife got what she said was the best rice pudding she's ever had, and my chocolate mousse was solid.Overall, a phenomenal meal in a fun teppan setting. It's hard to meet sky high expectations, but while I'd like the price to have been less, the crab, sea urchin, and wagyu were world class dishes

Went to Waku Ghin with high expectations. With the dinner menu priced at $450++ and wines being heavily marked up, you are going to spend at least $1.5K for a couple, so naturally you would expect a wow. But it was not the case, as the majority of the food courses were decent but not outstanding. Service was superb and almost impeccable, except that the upselling efforts by the staff were on the heavy side. Ambiance is pleasant. Decor is first class. Wine list is excellent. Conclusion. Waku Ghin has failed to impress us: indeed it is a decent establishment, but there is a number of restaurants in Singapore offering even better food while being much more affordable
5
Each course and its matched wine was a building crescendo of taste fantasies. on reflection, there were personal preferences - different for each patron - but the pathway remained as tantalising as the crumb chase of Hansel and Gretel , until the very last vestige.As good as the best - anywhere
5
We dined here as a couple and everything was just perfect. I loved the intimacy of just two couples in the room watching the chef work his magic. The 10 dishes were fantastic, particularly the marinated Botan shrimp with sea urchin and caviar. Great ambiance and really just fine dining at its best. Highly recommended
5
I was dying for a gastronomic dinner after a dry period of the last few months and some poor restaurant experiences. So I was really looking forward to this and it did not let me down. The menu was as decadent as it can be. From caviar, foie gras, uni, scallop, abalone, fatty tuna, A5 Wagyu and several other usual suspects to the introduction of new ingredients I had never come across before like sea grass, large botan shrimp etc this menu was a compliation of the biggest hits in the food world. I have had a similar experience in Robuchon before but whereas Robuchon was more show-off style and not much good mix of flavours, at Waku Ghin everything was like a journey of flavours and each distinct to each other. The staff were great with attention to detail and style of service. Can only expect this from a Japanese chef. I dont know how they do it but its heartwarming experience. Bravo, needless to say I would only recommend this to whoever can afford it. Its is $660 per person including a couple of drinks
5
The omakaze here is excellent, it's fixed set menu and the portions will blow your stomach away. Food is fresh, the signature dish is the uni with shrimps. I personally like the lobster bisque kind of dish and the beef as well. I can't describe anymore how good the dishes are until you try it. Reservation is a must and if you have to book weeks in advance with credit card being charged first, it's very normal.
3
Nothing to shout about.....food was alright, not fantastic. Over rated & overpriced!!!! There are many other restaurants in Singapore that are a lot better. If you want to experience some extra-ordinary culinary delight, don't waste your money on this one.
5
We had the incredible privilege of having a private chef in a private room, and the dinner was a delight from start to end.
5
Amazing restaurant. The food is very delicious. At the end, they give you a paper where it shows everything that we have ate. The service is very nice and friendly.
1
What’s all the fuss about? Nothing special. In fact for these prices (one of the most expensive restaurants in Singapore) it was profoundly disappointing. They appeared to be doing things to win them Michelin stars and to impress rather than make interesting and tasty food and be sincere. There wasn’t a single dish which stood out on my fish/meat menu and the person I was with's vegetarian one. There are better Japanese restaurants at Pan Pacific and even Kinki beats it. Not worth the money, wine was exceedingly overpriced even for Singapore and the whole experience wasn’t especially enjoyable. Felt forced and insincere
5
Food is just out of this world. Thoughtful and skilful use of condiments and garnishes to bring out the flavours in the freshest ingredients - makes you realise great food is just that simple. Impeccable service and one of the widest selection of sake just adds on to the whole wonderful dining experience. Definitely worth more than the one star it's been given by Michelin
3
After the dinner three months ago, I was still not in a position to answer the question above, because the ingredients are all high-end, the venue is exclusive but the culinary skills? Honestly I can't tell. I can't even recall any memorable dishes any more ..
4
Enjoyed our dinner at Waku Ghin. Started at 530pm and ended just before 8. Food gets served pretty quickly which was even better for me since I get reallyimpatient waiting. Don't think that they are too strict with dress code as the couple next to us wore tshirt, jeans and sneakers. Very meticulous team, they give you a copy of their menu after your meal and I was very surprised that they edited the title of my second dish (I'm allergic to raw crustaceans so I didn't have raw shrimps with my uni). They charge a bit differently for water, instead of charging per bottle they go by $20 per person for still water (so drink more guys haha)! In terms of taste, above average, but I'm giving the experience 4/5 as the price of the meal was on par with the ingredients used (uni, tuna, king crab, lobster, abalone, wagyu) - very worth it
5
This is what food should be all about. No fancy cooking, just pure, fresh ingredients with the clever use of condiments and garnishes to bring out or enhance the flavours. The selection of sake is also second to none. You just get the impression that the owner and everybody who works here knows food, knows what they're doing and are passionate about it
5
Tepanyaki style in MBS. Always pleasure to come back and never feel like being in the casino as you got into the restaurant. Very cozy and well received. Food for each courses were delicate with the young chef and even its not as good as the authentic one in Japan but it's another great place to visit. Good selection of Sake and wine lists but too much mark up on wine lists.
5
A truly unique dining experience. This restaurant has it all. Classy yet sobre interior decor. Fantastic service. Sublime food.Great desert room with Armagnacs by Darroze made specially for the restaurant and chef Tetsuya and depending on your timing, a front seat to the great MBS laser light show on every evening! From the moment you walk in you are taken care of and subjected to the Waku Ghin experience which is, to say the least, amazing and wonderful. They serve a 10 course tasting menu with emphasis on seafood. This is the most special of "special places" and was one of my most (if not THE most) memorable dining experiences. If you pocketbook can afford it (perfection does not come cheap!) it is money well spent for a special experience. Thank you to the entire Wahu Ghin team for a great time last night and to chef Tetsuya! Oh and when you leave, you are handed a memento-- a menu of what you have. Classy to the end
5
Unbelievably good food in a friendly atmosphere. Excellent ingredients perfectly prepared. Forget your classic tepan experiences for a totally reinvented cooking discovery. From sea urchins with caviar to perfectly stemmed lobster, every dish was incentive and perfectly realized.
5
Still one of the best restaurants on the planet ... Food, atmosphere and attention by staff is fantastic .. A must on your dinning experience list
5
Well all I can say is that we had a truly amazing and wonderful experience at Waku GhinFrom the time you set foot into this establishment you immediately know that you are going to be well looked afterThe service staff are amazing with every detail taken care off with smiles all around making you feel comfortable and welcomeThe freshness of the ingredients used are by far the very best and of high qualityThe preparation and cooking of these ingredients where on show in front of our eyes as we where left in oar on how the flavours married together and left a gastronomic explosion of taste and flavour on our taste budsA huge THANKYOU to Chef Suzuki for a fantastic and amazing experience

We planned our entire Singapore travel schedule around our Waku Ghin reservation and there was definitely a huge build up to it.. Lucky for us, Waku Ghin didn't disappoint and it was certainly a meal of a lifetime. Service was impeccable, the seafood as fresh as can be, and the flavour combinations simply outstanding

My son and I have the same birth date and wifey kindly booked Waku Ghin for the dinner celebrations. This is my second time there. Our first time was about 7 years ago and we were lucky that Chef Tetsuya was there too for the F1 weekend. Food was of a very high quality and the seafood was as fresh as you can get, though pricings have gone up - degustation was SGD 450 pp and wine pairing SGD 250. The highlight was the uni/caviar/prawn combo for me. Most of the items were similar to the previous time.Desert was at another area with a nice view overlooking the Marina Bay. If you have a special occasion to celebrate and willing to spend, Waku Ghin is a nice place to enjoy Marina Bay Sands

An evening to remember. We arrived early to enjoy a cocktail at the bar. Both of us let the barman design a drink around a single ingredients- sake for me, which resulted into a delightfully surprising result. We had a lovely chat with the sommelier around their wine list and were finally taken to our salon, sitting down at a bar in front of the cooking teppan. Followed 10 dishes that were all delicious, great ingredients, fantastic cooking and seasoning, very decent portions (how can one get out of the place feeling hungry as I read in some reviews is a mystery to me). I even enjoyed abalon, which I usually don't like. Great wine list too.The only slight area of improvement - the staff si sometimes so passionnate that they come a little too often to ask about the dishes and discuss, which may interrupt conversations. This is all with the best of intentions though

Being Asia's #6 best restaurant carries a lot of weight and burden as expectations would be high. To start with the decor and ambience in pleasant and relaxing. Nothing to complain about. The service is exceptional. The waiters are attentive, pleasant and professional. I would give the service 10/10. Now to deal with the food which is the most important element in a restaurant. The dishes are genuine and creative. May by not as one would expect from one of the best restaurants in the world but still there is thought and effort behind the dishes. The taste is good. Some dishes such as the King Crab and the Wagyu Beef were creative as well as tasty. Others were just good, nothing exceptional.

The Sea Urchin and Caviar is a must for foodies. I would recommend showing up a bit early for your reservation as I really enjoyed watching the Marina Bay Sands casino just before entering into Waku Ghin. No cameras while watching the casino players, but it was a very interesting sight to see. Staff a Waku Ghin are exceptionally well trained, and sophisticated. For Mandarine speaking guests they have very elegant staff who can explain each dish in Mandarine. Service is what one should expect of a world ranked top 50 restaurant, attentive, with wonderful presentation. We opted for the wine pairing and the full menu. The wine pairing was very clever and went well with all of the dishes. I would recommend for the full menu doing the first seating. For us it was timed well to watch the Marina Bay Sands water show while having desert from the scenic Waku Ghin tea room. A very high end private experience

Probably one of the best degustations I have ever had.Wasn't exactly creative, but the effort that goes into the freshness, preparation was phenomenal.The signature uni with caviar and shrimp was a fantastic blend of flavours. The seafood broth with rice was so clear and refreshing....absolute delight.The service was impeccable. Mood, ambience was great.Have to go

The best Omasake dinner I’ve had! It’s true that it is costly (400+ per pax) but then again, for the experience as special as this…it’s all worth it ☺ To start with, the service you’ll enjoy is very exclusive. Together with 4 friends, we had our own private dining room… own Chef and Sous-Chef that took extra good care of us all through out the night plus army of staffs that treated us like we are the most important people in the world! We started with cocktails. Very interesting cocktails that I never had anywhere else but there… Then we were escorted to our private dining room. The chef took time explaining the 10-course meal he prepared for us. Every detail of the 10 beautifully presented dishes has been kind of whispered to us while we were enjoying them. Except for the main dish which we were asked to decide on (based on the menu), all the rests were the Chef’s choice. There’s of course over flowing sake that accompanied our sumptous meal. And for the finale - we were once again escorted to the main room where all the guests are directed for the much-awaited dessert. Well you can already guess by now that we’ve once again served with nothing but the best. The one thing stuck in my head is the “black forest” that looked nothing like the usual. There are only 4 private dining rooms and 1 dessert room. So it is a must to call in advance and reserve. If you’re reading this, you must be really considering Waku Ghin ☺ I’d say first that am jealous! Second, you won’t be disappointed. Enjoy

one of the best restaurants I've eaten in!
the dishes of the set menu complemented each other very well, cocktails were interesting
service very professional

If you are a foodie and have the opportunity to splurge, Waku Ghin is one of the finest venue with a luxurious culinary experience to offer.Setting aside the difficulties we had navigating our way around Marina Bay Sands to find the restaurant, the whole dining experience really started as soon as you walk in the door.Service and Experience: Awesome. I love how there is a "private" room where it is simply you and the chef as he cooked the dishes in front of us. It's not a teppanyaki bar so do not fear having any eggs being thrown at you. ;)Meal: Exclusively exquisite. There are no other place to taste the dishes.Price: $1000+ for two and it was worth it.Notes: If you are allergic to seafood or if you (or your date) is picky with food, I certainly would have to suggest you think twice about going as you may not find it enjoyable in many levels

With the Michelin guide coming to Singapore, I figured we should try this restaurant while we could still get tables. I had trouble with paying this much food for essentially minimally cooked ingredients. After receiving my Visa statement, I still don't think this was worth it but I am glad I tried it. The restaurant is beautiful. You are seated at individual stations with maximum 8 guests. I found it strange that they were so insistent on us arriving on time as the whole room eats together and yet a couple arrived about 45 minutes into our meal and had an abbreviated version of our dinner. It was off-putting simply because they were SO annoying about the time issue beforehand. The food was good but because it is seasonal, you have no say in what you eat. Therefore instead of the salt smoked Alaskan king crab (which I can also get at home but is still a treat), we were served Atlantic lobster, which I grew up eating fresh out of the sea every summer. Needless to say, no matter how fresh it was before it got on the plane, it's not going to taste as good as in Canada. The signature dish was very tasty. Unlike my expectations, there is some sort of marinade (the chef confirmed it) to the shrimp so it is not just a pile of raw ingredients as some critics have suggested. Dessert is served in a lounge with a view and was very nice French style chocolates and cakes. Was it worth $1700 for 2 people? I don't think so, but I'm glad I tried it

Waku Ghin is a unique dining experience, well worth adding to your culinary destinations list. Seated in groups of 6 in front of a Teppanyaki-style arrangement, our food journey for each dish began as the chef cooked most dishes right in front of us with prepared produce and ingredients.While this final stage of cooking looked easy and effortless, don't be fooled! The real effort towards each dish is done out of eye and likely before you woke up that morning!Dishes are all deceptively simple and designed to hero a particular ingredient - mostly a seafood.We were impressed with every course. All were complex, elegant and simple. The wine list was extensive and we were guided by the somms with ease. We later toured the impressive wine cellar and chatted with he somms until we were the last patrons to leave.Brilliant 5-star dining

If you are looking for a more unique, personalised fine dining experience - this would be it (at a great financial cost).The food was delicious and cannot be faulted by any account. The waitstaff and chef asked if we had any dietary requirements and would tailor the menu accordingly if we did have any. We didn't and was blessed to experience the wide variety of fresh seafood that this restaurant featured. For me, the most outstanding dish was their signature marinated Botan shrimp with Sea urchin and Oscietra caviar (don't have a separate picture unfortunately) and for my partner, the lobster (see picture below) was a standout. We both agreed that the Wagyu was the best that we've tasted (picture also below).My expectation was that there would only be one chef's table that seated 10 - 12 people, but they actually have 4 rooms, each with their (teppanyaki-style) grill. Although that did not impact the excellent service in any way, I didn't expect there to be multiple chefs serving multiple tables. Perhaps if you are considering going here, go with friends or family that fill up one room (our room would seat 6 people) so service and your experience is seamless, i.e. not impacted by your neighbouring diners.For me, this restaurant is a once in a lifetime experience as it is very expensive, and in Singapore there's also a 10% service charge and a 7% tax on top of the bill. I would consider it one of the most expensive restaurants in the world, and would cost at least approximately SGP$500 per person. If you add drinks, it can easily be more than that.Price aside, the food, service and restaurant is definitely 10/10, I highly recommend you try it if you are considering it

By far the best dinning experience ever! We reluctantly passed through Singapore on our way to the Maldives (now we wish we'd stayed longer). Back to Waku Ghin... we enjoyed a private dining experience, with our own chef who cooked approx a dozen tasting dishes in front of us throughout the night. Each dish was presented impeccably and tasted even better then they looked! From the hand crafted ice dome in my husband's scotch, to the fresh ingredients used through out, this was an experience of a life time. The staff were extremely professional and our chef was wonderfully polite, we thoroughly enjoyed conversing with him through out the night. For dessert we were moved to a large open dinning room, with views spanning across the bay, allowing us to enjoy the 'Wonder Full' light and laser show in seclusion. As we left, the chef basically chased us out of the restaurant to personally say goodbye. The evening cost us approx $1,300 (AUD) for the two of us but in my opinion it was worth every cent. Not every dining experience here would cost the same, however we did enjoy some great wine & scotch with our food. Despite Singapore exceeding all our expectations, I've said many times that I would go back to Singapore just to eat here again, so much so, we are planning a trip next month! I can't wait

As huge fans and regular patrons of Tetsuyas in Sydney, we were keen to visit the sister restaurant in Singapore and were not disappointed. With only 25 diners per night, it certainly makes it expensive but gives the opportunity for a unique experience. In our own room with 5 diners, we were highly entertained by our chef who prepared each course in front of us. Our Japanese chef had worked in Sydney for some years and had excellent English. The food and ingredients were stunning and as expected, the service was impeccable. Moving to the Dessert Room is a wonderful conclusion to a perfect evening

This is certainly the most expensive restaurant I've tried so far, by quite a wide margin. Is it worth it? Perhaps....after all, the dishes did feature all the premium ingredients - truffles, caviar, lobster, wagyu beef... There's hardly a weak dish (for me it was the abalone, which was rather rubbery). Even the simplest-looking dish like a bowl of cold japanese noodle can be impressive.And of course you pay for the showmanship, as many of the dishes are cooked right in front of you. All the staff were professional and informative, including the Japanese chef in our room who explained each dish (he spoke excellent English). Drinks were very expensive (water for S$ 20++ !), and even having a glass of cocktail and another glass of wine could add to your bill substantially.But I think Waku Ghin could afford to be less rigid, and offer cheaper options for the set menu. In many fine dining restaurants, some premium ingredients are offered as optional supplements. After all, not everyone is crazy for caviar (or truffles, for that matter). Many years ago I went to Tetsuya's in Sydney and while it was a different cuisine (more Franco-Japanese than pure Japanese), it was much more affordable, with the same high level of technique in the dishes and a top service

We started with mojitos carefully prepared and offering a very refreshing start to dinner. For starters we had the Aburi Tasmanian petuna ocean trout with a hint of chili and the Lobster sandwich. They were good and refreshing though calling it the Lobster sandwich a sandwich was a total misunderstanding of the word sandwich. It was just lobster meat in a bisque with two pieces of toasted bread on the side.Next came the Spaghetti with lobster and Spaghetti with king crab. They were both good but unexciting, with no highlights to stimulate our taste buds. They could use a better quality of pasta. The third movement came with Grilled wagyu beef on rice, a very tasty and favoursome offering and the Marinated tuna (Tonbo) set on seasoned rice. Compared with the Grill beef rice, this was really a let down. The seasoned rice is dominated by the vinegar used in the seasoning. The rice was too mushy for our taste. For drinks, we had Negroni, Waku Ghin martini and a Waku Ghin citrus. All tasty and exciting drinks to go with the food. However what stand out is the baby peach cured in truffle oil. An excellent accompaniment to the martini. Each bite explodes with favours. However, there was one on the mushy side, indicating a spoilt baby.They were many service staff but no one opened the doors for us. But finally made up for in the send off.Summary out of 10 points:Food 6, Bar List 8, Ambience 7, Food Value 5, Cocktail Value

A friend who has been to this venue many times suggested us to try it. It is a somewhat fusion Japanese venue, or they are serving a mix of Japanese foods plus some western dishes.I think they only serve a fixed menu of the day during dinner hours. We had many present surprises with the foods that they served, starting from the very first course. For the entire dinner, there were only 2 or 3 courses that were less impressive; nevertheless, still tasted ok. One of the most unexpected surprises was the noodle in a cold soup with lime juice taste; it was such a refreshing dish after the heavy meal (before the deserts).The only drawback that I could think of was its price tag, approx. S$700+ per head. Nevertheless, you are getting back what you paid through the services that they provided and the foods that they served. Should give it a try when you are in town, and of course when you can afford to indulge yourself with a fancy dinner

Had our anniversary dinner at Waku Ghin. We were greeted to a room with 4 sittings. The chef cook & serve in front of us. Foods were luxury & tasty, like works of art ! Very enjoyable ! I must say it is not the type of restaurant that you go often as the set menu is about $500 per head. But it is definitely worth a try if you love high quality Japanese food.

Waku Ghin definitely is one of the top Japanese resto in Singapore. Located on the 3rd floor of MBS casino. The seafood cooking is fantastic. The dessert also super felicious. Chef Tetsuya is rank 9th at this time of writing in Asia so definitely a must try
1
Since the past 5 years it's the 3rd time I have been invited to Waku Ghin.My first visite was definitely a 5 stars rating, the 2nd 3 and the 3rd deserved this terrible point.The first visit with this OMAKASE menu, (meaning for me that it's a daily preparation and chef Tetsuya will have a lot of creation and will follow the season), was good even if the portion were RIDICULOUSLY small and didn't deserved the SGD 400++, but what to do with this aspect of the Japanese cuisine...For my 2nd visit the menu was exactly the same, did chef Tetsuya built his reputation with 1 menu, with only 8courses?The answer on my last trip.... YES!!! SERIOUSLY.....Almost the same menu with the same display... But now the worst is the confidence and the arrogance of your teppan "chef" that assumed they don't have to do the job as the reputation is established in the 50best.SGD400++ and had a Macdo or food court because you are still hungry is absolutely a joke and a tourist trap for MBS

I've been to Tetsuya's in Sydney and I loved it so I was very excited to go to the one in Singapore. The restaurant is located in the new trendy hotel, Marina Bay Sands. It was around 5 minutes walk from the hotel and it was closer to Casino and the shops and the restaurant was on the second floor. Welcomed warmly by the staff, we sat in the very private room in front of the teppanyaki grill. We ordered a glass of champagne to celebrate the night ($50 per glass, the drinks are very expensive) and the chef brought out all the ingredients that they were going to use. The menu was not on the website and they don't give it to you till the end of the night (this part was the same as the Tetsuya's in Sydney). The menu included carpaccio of flounder with bitter salad, marinated botan shrimp with sea urchin and caviar (signature dish), slow cooked New Zealand John Dory with charcoal grilled eggplant, puree of potato with soft poached egg (onset eggs) truffle and caviar, warm salad of abalone with asparagus and Chinese olive, braised Canadian lobster with tarragon, Japanese wagyu (Shiga, and it was A5 rank) with fresh wasabi and ponzu, and then a rice or a noodle dish to finish then gyokuryo (highest quality green tea) and two desserts. Overall, amazing food and service, I enjoyed a nice interaction with the chef. When you pay $450 per person, it's a bit hard to get something wrong. Everything was perfect. The sommelier was knowledgeable, we had a lovely cocktail made by a very polite bar person and our floor staff was very attentive. The hard thing for these restaurant is that people have different expectations so if one small thing goes wrong or it's not what they were expecting, people do get very disappointed. The food was cooked to perfection and I couldn't fault the service. Tetsuya is a world known chef and I loved his food. A lot more seafood compared to Sydney and I would have to say that the food was more Japanese then the one in Sydney. I had a glass of sake after the champagne instead of wine but I would recommend wine with the meal as well. They have a great extensive list of sake and wine and the sommelier is there to give you any advise. It's a once in a life time experience, but if you go, don't expect anything and just enjoy the night. Ask questions to the chef, they are more than happy to explain anything if you are interested. It's an amazing experience no questions asked about that

The price made me worry, it's the most I have spent on a meal and our bill was around $1400 for my wife and I, but we had said yes to everything and his included cocktails, beers, sparkling water and sake. We said yes to all options! The service, food and ambience is 2nd to none and had the most lovely feeling about it. It's quiet, no music and we were whispering, it all added to the feel and experience. The food is stunning and has so much quality, each of the 10 courses and 3 deserts, were world class and were presented in a way that even foodies like my wife were forced to take pics of each meal. All the photos shown are a true reflection of the amazing attention to detail they show on every step of your experience. It was like a performance, as you watch them prepare most of the courses right in front of you and we were sorted with just 2 other couples, but still felt very private as they speak to each group separately and we never feel like a group or anything. It was the one booking we made well in advance of course and planned and we do not regret it. We took to the 2nd sitting at 8:30pm so I suggest to watch the laser show first, then hot the casino for a look and then to dinner. It's all a few mins walk from each over.This place deserves its popularity and demand and we are impressed and delighted to encourage people to make this a special occasion experience. We will never forget his meal and their attention to detail.

Please do read all the reviews in the "poor category", they are spot on. We are a relatively young couple (early 30s) who go to these types of restaurants a couple of times a year. We can afford to go (not every week!) but we also expect a lot as they are a treat for us. If you meet this criteria then hopefully our review is helpful - please don't go here, it's a huge waste.Waku Ghin has to be the biggest disappointment we've ever experienced, and the most expensive (we spent twice what we spent at the fat duck, and it was a significantly less amazing experience).Do they do anything wrong? Not really but it's that they don't really do anything amazing and with this price tag, you really have to (for two people, it cost approx GBP 800 or around USD 1,500 - we had matched wines, also there was about $150 in tax and another $150 in service, added to the quoted prices). So here's what really didn't work for us:FOODThe menu is omakase, so the chef chooses the food. At no point were we given a menu of what was to come or emailed after, which was disappointing (even though the waiter said we would be). The chefs often announced the meals before they were served but their English was not great so often we had no idea - appreciate the benefits of having Japanese chefs but at these prices - and not being in Japan - we would expect there to be some way to convey what we were eating and some information about it. At points there were young female helpers who came over -not quite sure of their role other than occasionally to clarify what the chefs had said, but this certainly didn't happen for every course.The food itself was fine - our favourites were the oysters, sea urchin and abalone. The rest was fine but nothing special. To top it off my husband felt pretty unwell at the end of it.WINEIt seemed odd to be asked about wine straight away when we had no idea about what food we were being served (see above). We felt forced to do matched wines as they weren't forthcoming with information to allow us to pick a bottle and weren't particularly helpful (there didn't appear to be a sommelier to talk us through the options). Either way the bottles of wine were so expensive it actually seemed sensible to do the wine pairing at $250 per head - that gives you an idea about the cost of the wine list. Although three of the wines in the wine pairing were sake, so if you aren't a fan of sake then it's a bit of a waste. The other pairings were pretty good.SERVICEBoth the waiters and chefs seemed robotic and not actually interested in engaging with us, other than to serve the food and say what they needed to. You are seated in small rooms with a chef preparing the meals - we tried to engage but didn't really get anywhere and it was quite uninspiring (compared with Burnt Ends we had been to the day before which was great to watch).ATMOSPHEREUrgh. So dull. We were seated in a room with four other people. There is no ambience. I would say this vibe might work for older businessmen and that's about it. Certainly not for couples - not good for a special occasion. Just lacks any ambience.All in all, we would recommend avoiding Waku Ghin. Save yourself the money - this just isn't up there with the top restaurants.

We began with a chilled soup of Japanese sweet corn with Australian winter truffles and saffron ice cream. The flavour of the corn came through nicely in the soup, not being too sweet, and the saffron ice cream avoided the strongly metallic taste that saffron often brings; the truffles were not overly aromatic, but they added a pleasant additional and subtle fragrance to the soup (17/20). Next was a dish I recall from earlier visits to Tetsuya, marinated botan edi (a large Japanese shrimp) with sea urchin and osetra caviar, presented in a hollowed out sea urchin shell. This was an attractively presented dish that had excellent quality sea urchin and good prawns, the saltiness of the caviar balancing the richness of the sea urchin, and the prawns giving a different textural element to the dish (18/20).The teppan grill came into play for the first time with the next course, with pan-fried fillet of ayu (sweet fish) on a bed of daikon and fennel. This was a very simple dish, and although pleasant and in season, the quality of the ayu was not in the same league as several I have eaten in Japan, where considerable effort goes into ultra-seasonal sourcing (in some cases the fish is sourced from different places according to two week mini-seasons, ensuring the absolute peak of quality). Still, this was a perfectly enjoyable dish 16/20).Next was Alaskan king crab, steamed under a copper pan on the grill in front of us on a bed of sea salt, served very simply with lemon scented extra virgin olive oil from Italy. This was a dish with nowhere to hide, and the cooking technique was faultless, the crab cooked exactly right, the lemon adding just a hint of acidity to balance the crab (19/20). Next was abalone from Tasmania, grilled and served on a bed of fregola and tomato. Although the abalone was good, again I found it less so that some of the remarkable abalone I have eaten in Japan (such as at Ryugin in Tokyo), though the Mediterranean accompaniments worked well enough (16/20). Canadian lobster was next, simply braised with a tarragon stock with a little paprika cream and a shellfish sauce using lobster shells and reduced for several hours. The lobster was lightly cooked, avoiding the chewiness that so often happens with this ingredient, and the light scented stock was a harmonious accompaniment to the shellfish (18/20).There was now an interesting contrast of two beef dishes. First was a tenderloin of Tasmanian grass-fed steak with mustard made from wasabi grown in Tasmania. This was also served with freshly grated wasabi from Japan. The beef was of excellent quality, lightly cooked, but the revelation to me was the wasabi. In the west we are used to being served "wasabi" that is in fact horseradish with green food colouring, which gives a simple one-dimensional heat. I have had real wasabi many times in Japan, and this delivers a much more complex flavour, an initial burst of spicy heat followed by a less spicy flavour, with almost a creaminess of texture. Wasabi comes in many different grades of quality, and the one tonight was of the highest standard, displaying a lovely complex set of flavour notes (19/20). I found the wasabi almost more interesting than the excellent beef. Immediately after this was grilled wagyu beef (grade A5) from Omi prefecture in Japan, aged for just over three weeks. This was heavily marbled with fat and had the rich flavour that comes from that degree of marbling. As with much wagyu beef, it ca be so marbled that you almost forget that you are eating beef at all, and this was the case tonight. This was served with more of the lovely grated wasabi and also maitake mushrooms, with a little citrus soy as a garnish; it is more a preference than anything technical, but I actually preferred the grass fed Tasmanian beef tonight (18/20). To finish the savoury courses was a dish of rice on which was placed a little flounder, which was then immersed in consommé. The chicken consommé was superb, clear and with lovely clean aromatic flavour, nicely complementing the fish (easily 18/20). Dessert was served in a separate room next to the wine storage area, with a view out over the water. Granita of Kyoho grapes (a variety from Jaan) was superb, the texture of the granita spot on and the grapes having excellent flavour (19/20). Japanese white peach was seabed on a bed of champagne granita, and although the peach did not quite have the perfection of some I have eaten in Japan it was certainly lovely, ripe and with delicate flavour (18/20). Finally, a little lemon curd cheesecake was excellent, and even better was a rich chocolate mousse made with Valrhona chocolate, with velvety texture (easily 18/20)

I went to the bar at Waku Ghin on a Saturday night at around 9:30pm. There was plenty of space at the bar. I ordered a Manhattan (they used Rittenhouse 100 rye), which was made perfectly. In addition I ate some Wagyu beef, which was spectacular. The service was exceptional

This is my first time at WG and mostly probably last as the self indulgence cost was a bit too exorbitant for my taste bud. My wife had arrange birthday dinner week for me in Singapore to try the various fine dining spots like Les Amis, Iggy's, Odette, and Andre.You have been warned ahead upon reservation about the shared seating counter arrangement with griddle cooking fashion and the high prices for drinks and food.The 'funny or interesting or odd' part of the whole dinner was that it felt like a communal private wedding affair where all the guests in the same private room had to go thru the same ritual. In our case we shared the room with 2 other couples and had to hear the introduction of the seafood platter and truffle special offering 3 times.What most guests can't accept as in other reviews have mentioned, was the loud noise from some stranger sharing the counter with you. In our case, we had a loud matured guy sharing his resume or career to his new girlfriend and with the rest of the other guests. For such a high end (exorbitantly expensive) dining place, I would assume most guests would want some privacy and silence.We have never dine much in Singapore because service and food value has never been on par with other countries. The only reason wife chose to dine all these restaurants for once this week was because our annual France food and wine pilgrimage was cancelled due to the attacks.A reputable Japanese chef and friend once told me you can teach a sushi or teppanyaki chef the cooking skills over many years but you cant teach him the art of communication over the counter, which is a major pre-requisite for this cooking approach and in this aspect, half the battle is either won or lost with the customer.WG is prime for this aspect of dining experience since it's a counter griddle cooking style but only 3 items (lobster and 2 beef) out of the 10 menu is cooked in front of you. Most of the other food items are pre prepared in the kitchen. But throughout the whole dining experience the chef did not attempt to interact with the guests or because the lack of usage of the griddle or lack of presence of the chef since he is cooking in the kitchen instead, which I am trying to figure till today.Bottomlime, what's the objective of a shared counter dining experience when little is being shared except from some annoyance and loud noise from some other guests. I had to attempt to make small talk with the chef in attendance and ask him what sauce is he using, which area of Tasmania (Cape Grim vs Blackmore) is the beef from ? What grade is the Omi beef ?Just to reinforce what the earlier reviewer mentioned about the bread, I share the same sentiment that the mgmt need to quickly get a new pastry chef to relook at their pastry offerings. Or maybe have a meal at Andre and Odette just for the bread basket.Overall, food portions are small but of extremely high quality produce. I give them high marks for the food (except pastry), but low marks on the dining experience that's why the 4 rating instead of a overall 5.WG will get their 1 star but may be awarded 2 stars because of its extensive wine list, DRC is priced between $45k to 55k a bottle. Heard no high rollers have open a bottle yet.Just for name sake and if you do not mind paying $750pp and share a counter seat, pls dine here. If not, I think Andre, Odette, Les Amis (in order of rank) has better value and better fine dining experience

The pinacle of haute japanese cuisine. From the outstanding service to the awesome dish presentation to the taste. Very innovative and passionate .
Very individualised service at the tapanyaki counter.
5
We had cocktails and oysters at the bar. These surely must be the best cocktails in town, the bartender is a proper cocktail bartender. We had the Irish and the Canadian oysters, they were both delicious.
5
Real good stuff with top quality ingredients. Tho it is quite expensive. Personally i would have preferred a more simple serving of the wagyu beef as opposed to different sauces placed on it
5
Based on the reviewers, I decided to try this restaurant. I am interested to visiting this place because, I can taste the pleasures of sea urchins.. and finalyyyy I tasted straight sea urchin ... and it offered a sense of truly exceptional.. WONDERFULL

Located right at the Marina Bay Sands, where patrons usually don't think too much about value, or money . If you go at Wakughin, don't think either about value. Just accept the price - it will be a minimum of 750 Sing a head. You will be getting a great experience there, beautiful sake, beautiful wine, great food and an impeccable service. The odd bit was the bread ..which, despite beeing apparently baked in house, looked and tasted like a baguette made ifor Supermarkets ! Rest was excellent, wish the lobster stock/reduction would have been more flavorful - the concentration was un sufficient - the signature dish was of course , as usual the real winner . Not a three stars in my view. But a good two stars .

Usually i hate malls and restaurants inside, and when you arrive to your private room, you can only be feeling trapped. But the food journey, the dining experience, the variety of dishes, the products and cooking quality is so high.. When you are invited to join the common dessert room with (at last !) a view on the marina, you realize it s exceptionnal. On top of that desserts are excellent, not far from a french starred dessert chef.. Service a bit rigid and overwhelming but the cook was nice and discreet which made it globally very good anyway. It s super expensive, definitely not worth any diner, but it s poshy place, singapore, far above competition, fully booked all the time, so just bring your platinum visa and forget about it and enjoy if you can

This place is expensive! The food was great and very well presented. Some amazing produce cooked to perfection. The restaurant itself is a little impersonal. We were in a 2 and had to share our kitchen with another pair. It was a bit awkward and quiet. Wine by the glass menu was a bit limited, but had some good choices. The special of the night was a couple of dishes using white truffle which was out of this world. Not sure I'd go back, given the price but I'm glad I went
5
A Top 100 World list place we just had to try. The location, above the large casino floor, is interesting but the noise is not a factor once you get inside. Seating is bar-like in front of the cooking table with several other diners, but only 6 people a separate room. The tasting menu is very well done, mostly seafood and well presented. The one glitch was no one offered us a drink before dinner nor a wine list. We had to ask if there was wine or wine pairings, after which they said, "Oh yes". Once that hurdle was overcome, the wine pairings were quite nice. After dinner and before dessert, you are escorted to a more conventional dining area with a window over the bay. While finishing dessert and coffee, you view the laser light show. A great ending to a wonderful dinner.

We booked for our anniversary (6 weeks beforehand) because we had heard about this restaurant. Even though it doesn't quite rank on the World scale, it still is on every Foodie's list to visit. The communal-style dining booths are a bit hard to get used to particularly if you have annoyingly loud strangers as your dining companions (which we did). You sit up at a Teppan plate with your own chef who cooks for you. This is terrific and if you have a friendly chef, it makes for an great dinner conversation (which it was). We supped on a plethora of fresh seafood including sea urchin, Tasmanian abalone (we flew thousands of kms to eat Aussie local!) and scampi and finished with Wagyu. You are then transferred to a quieter dining room to finish your desserts. It was an experience that whilst very expensive, and not quite the romantic anniversary dinner we were hoping for, was definitely worth ticking off the list
5
This restaurant really is an experience. It is also outrageously expensive. The sea urchin was interesting to say the least. You sit in one of 4 small rooms. There were 3 of us in one room when I visited. Some of the food is brought to you already plated, and other meals are prepared in front of you by your personal chef. For desserts you go to another room. All great fu

serving modern japanese cuisine, bringing new twist to the usual ones you used to have. excellent service, extensive wine collection available.
5
Chef Tetsuya cooks the best food with the best ingredients ... Waku Ghin gives nothing but the best food and service ... The Botan Shrimp and Uni, The Ohmi Beef are our faves!
5
This is the most expensive meal I've had in my whole life. Despite that statement, it's one of the best food I've had in my life. Since it's a 10 degustation course; we were estimating the cost of each dish, and more or less it's really worth the amount you're paying for. I enjoyed as well being right in front of the chef as they prepare the dishes in front of you.
5
I love Japanese food. And I particularly like sea urchin. So when I found out about a Japanese restaurant that incorporates sea urchin into its signature dish I had to try it.The restaurant is located in the Marina Bay Sands complex and one of the dele rity chef restaurants. I enjoyed the 10 course omakase menu prepared by chef Suzuki Right in front of me and 4 other guests - particularly the sea urchin signature dish. I was also introduced to a delicious sake from the Masuizumi brewery's platinum collection. I have never tasted such a smooth and well balanced sake before
4
Tetsuya Wakuda as a brilliant chef brings me back memories of my time in Sydney in 2000, so when I saw his restaurant in Singapore (back in 2014) was on the top 50 list, I needed to go! You have to meander above the casino floor to go to the restaurant, but once in you are transformed by the decor. Very stylish, very sleek. You are ushered to a room where there is about 8 chairs in front of a teppanyaki cook top where you chef prepares all sort of delightful dishes. It was very entertaining and inspiring to watch the process. The presentation was spectacular and visually very appealing, but the flavour (especially after our dinner at Andre) it was not great, mind you it was very delicious, but I guess I was expecting transcendence. Would I recommend the place, sure but maybe as a second or third choice of restaurants in Singapore. The food was wonderful, but I guess my expectations was a little too high
3
This was a good meal don't get me wrong. I liked the way you were seated in a group setting (I was on my own) and got you seat at the cooking table. The presentation of the fish was excellent and some of the courses were truly great. But some were really very average. The wine choices were relatively expensive - even by this type of restaurant standards. My bill for one person came to 630 Singapore dollars. That makes this one of the most expensive meals I have had in the last two years. This didn't make the top 5 meals and might not make the top 10 if I go back and look at it. So that's why it gets an average
5
I tried Tetsuya in Sydney many years ago and that was memorable. I heard a lot of great reviews about Waku Ghin, I visited, and was not disappointed. The restaurant was nicely decorated , the food was excellent ( nothing too fancy ) and the services were top class. I liked to bamboo clams and steak most in the tasting menu, but truly , everything else was well executed. Thanks again, chef Tetsuya

I've heard that this type of "ultra fine-dining" is going out of fashion in Singapore. I must say after visiting Waku Ghin I can understand why. We expected the ten course menu to be decadent, but with such rich flavours heavy on protein we found it difficult to enjoy much past the 5th. This was largely due to the pace the courses came out - we barely had time to finish our matched wine before the next glass was being poured. Perhaps we eat more slowly than the other diners, however we believe an experience like this is to be savored. There were some stand-out dishes that we thoroughly enjoyed, such as the sea urchin with prawn and caviar. The heavier dishes such as the lobster were not to our taste. Moving to a more intimate setting for desert was a nice touch. The $1500 bill at the end of the night was expected but was it ten times better than other meals we've had in Singapore? Probably not
5
This is a must on the bucket list.Price is not a consideration, this exceeds any concept of value for money.This is art at its highest formHad the degustation menu with matching beverage. The experience from the moment we entered till we left AAA+
5
Been loving Tets food in Sydney for over 20 years so when we were in Sing, couldn't resist when the opportunity to dine at Tet's venture in Sing. It's only seats 20+ people at a time, most dishes were cooked in front of diners. Some of the produces were flown in from Tasmania, Japan etc… Waku Ghin serves Japanese dishes, unlike Tetsuya's in Sydney (Japanese with a touch of French). Excellent meal… Excellent selection of wine and sake too…Highly recommen
5
The entire experience was awesome, all the dishes were beautiful, using the best ingredients and pretty culinary skills. Quite pricey $400++ exclude drinks for 10 courses, but definitely worth!

One of our first meals in Singapore after moving from Sydney. Amazing experience, amazing food, once in a lifetime! We got a tour of the kitchen after our meal as we were so complimentary! Don't recommend for non seafood lovers.
4
Fantastic experience. Served and pampered at a special counter. Had our own chef. The food was unbelivable, still remember the sea urchin dishes, and multiple creative variations around Japanese Food. One of the very best meals and services we gave had full stop.
3
I went to this restaurant with such high hopes (50 Best in the World, Friends highly recommended, etc etc…), I was summarily disappointed however. The food, yes, was quite tasty, was it worth what we were charged for it, however, no. We are more than willing to dole of money on a special dinner, this just wasn't all that special. It all just felt forced and a bit rushed (my brother characterized it as Benihana's Logical Maximum). We enjoyed the use of the Teppan grill and our chef was friendly. As a whole it just wasn't on par with its peer competitors we have dined at around the globe, especially given the exorbitant price
2
I've been to many top restaurants around Singapore but Waku Ghin was the most disappointed restaurant on my list. This was my first time here and will never ever come back to this over-rated restaurant. I was served with cheap and low quality seafood for $400/pax. A bottle of water is $20sgd. One small boston lobster was served for 4 people... Small abalones werent even from Australia and the beef was cheap. I think with the money I spent, I can fly to Japan to eat something better. Avoid this place if you expect good food for $400/pax.
5
If you are going to splash out once in Singapore then this is the place. Everything from start to finish was superb. The very friendly greeting, intimate dining room with your own chef, theatrical cooking and sublime food with matching wines -all served very discretely and professionally. Yes it is mega expensive but( as stated many times in previous reviews) you know that before you go- just enjoy you only live once
5
If I had to give a quick sentence that describes my dining experience at Waku Ghin, it would be: It is like Benihana Hibachi restaurant but with better food and impeccable service. Yes, I know...comparing Asia's top restaurant to a Benihana is almost profane. The only qualities that they have in common are the sous chef cooking in front of a group of 6 people with a flattop grill, and they both serve "Japanese" food (the quotes pertain to Benihana).Anywho, Waku Ghin was a delightful experience, from beginning to end. The wait staff was extremely attentive. Some people might be annoyed with that; however, with the money that you're paying for this meal, you almost expect the staff to give you a back rub or even spoon feed you your dinner (jokes). There was a moment where I dropped my napkin AND my chopsticks back-to-back (due to the consumption of a half a bottle of vino). Sure enough, the speedy waiters replaced both in a sec! The food? Amazing. One of the best meals that I've ever had. The sea urchin/shrimp/cavier was amazing. Both beef dishes (Tasmanian/Wagyu) were the simplest, most delicious meat dishes that I've had. The desserts? Yummy. The pastry chef made a special wild strawberry and lavender honey cream crumble for us. I made it clear to the waiter that I don't eat berries, except for strawberries. This was just in case they were going to serve a "berry" dessert. So, they brought out this special strawberry dessert for us. :) Everybody else got a luscious-looking chocolate dessert, which would have been excellent to try. Oh well! Overall, this dining experience was, truly, a unique one. And, yes, most reviewers griped how expensive it is. Yes, it is a pricey restaurant. Would I preferred to pay less for this meal? Of course!! However, the bottom line is that this is a top restaurant, ran by a very popular Japanese chef, located in a very expensive hotel/casino. I believe you get what you pay for. This kind of Japanese food is meant to be simplistic, adventurous, and opulent. My advice is to keep an open mind and enjoy the food. Smell every dish. Savor every bite. This ain't your local neighborhood's Benihana's! This is elegant food at its best
4
Fabulous restaurant very exspensive but great for a very special treat The staff are so friendly and helpful especially the sommelier who didn't overwhelm us with the prices of wine and selected a good Wine at a reasonable price The food is amazing and prepared freshly in front of you I would defiantly recommend this restauran
3
$400 each degustation dinner plus 10% service + 7% tax; now add $20 for a bottle of water ++ and $22 for a cocktail ++... so, dinner for two including two bottles of water and one cocktail $1100!!! Which we would have paid without pain if we would have had an amazing unforgettable meal as we expected but sadly this was not the case. Out of the 10 courses we only enjoyed the Shrimp with Sea Urchin topped with Caviar and the two slices of Kobe. We are aware that a degustation menu means small portions but honestly these people take this too seriously, our Charcoal Grilled Fillet of Tasmanian Grass-fed Beef with Tetsuya's Wasabi Mustard was ridiculously tiny!! I could even count the rocket leaves put in the plate as garnish. I won't make this review too long but the last savory dish Consommé with Rice and Snapper deserve a mention. I hardly found the fish and the consommé was so light and clear that with all due respect I have had better consommés at the hospital, sorry for the honesty. Same to say about the dessert. Melon? and a chocolate mousse? That was pretty ordinary for such an extravagant price! So disappointed after such a wonderful experience at Tetsuya in Sydney.
2
we are really sorry for Mr Tetsuya but this restaurant is nothing compared with the one in Sydney. It was good seeing him at the restaurant welcoming the guests.It all started very well with the display of fresh sea food to be served followed by the sea urchin signature dish but that was it. The portion size were very small to the ridiculous size of the Tasmanian cape grind steak to close with a bland consommé containing white rice and poached fish. We really expected more for S$1100 for two people
5
This is a MUST in Singapore. The food is spectacular and interestingly composed. Service and presentation was exceptional. View from the post dining room great too which allows you to chill and talk. Problem is getting a reservation.
5
I'm rating this restaurant 5 stars based on solely the food and service.
The food was incredible. To be honest I could hardly pronounce any of the ingredients, but the waitstaff who hand delivered our plates to us described exactly what they used.
3
We REALLY wanted to love this Japanese restaurant. I mean it's rated 1 of the top restaurants in Asia! The service was lovely and attentive but for the price, there are so many other fantastic restaurant choices in Singapore that are more reasonably priced and the food is better. We ordered the 10 course menu with wine pairing. The "signature" dish was a marinated shrimp with sea urchin and caviar - and while it looked beautiful, I didn't like it. I think it was one of those dishes that you either love or hate. For such as spendy place, I wanted to eat food that really wow'ed me. The closest I got to "wow" was the wagyu roll with fresh wasabi (delicious) and the abalone with pasta. One of our waiters kept telling us this was a French restauratn - there is just no way! It is totally Japanese and I'm sorry to say that the food is over-rated
5
This is an absolute MUST! If you like Japanese cuisine (and even if you don't), you just have to go there. Each course is amazingly designed, both visually and in terms of taste, can be accompanied with wine or sake (huge selection available for both) and will have you taste Japanese food in a new way
5
This was one of the best dinner I have ever had!In the beginning it was difficult to find the place. You need to take an elevator, which is somewhat hidden to level 4 the atrium. Make sure you know where it is.Once you are there it is a special, sophisticated atmosphere. The service is high class Asian style, which from my point of view is much better than western type. It makes the guest feel very special and is never annoying.Going into the separe you are seated at a big counter in front of the teppan grill, where we were in total four people. Even it is a counter, there is much space and privacy. We were seated with two other people, but we still felt comfortable.And now the food, the reason why you should go to this place, it was outrageous, just unique! A 10 course menu, mainly seafood, just one Kobe beef dish, but definitely great. It's a mix of Japanese and high European cuisine. The dishes build up well. The highlight, which are many, were the signatory dish, raw botan shrimp, sea urchin and oscietra caviar. New Zealand scampi with gnocchi, so pure and delicious. Tasmanian abalone with a type of risotto. My favourite, slowly braised Canadian lobster. It was so tender and the sauce to deep in complexity, this was one of the best dishes I ever had, and the best lobster I have ever eaten. The taste of slowly cooked made it so special, besides the quality obviously. Incredible! The Kobe beef was served with fresh wasabi from the root, very special, I never had this before.And the desert were very good as well, it is served in another area with nice views on the marinha bay. For drinks, as usual in Singapore, alcohol is expensive. Instead of having four glasses of wine for a hundred dollar, you should take a full bottle for the same price. There is a good choice, we took a new zeeland white wine, there was only one. I like the mineral taste of this type and it was good.This was a definitively expensive experience, but worthwhile the full experience. If you can afford it, and you like high quality seafood you will be overwhelmed in this place. Go there! Next time I am in Singapore I will make sure to return. A unique experience, with world class seafood!
5
Since I step in the restaurant till the goodbye I had one of my best food and hospitality experience. Beside a great meal execute to perfection and great attention to details the balance of the dish was great. A linear crescendo that I really appreciate. Service was discrete but present at the right moment. Polite and with a smile that make thinks always better. Definitely in my best 3 restaurant since today. Thanks for the great experience.
2
Second time round - why didn't I learn from my first experience? - both times were equally disappointing. Its about 500/pax if you dont have a lot of drinks. The food was nothing special - the gimmick is that they cook some dishes in front of like a teppanyaki - but it does mean if you are a couple, the timing of your dishes matches the other couple in the room. Their special is the uni, botan and cavier dish -but standard has dropped from last time because my first time round it was the only earth-shattering dish but this time it was less creamy, didn't blend as well and therefore forgettable. All the dishes were forgettable except for the wagyu beef which was the only good dish in the entire 10 menu. Completely disappointin
4
Online booking is a breeze and the email responses are rapid and thorough. The restaurant takes seatings for dinner only at 6.30pm and 8.30pm. Menu is a 10-item degustation where dietary restrictions are entertained. There is a bar outside and drinks can be brought into the restaurant proper. There are 2 private rooms/cooking stations where 7-8 guests sit at a table in front of a chef. The fresh seafood ingredients are presented to diners for their admiration before dinner starts. Diners are offered still, sparkling or mineral water with free flow over the evening for a fixed price per person. We had the famed botan shrimp with uni and caviar, abalone, scampi and lobster. A thin piece of ohmi beef was also on the menu. The Japanese chef was polite but not completely comprehensible. We enjoyed his cooking techniqes. At one point we were politely advised by a member of the wait staff not to take videos of the cooking, but that still photos were fine. After the savoury dishes diners then are invited to a lounge for desserts, where desserts, petit fours and coffee/tea are served to round off the meal. I found the food tasty and well-presented, although I think it is hard to go wrong with the premium ingredients used. I did not find the dishes exceptional in creativity - no real 'wow' factor. All in all, was happy I came, but do not think it's worth coming again in view of the price! One can get excellent Japanese (and other food) for a fraction of the cost with equivalent satisfaction
5
Abit pricy $400++ pp but if you love seafood then this place is to be ... Nothing fancy besides the ingredients ... simple food cooked well. Pretty food and great skills no wow factor but nothing wrong with the food :) just no wow factor.Highlight dishesTetsuya chocolate cak
4
it is extremely close to a full marks minus some of its logistic timing arrangement (fixed 8pm or 530pm dinner timing w totally no lunch timing) and limited window view , as well as some limited choices of wine/sake (some options only have a whole bottle rather than in per glass charging)Its standard is well-maintained from service to pleasant-looking & attentive staff (well diverse of races). Not to mention its standards in Culinary: primarily focused on most japanese-imported stuff with fusion. Freshness, Fine dining...They could be even more daring in their attempt, i felt safe but i would love to see some risks...All of us love the tenderness of its bread (little things score!) , and then its caviar, boston lobster, sea urchin, the honeydew is fibrous w natural sweetness...(two types of beef : Ohmi beef and sorry i forgot the other one)The abalone from aust didnt really fare on the highest range of scores...We can ask for another round of bread or cold dish too, however it is just too filling, though the meal is served only in degustation form(Side point: Luv their signage of their lavatories )Do NOT step in if you do not have S$500 per pax....is that why the server is shocked that i m a Singaporean (yet not a paid food critic)
4
Took my wife for a treat - amazing food - equally amazing bill. From a culinary point of view really enjoyable but just so hard to justify the crazy bill.
5
Yep, this is the one. The food was exceptional. The service impeccable. The chef friendly, knowledgable and very skilful. Don't eat all day so you can saviour the food. Testuya has well and truly excelled himself in this Japanese inspired restaurant.
3
Was the experience relatively enjoyable? Yes. Was it worth $800 per person?No. Adjectives that come to mind. Pretentious & deceitful. Pretentious I was expecting. Deceitful not so much. On arrival we were offered Dom champagne in a gestural manner that implied it was on the house! The bottle was already open! It then appeared on the bill as a $550.000 open alcohol item! You would be right to think that our asking would be a sensible thing to do - but the feeling is 'if you have to ask, you shouldn't be there'. Any way, my advice: If your being shouted - go.If you feel the need to be showy - go If spending $1600 per couple on dinner is chum change - goYou are a major foodie - go If you do not fit into the above - don't go
5
What more can you ask for in a restaurant when the chefs, service and food made me look like the perfect husband I am. My wife could not stop raving about our experience at Waku Ghin and the price tag was not an issue after our luck at the pontoon table. Perfect end to our weekend at sands
5
This was a great experience with a good concept.For the savoury dishes, you are seated in a communal room that seats 4 with a chef who prepares some of the dishes in front of you on the grill. The chef was very personable and explained the dishes thoroughly and the staff provided great service.For the dessert courses, you are moved into the main restaurant area which over looks Marina Bay. The cost is $400 (not including 7% gst and 10% service charge), however is well worth it as it is a unique experience
5
Being a harsh critic and being to so many fine dining restaurants in the world this tops the list.Starting with the service, the chefs, the food and the atmosphere.Yes it's expensive but 100% you will not experience this again unless you come here.10/10 and if we come back to Singapore we would be sure on making a reservation.
5
The concept is nice, the chef is cooking in front of you, you get the see the products before they are cooked, everything is perfect even if the seating is not very sociable as guests are aligned in front of the cooking table so difficult to interact with the other person but the one next to you. The food was absolutely amazing and so was the wine. At the end of the meal you are taking to a salon to have your dessert and coffee. The cake was really good ( not often the case in Asia !!!) and the staff is really helpful and friendly. It does come with an hefty bill to match though so be prepared to spend some serious cash to have this amazing experience
5
Was there to celebrate wife's birthday with her favourite niece, nephew and spouses. Interesting that the chopsticks were visibly damp - reason is to prevent food from sticking and apparently it's also a Japanese welcome. Food, ambience and service are as described by the other reviews.. price too. We thoroughly enjoyed the recommended sake and champagne! Thoughtful of them to provide a dainty birthday cake but even more thoughtful was an additional Anniversary dessert - they probably took the cue from our noisy Yam Sengs... much appreciated
5
This was one of my best meals ever! I had been to Tetsuya's restaurant in Sydney and was blown away by that experience, so I thought I would treat my girlfriend to a dinner at Waku Ghin. The meal was an amazing experience. The service was exceptional and the professionalism of the staff was impressive. We were lucky to get a great table where the Sous Chef himself cooked for us! Wow! No menu, beautiful seafood that is presented to you prior to your dinner, and course after course of wonderfully cooked and unadulterated food! The attention to detail is amazing! From the choice of tableware, ingredients, to even serving Gyokuro tea! My hat goes off! The sake sommelier was an extremely nice touch also! Would definitely return on my next trip to Singapore. The highlight of the meal for me was definitely the urchins
5
Well worth the accolade of 7th best resturant in Asia (San Pellegrino) the preparation, ingredients and quality of cooking is top notch. A very different experience to Tetsuyas in Sydney, but that's what's great about it, it's not a Nobu style cut and paste job. Very well thought out. High attention to detail. Don't miss a cocktail at the bar before your meal
4
Even though it was quite pricey, we had a great time as the chef was very friendly and the ingredients were extremely fresh and unique. The highlight was the sea urchin with caviar! Heavenly! Would definitely come back again!
4
Loved the concept - personal chef etc - and their were some standout dishes (Sea urchin, Caviar). As a total dining experience though, just fell short of being "wow". Great, but not in our top 10.
5
After probably over 10 diners at Waku Ghin the last 3 years, it is each time the best gastronomic experience in the world...again and again and again...
3
With so many other places to have good japanese food in singapore (which aren't cheap either), this restaurant is really expensive!! Perhaps it's the fact that its in Mbs. But it's not bad, it's more for the atmosphere than the food I would say
5
Waku Ghin was one of the best meals I've had in my life - completely memorable.Having dined at many michelin/san pellegrino top 50 restaurants/hatted, usually most meals blur together making it hard to remember.Per Se is probably my favourite restaurant and one that i remember clearly and Waku Ghin is probably up there also.The food was amazing, the showmanship and experience made it a wonderful night out
5
Having had the opportunity to visit Tetsuya's Tetsuya's in Sydney twice I did not want to miss the chance to visit this Singapore location. I was not disappointed. Food was innovatively prepared, well tasting- and served. Service was attentive and well executed. Seating might not suit everybody. Nothing to complain about
4
The entire experience is fantastic. The doors are opened as you walk in, the preparation of the first drink in proper Japanese perfection, the courteous nature of the staff, the chefs. And then the food - impeccable, sublime, heavenly. Expensive - but worth every cent for a special occasion
5
The concept of the restaurant is that you sort of have your own personal chef who caters to your culinary needs. Unfortunately if you are only two you will be seated with strangers, so if privacy is an issue you should probably take it up with management beforehand. The young chef was knowledgeable and combined service with excellent cooking. The menu is varied. The chef explained the concept is French cuisine with a Japanese twist, but for my western taste it seemed more Japanese to me. I loved their sea urchin creation and could eat easily ten of them. You can enjoy a laser show during dessert if you get the timing right, the laser show was at 21:00
5
Nice arrival at the foyer from Marina Sands Mall where you can see the interior of the Casino.Great reception from the staff. Placed in a private dinning room at the chef's table!Amazing Japanese fusion kitchen where we were offered a 12 course dinner based in the best quality ingredients presented upon arrival!Perfect combination of flavors, and portions! Impeccable presentation!Pricy but worth every penny!!!Highly recommended
5
I was here for a birthday treat given by my husband. A few dishes stood out in particular. 1. Fresh oyster given an Asian dressing (Alas, I have forgotten the names of the dishes) I would have never thought to pair oyster with vinegar. That was brilliant.2. Smoked eggplant. I would never have thought eggplant could taste like this. The smokiness that came along with the eggplant was sublime.3. Omi beef. Need I say more?4. Scampi. It was juicy, fleshy, tasty... I don't know if I could use any more adjectives for this.The gyokuro served at the end of the meal was a lovely touch.The only dish that we were a little disappointed with was the uni with caviar. Perhaps, the earlier dishes have built the expectations too high for this signature dish. Or perhaps, we were too used to the uni served at the sushi-yas. It did not suit my palate.Otherwise, it was a fantastic meal with impeccable service at Waku Ghin. This restaurant is easily one of the best in Singapore
3
The place has very nice ambiance. Foods are just average but very pricey. The service ws very good. Tried it once, guess that's enough for me.
5
It's very delicious, very simple, and only omakase. Reservation is tough though.. Very difficult but it's worth every penny. The appetizer is good, the Sea urchin appetizer is excellent, one of the signature dish. Everything is awesome.
2
The style of dining here is interesting. The courses are comprised of excellent quality ingredients, and some are reasonably enjoyable. The sommelier is terrible, and showed no indication of having any knowledge of wine whatsoever - best to make your own choices. Deserts well below average. Overall, very disappointing even without regard to the cost of dining here. There are much better options in Singapore (including, as the last reviewer suggested, The Tippling Club, and Tetsuya's in Sydney is streets ahead
4
Our favourite meal in Singapore. Ever. Yes, it's expensive, but you get over it and realise you just had an out-of-body experience of raw (and perhaps blow-torched) fish. We were awed by the chef's before we even tasted the food. Then we ordered and ate. Then we told the chef to serve us whatever. It was awesome experience
1
We had high expectations of this restaurant on the basis of glowing reviews and previous positive meals at Tetsuya's in Sydney but sadly these were ill founded. The meal was good for the most part but not great but certainly not worth $400 per head. The 10 course menu is very meagre and small items which would usually be considered amuse bouche or palate cleansers are included as full courses. 2 or 3 of the dishes were memorable but not knock-out, including the kobe beef though this could also have been down to the fact that the portion size was so small - only half a small steak each. Dessert was small (notice a theme here!) and slightly boring. The options for those with dietary restrictions are also unspectacular and lacking in variety. My husband's first two substitute dishes looked identical. In addition, they were not prepared on the teppan and appeared from a hidden kitchen leaving diners with restrictions feeling less carefully catered for and therefore distinctly unloved. The sommelier had no idea about the wine selection and suggested entirely inappropriate but expensive wines despite a very careful description of what we wanted. Overall, a very disappointing experience. We had been fortunate enough to have a superb meal at The Tippling Club in Tanjong Pagar a few days beforehand which was truly spectacular and less than 2/3 of the price of Waku Ghin. If you want something really special, head to The Tippling Club instead and ask for a seat at the counter where you'll see some really interesting cooking in their open plan kitchen

Perched above the Marina Bay Sands casino gaming tables is this small twent five seater restaurant Waku Ghin from chef Tetsuya Wakuda. Every diner will end up with there personal chef. If the sea urchin starter with prawn and caviar is on the menu then you are in for a treat, the canadian lobster was mouth watering, so was the abalone from Tasmania, the wagu beef was sublime. Waku Ghin is restauarnt that Tets always wanted where he can source the best produce from every corner of the world. Start with a martini, the beverage list is well curated, with a fine sake selection. This is a world class restaurant

Highly anticipated, our visit was a little disappointing. From the hidden entrance into an almost dark room (sigh) which is way too self conscious and makes you feel like unworthy when you for stumble blindly into the nearest chair in front of a load of snobbish casino goers to the mini-restaurant rooms with 5 bar stools (err uncomfortable, I'm spending a fortune I want a chair back and not to get varicose veins) it was all a bit much. Yes some of the food was very delicious (the beef, some other stuff) but the famous sea urchin, well I literally had to gag it down. The wine pairings were good. We paid about $1800. It's too much for what it just faffed around food. Unless you are a food blogger I'd say don't bothe

This is my second time at a Tetsuya joint and I can honestly say that it just keeps getting better. My first experience was at Tetsuya's Sydney for my birthday and everything was just amazing! So when I heard/read that Waku Ghin was rated even higher I knew we had to celebrate my dad's 60th birthday there. Booking was done via email and the team at Waku Ghin made it very easy. There are 2 seatings every night, 5.30pm and 8.00pm. We opted for the latter and the session usually runs for a minimum of 3 hours. 10 courses in total which includes the petit fours and a dessert. There were 5 of us in attendance and it worked out to be around $672 per person including GST and drinks. We were originally planning on wine pairing but that entails 5 glasses (1 litre) per person and that was simply too much for mum and grandaunt.They don't encourage sharing as there would be an additional fee to do so. Instead, we chose 4 glasses per the sommelier's recommendation: Champagne, chilled Sake, White and Red. My dad and I highly recommend this experience as we believe it heightens the once of a kind dining experience. I have to admit I had my reservations about some of the dishes. Just by browsing a couple of reviews I could tell that the sea urchin and abalone are star/staple dishes. I'm not a big fan of either (Sea Urchin in Tsukiji Market and Abalone at various Chinese New Year functions) and I was really worried I would not fully enjoy myself!At the start of the session, each dining party is assigned a personal chef and in turn they will showcase the live array of seafood we were to consume that night. Live, because they started wriggling right in from of my eyes. Honestly, the sea urchin was mind blowing! There was no taste of the ocean nor was there any imperfections with the dish. It was silk on our tongues and fragrant on our palate. Without giving away too much, the abalone was scored thinly and cooked to perfection. The marbling on the Wagyu beef was crazy (but that was to be expected at a place like Waku Ghin) and Chef Masa barely seasoned it before lightly searing it on each side. Writing this review was harder than I thought it would be because the experience was amazing but at the same time I didn't want to give away too much. I believe there should be an element of surprise when you see fresh ingredients respected for its purity and prepared just to enhance the flavours. In essence, all 5 of us agree it was certainly an unbelievable experience and very well worth the money we paid. Also, we now view food very differently and it leaves us wanting much more
5
It was a perfect night just what you would expect from Tetsuya. Yes you do need to take a morgage out to dine here but it was worth it! There was no pretentiousness at all, it felt intimate as there was only 7 of us at the table and didn't see the other guests, we had a chef all to ourselves and we had at least two wait staff. The sommelier was wonderful he made the night for us, his choices were divine especially the Pinot wine. He was so accommodation to my daughter (she's 8yo) and even picked matching drinks for her, at the end of the evening he gave us a private tour of the wine room. We also got yo go in the kitchen and have a peek which was awesome. The highlight of the night was of course the food it was so fresh and cooked just right respecting the produce. Everything was melt in your mouth delicious, perfect balance in taste. It really was a gastronomic experience. A must for any foodie. I don't understand how this could be number 50 in the worlds best restaurant list below Attica which I went to the week before (read my review). Unlike Attica the theatre was in the cooking & produce. This is what you would expect from a top restaurant and they definitely delivered. A memorable experience.
5
The food here is beyond anything I've experienced anywhere in the world, and yes, I've eaten a lot of places! It brings a new meaning to 'fresh' with the base flavours of the main components standing tall, but perfectly complimented by subtle, beautiful flavourings. The sea urchin is incredible. The beef tastes like you could cut it with a spoon. I am dreaming still about the chocolate truffles we finished with. The matched wines and sake were excellent, although the wines were very familiar ones for us as Australians. Unlike the previous reviewer who didn't like the 'hibachi' style seating, we were ok with that because it is still intimate and serious service. There is no Benihana style theatrics in preparation or service. When I expressed interest in the grill (which is actually a very clever induction plate not a Benihana style grill) the chef explained how it all worked and, because I was interested, took me out the back and showed me around the kitchen. Service was unobtrusive and perfectly timed. Yes, we moved to the lounge for dessert, but then lingered over some very excellent Pedro Ximinez while admiring the view, which was a lovely way to finish
5
This is a outraged gastronomy dinner... If you can afford it, don't miss it... Every dish is pure enjoyment and I am grateful to be invited to not one..but twice.... Both out doing one another.

Well.... for the 7th best restaurant in the world, it was a disappointment. The service was amazing and at the same time lacking. You sit at a high hibachi table identical to Benihana. Only 3 courses are prepared in front of you, the other 7 or 8 are served from the kitchen. Your seafood is presented to you at the beginning of the meal and some still alive, which is fine.After the presentation it was hard to talk across all 5 us laterally. If were less than 5 then another 2 people would have been seated with us and would have had to join the family conversation.After dinner you are moved to the back room for desert, which is actually to open the table for the next sitting. For the price paid $400 per person plus 7% Marina Bay Sands service charge plus GST plus 10% tip plus drinks or wine it becomes a truly large bill. The Wagyu Beef and Lobster Braised was excellent, the other courses were ok but not a wow.It just comes across as a Las Vegas style, very expensive hotel restaurant. I would not go back and would recommend other Singapore eateries especially for what they charge and what you get for that price
5
Absolutely the best restaurant that I have ever been to in my life. The freshest ingredients, impeccable service, and friendly staff. The uni with caviar is my favourite. Just melts in your mouth. Over the past year, I have found myself dreaming of the food at Waku Ghin since our first visit, and had to come back again and again for a quick fix. Thank you Waku Ghin, every penny spent here is well worth it
3
I like to taste many bites for different flavor experiences. The chef knows what he's doing undoubtedly. The problem is that when we got out of the restaurant we weren't only hungry but disappointed...we paid 1.600 $, and we didn't think it was amazing...they charged a bit than 11$ for very very small coffee, considering what we were already paying. The staff attention is good, flavor is good, but I honestly don't think that the price is right. I like the fact that we had the opportunity to go, but wouldn't repeat it.
5
.. the Lobster waved before heading to its culinary execution. Proving how fresh the food was. At the start chef shows you the selection of seafood that will be served. As an Omakase meal you get what is served but as in the case of my wife they check for allergies or dislikes. The food was exceptionally prepared - here is the run down of what we had:French Gillardeau Oyster with Ginger and Rice wine Vinegar.anMarinated Botan Shrimp and Sea urchin and Oscietra Caviarslow-cooked NZ John Dory with charcoal grilled aubergineTamanian Abalone with Fregola and Tomato - mmm best Abalone I've had in Singapore and from sustainable sources from TasmaniaCharcoal grilled fillet of Tasmanian grass-fed beef with Tetsuya's Wasabi mustard (beef from Cape Grim)Ohmi Wagyu from Shiga prefecture with Wasabi and Citrus Soy (hand grated wasabi)Somen with Myoga and JunsaiGyokuro (green tea to clear palate)Desserts: musk melon, chocolate Mousse, Petit FoursI also asked for wine pairing which was an extra 250 dollars but complimented the food nicely, includes sake. The stand out dish for me was teh sea urchin - i usually don't like and Abalone - never had a fresh one before.they also kindly made the mousse into a mini birthday cake with hand written chocolate message for my lovely wife's birthday
5
Words almost fail me in describing this meal. Our last meal at Waku Ghin was wonderful - hence our return visit - but in many ways this was even better. This isn't just about the fabulous food, its the whole experience; the theatre of the food being presented and cooked before your eyes, the beautiful presentation, the immaculate service and the venue. Yes it is expensive but we left feeling that it was money well spent.
5
Having tried Tetsuya's in Sydney, I knew that Waku Ghin would be nothing short of amazing, and after dining there last night, I can say that I was truly impressed with the food, service and the whole "chef's table" experience. It was so much better than I expected!Every dish that was placed in front of us, was cooked beautifully and presented like a work of art. Staff were attentive, but not overcrowding and all of them had a lot of knowledge about the ingredients used in the dishes. There is no denying that the price per head is costly! But what you get is a lovely 2-3 hour meal, delicious food and an amazing dining experience that Chef Tetsuya created himself
5
This is an amazing restaurant with one of the best meals we have ever experienced. To start we did not love the location and the restaurant is quiet. We enjoyed our fellow guests but the seating is not for everyone. However, once the food starts to flow every bite is amazing. The quality and freshness is exceptional and everything is prepared for you in person so there is interaction with the chef. The beef was brilliant and the wine pairings perfect. We liked the change to the scenic windows for drinks and desserts and you get a chance to watch the laser light show. This is a culinary tour de force and though expensive we left feeling it was worth and it and very satiated. A must in Singapore
3
Was with a friend to celebrate her 40s birthday at Waku Ghin the food quality is very good, top notch and very fresh, we trully enjoyed every course of it till the end. However the Sommerlier's recommendation of each course of wine pairing is very bad taste! We told him at the start we don't want a lot of the drink but would like to taste the different pairing with each course, at the end the wine were too much and the birthday girl was feeling unwell. My feedback is "food should make you feel good likewise for drink too" you want to enjoy it and not feel sick after a meal. His comment was the drink amount is standardized, if it's it should be McD that is standardized ... for the price we have paid I expect customization. I enjoyed my last year experience with the Sommerlier at Andre he was personalized
4
The product that Tetsyua uses in this restaurant is quite amazing, the dishes are simple, yet they still seem to change on the 3 visits we have had. His Sydney restaurant over the years has become dull and boring, though this is where you can feel a new sense of energy in the dining private communal rooms. Everything was faultless, the abalone and wagyu courses were divine!. Only qualms I could have were the service staff seemed a little lost for such an establishment
5
A beautiful meal prepared in an exceptional way. Everything was so fresh and of the best quality. The deserts were beautiful as we'll. Only problem was the price $1570 Singapore dollars was far too much for a single meal.
5
Awesome food and excellent service. Each course was amazing and spectacular. Much better than Tetsuya at Sydney. The chef himself was very friendly and it was a truly wonderful meal.

Restaurant Waku Ghin , Number 7 on the list of Asia`s best restaurants , Number 50 in the World 2014 and the Singapore base of Japanese chef Tetsuya Wakuda, a bit of a shining star of Japanese cuisine and media. The only reason I went to Singapore was to eat here so i was expecting big things and to be honest the `Meal of a lifetime`.The restaurant is situated within Singapore`s Marina Bay Sands hotel which nowadays is the country`s most identifiable landmark…..think of Singapore and you immediately connect with the triple towers and the swimming pool table top. The cost of this complex was “8 Billion” Singapore dollars. The restaurant itself is a bit of a strange place to get to so allow plenty of time if you`re going. Its on the first floor above the huge casino. I tried to get in via the casino but was politely turned away as i didn`t have my passport. I was sent through the exclusive shopping mall , up a lift and onto a totally deserted floor where i had to scout around before spotting the Waku Ghin restaurant sign.When i arrived i was the only diner in the restaurant. It got a little busier throughout the evening but generally i found the atmoshpere to be a bit awkward. No music…only silence. Waku Ghin ( Spring forth and Arise / Silver ) interior is split into various small rooms, each containing a set of seats and a counter housing an immaculate griddle. The restaurant where i was dining only had 5 counter seats so that was 5 of us dining on the early sitting. The other two couples arrived shortly after i had been seated , both couples arrived and sat in silence.It was bloody awkward to say the least .I chose not to drink wine as the prices were bordering on plain silly so i went for a cold Tiger Beer at $16 (£7.60) and a bottle of mineral water at $20 (£9.50) Justify that if you can.I left the restaurant feeling as though i`d just been kicked squarely in my Gonads . I very rarely whinge about a meal as you`ll see from my many blog posts but on this occasion i felt very differently. My Bill came in at $ 513 dollars ( £244 ) with no wine. The Tasmanian Beef course was omitted from the menu.The Abalone was “portion controlled”. The fine flavoured Wagyu was overpowered by the fresh Wasabi.The signature Cheesecake never appeared and i was served a “slice of Melon”…….We live and learn. I had a relaxing stroll around the stunning Marina Bay , took aboard a few thoughts on my life and then went and spent $2 dollars on an amazing bowl of Chicken noodle soup and a stir fry in Chinatown……finally , the food hit the mark

I don't like its location, walking past the Casino to get to the restaurant didn't do that much for me, casinos aren't my thing. The restaurant is designed so that you get to sit at a counter in one of about half dozen rooms that seats probably up to about 12 people, which is nice and intimate, watching the food being cooked in front of you, I love that. Food was presented to you in its unprepared state and you were told about its origin. Each dish once cooked and served came with a full explanation of the ingredients. The freshness of the food was outstanding. Each dish was presented in such away that your taste buds were screaming out Yum Yum. For dessert you were escorted to a table that overlooked the city which was gorgeous and got to see an amazing light show, very spectacular. I loved every dish that was served to me, flavours were amazing, especially the Ohmi Wagyu, that was just delicious. You are definitely paying for the incredibly fresh ingredients, but the wine was way too expensive, over the top. Would I go back......maybe, maybe not. Service was excellent, but I would expect nothing less for the price. For similar price I personally would always return to the Tippling Club though. That's my favourite
5
This is certainly an expensive dinner, so be prepared... but if you can afford to splurge, then don't hesitate! It is a different experience than what you might expect from most restaurants. You are seated at a bar with each course being prepared in front of you. The food speaks for itself - Marinated Botan Shrimp with Sea Urchin and Oscietra Caviar, Tasmanian Abalone with Aonori, Braised Canadian Lobster with Couscous and Tajine Spice - are a few examples and are all delicious. The Wagyu Beef course was seriously one of the best things I have ever tasted. The staff is friendly and attentive. When it comes time for desert, you are moved to a table in a different room where you are able to enjoy a nice view as you complete your meal. Do it
5
If you are looking for delicious food - waku ghin is the one! I have a feeling it's the type of food that would hardly even be the subject of debate as I enjoyed almost every bite through each of the courses. While the price levels are admittedly too high for me, would not mind eating there again for a very special occasion. Excellent job to whoever is behind Waku Ghin. Keep it up!!

We went along on a Saturday night when staying in Singapore for the weekend.What a wonderful experience. We've been to Tetsuya's years ago and loved it. This is certainly different.You are seated in a small room at a tepanyaki bar and you have dinner with 4 others. We were forewarned about this possibility. We had a lovely couple next to us who were also celebrating a birthday. The couple on the end seemed nice enough but were a little loud and intrusive, but generally were fine.We did the set menu with the wine pairing. Staff were attentive and asked about allegies and dislikes ahead of time. FOODFabulous! It was beautifully prepared and presented. They rely on the freshness and quality of their ingredients to make the dish. And what quality they are.I actually enjoyed Abalone for the first time. We both enjoyed every dish served.WINEThe wine pairing was very good and complimented the foods brilliantly. I'm not a sake drinker so they substituted any sake pairing with a wine.STAFFFriendly, attentive and professional. Sometimes almost too efficient with the taking plates away and putting new things in front of you but it's a minor thing.DECORLiked it. It's dark but not cold. The smaller room idea is a good one. PRICEIt is expensive. It was somewhere we went as a treat. It is not somewhere you plan to go for the sake of it. Saying that though, we thought it was worth it and would do it again

It was for a very special dinner celebration and we have decided to choose a very restaurant to indulge and Waku Gin was our first choice and the right choice ! This is one of those spectacular restaurant that is special from the decor to the food , the service and the presentation of each dish, every aspect was perfection. As it was our first visit, we got the manager to recommend a menu for us and each dish was well recommended as they were sublime and each of these dishes went so well with the next one. The presentation of the dishes was creative, the flavours were beautiful and the ingredients were special, fresh and of top quality. Yes, it was indulgence in every sense and $$$ but it was totally worth it ! We look forward to our next visit here again. Great experience 
5
We went there with my husband 2 days ago and had a great experience. The food is high quality, the service is fautless, and the whole diner was really tasty.Of course this is an expensive restaurant and for a french person like me the air conditionner is way too high ( I will suggest people who are not used to air conditionner to bring a jacket or you'll be freezing). But the overall experience was really great. The beef was so tasty and tender, the abalon was great too and we were not deceived ( as it is often the case after a good meal) by the desserts that were a perfect ending to this great evening.The sommelier is french, and gave us good advice for the choice of the Sake ( they have such a great choice of Sake in this restaurant).We really enjoyed our diner at Waku Ghun and for sure we will come back
5
We have eaten at tetsuyas in Sydney a few times and haven't really thought it was phenomenal, but I can honestly say that Waku Ghin was fantastic. Yes it is expensive and yes there is not that much food, but my oh my it is clever and inventive and tasty. Sitting at a table watching a chef prepare the food was magical as he explained where the produce came from and why different ingredients were used. It's what we thought momofuku would be and wasn't. Brilliant seafood and excellent service. Definitely highly recommended by us! Domo arigato Suzuki san
5
The like 15 course menu was absolutely delicious, in a private room with our own chef. He was enjoying our company because my hubby and I like tasting new things all the time. Everything was exquisite! Very pricey, but so worth it!
5
All of their seafood was so delicious, very fresh. Especially their signature Sea urchin: it looked tough outside with all those spikes, but inside, it was sweet and tender. The service, for sure, was great. The view at night was amazing too.
5
If you happen to be in Singapore, and you happen to gamble, and you happen to win BIG, then go to Waku Ghin! Upon entry you are guided to a small room with bar stools and a teppanyaki grill, seated down and introduced to the chefs (if you're friendly then you'll also meet the three or four other diners in the room). After asking about allergies and dietary requirements, the chef will then display the nights offerings (most of which are likely to jump at you). The most memorable dish for me was the abalone. It was cooked to perfection, and required no sides - this is surprising considering my hatred for abalone!The only disappointment was the Uni (the only other food that i have never enjoyed). Having said that, this was the best that i've had so far - outside of japan, and the combination of flavours with the saltiness of the caviar was excellent. I would definately recommend this restaurant. An added bonus was that our chef was extremely amusing and very charismatic, only adding to the experience
5
I've had the good fortune to dine at Urazawa and Masa and view Waku Ghin as in that elite company. Of course it's excellent and fresh, what elevates a place (for me at least) is the uniqueness of flavor profiles, combinations and presentations. This place has them. You look forward to each new course and are often wowed. I wouldn't pay to do any of these places twice, but I don't regret splurging on this once
4
After reading reviews on TA, we decided to have dinner at Waku Ghin. I was impressed by seafood of this restaurant. Ingredients were fresh and well prepared. Dishes were cooked excellent and beautiful presented. Price was reasonable. Staff was professional. These things made this place have a luxurious and romantic ambiance. I had a great dinner at here. Highly recommend. I will get back if I have a chance to visit Singapore again
5
Anytime you are looking for guaranteed high quality and delicious food - count Waku Ghin among your options. I have a feeling it's the type of food that would hardly even be the subject of debate as I enjoyed almost every bite through each of the courses. While the price levels are admittedly too high for me, would not mind eating there again for a very special occasion. Excellent job to whoever is behind Waku Ghin. Keep it up!!

Tucked at the 2nd floor just above the smoke-filled Marina Bay Sands Casino the discreet door led us to this exquisite fine dining of modern European-Japanese cuisine. As guests of a surprised birthday gift specially planned by a very thoughtful hubby for his wife with some of her good old friends, we savoured the signature marinated Botan Shrimp with Sea Urchin and Caviar, and Wagyu with Wasabi and Citrus Soy, the superb birthday chocolate mousse cake and lobster in the 10-course degustation menu. They are very good with a very deep pocket! Go all the way with a special room overlooking Marina Bay for a spectacular view of the daily 8 and 10 pm laser shows! Memorable indulgence with good friends! Thanks for a lovely evening
5
You will definitely falling love with the food and ambience. Excellent service, perfect foods and wine. Timing of serving food is also great. I have nothing to complain.If you go there for business dinner with your client, you will definitely close the deal.If you go for dating, she will be impressed by you. They will serve you only course menu like 9 courses. Beautiful presentation.What you pay is what you get. Be prepared for the bill
4
I celebrated my special surprise birthday dinner here with my husband back in May 2011. The fusion Japanese fine dining restaurant has a very nice view of Marina Bay at night and a romantic ambience! The food was delicious and unforgettable although it took him at least 3 months in advance to book the table
3
Family of 3 went in February 2013 for dinner. Maybe I came here with too much expectation. I was not impressed, atmosphere was stiff and the service is not that great with exception of the chef who prepared the food in your presence and one or 2 of the waiters. Unlike some other restaurant of the same calibre or price range it lacks the wow factor. Moreover there was not much privacy, people are watching you all the time. Chairs are also not too comfortable. Food was just average. Will only go back if someone else is willing to give me a treat which I think is not quite possible except my hubby
5
We were there to celebrated our 10th anniversary and the chef was very nice in giving us a specially made cake for the occasion. The food, though tiny in portion, was big in gastronomic experience! Love everything they served. Can't wait to go there again.
5
This Restaurent is a must if you like to be adventures with your food. You cannot complain it is expensive cause it is worth every penny that you are charged !! My 13 year old loved the sea urchin signature dish and ordered it twice !! Long live Tatsuya and all his great staff
5
Having enjoyed Tetsuya in Sydney - we were very pleased to find Waku Ghin in Singapore. Although still a restaurant run by the same chef/owner, the overall experience was completely different. While we knew it was going to be expensive, especially with the matched wine course - we were very surprised when the bill arrived. We do not research the prices before picking a place - because we may financially talk ourselves out of a great experience. This was a very good experience, but the 1600USD for dinner for two with wine felt a little more than over the top. Each course was extraordinary, building flavors and textures at each pass. The chef we had was very engaging - but not overly involved in our experience - which i appreciated. We also did not engage in any way with the couple in our room. In hindsight, knowing what we paid - I am happy not to have shared the night with strangers - maybe I am anti-social - but this is truely a once in a very long while type of experience. I am surprised to read that the menu does not change much - our chef indicated that Tetsuya is in residence at least once a month for several days. If I were to repeat the meal and have the same meal - I would be very disappointed. The signature dishes (Botan shrimp with sea urchin and oscietra caviar and the Australia abalone with fregola and tomato) were incredible, as was the shaved kobe beef. Our timing was very good - as we were able to watch the early 9pm(ish) light show at MBS. I was surprised to be charged 10SIN for an expresso at the end - felt like being nickeled after spending 1.6 thousand...... I would not repeat - but would recommend to friends for a very special experience. There are many Michelin-star restaurants that are equal or better for much better value. I will though always return to Tetsuya in SYD - each and every trip
5
The restaurant is very expensive, at the first glance. But when you try the food you understand that it's really worth visiting and trying. Traditional courses but all with some special flavor. Direct contact with chef and observation over the cooking process makes it very intimate. If I visit Singapore, I ll have second try
3
Its a great restaurant however its pretty damn pricey! The uni and caviar dish was amazing but then again how do you go wrong with uni and caviar? I dont think it was worth the money but im glad i went to check it out anyways
4
At $500 (USD$400) for a 10 course degustation menu, the entire experience is expected to be comfortable and unforgettable. The relative high quality with the high price is a given. Therefore I am sorry that I was not that impressed with the dishes compared to other Michelin-star restaurants I have visited around the world. I wish that after repeating the same menu for almost three years there could be some innovations in presentation, some seasonalities of ingredients and some surprises in taste. And perhaps a more permanent chef since it is not realistic to expect the present of Mr Tetsuya. While I still enjoy the signature marinated Botan shrimp with sea urchin and oscietra caviar and the Australia abalone with fregola and tomato, I have also discovered many attractive alternatives that offer equally great good outside the prestigious casino with genuine warm service. However, Waku Ghin is still a place to impress someone, given all the publicities the establishment had received
5
My 2nd time here. The service is top notch. The service staff are ever attentive. The quality of food is at its finest and freshest. Brought my partner for a date and order a bottle of champagne, bill came up to SGD$1224, 10 course meal. Book in advance and u are expected to leave ur credit card details to them via a fax or email. With the understanding if u fail to cancel the reservation 1-2 days advance, $400++ per head will be deducted off ur card
5
Of course I didn't try all restaurants, but I tried many! And I don't give many feedback... This is slightly overpriced, with the wine it is around 700 SGD per person, but the 6 or 8 times I had dinner was an excpetional experience!Their flagship dish is so expetionaly good that I made it my profile picture
5
Be prepared for a gastronomic feast. What a lovely evening we had there. The food was stunning, the staff outstanding and the attention to detail in the ambience of the place made the whole evening memorable. The chef's signature dishes were amazing. I was the only vegetarian person in the group and that certainly did not cause any issues at all and the soup of avocado with potato ice cream and tonburi at the start sent me to heaven straight away! Make sure you book as that is the only way you can guarantee a table
5
We ate at Waku Ghin in early April - my wife, 10yo daughter and I. Enough has been said here about the nature of the food already - it's exquisite, and the local, Tetsuya-trained chef at your table will not disappoint. All courses will be memorable, but for me the grilled Tasmanian abalone was just divine. They were great with our daughter, and she shaved the wasabi for the table with the chef who was warm, attentive and personable in a way that we've rarely seen here. There are staff aplenty quietly swarming behind you to ensure that everything runs smoothly, and the service is of a very high standard. At the end of the meal, you're escorted into the dessert room, an elevated, large glass-windowed space of tables from which you view the light show at the Marina (a little reminiscent of Quay in Sydney). By this stage, I was only able to manage coffee and petit fours, having been wonderfully and cheerfully fed some of the world's best food. Expensive, but I'd happily recommend this as easily the best possible restaurant experience in Singapore
5
I walked to the restaurant through MBS and did not expect to find such a perfect restaurant in the casino. We went as the big group of 9, sake Jumnai Daiginjo was very good beyond our expectation. Great food and warm service.
5
The most amazing gillardeau oysters, they are the creme de la creme of the oyster world... The trout is to die for! And the seafood salad a great sashimi plate. This was just the bar menu you have to go here....!
5
A fabulous experience, one not to be missed. Tetsuya's Singapore restaurant is amazing, the service is perfect, your meal is prepared by your own private chef on a high tech teppanyaki grill, and the food is absolutely amazing. 10 courses which were the perfect size so not overly full at the end of the meal. Sea Urchin, Wagyu Beef, Lobster, and more, just fabulous. After dinner, coffee taken in a lounge area, along with dessert wine and Petit Fours overlooking Marina Bay and the last laser light show of the night. An exceptional evening, with a price tag to match

Eating at Waku Ghin was truly a memorable evening for me and my wife. Firstly, this was a meal to celebrate our marriage just a few days ago. Also Tetsuya is my culinary idol (unfortunately I have not had the opportunity to meet him as he has never been at his restaurants each time I have dined) and we were going to Singapore as a stopover on our honeymoon, so Waku Ghin was a perfect excuse to splurge on a mind blowing meal.The service here is top notch, you get your own private chef, and the food is absolutely amazing (as the restaurant sources only the finest ingredients in the world). Truly one of the best meals I have ever had! For detailed review of Waku Ghin, please see the following link:http://foodmab.blogspot.com.au/2013/04/waku-ghin-singapore-15-june-2011.htm

Hard to understand the some mixed assessments of this extraordinary place. WakuGhin really deserves to be among the highest evaluted gastronomique places in the world. Five minutes in walking distance from the Marina Bay Sands, take the way thru the gallery of the casino (impressive), you enter a world which first reminds you on a simple teppanyaki grill. To a certain extent it has similarities, but what and how the food is prepared and presented is a class on its own. You must choose the menu, which is worth every cent, starting with unforgettable Gillardeau oysters, a Sea urchin, which cannot be better in Sicily, a fillet of Tasmanian Grass-Feed Beef, which for us won against the Wagyu and, and ..... Just order and let surprise yourselves, you won't forget the evening. And talk to the sommelier or to the well experienced service staff. If you like Pinots ask for what is not on the wine list. We had the recommended Ontago Burn Cottage, a dream to this menu, so the second bottle was a must

Like many fine dining places in Singapore, the fitout is top notch, the service is faultless and the quality of food is usually very good. all these qualities were evident when dining at Waku Ghin. the food was delicious and very theatrical watching them prepare it all on the hot plate in front of you. the produce is fresh and the uni dish is amazing. however, there is a big price tag that comes with it. having dined at Tetsuya's in Sydney, i think it is a lot better value for money and i left feeling very full. i was not fully satisfied when leaving Waku Ghin. albeit a very different style menu at Tetsuya's compared to Waku Ghin, i prefer his original restaurant in Sydney

This is a quite unique dining concept. You're showing into small rooms, each with its own teppanyaki-style grill and a chef assigned to you cooks the various dishes from the tasting menu in front of you. There's some exotic and expensive ingredients here but the flavours are surprisingly subtle - too subtle for my liking. Once you're through with the savoury courses, it's into the main room overlooking the CBD for the evening light show across the water and the dessert courses. It's an enjoyable experience but definitely in the special occasion basket because it's quite expensive. The individual rooms, when there's only a few people in attendance feel a little cold and strange but it's nice to be able to chat to the chef

I was fortunate to first eat at Testuya's establishment in Rozelle, Sydney.Along with the local chilli crab, eating here was to be one of the highlights of a five day eating jaunt with a girlfriend for our respective birthdays.She has never eaten Testuya's food, but as a chef is well versed as to his creativity and notoriety ...she was blown away !Fortunately, once inside the calming environs one easily forgets you are on the 2nd floor of a casino.The private dining room was a haven.The staff friendly, efficient.. special mention must go to our 'private chef' Kaz, also formerly of Sydney who was most engaging both about the fare we were about to consume and local tips !{ Thank you, we took your advice and went the next day for lunch ~was worth getting wet in the afternoon thunderstorm}The next few hours was hynagogic.Whether it was the enlarged 'golf ball' in my scotch tumbler, to the simple but superb crockery the evening was sublime.No need to describe the ingredients..sourced world wide.Being asked whether any allergies or dislikes is welcomed..it would be dismal to waste any of the ten courses that one is about to indulge.The combinations presented were visually enticing...and tasted even better.With an excellent wine list and some great martinis the evening was worth the flight from Melbourne.I was fortunate to explore the cellar after dinner..it was akin to a library, with bottles from every conceivable wine producing nation.Dessert with a view, the BEST(must be an Australian barista) coffee in all of Singapore and conversation with fellow guests from Venezuela and Israel, completed a food experience second to none.Is it cheap ? Of course not. If however, one is ‘in’ to food and the experience of dining like this, it is affordable gratification.Enjoy

A birthday meal befitting of a royalty. Before the meal, I was rather skeptical, thinking that Waku Ghin is going to be like all those over-rated celebrities' chef restaurants; form over substance. But Wak Ghin is nothing less than spectacular.We arrived early were seated comfortably in the classy bar area. A sweet fruity white wine was introduced to whet my appetite and I was instantly swooning in delight upon the first sip. It was thus natural to get a whole bottle, which was extremely satisfying and lasted us through the 10 course gastronomic extravaganza~The dinner started off with the friendly wait-staff guiding us to a spacious 4 dinner Teppanyaki room, whereby cheerful chefs greeted us with an impressive array of precious seafood in a wooden box. It was not long before the chef started to perform his magic through transforming these fresh foods into divine dishes that were simply irresistible. We had uni, snapper, lobster, caviar, wagyu, abalone just to name a few. And they are all insanely delectable. The dessert was refreshing and unique, something I would crave for after a while...All in the all, Waku Ghin is a gourmet's dream come true. Since life's selection of tantalizing experiences are far and few, Wak Ghin is certainly one that is not to be missed

Waku Ghin offers a 10-course degustation menu with a private chef to prepare each dish in front of you to delight your senses. The restaurant offers modern European-Japanese Cuisine with the finest ingredients. We have come here on many occasions and each time we have enjoyed the service and the food. The consistency in execution is to be well-commended.This time round we started the course with the Oysters, Royale with Ginger & Rice Vinegar and Gillardeau with Lemon.Followed by Waku Ghin's signature dish Marinated Botan Ebi with Sea Urchin & Oscietra Caviar. The varying textures combined with the balance of sweet, fresh & saltiness of the caviar was done to perfection. This dish makes me want to dine here again & again.We were then served the John Dory from New Zealand with Roasted Eggplant. This fish was slow cooked in a pan rather than a water bath to keep the fish's freshness. It was moist but still can smell a hint of Smokiness.The steamed Alaskan King Crab with Lemon Scented Extra Virgin Olive Oil was perfectly done. The Alaskan King Crab was placed on a bed of sea salt which water was poured to steam the crab. The result was a perfectly cooked Alaskan King Crab leg which was juicy and tender.We always enjoyed the Australian Abalone with Fregola & Tomato. The basil leaves & tomato was a perfect combination with the abalone which was cooked on a hot plate. The tanginess worked so well with the freshness of the abalone.This was followed by another decadent dish of Braised Canadian Lobster with White Miso. The lobster was cooked perfectly. You wouldn’t usually match lobster with white miso but it works beautifully since the white miso brings out the sweetness of the lobster.The main event was the Charcoal Grilled Fillet of Tasmanian Cape Grim Beef. Cooked medium rare, this fine piece of beef is juicy, very little fat but has enormous flavours. Even by itself it is packed full of flavour and when complemented with Tetsuya’s Wasabi Mustard it is a match made in heaven.Our Sampi Pasta dish was a special request we made. The pasta was cooked Al Dente and then covered in Scampi Oil. The Sampi Oil is made by the restaurant from grape seed oil (healthy!) and the reduction of many kilos of scampi heads and shells. It takes a lot of effort to make a very small amount and it smells and tastes Great!!!We finished the savoury dishes with our favourite tea Gyokuro served at 40C to clean the palate.The desserts at Waku Ghin have improved since we were there 1 year ago especially by bringing in the Spanish Dessert Chef from Santos. This time round our pre-dessert was Cold Soup of Strawberry with Lychee Granita & Coconut Ice-Cream. The extremely light pre-dessert was well balanced with the sourness of the strawberries, sweetness of the lychee and the coconut flavour.The Ghin Cheese Cake was light and airy. The cream consistency along with the lemon flavours was a great dessert which wasn’t too heavy.Our Finale was the Chocolate Mousse Cake with Vanilla Ice-Cream & Macadamias. The mousse was light & airy but still kept the decadent chocolate flavour.We even enjoyed the Petit Fours especially the Matcha Truffle & the Chocolate with Mandarin Cream. Spending SGD 400 per person is quite pricey but all worth it!!

Despite its setting above a casino, Waku Ghin is one of the finest dining experiences I've had, ever, period: Ambiance. Service. Cuisine. On arrival, we saddled up to the bar for a quick drink. In response to my girlfriend's request for "something fruity and sweet," the bartender thought for a brief moment before whipping up a delicious blended-blueberry something. There was alcohol in it, to be sure. But we couldn't tell what it was. A perfect drink.Dinner was prepared before us, teppanyaki style, by a single chef who tended to us for the duration of the meal. He was charming and engaging without being overbearingly chatty. Our ten courses included the following: (I missed a few items here, to be sure, as the sake flowed on... see full menu in pic below)- yellow tail- sea urchin- ocean trout with seaweed- abalone with rocket and Fregula pasta from Sardinia - lobster with bisque and tarragon - Tasmanian grass fed tenderloin aged 90 days with rocket and wasabi mustard- New Zealand red snapper- Mont Blanc with vanilla ice creamAll of it fresh and beautifully presented, yet simple: no foam bubbles anywhere to be seen! We washed ours down with a bottle of cold sake and some sparkling water. Waku Ghin is not cheap. But the (master) chef has earned his reputation and, in this case, does not fail to deliver once again. Bring your wallet and a healthy appetite! (oh and a shawl or wrap: the Aircon is quite strong!

Great food for a special occasion. The chef was able to accommodate to some special diet requirements e.g. No beef, etc. Dessert was served in a lounge overlooking the bay offering a fascinating view. On exit, one gets a even more fascinating view of all the filled up gaming tables at the lower floors

How to rate a restaurant that serves great food which however made us sick later that night?! We went to Waku Ghin last week, the concierge of our hotel highly recommended the place and most people on Trip Advisor liked it very much, so we gave it a try. We had a great evening with really nice food; we recognized most comments previous visitors wrote on TA: too expensive but good. Things went wrong later that night when I found my husband with his head in the toilet pot. The SIN$ 1.100 dinner came back out again

This restaurant is something for a very special occasion. It is very expensive but the tasting menu (you cannot order anything else) is excellent. The dishes are prepared in front of you and the ingredients are shown beforehand. From abalone, via sea urchin, soups, lobster and steak - there is something for everybody. Also special requests are catered today without any issues. The dessert is then presented in a special room from where you have a view on the marina. I really enjoyed the experience but the prices are a all the way up there

This restaurant offers a dining experience which is comparable only with the best. It is the 39th Best Restaurant in the World and the experience here is world class. We have eaten at many Michellin rated restaurants in France and the UK and this restaurant by Tetsuya Wakuda more than holds it own. The meal opens with each couple having a chef working opposite in teppanyaki style, four people to a room. There the tepanyaki resemblance ends, the chef discussing each dish and presenting it with matching wines on a degustation basis. After 9 courses with matching wines, one proceeds to the open section of the restaurant to enjoy two delicious desserts followed by coffee or tea and petit fours.We were lucky enough to meet Tetsuya in the kitchen after our meal and this was really the meal of a lifetime. Try it

First time to try this restaurant according to #39 of World best restaurant , overall impressive and good job Since arrived the restaurant , warm and polite welcome greeting that I can feel , Atmostphere very good as a fine dinning restaurant should be Chef table price truly expensive , but the quality of food material were good , nice presentation and explanation of every course they served , one private table only serve guest more than 6 ppl which privately Foods so tastely and high quality , the beverages were so expensive as well , couldn't find a cheap one , then I had to ordered almost cheapest one Sake 165 SGD (75ml)However , the overall of that night was enjoy and unforgettabl

The uni (sea urchin) with caviar and crab meat is out of this world. This is their signature dish. The other dishes are all similarly very good. It is slightly pricey though, at around S$500 a person without wine, that is around US$ 400 a person. But for that special occasion, birthday, anniversary, I think it is worth it
5
From the get go it was a sublime experience.The dining experience is very much ingredient focussed. A lot of places these days lay claim to being just that.Waku Ghin however is the true mascot of that philosophy "Ingredient Focussed".The pairing that was recommended and organised by Mr. Francesco "Flamboyance" Galdeano was spot on for every course.A truly excellent experience overall.Will be back the next time I am in town.Kudos to Chef Kok who was our chef for the evening. He was very knowledgeable and made us feel comfortable

Having dined at Tetsuyaâ€™s in Sydney, my husband and I had high expectations for Waku Ghin.Waku Ghin offers an exquisite 10-course degustation menu created from some of the best seasonal produce imported from Japan and Australia. We absolutely loved the Japanese and European flavours and were completely blown away by the food. To some extent, we actually prefer Waku Ghin over Tetsuya's. The sommelier was very knowledgeable and gave us some very good recommendations from their extensive wine list.Guests are seated in front of a teppanyaki bar and the food is prepared right in front of your eyes by the chef. Our favourite dish was none other than the signature marinated Botan shrimp with sea urchin and caviar which was just sensational. The ocean trout, pigeon and the wagyu beef were also superb. We're rather surprised to read the negative reviews. In our opinion, Waku Ghin is definitely one of the best restaurants in Singapore and the world even. Sure it's expensive but the dining experience including the food, presentation and service is unparalleled. Our only complaint is that the restaurant decor lacks imagination but then again, you're there for the food not the furniture

The signature dish "marinated shrimp with sea urchin and caviar" is the only memorable dish in the set menu. The other dishes were excellent on the night of our visit, and used first-class ingredients (Alaskan king crab; Tasmanian abalone; lobster; Japanese, not Australian, wagyu steak; etc), but NONE was sublime, the way they should be in a restaurant of this calibre.Great efforts were undertaken to make the experience personal: one chef in charge of each small-ish tepan room; high ratio of waiters to guests; personalised menu. However, the generally excellent service was not without glitches: my companion's glass of still water was refilled with fizzy water, and they charged S$20++ per person for water! I was presented with the credit card and credit card slip of another guest!!!So, overall, an excellent dining experience. But, at US$500 per person (if you have one of the cheapest wines or sakes on the menu, and including service and taxes), it should have been more amazing

We travelled to Singapore purely to eat here, and although it was good, it was by no means the best dining experience we have ever had, and I felt quite let down after paying the absolutely exorbitant bill. We were prepared to pay, and would not have begrudged one cent of it had it been as good as we hoped, but it simply wasn't. The service was attentive, at some times too much so - having the famously $20 glass of water topped up every time you take a sip was annoying, but for the most part the staff were faultless. I found the atmosphere quite sterile, and I couldn't agree more with a previous reviewer who found the lack of music disconcerting, when conversation lapsed, the silence was profound. And the food ... it was all good, but I simply struggle to remember anything other than the sea urchin which was stunning, and the abalone which was not! I think that says it all, sadly
2
Expensive ingredients cooked up quickly. The chef was concentrating solely on cooking coming across as robotic. During the wagyu course, another chef came in to help but ended up chatting with the chef. It is a collection of elite ingredients such as abalone and lobster prepared simply and displayed pretentiously. The room seats a group of people at the teppan counter and it was simply awkward during the many waiting minutes with no music. Disappointed that water is $20 per person and a sip during dessert left a bitter after taste. It appears that rich businessmen with money to flaunt are the clientele rather than food lovers. Nothing stood out except the price

We enjoyed our first Tetsuya experience in his Sydney restaurant for our anniversary in December. My partner surprising me for my birthday last week with a trip to Singapore and a booking at Tetsuya's latest venture - Waku Ghin. Waku Ghin is completely unique - I understand why there are so many varying reviews.Those seeking a sublime culinary dining "experience" will love it... those seeking anything else will walk away disappointed.Yes, it is expensive... but the quality service and food surpasses anything you will find in a swanky French restaurant. It's simple really - if you're not willing to pay, don't make the booking!Waku Ghin offers a set degustation menu, with 3 couples (6 guests) seated around a teppanyaki bar, interacting with their own personal chef throughout the evening. It is a rare occasion for a chef to show you the food he is preparing and cooking for you, let alone telling you the secrets of how he is doing it!I find the reports of food poisoning hard to believe. The food is fresh... so fresh in some occasions it is still alive when presented to the chef in front of you. Seafood and meat from Australia is flown in every 2 - 3 days.Highlights of our meal included the signature dish - sea urchin and caviar - which was a complete taste sensation, and the Cape Grim beef - we have never, and probably will never again, enjoy steak as tender and tasty as that piece of meat.THANK YOU Tetsuya for another very special evening... you're doing Australia proud

My husband and I had three days in Singapore and didn't want to miss Waku Ghin. We were impressed with the attentive but discreet service. Staff were friendly when we initiated conversation. The decor is stark but not too cold. All of the food was impressive. The presentation of fresh seafood in a crate before preparation was a nice touch. We requested and received a tour of the immaculate kitchen. We were lucky to enjoy a laser show over the bay while enjoying dessert. We were offered extra petite fours and couldn't resist. Don't miss the coffee. All in all a brilliant experience but I do think it's overpriced. We knew what it was going to cost before-hand so weren't surprised. The bill was $1200 for two people including a glass of champagne, one of wine, a bottle of wine and extra petite fours (don't know if this cost extra). The personalised menu to take home was a lovely touch. I would recommend this restaurant to others for a special occasion

Yes, it is very expensive (SG$400 per head), however it both met and in some cases surpassed our expectations. It has been a while since we have been to Tetsuya’s Sydney restaurant and we always found the food to be a mix of good and great dishes. At Waku Ghin we are at another level, the food is absolutely fantastic. The regional emphasis of the food here is Japanese rather that Australian. The whole experience is taken to a new level with the “private” kitchen and dining room for all courses up to desert. Your chef for the night prepares and cooks most of the courses in front of you, providing commentary on what is being prepared, where it comes from and answers any questions. Our chef was a young Malaysian from Melaka, he was happy to explain each dish as he prepared it.The signature dish, Marinated Botan Shrimp with Sea Urchin and Oscietra Caviar was a triumph – my partner, never one to be too experimental with food is now a convert to both Sea Urchin and Oscietra.With the exception of the Abalone (a food that has never caught our imagination) we thought the whole meal was fantastic. Our dishes included Pan fried Ayu (fish) with Daikon and Fennel, Braised Canadian Lobster with Tarragon, Charcoal Grilled Fillet of Tasmanian Grass Beef (Cape Grimm) with Tetsuya’s Wasabi Mustard and Japanese Ohmi Wagu Roll from Shiga Prefecture with Wasabi and Citrus Soy.Green tea called Gyokuro is the final course before you move to the more relaxed desert lounge. The excellent deserts (Soup of Strawberry with Lychee and Coconut and Ghin Cheesecake) is follow by generous quantities of devine Petit Fours with tea or coffee.Given our experience on this visit, it is very likely that we will be back the next time we are in Singapore.Highly recommended for a unique, fabulous and memorable meal

We had a night out at Waku Ghin on the 23rd of September 2012 for my husband's 39th birthday, We had 5 guests so we fitted around the teppinyaki style table easily. It was a bit awkward at first as there was no music and as we were all sitting next to each other, table conversation was difficult. We all soon forgot about this however when our chef came out and introduced himself. This guy was amazing, he answered all our questions (believe me, there were A LOT) all the while preparing us an array of beautiful dishes. The food was excellent, I tried a few things that I hadn't before (which is rare as we eat out a lot). The food was very different to Tetsuya's Sydney restaurant, much more Japanese in style.We were lukcy enough to get a tour of the pristine kitchen before we made our way to the ''dessert room'' for another 3 courses of desserts (one was a birthday cake surprise...) along with coffee, tea and petit fours (and in our case a beautiful bottle of dessert wine)Yes it is expensive but the attention to detail and service is worth it. The staff even cleaned and boxed up our abalone shells after the meal so we could take them home with us to Australia, nothing was too much trouble.An unforgettable experienc

Clear some space on your credit card and don't miss this on your stop in Singapore.This is a dining experience like no other, its like having a very personal fancy dinner party, in your own flashy kitchen,(if you had one;)with a world class chef.If you have been to Tetsuyas in Sydney then you must go here....We had 5 guests, which was perfect to fit in one of the smaller rooms around the teppen. We had a really cool chef with a great sense of humour who explained everything and answered all our, I'm sure, tedious questions! But this guy was AMAZING, we wanted to know everything he was doing!The 10 courses sound like a lot but the food is light, yet still multi faceted. There is no choice with food except dietary requirements, to which they are very obliging. So some things may not be what you would normally order, but it's all about the ingredient experience rather than eating for hunger.Everything is prepared with great precision and care and fastidious order and cleanliness you would expect from Japanese fine dining. These chefs take their craft very seriously. Truly something to be witnessed. The service from all staff was impeccable as it should be in a place like this.We were very lucky to be given a tour of the large kitchen, before our desert courses. It was like an immaculate surgery. Just amazing.The only weird thing about this place is there is no music. Makes you kind of feel like you are there before its opened. Would be nice for some atmosphere. A big Thankyou to the staff at Tetsuyas Waku Ghin for making a birthday celebration one to remember
5
My wife and I are big fans of tetsuyas in Sydney so deliberately stopped over in Singapore to experience this.The food was divine and it is a great dining experience. 10 courses over a few hours finishing with dessert in the dessert room.We will definitely go back next time ee are in Singapore
5
4 of us were lucky enough to eat here on August 22. Amazing food / staff. We had KAZ as our chef. Great young man and very knowledgeable re the food etc. If l could afford to eat here once a month l would. One off experience
5
Access was tricky, lifts behind Hermes. We had our own room which served 4 and our own chef to prepare in front of us, modern teppanyaki style. The uni and cavier was exquisite, out of this world, the abalone presentation was also understanding. The fish was delicate but the three servings of beef was one too many, each was wonderful but come the 3rd sliver, the experience was waning. The food service was excellent and the chefs engaging but we had limited interaction with anyone other than those directly serving us.All in all, it was a thoroughly enjoyable dinner we will remember for the food and the company. You can't enjoy this except for really special occassions, which I will look forward to again

I don't know if there is a fish market just behind this restaurant.... but all i can say is. -->>>WOW<<<--. The ingredients were super super super fresh! Did i forget to say super super super? :) I frequent very high end Japanese restaurants all over the world that serve really fresh seafood but this place presents one of the tastiest i have ever tried in my entire life. In terms of creativity.... they are just one step below Iggy's. However, with every bite/spoon i take, it leaves me wanting for more. So much that i had to ask my mom and sister in law for their serving!! Thank God, women eat too little hehe. The dinner was a 10-11 course degustation but it felt like a 5 course one sigh..... that's probably why most reviewers here rate the value 3 to 4 stars only. One of the last dishes served in this place was the A5. For those who have no clue of what it is, its a sirloin steak (actually they serve strips only since its so expensive) that's very very lean but can beat any Wagyu's softness if it had the same proportion or thickness. The interiors are also a step down from Hongkong's L'ATELIER de Joël Robuchon. However, you'll be amazed with the Teppan table. It was spotless! You'll find out how they keep it in mint condition when you go there. For those thinking of bringing a date, i suggest you eat somewhere else. The degustation here is like a tour. When we came here, we had to wait in the "lobby" while they were preparing the room. Once we finished with dinner, we were led to another location within the restaurant for dessert and coffee. The moving about wouldn't help if you and your special other were into a very intimate and long conversation. There's just too many interruptions especially with the teppanyaki guy/ sou chef doing his cooking. Overall, i would say this is the place to be when you want to surprise your friends or family who have the budget and have no clue of what's in here. I'd probably be willing to visit this place again if i have the money or not really that hungry. If all else fails, I'm going to McDonald's afterwards haha

If you like (superfresh - oysters, lobster etc all are shown to you still alive) seafood this is the place to be in Singapore! But also for supertender wagyu beef. A 10 course (set)diner without being completely stuffed, some courses come from the kitchen but most are made on the tepanyaki in your private dining room. I didn't get the course after having had beef going back to a fishsoup but that's the only negative comment i can thinking off. Desert in a seperate room with comfy chairs. A great (yet expensive) experience and should you have any cash left hit the casino one floor below but better is to top it off with a digestive and a great view over Singapore in the skybar KuDeTa - all at Marina Bay Sands. You will enjoy it

I cannot recommend enough that you STAY AWAY from this restaurant. I took my husband there for his birthday dinner on a Saturday night. In the early hours of the morning after, he began feeling very ill and subsequently was terribly sick for 48 hours. He had to go to the doctor on Monday as we were worried about dehydration, he could keep nothing down. I alerted the restaurant to the problem on the Sunday morning. The only contact number goes through to a central revervation system with a voicemail recording. I left a polite message advising that one of their diners last night had developed food poisoning, and they would probably like to check with both their suppliers and kitchen staff to make sure no-one else suffered. I left my contact details and asked them to call me back. I wanted to know if anyone else was sick that evening. I wasn't even especially angry: food poisoning, while extremely unfortunate, can happen at the best of establishments with seafood and human error. By afternoon I still hadn't heard back from them and I left another polite message. I assumed the line wasn't staffed on a Sunday. I also sent an email as an extra precaution. By mid-morning Monday I'd still not heard back so called again. Again got the voicemail recording, left another message. Sent another email. On Wednesday, I got an email from the restaurant offering us a free dinner. What?! We didn't want or ask for a free dinner; in fact I will never go there again. All we wanted was for someone to care enough about the guest that they had charged over $1,000 and left vomiting for 2 days, having ruined his birthday celebration, to actually call and discuss the situation and make sure it didn't happen to anyone else. I find this absolutely deplorable. To this day I can't read anything about 'celebrity chef' Tetsuya without thinking what a bad person he must be; and what a culture he must be instilling in his staff and restaurants. This review is overdue, but I wasn't reviewing for Tripadvisor at the time it happened. I still want to warn people now. It's not the fact that my husband got food poisoning, as bad as that was; it's the fact that not one person at the restaurant had the courtesy, care, respect or basic professionalism to call for more details and information to hopefully prevent it from happening to any of their other patrons. Dine their at your peril

A great restaurant that is pricey but is a dining experience with wonderful friendly respectful and knowledgeable staff. We had a great meal that will be remembered for quite some time, but even better was the conversations with the sommelier and the restaurant manager. Thank you for a great evening.Our only negative is that we were told to gain access to the restaurant through the casino. This was a big mistake as you are constantly having your passport checked and the passport is a smokey smelly noisy place that is not of the quality of the restauran

For the price that we are paying, we are expecting more than just fresh quality food. The few memorable dish we had was the appetizer made with Uni, botan shrimps and good caviar. The combination of salty caviar brings out the sweetness of the uni and shrimps.... divine. The other was the Omi beef from Japan. It is well marbled and grilled slightly plain with a pinch of salt. The taste was sweet and has a pleasant fragrance without the need for any seasoning. The meat was very tender and the fat just melts in the mouth. This is the next best thing to Kobe beef which we can never find outside of Japan. Lastly, the sake that was recommended by the sommelier was excellent. We could not have enough of it. Food wise, it is definitely above the average sushi restaurant but in terms of creativity, is was a tad predictable. The restaurant has a very sombre ambiance and the chef is very serious and quiet. Not a place for playful banter or party unless you book the whole place. It is definitely romantic enough to bring a date to

I have dined at most of the San Pel 50 and was quite looking forward to an innovative experience at Waku Ghin following a glowing review from a fellow foodie, but was a little hesitant given that it was in MBS and thus created to cater to the brash crowd that frequent this destination. I will describe the 4 components that pull a restaurant together seperately. Ambience, Food, Drinks and Service (not in any order of preference)Ambience- Pleasently decorated the segregated dining experience can be a bit of a hit or miss dependent on whom you have as your dining companions. 5 people in a segregated room for 8 courses glued to a Tepan table with the chefs commentary and no music, can mean that the 3 Russian speakers constantly requring explanations about what each ingredient is from a not fully articulate staff could either be a comedy or very cruel torture. For us it was indifferent as we were focussed on not being disturbed, but I can definitely see the downside to this arrangement.Food-Great delivery of some very well cooked if not technically complicated dishes. Given the same quality of ingrediants it would not take a culinary genius to put this together.The Abalone was truly tyre like though and Michelin may well prove to ask this restaurant for some tips on the other side of there business. The beef and lobster were beautiful and the Uni with Caviar and prawns, was very clever combining. Our chef was a plesure. exert s a major let down.Drinks- The wine by the glass selection is weak and the lack of a paired menu disappointing at this level. They tried very hard to up sell and get us to order a bottle of white and red, but as I was the only drinker of the two of us this was never going to happen. I did manage 6 glasses of different wines and the Torbreck was definitely a winner (Well done David Powell again). On the whole a collection of overpriced overly marked up wines aimed at the typical crowd who would be more driven by labels then a sound sommelier who could point you in the right direction. (When I fesiously asked what part of France my desert wine was from, I received a blank look, which was strange as a Sauternes can not b fro any where else) At this level and these prices a little training will not go far a miss.Service - Poor, badly in need of additional training and completely the ultimate let down for this restaurant. The staff generally needed to probably dine in true fine dining establishments, be given lessons in eloquence and understanding of what they are supposed to be doing and then let out on the training floor. This was an unacceptable element of the meal. Lack of knowledge was evident at every turn.Overall- At USD 1000++ for 2 people this was definately poor value. You can only rest on your laurels for so long Mr. Tetsuya. If this left the San Pel List i would imagine it would close in a year

It was a dinner for a real special occasion. For a dinner that is more than S$500 per person without wine, I had expected the dining experience to have sent my spouse and I to the stars and back. The food is undoubtedly imaginatively executed and tasted fabulous at every dish. 5 stars for food quality. We were not sure we got value for our buck though. That is very subjective matter especially if trying to compare amongst restaurants in this end of the spectrum. As for the atmosphere, we did not enjoy sitting on a high chair (uncomfortable for thighs and lower back) at a open teppanyaki table with 2 other couples throughout dinner , and the conversations are audible to everyone else at the table. Maybe we are more conservative. Maybe it was also how sound travels around a small room and across a stainless steel surface. If you are planning on having a dinner where you can also enjoy your private couple space for intimate conversations then this dining concept may not be for you. It is a matter have having the correct expectations. Overall, it was a great meal and memorable creativity, however I do not think I will come back again for a while until the dining concept is tweaked

My husband and I were i Singapore for a night before heading to our final destination Australia. My father in law made a reservation for this restaurant for me and my hubby and paid upfront for the menu as a gift for us. The menu was supposed to be tasting menu accompanied with wine for each course. After reading all the great reviews about Tetsuya and how great his restaurants were and after seeing the price of 1000 $ for a 10 course menu I really was expecting something extraordinary before coming to this restaurant. I was so disappointed. We sat down and got offered a glass of water and got served our first appetizer. I immediately thought - were is the wine which was supposed to go with our menu? Their English (believe it or not) was not that good (or did they pretend not to understand?) and it took them a while to see what we asked for. They said they had to check with their colleagues whether or not the wine was ordered!!! So we ended up waiting for them for the whole 15 min with the appetizer in front of us (we didn't know whether we should start eating it or wait for the wine) so that they could check whether or not we had wine ordered. For this much money I would expect the staff to be more professional in their handling of clients. They came back after a while with yet another colleague who, again (did pretend?), did not understand what we asked them about. In the end, after the whole 20 min of back and forth they finally agreed - yes, the wine was offered with your meal when you had purchased it...Wow - no sorry, nothing! So the dinner really started off bad, we had to argue to get what we had ordered, what un unpleasant start to what was supposed to be a high quality dining!In the end, the food was ok but definitely not extraordinary for what you would expect after paying so much money. The only original dish I liked was sea urchin - their signature dish I believe. Also, the waiters were not attentive and you had to wait for them to take plates once you finish a course

We had dinner at Waku Ghin in June 2012. We had the standard 10-course meal together with champagne throughout the meal.The meal started well with an orange-infused tataki of katsuo and the signature appetizer with uni, raw botan ebi and oscietra caviar. Both of these dishes were very good and similar in style and taste to what you would expect at a Nobu restaurant. You cannot get food that is much better than this anywhere in the world so we were in foodie paradise at this stage and expected this to be one of the best meals of our life.Unfortunately, the meal went downhill from this excellent start. We got a very bland and forgettable pan-fried fillet of Ayu followed by an overly rubbery teppan fried abalone served with what tasted like a standard tomato and basil pasta sauce. We suspect that the abalone would have scored higher points with the tyre making division at Michelin than with the firm’s famous restaurant critics. These two dishes were not to our liking and we braced ourselves for what was to follow. Luckily the dinner took a turn for the better with teppan fried lobster and two different beef dishes. These three dishes were all good, and based on premium ingredients, but the dishes were not memorable in any way (luckily we got a copy of the menu together with the bill – otherwise we would have struggled to remember the dishes). At this point, our meal at Waku Ghin felt too much like an ordinary teppanyaki experience. The savoury part of the meal was finished off with a somewhat boring consommé of rice and snapper followed by exclusive gyokuro first-flush tea.After this we transferred from the teppan counter to the dining hall overlooking Marina Bay. We finished off the meal with two forgettable French-style inspired desserts followed by mignardises.In conclusion, this was a good meal and the Osaka-born chef was excellent. However, at this price level we expect a more consistent experience and above all we think that a majority of dishes should be memorable. Sadly this was not the case and I do not think we will return

Most incredible dining experience....every course was special...the sea urchin was super....as was the alaskan lobster....the teppanyaki chef was proffessional and charismatic...every course had me feeling that it was unique and flavourful and the best so far...until the next one came along!!!And just when we thought it cdnt get any better...we were ushered into the desert salon for more amazing delights....even the petit four was divine...in spite of the steep prices, I cant recommend it highly enough...I wd do it all over again in a heartbeat!!The stunning ambience and fabulous wine selection doesnt hurt either!

The best dining experience in Singapore. Exquisite ingredients and presentation and fabulous to watch the chef cooking in front of you. Tetsuya was there as well so the experience was complete.

Love, Love, Love this place. Would have to say it was the best dinning experience of my life! A magical evening of taste sensations, best wine list I have ever seen and can not wait to get back

I have experienced Tet's restaurant back in the hay days when he was on the other side of the bridge in a very small funky restaurant and he was a master of degerstation menu back then. When he moved over the bridge to Sydney CBD you knew that Tetsuya was becoming famous for his dining experience. So with our trip to Singapore last year we quickly booked a spot at Waku Ghin as it is a massive wait. So book well ahead. WOW it was the most incredible experience and meal ever. 10 courses and a take home box of truffles. I do not eat meat, so I was looked after well and my partner so did enjoy his 2 meat dishes and commented best ever meat dishes. The wine list is so extensive and the cost of alcohol is not cheep at all in Singapore and it was a night we were happy just to eat and enjoy the journey. It is not a cheap night out, so do take the cheque book as much more than the Sydney restaurant. But if you are a fan of Tet's then it is a must do at Singapore. You are so well looked after and it is so personal, that no one can beat what Waku Ghin does, well not found any better as yet. The ambience is an experience also

Our visit to Waku Ghin was unplanned, and having failed to reserve tables at Tetsuya's in Sydney several time, to be able to reserve a table at such a short notice was a good start. We were led to a private cubicle and the Maitre d'hotel started asking if there was any ingredient we were not consuming that night and if we liked some drinks to start with.The restaurant feels very private and classy, but not too extravagantly luxurious. We had 10 different course of the Best French Japanese Fusion Meals. Every course was both mouth-and-eye-watering, each perfectly portioned. Scallop, Sea Urchin with oscietre caviar, Bamboo Clam, Ayu with braised withlof, Abalone with fregola,Blackmore Wagyu and Tasmanian truffles were served in order. Each course has its own distinct taste and blend and with each course, the excitement just grows. To add to the excitement, Mr. Tetsuya himself came in to greet and accompany us, he explained briefly about the motive behind his first move outside Australia. Such a great gesture from the connoisseur. Surely this was easily one of the best culinary journey we have ever experienced. We had several good drinks to accompany the perfect meals including Gyokuro, the unique Japanese green tea made from selected young green tea leaves, Masuizumi, unpasteurized Junmai Ginjo made specially for Tetsuya's, Yalumba Viognier and 2001 Torbreck Grenach. To wind up the already a wonderful dinner, we were brought to a common area overlooking the Singapore Marina Bay where fireworks happened to be in display with Singapore skyline as the backdrop. Granita of Kyoho Grapes, Cheesecakes and petit four are served as desserts. Perfect Finish.The whole experience was considerably expensive, outrageously expensive by Singapore standard some may say but well worth it if it were for a special occasion. It is still a good value otherwise in my opinion. An example of culinary perfection and I would gladly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a fabled gastronomic journey

I had to email to get a reservation beforehand and the restaurant is not that easy to find. However, the meal there was spectacular and on par with the 3 Michelin starred restaurants in New York. First of all we had a private room where the chef only served us. He explained every dish thoroughly and answered any questions we had.We started with a flan of salmon row from Hokkaido served in warm soup. The roe was perfect and the flan was great. Next was the sea urchin with fresh botan ebi from Canada topped with oestra caviar. The dish was fishy, salty and tasted perfect. The shrimp tasted like they were cooked, even though they were raw, and the sweetness of the shrimp balanced the brininess of the sea urchin and caviar.Next was the New Zealand John Dory with eggplant and sumi yaki sauce. The fish was perfectly cooked as was the eggplant, and the ginger taste came through in the dish. The French foie gras with South African mango was seared and spectacular. The mango added a perfect amount of sweetness to the richness of the foie gras and this was one of best foie gras that I have ever had.The seared Tasmanian abalone with pasta and tomato sauce was cooked perfectly and was a little peppery. The tomatoes and pasta added a nice contrast to the abalone. The pasta was perfectly al dente, and arugula added bitterness to the dish. The last seafood dish was Canadian lobster that was cooked with olive oil, garlic, shallots and topped with fresh tarragon. The lobster was fresh and sweet and the broth from the olive oil, garlic, and shallots was amazing. Our next savory course was Wagyu beef with fresh grated wasabi, garlic chips and spring onion. This was the best wagyu beef I've ever tasted. The meat was cut into cubes and cooked perfectly medium rare. The fresh wasabi was mild and perfect for the meat, which melted in my mouth. The final savory course was chicken stock with Japanese snapper and rice porridge. The fish was tender, the broth was great and the rice added a nice vehicle for both the broth and the fish.We moved to another room for dessert, which was granita of Kyoto grape. The granita was very sweet and the grape was great. This was a refreshing dessert. As we ate dessert, we looked over the harbor and across Singapore. The view was amazing as was the food

Dinner at Tetsuya Wakuda's venture "Waku Ghin" in Singapore. There are two seatings per night and the first must have been running late as there was a 10-15 minute wait at the bar.The restaurant is divided into a series of rooms each with seats at a counter and large teppan. The majority of the dishes are cooked on the teppan in front of you by a single chef through the evening. Desserts are served in a single larger room with regular tables and a view of the bay.The dish highlights were the Crushed potato with smoked eel, Marinated Botan Ebi with Sea Urchin and Oscietre Caviar, Steamed Alaskan King Crab with Yuzu scented Extra Virgin Olive Oil and Braised Canadian Lobster with Tarragon.Service was excellent - friendly and well informed.I would recommend it as the food is utterly brilliant, easily among my favourites from the trip, I just wish it wasn't so expensive

If it wasn't it was certainly in the top 5. OK it was eye wateringly expensive for Singapore ($400 Sing for food alone) but the ingredients were the best quality in the world, they were beautifully cooked and presented and in a lovely intimate environment. Frankly I would rather have one fabulous meal like that than a dozen ho hum meals. Particular standouts were the signature dish of Sea Urchin with Oscietra caviar, the Alaskan King Crab cooked on the teppan on salt and the wagyu with fresh wasabi. We did have some excellent wine to accompany the food but it seemed almost redundant because of the subtle complexity of the flavours. In a word - superb

There's so much to say - where do I even start? The whole dinner was a very interesting (and positive) experience indeed.We booked a degustation (priced at S$500 per pax) for two. The hosts were impeccably polite and polished. We were led to a teppanyaki-styled dining area which seats about 6 pax. The ambience was nice and cozy, with nice marble table-tops.As it was a degustation menu, it was pretty much "fixed". However, the chefs were attentive and checked if there was anything which we would like to them replace (i.e some diners may not want beef due to dietary retrictions). The food was exquisite, concocted from the very best and freshest ingredients sourced the world over, e.g botan ebi, abalone, sea urchins, wagyu beef, etc. The presentation was refined and reflected a fusion of Japanese and Western cuision, which underscores the style of each dish. The best dish was the finely sliced Wagyu beef served with freshly ground Wasabi, which definitely left us wanting more!Some of the dishes on the menu were prepared in front of you, where the Chef would cook it on the teppan, to your preference and liking. While the Chef did not demonstrate knife-juggling skills as you would expect in a normal teppan restaurant, he took great care in explaining each dish and how it is best eaten. This made the dining experience all the more enjoyable.The desert was served in a separate room, overlooking Marina Bay. We were treated to an unexpected firework display over the bay, as there were some ongoing celebrations. The Ghin cheesecake, which is their signature dish, was simply yummy! In addition, you could choose up to 4 different kinds of petit fours, all of which were delightfully good. Would definitely visit again, when they have a new seasonal menu

I ate here 2 weeks ago and had such a good experience! They only serve a 10-course degustation menu worth SGD 400. It is pricey but definitely worth it. See my blog entry for details of what I thought about each of the 10 courses:http://goodfoodishappiness.blogspot.com/2011/08/waku-ghin-japanese-fine-dining-and.htmlShould be worth a try for special occasions and that once in a lifetime experience
