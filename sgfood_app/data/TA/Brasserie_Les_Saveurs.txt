Excellent breakfast and fabulous service up to St Regis. Special thanks to Mr. Tajrie Amir for the exquisite attention and recommendations. Without a doubt we will return on our next visit to Singapore

I have booked a table in advance to celebrate my friend's birthday and I felt humiliated by the restaurant's supervisor: Jason. In the whole of my adult life, I have never encountered such embarrassment to an extent that I was shamed in a fine dining restaurant where there were other patrons around. What happened: we were in the midst of enjoying our time, whereas Jason was in a rush to clear the plates on our dining table and splash the entire glass of wine onto me. His reckless strength/behaviour causes the wine glass to fly across the dining table which resulted in me drenched from the tip of my head to my hair/face/neck/dress and ruin our entire joyful dinner night. What actually shocked us was his first reaction running towards me and asks if I needed assistance such as wet tissue? Oh please! (No, I love being soaked in wine - pun intended.) He could see that I was thoroughly wet and mad, his reaction should have been proactive to pass me fresh towels and tissues right away instead of asking me whether do I need a tissue.Shortly after, he escorted me the washroom to clean up because my entire hair, body, dress and even my shoes are drenched with the wine (and YES, I walk to the washroom drenched and look like someone who has caught in the rain in a light colour shirt where once wet with liquid, my undergarments can be seen - whoolala free show). Disastrous, and they did not send a single female staff to the washroom to check if I needed any help. If it helps, there were no towels in the toilet as well hence I can only attend to myself with toilet paper (my oh my in a 5 boutique star hotel). To my dismay, upon my return back into the restaurant, I could not find a single soul (no staff on the ground, zero - not sure if all runners are called into a meeting or what during dinner hours, no servers on the field). We need to stand at our messy and wet table while we wait for all the employees to return to serve. Unacceptable! Definitely not what one would expect from a 5 boutique stars hotel – St Regis.The first staff who came back to the ground (after a disappearance act from the entire ground crew) to our "messy & wet table" was the clumsy Jason who ruined my entire night. Yes, the table was still "messy & wet", no one offer to move us to another table (the restaurant was only 50% filled) AND no one clean up the 'messy & wet' tables whilst I was in the toilet showering myself with 'my oh my toilet paper'. Instead of sympathising on the entire bad situation or rendered any additional help to relieve my situation, he came back with a bottle of white wine as compensation. I was honestly distress and so afraid that he might just splash another round of wine showering service on me in public, I declined. In such situation, I'd have expected the higher management aka the manager to be apologetic and come forth immediately instead of having me to request for one.After waiting for a good whole 10minutes, Manager Kartie has shown up emptied-handed apart from his name cards. During the 10minutes wait, shouldn't someone brief him with a summary of the disaster and come along with some towels (at this point, we really could use some towels, are they extinct!?). Nothing, the first thing he did was to hand me his name card and appeared to be ignorant about what has happened until he saw the "wet & messy table" + a drenched me. I wonder if this is St Regis' protocol, to hand out name card without acknowledging an emergency situation first? So may I assume in the event if I slip and fall and it is caused by one of the staff, will Manager Kartie come out and hand me his name card while I am bleeding profusely? Again I was dumbfounded by the service of the restaurant's team.I was not surprised, the staff were completely unaware of our discomfort level staying at the same old messy & wet table. I (with a saint mind) open my mouth to request for a switch to a clean and dry table when at the point of time - the restaurant has plenty of unoccupied tables (50% occupancy).As our conversation continues, (with every bit of saint mind leftover) we need to prompt Kartie instead of him having to initiate to offer the simplest form of compensation:- Laundry services- Proper clean up place Our mood is completely ruin to the maximum when we could not feel any initiative coming from your staff. I have to endure through the remaining meals in my wet outfit that see through my undergarment because I see a need to blow the candle with the birthday girl before ending the dinner. We did not accept any offers from your restaurant's staff (since there is no initiative) apart from the fact that the meal was waived. I'd absolutely much prefer having to pay and enjoy the night in my pretty dress, earring, necklace, bag, shoes, etc and takes lots of pictures. Not like this.I have to say, I am badly traumatised over this incident. I still am.

Me my husband had visited the place for about 3 consecutive days during the busy period this week. We had to line up at some time as the restaurant was pretty full.While the whole place is quite a mess and most of the staff were rude, one lady stood up and proved us wrong. Name is Kaye (don’t know if I spelled it correctly) who wowed us for her impeccable service and sweet smile. She’s the real deal especially during those "waiting times". Acknowledging someone in queu and making sure all is ok would always go a long way for us customers. Great location, lovely staff and the food is superb!!!Can’t wait to be back in Singapore again for some more!

It’s the best Sunday brunch I experience in Singapore by far. The service is excellent particularly Vincent, the restaurant manager and Irene, sommelier. Their attention to details is flawless, unafraid and not hesitant to help on anything. Food is fantastic! A plus, is the live music, makes the whole experience more romantic!

Great food, stunning serviceVisited the venue for the dinner. We had semi-buffet dinner and appetisers, main course, ( Must try Cod and Lamb ), and dessert were very tasty.Of course not only food, the service provided was brilliant too.They were all friendly yet kept some distance professionally. Especially we would like to extend appreciation to Sila, Jason and Irene who made our nice dinner experience there. We look forward to coming back to the restaurant to try out different dishes and see them too

On 3rd February 2018, me & Jeremiah held our wedding banquet & solemnisation at Braserrie Les Saveurs over lunch & afternoon tea.The restaurant manager, Ms Zhi Hui, has been the most helpful and service oriented person I've worked with during my wedding planning journey. She always tried her best to accomodate our requests and very responsive even during ungodly hours. ;) I am so very glad that she is able to help us with the customised menu for the lunch buffet and the 3 tier afternoon tea. My vegan friends have expressed their delight at the vegan options provided by the restaurant. Zhi Hui indeed is very thoughtful!!! During the wedding itself, Zhi Hui and the team at Brasserie Les Saveurs tried their best to help us & accomodate us by working with our themes & needs such as the place cards, dessert placements and even down to the speech cocktail table and seats for me. Due to my delicate situation, she is even willing to plate my home cooked meal & white grape juice ( really looks like white wine ) as I am not able to eat any of the items on the menu and consume any wine. All of these at the last minute!The restaurant manager, Zhi Hui even took the time & effort to help us document the beautiful moments! The photos are amazing! Thank you for accomodating our request for the in dining menu as well! The guests definitely enjoyed every single bite & morsel during dinner! It is a beautiful extension of our luncheon celebrations. :)The guests have also expressed that the wine selection is on point for the selected main courses. Definitely great to have the sommelier looking after these minute details with us. :) Even for the morning after, the staff at Brasserie Les Saveurs remembered us when we went down for breakfast & very kindly congratulated us for the celebrations. Thank you St Regis for giving us and the guests a wedding to remember for many years to come. The regal setting of Brasserie Les Saveurs has always been our first choice venue for our wedding & solemnisation! :) Thank you Zhi Hui for being the most friendly & hardworking staff I've met. Definitely impressed with her performance and I look forward to meeting her every year for our many anniversaries celebrations. :

We celebrated my wife's birthday, the table arrangement was very nice in a "private" area and the service was very good from we entered the restaurant.My wife was a bit indecisive between two dishes, but settled for the fish. When the course came, Chef Gordon had made a small tasting sample of the other dish, which was very much appreciated.We were mainly served by Jason Kuia, he was very polite and attentive and provided good service through out the evening. Ms Irene and Sila also did a great job during the eveningThe restaurant surprised my wife with a birthday cake and a song, which was very nice. The Price level is fair and according to expectations for such a venue, menu and service Overall a very good evening and we will defiantly come again

We attended an anniversary dinner and were served by Christopher. He made the dining experience a wonderful one with his attentive service and polite yet warm demeanor. The pianist Amen also came by to say hello after his playing stint and I thought that was wonderful. We enjoyed the ambience of the restaurant and the attentive service by the staff. My fiancé mentioned that the place feels classy and the food is great. She loves the cod fish. The wine is expensive but to be expected for the st Regis brand. I will come back again for the service and the value the place provides. I will recommend this place for a special occasion.

Apart from my company, quite a disappointment for this brunch. Went for one of the champaign brunch packages, and here is my detailed experience at this 5 star facility.I was the first to arrive and waited in fromt of the restaurant for many minutes. It felt like eternity, as you are a bit on the spot on top of the stairs waiting to be seated. It took a long while, and finally a person took me to the table, and was pleasant and charming installing me in the way I could have a good outlook at the restaurant and see my friends when arriving. My friends arrived, and we opted in for the champagne brunch. The first we had to to was to select some main dishes to be served during the meal. I was a bit surprised that I had to indicate exact what time I wanted that, and I therefore did, in hope to manage my starters etc in time without a stressful eating experience. We started and the seafood buffet. I would say that some of the selection were really good, some more average. The condiments were not placed together with the dishes so you would have to spend a lot of time back and forth to get the overview. The small caviar blinis were a show piece, and even without a queue the chef said that we had to order to get. I got one small, with more taste of onions and garnish than the caviar. The shells and the sushi were really good. Since I was at this nice brunch I wanted to have the guilty pleasure of some meat. I went to the meat station and ordered a piece of medium rare meat. I had to wait for this and also this became a really strange experience. It took a while to get a plate at the station, and when I got the meat it was not the best quality hence they said they would deliver what I wanted to the table. When I got this, sorry my expression, but it was not looking like the nice roast at the food station, but a shoe sole that I would never eat. It was full of fat and the least good part of the roast. They apologised and would bring some better meat. Meanwhile I got my pre ordered food, and that was a really delicious dish, and I was again happy about the food. Later, getting full, the waiter came with a perfectly prepared meat dish from the roast for me... this is maybe 45 minutes later than when I first approached the meat station to get my first slice of medium rare meat craving fix. This time, it was the 3rd attempt, and it was looking perfect, but at that time, it was desert time. I wonder how they could even offer me the bad parts of the meat 2 times earlier, filled with sauce and potatoes. Its really like a bad dream. It was not nicely presented, and it actually looked disgusting. So, for a 5 star experience, hey, this needs lots of improvement. During the meal we got good flow of champagne. Two of us drank, but the third person never drink a lot, hence the price for a very moderate drinker might be steep. We moved to the desert part, where we were at the end of the brunch and a lot of food already gone, and no more options. You would expect that its the same options during the brunch and you dont have to run to reserve your piece of pie! The last part, was our end of our brunch, when one of my friends, the one who didn't drink was accused from the staff of being intoxicated. She was actually pointing at the service and quality, but was from your staff waived away. This was a very unpleasant ending of what could have been a wonderful sunday brunch between friends. I would also like to comment that a place like this, feels a bit outdated with a type of attitude and service that is not welcoming in warm and natural way. Perhaps its been corrected since we visited. So, please sort out your food stations, never serve guests with worst part of the meat and shoe soles, and try to secure that its a really warm welcome to your place, not only being seated, but throughout the meal. There were also some embarrassments during the meal, including with some of the other guests. Perhaps the staff that day were in a bad mood. As of interior design, I need to say something as this is always in my reviews on excellent places. It truly feels outdated and wannabe chic. To me its nothing special and feels just hotel. Make it into a proper Brasserie, and you will have amazed guests also for the environment

I proposed to my gf with the help of the restaurant staff including the indoor pianist. They are helpful and coordinate with my plan perfectly, even let me choose the best seat myself including my videographer, indoor pianist also helped me to play my gf favourite song during proposal moment. The overall service is excellent. Food served is good. Thanks BLS! Highly recommend to others to visit this restaurant
5
I visited this place under a friend's recommendation. The food and the ambience were excellent! We got a good window seat at a corner, it was really cosy. Apart from that, the staff did a very good job in attending to us, especially Jason - thank you for your service and food/beverages recommendations
5
The semi-buffet, which included a choice of cordon bleu main courses, was excellent value but it really was the staff, especially Mr Kwai, who were outstanding in their attentiveness and level of service. Many thanks to all the staff for an excellent birthday celebration; she loved it
5
In one word,Its splendid! We spend our wedding anniversary evening at Brasserie les Saveurs.The dinner was so excellent. The crew Irene,Alex and Sila was so pleasant, warm welcoming and keep attention on every minute details. The ambiance were excellent and the food were severed well.The pianist play soothing tunes which were way eximious. Apart from excellent starters,oysters, we love the excellent dessert spread. After paying the bill, Irene approach us as ask about the feedback and check is there any occasion for our visit. So we say that it was our Wedding Anniversary. She congratulate us ask us to wait for a minute. She return with a small cake with lighted candles. Me and and my wife were flabbergasted. It was beyond our expectation. Thanks Irene for the big surprise. Once again, thanks to entire crew, you guys help to make it a memorable day!!

I chose this beautiful place for my girlfriend’s birthday and I am glad I’ve made the right choice. We ordered the Atlantic Cod and the steak as mains, including the buffet spread. Everything was of high standards. The ambience was also excellent, grand yet cosy. Towards the end, a birthday cake was brought to our table and the pianist played the birthday song for my girlfriend. Of course, the good experience was enhanced by this staff by the name of Manish. He is one who serves with his heart, with extraordinary service standard and professionalism. All in all, we dwelled there for close to 2.5 hours, which is a long time considering the fact that I usually have my meals within 15 mins. Definitely would recommend

Had both semi-buffet and ala carte. Irish oysters most expensive of the oyster selection but are smaller than the Aust Rock Oysters. Quite tasty. Ala carte meals served with fresh warm bread. Crispy crust fluffy inside. Very good. Had the Aust Wagyu Kajima steak. Good sized portion 250gm for me. See photos of main meals from semi-buffet and alacarte menu. Ate too slowly so beef steak was tough when cold.Service staff very attentive. Kept you informed of the time main meals will be ready. Gave good recommendations of food.Good selection of red and white wines such pinot noir from Louis Jadot Vineyard.
5
If you want fine food that is prepared to stimulate your taste buds eat at Brasserie Les Saveurs at the St Regis Singapore. Excellent staff and service. Breakfast and lunch are al a carte plus a buffet of side dishes and dessert with each order. We ate here several times.
5
Food was great as always, had a particularly great experience dining at this restaurant today - pleased to be served by Kuai and Manish who went out of their way to ensure we had an enjoyable time at the restaurant. Definitely will be returning
5
My goodness, this may have been extreme gluttony, but it was one of the most memorable dining experiences of my life. Complimentary cocktails at the bar prior to brunch opening was a nice touch, it also gave us a moment to explore the hotel lobby. The buffet selection of cheeses, seafood, sushi, sweets, etc, was almost forgotten due to the amazing plated foods they provide. Which by the way, the plated foods are not only well diversified in flavors, assortments, textures, and types of food, but they are endless in quantity. You need to book for 12pm sharp to have a chance at getting through the entire meal. The champagne was very high-end and my glass never emptied before they refilled it. The Somm even opened the bottle with a sword, which I fully intend on learning and performing at every forced opportunity. Perhaps over the top, but hey, this is a brunch for those who are looking for “over the top.” Overall, this is a very expensive outing, but I felt like it earned every penny with nearly perfect service, presentation, and quality of food and wine. I don’t think I’d go back because it’s once in a lifetime amazing moment; not something I’d try to recreate. That being said, you should do this is you’re into ridiculous opulence and extensive day drinking. I may have passed out the second I got back to my hotel, but I won’t be forgetting that experience any time soon. Great job, BLS!

Really gr8 experience at the restaurant with the best service from Jason Loke and Manish. When the service staff got to see my wedding anniversary bouquet from my bff, they handed me a nice holding vase to fill my flowers in order to allow me have the luxurious space to have my dinner.When we start having our buffet, they will make sure our table are cleared before when we head for another round. Their service is prompt and efficient. Lastly, quite thoughtful of them, by surprising us with an anniversary cake to end our day. Awwwww! Lovely! Will go back again, not only the service, the food was superb

I had the pleasure to enjoy my breakfast in Brasserie Les Saveurs during my stay in St. Regis Singapore.I have been served by an outstanding staff Mr. Kaushik who made my visit remarkable and comfy. Must try .. highly recommend everything delicious
5
The hotel's restaurant is outstanding. With the combination of overlooking pool and gardens is just so relaxing.. added by live music performance is just pretty amazing... The food were satisfying.This is definitely a place we will always come back to. I Highly recommend it!Many thanks to Irene and Christian Chavez for being attentive to our needs...
5
value for money sunday lunch buffet with good quality food and service was great. Irene took extra care of my twin toddlers by going out of her way to provide additional food that suit their needs. when she found out that it was my fatherâ€™s bday, she also gave us a complimentary cake for our celebration. overall a great experience. thanks specially to Irene
5
ambiance was great; pianist playing. food were good. excellent staffs accommodating to me & my wife's needs. especially our waiters Kuai & Irene. Got a birthday cake and complimentary parking as well. Very attention to details. Wonderful night. thank you
5
Absolutely attentive service I have gotten tonight from Gary and Jason Kuai! These boys are friendly, chatty and most importantly, professional! Making our yearly anniversary visit here always pleasant and memorable! Thank you St Regis and team! Highly recommend the semi buffet. Not too much yet satisfying. The beef was done perfectly.

My wife and had decided for a quiet weekday dinner without our kids and we were so glad we decided to visit Brasserie Les Saveurs!We took the semi-buffet and were pleasantly greeted with a wonderful spread of starters. My wife loved the pumpkin soup which was smooth and sweetened at the right degree. I was addicted to the duck rillettes. Our ordered mains of Hokkaido scallop and herb roasted rack of lamb were tastefully prepared as well. The dessert section is the actual highlight of our dinner. I regretted not born with a second stomach. Many of these sinful delights were beautifully decorated and they tasted as good as they looked! Our dinner ended with tea from TWG. I had the chamomile tea and it came with a small jar of honey. Will definitely return here again :
5
Was a bit shocked initially as my main course of Wagyu Beef Bourguignon came in (seemingly) small portion. The braised beef was very tender and super yummy! However, after polishing all the mashed potatoes that was served together, I was a very satisfied diner! And so, the portion was just right! I am not a salad eater so the dessert table is very important to me. I must say the dessert selections kept me happy throughout the night
4
Went there on December 22 as most other French restaurants were fully booked. I consider was very good value for money; wide selection of main courses, and the formula with both entrees and deserts buffet is perfect. Wine selection was good. Service impeccable. Apparently the Sunday brunch menu is going to change in 2018 so we are most likely going to pay another visit shortly on a Sunda
5
Went for the semi buffet lunch. Great ambience. Pleasant and attentive service, especially Jason who went the extra mile to ensure our dining experience was pleasant such as offering warm drink and shawl when he noticed I was feeling cold and checking on us every now and then to ensure the food is good
4
The restaurant has a great fine dining ambience with a live pianist performing and the Christmas decors made it even better! Maybe we were expecting too much even though it was a semi buffet, there were limited choices but what's available are pretty much appetizers and deserts. I had the pan seared seabass which was well cooked and of generous portion. Service provided by Christopher was excellent and he was very polite making our experience here very pleasant. He even recommended our 5 year old child tomato pasta which she loved.
5
I visited to celebrate my birthday. Upon entering we were recognised by Sage and were happily served by Alex. He wished me a birthday upon seeing me as well as being very attentive to my every need throughout the afternoon tea. The food was delicious and the place very regal and fit for a queen. Please visit for an unforgettable birthday celebration!
4
We had a great time having Christmas eve high tea at the hotel. Friendly and attentive service, especially Alex and Narash. The scones, cream n jam are our favorites. The ambience with live piano is wonderful.
3
We visited this wonderful restaurant with sublime setting twice before and really impressed by the great service and very good and upmarket selection of antipasti & salad ! On our visit in early Dec together with another couple to celebration my friend's birthday (expecting the same lofty standard that would smitten my guests) , we were shocked to find very limited selection of salad and hardly any antipasti ! Only one selection of soup and all our cups were left almost half full ! The main courses served were mediocre especial the Hokkaido scallops were tiny and half-cooked( the serving staff insisted it was meant to be?) and the turkey in two ways fared no better .The saving grace was the service standard still very cordial and the ambience still bears the hallmark of a super-luxe outlet .We were left with impression that why such a drastic change 
2
The atmosphere, the food and the music are considered nice, but when it comes to birthday celebration, it can be a disaster. Being a new supper club member, I was told there will be a small token i.e a glass of champagne and chocolate cake for bday celebration. End up I reminded the restaurant TWICE, and it took 45 mins to send a glass of champagne without any other surprises anymore, other that the long wait “surprises”. I actually quite empathized with the pianist who kept playing bday songs for different guests, hence I leave the restaurant without waiting for my turn (assumed since I don’t have any cake besides a glass of champagne).. the restaurant is not really full house on 9/12 evening, but still the service level is indeed very much under expectation, will feedback to Supper Club too
2
Limited choice for semi buffet.Did not refill condiments for saladOnly one kind of soup,and it was clearly not a favourable one..hardly saw anyone taking the chestnut soup.lolDessert was also limited ..not extensive at all..clearly disappointing to have celebrated my birthday at this restaurant.The host never came to our table to ask us how our dinner was.Service for a luxurious restaurant was certainly not up to our standard.Lastly,it was so cold..constantly felt aircon draft blowing!Was the 1st vist and will be the last to this restaurant
4
Went with my friends on my birthday last month, 13th Nov for the high tea session. I find the ambience and environment lovely, and the services provided by the staffs are excellent I would say
5
The food was great and the service by Jason and Angelie was awesome! Love the chandeliers too! Makes the environment super cosy
5
Nice breakfast service and exclusive service.Very helpful service person PaislyIs nice and efficient.Food are wonderful service is great
3
The buffet have very limited choice and selection. Appetizer (salads, sushi rolls, ham, soup, bread and cheese), Dessert (chocolate fondue, cheesecake, ice-cream, fruits). I have selected the Wagyu beef as main course. 50% off if paying with Amex platinum. Not worth it if paying with full price. Child below 4 or 5 eating for free, but nothing suitable for young children. Not recommended if you have young children with you. The ambience is very nice.
3
Semi buffet dinner includes very minimal and limited spread of appertizers which tastes very normal. Nothing special and doesnt have a good quality standard. Desserts on the otherhand have quite a fair spread of choices.Main course is ok
5
I was there for the Champagne Brunch with my family to celebrate my 41st birthday on 26th November 2017. And quite frankly, I was disappointed by the poor attentiveness of staffs at the entrance - greeted us but forgot to check our booking and hence delayed our seatings at our table. Further, my wife has informed the entrance staff discretely that it was my birthday and she would appreciate a 'surprise' birthday song from the live Jazz vocal whom was already present. However the entrance staff ended up coming to both my wife and I openly and informed that the birthday song will be played in few minutes...so no longer a surprise. However aside from these 2 rather 'surprising and unexpected' poor quality of service, all the rest was wonderful. I would like to highlight one specific staff, Ms. Irene Alejo, for her exceptional attentiveness, great smile, and such high professionalism and knowledge of what she does. Ms. Irene Alejo's high level of service simply made up all the initial discomforts my family has felt in the beginning. Salute to her

Was there last night to celebrate my birthday with my wife.Food, ambience and food service were excellent. However, when I ordered for a dessert wine to finish the dinner off nicely with my cheeses, I was told by the waiter politely that it had "ran out" and he asked if I may want to order another drink instead. Quite surprised for a 6 star establishment like St Regis. Anyways, I did not want to allow this to spoil my birthday dinner, so I ordered a Grappa instead. The wait was long and the waiter kept reassuring me that it was coming and that his colleague had to take it from "another branch". I watched the cheese melting in my plate and waited and waited and waited...Alas, the captain came with a glass & bottle and delivered the bad news, again, that the Grappa had also "ran out". He offered me an alternative of a Amaronino. Was not sure what was it and declined it at first. But captain was patient and asked if I wanted to try and I did. It went ok and I decided to go for it. Thanks to the captain's recommendation, I finally managed to finish off my birthday dinner nicely with the cheese that have been sitting in my plate for almost 30mins!I could not fault the service staff but seriously felt that the bar manager has let his colleagues down tremendously. Inventory that have "ran out" should at least have been informed to the restaurant service staff in advance to advice diners appropriately, so that diners are not given false hopes of what is being offered. And for a well respected establishment like St Regis to have "ran out" of both very common beverages like desert wine & grappa (boasting a fine Italian restaurant) concurrently, this really baffled me
5
Beautiful ambience, nice food and deserts, wide spread of tea selection. Staffs service are great, especially Christoper whom provided excellent service to us. Thank you, we have a great night here
5
Just want to say a big thank you to Jason Kuai and Angeline for the amazing hospitality! Food was good - striploin was tender and scallops were amazing. Started and ended of the meal with their semi-buffet, Super worth it. Service topped off everything! A big thank you to the team again for making my birthday an enjoyable one.
5
Celebrated my wife’s birthday with my son at Brasserie Les Saveurs this evening. A beautiful ambience with delicious food culminated by very personable and world class service by passionate and pleasant crew such as Christopher and Ms.Irene who helped us to a better seat and organised a surprise birthday cake for my Wife (immensely grateful!!) The pianist Mr.Amir’s lovely rendition made the ambience filled with loves and romance. We, especially my son (4 years old) was so inspired and captivated by Mr.Amir’s personal touch. What a superb evening! Thank you so much
5
My fiancée and I came to this restaurant to celebrate our 9th year anniversary.We were very pleased with the service of the staff especially jason and irene. They were very attentive and definitely made our night a very pleasant one.The food was great and value for money! We had the rack of lamb and striploin, coupled with a mini buffet of appetisers, soup and dessert.Highly recommended for couples who wants to enjoy a night of romantic dinner date

You can either select you breakfast off the counter or you can place an order from the comfort of your table, making your selections from the menu. Class ..
5
Went to this restaurant for the first time recently with my wife and we were extremely impressed with the ambience (with pianist playing soothing tunes) and good quality food. Jason Loke (waitperson) was super attentive, knowledgeable with the wines and other beverages on offer and basically he made it an amazing evening for us. Will certainly return soon
5
Good food, good service especially Irene. Really had a good time there. Food was good. Will coming back for sure!
3
Celebrated a birthday at BLS, and am appreciative of the personalized service rendered by Mr Jason Loke and Christopher in going the extra mile to make sure that we received timely attention. The evening was sweetened by a personal birthday tune and a small cake, which we took home considering the large portions for dinner.Thanks

We booked a table for a French Connoisseur Experience and the only French connection was the $200+ bottle of French Wine. The Semi Buffet French experience is what we were offered which included a Buffet Appetizer, A La Carte Main and a Buffet Dessert. The Appetizer was a selection of Salads(not very french), I selected the Rack of Lamb for the Al A Carte main and received 2 x Lamb Chops, 2 x Asparagus stems, another guest on the table ordered the seared prawns and received 4 x average prawns with a cold sauce. The Buffet dessert again was a selection of tarts, pannacotta and other non french desserts. For an evening that cost in excess of $600 for 4 people we were very disappointing. I think if you are going to advertise a French dinner than maybe you should offer some French style food at the very least.Not a very good experience for a prestigious hotel that prides themselves on luxury and eleganc

It was my second time this year dining at St. Regis. I had a great experience dining here with my partner for his birthday and recommended it for my colleague’s birthday celebration . We enjoyed the ambience, lovely buffet spread and tasty food. We are thankful for the impeccable service provided by Mabian and Kartie who served us well and went the extra mile to help us in getting condiments and helping us to look for spots to take photos. They were very friendly and it made our experience here enjoyable. Would definitely recommend here as It can be a nice, quiet and romantic spot for dining.

I just came home from dinner at Brasserie Les Saveurs at St. Regis in Singapore. We were supposed to celebrate the birthdays of 2 young ladies at this restaurant tonight. I am so upset and disappointed that I had to write this review tonight.We arrived promptly for dinner at Brassarie Les Saveurs at 8.30pm and I announced our reservation of 6 to the hostess at the reception of the restaurant after which we were promptly seated.I need to tell you that I had made the reservation for this restaurant, and gotten an email reply from St. Regis about my reservation 1 week ago. In my communication with St. Regis I had specifically stated that we were celebrating 2 birthdays and that I would like to have a birthday cake with both names on it presented at dinner...to which St. Regis confirmed that they would be able to cater to my request.Imagine the shock I had when after the dessert the waitress presented the bill to me. So I asked "What happened to the Birthday cake?" and she just gave me a blank stare!!! When she went away to find out I walked away from my table to speak to the manager in charge to explain what had happened...but he too had no idea.What was supposed to be a night of celebration and surprise had turned out for us to be a very disappointing, poor night. They finally came out with a cake which I believe was put together at the very last minute...and to make matters even worse they even managed to spell the name of the birthday girl wrongly.BIG BIG disappointment...not something I would expect from St. Regis

It’s our second visit to this restaurant for dinner, food was delicious and of good quality. We were served by Christopher on both occasions, his service was impeccable and very accommodating. Highly recommended for dinner and the afternoon tea as wel

It was our Anniversary Celebration and my wife had decided on this restaurant. She had shared that she liked the ambience there, i had never been there. The place was beautiful and it wasn't like other restaurants which were noisy and crowded. It was just nice and the ambience enhanced by the lights, decorations and the pianist who played very well. We enjoyed the music, the food and pampered by the staff there who noticed that we were dressed for the occasion and took the initiative to ask if we are celebrating. They gave us a cake as a surprise. Special Thanks to the Staff Irene for her attentiveness. we are coming back definitely.

I was thrilled that I celebrated my birthday here during their Caroline Astor afternoon tea. The food was lovely, with the dishes thoughtfully prepared. My top 3 favourite savouries are the Foie Gras Mousse with Pear Jelly In Shot Glass, Pressé of Duck Meat with Rhubarb Compote, and Mille-Feuille with Smoked Salmon and Dill Cream. For the desserts, everything was yummy, really! My daughter requested for a birthday dessert and what I got a whole mini chocolate cake! So lucky! But of course the best thing was the ambience and atmosphere that made our afternoon tea a relaxing and enjoyable one. The staff were friendly, helpful, and prompt in clearing the plates/ refilling water for the tea. I I recommend this place for those looking to have a lovely afternoon tea time.

Been staying at St Regis almost every time in SG, nice ambience for breakfast and offers good services! Waitress Sage offers good services and friendly!
5
Excellent Service with a nice classy atmosphere. The food especially the Hokkaido scollops are excellent and the steaks are the Best in Singapore. Service from Jason Luke and Irene was top class, making it a 6 Star Experience
5
Service was excellent! We commend Jason Kua, Manish and Doris for their fine services; they make us feel very relax and comfortable. We had oven roasted Norwegian Salmon, Seabass "En Matelote" and Tajima Beef Bourguignon. All three dishes were delicious and succulent!We were accorded the "alcove seating" which is absolutely romantic
5
Decided to dine at this restaurant during our staycation. We like the ceiling decor, which was simply beautiful. A pianist plays familiar tunes of movie songs during our dinner, and it adds a different ambience to the dining experience. We ordered a 'set dinner' and an ala carte dish, and I'm pleasantly surprised that we were allowed to share some of the food items at the buffet line with no extra charge. There are quite a lot of food variety at the buffet line, and we managed to try most of it. We ordered the oysters (fresh & juicy) for starter, the cod & striploin for mains, and it was all yum yum. Would love to dine here again soon :
5
excellent food esp the stew beef, plus excellent service in a very nice comfortable setting. Been there many times. Without fail Ms Doris Yang is always friendly, knowledgeable with a ready smile. Mr Manesh is also outstanding. The price is very affortable. Highly highly recommend be working lunch or a quiet dinne
5
I canâ€™t explain enough how great this place was - breakfast, lunch or dinner the food was incredibly tasty with great variety. The service is also impeccable, especially from Sage who was so wonderful in recommending things for us to do during our stay. Would return here time and time again.
5
Beautiful ambience, delicious food (we had the beef & chicken for mains), a scrumptious & varied spread (of salads, fruits, desserts) & superb service (especially from Doris & Manish). And at great value, too
4
Was disappointed seeing the place - tht the furniture could be spruced up a little and hmmm.... very practical, tables had no table cloth except place mats. Spread wasn't wow wow but the experience was saved by the really friendly and good service. Service staff, Angelie was amazing! The Vietnamese staff at the waffle n crepe station was sweet and accommodated my requests! NICE.
2
Eaten breakfast the past three days in this restaurant in the St Regis.The service team really work hard and are extremely polite, but they do make mistakes, and when the mistakes are pointed out to the floor managers they are not well received...The problem is the food, the management of the hotel is trying to please all ethnicities, and consequently end up providing second rate quality of food. Food warmers do not work...Please provide 80% less choice, and improve the quality of your offering
5
Wonderful food and settings. We had the Atlantic Cod and lamb - both were done with great culinary skills and great finishes. Fantastic service by Paisly and her crew who were professional and attentive. It was an important day for me, and her team had definitely exceeded my expectations in making sure everything went smoothly.Thank you for the excellent dining experience! I will definitely visit this restaurant again
5
Food was of excellent quality, limited variety but quality trumps quantity. We were served by Jason Kuai - friendly, professional, anticipated our needs and made us feel very well taken care of
5
This is the main dining room at the St Regis hotel. It serves buffet style food in a very elegant setting. We enjoyed our breakfasts here. The staff are polite and friendly
5
Very nice ambience and the food is wonderful. I had the Atlantic Code and it is really one of the best I tasted. Service level was really attentive especially Daisy. Thank you for a nice evening
5
My husband made reservations for 7pm dinner, we were at door 6:45pm and the lady staff at the reception was on the line for a good 2mins before telling us that dinner only starts at 7 and turned us away!!!! I'm surprised this happened at a reputable hotel's restaurant. I'm sure we could be shown in at least for that 15mins wait??!! We were just earlier to beat the peak hour traffic.I'm glad our server Manish's excellent service eventually made our dinning experience pleasant with his patience and dedicated service. The food were great and thank you for the mini birthday cake we all enjoyed
5
Spent the past 2 months breakfast there. Simple options good for business trips.However the stars here are all the people working in restaurant, starting from Sage and Cindy from the front desk area to welcome us warmly every morning, to the servers who remember your daily breakfast coffee and fruit preference. Really make me feel like home.Good job Sage Cindy and the whole team!
5
Recently dined here during one of our visits to Singapore. We celebrated a birthday whilst having breakfast and Sage was very on top of all our needs. She served us fantastically with great attention to all the tiny details. The service we received was exceptional! Thank you so much for all your help
5
With thirty-feet high floor to ceiling windows this restaurant is built to impress. Pity the aircon is absolutely freezing - and we weren’t the only ones complaining. The view is also wanting as you see the next door building which looks abandoned as it’s empty. But food especially the desserts is yummy. The set lunch is very good value and I would recommend it hands down.

We had high tea as a family on a Friday and were pleasantly surprised with the variety of food available. The foie gras mousse, cheese table and Alaskan king crab salad were highlights for me personally. However, what differentiated our experience at this restaurant was the impeccable service we received from Christopher. He was very attentive and warm throughout our meal. Having had a very bad experience at Antidote just two weeks ago, it was a very refreshing change and heartening to know that good service does still exist in Singapore
5
The staff were all very polite and efficient. The food was served promptly. The ambience was gorgeous, and the live pianist was the cherry on top of the cake
5
My wife and I enjoyed our wedding anniversary dinner at this nice and cozy restaurant. The ambience was quiet with delightful piano music in the background while we enjoyed our dinner. The mini buffet has quite a spread and just enough variety to let you eat enough while still leaving room for the main course and dessert. My wife enjoyed her cod fish main course and my beef steak was also juicy and delicious. The waiter who served us, Jason Loke was polite and amicable. The restaurant also arranged for a complimentary cake for us when I indicated in my online reservation that I was celebrating my wedding anniversary. What a nice gesture
2
The restaurant was clearly under staffed. the section of food from the buffet was extremely limited and most plates were almost empty. The cheese, remember this is supposed to be a French restaurant, were non descript and when I enquired what they where, was told" that one is goat", thank you for that. I asked for the wine list and was given a card that consisted of a handful of French white and red wines, grossly over priced. When I asked for an extra glass of wine at the end of the meal it took for ever to arrive. I enquired about the delay and was told the wine waiter had left already.Over priced and poor to mediocre food selection
4
A gorgeous setting for afternoon tea. The spread is huge ! Prefer the savoury items to the cakes and desserts- which is not usually the case for me . Creme caramel was disappointing and watery.Loved the selection of cheese. Overall a good spread with quite a bit to choose from
3
Love the pianist, the high beautifully sculpted ceiling and the overall ambience of the place. However, for a place that has high end pricing, I would expect the service staff to be friendlier. We were served by a waiter who barely smiled and who somehow gave unfriendly vibes. The couple beside us waited 1.5 hour for their entrees and only got served when they threatened to walk out. The food was decent, but not something to rave about.
4
The semi-buffet set dinner was good.They had a wide range of dessert selection. We had a very good experience with the staff, name "Jason Kuai". The service was excellent in my opinion, he spoke good English and was attentive all the time. The night ended well and pleasant
5
It's my second time celebrating my birthday at Brasserie Les Saveurs and I have to say that I'm still blown away by the decor, ambience, service and fantastic spread made available for the diners. The last time we were here was in 2015 and I'm glad to see that the service has not dipped one bit. Paisly – the lady who entertained our requests to take photos – was very attentive, along with the other servers that checked in periodically with us to ensure that all was good. A complimentary birthday cake was served with a lovely piano rendition of the birthday song. My boyfriend had the lamb whilst I had the striploin and we were both very happy with the food served. Would absolutely recommend this place for a lovely night for anyone who wants to spend their time in a great diner. Will definitely be back again in the future
5
This is our regular go to place for dinner. Menu just changed this month. The Angus striploin is done just right. Love the dessert buffet. Excellent service staff, especially Daisy
5
Enjoyed a lovely evening dining here today. Delicious food selections, cosy inviting ambience, and most importantly, great service from the staff here. Special mention to Jason Loke who attended to us and made this an exceptional experience this evening.

This was my second time to Brasserie Les Saveurs. Was there to celebrate my wife's birthday. The place was quite grand with high ceilings. The thing that impressed me the most is their service. The crews were attentive, nice and also well trained, especially the gentleman that was serving us (apologies as forgotten his name). They even surprised my wife with a birthday cake. A big thank you to Mr Kartie and his crew (as well as the pianist) for making it a wonderful evening for us.As for the food, they have a very good spread of deserts and appetizers. The main course (streak and fish) that we are having was nice. A bit of suggestion. Maybe you may want to replace some of the chocolate deserts with other type of deserts. The reason being the desert corner is overflowing with chocolate stuff
2
We went to Brasserie Les Saveurs for the JJ epicurean lunch experience and the only reason we went there was because my partner had won a dining voucher at her company's dinner and dance and it was valid until September. From here on out, it was just a lack of communication between the staff to us as well as the staff's internal communication which sparked our ire.We were already unimpressed with the way the voucher redemption was handled. We were bounced around with no answer for almost 2 weeks, but that's beside the point. As this is a restaurant review, I shall stick to that. It is just a bit of a backstory to substantiate that this was just the tip of the iceberg to show that communication between the staff was just nonexistent!As I was saying, we were already annoyed by the communication we had with the hotel staff but was able to get a table. We were making our way down to the when we got caught in traffic. Fearing we might be late, my partner gave a call to the restaurant to inform them that we might be late and to expect us at 1pm. The staff who answered our call told us not to worry and that it was not a problem. However, 5 - 10 minutes later, my partner received a call from the restaurant to ask if we were still coming and she had to explain that she had already called ahead to inform.When we got there the maitre d' lead us to our seat and gave us our menus. My partner informed her that we had a dining voucher and we were told that she was aware of it and the amount would deducted when we called for the bill. She then told us she'd be back with a kid's menu for our boy. It never came. We had to ask another staff for a menu for him. Not a great start.As the epicurean lunch was a semi-buffet, we could help ourselves to the buffet spread. I took a bowl of the pumpkin soup and regretted it. The pumpkin soup was exceptionally sweet! Pumpkin soup has been getting increasingly popular here in Singapore, so I'm sure we have had our fair share. At least enough to know how it should taste. And yes, pumpkin soup is usually sweet, but this one tasted more like a sweet dessert. Sugar had definitely been added to it and the chef had been heavy handed in adding it. When I spoke to a waiter, he said he would bring it up to the chef but was unapologetic about it. Not that we needed an apology, but if people pay good money to dine here, shouldn't a restaurant be a bit more apologetic to hear that the diner was not enjoying their dining experience? It isn't the waiter's fault but a simple, "Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. I will bring it up to the chef." would suffice. When people are dining at a restaurant in a 5-star hotel, there's a certain expectation on the service and the service recovery.So there's also a small, what we assume to be a Japanese section as there were a small assortment of sushi and such. My partner took a bowl of the soba noodles and the sauce was overly salty. My partner is Japanese, so she knows how soba should taste. This time, we couldn't be bothered to bring it up. With that being said, we found that the bread and salad were quite palatable.Service, however was slow and inattentive. By this time, we all had something to nibble on from the buffet whilst awaiting our mains so the plates on our table were starting to stack up. It was so full in fact, that if we had gone for another round of food, there'd be no space left for the new plates. We had to signal the waiter to help clear the plates. In fact, throughout our lunch, we had to signal the waiters to clear the plates 3-4 more times! On one occasion, a gentleman whom we assume is a manager due to his jacket walked past and my partner asked if he could clear the plates. He replied, "Certainly." and walked off. I assume to get someone else to clear the plates. So that meant we had to wait another few minutes while someone came to clear the plates, so that we could get more food. Isn't the structure too rigid? Can't a manager clear some plates? I know it must be a restaurant staff as he was walking in and around the restaurant.When we made the reservation, we had told the staff that we were there to celebrate a birthday so towards the end of the meal, we got a complimentary birthday cake, which was a nice touch. However, just a few minutes after we got the first birthday cake, we got another one and the waiter who could see that there was already a cake on the table, had to very awkwardly, offer to pack the cake. Obviously, there had been some miscommunication between the staff. I suppose it isn't a complaint per se. Who'd complain about having an extra cake? But my point is the lack of communication between staff members.Lastly, we come to the bill. When we called for the bill, we were shocked to see the amount and quickly realised that they had not taken in the values of the voucher and had charged us full price. So even when we had reiterated at the start that we had a dining voucher and was assured that the amount would be deducted at the bill, it was not done. I suppose at this point, it would suffice to say we were no longer surprised by their lack of communication.It is all the more disappointing because we used to love dining at St Regis. Especially my partner who has brought many of her Japanese guests for luncheon and high tea at Brasserie Les Saveurs. But of late, we have found that the service and quality of the food to be in decline. In fact, if not for the vouchers, we would not have dined here. The service we had over the weekend has been really disappointing and only confirms our theory. We doubt very much that we would be returning. The service provided for the day was way below what we'd expect from a restaurant at a 5-star luxury hotel.My take on Brasserie Les Saveurs? It's not a horrid place. The staff on the whole are courteous and polite. It is however, a tad over priced for the quality of the food and the service rendered. If you want to impress your special someone with the St Regis brand name, go for it. But don't expect 5-star treatment
2
The service staff was the only good thing about the high tea. The Alaskan king crab salad (which was tasty) was served in two teaspoons worth of portion - probably not the most generous, given the $49 buffet price tag. The biggest disappointment was the main reason I wanted to have high tea - three-tiers of pastries, scones and small bites. The pastries were too sweet, the scones probably would have tasted better warm and the small bites could have been filled a little more. The buffet spread was not promptly refilled and choices were allowed to run out. Disappointing experience.

I had my niece staying from the UK, and she really wanted to do afternoon tea. My first choice was St Regis, as I have been a few times for afternoon tea, and it was wonderful. I booked in advance and was assured that they could provide a gluten free experience for my niece. My tea came out as expected on the beautiful 3 tiered serving platter, hers was carried on a plate. There was sandwiches, a couple of pieces of fruit in a glass and what looked like a Creme caramel. No cake, no pastries! She did get a vegetable soup. No one explained what was gluten free on the buffet, luckily they had a chocolate fountain. Such a disappointment. I had thought a top hotel with trained chiefs could make gluten free cake or pastry, obviously not. I have to say my tea was superb, excellent pastries and scones. They did give he discount when I said how disappointed I was, but that wasn't the point, it was the experience l wanted to give
5
The ambience of this place is perfect as usual. Pair that with the most excellent staff and you'll get an amazing night. I celebrated my actual birthday by coming for dinner in this place. It did not disappoint! The staff were really attentive and courteous. I would like to specially mention Irene, Manish, Angeline, Christianne and Ahmad. All of them were really great. They engaged with us and made us feel comfortable. They were patient when we took too long deciding on everything. Haha!The Mr. playing the piano was magical (still and always!) and they sang a birthday song for me with a cake. Sweet of them. Thank you!There was just one odd event on this night (none that concerned us but I would like to point out). There was one guest who was not dressed appropriately for the restaurant, came by and looked at buffet for a very brief period. He did not wait too long (probably less than 2 mins) then he came inside the restaurant and went out again. I noticed later that he gathered all the staff and complained about "discrimination" (his voice was loud enough for us to overhear) which I felt was just weird since he came in contact with nobody and he was barely even there. Anyway, my night was just perfect and thank you to all the friendly faces. :) Be back again for high tea maybe. :
5
Celebrating my gf's birthday dinner at Brasseie Les Saveurs was a great decision as the live piano performance and the ambiance of the place made for a romantic dinner setting. Special thanks to Jessa for being able to bring over the birthday cake along with the birthday song by the pianist. Would definitely come back again. Great food, service and ambiance
4
This is my second visit of Brasserie Les Saveurs.The services, ambience, taste of both tea and meals are all excellent as same as previous time.Expecially, my wife were happy to ellegant ambience that could not be experienced in japan.We wish to visit with my families this restaurant again
5
Grand chic decor, great ambiance - we loved the light show outdoor fountain feature - live piano played in background. The dinner experience good value with the lavish spread of starters that cover everything one might wish for. Nice tasty food. And scrumptious dessert buffet. Wine list extensive but pricey. Thank you for the staff (Jessa, Ahmad, Irene, Alvin, Christopher and Christian) to make our special day memorable
5
Just love the ambience here. Not crowded, personalized service. Good choice of salad and dressing. Tuna and salmon rolls are tasty. Just stay away from the udon cold noodles. tasteless. Just love the beef brisket. Dessert is just delish
2
Going there for birthday, we felt so rush by the staff : we are placed at one table and immediately they open the big menu in front of each of us, not even asking if we have drink first...All the rest of the diner will be the same, not even able to discuss with my friend as the server simply come and interrupt you to ask if everything is ok or asking if we want to select the next plate ! Even worst, i did not finish my 'entré', still in the plate some food, and I'm trying to discuss with my friend while a server come and take my plate... Another very bad point is that at our arrival we have been said that 2 plates was not in the menu, which is in definite very fine as they immediately told us. Then we ordered and we are said that what we ordered is not available ( Foie gras ). A bit disappointed that a 3rd plate is not available we change our command again and eat our entrées. Then the main is suppose to arrive : "sir what you ordered is not available"... 4 dishes not available ! I start to get annoyed and ask how many dishes on the menu are available speaking about the 'entré' problem at first, etc... finally she replied that the foie gras was available and it is a mistake !!!On the bright side, the quality of what they serve is good and the scenery not bad either. Nevertheless i would not recommend this restaurant at all, this is completely over price ( 500 for 2 with 1 bottle of champagne, 2 entrés, 2 mains) for the bad service and the choice in the menu!In short :Service : 0/10Food : 7/10Scenery : 5/10Price : 1/1
3
I visited the restaurant twice this month because I wanted to make use of the 50% discount for American Express cardholders - I didn't realize the offer did not apply to the afternoon tea so I came back a second time for lunch. The food was utterly disappointing especially the afternoon tea which ironically I paid full price for. For both occasions, I fell back onto the cheese selections. Absolutely not worth the price charged for and note that the wine by the glass is out of price
5
We had a la carte dinner at Brasserie Les Saveurs, sitting at a table for two facing the pool and fountain. Even with two children running and playing between the tables, the atmosphere was romantic with the dark lighting, piano music, and the blue and red lights playing on the fountain outside. The sourdough bread and butter are tasty, and the free wi-fi signal was strong. We were happy to see that they had a sweet late harvest Chilean sauvignon blanc by the glass. Both the oven roasted duck breast with orange sauce with mashed potatoes and caramel salt sundae with toffee popcorn were excellent. We had potato wedges with truffle, and I could not taste the truffle in the few wedges that I ate, but my wife could taste the truffle in hers. The staff were faultlessly professional and friendly, making us feel welcomed and well cared for. As we were leaving after a pleasant dinner, we realized how cold it was in the vault-like restaurant. Next time we will bring a sweater or shawl. The price after the Starwood discount was reasonable. We recommend Brasserie Les Saveurs as an excellent special occasion dinner restaurant
4
We went there for the Epicurean lunch set menu which came with a main and semi-buffet. For mains, we chose the beef and salmon. Both mains were very good especially the beef which was very tender and the portion was not too big. The variety and quality of food in the semi-buffet were good with plenty of salads, breads, soup, hams, cheese, smoked fish and sushi. There were ample desserts to finish the meal with coffee or tea. A very satisfying lunch with good service and beautiful ambience. We used the Amex platinum card and got 50% off
5
Right from the start the staff were all very attentive and friendly. Food was great and in particular, I was pleased to see that there has been variation in the cooking style since my last visit
5
Dinner buffet is nice. Good varieties. Good choice of salad vegetables and salad dressing. Tuna and salmon sashimi are good although a bit dried up. The main course cod fish is good. Decoration are nice and comfortable. Good standard. Live pianist is a plus and makes atmosphere relaxing and romantic. Servers provide above average services. Eager to please and service with a smile. Nice restaurant.
5
I loved this place! The ambiance is gorgeous, there is a person playing piano and no rush for you to leave the restaurant. The staff is very gentle.I chose to eat the buffet ($75) they have and for me was the best choice, as you can have apettizers and as many dessert as you want, in this buffet you also can chose your main, and I went for the beef, I may say it was one of the best in my life.The price of the meals and buffet is ok, although the bottle of wine is a bit expensive ($120)
5
The service from the waiters have been great from the counter to my table, The variety of their wine selection is also very suitable for the food pairing during my dinner
5
Just went yesterday with a couple of friends at this afternoon tea haven.. Love the semi-buffet spread(they even have prosciutto, salami and cheeses too!) in addition to the 3-tiered stand served at our table. The selection of scones with clotted cream & lemon curd are must-haves, my favourites are the classic and orange ones! Friendly service staffs that checks on you every now and then. Perfect ambience with friends to relax and catch up, will definitely go again
5
Ambience was spot on with wonderful live piano performance. Food was great, love the lamb rack and my wife loved the cod fish. Special mention to Ahmad, an exemplary example of excellent service, and making fine dining that much more special
5
This is my third times dining with friends at Brasserie Les Saveurs. Besides the elegance ambient, the food at buffet spread has been improving a lot better. Really feels like royalty dining with classic -cozy European theme. The service is superb, with friendly staffs and really helpful. Special thanks for Josephine & her team for looking after our table and made our weekend lunch wonderful. Will definitely recommend this restaurant in future
5
We celebrated our son birthday at the restaurant. The food is good, service is excellent and overall experience is awesome. Special thanks to Jessa and Taj
5
Excellent service and environment. Food is good quality and price is reasonable.Highly recommended

Went for lunch service at Les Saveur. It was a neat little place, quiet for lunch, which made for quiet enough to have a good conversation. The place smacks of class and elegance, and the grand piano only added to the ambience. It was an interesting service - buffet was primarily desserts stuff /salad/japanese sushi, while you have the order the main course off the menu. But what a dessert spread - I rate the dessert spread as one of the best I've had around, with a chocolate fountain as well. I went for the seabass as main course, but found it to be slightly overcooked, hard, and hardly special. I found the salmon far better. But otherwise, the desserts were heavenly. Service was one of the highlights of the place - staff were attentive and makes one feel at home - they don't linger too close for comfort, but are also never too far away when you need something (unlike some other places i've been) One of the staff (I believe her name is Doris) was particularly pleasant and helpful, and also extremely good for recommending what was good to try first on the dessert spread. It also does a lot for a place when the service staffs are cheerful and practice service with a smile, and Doris was very much so, which made me and my date feel very much at home and comfortable. (if anyone sees this please do send along my regards and thanks)The alcoves looked rather interesting to dine in, and I will probably give it a try on my next visit - they are semi- private dining places that apparently require one to book ahead, due to their popularity.Overall, a place i would come back to
5
We enjoyed Sunday tea at Brasserie Les Saveurs. The service was excellent, friendly and efficient. The food was delicious, offering a variety of authentic delights
5
When I first visited the restaurant, I left with a great time and a good memories of the service by the staff and the food. And yes I came back! This time for lunch and guess what? Josephine remembers me! What makes it different to places I go is that it makes u feel like visiting a friend place. Thanks Josephine for taking care of us yet again. I feel so important. This time I give 6 stars*

With my mum visiting me from overseas, I wanted to take her to somewhere special and impress. I searched, Googled, read reviews, and asked friends to find the perfect afternoon tea in Singapore. Sadly, we left feeling underwhelmed. The only word I can use to describe the food is 'dry' - particularly the savoury section. The sushi, mini pies, curry puffs were semi-cold (little lights are not going to keep them warm enough) and extremely dry - I could get better from a hawker centre! The best thing there was the cheesecake and the rest of the desserts were again, dry and disappointing. The sandwiches that came on the 2-tiers were not generous at all with a small smear of egg and a small piece of salmon.On the plus side, the service is excellent, the pianist is wonderful and the high ceilings and dÃ©cor are grand so if you just want atmosphere for $70 pp, go for it. However, a hotel as reputable as St Regis should be able to tick all of the boxes and make the food selection just as outstanding and memorable as the ambience. There are too many other good places in Singapore for afternoon tea and they need to up their game. This is actually the first review I have ever written on TripAdvisor and felt compelled to do so given how disappointed we were. Sorry St Regis
4
Great atmosphere, tasty food and beverage choices. Super spicy cocktails to start. Great service from Melvin.
5
We attended the lunch buffet in July and were absolutely blown away with both the food and the service. It was for my dad's birthday and he was given the Royal treatment with the jazz band and staff. We will never forget this experience and will recommend it to anyone we talk to.Go there tomorrow. You will not be disappointed
4
The beef cheeks were faultless in taste and execution, and the selection at the semi-buffet spread, albeit small, was competently done. The place was, generally, a little too dim but that aside, it was a pleasurable experience that warrants a second visit.
5
My friend and I were served by Jason. He provided excellent service and we felt very pampered the whole evening as he looked into our needs. The main course was well cooked and the tenderloin was delicious! Good spread of starters and desserts.
5
Took my 10 year old daughter here for High Tea as a treat. Oh my gosh, amazing service, delicious food, exquisite dinning room and live piano music. Cakes, pastries, sandwiches, crepes all amazing.Lovely view of the pool. Staff were very attentive, the best service in Singapore without doubt
4
Very nice ambience at Brasserie Les Saveurs @ St Regis. Nice selection of food. The service from the staff was great
4
I and my husband was very looking forward to enjoying afternoon tea there.the food was very nice and I didn't expect there was buffet which was many selections of cakes and scones and some of savory foods including Japanese sushi roll.We really enjoyed spending a nice time there with nice atmosphere. Just one thing it was very pity that we could not change to a different kind of tea. They just poured hot water into already very weak tea leaf. I asked a staff to change a tea, however, she told that we could not choose a different kind tea leaf.some cakes and scones were left. We wanted to taste such nice sweets with a strong and flavoured tea.Anyway we would love to be there again!Thank you so much
5
Great food, ambience and service!Remember to bring your Amex or standard chartered cards for the discounts
4
Semi buffet- spread could be wider! And main dish , more choices. Discount made more available esp from American Express
4
Loved the semi buffet; main dish was ok. Overall, nice setting. Probably not too interesting for kids
5
Excellent service by our server, Irene. Went out of her way to make sure that our food is served in the best way to whet our appetite

Relaxing ambiance with great food. Friendly and warm service from Manish and Sommelier Viknes portrayed excellent service when it comes to recommending food and wine. Really enjoyed my time and will definitely recommend

Our usual hang out place once a year 😍 then, we our discovery 👀👀👀 the Penang Char Kway Teow is so yummies by Chef Feng 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
We will be back soon 😋

Visited the hotel for breakfast buffet. And one of the chef Lai Yong Jia makes my experience with St Regis a good one. He pop by our table to greet us and share with us what is there on the buffet table. Definitely good service that we received
5
A touch tardy for the review but better late then never. Western selections were as you would find in any hotels around the world but top points for the Asian selection. Absoutely adored the Nasi Lemak and the Sambal Eggs as well as the 2 curries. Ordered the Japanese breakfast set and it tasted great. Kudos to Ian and Lily on the egg station for the exemplary omelettes and service as well as the service staff for the prompt running of the breakfast service. Would definitely return

A great way to start the week with a lovely meal at Brasserie Les Saveurs. We particularly enjoyed the wine-infused wagyu beef & of course the dessert buffet selection as part of the semi-buffet meal. My kids were well taken care of by Irene & Manesh, always checking in on them and whether they needed anything. The place has become more child-friendly since our last visit, with a kids dinner menu & crayons for colouring as well. Something to keep the kids occupied while the adults can relax listening to the live pianist performance. Already looking forward to our next meal there

I can say the service in St. Regis hotel is one of the best in Singapore. However, without the improvements on food, this restaurant will have to hold on for a long time to step up to next level. Compared to Ritz Carlton hotel, service is way far better but food is way too below average. Wish you can make some BIG change on your average semi buffet and main meals. Still, big thanks for the excellent service
5
Visited the restaurant for the afternoon high tea this week. The staff were understanding with our request for quieter seats since we have an active toddler with us, and helped us to a more private seating area. We were satisfied with the food variety, especially with the crepes and waffle station, as well as the variety of scones. Most importantly, the service staff were very friendly and patient with our toddler, and made an effort to ensure we were comfortable by regularly coming to check on us. Special round of thanks to service staff Angelie, Manish, and Kartie for the wonderful service
5
The char Kway Teow made by chef Feng was amazing. The crispy chicken wings and beef burgher are also strong recommendations from the family. The atmosphere is relaxed and the staff are all very attentive and friendly. They also serve the most amazing cookies with tea or coffee.

Was there for my wedding anniversary. We were given window seats where we could take in most of the beautiful lights while we dined, and also a complimentary cake. Staff is well trained and prompt in their service. Buffet menu was a little limited and the main dishes (part of buffet) were unfortunately not too memorable
3
Enjoyed the excellent attentive thoughtful service and nice quiet ambience on a weekday night. The buffet appetizers and desserts were average for a high end hotel. I expected better.The mains were decent
5
Visited Les Saveurs for a quick dinner before heading home. The food is amazingly good!!! My favorite would be the desserts buffet. Can't stop munching on those!!! Had my wine paired with cheese too, thank you Jessa for the help! Very kind of you. Hands down to the whole team for being warm and accommodating! I'll be back very soon

There are surefire ingredients to a perfect celebration meal - attentive service, endearing live music, sumptuous food and beautiful decor. We returned to such winning ingredients at Brasserie Les Saveurs to celebrate my wife's birthday. The quality of the semi-buffet was as good as it came. The ambience was quiet and relaxing. But the real treat came in the person who had served us - Jason. A winsome smile accompanied his warm demeanor throughout our meal. Jason was clearly committed to ensuring our evening was memorable. He was helpful in his knowledgeable guide of the menu; always at hand to meet our needs. This fine young man from Shanghai was a complete package of sincere hospitality. The evening was made magical with the alluring music of Romano the pianist. One after another, his fingers produced soothing sounds that comprised jazz, pop, classical and even Mandarin pop.When we left, it was with a deep satiety that was only possible with such a charming restaurant.The enchantment is already calling us back.

I had a wonderful dinner last night at the Brasserie Les Saveurs. We had the St. Regis Connoisseur Dinner. I ordered the Pan-seared Black Cod , it was skilfully done, just lightly crisp on the outside yet succulent and juicy. My husband had the Roasted Black Angus Prime Rib, he said it was perfect. The appetizer and dessert buffet was good match for the great main course. There was live music played in the background. Service was great and it was such a nice gesture for Chef Gordon to come around and chat. Thank you for an enjoyable dinner

Enjoyed our lunch experience immensely thanks to the attentive and helpful service by Angelie and staff. Keep it up :)
4
Service has improved a lot since my wife's prior visit. The staff was attentive and quite prompt this visit, and was very helpful in helping us move to another table, away from the corner we had been seated initially.Food wise, we decided against the buffet and went with the a la carte menu. We made the right choice with overall food quality very good.The lobster bisque was flavourful and one of the better ones we have had. The tomato consommé was light and refreshing. My steak was done exactly as requested (medium to medium rare) and was juicy & tasty. Kudos to Chef Gordon and his team
4
Had a great time here, the service by Taj was exceptional, loved his passion and expertise when recommending the best teas. He also gave us such personalised attention, he offered to heat up our scones and he noticed when we hadn't eaten crepes yet and served it up for us when it was supposed to be self serve; he made today's high tea such a memorable experience. Thank you Taj!The food itself was of a normal standard, not exceptional but there was lots to choose from, buffet style.
5
I was standing at the front of the restaurant asking for a table of 3 when I was told that it may not be possible since I didn't make any reservation and half of the room was reserved for a private function. My 7 year old son heard that and was so disappointed as he especially came for the Chocolate Fondue!Christianne, an awesome lady (server at the restaurant ) upon seeing that, looked into the table settings and creatively worked out the arrangement of the tables such that she was able to accommodate us while fulfilling all the reservations commitment. She is a true exemplary of someone delivering Outstanding Customer Service who cares and have gone above and beyond her call of duty. Well done and truly appreciate what you have done and your actions has definitely made my son's day a great one!!From: A truly satisfied and happy customer

I have been visiting with my family member on the middle of jun and having a great dinner on here serving the fresh seafood and delicious food, thanks to Ms.Josephine for the great service
5
The service was impeccable with a friendly server named Irene providing us with information on what to order, serving our food and clearing empty plates promptly. Food wise, we were greeted with a wide assortment of desserts and appetizers. The main course (salmon and sea bass was cooked and srasomed perfectly.I was celebrating my friends birthday and received a complimentary cake as well
5
Brassarie has an awesome dining atmosphere, beautiful chandeliers and nice settings. Service is superb, and the food is good. There is a chinese lady in black suit should be manager, she even advise me to sign up for starwood guest to get the discount. Thanks to her, we get 15% off for dinner and she is there whenever we need help. Wait staff was very efficient and thoughtful too, but we missed thier name. Both working on 20/6 dinner, thank you
5
They have done a great job at delivering their service and food to our table. I was extremely surprise at their service with such heartwarming delivery that me and my wife enjoyed thoroughly. Complement to Josephine and Angeline.
5
Came to brasserie and as usual get the warm smile and active staff. I got hands down with the overall service.Truly enjoy it like we always do. Don't say I did not intro!
5
Dining experience at Les Saveurs has always been pleasant .I like the Appetizer spread and soup ,especially the cheese station .cCod fish is my favorite for main course. The soup was piping hot when I had dinner here 2 weeks ago after giving them the feedback that it was not hot enough at the previous visit .Live music by the pianist is soothing. The Assistant Manager, Ms Josephine Ang is friendly and thoughtful .My guests enjoy themselves at Les Saveurs.
5
Restaurant attendants were alert of the services arranged beforehand i.e complimentary birthday cake for my boyfriend. Service was top-notch and the Wagyu Ribeye was just fantastic that the taste is still lingering. Kudos to the attendants namely Jason, Paisley and Irene who offered excellent services assistance whenever needed

The Brasserie Les Saveurs was established along with The St. Regis Singapore hotel in December 2007, and is their all-day dining and semi-buffet concept. With a focus on refined French cuisine admist an opulent setting, Brasserie Les Saveurs has long been a bastion of contemporary French fine dining in Singapore. We visited for a belated birthday celebration.Ambience at Brasserie Les Saveurs evokes a sense of classy extravagance. The small but opulent dining area impresses with its high ceiling, inimate mood lighting, floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the tropical gardens and sparkling pool, 3 enormous glittering hand-cut crystal chandeliers, and beautifully patterned floral motifs. Furnishing is comfortable, allowing for lingering meals, and there are even quiet curtained booths for more privacy. At night, a pianist regales guests with classical tunes.Service at Brasserie Les Saveurs befits its fine dining status, with staff being professional, courteous, and efficient. They accord personalised attention to guests, often coming around to check on your meal, or clear away empty / dirty plates. They display decent product knowledge, able to offer recommendations on the menu, and describe some components of dishes. They were able to assist in wine pairings for us, and are generally polite and refined. Very good impression.Food at Brasserie Les Saveurs is focused on French cuisine, fine dining style. Each dish we tried is well executed to a good standard, and tasty. Main courses are paired with a semi-buffet concept, making it well worth the price. Portions are decently sized, though with a semi-buffet, this is a moot point. Prices are higher than usual, naturally, but remain very good value for money, especially since the quality of food is good. Budget about SGD $87 per person for a meal, and up to SGD $137 per person with drinks included
5
Nice quiet place for a romantic night out with your significant other. The live music and service quality makes this a place to remember
5
Had our Anniversary dinner over here. Restaurant atmosphere was excellent, request for a quiet corner and we were arranged in a semi-private room with curtain.Semi buffet spread was great with a number of choice, my main was excellent (Angus Prime Rib)doness and cut was prefect, however my wife main was slightly overcooked (Scallop and Prawns).Overall service was excellent, server were attentive.Specially will like to thanks the staff by the name Irene, she made us feel welcome even before our visit and being attentive to all our needs and have it all arranged
5
Like the way they arrange for the anniversary dinner. Semi buffet spread is reasonable and nice. main course is average. Deco and atmosphere is great and fitting to the hote
5
Had a wonderful birthday dinner at Brasserie Les Saveurs. As expected, service was polished, the atmosphere was fantastic, and the food was top notch. And not to mention, the live piano was great
4
The staff here are very friendly and helpful. They would not hesitate to give you suggestions and assistance when needed. We had the Salmon and Duck Confit main courses. Whilst the Salmon tasted good, it could definitely go with a more flavorful sauce to complement it as the parsnip tasted a bit bland. The Duck Confit was a little dry when it should be tender and moist since I assumed it had been slow-cooked for a long time. The buffet station was great, spoilt for choices. They even gave us a petit birthday cake to celebrate since it was my girlfriend's birthday, what a lovely gesture! Overall, a good visit but will be even better if the food were to be improved
5
Having landed in Singapore only two nights ago and to have the venue so ready and so beautifully decorated is a blessing for me! BLS offered a very private area if you are planning to pop the question here! (Usually the minimum spend would be $500 to use the area)The waiters were genuinely helpful and wanted to help us to every single small detail. The food was excellent - I recommend the prime rib! :) The appetizers and dessert (in the semi buffet style) was also good and the chocolate fondue was a huge hit with the future missus. Having the proposal at St Regis also meant being able to take some additional photos with your flowers and balloons around the nice chandeliers. The whole experience was amazing and it cannot be better
5
Fantastic welcome cocktails at Astor bar, given a special table with great privacy, buffet style hopping from the seafood selection to healthy salad bar, meat station to cheese corner, bloody mary station (all you can mix and drink) to the desert bar with fondue? Must haves The Foie Gras, The juicy steak from the meat station and the caviar from the seafood section; wine selection is great. Staffs are extremely friendly and helpful, a fantastic brunch experience for a special occasion
1
Beyond the mesmerizing live piano and the grandeur of the chandelier, the high tea is a disturbing contrast. There was absolutely no fanfare in the food variety, food quality and staff service. The arrival experience was marred by a long wait of 30 minutes despite everyone in the queue had confirmed reservations. There was no splendour in the buffet line as portrayed by the Hotel. There was no warm food. The humble cucumber sushi you might have read about is real! Sandwiches and pastries on the polished three-tiered silver stand are nothing we cannot find in a neighbourhood bakery. The food items that were depleted were never once replenished. Guests' tables were often cluttered as dishes were not cleared fast enough. It is time the Hotel stop riding on the property chain's prestige and start reflecting on Brasserie Les Saveurs' relevance. Please stop wasting diners' time
5
Me and my friends have afternoon tea together just a few days ago. The restaurant decoration is gorgeous which made the atmosphere in the afternoon so finest. Average food quality but must say great for the selection which is variety and worth for the price compare with another hotel in Singapore. It was such a good time together with live piano, the pianist provided a bespoke performance when he knew that I'm Thai, he played Thai song! I really want the restaurant staff to provide more personalized service even we are not a hotel in house guest as well
3
We were really looking forward to our experience at Brassiere and the evening started out well drinks in the bar, great food and service. Then it just turned for the worst we could not get a waiter, waited 20 minutes for drinks, almost 40 minutes for our wine. The restaurant was not full and it ruined our evening having to almost shout to get any attention. The setting is great, the food and wine menu excellent but with such bad service this is not to be repeated
4
I brought my friend to this restaurant to celebrate her birthday. Service was excellent. We were served by Jason who was attentive to our needs and very kindly arranged for a small birthday cake to mark the occasion.The buffet appetiser was good value for money but we were stuffed by the time our main course arrived. I had the prime rib which was good. My friend had the wagyu beef cheek which we felt had a bit strong beef smell. Did not have a chance to try the other mains but I am sure they would be excellent. Lots of desserts and they all looked yummy but we were already stuffed... Love the praline chocolates.Would definitely come back again with such excellent service and food
5
the staffs were very attentive and observant and interacted well with us. love the customization of service towards each customer as well! Also provided us with a private corner when i requested for it :
5
I went there with a friend and seated near to the window (upon request) on a Saturday afternoon. The weather on that day was good - not too hot. The scones, waffles, classic sandwiches are served in a three-tiered stand. Besides this, there are separate section for assortment of western and local delights. For the tea selection, they serve TWG tea. Of course, they serve coffee too. The food was good and we enjoyed them very much
5
I celebrated my daughter's birthday with 2 of her buddies and we had a great time. Service and food were impeccable. I was hesitant to order the beef given some bad reviews read but to my surprise, the Wagyu beef was extremely tender
5
10 our of 10 Afternoon Tea at St Regis Hotel. We had a wonderful afternoon and I have no complaints whatsoever. Staff efficient and friendly; food and variety exceptional. Will certainly be returning on my next visit to Singapor
5
We had an excellent experience right from the reception to payment of the bill. The main course 'duck confit' was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. My guest thoroughly enjoyed the beef cheek which was soft and flavourful. The buffet spread had a wide selection of premium ingredients. Unfortunately, could not enjoy much of the buffet spread as the main course was of a generous portion. The service staff were attentive to our needs. We will definitely make it a monthly event
2
I've dine there twice, and i was disappointed in both the food quality and the service. Skip any beef orders here and do not expect any thing special of the the servic

I would have given 5 stars to this place if it wasn't for the below par service.Granted I didn't order a bottle of wine for my dinner, but that doesn't mean I don't deserve attention! Service was not to st.regis standards at all. I had to pour my own drink, keep calling the waiter over, it was tedious, became more of a chore. Appetizer selection was ok... a caesar salad bar? come on guys.. at st. regis... the audacity to offer me a caesar salad (which i have to make myself) at the buffet counter.. come on! am I on a hidden tv show?? Followed by big giant rice filled maki/sushi which was just stuffed with cucumber, radish, and fake crab... guys come on..seriously... The I had the prime rib for my main - tasty!, however what is that non-sense that came with the prime rib. Like airplane food / garnish. The FOUR baby pototoes that I got were dry, i had ONE asparagus cut in half served on the plate, followed by TWO baby carrots.. This is a complete joke! for 80$!!! The prime rib although tasty was thin and small portioned. The wine jus (which I had to ask for because I was forgotten) was cold/warm. Dessert: great selection, probably the highlight of the restaurant. However had two shortcomings - 1) the ice cream was melting / too soft 2) the cheese table was not checked on/refilled as a result had only brie, mozerella. Despite 10 diff labels of cheese shown. I have been to st.regis all over the world - esp. being a spg member. But by far this was sub-par. For the love of god would the manager please get this restaurant in shape! its embarrassing not just to you , but to the brand
5
Afternoon tea at the restaurant was just superb. I went alone but they were all so attentive. The hostess offered me a selection of reading materials. Food was great but service was better. Justin and Josephine kept dropping by to check if everything was alright. They were very professional. As expected from the St regis. Thanks to Josephine, Justin, Kristin and Jason. Thanks for the great time

After being spoilt by LaBrezza (Italian Restaurant at St Regis), we really wanted to try the degustation menu by Brasserie. Unfortunately, for similar pricing, we were not impressed by the food quality and presentation. Our reserved seats were too close to the piano, and we were not able to have a decent conversation without shouting across to each other. The flashing lights at the fountain were also very distracting. Thankfully, my partner was facing the fountain. If not, I would have lost my appetite completely! However, need to stress that this is a personal preference. For the dishes, the foie gras didn't melt in mouth and was overcooked (chewy). One of our soup had a piece of plastic in it. Gnocchi was cooked through but there was nothing exiting about it. Was surprised that the fish was rather bland and not naturally sweet. Beef was soft but was very heavily seasoned. Creme brulee's was tasty but serving was too large. Tea was the best - try the flora St Regis tea. Service was excellent as expected from St Regis. They apologised for the plastic and offered wine. Since we don't drink, they gave us a box of chocolates at the end of the dinner. They were very delicious!My recommendation - go for the semi-buffet instead (connoisseur dinner) if you are eating here. If you really want to try the degustation menu, just go for 5 course, and only if you have not been to LaBrezza (second floor)
5
The high tea spread was spectacular, with the three-tier set and a buffet spread. We were so full that we didn't even eat dinner after that. We were served by Jason, and he's so friendly and humorous. He was very attentive to our needs and always serving us with a smile. Of course, the ambience in St Regis is first class as always. Definitely value for money
4
Always like the ambience during lunch time. Natural light, high ceiling with full glass view. Chandelier completes the luxe feel of the hall. The selection of appetizer was very good quality and interesting spread. From the smoked halibut to cured meat and cod terrine. These are all superb in taste and quality. Cut fresh tropical fruit were presented in the beautiful candle holder. Not forgetting the wide array of dessert. They would get approval from sweet tooth!The main course I ordered was Sea bass, it was great but could be more delish with a little more salt. The skin of sea bass was crackling crispy, the flesh is super tender, pity is a little bland for me but with a dash of salt, it was ok.Don't forget to get a small amount of candied pecans in the jar. These are really addictive. Crunchy and sweetness which is just right, will never keep your hands away from it.Like the way the service staff patiently taking orders for my coffee. Decaff skinny cappuccino. He was very polite and smiles never been away from him.I must also commend the service staff all across all departments. The wait staff are prompt and courteous and genuinely friendly. Even the bell boy was very polite and has nice words to start the chat while waiting for the vehicle. Kudos to St. Regis training! These are gems in service industry. Would I come again? Definitely for overall pleasant experience
5
Excellent ambience as you would have expected for a top hotel. Good spread of hors dâ€™oeuvres and desert for the semi-buffet. The Wagyu Beef Bourguignon is excellent. Superb and attentive service by the restaurant manager and his staff

Not sure how to give an accurate rating for this restaurant. We went there twice for lunch on consecutive Saturdays and the experience was like heaven for the first visit and straight back down to earth on the second visit. So I averaged a 5 and a 1 and the result was 6/2 = 3.The first visit on a Saturday was almost perfect. The food was extremely good. The service impeccable. My wife was all praise for her lamb chop. (You can see the photo of the lamb chop on the first visit, it looked so appetizing). My cod was not bad too but I wanted to try the lamb chop myself before giving a final review. So we went there again on the next Saturday. But little did we realize that on the second visit the same dish tasted so differently that we wouldn't have come again if that was what we got on the first visit. The lamb chop was overdone that we requested for a change. Even the replacement lamb chop was only slightly better than the initial one (the last 2 photos showed the lamb chop that was cut. Didn't remember to take photo before starting on the food). It was also very tough and dry on the inside. The condiments and presentation also looked very different from our first visit the week before. It didn't looked to me to be done by the same chef from the previous week. After the meal we discussed whether to come back again for a third try. We finally decided to move upstairs and made reservation at LaBrezza and trust Chef Armando to do his magic instead
5
My partner and I are regular patrons for the Sunday brunch. As far as buffets go it is in my opinion one of the top three in Singapore. Delicious bloody Mary's, free flow of champagne, moderate servings of caviar, lobsters, oysters, well stocked cheese selection, good quality salads and meet cuts, roast beef and a huge desert selection. What makes this place special is the staff, they are all super friendly and no request is too big. Entertainment is fantastic and changes from week to week creating a grest ambience. The captain today was Taj, he is an extremely polite well groomed young man with exceptional service. This place isn't cheap but is worth that little extra cost
5
It was our first time having our Afternoon English Tea at St Regis Singapore. I must say that we enjoyed ourselves the food was great and also their First Class Service! Special thanks to the lady in the picture .. she was so friendly and welcoming..
5
Every morning when i went i would start to try and figure out what type of breakfast i was in the mood for (american, local singaporean, or french) this restaurant met all my needs and expectations. Great variety for a hotel brunch spot
5
We went to the St.Regis for afternoon tea in the Brasserie les Saveurs. We went with our grandchildren, it was fantastic and provided for both adults and children. If we had known we would not have eaten for 36 hours before going as there was so much on offer. Children friendly, staff very courteous and as I have said,food superb. We shall return.Thank you St.Regis.Roy Flitto
5
Cozy ambience and very relaxing mood the restaurant is very classy and the buffet spread is good. Plus the fact that you don't need to take most of the food in the counter there will be few menu which chef will bring over to your table and with selection of your own main course its really fantastic! We enjoy indeed our brunch with my client
5
The restaurant setting is very nice and service was excellent. Had the buffet breakfast - Good selection eventhough limited. Separate menu including gourmet omellette, japanese breakfast among others is also included in the Breakfast Buffet. Best croissant
5
I spent almost 3 months in St. Regis in Singapore and had daily breakfasts and occasional dinners in this restaurant. Loved the food, service, atmosphere and the music immensely and have enjoyed the experience very, very much. The music at breakfasts created a very "French" mood and at dinners was relaxing and enjoyable.I would like to specifically thank Paisly who always was very polite, friendly, helpful and was placing my standard breakfast order the moment she saw me every morning without me asking to do so. @Paisly - thank you so much
4
My friend recommended me to this restaurant for my hubby's birthday dinner. We love the romantic setting and ambience, great service staff too! We choose the semi buffet which comes with a main course with appetizer and dessert buffet. At the end of our meal, the staff bring the complementary birthday cake for my hubby which is quite a decent size. We are quite full by the time and they are so kind to pack the cake for us to bring home. The food is really worth the price and definitely will come back again
5
My wife and I enjoyed coming to Brasserie Les Saveurs for the afternoon tea, with champagne, in a beautiful yet relaxing setting. The tea set was nicely decorated and had variety. It's a little oasis in a busy city.We also came for the Christmas buffet dinner and think that it's one of the best in Singapore in terms of experience - not to mention the menu of caviar, lobsters, roasted meats, and arrays of desserts. It also had a choir singing Christmas carols for 30 minutes.It's a place of providing high standards and happy experience.
5
I visit this restaurant a few times a month because the food is great and service is attentive. Quiet ambience and nice background music makes the dining experience always a pleasure and relaxing. We enjoy the black cod and also the appetizer spread is excellent! What differentiates this place is the attentive service. My friend and I have quite a few food allergies and the waiters, like Josephine and Kartie always make sure that these are communicated to the chef and would also offer to make changes to the menu to accommodate our allergies.
5
It was difficult to decide a venue for our brunch but we choose St Regis Brasserie for the good review of a friend. We were sure not dissapointed as the ambience was great and the Jazz band lift up the ambience even better.I shall say we had a great time! But the ambience was a small consolation compare to the great service we received from your staff Josephine. Always putting up a big smile tirelessly. Checking on us attentively and giving us that SINCERE from the heart service. Thank you so much Josephine! You have made our day!We will definitely be back again after our trip! 5* Venue 6* Service
5
Fantastic food with top-notch service, stayed for 3 months and seldom skipped the breakfast (alternative is precious 15 extra minutes of sleep!) - never failed to give me a great start of the day. Make sure you talk to Paisly - lovely girl with a beautiful smile. :
5
Great rillette, great summerfruits gazpacho and carrot soup, great bread (I tried every single bread in their bread basket, and I vote the oregano my favorite, followed by the multigrain.) And oh, the make-your-own Caesar salad. Such a treat! Surpassing all this is the assistant manager Kartieâ€™s warm service and his attentive, but breezy, easygoing style. His voice and manners are pleasant and calming. Everyone else in his service team were polite, discreet, attentive. And I loved the Julius Meinl cappucino cups. They were designed to be ergonomic, easy to hold, slip your index finger through, and thoroughly enjoy your shot of caffe

Tried this outlet as we were hotel guests (St Regis). Breakfast buffet spread is quite generous, although no one item stands out except for the offer of steamed crab legs. The place is lovely though, and this makes this restaurant an excellent venue for special meals and business meetings. Service is attentive, except for one Chinese staff who kept clearing the table without checking if guests were done with their plated food.
5
Lovely ambience. Pianist on the grand piano adds another level of class to this place. Great place for a relaxing catch up with friends or meals with your loved one/family under the chandeliers. The upper deck with the curtains would be a more ideal place for friendly banters with friends as conversations inside the restaurant is usually kept to a low volume. Nice service as well
5
Buffet breakfast catering to both Western and Asian tastes. Waffles or eggs cooked fresh to order and brought to table. Great way to start the day
5
Not really one to rave about hotel coffee houses but Les Saveurs is not your typical run of the mill hotel breakfast joint. We had a great dinner there this evening but even better than the nicely grilled seafood and perfectly cooked striploin we had, was the fantastic service provided by Mr Muhd Hatta and his colleagues. From the greeting at the door, to the recommendation of our meal, right to the bill and the very thoughtful offer of a car park coupon, the service was spot on. Thank you for making a simple evening out such a delightful one in the end
4
This was just over fifty Sing which is super cheap for a meal unless you head out to the suburbs to the really local places (which are fantastic). For that you don't need lunch or dinner and can see this as a late lunch or an early dinner or both. I went alone and that was fine. You get savoury pastries (which are OK) and sandwiches (not the highlight). A kind of lobster soup/pie is good and they will make you savoury or sweet pancakes to order as well. There is an excellent selection of scones and cream as well as a fantastic buffet of desserts. As an afternoon tea the savouries and the sandwiches could be better but as a meal it is excellent value for money and you can of course eat your fill at the buffet
4
This is probably my 5th visit to Brasserie Les Saveurs, i had both good and bad experiences here. It was nice to see Louie back at the resturant again and relive the St Regis excellent service, together with another staff named Jason, who makes our dining experience a pleasure. However, i would say the selection of the buffet wasnt as good as before and the Lamb rack i ordered was too raw and under seasoned. I hope the management will look into this
5
Celebrated my birthday here at Brasserie Les Saveurs restaurant with my wife today. Awesome experience with the service level over here, especially Josephine who served us. Very attentive to details and like her always be ready to serve attitude! Always wears a great smile on her face! Love this place and especially the service over here. This is our second time here and will definitely visit more in the near future.Great job!Warmest regards,Joachim Sen

We were here for semi-lunch buffet. The food at the buffet was limited and mediocre. After taking a few sips from my tea cup, I found there was a red lip print on my cup. Our main courses were wagyu beef bourguignon. The quality and texture of the beef were inconsistent. One was over cooked while the other one was ok. We shared the "ok" one and only a few bites of the "overcooked" one. It was way too mushy. We gave the feedbacks to the manager who came by and asked for it. He didn't gave much response but insisted the beef should be cooked like that. Later he returned and said to my wife he would take care of the bill as she wasn't "happy" with her main course and also for the lip prints thing. Felt a bit weird but had to say he looked really indifferent while speaking and not sincere at all. He then couldn't be found. We still went to checked out to make sure the manager had informed his staff before he left. However we were told to pay the full price. We explained to the staff that the message we got from the manager, she obviously didn't know and she needed to check with the manager again. It took us quite a while about 15-20mins she still couldn't find the manager. I learned that if using AMEX I could get one main course for free. I didn't want to make it complicated and wasted too much time on that. So I left my card to the staff for making payment. When I returned from washroom, the staff told me the manager later changed to give 20% off instead and they have already charged it on my card...The manager even didn't bother to come over, was just standing from the other side and watching his staff dealing with me. It was really weird and confusing and such a poor handling of feedbacks. Would not recommend

We enjoyed the semi-buffet dinner at this luxuriously setup restaurant. Service staff were polite, attentive and provided us excellent service throughout the evening. The starters and dessert spread were good quality, a nice enough spread that went nicely with the main course of their signature roasted black angus prime rib which came in just the right portion to enjoy the dessert spread! If you ask me if this is the best French restaurant our sunny island has to offer, I will say no and I believe that there are better french places to enjoy the finest French cuisine but these won't be able to offer the ambience and the space that this St Regis restaurant can offer

We went there for Dinner and opted for the Set Meal. The options were excellent. There is a huge variety of starters, laid out as a buffet ranging from salads to sushi. There were 5 to 6 options to select from in the Main Dish. The desserts were the best part, similar to the entrees laid out as a buffet.For wine aficionados there is huge selection served with the cheese platter.The ambience is perfect for special occasions. Special thanks to Josephine for making our experience memorable

To whom it may concern,I am writing this to express my gratitude towards your service staff at Brasserie Les Saveurs on 15 January 2017. Michelle and myself, Catherine, were in awe of how well we were treated. I would say it was the best experience I have ever had with service staff to date and I commend your staff for this. From the moment we were taken to our table to the point of our departure, we were amazed at how well we were treated. Kudos.Special thanks to the following staff for all their help, care, concern, attention and service:AngelieJasonPaulJosephine SriThe above staff went above and beyond to make our presence feel extremely comfortable and welcome. Words cannot express how great the experience at St Regis was today but I assure you that it will not be my last visit.Kudos to the staff for such a great service on 15 January 2017 at Brasserie Les Saveurs during the Afternoon Tea duty. Michelle and I both thank all of you and are sincerely grateful. You guys have gone beyond our expectations and have topped all our experiences combined. Best Regards,Catherine Sebastia

Went there with my Singaporean best friends. I had no idea that the afternoon tea was partial buffet style. I was not a big fan of buffet. But I quite enjoyed their food spread. I get to try some non traditional scones which was quite delicious. They have nice environment and great ambiance. But service was just a bit slow for us. Maybe we have more pax, so it took them so time to bring us our tier plates
4
The ambience of the setting won me over at first glance, and we were quickly ushered to our seats. The high tea comes with a three tiered selections of pastries, tarts and sandwiches as well a buffet with sweet and savoury offerings. The place certainly offered more desserts than savoury options, so if you are a fan of sweet treats, you may wish to check this place out. I was impressed by the service standards as well - we were invited to sign up for the Starwood Privileges card and entitled to a 10% discount immediately. Great job! Thank you

I ate in the brasserie daily of over a week. The food was exceptional with lovely service that you would expect from a quality hotel like St Regi

been to this place a couple of times in past few years.....as im a regular at the hotel. unfortunatly i keep getting a bad experience......they do really good breakfast and high tea. but avoid dinner.our duck was raw, our fish was not to salty.....and it took one hour and a half for the food to come. when we said clearly to please bring food out fast as we were dining with 3 kids.the floor manager is really good, but the whole operation is bellow standard for a luxury restaurant. st regis is a reaply good hotel, its a shame their restaurant are at this level. if you stay here go eat at the reagant hotel across the street.....cheaper and 100 times better.

Went for early Xmas celebration dinner with my family. We were all looking forward to a great evening there with some good food since it is the first time all 7 of us were dining that night... We were disappointed when several of us wanted to order prime rib as our main course for the buffet dinner. We were told they ran out of prime ribs! That was rather shocking to us all that there is such a thing as running out of a main course for a 6-star restaurant! They said there was sudden order of over 20 prime rib for the main course so they have no more prime ribs left. They offered striploin instead but we weren't sure though 3 of us opted for that. What came as a pleasant surprise was they managed to find more prime ribs after we already placed the order for other main course. Not sure how they managed to, great effort! I wanted to cancel my turkey order but it was a little late because turkey was already done. The manager, however, offered almost additional serving of prime ribs! That was impressive. I must say, service was superb! However, I am not sure about the food quality of the buffet (or was it the service for the buffet?). Quite a lot of dishes were almost empty including the desserts by the time we got to the buffet. Yes, we started later than most of the guests and ended also after the buffet was over. Yet, this was the first time I went to a buffet at a 5-6 star hotel with food running out! Not a good "sight" with empty bowls and plates around. Overall buffet food quality was so so as well. Can't think of anything I like on the buffet table. They are all just ok! Nonetheless, it was still an ok night since the prime ribs saved the night!

Went for the festive lunch buffet on 14 December 2016 with my boss. It was a semi-buffet which we can choose our main course from the menu. Choices of buffet was quite reasonable and I love the cheese section too. I ordered the pork and sweet potato for the main course. Portion of food was fine considering that comes with the semi-buffet. The service of the staff was excellent. They were very friendly and polite. Overall, I love the place, the food and the service of the restaurant. Will be happy to bring my guest(s) to here again

Had afternoon tea on a Friday afternoon. The place wasn't busy and we received very attentive service from the staff. There was the buffet spread and the classy three-tiered stand. The food on the tiered stand was an utter disappointment. The sweet delights were way too sweet, and the sandwiches were of boring flavors like egg & mayonnaise, tomato, cucumber and cream cheese. There was a total lack of creativity in the menu. The bread for the sandwiches were very dry and hard, as if they were leftovers. For the savoury quiche, salty was the only adjective I could come up with. Fortunately, we had nice TWG tea to down the food with. Can't go wrong with TWG. The saving grace was the nice ambience, soothing music from the pianist and the attentive service provided. The food was a flop for such a great hotel. I still feel sick thinking of it as I type this review

We had come to enjoy a high tea for a special occasion and although the setting was stunning, the food was below par and the air conditioning almost made us wish we brought our coats. One of the additional food items was a pastry covered tea cup with what I would describe as a seafood chowder within. After two mouthfuls it left a not so pleasant after taste but the worst was yet to come. That evening and 3 days later we're still feeling the effects of this nasty treat with severe food poisoning. Not worth the expense

We ate dinner at the restaurant (husband and daughter just over 2 years old) in a weekday night. We used the Amex offer for 2 people and will therefore get 50% back off the food bill from Amex.We took the semi-buffet option, so we took our starter and dessert from the buffet and ordered a main. My husband had the prime rib and I chose the black cod. We also ordered a cheese & ham toast or for our daughter. The toaster came with salad leaves and mayo to dip (they gave us toddler friendly cutlery and crockery).The mains were delicious, the prime rib cooked medium/rare was particularly good - my daughter thought so too as she ate a lot of it rather than her toastie! I would recommend letting any little children just have from the buffet and share part of your main as then they are free).The starters in the buffet included sushi, prawns (that we're very tasty), breads, meats & salads. The dessert buffet had lots of little puddings individually served and bread and butter pudding that you could scoop as well as ice cream. It was a good selection and the ones I tried were very nice.We just had iced water to drink, but the wine menu looked decent. For our meals our bill was $105 i think (incl the 50% off our food - I don't think that included a discount in the child's meal).I would recommend taking a shawl or cardigan or wearing long sleeves as the air con was up high I did find it cold. The restaurant has big windows and my daughter loved the 'dancing' water and lights. We also loved the Christmas decorations in the hotel lobby, the tree was beautiful and so were the garlands going up the stairway (great photo opportunity).We loved the meal and evening - the restaurant had a lovely feel and massive sparkling chandlers! We're already planning another visit

Besides enjoying their amazing breakfast every morning we also went for their Sunday brunch and a dinner at Brasserie Les Saveurs. Everything was outstanding, the food, the beverages, the service, the entertainment.Especially their Sunday brunch was outstanding again: the selection of food from the buffet was amazing, the a la carte dishes were fresh and absolutely delicious, the champagne and wine selection for brunch was great and service was always delivered with a smile.The restaurant itself is stunning with the Baccarat ceiling and a view of the pool and gardens. Also, their live music was very good.This is definitely a place we will always come back to. Highly recommend it
5
I had lunch recently with a Friend here and was delighted to find a very good value set lunch which featured a good range of appetisers and desserts and also a choice of a main course from 5 picks. It is a ideal restaurant for just about any occasion and I will definitely return! Enjoyed it tremendously

I was not the type to feel giddy about sipping hot tea amidst sumptuous desserts in a luxurious hotel, but Brasserie Les Saveurs definitely caught my attention!I have never explored the world of tea because I have always thought they were too bitter for my taste, but the restaurant's tea was absolutely perfect that I didn't even need milk with it. It had a herbal element to it but it did not make it bitter, not too bland either, just perfect to balance the sweetness level of their snacks.I don't know if they serve the same set of snacks every afternoon, but I loved the fact that they had lots of pastries involving strawberries and chocolates - strawcolates in a glass, on the cake, in my tart...It was the yummiest treat ever! But they had other delights too. I was so busy with the beautiful and delicious desserts that I didn't notice there were light snacks at the other side of the buffet table - sushi, bread, a variety of spreads. I don't remember their names but I do remember they were delicious.But really, even if they just served the desserts, I still would have rated them 5. I loved the ambiance set by the Victorian-inspired furniture from the chairs, tables, carpet, chandeliers, curtains. There was soft, classical piano music being played LIVE. And let me highlight excellent service that made me feel like royalty for the afternoon!Thank you to the word-class service from the staff of St. Regis for this magical experience! Keep up the good work :

This review most likely stems from my being used to the American standard hotel which generally does not have well- stocked continental breakfast with ethnic choices/local cuisine and tends to charge exorbitant fees. True to many Asian and European hotels, this restaurant is included with most stays as a breakfast options. The selection includes excellent fresh fruits and breads, Asian foods, ready-made omelettes and a wide range of other choices.

Loved the food but wished that the shape of the restaurant wasn't that elongated such that we had to walk the entire length to see all the sprea

Nice food area overlooking the water garden. This was used for the breakfasts and evening meals. Great place to meet client
5
Nice breakfast with a la carte options, lovely staff, super service! Quiet restaurant with nice views over the pool

We liked quiet places with small bites music for afternoon tea. This place provided just that. Piano played by a nice gentleman was good but only intermittent. The servers did not explain what the three tier and other food served was, leading my friend to over eat at the buffet counter first while waiting. Overall still good ambience and reasonably varied spread of food that tasted just above average. The tea selection and flavor are both disappointing, compared to those I had at the four seasons hotel Singapore and regent hotel. SPG Members get discounts

Visit date: 25th Sept 2016.I had come with relatively high expectations as this restaurant is housed in St Regis. It certainly did not disappoint. Not in a good way but contrary actuallyThere was a lack of service all night long. From poor service during orders. To cold asparagus soup that is supposed to be warm. And worst of all, water pooling in the pot of ice cream. We just wanted to check if the chiller was at the right temperature n functional as all the ice cream we scooped out was melting and watery. After bringing it up to an industrious young, wait staff, he brings it up to the more "senior" , evidently less bothered bespectacled wait Staff/ manager named Louie. He take a glance, closes the cover whispers while pointing at our table and walks away. No changes to the ice cream were made, nor any thanks offered for informing them. But rather treated our feedback as a hassle. I hope the melted ice cream is still safe for consumption after sitting there all evening. The food to top it all off was mediocre, the beef cheek was certainly not Wagyu. Or if it really was, was a pity, because it was certainly destroyed by the marmite/soya sauce it was stewed it contrary to the red wine jus it claimed to come in. All in all, much improvement needs to happen in a restaurant such as this. And certainly, if the most senior guy's attitude is like Louie's where is the hope for the juniors who look up to and learn from him

Friday evening dinner, with 4. All opted for the connoisseur dinner, which offers a select list of main courses and starters and dessert from the buffet. Reservations, greeting and seating was done efficiently and politely. The buffet spread (and mains) were probably more international than French - there was a selection of salads, platter of sushi, breads, cold cuts and soup. Noticeable by their absence was fresh shellfish or seafood. There was also a separate cheese trolley. Desserts included chocolate fondue, and various tarts, sorbets and cheesecakes, and cut fruits. The overall choice for the buffet was smaller than in other hotel offerings, but sufficient provided your expectatations are aligned. Coffee and tea were included. The mains: the prime rib helpings were very generous indeed, and overall suited for large eaters. The prawns and hokkaido scallops were reasonably sized, while the rack of lamb (although generous for lamb) was probably the smallest looking main around.Dinner service was patchy. The mains took a long time to emerge, probably because the staff and kitchen were struggling to cope with the dinner rush. However, for some reason, the waitress appeared to take umbrage with our table when we enquired about the delay for the mains: subsequent requests took a very long time to attract her attention (e.g. request for wine, and requesting the bill). I don't think this is your typical experience, though, as the rest of the staff (though busy) were friendly and trying hard.The ambience was different - old style luxury, in relatively quiet and small room, which leads to greater intimacy.In summary, reasonable international food with a buffet / main course combo, patchy service but this is probably atypical for St. Regis. Having said which, I think the standard bearer for this sort of combination is probably Basilico at the Regent Hotel, though it's a little more pricey. 3.5 stars, would have been 4 bar service

With a downpour outside, we sat and listened to the twinkling of a nearby piano and indulged in perhaps one of THE best afternoon teas we have ever experienced. Both a tier system and buffet await for you to enjoy traditional finger sandwiches, scones and tea. Choose from sumptious desserts and other fancy pieces. Beautiful!

Was looking forward to a 5 star french dining experience. The style of dining has been changed can only assume due to demand, to include a semi buffet entree dessert option. We have eaten here on several occasions & it has gone down in our opinion, on previous visits we have been left with that WOW feeling. The french oysters were served in pairs, I requested 1/2 doz 3 of each but this could not be done (I settled for 2/4). They were nothing special tasted like pacific oysters, were not very plump & had a lot of grit in them. My seared scallops & grilled prawns with young potatoes & confit cherry tomato (1) were served cold but on a warm plate so I assume my meal was ready for some time before it was served. I must add however my partner's meal was enjoyed cauliflower soup & roasted prime rib. Service was ok, I recommend not sitting in the elevated booths, although private & romantic its easy to be forgotten
5
We were given our own cosy and quiet corner, which was much appreciated. The staff went all out to make that day a memorable one for us. Food was superb. We opted for the semi-buffet and were actually quite full after our appetizers, which consisted of delicious sushi rolls and salads. We went easy on our main course so that we could try some of the desserts later. Totally worth it! If you're looking to entertain your guests or want somewhere romantic to dine with your special someone, this is definitely the place to go. My friends and I will keep coming back here.

I made a reservation online to reserve a table in this restaurant to celebrate my 10th wedding anniversary with my family. It was nice to receive a confirmation reply that also indicated that they would be providing us a complimentary cake for the special occasion. When we were there for the lunch on that faithful day, my family were amazed at the grandeur deco and ambiance of the restaurant.The service provided were good and the food was beautifully nice. Although there weren't much variety at the buffet spread, the quality of food was good. Overall, impressive ambiance with good food and service. Although the service could have been better if they had remembered that it was my 10th wedding anniversary and somehow written on the cake (or something) "Happy Anniversary!!", instead of serving the complimentary cake and be asked by the waiter "may i know what's the joyous occasion".... in my mind was thinking... if you didnt know, then why is there a cake for us???? Duh......That's the reason why i mentioned.... "Nice place for romantic meal but not the best i know".... room for improvement on both service and thoughtfulnes

I've not written TripAdvisor reviews for quite a while. But, BLS currently certain deserves a better rating than number 556 of restaurants in Singapore. Recently, I've been for dinner twice. Simply exceptional service. I can't remember names too well, but I recall Mr Kartie, Mr Hata, Mr Louie, Ms Josephine and Mr Zun Hao were all kind, professional, interested and friendly. On both occasions, I marvelled at how could they be giving me virtually the best service I've ever had in Singapore. The reason is that this place is called a brasserie and should be judged accordingly. The ambience at night is magical, with the water fountains playing outside. Sort of a mini Versailles? There was also a pianist. The music was not intrusive. Rather elegant, I thought.Food. Ah. Although billed as French, you must not expect the food to be authentically French; and you'll be delighted. It's more international. A beautiful selection of appetisers and really delicious desserts. Not a huge number of items but more than enough. I'm now going to have lunch there, and I'll report again

I came here for dinner together with a friend. The restaurant has a very nice ambience, with a dancing water fountain just outside the ceiling to floor glass window. We ordered the semi buffet dinner set, which comes with a main course and the free flow buffet of starters and desserts. I had the tiger prawns and scallops and my guest had a grilled striplion. Both were very good. We were also spoilt for choices for the starters, where you can have soup, cured salmon, a variety of sushi, and specially prepared crab cakes and seafood starters. The desserts range was a great one, plenty of cakes to choose from, and nice pretty glasses serving the mouses, also not forgetting there is the chocolate fondue, and different flavours of ice cream. The dinner finished off with a pot of TWG tea, we had the Earl Grey.The service here was top notch, and most importantly you don't feel the rush through the serving. The service crew was rather attentive and ensured that you are done with the starters before serving the main courses.It's certainly worth a second visit, I still have items on the menu to try out

I had my breakfast in this restaurant during my staycation at St Regis. I was quite pleased with the service and the ambience. Quite relaxing and luxurious decor
5
The ambience is sophisticated, the staff are accommodating and the food wonderful, fresh, well prepared and presented.
4
We were there on a Friday afternoon for high tea. It was a very pleasant experience! Service was top notch, food were fantastic. There was a wide selection in their high tea buffet. Love their crepes & chocolate fountain.
4
We had 5 breakfasts in total here during our stay and one dinner. I have opted to only rate the breakfast as there was quite a variance between the 2 experiences. There is certainly an array of international choices available as well as 2 omelette and waffle stations. Plus there is always the option to choose from the menu if you honestly can't find anything from the buffet. Their signature breakfast dish is the lobster bisque and prawn omelette with avruga pearls which was simply delicious. But I can also say that the wonderful lady who made my normal omelette every other morning was up there as well. Staff are very helpful and pleasant. They are quietly professional as is their management team. Pricing is standard for this level of hotel so no surprises there. I have been very happy all round with my stay at St Regis and hope to return some time in the near future
4
Breakfast-brunch is a delight to have at Brasserie Les Saveurs. There's plenty to choose from with fresh fruits, breads, local offerings, the staple continental selections as well as TWG teas upon request. Wait staff are also very accommodating
5
Best breakfast experience in Singapore as all is well managed and efficient . The privacy side of lunch or dinner is very effective
5
We loved the fresh seafood, sushi, steak, champagne, oysters ... and the whole experience. First it was pre-brunch drinks in the Astor bar from 11-12, then 3 hours of divine food. Throw away any notions of buffet food being poor quality, everything was just amazing from the quality and range of food, to the service levels. If you have a free Sunday in Singapore, you would do a lot worse than experiencing this brunch. Although do make sure you book in advance
5
I was pleasantly surprised by the excellent service when my family and I had lunch at St Regis Brasserie Les Saveurs on Saturday May 15. The lunch buffet meal was excellent as is to be expected from a hotel such as St Regis. However the attentiveness and politeness of the serving staff enhanced the overall enjoyment of an afternoon family lunch. In particular, Assistant Manager Kartie Gunuzalan was attentive to the needs of my wife, daughter and myself. Kartie knowing that we enjoyed a good wine with our lunch meal, recommended an excellent cabernet sauvignon alternative to the standard Syrah on the menu. The full bodied wine complemented the Angus strip-loin and made the meal something special. This initiative from Kartie is much appreciated and he is to be commended for his skill and attention to the customer. Thank you

Buffet is nice, mixed international food buffet. Wine is ok... but regarding the service :One gnocchi and one beef ordered one hour ago.. still waiting :
4
Have eaten here many times and the buffet is a lovely choice of pretty much anything you want, but a bit light on the variety of fruits available, the staff is very friendly and helpfu
5
The breakfast here served here is definitely a class of its own. Amazing food. I will recommend this to anyone visiting Singapore. This is a place YOU HAVE TO VISIT
4
The semi-buffet lunch is from Monday to Saturday. It includes a main course( salmon, sea bass, chicken, pork , beef ) with the starter, appertiser, salad, and dessert served buffet style. There are also many kinds of bread, one soup, sushi, cheese etc. The dessert spread has many varieties. Tea and coffee are included in the price of $54++. Maybank credit card entitles one to 15% discount. The ceiling is very high and view of the swimming pool and the surrounding trees adds to the cosy atmosphere. Recommended for group gathering as well
3
Breakfast is breakfast where ever you go in the world Just not sure what the duck and chicken was doing in a breakfast men
5
It started off with 1 hr of cocktails. The bloody mary and chilli pad mari were awesome. The food was just divine, a great selection of seafood and desserts. You also got to choose a main from the menu. I give it a 10 out of 10
5
What is better than having stayed at the luxurious room a night before, then be welcomed by a wonderful and elegant dining room for your breakfast the following morning. The selection of cheese is wonderful. The choice of food is plenty. Really a delightful luxurious breakfast
5
Was a good experience to dine in here. A very warm welcome and greeting from the Hostess she was given us the table by the window. The first we dunno much about the "Semi buffet" how it goes, but Paisley was very patience and explain to us. After that, Alvin has come over and serve us the food, he was very attentive. Thanks to Alvin. Food is delicious... We like the dessert very much. It was a great lunch for us. I will always remember their warm welcome. Highly recommend to everyone.
4
I have been here a couple times for afternoon tea but today was the first for the semi dinner buffet. Food from the buffet line was great with my favourite duck and pork rilettes, paired alongside warm breads (the heating lamps were powerful). Love the refreshing cucumber gazpacho as well. Nonetheless, the prime ribs I had for mains had sauces that was too bland. The accompanying vegetables were a let down and tasteless. The desserts on the other hand, was always a strong contender at St Regis. Very delicious which left me very full thereafter. On a side note, service could have been better given it's a five star hotel. Though staffs were friendly, they seemed uncertain in handling guest request like recommending wines etc. Still, ambience was nice with the live piano near my table
4
Let me first say "Remarkable!". And food was specially prepared for the Restaurant Week 2016 and every dish was a yelping "ooooh and aaaahhhhh". We ate the 4-course Luncheon so slowly and tasted our dishes with very focussed minds [sometimes we don't do that because we are way too pre-occupied :) ] Value and Quality is a lethal combination. The Spinach-Potato Soup deserved a special mention - it was packed with slow-cooked egg, creme fraiche and Avruga pearls. The soup was smooth and light. The pan-roasted Barramundi Fillet was juicy, soft and the skin was slightly chewy. By the time we got to the dessert - the Vanilla Creme Brulee, let's just say, I was smiling so much it showed how much I had been fed. Always will be a next time, and a next time and a next...time....

“Bon Appetite, you filthy American pig"Okay, the waiter didn’t literally say these words, but he absolutely said it in each and every one of his actions and inactions.My son and I arrived to the nearly empty restaurant for dinner and were promptly seated by a friendly hostess of Asian descent. She provided us with the menus, explained that there was a “semi-buffet” with purchase of an entree, and even took our drink orders. She arrived with the drinks and took our entree order that was to come from the kitchen and invited us to help ourselves to the buffet. It appeared that this wonderful lady was also our waitress.Upon approaching the buffet I found a covered serving tray that was facing toward me. I opened it and saw a large bone-in ribeye roast that was severely overcooked, gray throughout and rather disgusting to look at. Knowing that a rib roast was one of the entrees on the menu, I naturally assumed that this was a terrible culinary mistake of gargantuan proportions that had been tossed off onto the buffet for anyone to pick over. I spied a rib bone hanging off the edge and cut it from the slab of shame. As I was placing it upon my plate, I was hurriedly approached by a dark-haired extremely rude young causasian waiter who yelled at me to put it back and chided me for taking an entree that I had not ordered. I immediately lost my appetite and slinked back to my table to await my entree. After an inordinate long period of time, the rude waiter finally approached my table and plunked down the smallest entree I had ever seen, best described as a tapa: 3 medium shrimp and 3 nickel-sized scallops placed on a small smeared dollop of mashed potato. As he dropped it on the table he said, “bon appetite” in a French accent. It was only then that it became apparent that this guy was actually MY WAITER, an obviously pretentious Frenchman. With my back to the dining room, my son described to me the scene of this waiter google-eying me from the other side of the room, apparently on the alert that I might do something else to warrant more of his flagrant abuse.Slowly getting my appetite back, I realized that I was still starving after this “all-you-can eat” buffet and entree, so I went to the dessert table and found a nice collection of cakes, pies and, pastries; this was truly the only part of the meal that was worthy of being part of this “French” restaurant. I should know - I can’t even begin to enumerate the number of different Michelin-rated 1-, 2-, and 3-star rated French restaurants from around the world that I’ve enjoyed over the years. (BTW, to be clear, this joint doesn’t approach the level of a Michelin-rated restaurant). The only significant down-side of the desert table was that they had a non-functioning chocolate fountain that looked more like a cesspool. After devouring 5 different items over a long period of time I settled back to digest. It was only then that the rude waiter approached, collected the empty plates, and asked if I’d like to have tea or coffee with my dessert. I thought, "WHAT! You mean the desserts that I finished 10 minutes ago!!!” Obviously I didn’t say this, only, “No, thank you”. I waited another 20 minutes, occasionally twisting around to catch someone's eyes, hoping for the waiter to approach to offer the check. But he never came. Finally my son and I got up to leave and we approached a fella at the register to ask for the bill. It was quickly printed up and I signed off on it. The rude waiter passed by and gave his farewell.If you look at the reviews of the Singapore St. Regis, you will realize that the main reason why it gets lower scores is entirely because of this French-attitude restaurant that seemingly takes inordinate pleasure in ignoring and/or abusing it's dwindling clientele. Starwood would be best served by rejecting this pretentious entity of disgusting culinary fare from it’s dining options and embrace a more encompassing dining experience that doesn’t drive people away in droves

The dinner experience is great with wonderful staff especially Alvin, attentive to our needs. The seafood platter was great, it states in the menu for 2 pax but we feels it's enough for more than 2 pax. Wonderful experience. My main course was Wagyu Beef, nicely cook and really nice even i am very full. Nice experience with the restaurant. Will go back again

The ambience did not fail. Food quality for its price and hotel stars does not match, not worth it. We had dinner here, if you need a cozy corner for two you can ask for it when you reserve. They promised me a private corner for my family but did not give us the place when we arrived, such a disappointment. I think this place is better for a high tea to enjoy the floor to ceiling glass panels the bright ambience. They give free cake for a birthday celebration
5
Had breakfast here during my staycation over the weekend. The ambiance was excellent, with luxurious furnishings and great F&B service(Attentive to our needs). The food range was just right, but could have more variety for food. Might need to think of solutions to overcrowding. Had to wait for awhile and was lucky enough to get a seat. Others were told to go LaBrezza which is on the 2nd level, but the ambiance will be totally different
5
Ate in as tired after long travel. Really good food, with fine service. Best pork chop that I can remember
4
Had managed to have breakfast and lunch during my stay. The food quality and selection is top notch. Everything you can wish for at breakfast and a buffet lunch. A little on the pricey side but good value if included in your hotel stay packag

I have been to the Brasserie Les Saveurs many times and have been a Supper Club member for two years as there were promises that they'd improve their "service" (non existent) so all would be well.My experience is from Sunday afternoon teas and Sunday brunches in particular, including today's brunch.Waiters pass by without a clue what they are doing. "Still or Sparking" is served and then topped up with iced tap water. Plates are taken away and not replaced. Cutlery is removed and no suitable cutlery given for appropriate dishes.Today's brunch was the usual fiasco despite saying to them that I was attending possibly for the last time to use my membership up. More promises were made.Free-flow is anything but as they simply haven't got a clue: do they mean it is on demand and not ad hoc? We asked twice and waited ages both times for a finger bowl to arrive. The young waiter asked a senior waiter and arrived with boiling hot water in a bowl with lemon. All fingers were scolded.The idea of this brunch is that the chef sends out three scrummy hors d'oeurvres, you order your main course and three scrummy deserts arrive; the buffet is available the whole time. What actually happens is that they serve one glass of fizz and ignore you. When you ask for a glass of wine, you get just that unless you ask for another. The starters come out very slowly; one of the first ones came and was offered to a gentleman on our table of four (two men and two ladies). Wouldn't it have been 5* to bring four and offer the ladies first? So not 5*. We wait for the other starters which took most of the brunch time to arrive.As soon as we ordered the main course, the chief's puddings started arriving; despite clearly waiting for our main course and then despite having our main course sitting in front of us; we had to turn them away. When they eventually realized, the waiter promised to save them for us. They didn't reappear.All the food was delicious but cold. I even asked for freshly cooked dishes from the live station; the server simply waited a while and brought over a pile of them which had been sitting on the counter for ages. "Cooked to order" on the menu springs to mind but didn't happen.Then they are so disillusioned to ask if we had a great time. St Regis: when someone says your service is bad and not worth returning for, don't greet your customer and say everything will be wonderful and ignore that table along with everyone else.Enough's enough. I can't find a way to write to you via your website so I have resorted to trip advisor

The food was fine. A little overpriced but the quality was acceptable. What wasn't acceptable were the staff. Slow. Forgetful. Walking around in a daze. Leaving plates. Forgetting orders. Getting the bill wrong. All in all, the service has made dinner pretty poor.

I'd always wanted to give the St Regis a go for a family (with visiting MIL) Xmas Day Brunch after having a wonderful lunch in Brasserie Les Saveurs in the past. So, when I managed to land a reservation, I was pretty excited. We arrived for our pre-lunch cocktails in the martini bar but there were no seats left and we had to awkardly hover about till lunch was called at 12pm. Have to say, the Bloody Mary was bloody fabulous, though.Our table was wonderful, in a little nook and it's a beautiful room- the art deco features are lovely.The staff were friendly and attentive - at no time were our glasses empty of the delicious bubbles on free-flow.But the food..........I realise I've been spoilt by the Grand Hyatt and Pan Pacific brunches and this is such a first-world whine, but I thought the buffet would have been a bit more special. The seafood, in particular was disappoining. The scallops were not cleaned and pulling scallop frill and poo from your teeth is just plain nasty. And the oysters were un-named and unpleasantly strong tasting. Loads of fruit but no decent cheeses. And the a la carte item I chose had obviously spent waaaaay too much time on a warming bench- dried out sea-bass and cricketball gnocchi. The carvery, though was just fine. And the desserts and festive cakes were pretty and delicious.The MIL had a fab time, but those of us used to other Singapore brunches were left feeling vaguely disappointed by it all.Reckon we'll do a home xmas next year ......if we spent half as much $$ on that as we did on this brunch, we'd still be eating and drinking well
2
Head staff helpful and attentive, but most of the other waiters could not speak English and hovered the whole time to remove every plate the moment you took your last mouthful. Same selection every day. Long wait on occasion for tea (which was often tepid, not hot). Marmalade conspicuous by its absence. Buffet food warm but not hot, so better to ask for freshly cooked omlette

This place makes up for the bad NYE dinner experience we had. Great ambience, exceptional service, and the food was beyond wonderful.What a great way to start off the year. Thank you Jessa for taking care of us.St. Regis you're forgiven

We just had our Christmas Day Dinner in this restaurant and it made our Christmas a Wonderful one! Ambience was perfectly beautiful and astonishing. Service was Excellent, all were attentive and extremely friendly. Food was Great,.. although the spread was quite limited so it was a bit disappointing for this part. Was looking for more Christmas menu and desserts. And there was even Santa Claus, Carolers, and Band playing during the night, although would have been better if they relate more with the people. It's quite pricey though, but it's worth it for the great experience we had on this special occasion. :

We had Saturday lunch here recently and had the half buffet option which offers a starter and dessert buffet, plus lets you choose a main course from the menu for S$54++. Our main course was 2 thin slices of Angus beef striploin, which tasted fine but was a bit meager in portion. The starters ranged from sushi to breads, soup, cold cuts and salad. The sushi didn't taste particularly good but the cucumber gazpacho was worse (and really should be removed from the menu unless they can improve the recipe.) The dessert buffet saved the day with a satisfactory variety of tasting portions of crumbles, mousses, log cake, stollen, fruit and a chocolate fountain. There was also a small selection of cheeses. Plus points: the friendly service, cosy ambience, and the dining room with a view of the pool, all of which brightened what was an otherwise mundane buffet experience

great food great selection of wine and great service especially by Sophie who will great you warmly when you arriv

Opting out of the buffet dinner option I decided to choose from the a la carte menu. The ambience and location is great and it's an added bonus that there is a pianist playing classics from The Carpenters to Elton John. However the waiting time for the lobster bisque ($28) was definitely on the slow side. After roughly 35 minutes, the bisque finally arrived but the bread that came with it (served earlier) had already turned cold. The bisque was mediocre and could do with some salt. I disregarded the "okay" soup and hoped that the main would be much better. Most of the disappointment was from the Truffle Ravioli ($34). When having any Truffle dish ,one would definitely notice the distinct smell of the truffle. Sadly, this one only was redolent.The taste was there but it was not good enough to pull through. The food I had,had deterred me from ordering any dessert. For a restaurant in St. Regis(six star hotel), my dinner was definitely a disappointment

We experienced both Breakfast and Dinner in this Restaurant and can only describe it as first class in every way. The room itself, is absolutely beautiful and the staff and service, was outstanding
3
Atmosphere is good.Coffee is great. Had 2 cupsWent there during the breakfast buffet at about 9am+, some food are cold but it's due to the time we went.Egg section is excellent, apparently the most popular choice.Service is great, staff is friendl
4
All in all, the biggest gauge for me about a restaurant is if I would come back. And my wife and I concluded that if we felt like a nice helping of french themed cuisine, we would definitely come back.Is it pricey ? Yes, but you are going to a St Regis, so don't be surprised. Was the food quality up to par ? Yes, everything we had was terrific ... a few things needed seasoning, but that's a personal preference.Service ? Very good, no complaints.One last thing ... while the restaurant is really nice, its not something I would consider a romantic restaurant because at the end of the day, its the hotel lobby restaurant. Its the same place people have buffet breakfast, etc. So, go on a date, sure, enjoy ... but its not a destination restaurant where you would take someone on the first date to impress them.All in all, we enjoyed the visit and will return

The restaurant is at the St Regis Singapore. If you are not looking to eat a lot, the appetiser/dessert buffet is for you. The selection of appetizers is quite extensive - salads, sushi, soups and a selection of breads. The desserts are great too - fresh fruits, great cakes, a chocolate fountain and a selection of cheeses. A must try

I came here with high expectation but left with deep disappointment. This is the most expensive high tea I had in Singapore. I am fine with the price if it shows the same quality with the $$ I paid.Let's start with environment. This is definitely superb, 5 stars for the dining environment, luxury, well decorated. It looks so grand to dine here. The only complaint was my chair. I did not feel safe as I can feel it is shaking and unstable. so I have to kind of sittServices of the staffs are generally fine. So far I did got my attention from them.There are few portions of high tea section.The 3 tiers - 1st tier is the sweet stuff which is quite good. Creme Brulee is very nice and refreshing. 2nd tier is some tart and pastry which I generally feel the standard is not there. Tart skin is hard. 3rd tier is assorted sandwiches. Another disappointment as the bread is hard at the edges, it doesn't taste fresh. May be it exposed to air for too long.The buffet line:-1. Japanese corner - the sushi is totally failed, rice is hard and that shouldn't happen in this kind of standard. Smoked salmon is nice.2. The French pastry - failed because the pastry is soft and soggy. I love french pastry a lot so very disappointed with the quality3. The scones - 6 type of scones but I can only try 2 of them, nice for me and the jam is good. Thumb up for that4. The hot corner - crepe with cheese and tomatoes is good. I love that5. Assorted desserts area - suppose to be my favorite session but sad that out of the so many desserts I only found 2-3 are nice. What's wrong with me? i am looking forward to a matcha opera cake(not sure the name), it suppose to taste really good but not sure why it is way too sweet for me, I am like having a teaspoon of sugar. some mousse in cup is nice. Cheesecake is very standard, nothing to shout out.6. Bread Pudding - i personally prefer softer version, but the version here like over-baked.7. Cheese area - i like the variety cheese they serveOverall, i feel for the standard, i am expecting a better high tea. side note, there suppose to have live dance on Saturday and I did not see any. No more live dance

Went there and had the ala carte lunch for a business meeting. Had the Duck foie gras for starters; was just very average.Most disappointing was the Roasted Black Angus Beef Striploin which was supposed to be served from their classic carving trolley. To my surprise, there was no sign of any trolley when the waiter came with a piece of steak which seems to have been grilled. I asked if it was roasted or char-grilled. He explained that it was roasted and then char-grilled for different degrees of 'doneness' . Actually nobody asked how I wanted the steak to be done when I placed the order. As I was a guest at a business lunch, I did not want to kick up a fuss. The steak was a tad dry and a bit tough but not bad enough to make me want to send it back to the kitchen.Based on this experience, it is not a place which I will be in a hurry to return
5
Visited les saveurs for the first time and me and my wife had a delightful evening dining there. We were greeted and served warmly by Louie. He explained to us in detail the different premium steaks they have in their menu and gave us recommendation to our likings. We had a delightful ribeye and wagyu sirloin . He recommend us a Caesar salad as a starter and it really complimented our mains.Throughout our meal, Louie came and check on us constantly to see if everything is alright diligently . Lastly we had the creme anglaise tart through Louie's recommendation even though we are already very full and it was nothing short of delightful.Nice live piano music playing in the background , good food and excellent service ensures a lovely evening for me and my wife. Thank you Brasserie les saveur

I was so looking forward to this particular afternoon tea since there were some good online reviews. It all started promising, they called to confirm our reservation the night before. On the day, we were seated in a very beautiful and luxuriously decorated dinning room with comfortable setting, high ceilings with hotel pool view. The buffet spread looked very appetising with good variety. I liked the live piano music. Everything was tasteful. The service staff were attentive, the grand aster afternoon tea includes a 3 tier tea set and buffet spread with a puff pastry soup bowl. Everything looked set to be a great afternoon.I was impressed with the variety of scones: pesto, cranberries, st regis, chocolate, orange. But, they were cold and doughy. Not what i would expect for hotel standard. I had to spread extra clotted cream and cranberries jam to wash down the scones. They also had all kinds of puffs: vegetables, mushroom, chicken, tuna etc. again, these were cold and puff pastries were not flaky or crispy and were not appetising. Not what i would expect from a french restaurant either.I thought it was good that they had a variety of savoury items to balance the sweet items. I did like the smoked salmon with dill and capers, parma ham but these didnt need to be cooked...there were also a few types of sushi and they were actually quite nice. The eclairs and the orange custard on the 3 tiers set were the better items. The mushroom tarts were again cold and tasteless. The cream from the cream puffs were watery. Sandwiches were not impressive and i thought the bread was also abit dry. The puff pastry lobster and potatoes soup sounded nice but i was distracted by the potatoes. It tasted like powdered potatoes and didnt feel like the real potatoes which would have some rougher texture. The cheeseboard was a good idea esp with parma ham and the gelato was nice, i enjoyed the vanilla bean. However, at this point, i was already not very into the rest of the dessert section at the buffet. I did try the strawberry shortcake and it was not too bad.Overall, some hits and misses, it was quite disappointing that the food that make afternoon tea were not as good and impressive as they should be. Given the price, i would not return

Food is just sensational ! with a great service ! we had a very nice romantic evening. ideal for an anniversary, or a date ! very good fine dining

My wife and I visited the restaurant for High Tea recently and left extremely disappointed with the outcome. It started badly when the restaurant could not find my reservation despite me having received a confirmation email form them which I had to produce in order for them to seat us.The venue lacked the ambience that would be expected. Whilst there was a piano music it seemed that the pianist took his break virtually as we settled in and then didn't return for more time than I would consider reasonable. There was no discernible background music in the interim.The food selection was average at best but the coup de grace was the expected hot food was not hot. And as a purist the scone selection was an insult to the tradition. Make all the fancy desserts you like but don't muck up the scones please.I ordered English Breakfast tea as I like strong tea however the large tea pot had a single tea bag. No attention to detail or understanding of the customer expectation.The managers hovered annoyingly and then one tried to interest us in Starwood Benefits program and another tried to get us to fill in a survey on an IPad before we left. Plenty of better experiences to be had in Singapore so this was definitely a once off visit

Made a reservation for two in Les Saveurs for high tea. You get a 3 tier cake stand with tea sandwiches, quiche, mini eclairs and tartlets and a pot of tea. You also get a buffet included with sushi, bountiful deserts, cheese options, chocolate fountain, bread a butter pudding, sorbets, crepe station etc.It all was well presented but the overall experience was let down by the following points:1.service was spotty and there were long periods where dirty plates were left on the table and tea pots remained empty. ( It was not busy so thats not a reason)2. Plates- No side plates provided for eating the quiches, sandwiches etc. Dinner plates available on the buffet but you had to go and get those every time.3. Limited cutlery- you get a basic knife fork & spoon but no offer to change during the meal, no cake forks, desert spoons, you have to hunt around for them at the buffet.4. Savoury selection was very limited, the only sandwiches were on the 3 tier stand and only 3 tiny sandwiches per person. Yes there were curry puffs etc but this is high tea not Old Chang Kee Bakery!5. The desert options were average- higlights were the berry tartlets. It was $57++pp, which would have been ok if quality and service was there but alas no.I preferred the Shangri La high tea

Service: 4/5Prompt and fast service. Friendly staffs.Atmosphere: 4.5/5Nice seating arrangements for couples or small groups. Quiet and cozy atmosphere.Food: 4/5We had the semi-buffet for lunch. The black angus beef striploin came out a little "dry". Tiger prawns was quite good. Else, the rest of the buffet was great. Good selection of cheese at the tray.Overall: 4.5/5Perhaps we will try another main instead of the steak the next time round

I was staying at the St. Regis for a business trip, but I had my wife with me, and we decided to try out the Sunday brunch buffet. The food and service was all absolutely incredible. Although it is expensive, it definitely delivers on value and food quality. It is a great place for those special moments in life
2
This is the St Regis' flagship restaurant, and seeks to offer a classic French cuisine experience, including fine-dining ambiance, extensive wine menu and expensive prices to match. So it sets itself a high bar...and so warrants judgement on that basis as such. The good points. The beautiful decor, live piano and general 'luxury' feeling of the place certainly set a great ambiance of something special is about to happen. We took one of the private booths just located behind the cashier's desk, which is a nice option for those seeking the romantic evening or quiet business dinner. Sadly, that's where the good points ended. The cuisine while acceptable was nothing special. The white asparagus special lacked any special taste, the French onion soup was watery and needed additional salt/pepper to liven it up. The roast beef carved at your table was perfectly fine and certainly appetising to see, but again lacked nothing really special in terms of taste. The service started off reasonably well-enough. However it then went progressively downhill. The wrong wine was brought initially to the table, resulting in the correct bottle only arriving after our 1st course had been served. Nothing wrong with delivery of the 2nd course but thereafter, the staff seemed to disappear and several seemed pre-occupied with closing up the restaurant in terms of removing buffet plates etc. In the end, I had to search for a staff member to ask them to remove our 2nd course plates.....the lady who did apologised, but all the same we decided to skip the dessert option. For this kind of price, I won't be back again for dinner

so we went there with my wife and teen boy because we really want to taste and experience this famous and highly commented champagne sunday brunch in every review found by opinion leaders in Singapore. The results was ok from the venue point of view, St Regis is well maintained and reception staff if friendly and the hotel is conveniently located and if you ask for it you will get a complimentary ticket for your car park.The originality here is that they mix food stations with pass-on dishes and with a choice of main course, so the quality of the product is not an issue, but really the big disapointment is that my main course came "cold", a beef tenderloin, come on !The same for the Seabass of my wife, the foie gras was always served in cold plates, even if the Ruinart champagne was really good. Regarding the service, those guys are not able to smile and not really welcoming (your sommelier needs to learn how to smile guys...). So globally for the price positionning of this brunch, you can expect excellence on the choices and the details and it was not the case. And finally no "soul" at all on this brasserie, conclusion, with all those "cold" facts not sure i will come back as there is in Singapore much more options for beautiful brunch options. Sorry guys but a lot of room for improvements here with your pricey position and as french we really appreciate gastronomy but this time it is a miss..
2
the staff seem to run around doing nothing, you have to stay out of their way. we waited for 20 minutes to get a tea. by then we were almost done with breakfast. we arrived 1 hour before the end of breakfast and they did not restick/refill any of the food. the selection of food that should have been available seemed like a nice selection, or i would have given this the lowest star review possible. the staff is the problem here. they dont know what service is. The service experienced would have been bad for a Sheraton Hotel, but for a St Regis, its horrible
4
Service was excellent and staff kept working and serving us water even after closing hours. It was a buffet dinner and the spread was excellent. The lamp was tender and wonderful. I usually don't take lamp because of the strong lamb smell. Dessert range was large and had ice-cream. Ambience is beautiful. Go during occasion or celebrations. Expensive but worth it.

For my husband's birthday dinner, we wanted to go French. After reading reviews from known food bloggers in Singapore, we elected to go to Brasserie Les Savours. From the seamless reservation a few days before to the actual dinner where we were attended to in the most accommodating manner, I have to say that BLS gave us one of the most memorable dining experiences. Everyone was so nice and the food was, of course, top grade. The amuse bouche we started off with was perfect! The foie gras, too, was delectable. I ordered pan-seared pork chop and my husband had lamb and they were both really good. My pork chop was cooked just right, not too soft and not too hard either, with just the right amount of flavours to tease my palate with each bite. We also ordered a platter of French cheese and I loved the bleu cheese! They gave us free birthday cake and they even sang 'joyeux anniversaire' to my husband. We thought that was pretty neat! All in all, we loved how well we were treated and taken care of last night. Brasserie Les Saveurs definitely ranks high on our list of great French restaurants on the island. Highly recommended
1
Was impressed the previous time with the food and service, so decided to go back for a business lunch, order their signature dish (sole at S$73), but turn out that the food was hastily done - sole was very small, hard and burned and potato was not cooked and all this cost S$73 for this signature dish! In additional, the service was appalling despite that there are only a few customers during lunch time. Lodged a complaint immediately but now it is the third week, still no reply despite promise of getting back to me immediately. I would not hesistant not to jump the supperclub membership because of this really bad experience. Did not lived up to expectation
3
Had dinner with another couple. Food was nice. We chose the "Connoisseur" which was great value for $73. Really liked the appetizers on the buffet but the desserts didn't quite satisfy us. You could choose from 6 main courses. However, one was not available! Asked for the wine list. Received the beverage list. When the real wine list was presented we ordered a a nice bottle of red. Sommelier was gracious. We wanted a second bottle. It was out of stock! Wish he had mentioned to us that it was the last bottle.A server dropped my friends fork and never bothered to replace it !Coffee arrived and we had to ask for cream and sugar! St. Regis didn't have cream! Well, coffee with milk then! Service was definitely flawed.With that said, the company was great, food was all right and ambience cozy. We won't hurry back, but hopefully when we do, the service will be a notch higher .... like a typical St. Regis eatery

We celebrated our wedding anniversary dinner here.The ambience is very good. The place is cosy, posh & beautiful. The music was good too. We were sitting at a table just few feet away from the lady singer & thoroughly enjoyed her beautiful songs. The mood was just great for our occasion.The food is not bad though not fantastic. Overall, it was an enjoyable evening & we loved it.It is expensive though, but worth it for a special occasion.

So after reading and reviewing all the hotel Afternoon High Tea's available in Singapore, we decided to try the one at the St Regis Hotel. I have heard about how wonderful the ambience and space is at the Brasserie Les Saveurs and so we called and made a reservation for 3pm.Arriving there the first hiccup was that they could not find our reservation. Anyway, since the restaurant was only half full we got a table and we requested to sit in the middle of the room near the window facing the pool. The room is actually quite small and the whole place did not wow us like they did on the website or from pictures we have seen. One of the problem is that the staff there are not really trained to a 5 star hotel quality standard. One Manager brought us to the table and explained the menu and the procedure to just one of the guest at our table and then walked away. Expecting my guest to repeat it to me. Next we ordered our tea and went to try out the buffet. They had some local food, sushi, scones and the usual sweet pastries and cake. Also some fruits and local favoured ice cream. I tried most of them and not one of them were good especially the St Regis scones! The three tier serving of sandwiches and savoury bites with pastries were equally not exciting. The waiter who brought it to our table did not even know all the food in the tiers and could only explain half of them! Frankly I would definitely recommend the Fullerton or Fullerton Bay View afternoon high tea over this. All this time, we had to constantly get the attention of the 4 to 5 staff who seem to be just wondering around and not taking care of the guests. It seemed like only one young waiter was really running around and attending to the guests. The other waiters seemed to be only interested to serve business guests. Overall a big let down and I would definitely not even try their Sunday Champagne brunch. There are other much better hotels in Singapore to have high tea.

Was there for my girlfriend's birthday, good ambience, nice music and songs. Food was good but not the best. Scones, tarts and pastry were well made. Desserts like cakes were mediocre though. Served with TWG tea.Pretty pricey, only worth for special occasions. Tables were a bit too close to one another, little privacy. We can literally hear the other couple's sweet talk!
3
Really nothing to write home about. Even at a St. Regis, the standard breakfast buffer can be impossibly banal
5
A great place for afternoon high tea. Cosy and posh environment. They have an impressive spread for high tea. Besides the buffet spread, each person gets a 3 tiered tray stacked with sandwiches, tarts, puffs and pudding. The crepes are made on the spot and you can choose the different fillings, try the peanut butter crepe. Simply delicious.
4
Food was quite nice, service ok. Reservation easy, table was ready on time. Nice buffet for entries. Not too expenssive. I would recommend. Decoration is nice as well

I recently held a smallish wedding here at St Regis at their in-house French styled buffet restaurant - Brasserie Les Saveurs. The wedding venue seated 80 people comfortably but could house up to 100. Grace Yong was my wedding coordinator and I simply could not have asked for a more responsive and responsible coordinator! She was quick to reply all my queries and acceded to most of my requests, including customization of the buffet menu, having my cocktail table done a certain way, drawing up my table plans at the last minute, and acceding to my last minute requests for wedding favours. The food was excellent too, as prepared by Chef Bobby and his team. During the dinner we were taken care of by Pushpinder the restaurant manager, and his team. They made sure that the groom and I were fed by bringing food to our table despite it being a buffet. The venue and choice of food was unusual for a wedding but I received numerous compliments from my guests - about how they enjoyed the elegant yet relaxed atmosphere and excellent food.Also the restaurant comes with an inhouse singer and pianist on weekends, one less thing to coordinate for brides - to- be.Just a small word for caution though, the restaurant is pretty enclosed but not entirely, sounds from your wedding can be heard beyond the venue, but I didn't quite care. As such, the restaurant will not permit loud 'yam sengs' - not a problem for me as I'm non-traditional.Thank you very much, Grace and team. We will be back to celebrate our other special occasions

I have stayed here for weeks in a row.+staff are awesome, really kind and do their best. More staff would be helpful. It is too busy and most of the time it is difficult to even get a coffee+breakfast good. White egg omelette, nutella, fruit and bread are very good+lunch and dinner so boring and average quality. Sushi rolls are so poor quality -- can you not really hire a great cheff? Not even the rice is decent. Main dishes are oily -- please hire a good chef, this is your main restaurant and this is a great hote
5
A tad late I know but better late than never to commend Mr Push and Ms Cherry on their warmth and genuine care shown towards my friends and I at our Saturday brunch. Incredibly professional and both a great asset to the St Regis/Starwood brand.

We went for their Sunday brunch. Beautiful restaurant, nice display of food. Huge variety of buffet food, dessert plus main course ordered from the kitchen.We arrived late due to an earlier engagement. Staff really helped us "make up for lost time". They brought seafood straight from the kitchen to our table when they found out it was our favourite. Our champagne glasses were always topped up. No request of ours seemed too hard for them.Chef Fabrice Passicos came out of the kitchen to greet guests towards the end. We had a really good chat with him. He was friendly, approachable and seemed genuinely enjoyed what he did for customers.An overall pleasant experience. It is on the pricy side but we did get what we paid for in terms of food, drinks and service
5
Family brunch was a unique experience! Attentive, discreet and cheerful service combined with one of the most exceptional food experiences a brunch could offer. Food display was eye catching and appealing only exceeded by the quality of the dishes. We were accompanied by our 13 month old grandson who received caring sincere attention. Live entertainment was perfect for the time of day and range in age of clients. Overall the St. Regis offers an exceptional feast with the quality justifying the cost especially with the Ruinart champagne accompaniement
1
The service is appalling. We had the chosen the breakfast package. Not at all what we expected. The head waiter tries to sum the guests he wants to give tables to one he does not prefer. We were moved 2 different venues to be seated which the atmosphere was terrible and the breakfast selection was minimal. So we demanded to be moved back to the main restaurant tofu d there's were tables. We were never offered tea and coffee at our tables never had cutlery. We were also ignored. We are SPG platinum members and if we are treated in this way we will be staying at a different brand.
5
Been there few times & each time I'm there with my husband we feel so relaxed with exquisite cuisine & excellent service. One particular service staff worth mentioning is Push, he is especially efficient & sincere towards all his guests. Two thumbs up for him.

It's my second time for Saturday Tea-dance and i love the concept so took my christmas gathering there again last weekend.Was initially disappointed at the small selection of food for tea, but the service and dance more than made up for it!! My girlfriends and i had so much fun learning to waltz around the ballroom with light, easy steps! Also, the waiters and manager was very attentive to our needs... ensuring we had enough to eat after we commented that the selection was weak, and often coming around to make sure our teas are filled and plates are cleared. Special mention to Push, the manager, who was very attentive, took good pictures for us very patiently. He even knew who to pass the complimentary car park ticket to, without us mentioning! We were very surprised at his keen observations. Needless to say, it was a fun Christmas for us and i will be bringing my friends back for gathering again!!

This is not actually a review, but simply some feedback i think you should have.My family and I had dinner at your Brassier on the evening of 21st December. The overall restaurant experience was quite good but I was shocked at the condition of the Ladies restroom on the same level.The first time I visited the restroom, around 7.15pm, i found absolutely no toilet paper in any of the cubicals. i reported this to the staff member outside the restaurant and suggested he alert housekeeping. He apologised for the oversight and immediately went off to attend to the matter.About 1 1/2 hours later I visited the restroom once again and found some paper in some cubicles, but very little. Whilst I was in a cubicle there was a loud knocking on the door, which I ignored. On exiting the cubicle I found a male attendant in the process of replacing toilet paper. I have no objection to a male servicing this area, provided it is done in an appropriate manner - his hard knocking on the door was far from appropriate.The other problem I experienced in this facility was a lack of suitable drying materials for hands - the only thing I could find was boxes of facial tissues, which are not designed for the purpose.I only visited one of your public restrooms, but, I have never experienced such a stiuation, even in less highly esteemed establishments

The food and ambience was quite good. I went there for high tea on my birthday and I would definitely go back for more. The food, especially the salmon, was great. Their staff were polite

Food was so so.. Ambience was lovely.. Went for the semi buffet.. Ordered the chicken and pork for our mains HOWEVER the staff did not check with us if we were ready for our mains and brought it out.. When we had it it was cold.. Our chicken was all mush and only found out it wasn't cooked properly after we had 3/4 of it.. told the staff but he never got back to us until we asked them about it when we paid the bill (according to the staff they could do nothing as "90% of it was eaten").. Staff tried to later then advise us that it was cool from this morning as it is slow cooked.. Honestly we know the difference between a cooked chicken and a raw chicken we have worked in kitchens before.. Pork was too sweet for a braised pork belly.. Will NEVER be coming back here agai

Was at this restaurant last month for Sunday brunch with a group of friends for a short holiday and they insisted that I write a review. The restaurant is beautiful and the ambiance is quite relaxing. Food presentation looked amazing and fresh. Chefs walk around distributing little plates of food and main courses are brought in much later. However, in terms of taste wise, it was pretty normal for me and my friends. Overall a good service experience but not one that excites the taste buds

On reflection,we're now glad that Raffles Hotel were fully booked for the legendary Singapore Sunday Brunch,so we arrived here,and were comfortable from the start with the not over-large size,the variety of food on offer,and the ambience at 1.30pm on our final day in the city following a Far Eastern cruise.Great choice of sea food,incuding scallops,lobster and prawn,and even Russian caviar on blinis.Free flowing wines depending on dining option,the standard roast beef and lots more,so though eating our fill,we declined the chef cooked main course with 5 or 6 choices. Replete and happy.ably looked after by a lovely local waitress, Siti, we'd recommend to all as a fine way to spend a 'Lazy Sunday Afternoon

Well, it is a beautiful place. The room is fantastic, and the spread looks fabulous - I just wish it was all as tasty and clean as it looked.So what is good?- the looks and style- the smoked salmon- the sushi- the cheeses- some of the desertsWhat was not good?- the lobster pie thing was all potato and pastry- the sandwiches were nothing special at all, tasted almost like sweet bread, and the fillings were disappointing, especially the egg mayonnaise - the scones were dry and could have been leftovers from the previous day- there was a snail shell from someone's lunchtime brunch under one of the chairs- no soft drinks if you don't drink tea, which seems incredibly cheap, and puts a complete downer on going with kids- rather than replace your tea pot they just refill with water and leave you with weak teaSo, looks great, but you get a big bill and could be left with some extras you hadn't expected

I bring my wife and my kids for the first time at Brasserie les Saveurs for sunday brunch. I will say this brunch at the st regis is a best in town. Great food with beautiful buffet, pass around food, choices of main course. The taste and the presentation are really good. We choose to go with a free flow of champagne, the beverage selection is great with a choice of different type of white, red, port, trolley where you can make your own bloody mary and of course champagne. The staff are very friendly, a good athmosphere in the restaurant with a great band. We will definitely come back

After a long day on Saturday at Shopping at Orchard Rd, we decided go for dinner at St Regis to try the French cuisine at brasserie les saveurs. The main reason we wanted to go over there because we get to know that there is dinner and dance every Saturday that no other hotel restaurant are doing this at all, so we went to try out. It's turn as awesome dinner and great service with excellent food. We try the signature dish prime rib, the server push over the carving trolley to us and portion the meat in front of us it's one of unusual things that other restaurant rarely do this table service. I really enjoy the ambience with wonderful fountain and lighting together with nice singer. I will definitely will return back and will recommend to all my friends.

I attended the Sunday Brunch at Brasserie Les Savuers, yesterday Sunday 16th November. It is probably my 6th or 7th visit to have brunch at the St Regis, it may well be my last. I am also into my second year as a member of the Supper Club, this will also be my last year of membership.I should have realised that something was wrong with the poor service presented in the Astor Bar before lunch, 20 minutes to get a drink.This poor service continued thru to the dining room and on till the end of the meal at 3pm.Eggs Benedict took 20 minutes to arrive, was stone cold, and came served on the toughest bread muffin I have ever tried to eat. I watched a gentleman on an adjacent table struggle with his some time later, so mine was not a ‘one off ’.Both mine and my wife’s A La Carte meals took some 40 minutes to arrive, and they too were ice cold. I find it hard to believe that they would leave the kitchen like this, and the food must have been left to go cold by the poorly trained waiting staff.I complained to the waiters on both occasions, yet not one person from the kitchen came to my table. Nor did any manager in the restaurant, and there are 3 or 4 of them hanging around the entrance, come to ask what was wrong.Your service in this restaurant is nothing short of a disgrace, how you can consider yourself at the top end of fine dining is beyond me. The buffet is non descript and boring, and although I can eat poor food, I cannot eat poor, cold food.St Regis is surrounded by top quality hotels, providing top quality service. I have noticed the standard of service decline on my last 2 visits to your hotel. You need to seriously look at the standard of staff you are employing , and the training that they are given, as they do not provide the level of service I expect from a supposedly 5 star hotel. I will not return to this restaurant again.Bernard O'Sulliva

We enjoyed a special Epicurean lunch experience at the very French Brasserie Les Saveurs in a neat little private alcove. Great atmosphere

Place is beautifully set up as one would expect of the St Regis. Singer was good .First off waiter gave us the wrong information regarding the menu . Restaurant week menus were slightly different from the regular menu and his explanations left us confused .Staff were ok the initial set up, but thereafter service was poor . Plates weren't cleared , water /wine was not topped up, cutlery had to be requested for, complimentary parking tickets forgotten etcMain courses which were served at the table were fine . Presented well and tasty . The vegetable and beef entree were delicious . Food at the buffet table was slow to replenish . Actually some never saw the daylight after the tray got taken in for "top up". There wasn't a crowd , yet the staff appeared to have a hard time in getting their act together . When brought to the attention of floor manager , he just mentioned he would " bring it to the attention of higher management " but there was no attempt to do customer recovery.Definitely embarrassing service standards / restaurant management for an establishment associated with the St Regis branding .Would not return.

First time in Brasserie Les Saveurs with my wife. I wanted to order a-la-carte but the buffet was so appealing that I chose it. The place is very nice and the service was exceptional (thanks Sharan!). I will come back.The only suggestion I would make is that such restaurant should ask its customers to be dressed properly. Someone in short wearing Crocs should not be allowed to have dinner there

I'll take a moment to review this restaurant separately from my hotel review of the St. Regis, and this review is only for the breakfast buffet. On our first breakfast, we were seated and served without ever having been offered a menu, which we noticed other people had used AFTER we were done eating. Not sure how that happened. Lattes were available at no extra charge and the first ones were served with reasonable dispatch. The service was slow: it was not easy to submit latte re-orders, or to even get water at times. Most of the food is buffet (especially when you don't have a menu!), so you serve yourself. Most staff members are in white coats, black ties; it seemed quite formal. But the service was haphazard and lacking any sense of order. Most of the tourists, like us, are dressed in shorts and t-shirts or similar. Nearing the end of the breakfast service, it felt like the staff couldn't wait to clear away food and clean up the place after three hours of dining had passed. Oh, NOW you're attending to the tables! The place didn't seem very relaxed or welcoming, and overall the place just had an odd atmosphere about it. The food quality was fair, but we'd had better breakfast buffets in other hotels.
4
BLS's servicescape was exceptional! The lighting and music played were soothing, service was great and the restaurant was really spacious. We felt really comfortable and truly enjoyed our afternoon tea there
2
The ambient was good to its position at well known The St RegisBut the food was far from good. Maybe I can cook better than thisIt will be my first and last..
5
Went for the afternoon tea and had a really good time, with the staff being exceptionally polite and attending to all our requests! Highly recommended as there was a wide range of food and drink of good qualit
5
Les Saveurs has been my go-to for high tea for the year now!The high tea buffet comes with a three tiered savoury platter and dessert buffet spread of scones, jams, cheeses, pastry and crepes and ice cream. The spread ranks one of the nicest I've tasted from most other high tea places of the same price range and very value for money. The ambience and decor are extremely pleasing and tasteful, and has been effective for both business and personal engagements for me thus far. Their service on numerous occasions however, still lacks attention to detail and quality. One any number of occasions, my reservation would either be missing from the system, or the birthday surprise that I requested for our party was promptly forgotten. I hope this lack of service rigour does not impede future visits

Being an avid foodie and having eaten at top tables across Europe, Ireland, the UK and Singapore over the last several years, my husband and I were really looking forward to our meal at Brasserie Les Saveurs when friends decided to take us to celebrate his birthday. Although heralded as one of Singapore's top 10 to eat at, our ala carte dinner was a disastrous affair which made us feel no one was paying any attention to the food coming out of the kitchen. While my foie gras starter was uneventful n lacking in flavor as was our hosts, the real tragedy came when the lobster my husband was looking so forward to, was not only miniscule on a bed of lacklustre rice but also chewy and full of cartilage and shell - totally unacceptable for the price and a restaurant of this calibre. To the managing staff's credit, when we gave feedback, the sous chef and later the head chef came to our table to apologize and agreed this shouldn't have happened offering us desserts on the house to make up, which we accepted. Two on the table ordered the chocolate lava cake thinking they had at least that to look forward to but they both arrived frozen, cutting into it there was no expected chocolate flow or even a hint of moisture! I make chocolate fondants on a regular basis and it's definitely not rocket science just requires some focus. This resulted in the manager being called again, who agreed our desserts were nowhere near molten lava and told us he was really sorry but the kitchen staff had left earlier so there had been no one to cook the desserts properly- this despite being told they would make up for the disastrous dinner with the desserts! Needless to say, when we shared our experience with other friends , they shared similar stories of disappointment leading us to only one conclusion - avoid at all costs if you're used to good French cooking

I went to st Regis on Tuesday and your waiter named sharan and manager named push served me. I Had prime rib and it tasted so good . The beef was made to my satisfaction. What that make me more satisfied is the service given by these two staffs. They were polite and attended to my request whenever I need. I greatly thank them for their great guest service. After long day at work, they make my day. The ambience was excellent too. Good job st Regis
3
This is a very elegant restaurant! It has beautiful high ceiling, the live piano music was lovely and the ambient was good. Unfortunately, the service was not on par with its 5 star hardware. The service staff seemed to lack the expected attentiveness and service aptitude. Our water and wine glass were constantly left emptied. Some of the service staff were quite abrupt and did not seems to be probably trained. Few dishes at the buffet spread was left completely empty at time and it ran out of soup bowls quite a few times. However, one Cherry was the exception who demonstrated excellent service that was expected from this elegant restaurant. Dishes were made from high quality ingredients and the overall food standard was acceptable. All in all, it was a pretty disjointed dining experience
4
The food was not too bad. Cherie's service was excellent and it was great to see people dancing and hear live singing

St. Regis is truly a opulent hotel and Brasserie Les Saveurs in terms of decor, ceiling, ambience was 100%. We went for the St Regis Connoisseur Seafood Dinner, you have a selection of main course you could order and appetisers and desserts are generally free flow. It was my companion's birthday and a cake was provided(which they took away for us.). For thursdays, there is also a live band(please check), and the lead singer sang a birthday song for my companion, absolutely mind blowing.Okays but some minor issues to make a perfect experience.1) the mains took quite a while to come, almost an hour? but its good as it allowed us to enjoy the appetisers and chat a little. However, the mains(both the strip loin and the lamb) were quite forgettable, for the price I paid, I think we should be able to select anything on the menu instead of just the 6 or so selections. 2) Steak was ordered well done, but came medium rare, but we had quite a lot of the appetisers so we didn't really return it. 3) Service by Terry(our wait staff assigned to our table) was new but fantastic but we didn't like that when we hollered for someone else, they would "please hold" and call terry which takes a while as he could be with someone else
5
It's probably not the best breakfast I have had but certainly the most decadent, really lovely with a nice seafood sauce over it. It was on the menu in the breakfast buffet. As we were staying in the hotel and breakfast was included not sure of price.We also went there for a meal the night before and had a la carte. They had a girl singing and piano playing, the atmosphere was excellent. As I was not too hungry I had snails and asparagus and my husband had the fish entree, delicious and the stuffed chicken roulade, just lovely And very filling. Aussie red wine was $98 bottle, meal cost was around $200 total. Service was excellent, and the decor is just beautiful with very decorated ceiling , huge chandeliers and looking out to a pool area with coloured lights lighting the fountains of water. Overall a lovely experience by day or night. Would definitely recommen
3
We waited 45 mins and ordered thrice before our coffee came.The steak was not well done to my request
4
I would like to say that the service is really the STAR of Brasserie Les Saveurs!!! If you are one who feels that the prices there is too high, take the plunge! coz you'll be so pampered! Special mention to Push!! He was a darling!!! We were there to celebrate one of our friends birthday, and he took special note of my birthday request when we made reservation for tea today, and prepared a lovely cake, tea dance and song for the birthday girl!!! THIS IS WHAT I CALL STAR STAR STAR SERVICE!!! If only everywhere in Singapore has this excellent service!!! WELL DONE PUSH!!!On a side note, the food served for tea was rather extensive, more towards the english tea style.. And OMG, we loved the carrot soup!!! Not only was it served warm (there are so many places which serves room temperature soups these days), but it was also so YUMMY!!! there was a wide selection of scones to choose from, and the jams... we were simply spoilt for choice... But if you were to ask me if there were any misses, yup, there were... I would say that the sandwiches served were a little bland, and the bread too thick and dry... The puff pastry on the chicken pot pie seemed a little undercooked (but the chicken and mushroom within was HEAVEN!!). Ambience wise, it was just perfect for the 5 of us to chill and relax... But I would still like to emphasis on one thing... SERVICE... this was the creme de la creme! And Push was the icing of it all... For that service, we would definitely be back soon!!! Keep it up Push!!! Spread the love with everyone!!! (But I know that he definitely would spread to all the guests there!!!) P.S. For Push's boss, he's a keeper!!! :
5
The selection of the food is really nice and very tasty. The restaurant set up is amazing. They have this pass around canape and btw 11am -12 pm they have unlimited cocktails selection. The bloody mary is awesome. The Sunday brunch is really a killer

good french restaurant at the St. regis ... nice buffet ... good a la carte menu, wines a bit too pricy, even by singapore standard

Saturday High Tea at St Regis Brasserie Les Saveurs is always a highlight of my weekends. I recently joined the Supper Club and enjoyed the privileges as a club member with 25% discount off the dining bill. The ballroom dancing with dance instructors is a great idea. What better way to relax and have high tea with friends with nostalgic all time favourites music! Those who do ballroom dancing can enjoy the dance with the instructors, even tourists or diners who don't dance enjoy learning some new steps with the friendly instructors. They make a merry atmosphere, bringing back the tea dance of the past.. I can see the rest of the diners equally enjoy the music and songs sang by the lovely and friendly singer as well as watching people dance, what entertainment!. How I wish there are other days of ballroom dancing besides Saturday. I am sure it will attract many diners who enjoy this as much I do.The service staff especially Miss Yolanda Wee is commendable. She personally look after us knowing we are regulars there every Saturday. She makes our reservations and make sure we are comfortable and attended to our every needs. My sincere thanks to the lovely and attentive young lady. Also many thanks to the assistant manager Mr Alvin Tan who is helpful and accommodative.The only setback of this High Tea is the food. I must say the selection and standard of the food is at most average. With a price tag of $58++ I am sure the hotel can do better

On several occasions we have greatly enjoyed the champagne Sunday lunch at the St Regis Brasserie. Alas not this time. The service was absolutely terrible. Twice we had to personally clear dishes from the table, cutlery was not replaced, free-flow champagne had to be requested and no- one bothered to take our main course order. Staff (both waiters and chefs) were literally often standing around chatting. I ordered eggs benedict and asked twice where it was - after 25 mins it was delivered cold, very poorly cooked-one mouthful and set aside. Even the pot of tea was cold. The side dishes brought to the table were mediocre and the main course took 40 mins and arrived after we had commenced desert. Compared to other Sunday brunches in Singapore, the buffet selection was sub par. At over $400 for two people this is not acceptable. Having lived in Singapore for over 20 years I wld suggest that likes of the Ritz Carlton, the Hyatt and the Fullerton offer far better value for Sunday brunch
5
It was my first time to try a high tea buffet and it became more memorable when I had it in Brasserie Les Saveurs. Pastries,cakes, sweets ,icrecream and sushis and nice brewed Teas are heavenly. The service are execellent. The waiters frequently ask us if the food is fine and kept us reminding to try some of the pies and fruits as well. The ambience of the restaurant is elegant and cozy. I'll definitely come back again and try their buffet dinner as well.
5
First visit to this restaurant on Sunday evening. We ran late but staff held our table after notification. Beautiful booth table and service by Yolanda, Alvin and staff were all excellent. They were attentive to our needs and timed our entree according to our pace. We will definitely return for future meals. J Chan

The evening dinner buffet is unique in that it includes a salad bar with at least 30 different items ranging from salads, to cheese to meats. There is also hot soup and a wide variety of deserts. Then you choose an entree from the menu and there are about 10 dishes to choose from, ranging from fish to chicken to pork belly and prime rib. I chose the prime rib, which came out on a cart and was served table-side. The beef was grass fed beef from New Zealand (if I recall correctly) and it was done perfectly and had great flavor. The wines available by the glass were very good and the service was excellent. The dining room has soaring ceilings and there's an entertaining fountain display which can be enjoyed when sitting at a table near the windows

Okay, it was Saturday lunch, but I opted not to have the buffet because it's quite limited. Looks reasonable quality, but very limited compared to other hotels (small dining room). A la carte should be better..... or so I thought....Started with french onion soup, one of my favourites. Well, I can only say "very watery and lacking in taste". I would be ashamed to serve that.Next, stuffed quail. Equally bland and tasteless.As someone who comes from europe and knows what these dishes should taste like, I was extremely disappointed. I wish I had taken the limited buffet, I would have enjoyed it more. Not enjoyed it, just more. Its all relative.My wife had the buffet, she was more pleased than me.... but she was not very satisfied....I can understand.Bottom line: the only thing of interest in the eclectic decor, mostly art deco with some grunge thrown in. Nothing else of interest.Avoid. Simple logic: if a la carte is crap, what hope do you have,,,,,,

 It was third time having Mother's Day lunch at this restaurant. Our table got very cold aircon wind and food got cold quickly. I couldn't stand to stay at table and went outside sometimes to get warm... We asked them aircon temperature down. They did just few minutes before we left. We even didn't get main dish because we couldn't stay. They didn't apologise.... I always get sweets box for the Mother's Day gift but not this year... Food get worse every year and service is very bad. We never go back again

Its for the first time i'm Posting something in Trip adviser. I'm so glad to write about Brasserie Les Saveurs. According to me It's the finest restaurant in Singapore. Great atmosphere, good food and impeccable service.I'm so overwhelmed by their hospitality. I had my dinner there, it was one of the busiest days but still the restaurants was well organised and managed. I was very keen to meet the restaurant manager, though he was busy he took the patience to meet me. I really appreciate your hospitality Mr. Biju. I wish all the very best to you and your entire team
5
I had my best dining experience in Brasseri les Saveurs. Their customer service is extraordinary and the full credit goes to the manager, he is superb. I'm looking forward to meet you guyz real soon

I visited this used to be great restaurant back in late December for brunch. I understand this review is quite late on but I think other diners do need to be made aware of what went on in the restaurant. The first time I visited which was probably last year mid June or July it was fantastic and flawless. The food was superb as well as the service, the tables were spaced out very nicely that made us feel like we were in our own little private space. However, when we visited in December everything seemed very different. The number of tables seemed to have gone up to accommodate more guests for the festive period. At the table the champagne glasses had not been polished properly and there were even different sized champagne glasses at the same table. The eye for detail clearly went missing that day.The food as well was very disappointing. There was a great variety of seafood etc however it seemed to be extremely lacking in quality. The sashimi didn't seem to be cut right and the lobsters were tasteless. Not quite sure what went wrong that day. Overall, the service was nowhere near as good as it was the previous time we visited. It felt like a number of part timers had been employed just for the festive season. After that experience I'm still in two minds whether I would head there again
3
First, the restaurant's reservation system was flawed. It did not have the record of my reservation, which I made a day earlier online. So it started with an embarrassment!Lunch is an international buffet with a hotch-potch of everything from Chinese dim sums and noodles, to Japanese sushis, and some Western dishes. So, despite the name, there is nothing French about this joint. Though there were a lot of items to choose from, none impressed as far as taste went. Chinese dim sums and noodles did not fare better than those in cheap foodcourts. Japanese sushis were not fresh, tasted like those one bought from the supermarkets. Roast beef and poached fish were overcooked. For a 6-star hotel restaurant, the food quality is very poor indeed. Not recommended
1
Booked for a table of 4 for afternoon tea in the lobby lounge of St Regis. Lobby is very nice & we had a lovely twin sofa table…..but…..once the food arrived everything started to go down hill. Sandwiches were stale & very poor quality, we sent everything back. The small quiches also on the display stand went back for the same reason. Unfortunately the staff seem ill equipped to handle problems and the whole experience ended up being very disappointing. Had to get new cutlery from nearby table whilst 3 staff looked on joking, same for new tea cups, ran out of scones almost immediately, asked for more & just left dangling as the same staff also continued to walk around ignoring most of the guests. Tried to charge us for hot water to top up existing tea pot etc……just not what I had expected on comparison to many other afternoon teas in Singapore (Grand Hyatt & The Regent Hotel are the same price and significantly better)
4
We had breakfast here as we were staying at the hotel, and it's quite nice. I'm not sure what it'd be like with a full house, but when we were there, it was nicely filled - not too busy, not dead either.The service is prompt and friendly - the food is what you would expect from a hotel of this calibre. Everything is nicely packed in little portion controlled glass wear - although I believe berries should be served by the bucket load!! the a la carte menu is a nice touch - reminded me of HK Sheraton Towers. The waffles are delicious! The pastry selection is nice, and the range of foods are sure to appease your appetites, and set you up for the day.
2
In a nutshell, the high-tea was simply carb laden or sugar laden... Sushi selection was minimal and nothing noteworthy on the palate. Scones were pretty good and perfectly sized i give them that, with a more than decent selection in jams.The rest of food items like sausage rolls, chicken puffs and the cake selection were totally unimpressive... The waffles & crepes were alright, just not great. To be honest, even the 3 tiered assortment of finger sandwiches & quiches were not exciting at all. To top it off, the whole experience was below average as we rejected the dancers who offered us tea dance for more than 5 x... not even exaggerating at all, stopped counting at the 5th time and they just kept trying! For us 5 gals, we only met up after losing touch for more than 3 years and all we wanted was to catch up, you would have think that turning down your offer for 3 x max would be more than a clear indication of just leave us alone, they kept coming back! Anyway, i would never go back there again

Sunday brunch in Singapore was very hard to pick a location, after a few reviews we decided to dine at St Regis. We choose the Champagne inclusion. Choices on offer were amazing, I attempted to try a bit of everything but its impossible & just when you think you might have 2nd's on a favourite the chef's turn up with small tatstings & ask you to pick a main (fortunately it was a small portion). The seafood selection was extensive, sashimi, oysters, mud crab my favouries. The prawns, lobsters & bugs were nice but not exeptional (ran out of room to try the boston lobster). The meats were perfectly sliced thin & very tasty, roast beef, ibiricao ham, proscuto & other cold cuts with a huge range of sides to compliment. Then we cant forget the cheese selection amazing - sorry no room for sweets all I can add is they looked amazing. Minor negative was the free flow drink service, the staff did need prompting & when I swapped from white to red there was only one red to choose from although the wine table clearly had a choice of more than 4 which all appeared open (the waiter advised they were for display only which was a bit confussing why have them if they arent on offer). Definately would recommend & would revisit next time I have the opportunity
4
We celebrated my friend's birthday today during the lunch buffet and the restaurant was nice enough to provide us with a complimentary birthday cake and even took the initiative to throw in some teas which weren't included in the buffet. And all the waiters and the maitre d' were very sincere in trying to make our celebration an good one. That is absolutely great customer service. The food was very good as well but i wish they had their macarons today as my friend really loves macarons! Despite the price, i am looking forward to going back there again! Thanks for making my friend's birthday a very good one
4
Went to celebrate my wife's birthday. Pre-arranged with the staff over the phone to give my wife a surprise Well...everything was properly executed on the actual day. The gazebo style private dining area, the birthday day cake and the birthday song sung by the resident singer. Well done!Recommended

We booked the Grand Astor afternoon tea for 3 pax about a month in advance as my sister was visiting from Hong Kong. Was really looking forward to it but it was a terrible experience.When we arrived, we were told our table was ready but when we were lead there, we saw the table we were given was only set out for 2 pax. We assumed they would quickly lay out the setting for a 3rd pax but we sat there for 10min and it didn't happen. We had to tell the waiter to do so, which was ridiculous considering we had booked for 3 pax in the first place. Secondly, we were told that we would be served everything and not once were we told we could help ourselves at the buffet. This was our first time here and no-one bothered to explain the procedure / what was offered to us.Thirdly, their staff are incompetent - one waiter spilt tea over our table but neglected to wipe it up at all; they cleared our dirty places with the cutlery on it but never replaced it with new cutlery unless we asked; we had to send back the pot pie as one of them barely had any filling.We complained to the manager in charge who was useless - all he said was he a thousand times sorry and that the waiting staff were new. I expect for a place like this for the staff to be fully trained in the basics at least. They didn't have a clue - we were paying to eat and to tell the waiters what to do. It was also embarrassing as I had purposely booked this for a special occasion of my sister visiting.Food in general was average - the buffet was okay but the Grand Astor tea / food selection was paltry and tasteless. Atmosphere and ambience was nice, really enjoyed the live music and singer but it was marred by the awful service.Do not recommend here at all for the Grand Astor Afternoon Tea
4
We had a pleasant meal here. We chose the semi buffet which was value for money. It wasn't just quantity but quality as well.The ambience is one of the plus points - old world charm with not too dark lighting. There was lovely live music to add to the atmosphere.We had the pleasure of being served by Yolanda who assisted us from the beginning to the end. As we had wanted a birthday cake but did not order in advance, she kindly arranged for a small cake even though we were content w the strawberry tart we ordered. It was truly service that went the extra mile and gave us a positive experience.She was polite, patient, and very helpful (: thanks yolanda

Brunch is always enjoyable with a group of close friends. We've been to a couple in town but Les Saveurs is now our absolute favourite. Service is professional and the quality of food and wine ans champagne served is without doubt one of the best I've had. Fresh oysters, scampi, lobster.. Perfect Roasts, artisan cheeses, impeccably made desserts. Thanks Les Saveurs for the perfect brunch.

I came here during Restaurant Week,not expecting a buffet at all so that was a nice surprise. There was a respectable spread but I failed to see the French influences in the food. The cold cuts were good, the salads were respectable (but asparagus in vinaigrette was excellent), caprese salad had nice mozzarella but the tomato slices were mealy. Nice steamed seafood in tangy-sweet broth, and steamed prawns. Good selection of cheeses. The soup was nicely seasoned but barely warm and the chicken breast was sparse and overcooked.The dessert spread was the winner here. Dainty tarts, macarons, mousses, meringues were all excellent and made with very high quality chocolate (so was the chocolate fountain). Really good.Good value for the money, but nothing really stood out. Probably not my brightest idea to go for a lunch buffet on a Friday, especially when I had to go back to the office after. I was in a food coma the rest of the afternoon.Service was average; they seemed to be understaffed

I truly had a refreshing moment dining in Les Saveurs especially when I was entertained by the magnificent soul jazz singing by the resident singer. How much more comfortable I felt due to the impeccable service and the recommendation of the ideal wine as I am not wine-savvy.I was there on a weekday evening to experience for the first time the semi-buffet after I became the Supper Club member. It was truly an immaculate evening and special thanks to the staff for making it a memorable moment too. See you great guys soon

High Tea at Brasserie was many things:-- the ambiance was really nice, with high ceilings and a lot of light, and live music playing in the background (Saturdays only) with some dancers on the dance floor.-- the food was delish and the dessert/tea selection was quite extensive-- the chicken pot pie brought to the table on individual trays was mouthwatering. --on the other hand though, we waited about 15 mins to be seated and had to wave our hands every time to get the attention of the waiters--the food selection did not include hot meals like other high tea places--we noticed how the waiters took away scone trays right when guests were reaching for them towards the end of the session, which you wouldn't expect from such a nice place.Would we be back? I guess we would if the service gets better

We chose this restaurant for Sunday brunch based on both the menu and the champagne. The champagne is Billecart Salmon, as opposed to MoÃ«t, which is what many of the hotels offer, but which we don't much care for. We have enjoyed several champagne brunches in Singapore and this was definitely among the best.The brunch offering here is a little different from other places, as you can not only eat as much as you like from the buffet of seafood, salads, cheese, desserts and other things that I have forgotten, but there is also the "pass around" of 7 dishes that are brought to your table. On offer when we were there: pan seared tuna, beef carpaccio, duck breast and dark chocolate fondant, to name just a few. There were also main courses and other choices from two cooking stations. My main of pan seared langoustine and scallops was OK, but not wonderful, but my companion loved his veal belly roulade. The service was attentive, thoughtful and always there when it needed to be, particularly when it came to serving the champagne. We loved the champagne and the white wine, a Chablis, but not so much the red. The breads deserve a special mention, as do the desserts; make sure to save some room. We loved our brunch, particularly as there was one setting, no pressure and some great live music. Towards the end of the meal, a few of us in the room got up to dance and sing along with the band. How great is that

The venue and staff were first class and the buffet was simply stunning and elegantly presented. It was our Aunt's birthday and the staff had prepared a surprise birthday cake.I can't recommend this venue enough, the staff made it a lovely afternoon
5
The room itself is stunning but also relaxing. Never a bun fight For the food. Food first class. Try the high tea, delicious

We ordered Wagyu beef as recommended by the server and we were not disappointed! Medium rare was done to perfection and the meat was a right mix of saltiness and sweetness. We were especially impressed with the good service by servers Posh, tj, Sumeet, Hatta and Seula. They recommended the right dishes for our palette and we're very attentive to us. They even entertained our request for a song request for my parents wedding anniversary and Chemul and Amin performed one of the best "when i fall in love" I've ever heard!Will definitely recommend this place for couples for any special occasion for the good food and service! He professionalism by the staff is commendable. We had a great night

i had a gr8 vacation one must visit here.. pleasant atmosphere excellent service..best service. gr8 food.thanks mr push for gr8 hospitality.

The last time I went there, service is downhill. The place is so busy and you hardly find a server to serve you on time. I went again last week with some friends. I noticed there's no clearing tray in he middle of the restaurant. Service been better for the servers. Most of the management of the restaurants are Indians which tickled me but I noticed a familiar face. I saw Push from 10@Claymore. What a surprise! Well, he's a very detail oriented person who made our high tea so pleasant. One of my friends is quite demanding but he didn't sweat any requests. Thank you and your changed team for the services for the night. Hope to see you soon

This part of the St Regis hotel is one of the most immaculate establishments I have ever walked into. The exquisite ceilings, floor to ceiling windows, and water fountains dancing to lights outside make for a day or night to remember.The breakfasts are one of a kind: of all the 5 star hotels I have visited, this breakfast menu was the most customised, well thought out, and extensive. The omelette chefs are eager to please and make anything to order. All types of other breakfasts are available on the menu by request (everyone loves freshly made food, but I also appreciate food only made to order so it doesnt go to waste),The staff execution throughout service is just lovely to watch. Everyone gets along, and works well together like a well oiled machine. I was gobsmacked to find staff remembering that I drank my coffees with soymilk the day after we arrived: having only ordered it once, and no doubt dealing with dozens of customers in between, they remembered my request. All of these staff are true assets to the Brasserie.The high tea was a feast for your eyes - the chocolate fondue fountain was drool-worthy. This restaurant did everything right at all times.Customers were always made to feel valued and welcome; the staff were even kind enough to accommodate our request to sit in the private booth on our last day.More specifically, a member of your staff by the name of 'Push' not only put through our request to sit there on our last day, but then switched his rostered day off to another day so he could join us on our last day and ensure we got the booth. Push, thank you so much for the way you treated myself and my family. We miss your smile, your stories, and your passion for your work. You are an absolute asset to this establishment, and your hard work coordinating the service of this beautiful dining room is obvious. Thank you for your care.We miss you all already :

It was really a pleasant experience. Friendly service staff and the food was good. The most amazing part is the romantic ambience. Appreciate the live music too. The singer sang a happy birthday song for my wife.

I wanted to share the pleasure of dining here during their Sunday Brunch. The moment we arived at the restaurant the athmosphere was very splendid. The hostess greeted and led us to the table with a warm smile. Food variety was huge and mouth watering. From the fresh and attractive sashimi spread, the heavenly boston lobsters, the various charcuterie, enjoyable assortment of cheese, its really astonishing! Let us not forget the free flow of coffee and tea, special mention the appealing desserts and irresistible ice cream.But what made this dining experience exceptional is Mr.Push, all the while we felt comfortable and he ensured that our table is having a good time. he was extraordinary and passionate at his job. He paid attention to every little detail that we need and made my friend's farewell party a remarkable one. The other staffs were friendly and had a fantastic response too!I will definitely come back and strongly commend to try their brunch and look for Mr.Push. Thanks a lot!

For S$459, my wife and I enjoyed our free flowing champagne Sunday brush at St Regis Brasserie Les Saveurs. Among the things we enjoyed:+ We arrived a bit early and rather than being asked to wait, we were escorted to the bar and given complimentary drinks and canapés. Nicely done ;) + The selection of food was excellent - wide range, remarkably fresh oysters and salmon sashimi + Pleasant view out the back over the pool and fountains (would recommend getting at table looking out of the hotel vs being stranded in the middle somewhere) + Service not overly intrusive and the best thing was that it didn't have the 'rugby scrum' feel of most 5 star hotel brunches with the huge families, screaming children (e.g. the Makati Shangri La) There were a few small opportunities for improvement: - I had to get up and find myself a replacement knife when mine was cleared and not replaced, - it took ages to get the second glass of 'free flowing' champagne (although after that it did indeed flow freely) My wife's verdict - "so when are we coming back again?" PACE YOURSELF. In addition to the main source one selects and the usual brunch stuff there are also 'carry around' dishes. We took 2 hours for the whole meal and could have probably paced ourselves a bit slower and been fine
2
After being warmly escorted to our reserved table, we were surprised when after 20 minutes of waiting we were still unnoticed; no menus or no water had yet been offered. The starters were good and there was a wide selection. The average main courses took a long time to come and when they finally did, one of the orders was wrong. Also upon asking one waiter if one dish was indeed cooked to the stated preference upon ordering he muttered: "I'm pretty sure...this is how it is meant to be cooked anyway" smiled, and turned away.From observing the staff throughout the 2-3 hours I was dining, some staff gave off the impression that they really did not want to be working - rolling their eyes and grunting as they turned their backs on other diners. Not the best way to act in such an establishment, even if they think no one is watching!On the positive side; I think the staff responsible for our table could sense our frustration as a couple of drinks were kindly disregarded from the final bill - but unfortunately our first impression of the place will not change! The atmosphere there is excellent, it is very relaxing and a perfect setting. Finally, the Astor Bar on the other side of the lobby is fantastic, the staff are extremely professional, drinks are fabulous and the music is great
3
Not that great….better of heading down the road and finding somewhere outside the hotel. Service was slow I had to wait until I had almost finished my breakfast before the tea I ordered arrived and the food was underwhelming.

My eldest stepsister treated my family to here for X'mas dinner on last Saturday (28 Dec). It was buffet dinner cum dance. As the restaurant was full, and as per how the table was arranged, there was no way that the guests could get out, so my stepsister called the manager over. He was kind enough to move the plants and the table in front of us. The dinner was buffet style. There were a lot of varieties of food. My other stepsister complained to 1 of the waiters, that one of the dishes is steak, and nothing to do with randang. And the waiter quickly changed the tag. There was also a pasta and noodles station, where the cook would cook for you, if you requested. There were some very good Filipino dancers, who went to our table to invite someone to dance. The dance floor was in fact very spacious, which could accommodate a few couples. The only disappointment is that for such a 5-star hotel, there was no ice cream to be served in the buffet

Six friends met in Singapore for Christmas, flying from Myanmar, Australia and England to be together. We went to Brasserie Les Saveurs for Christmas lunch and it was a truly magical experience. We were offered cocktails at the lovely bar on arrival which was a great start. The restaurant setting was very special. Food was excellent, a mixture of buffet and table service. A wide variety of food to please all tastes, all excellent prepared and presented. Staff were lovely, special mention to Bobbi the chef who made our day (sorry about the Chelsea calendar Bobbi....), he joined in our fun and made us feel so special. Great singer entertained us during lunch and lovely choir also. Staff made us feel very welcome and we felt under no pressure to leave, finally making way for Afternoon Tea diners at 4pm..... We chose the Christmas Brunch with free-flowing champagne, quality of champagne very good and our glasses were never empty.Thank you to all the staff for making this so special, we will definitely visit you again
1
We visited this restaurant on a Saturday for the Lady Astor's lunch delight.Am disappointed to find out that it was a buffet instead.For $58++ per head, it was definitely NOT WORTH it!The meat items were dry and tough; and the rest of the food not that spectacular.Live station for pasta and wanton noodles were sub standard.Only plus points were the service and the ambiance.The biggest upset was we were billed $15 for water which we presumed were included.I will never go back to this restaurant again

There are many champagne brunches in Singapore. Very first requirement is that they keep your glass full. Not so at the St Regis, no champagne at all for the first 30 mins then after that the glass went dry on multiple occasions, having to leave my seat and ask to get a top up. I am a member of the supper club and had some vouchers to use, but they insisted on discounting the vouchers first and then applying the 25% discount advising that was there policy even though it was not documented anywhere. Given this is one of the most expensive champagne brunches in Singapore it really is not worth it. Jan and the team at Dolce Vita @ the Mandarin Oriental provide much more attentive service and better champagne (runinart versus billecart salmon). Would not bother with the St Regis again. Live music was also really poor, like listening to karaoke..
5
We had a party of 5 for a business lunch there in June 2013. The atmosphere is very good and food is extremely tasteful. Service is great. We went for the $48 business lunch and the buffet was great. We'll go back
1
We went for high tea on Sunday and can only say that it was astonishingly bad.It kicked off with utter confusion over our reservation (which was of course duly there) and phantom guests that had been sent off somewhere else in the hotel and didn't really get much better.Our attempt to order a bottle of champagne to accompany our tea was hampered by an inability to procure a drinks menu despite four requests to do so. Once the menu was duly obtained and the bottle ordered, it was still quite a production involving lip stick stained glasses finally trying to get the champagne into a glass.The quality of the tea and produce on offer is absolutely adequate but hardly mind blowing and the tardiness of the food arriving means your tea is already cold by the time you start eating it. The sight of one of the chefs replacing food on the central presentation table that had been dropped wasn't that appeasing either.To top it all off we were then presented with an out of date carpark voucher on departure which necessitated a further trip back to the hotel.We complained to the hotel management but I wouldn't expect anything else other than a polite 'sorry'. An entirely dreadful experience and best avoided, there are far better options in Singapore

I tried The Grand Astor Tea buffet in this magnificent French restaurant, with huge halls and exquisite paintings all around. Sip tea like a tai tai (rich wife) while savouring the scones with jam and sandwiches from the three-tiered silver stand. The a la minute done crepes and waffles are also very good.Food is simple and classic, nothing impressive about the tea set, but ambience is truly stunning.The main menu is probably a lot better, but if you find yourself free in the mid afternoon check this place out for its magnificent setting.Book the more private alcove area if possible for a more intimate, private table suitable for romantic dates or business brunch
5
It was our last lunch in Singapore. I think it may be the best French restaurant in Singapore.A waitress's attitude was so good also. She made us feel good.If I have another chance to go Singapore, it should be my last place again
3
was there on weekday afternoon, it was pretty quiet as only my and couple of tables were occupied. Food varieties were limited for the buffet part, the food quality for the 3-tier hot and savoury delights were disappointing. overall - wouldnt return

There is one reason why I am giving a rating of 4 instead of 3 (or even a 2), and her name is Peyton. She saved the rating on this review by making sure her guests were happy. Hopefully the rest of the staff have started being more attentive since my last visit.Making a short story long, I went for Sunday brunch about a month and a half ago. The selection of food was great, the setting excellent, and my party decided to order free-flow champagne. A word to the wise, if you're in the restaurant business, and several men walk in and order champagne for brunch, they probably do not intend to sip daintily. Rather, they're probably intending to indulge. Correction, they're probably intending to get properly smashed. Don't worry, they have experience, and they probably won't do anything more embarrassing or troublesome than getting the phone number of the nearest cute girl.... But I digress.Rather than getting off to a proper start however, our glasses ended up empty for a good twenty minutes; on the first glass. We finally were able to wave down one of the wait staff after considerable effort (which was frustrating in and of itself), and it took another ten minutes before they managed to locate a bottle. Needless to say, we were more than a little disappointed, not only that our glasses of "free flow" champagne were going empty, but also at the seeming lack of attention by the wait staff. A poor title at that moment as it seemed none of them were actually waiting.We assumed that having to ask for champagne (in my experience with other champagne brunches, the staff usually make an effort to ensure that they top up before your glass is empty, and if they don't, they find it rather embarrassing) would have been a wake up call. Sadly, we were mistaken. The scene above played out again on the second glass. True, maybe we drink faster than other people (one of the consequences when Brits and American's get together I suppose) but again, I hadn't seen this poor of service at other restaurants, and I've been to dozens of these brunches.After this happened the third time, I stopped by the maÃ®tre d' stand, and mentioned the situation to Peyton. She was very polite, and apologized on behalf of the other staff. She not only went out of her way to make up for the situation, but thereafter, our glasses were topped up regularly.For the other staff, honestly, she shouldn't have had to say anything, you work at a very nice restaurant, and your guests expect not only good food, but also courteous and attentive service. Sure, many of us may be spoiled drunks when it comes to Sunday brunch, but darnit, that's what we're paying for. It sort of goes with the whole "free flow" concept.That said, thank you to Peyton and the rest of the staff thereafter for making a concerted effort to make sure we had plenty to drink from that point forward. Your efforts thereafter were pretty good. The food is also excellent, and I thought the singer that day did a great job. Funny, engaging, and a lot of fun.All in all it turned into a pretty good day, and I look forward to the next trip. Just be sure to keep my glass full

It was a special day for my friend. we went for the Saturday afternoon tea. what a lovely atmosphere, it was really feast. 100% entertainment , music, dance, food and service

For full reviews and pictures, visit my blog at ms-skinnyfatI do love the St. Regis Singapore for its array of delectable dining options. There's Yan Ting for fine dining Chinese cuisine, La Brezza for casual Italian and Brasserie Les Saveurs for everything else. Out of the lot, i could see myself dining at BLS most often. Champagne Brunch, Afternoon Tea, French dinner.. there's hardly anything BLS can't execute with panache.In fact, this was my third time dining at Brasserie Les Saveurs. This time i sampled the a la carte dishes prepared by Chef de Cuisine, Antoine Bonnet. The young chef has over 20 years of French culinary experience (he started cooking at the age of 14!) and he cooked his way through France, UK and Lebanon. French cuisine is still his passion as he finds challenge in creating deceptively simple dishes.Our amuse bouche was the Steak Tartare. Light seasoning was used in this version of the tartare. Despite the thicker slices of the meat, the dish was silky and smooth, as was the flavor of the meat. Second course was the Salade Nicoise. I can't never get enough of salads and this was refreshing with a touch of sweetness. Black pepper seared yellow fin tuna, mesclun leaves, quail eggs with marinated anchovies, green beans and Kalamata olives.Next we had the Bouillabaisse Facon Les Saveurs which is a Fisherman's seafood stew slow simmered with fennel and saffron. While the seafood were fresh, i found the dish lacking in the rich seafood flavors that i'm accustomed to in a traditional bouillabaisse. I much enjoyed the lovely Rouille sauce with crusty bread as that added more robustness to the dish. I could die many times over as long as i get my pan seared Foie Gras Poéle. BLS version is that with apple and rhubard compote, "sauternes" reduction raisins and brioche toast. Remember to separate the brioche from the compote asap so that it doesn't get soggy.My favorite dish of the night was the Le Homard Thermidor. Huge Boston lobster flamed with cognac, mushroom bechamel sauce and gratinee gruyere. This is exactly how i love my baked seafood, with lotsa cream and cheese but still maintaining the sweetness of the crustacean. Oh and it's HUGE. Did i mentioned that already

Pros: We have been many times for their business lunch, which was always a delight. We decided to change from our normal brunch venue and we were not disappointed with Brasserie Les Saveurs. We have already booked to go back! Food buffet had an excellent selection to suit every palate. Off the menu dishes were just the right taster size so you had room to sample the rest of the mouth watering food.Cons: Dress code didn't seem to be strict, even though it was supposed to be smart attire. Had some females wearing shorts and flip flops (or slippers as they call them in Asia), which added a hawker feel to such a luxurious hotel. Tip to the management. Please be strict with your patrons regarding dress code! Also food off the menu arrived cold. A chef should not of let the plate leave his kitchen. Price: SGD180 per person is not competitive to other 5 star restaurants, therefore would not go back as often as I would if it was about SGD50 per head less.Over all well worth a visit if you don't mind digging deep into your pocket

I've been here a few months ago and was disappointed.This time, we were two to lunch at the Brasserie "Les Saveurs". We ordered maincourse, the "Bouillabaisse" and sirloin beef, which came very quickly. The service was perfect and pro. All were so good. The beautiful French Chef Antoine came to see us at our table and we congratulated. Back very soon Chef Antoine. Again thank you 
5
This is my third time in Brasserie Les Saveurs. Waw it is getting better and better. I had a very nice dinner with my husband. We had the buffet dinner. The steak is really a generous portion. Highlight of the dinner is the wine recommendation from the manager. He is so helpful and professional. The singer is a jewel for the restaurant. Outstanding. French chef who aproached the table is getting feedback from all the guests. One of my favourite restaurant. Bravo team
2
Having gotten used to pretty good food at St Regis properties in the region, i assumed a similar quality at the Singapore property. The food was poorly executed on the mid week evening we visited. Rather simple dishes like an onion soup and a grilled pork dish which was hopelessly overcooked were v unimpressive. Service was patchy with limited knowledge of wines and very slow. No management was visible either
5
Kudos to the team in Les Saveurs, from the hostess(Sula), the service staff(Lisa), the french chef. we met at the buffet area and the manager(professional & friendly).We were a group of 6 with me and my fiance. We all were overwhelmed by the service by Lisa, the wine recommendation by the manager and the buffet spread we had. It was a good idea by the management to have the main course as an a-la minute dish to enjoy the freshness of the cuisine after a great appetizing buffet spread. My personal picks from the buffet were the refreshing foie-gras terrine, the lumptious salad selection. the yummy mushroom veloute, the macho and tender wagyu beef as the main dish, custard puff for the dessert. Not forgetting the soothing British ambiance of the Brasserie in the busy city. Without any doubt, we will be delighted to dine at this place again and also me and my fiance have been recommending this place to our friends and relatives

For full reviews and pictures, visit my blog at ms-skinnyfatAs part of the St. Regis Arts Celebration held from 29 Jul to 4 Aug 2013, I was invited to the exclusive preview of The American Kaleidoscope special menu created by Chef Chris Kurth of The US Grant, A Luxury Collection Hotel, San Diego at Brasserie Les Saveurs. The 5-course Dinner is based on Chef Chris' interpretations of iconic American favorites.For $188 per pax, guests can look forward to a degustation dinner paired with boutique American wines during this period. The wine pairing changes every night so go check out the list. I enjoyed the Beringer's Chardonnay very much.The Baked Red Beet Root was absolutely delish. This was certainly my favorite course. I love the mix of flavors and texture in this one. A light sourish Ricotta wrapped in sweet and crisp Feuille Brick Tarragon. An airy and innovative Chive meringue with arugula. Pieces of juicy sweet beetroot and some California dates with sea salt. Truly amazing dish.Second course was the San Diego 'Mock Turtle Soup' which is made from braised US Black Angus Beef and Tongue to replace the actual turtle which was used in the past at the San Diego US Grant hotel. I was told that tongue has a similar texture to turtle (which i have never had). Robust flavors in this fish stock dish. Next was the Pan seared Albacore Tuna. I'm not a huge fan of tuna but this was palatable enough. The meat was simply done and i could taste the freshness of it. The powdered brown butter was subtle but went very well with the fish. Oregon Pinot noir reduction and pickled strawberries and a purée of cilantro and sweet onion garnished and added interesting flavors to the dish. The Charcoal-Grilled Colorado Lamb Saddle was my other favorite. I've never had lamb that is so simply done and yet tastes this amazing. Chef used a Mediterranean style of pairing with the sweet dried fruit preserves which worked extremely well. We concluded lunch with the Almond Brown Butter cake with a milk confiture and apricot sorbet with caramelized white chocolate ice cream and black cherry beignet. The dessert was on the whole rather sweet except for the tangy sorbet and the lovely beignet which was like a tempura cherry. Nevertheless, great dense and moist texture from the cake and lovely caramel white choc ice cream.To enjoy the celebration in its entirety, you should get a seat at the St. Regis Midnight Supper, the gala dinner held at Brasserie Les Saveurs on 2nd August. This includes the front row seating at The Whiffenpoofs recital and the 5 course degustation menu by Chef Chris, complete with wine pairing. The St. Regis Singapore will be donating S$100 to UNICEF for every seat purchased at $288. Support a good cause anyone

Enjoyed our time at the restaurant! Lovely view of the pool and water fountains, nice ambience in the restaurant, great food quality. From the breads, the variety and quality of the hors d'oeuvres-cum-dessert buffet spread, the done-ness of the wagyu beef main course to the melt-in-your-mouth seared foei gras, I must say that they took effort to perfect each dish. The staff is attentive to our needs too. Privacy was ensured and they select good seats for our viewing pleasure too! =) Will be back for special occasions..

In addition to an amazing breakfast buffet, I enjoyed the freshly made fluffiest pancakes ever. Thank you St Regis Singapore for a memorable experience

I have been to Brasserie Les Saveurs in the St Regis Singapore countless times. It is a beautiful and opulent French Restaurant with views of the tropical gardens and pool through their floor to ceiling gass windows.The staff is attentive and well trained.Today, (Sat 20 July 2013), we had the Lady Astor’s Lunch Delight and enjoyed the delightful and delicious meal.The hors d’oeuvres buffet was substantial and varied. The main course we selected – the grilled wagyu beef steak was generous in portion and one of the best steaks I have eaten. The accompanying crispy steak fries and sautéed spinach complimented the steak very well. There was a good choice of other options on the main course selections too.The dessert buffet had many decadent cakes, pastries, puddings fruits and chocolates. The crepes corner offered freshly made crepes with sweet or savoury fillings.Altogether a very satisfying and elegantly served lunch. Good Value for money

- Great fixed menu
- Seasonal menu's and ingredients make it even more interesting
- Restaurant has a great ambience, facing the fountains. However, being open to the hotel lobby reduces the exclusivity
1
Very bad service; small selection and bad prepared food ...
Incredible how a Hotel like St.Regis can keep serving such a lousy food!!
2 years since my last trial and it gets even worth ... It explains why Restaurant totally empty..

Quite nice - great room but I prefer Fours Seasons or Ritz Carlton for brunch
Breakfast was Ok but not great

Brought my wife for a romantic dinner to celebrate her birthday. Chose the Brasserie because of the superlative reviews it has received. Unfortunately despite the poshness of the locality, the experience was a bit of a let down.Don't get me wrong, we did enjoy our dinner and the service staff were sweet, discretely attentive all the way though, and the food was good.What let us down was that while the food was good, I would not categorize the food as outstanding in anyway. We had the degustation menu which was organized as a semi-buffet. The quality of the food was very good. No complaints there, but it was really hard put to put the finger on any item that really stood out, and that you wanted to go back for more.What was the ultimate let down for me was the neglect of the fact that this was a birthday dinner for my wife. I had specifically mentioned this event to the staff while making the reservation. She had mentioned a small complimentary cake. Now while I did not expect a boisterous happy birthday chorus, nor even a birthday cake with candles, a small gesture by the staff to surprise my wife on this special occasion would have been very much appreciated. I had been led to expected something and we waited for a bit after dinner, but finally left when I realized nothing was going to happen. This I believe was a serious deficiency for a top class restaurant such as the Brasserie, and indicated for me that they do not know how to look after their guests. It certainly did not make me feel like would make a return visit.So only 3 stars for the Brasserie. Posh restaurant, good food and good service,.... but unfortunately without heart. And without the heart, the experience was just overpriced luxury
4
It was my first time to visit Brasserie Les Saveurs, I really enjoyed my afternoon tea experience with my friends. Service was great, the waiters were friendly and attentive. The restaurant have a delightful ambiance! Love the food! They have scones bar with homemade jams, ice cream, crepes, fondue, etc. I will surely come back to try their lunch and dinner! Looking forward for a superb dining experience!

Delecious food,beautiful live music and awesome people around..really made my day...Big thanks to bls staffs and manager. Defenitely I will come back. Cheers!!

Unfortunately the restaurant staff were a real let down for the restaurant/hotel. Difficult to actually get service; staff are not attentive to restaurant guests and appear to be in need of training - definitely not to the standard expected from any food/beverage service, let alone St. Regis. Table next to us was cleared after the guests had left but the large puddle of spilled milk next to the table was left uncleaned (not only is this disgusting, it's a potential safety hazard) - my husband had to tell the waiter to come back and clean this. The service appeared to be upsetting other guests as well, which made our dining experience unpleasant - this problem needs to be addressed immediately. The food was ok - a decent variety was provided for breakfast. The restaurant is also actually quite nice (settings/decor) but I would probably choose to dine elsewhere if it weren't so convenient (location wise)
3
Came with great expectations, left very disappointed. The restaurant offers a limited buffet of standard fare such as seafood, salad and some specialities such as Pepper crab etc and dessert and then a hot selection to be served on plate. We found the quality of the offerings at the buffet underwhelming and actually had to send the King Crab out and recommend that they stop serving it as it was clearly old and not servable. The hot selection was god tasting but limited in nature, and unfortunately full of fat (rib-eye steak). If looking for a nice Sunday brunch skip this and go for Raffles instead
5
Christmas Day lunch was AMAZING with delicious food, wonderful service and beautiful, live music.The daily breakfast buffet provides an excellent choice of foods which much prepared to order
5
not only is the breakfast/brunch buffet outstanding but the setting overlooking the water garden at the St regis hotel is beautiful. a great people watching experience also
5
extensive. Mine was included, imagine it would be costly otherwise. Parma ham on the bone, actual honeycomb....need I say more?
2
We ate our dinner from here since we stayed one- night at the hotel as a getaway Friday night. While the prices were a bit steep, the food quality was poor and portions small for bistro-type food- in a St. Regis no less.

We made a trip of one month in Asia and the meal in the restaurant "Les Saveurs" was one of the best experiences we had on our whole trip. Chef De Cuisine Alexandre Lozachmeur is a real champion.

Fair selection of TWG tea.Selection of food could be improved. There are only a small selection of hot food (scones, sandwiches, quiche, beef casserole). Service was poor and slow although the restaurant was not full. Cutleries were left uncleared for half an hour. Tea pots were not refilled on time. It took almost 15 mins for them to come back with our refills after a few reminders. How long does it take to pour hot water into a tea pot? The tea leaves were not even refreshed. So by the end of 2nd pot, you can hardly taste the tea.Please don't waste your time dinning here. You might be better off with better food and service at the nearby Shangrila hotel which has more variety of food and over 100 types of tea

I was invited by my stepsister to this elegant French restaurant for dinner on Friday (28 December). It was a 6 course meal. All the foods on the menu are very delicious. The only disadvantage that I have is that I could only choose one main course, as both their turkey and short rib beef were cooked in wine sauce and I am allergic to wine. The selection of French cheese was excellent too. I used to not like so much of cheese, but managed to finish all the cheese being served to me. Their chocolate log cake is absolutely awesome. I managed to finish it, though I am not so much of a dessert eater. I could not take the jelly (as it is mixed with champagne) and sorbet as it had wine sauce in it. The selection of bread was also great. The only thing that I dislike is that it took over 30 minutes for each course to be served. Other than that, there was a live singer and a pianist, and that was nice.  The atmosphere of the restaurant was not bad either, as including our party, there were only 2 tables of large groups of people

The executive set lunch is a good deal and consistently well executed. The hotel breakfast has a rather wide range so you'll find something you like (do order an eggs benedict). Also, one of the most beautiful dining rooms in Singapore. Its also child friendly, with ample space for strollers

Booked for a dinner on wife's birthday and was given a nice cubicle that resembles somewhat like in a balcony in a theatre.Was there on a Tues night, it wasn't crowded and so had good attention from the staffs. No 3 piece orchestra band playing though, but just a resident pianist playing in the main lobby.Food wise, we enjoyed the portion of the mains but felt that the starters could do a little better. We missed picking escargots off their shells. As it was a birthday celebration, my wife was also given a complimentary birthday cake at the end of dinner.Overall, I felt that the amount i paid for was reasonable for a restaurant sited in a St Regis property.I believe the best part of the experience was the smiley service that we were given whole night long. Thank you guys :

Spent $600 for what was supposed to be a romantic meal, but turned out to be a bitter disappointment. It felt more like having a meal in a cafeteria late at night where the staff is desperate to go home.The food was generally very disappointing and very very saltyThe service was the worst I have had in a very long time- Our champagne apperitive arrived after we finished the 2nd course, and I had to tell the waiters to stop bringing us the next course until we finished our aperitifs- At 10pm the waiters decided to get the restaurant ready for breakfast and start changing all the tables (romantic atmosphere gone)- At 10.30 they switched on all the lights (anything that was left of atmosphere was now definitely gone)- At 10.45 they started moving the tables- At 10.55 as we finished desert we were not even offered the option to order tea or coffee (to be fair I was not going to stick around for coffee or tea)Avoid at all cost

All I can say is their Chef de Partie and Restaurant Manager have probably changed. From service to food, it was a huge huge huge letdown. I used to frequent BLS back in 2010-11, this last visit is a shock. Obviously, the team is not aware of St Regis' standards ... the way scones, cream, butter & jams are served are unfitting & unappetizing. The 3-tier dessert stand displayed only sandwiches ... the dessert counter is limited and the cakes & pastries are hard and uninteresting. The beef pot pie is a disaster ... the crust didn't rise and was bland, the beef stew was over-cooked & salty.All the staff are terribly inexperienced ... this is a 5-star hotel & restaurant ... I do expect a lot more professionalism & dedication ... Dear management, if your previous Chef & Rest Mgr has abandoned you, pls recruit well & taste your own food offerings ... it's a disgrace to St.Regis standards!! Any restaurant at Dempsey I rarely have such haste reviews but this is truly disappointing

Wife and i went there for the special brittany blue lobster tasting dinner recently and came away impressed. The presentation was good, the taste exquisite and the value overall impressive. I had my main course changed to a beef which was a mistake as the lamb dish was excellent. My beef was dry and tasteless and it was the only blib in the whole meal. Will be back
