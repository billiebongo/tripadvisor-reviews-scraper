Bought the meal. The burger patties were thick and juicy. Though the price is a bit on the higher side. Staff there were also friendly and polite

This restaurant is in the hotel mall next to Ikea Alexandra. They have good burgers, fish and chips and pastas. Also has good atmosphere for Football.

We were staying in the Park Hotel Alexandra, and this establishment was just below... The proprietor, found us appropriate seating, and a very cold beer, he changed the menu to suit our needs, served the food quickly and politely, and it was lovely...

Visited this cafe for dinner. Service is quick and the staff very friendly. They serve some good draft beer. The fish and chips I ordered was very well made and tasty. Pretty cosy place with dining possible outside the cafe also.

Loved the cider. The variety of cider at Alibabar was mind blowing. tried many of them. Will revisit this place

At the end of a long day being a tourist this was perfectly placed to become our local. Not only are the drinks icy cold but the food is very good pub food. We loved having Alibabar as our local for a few days.

Located in the shopping centre below Park Hotel Alexandra, Singapore we discovered Alibabar. We were looking for reasonably priced dining in a licensed restaurant. Nearby were unlicensed restaurants with exorbitant corkage fees or Street food cafes which were definitely not on our agenda.Alibarbar ticked all the boxes. A beverage menu with a huge range of local and imported wines and beers, a food menu offering mezze and full meal options. We dined for lunch and dinner over three days and enjoyed the food and delightful service. They offer a three course menu with a salad starter, choice of mains and dessert for Sing$12.00. Cool if you dine indoors, amazing air conditioning or like us enjoy the outdoors

This place is at the base of the Hotel Park Alexandra .... food is good and beer excellent, well priced but the service of you sit outside is very poor ..... they forget you .... and this I do not like.Give them a hard time when you arrive and the service improves a little

Had drinks there, a bit noisy but reasonably priced. I don't know if I would go back again but one it is worth trying out.

This street corner cafe bar used to be a local hawker place and now it has been upgraded to cater for cosmopolitan crowd and Westeners. Inside there are for hawker stalls selling beers, western food (burgers, tacos, sausages, etc), Thai, and Turkish. We went there for dinner and only ordered Kebab combo (about S$18), humus (about S$4.5), and sausage combo (about S$13.50). We didn't try the Thai so can't comment on that. The kebab and humus are great. The sausage combo is just average. This place is not air-conditioned so I recommend going there in the evening. To go there from city center, you can take bus #10 or bus #12 and alight before Katong 102 shopping mall

They offered set lunch which consists of a salad/soup, main course and dessert.I had the tomato soup as appetizer, Tom Yum Creamy Pasta as main course and vanilla ice-cream as dessert.The tomato soup was not bad, nothing too fancy.The Tom Yum Creamy Pasta was not as strong-flavoured as I expected. If I were blinded, I won't be able to tell that the base was Tom Yum. There were plenty of fresh prawns and the presentation was good.I paid $12.90++ which added up to $15.20 after service charge and GST

Stumbled across this place and really glad we did. There's a variety of food counters serving burgers, kebabs and local food. All the food we tried was excellent. They have quite an extensive selection of beers too. Well worth a visit. My girlfriend loved the full English breakfas

A -10 out of 10 rating would still be too generous for this vile establishment. I've never felt more violated in my life than seeing what they tried to pass off as food -specifically a duck salad that costs $14.80 before taxes - a few limp pieces of lettuce ( tantalizingly described as a bed of mesclun in the menu) + a tiny handful of shredded duck that looked and tasted like the poultry had died in WW1 ( shamelessly described as oven-baked on the menu) all served within 2 minutes of ordering on a plate no bigger than a child's hand.It is a good place for drinks and the location is good, but any establishment that tries to rip off its customers in such a blatant and shameful way should take a good look at themselves. Disgusting!

Popped by this place for after dinner drinks, and was surprised to find a long list of craft beers from IPA, Wheat beers, Pilsners, Fruit beers to Ciders and more! Affordable price as well, ranged from $9+ to $14. This place is located across 112 Katong and along the main road. Wanted something less bitter and the waiter recommended "wheat beers". Randomly picked 1 from NZ and true to that, the beer was tasty and easy to down. Besides beers, there was also a thai food stall and other food stalls! Will probably visit again to try the food and take a drink

We had light meals here a couple of times and late-night drinks on others during a lengthy stay at the Park Hotel Alexandra, sited above the Alex Central Mall. The menu is pretty limited but we found enough to suit our needs and some decent Australian wine. Alibabar is just one of many small eatieries opening in this new Mall. Typical small sports bar style with large sceens showing different sports, so a bit noisy. The staff were good (all men)

This us d to be the spot to buy Mary's filled tau kwa (she has apparently moved to the nearby Dunman hawker centre), but this is now where you can get good plates of fried mee sua, hokkien mee and char kway teow.There is also a Baan Thai wonton noodle stall, which has been bringing in the crowds. I like the noodles and the fried wontons, but wish they could add some chilli, as the taste borders on the bland sometimes. The flavours are enhanced slightly by the addition of fried pork lard, which gives the noodles a slightly creamy sheen

This hawker centre is a modern one, serving beers and having some other stores with a variety of cuisines.The French Food, Garcons, was horrendous; they served scotch eggs over cheese and fries, a little like a poutine, but how is that even remotely french, one element is canadian and the other is british, a confused mess.The thai cuisine, on the other hand, baan thai, was super good! the mee was fantastic and not over priced! Highly recommended!If you do come to this food court, do try the thai food and go at night it was very very very war

We went to this place in April. We finished our dinner from the place near by and decided to have a few more drinks. The choices of craft beer bottles here were massive. I enjoyed my fruits beer here.Nothing special about this place for decoration in Katong though. I might try out their other outlet in Alexandra later
