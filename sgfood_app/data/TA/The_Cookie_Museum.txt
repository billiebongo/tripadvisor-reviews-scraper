tins make wonderful gifts.

They have many variety of cookies.
Favours are light and interesting. I don't see why I should be paying a higher price for this average cookies.

Have a wonderful experience with fabulous flavoured teas served by the staff in the style of a Chinese tea ceremony with a choice of tiny yummy cookies. And then take some away with you.

They call themselves cookie museum which I do not know why since this is not a museum but a very small shop.They certainly spend a lot of time copying traditional type of art to make attractive cookie jars but I do not know why they do not make original.You can taste many different kind of cookies but I found most of them are same taste...The cookie is not the best cookie I ever tasted and can purchase better ones far cheaper.So, I guess this place is for souvenir but I do not know why Singapore cookie can be a souvenir. Well, I prefer real traditional souvenir if I receive it

I probably expected more "American" cookies which is of course my fault. It's more like tea cookies. I didn't read anything about the store. I just saw "cookie" and had to go find this place. The cookies are good. They have different flavors, but they are hard-ish "tea" cookies. They aren't like Nestle or Mrs Fields or something like that

The flagship store moved from its original location at the Esplanade Mall to Marina Square. This brand also has two smaller retail outlets at Raffles City and Takashimaya respectively.Decorated to the grand Victorian theme, it appears to be just another cookie shop until my family and I walked to the entrance of the shop.The shop manager came to the entrance to welcome us to the museum, and immediately offered us some cookie sampling and started explaining the different flavours available at the shop. She was never pushy, ever willing to dish out different samplings and even included my young kid in the experience while careful not to give him anything spicy.This shop aces not just in service, but also it's interesting range of local flavours such as pandan chiffon, laksa, hainanese chicken rice, hay bee hiam (spicy dried shrimp paste), ikan bilis (fried anchovies), satay, nasi lemak, etc...every flavour tasted authentic yet not overpowering.The shop also sells tea leaves to go with the cookies.I would say it's a must buy as a gift to foreigners visiting Singapore

Whenever I will with a friend from overseas, I will always buy a tin of their famous cookies for them to bring back so that they can bring home something unique and different. Although they are expensive but it something that they remember Singapore and have friends to try out Singapore favorite food taste without having to cook.

With Max Brenner and Loola's very close by, this is an ambitious undertaking. Service is great, but in other things this place is lacking. Its a bit overpriced for the tiny cookies and the tea that they serve. The space also has a weird style...almost like Marie Antoinette's interior designer vomited on the space. Try it out, but you'll likely come up with the same conclusion

Right beside the lower entrance of the Esplanade Mall, you'll find a little Victorian-like tea room. There are only a few tables where they serve a variety of teas. But the real reason to visit is to get some cookies. They have a bunch of the standard tea room fare cookies and some seasonally themed cookies, however the ones you should try are the "Singapore-themed" cookies like nasi lemak and chendol. Some might not work well for you, but some of them are really tasty. And with the guidance of the helpful staff, you can't go wrong

there is a good reason why you should eat here: it is the most artistic cafe i have ever been!

Was it a joke that one square of brownie is $18 to take away? I did ask the girl to check...so over $200 for the cake? Not really surprised that there was noboby in the place.

The Cookie Museum is Victorian styled tea house at the Esplanade Mall. When I visited with my family, we were greeted with friendly, attentive service. With the sound of italian (?) music as a backdrop, the Cookie Museum is a really nice place to chill. We had tea there comprising a selection from the hot beverage menu. After drinks are served,a waiter will wheel a large cart containing samples of all the museums different cookies. Each variety is described in detail before bit sized portions are place at the table for everyone to try. WIth more than a dozen flavors, even with bite sized portions, you start to get full :). The flavors range from exotic - e.g. laksa, nasi lemak to the imaginative - English Lavendar, Rose and white chocolate were the few I could remember. All-in-all a relaxing place for afternoon tea. Be warned however, hot drinks are on the pricier side

I love coming down to the Cookie Museum whenever I want a chill-out from the Shenton Way or Orchard Road crowd. The seating are deliberately kept to a minimum as they cart their cookies and tea for samplings and sniff tests. I love their unique cookies (a bit pricey but to me, nothing beats good quality cookies made with the freshest ingredients and in limited quantities to ensure the freshness). I always rely on them to come up with innovative flavors, designs & ideas for the festive season. My trip back there yesterday was very fruitful as I managed to settle my Christmas shopping for clients within 1 session (which is extremely difficult when dealing with discerning clients). I am delighted that they have now Venetian masks and Christmas hampers filled with beautifully designed tea cups or tea boxes for sale

I love this place. The choco cheese melt cake is sublime. The warm chocolate melt plays wonderfully with the chunks of soft cheese, strawberry, berries, etc. You can also sample the various cookies while waiting for your order. The servers are attentive and cheerful (a pleasant change from the usual harried waiters we see). It is quite small and reservations are a must. I tried getting a seat here on 3 previous occasions and was politely asked to return another day but given free vouchers
