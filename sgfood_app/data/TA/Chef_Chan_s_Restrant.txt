Was my first visit here and it did not disappoint. Waitress was very attentive and service oriented. The food was very tasty, wonderfully cooked, and beautifully presented. The chef was good at the fusion food and really delivered the taste which mattered most. All the dishes that was delivered has unique in its own right. Will definitely come here again

Special occasion treat from family. Coincide with their promotion 50% off signature dishes. We ordered their signature chicken, lobster, spinach, pepper beef and 3 desserts for 4 of us. We were given complementary birthday bun and old wife biscuit for birthday celebration. We enjoyed our meals and not expensive at all as what was reported. It's glutinous rice with ice cream at $4, more general portion then others. Snow pear desserts good for the lungs which took 2 hrs of boiling was good too. Like it's healthier version of food. Would go back again to try out other dishe

Visited Chef Chan's Restaurant again over the week. The restaurant is no longer in National Museum of Singapore; and is now located in #03-17, The Aperia Mall, 12 Kallang Avenue. As the regulars know, the restaurant serves good food and the price is of a 4-5 stars restaurant level. The ambient is good, as is the service. The steamed fish is good as the cooking is just right, giving the dish the right texture and not over- cooked, whereby most local restaurants will overcook the fish !!! The King Prawns are a bite disappointment, as it is overcooked, thus the texture is tough !!! Entertain your clients here, but do watch your budgets !!

One of the best Chinese restaurants in town, their creative signature dishes will keep you coming back for more. Offering great food and excellent service since its inception, they have kept their consistency for high quality Chinese cuisine throughout the years. You will get to enjoy these in a oriental setting, filled with Chinese antiques from the collection of its founder Chef Chan. Truly an enjoyable dining experience for both locals and overseas guests.Their location at the National Museum though small, was the most cosy and apt for a private dining experience. They have recently relocated to a bigger space in Aperia Mall in Kallang

The infamous CHEF CHAN'S RESTAURANT has moved out of National Museum and now relocated in level 3, APERIA Mall, Kallang Avenue in June 2015. The new restaurant is slightly bigger than that in the National Museum; having eleven (11) tables of about 4-6 people per table siting capacity in the common area and four (4) private rooms. The restaurant is opened for business but part of the restaurant is still undergoing final phase of renovation. The food is good and well presented. Service is also good; as this is a $$$ level !!

Getting from bad to worse these days, especially after the original chef sold the restaurant. We went on the dinner of the 4th day of lunar new year, opting for the $130 per head set menu. The abalone was too salty, the sharks fin soup has a strong stench from what probably feels like frozen crab meat, the beef dish suffered from being overdosed by tenderizer, the coconut gratings on the niangao dessert was too salty, even the signature roast chicken was unevenly marinated that parts of it were too salty.... Overall very disappointing meal, especially when priced to be a premium Chinese restaurant

The taste of this every single dish is exquisite. The fried egg plant with salted egg and the crispy roast chicken is one of a kind. Portions a bit small though. Overall a satisfying experience for the taste buds. Coming from a Malaysian this is high praise

I went there for a family gathering. My first time dining in a museum, so I was quite excited about it.The restaurant looked quite atas ;) We had our lunch in a private room with traditional Chinese decorations, antique Chinese furniture and cutlery, and a few photos of the chef and some celebrities, which looked out of place. The room was a bit too dark. I do not quite like the silk napkins that kept slipping off our laps and the cushions on the wooden chairs that kept slipping off the chairs.Food was homely but nice.First dish, fried pine mushroom and deep-fried doufu with thai sauce (tasty but not oily)Second dish, double-boiled papaya soup (simple but pleasant)Third dish, steamed fish with preserved turnip (the turnip was able to bring out the sweetness and freshness of the fish, but was a bit salty)Fourth dish, fried chicken in orange sauce (tasty but the chicken was not very crispy)Fifth dish, fried baby kai lan (nice)Sixth dish, bitter gourd with prawns (taste was good but the prawns were a bit overcooked and the caramel-like smell was a bit strong)Last dish, glutinous rice with coconut ice-cream (great combination)Service was okay. Waiters and waitresses were polite but lacked a bit of sincerity and initiatives.I think to pay about $30 per person for the food is a bit too much, but plus the good service and the nice ambience, I think it is still quite okay

Let's get out of the way that this is one of the best Chinese restaurants I've ever experienced: the Hot and Sour Wanton soup, the Shark Fin with Roe soup, the Black Pepper beef plus the Duck with Herbs have been really worth the visit to this small restaurant hidden inside the National Museum. What really is not OK (worth less than 2 points), apart from the huge bill (more than 200$) and the fact that they (try to) charge you for nuts and towels, is the abismal level of service: we booked for 8:30pm and we had the whole restaurant for ourselves, but apparently the three waitresses were dying to get home and put their feet up so they hurried us for the whole dinner, literally shutting us out as soon as we paid the bill. We did not even feel like asking where the toilets were... For the high prices I think a small restaurant like this deserves commited employees, maybe younger and more enthusiastic about their job

My family & I are Chinese Singaporeans. Lived in Singapore all our lives.Pretty much familiar with what the local Chinese restaurant scene has to offer. Visited Chef Chan's recently.The food was disappointing. Prawns cooked till dry and tasteless.The pork rib was drowning in sauce and the meat was crumbling.The fish soup was fishy. Had to heap on the ground white pepper and huge dash of vinegar.The much raved about roast chicken though nice did not live up to all the hype.At the end of the meal, the bill came with a surprise. Instead of Chinese tea, we had chrysanthemum tea. It cost us SGD$6 per person for tea!!! If you have a party of 10, you will have to pay SGD$60 for tea.This is excessive by local standards.If that's not outrageous, I don't know what is

We were tired after spending time visiting the museum, so stopped at the Chef Chan's restaurant on the National Museum site. The room is very attractive and servers were polite. But the menu was crazy - they gave me the full-meal-deal menu and gave my wife the a la carte menu, so we could not compare ideas/offerings. For many items the minimum order is for 2 people, and these cost as much as $58 (for a soup) so would be $116 (about $100 USD) for 2 people! As well, we could not order 1/2 of their famous chicken - they only sell a whole bird and we could not possibly finish one. We ended up ordering spinach with mushrooms, pumpkin with mushrooms, and fried rice with seafood. Ultimately they added in fees for towels provided before and after the meal and for nuts provided for us before the meal - we thought the nuts and towels were complimentary. I like to know what I am getting and paying for. Too bad that Chef Chan plays games with the bill - the food is very good

Dudeeee this place has some tasty chicken. I mean seriously perfectly seasoned chicken.Chef Chan’s Restaurant is housed in the National Museum of Singapore. It is both a restaurant and a museum, putting on display the collection of expensive antiques that has been in his possession for decades, including furniture, ornaments, photographs, portraits and paintings. The restaurant places considerably more focus on its decor and ambience in its luxurious setting.When the legendary Chef Chan’s crispy roast chicken was served, the poultry panel was visibly impressed, and launch at the blistered bird with gusto, tearing at its tanned skin like hungry foxes. Crispy, well roasted skin with hints of salt and other marinates cackles with every bite and the meat beneath that dreamy exterior is wonderfully juicy. Its definitely something worth trying at least once.In short, this incredible moist roast chicken rocks! This is the true truth as I say it as it is…(www.perfyi.wordpress.com

One unusual thing we notice is everything on the menu is priced for pax and for "minimum 2 persons". Guess they don't like single diner?One of Chef Chan specialty is crispy roasted chicken. It cost $34 for a whole chicken on the ala carte menu. We quickly figure out that getting the $38 per pax set lunch is a much better deal. Unless you really want to eat a whole chicken. The set lunch offers 6 dishes including half a crispy roasted chicken. The other 5 dishes are 1 appetizer, 1 soup, 1 meat, 1 vegetables and 1 dessert. The food is nicely presented and we get individual serving plates. No sharing here. The food taste fresh and seasoned nicely although the vegetable was a bit on the salty side. The specialty chicken is very nice but it is like what we got from many other good chinese restaurant. We really like the deep-fired spare rib. It is very soft and the vinegar sauce is super tasty. We also like the minced fish soup which is something we don't see in many other places.Overall it is very excellent food that looks good as well. Plenty to eat and a very nice experience

This is a good Chinese restaurant in the National Museum of Singapore. Odd policy of insisting that each dish be ordered with a minimum of two portions - and watch out for the expensive Chrysanthemum Tea ($12). But the prices of the entrees are reasonable, and at lunch time indeed one order of two is sufficient for two people. The quality is very good - ingredients are fresh and well prepared

Entering through a National Museum to get into a restaurantis an extraordinary experience.Once you step into the restaurant,the decor offers you another experience. The place is rathersmall, decor ethnic Chinese, crude but sophisticated. Service wasunobtrusively efficient. There are three signature dishes --- crabshark's fin, pepper beef and specially fried chicken. We haveordered all together with one abalone dish for each of six of us.Another dish of vegetable cum fungi, fried rice and fried noodleswere all we had. For desserts we have ice cream with black gluttonized rice and others. The total tab amounts to SGD887.which we think is reasonable

Chef Chan's restaurant is "hidden" inside the Singapore National Museum, though you don't have to visit the museum to get to the restaurant. The interior is classic Chinese, while the menu offers an exciting modern interpretation of Chinese cuisine. I tried the chicken in wasabi sauce which was just WOW. Staff is very friendly and professional. Not cheap, but well worth the experience

This restaurant, with only about 7 tables is set in the National Museum, and provides an atmospheric place for a special meal. Service is attentive (possibly a touch to much), and the food is great - authentic and delicious Chinese food. The only catch is the price - between 2 people we had the set menu, and a bottle of house wine - total price £140. So for special occasions only
