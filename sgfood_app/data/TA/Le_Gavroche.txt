Been to Le Gavroche over 15 times. Love the steak frites and the prawn avocado salad. Nice retro feeling and good for couples, small groups or even larger parties. Great selection of wine too. No complaints.

Casual, good and attentive service, excellent food. The bill gets loaded but overall fair value for money in a "Parisian" atmosphere.

Well what can I say, NOT DISAPPOINTED! Unfortunately we didn't book but we are far to spontaneous for that. Luckily they managed to fit us in at the table's near the door, so unfortunately the service was not amazing as you are outside the main restaurant, but the food more than made up for it! Burgundy Escargot with the special of Beef Wellington, well awesome! That's all I can say! The wine list is a touch on the expensive side with the cheapest bottle around $90, but I went for a Bordeaux at $120, total bill around $270 expensive yes but I've had much worse meals for similar money so I will be back

To be very clear the food is good. What you would expect in a Brasserie :-) It is well prepared, tastes nice and offeres most of the great French classics at a decent price. A well balanced wine list allows you to select from a good varity of wines.The service is very friendly and present, but a little mechanical in the serving. The interiour is kept in brasserie style and well done. You really have a feel of being in France when it comes to the decor

I was introduced to Le Gavroche by friends who have been living in Singapore for several years and cherishing Le Gav. It is a great French bistro with a light and engaging atmosphere. The staff are both knowledgeable and charming. The food sublime. Treat yourself and stop in to sample their delicious French food

Le Gavroche is our go to restaurant when my wife and I need a really good dining experience in singapore.The atmosphere, food, wine and service is consistently good.A great evening at a fraction of the price of flying to Paris for the weekend.Not crazy about the menus on the plastic covered boards. These need to be tossed immediately

This is a beautifully designed restaurant in a very quaint part of town. From the outside it is very inviting. Once inside you are transformed into a Parisian brasserie. The atmosphere inside was very lively. So all in all expectations were high. Unfortunately the food and service then fall short. On both the starter and main course the service staff got it wrong. My starter of poached egg in red wine sauce was tasty and very nicely done. I opted for the sirloin steak which was a generous portion. However, for medium rare it was rather dry. The restaurant has two sittings at the weekend so you will need to be ready to be ushered from your table when your allocated time is up. Not an ideal way to finish a meal. It is worth a try not least to savour the nostalgic feeling of being in Franc

After a first visit we are now frequent eaters at Le Gavroche. Service, ambience , lighting seating , food all complement each other perfectly. Frederic , the owner and chef , is very interactive with clients and is always on top of staff both in and out of the kitchen. Food is of good quality. Well-cooked and presented. Reasonable choice and reasonably priced. You will always get a good bottle of wine here to go with the food. Service is quick and attentive. Nice little bar area to have an aperitif or for a coffee and brandy after wards of you need to stretch you legs. Better still Frederic owns a small café bar across the street from the restaurant that stays open late for that after dinner drink. Good husband and wife team

Lovely to find a traditional French restaurant in Singapore. We found ourselves reverting to ordering in french. The atmosphere was more serious than the café and bar across the street. The food was nice, not outstanding. The wine (Sancerre) was as beautiful as you'd expect and the coffee very french! Just missing some old french favourites from the menu.

Living in Singapore and beeing french le Gavoche is where I go when I m homesick. Food is excellent and the restaurant really feels like a typical french Bistot.It is not exactly cheap, but it makes you travel and reveals the best of French simple bistrot food
