They make inhouse turkish bread, it is fresh out of the oven. You can choose chicken lamb or mix of both.
It is just a delight. One sadwich is never enough lol

I tried lamb tombik and it was quite good. You can really taste the flavour of the meat. They also have an extensive menu, like pizza and kebab. For the meats, I only see chicken and lamb

You will find among the best kebab in Singapore but also very nice cooked turkish dish, bread and sweets.

Saya datang beberapa kali, pertama kali datang rasa makanannya sedap tapi ya biasa saja (rata-rata dibanding makanan Turki yang memang sedap). Lalu kedua kalinya saya datang, ada lelaki paruh baya yang baru tiba dari Turki beberapa minggu sebelumnya -- Mr Ata saya memanggilnya. Mr Ata betul-betul membuat makanan apapun yang saya pesan luar biasa sedapnya! Tidak heran saya datang lagi dan datang lagi.---I came to this place several times times, the 1st visit I found the food okay delicious but not so special (compared to Turkish food at other places). The second time I visited, I met with Mr Ata who just came from Turkey. He prepares the food like a pro, so precise at everything; he makes every food 10 times more delicious than before. I've become a regular customer

In Istanbul this place will not do well. But this is Singapore and this is the best middle eastern you can get for the money . Compare to Shiraz in Clark Quay at a fraction for the cost and about similar quality or little lessI tried the falafel it was dry and did not feel like falafel( authentic falafel is fluffy since it will rise a little during cooking) so not recommendedSalads are goodThe rice and meat dishes are very good, AYRAN yoghurt drink is authentic People are nice, never had a problem with the service , please keep in mind they bake fresh "to order" bread and they cook kebab to order. Only order kebab if you can wait for the meat to cook, about 15 minutes, otherwise just get the precooked meat from the shawarma skewerAlso during the week avoid rush lunch hours (12-1230) and the service is fastOverall recommended and it is nice to find this kind of food in Singapore at a reasonable priceNext to it there is the food court where you can have excellent local selections very cheap , I also recommen

Visited on Saturday this place as it was recommended by people. It wasn't crowded. Barely 2 customers before me. I ordered chicken kebab rice, lamb shish (barbecue) and chicken pide. They took 40 minutes to serve me the chicken kebab rice! So imagine the service level. I finally had to cancel the order for pide as even after waiting for 45 minutes, there was no preparation started to cater to the order.The quality and quantity is average. Price range is S$ 10-14 and one dish may not be sufficient for a single person if he/she is hungry
