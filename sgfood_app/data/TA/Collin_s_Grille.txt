We tried chicken pizza and it was awesome. They cook with so much of love for pizza. Service was also so gentle and good.

As a regular guest, Im really disappointed. I paid the right money for chicken steak but they gave me a small sausage. When i tell them, the waiter gave me a wtf face WITHOUT AN APOLOGY. As I ordered less oil and salt, they put more. What a b-word! I will NEVER EVER come again

A place with a pleasant ambience. Polite and casual service ...noting a full seating. I've Been there for Lunch, dinner and afternoon quiet coffee time. They have Variety combo grills and Drinks- appreciate that we could order hot water for personal reasons. There are food places that say no to a cup of water -without a care of service. Steaks and pastas always a preferred choice and the "must try one day" Pizza! Which I did n liked it Pepperoni! Fried Squid tentacles were nicely salted with a good crisp! Tasty and well cooked were the rest of the soups and mains that followed. Food was served warm in good time.  All smiles after my meal and bill. :) tks Collin's !

My husband and I visited the Jubilee Square branch on Friday for lunch as all the western stalls we were after at the hawker centres were closed.Before ordering, staff told us main sets would have a $2 CNY surcharge while the $2 side add on had $1 surcharges. As we were pretty hungry we went ahead to order their weekday lunch specials that are $9.90 (before surcharges). It would have been nicer if they had done an overall percentile surcharge as main dish surcharge is about 20% but add on was 50% more...We were seated next to the kitchen and it was restocking lots of ingredients while we were waiting, so lots of people moving goods and they mopped the floor twice with heavily scented disinfectants. The plates were large and square so lots of clanging when the staff was washing plates by the entrance to the kitchen. Our mushroom soup arrived first to stave off our hunger.Our orders both didn't come with cob of corn seen in advertised photos on menu. We ordered lamb and fish and chips. Lamb was not bad and had good sauce. Carrrots were crunchy but didn't taste raw. Fish was dwarfed by sides and didn't look as large as advertised photo either. Coleslaw was good. Fries didn't leave you wanting more. However, both dishes arrived piping hot and that's good.May visit again on non ph for the Ben and Jerry's offer without all the surcharges..

For about SGD$15 lunch set menu, it is well worth it. You get a starter, main and dessert/ drink. Portion is good for a standard meal. Taste wise, it is excellent!I have to comment on their service! Although it may not be a 5-star restaurant but it does provide a 5-star service!Given the price, food and service, it is definitely a place I will visit frequently

I tried the food out one evening with my wife and I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food.For its price, its seafood aglio olio is amazing. The al dente was just right and the scent of garlic well imbued into the spaghetti and the prawns that came with it. We asked only for prawns and the service is good, flexible and responsive.It too came with a special prawn (I'm not exactly sure what species it was) and it was soooo sweet and delicious. Not to mention, the other prawns were big as well. Servings are generous.Staff displays confidence about their food and happiness working there.We ordered a ribeye steak as well. Medium. It was well-cooked and have great taste without the need for chilli sauce (which we locals normally go with).All in all, we had a great experience there and will be looking forward to our next visit. Happy days

Service is terrible. Or the staff has a hearing problem or they don't speak English at all... I order tea no teaspoon nor sugar was given to me. Its a simple thing to give a teaspoon with tea and offer sugar and not assume every guest drinks no sugar. The previos time I waited for 15 min and non of the staff even offered me something to drink. Why did I come back? I decided to give it one more chance and frankly Im still not impressed. Such small details they missing if they could improve on that they will be much better. The pizza was not bad... Highly recommending training of staff.

We ordered Grilled prawns (comes with pasta, corn and salad) and Chicken Chop in Black pepper sauce which come with the same sides. We requested for the salad to be changed to double corn. We made the right choice as the corn was especially juicy and sweet! I like my order of grilled prawns as the Mexican Pesto sauce compliments the prawns. There were 4 big prawns, though 5 would be a better portion since this is a main course. My brother's order of chicken chop tasted fine too. The sauce on the chicken chop was generous. We also ordered two extra sides: Just Aglio Olio (which is also one of the sides in our main course) and Jumbo Mild Wings. The aglio olio should be made spicy. There was no hint of spiciness. The Jumbo Mild Wings was more mild than jumbo. It is definitely overly battered and the size of the Jumbo Wings was just small midjoint wings (one box/one side order has 4 wings) so it is not living up to its name, 'Jumbo'. We ordered through Deliveroo and our food came hot. It arrived within 30 min, shorter than the promised 50min despite being a Sunday evening. Total food cost sg$27.30 excluding a delivery charge of sg$3.

Visited this restaurant during the non busy hour. The place was nicely decorated, the selling point of this place is the price and food quality is pretty decent. We will definitely re visit.

Went to have a casual dinner with a friend.
For the price, the portions are generous and the food was cooked well. Tender and delicious.
Location - a little hard to find if you are not a heartlander.

Value for money. You will get top notch quality steaks at very competitive prices. IMO, its better than Astons! I always have my lamb chops here. Cook to perfection and servings are generous. Doesn't get any better for the money you pay.

Environment of the restaurant is noisy, I think some music can help. There's a full bar that serve drinks. It's so wasted when too many people chattering when you are eating. I hope louder music can help.Variety of western foods. Lot of choices, lamb chop, beef, duck confit, Norwegian salmon, pasta, pizza and so on. Prices are affordable, grilled chicken chop we ordered was around $10.90 before tax. Cheese Chicken chop and grill beef was between $12-$15.All dishes serve with salad or coleslaw, fried or whipped potato. Portion is good enough for one person.Service is good and fast. But too fast! The constantly come and collect your plates, I personally don't like, it's an act of chasing or rushing you to leave. Overall it was okay, I just hope they can position the brand slightly higher end than the other western food out there, so that customers can chill and enjoy the food.

The price we saw on the menu last night made us so wonder how our ordered will turn out. My hubby ordered Totale Pizza which made from fresh and good quality ingredients plus crust was thin and crispy as we preferred. I ordered Prawns Marina Pasta which noodle was perfectly firm. The tomatoes sauce was fresh and tasty. The Tigers prawns was juicy and firm. Shiraz by glass was perfect. The service was very attentive and friendly. Definitely we will be back to try out other dishes

The rating should be good but it has dropped to AVERAGE after my recent encounter.I have been to the restaurant a number of times for the last two months because I really enjoyed the food (breakfast & dinner)!Recently, I had an unpleasant encounter with a staff on Sunday (13Mar@8plus). He was quite unfriendly & doesn't put on a smile. He was busy cleaning and he has his glove on which I never thought much about it.He came over & pass the menu to us with his glove on. The menu was a little wet due to his glove. After he took our order, he carried on with his chores. When the food was ready, he served us the food and Again with his glove on. This time, I really felt disgusted. What is the purpose of having the glove on when you used it to serve food as well as doing the cleaning?? After the meal, I asked for my coffee. He didn't even bother to asked whether I want coffee with milk / black coffee. He assumed that I want it 'black'. By now, i'm really disappointed & don't even bother to request for it. I made my payment at the counter. A simple, basic courtesy is to say 'thank you' to your customer but he didn't. Instead, I said it to him. Beside the food, staff really makes the difference in providing service as it does affect the business. I do not wish to be be judgmental over this incident. Appreciate that the management could enlighten me OR improve their service

Tucked away at one end of a coffeeshop next to Block 216, this is a popular eatery and there are always people packing the food for their homes.The food is like what we would cook at home. We had the beef bolognese pasta and the pork chop with sausages and pasta. While the bolognese was not bad, and the beef meatballs were fresh, the pasta sauce could have been stronger with the addition of extra beef etc, but for the price point, it was okay. The pork chop was not grisly at all, and was tasty. It came with pasta in chilli, some lettuce and a piece of corn. Both portions were generous. They also have bento boxes, as well as pork knuckles and ribs, which we will definitely try the next time.Ordering is easy and the token will ring once your orders are ready to be collected

My daughter recommended us to try out this stall in a coffee shop near her primary school at jalan membina near tiong bahru station. It was a relax lunch after GE 2015 and the PAP won the elections with a resounding victory and margin. Congrats to our PM LHL. We tried aglio olio, seafood pasta, meat balls spaghetti bolognese, potato salad and roast chicken and mushroom pasta. All packed for take away and in environmentally friendly paper boxes. The family enjoyed it - super and yummy. We will definitely be back again to makan! Posted some shots of the stall at the coffee shop block 26 jalan membina and the food we tried. Value for money.

Went there after an exhausting day in Singapore. Expected a good food and service but we ended up being very disappointed... Soup was bad and the pizza was not good at all! Even there was nothing to do the staff did not ask us how the food was and nobody bothered to bring the check or clean our plates.Would not recommend this place at all !

The sirloin steak is delicious plus the mushroom soup. They also have a variety of bento sets to choose from. Also, it is located near my house. So convenient and the price is reasonable. Why pay for service charge, GST and travel all the way to town when we can get good food in our neighborhood
