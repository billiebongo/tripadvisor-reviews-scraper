By far my favourite place in Singapore! Great food, great drinks, reasonable prices and a fantastic atmosphere. The concept is brilliant and the shared working space has everything you need not to mention great "co-workers"! Highly reccomended!

Great & funky place to work and eat all day! $50 buys you a workstation for a whole day plus all your food and drinks! the restaurant is separate from the adjacent coworking place called ClubCo; highly recommended for all working nomads!

The place is great, it's main dish is just like the venue name, the meatballs. They're juicier than I could ever cook myself. Well worth trying.

Club Meatballs offers the best meatballs in town! Snacks are tasty and you can choose your own adventure with your meatballs and burgers!

Great food , icy cold beers, indoor and outdoor areas are enough to cater for anyone's needs. Western flavours done with a flair, cannot recommend this gem highly enough

First time here for an event. Disappointed with portion sizes on a steak 'sandwich' ... meat would of fit on a jatz cracker... Next time we'll go to the aussie place on Robertson Quay ....

Fantastic spot to hangout in CBD! Perfect meeting place for lunch or after work drinks. Good drinks, good food, good service!

Little Creatures on draft! One of the first bars in Singapore to have Little Creatures on draft. Great food as well!

The best Eggs Benedict I have tried. I had to go back two days later and have another one just to make sure.This place opens from 10am to late and has free WiFi and serves breakfast, lunch and dinner.They are also licensed and have happy hours for drinks.The staff are friendly and make you feel welcome.While they have a proper coffee machine, I found the coffee to be very weak

I Always see many people here in the evenings. Finally i came by for lunch. The wagyu wrap i had was delicious. There were salads and other interesting bowls to mix and match. Prices were reasonable and had a lovely decor for a casual vibe

Was there on an entertainer app deal. Love their ciabatta bread and fillings. Meatballs were a little on the dry side, but when combined, it wasn't too bad. Used the Chope App to make a reservation so it was hussle free.

Service is really good. Had beef meat balls with pasta; decent meatballs, but pasta sauce are plain flat. One for one beers!

We enjoyed the service here, staff were attentive to our table (probably due to the surprising small crowd during lunch).
Three of us ordered the Norwegian, Vietnamese and Spanish and it was decent. Overall, a nice place to catch up over lunch.

We love the food there. We are not very sure why the side door was kept open all the time. Over all we like the place

Let me begin my review by crediting this eatery for its excellent scrambled eggs. That's the sole reason for me awarding it 1-star. It was highly raced by foodblogger Sethlui, thus we thought we'd give this a try. We ordered the DIY breakfast. Looks super good in the pics, but mediocre taste except the scrambled eggs which could perhaps provide me a teeny weeny bit of comfort that I didn't waste my time here. Our visit began with a shaky 2-pax table (when strangely many 4 seater tables were available). This was quickly rectified upon feedback. Thanks.We were told by food server that kurobuta ham is similar to Parma ham! Who were they kidding! Kurobuta ham here was NOT Parma ham but simple normal ham. Dishonest or simply no knowledge of what Parma ham is. Amusingly, our coffee and tea was serve without teaspoons. We were tickled and of course requested for them. The dishes were soon served without pepper and salt. Toast without butter. Food was really nothing much to rave about. Kopitiam or Han's serves much more satisfying breakfast if I may make this comparison. Ironically, a good breakfast is the most important meal to begin one's day. I can't say the same for this. In fact, it spoilt our otherwise beautiful Saturday. Mediocre lack of smile and sincerity service. Dismissive attitude. Lack lustre food.

We came here on our first breakfast in Singapore, and for some reason went to a western cafe for the same type of breakfast we have at home.The restaurant is quite chic, and they had a decent selection of western standard breakfast. My Signature breakfast was excellent, top marks for presentation too!The waitress was surly though, and inattentive. I ended up getting up and getting my own salt and pepper (and bonus Tabasco!).My fiance said the coffee was excellent (she's an Aussie coffee snob!) and I had a great tea (love the cup!

These guys just aren't set up for breakfast on Monday morning. Opens at 8:00 but... not so much. Ovens weren't "hot" so had to wait 30 minutes to order (wot?) My wife ordered Eggs Benedict (no oven required) and sees the chef smell the old pot and scrape off the top layer (they are closed on Sundays...) so she asks for the sauce on the side (to not cause "trouble") and the waitress comes back and says that the sauce needs redoing and will take another 15 min to make, as the chef looks over to my wife). Place is empty so others may have figured it out. Not coming back.

Boyfriend and I visited this place after hearing good reviews from our friend. He likes his beef meatballs with tomato pasta while I also like my pork meatballs with roasted vege, just a little oily but it doesn't leave the greasy sensation. A pretty light dinner for us and we ended it with half pint of beer. Service team will attentive to us! Will recommend to other friends and family

I was wandering around needing a bacon and egg fix and I had seen this place a few times and took a look at the menu: it had the requisite bacon and eggs so I plonked myself down.The DIY option seemed a good call so I ordered poached eggs, bacon and ham. One cannot have too much porky goodness.My food turned up pretty rapidly, I guess the place was fairly quiet so I tucked in. My only minor quibble would be presentation - it's clearly not their strong suit. The food seemed to have just been chucked on an enamalled tin plate so I was a bit dubious to try it initially but the quality was really good. Perfectly poached eggs and tasty bacon.I looked at some of the other reviews before crafting this - I found the service absolutely fine.Price was a little high for the setting but I would not think twice about returning

Food is great and the portion is just nice. We had eggs benedict and eggs royale with an additional side. Coffee wasn't to our liking. But we like the ambience and its not crowded.

Tastes are strong, sometimes a bit salty but generically interesting taste! the only problem is the quantity of food.
Beef meatballs are the way to go. The pork tasted weird

Had lunch here with some friends. Had the salad which I customised with Wagyu and rosemary meatballs, lettuce, saut√©ed mushrooms and pasta. Hearty but healthy meal all round. Enjoyed the meal and will be back. Coffee was a bit acidic for my taste.Only thing that could be improved was that the staff could be a bit more attentive. Had to wait a while to get the attention of the staff both to order as well as to get the bill

Second time to this place. The food is good but service is terrible. The waiters disappeared after giving us the menu and he only came out a few seconds before we almost walked out after waiting so long for him to take our order. We had to ask for the drinks menu separately, ask for water and he even came back because he forgot what coffee we ordered. Waitress spilled coffee and there were still stains on the cup and plate when it was served. Coffee wasn't great. Ordered the prawns scrambled eggs and pork balls Benedict. Food came promptly and was very good. However service needs to be improved before I consider coming back for the good food ae this restaurant charges service charge and I definitely do not want to pay for the bad service again.

We weren't too hungry so ordered the scrambled eggs & prawns and the boletus pasta to share with two. The eggs & prawns is legit one of the better scrambled egg dishes I've tried with a great balance of flavors. The boletus pasta is alright: great fresh mushrooms and pasta, too creamy and the onion (undercooked) doesn't work in the dish at all. Serving sizes are on the small side. Coffee is by Sarnies so all-around good stuff. A latte was served already sweetened with sugar which is faux pas.About the service: poor effort. The place was fairly empty, yet it took about 20 minutes to get the attention of staff so we could order. One lady was essentially doing all the waiting with a handful of others casually relaxing and putting in some effort once in a while. Unprofessional and bothersome.The bill was roughly $50 and we made use of a $30 voucher promotion. We're unlikely to return because of the lackluster service

I always have so much fun at this place. The bar & service staff are always so attentive and friendly. They go above and beyond. Sometimes even the chef comes out with new food for us to try. The corner that the bar is on has people spilling out all over the road, and it's a real block party buzz! I would come here for a drink any night of the week. It's even busy on Mondays - and their happy hour is exceptional value. Keep up the good times Meatballs!

Lack of service from the very beginning: No one greeted me or showed me any direction for 2 minutes after I arrived. I was very confused and looked everywhere around but only much later someone who's actually sitting at a table stood up and asked if he could be of help.Lack of organization: I was given 2 complimentary entrees by a lifestyle club at this eatery (and that was the reason why I was trying it out with friend). The service staff completely had no idea how it worked so they came and check my card my email and a never-existent serial id multiple times, very annoying, and such experience never happened when I dine at other affiliated restaurants by the same lifestyle club.Incompetent kitchen staff: I ordered a simple poached egg dish. Both eggs turned out much overcooked when finally delivered, I showed it to the waitress, she kindly took it back. On their second try, only 1 out of the 2 eggs got flowing yolk inside after I cut it open, the other one was still much overcooked with a solid center. The bread underneath the eggs was too dry, the salmon minced meat was also very dry and lack of flavour. What a turndown! I didn't send back the 2nd time only becoz I was starving after all the waiting and could bear more waiting.In the end, we decided to cancel our order of desert and just get the bill coz the waiting time was too long. We were thinking, let's just get out of here, what else could go wrong after they pretty much screwed up everything already....guess what? The waiter came with the wrong bill! On the bill they charged us the complimentary food as well as the cancelled desert. It was the last straw - how could they manage to screw up all the way??I and my friend will never return to this restaurant again, and I certainly would warn anyone beforehand if they decide to give it a try

While the meatball combo was decent, for 14sgd, it was a small portion and I left the restaurant still hungry. To top it off, the waiter dumped a meatball down the front of my dress, accidentally of course, but didn't offer a free drink or discount which I thought was the least he could do

Went to club meatballs on Saturday night as a couple and thoroughly enjoyed the delicious flavoursome food! I really recommend the pork and fennel meatballs with the Parmesan risotto, absolutely incredible! Opted for the red wine sauce on these. Also absolutely loved the chorizo cheese toast to share, sooo tasty! Good value wine, especially in happy which ends at 8pm so be sure to get there before. Unfortunately they did not have the sliders in stock which we were looking forward to sampling and there wasn't really any atmosphere on a Saturday, that's why I have dropped one star. My friend went on a Friday night and apparently it gets extremely busy and much more atmospheric when people go there from work to begin the weekend. Be sure to book a table on a Friday. Nice waitress and service. Amazeballs

Since I was meeting up with a fellow meat-lover in CBD, I decided to take him to Club Meatballs. I had never been to this new concept restaurant, but had heard about it from a few colleagues and decided to go check it out. There is an interesting mix of Spanish and American influence, and overall the food was delicious! The 100% Waygu beef red burger is definitely a must for burger-enthusiasts, and for something a little more refined, check out the exquisite Iberico pork and fennel. Their desserts were also worth indulging in, notably the white chocolate cheesecake & yuzu. When I‚Äôm in a carnivorous mood, I would definitely head back
