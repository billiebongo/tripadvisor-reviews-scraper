It is a good part this this hotel, offering a variety of food and drinks, all reasonably priced. The staff are friendly, helpful and attentive.
A great way to pass spare time looking out of the windows at people and traffic in Bencoolen Street.

Good service and polite staff, but the food was average and we didn't finish it. We ate burgers and fries. The coctails were nice.

The restaurant seems small inside.
The food is ok, the price is reasonable for a three star hotel in Singapore.
but i hope they could arrange the tables and chairs better not to bump with other guests on the next table during breakfast.

Good part is the restaurant is open for 24 hours but the choice if food is limited but good enough. Staff does not seem to be very responsive at restaurant.

This place is great for hanging our for some drinks and food. Not very expensive but yeah food is delicious and up to the mark.

The bout was nearly empty every time we walked through when we left the hotel. If you are after a quiet place to read the paper and have a drink it would suit you. Nicely air-conditioned on a hot day

A good dinner at Le Bar is inexpensive and provides good, local cooking. On the eve of the National Day the buffet is open with the best of local cuisine: I had this experience and thoroughly enjoyed it. Dishes tend to be spicy, with a lot of seafood. Staff are attentive and very helpful and really made me feel welcome as a visitor.The restaurant is not sophisticated dining: it is like an up-market cafeteria, but the quality of the food and the excellence of the staff make this exceptional value

A bit too pared back in its offerings from my perspective but a convenient meeting place for going out on the Town. Easy to find and near all the transport options. Taxis and Uber and others at the back door on Bencoolen Link make it an easy trip anywhere. They even have a apple pad to order a Get Go car or whatever it is called...
