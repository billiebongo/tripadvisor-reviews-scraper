This food court is pretty good located next to Isetan super market. They have Katong Laksa, Bukit Merah Fishball, etc. and other stalls. Clean and spacious.

South eastern Chinese food with good quality. Service is neither lacking, nor too bloated. We enjoy our meals here very much.

Went this place for dinner to celebrate my friend's birthday. We got seated immediately, atmosphere was cosy and the staff were very attentive.Ordered rice dishes and their Xiao long baos in different "flavour". Some are nice and some are so so. Overall is a good dining experience.

First time I tried this place was with my friend and her family for lunch. Came back again for dinner with my family.We ordered, Signature Dynasty xiao long bao, Radish pastry, stir-fried French bean with minced pork, stewed sliced fish with Chinese wine sauce, crispy chicken, fried rice with egg and double-boiled chicken soup.We enjoyed it very much

The simple fried rice with eggy top layered smells great when served piping hot on the table. Xiao Long Bao with eight different tasty flavored choices add ups to our feasting joy. Great services with bags holding rack and smart queue number ticketing system is definitely a double plus thumbs up.

Sign up to be it's member and enjoy special deals for afternoon sim sum. I fail to appreciate English afternoon tea, too sweet for me perhaps other than the cucumber sandwich which is too bland for me. Give me good dim sum anytime to stave off post lunch hunger pangs or take a light lunch yo savour the delightful noodles etc thereafter

i have dined at this restaurant several times, and i must say their food and service are always consistently. food has the same taste, service still needs more improvement. no smiles, especially the staff from the kitchen wearing black who serves the food. she looks very fierce with her tattooed eyebrows. anyway, it is quite difficult to communicate with them if you don't know how to speak mandarin. my limited mandarin skills are always challenged. and what's up with not giving out serviettes? even if i asked for it, it never came

Went for early dinner on a Sunday. Good food and service, but we're able to see the crew having meals with their "prison-like" metal utensils. Maybe the restaurant should have a partition to block customers from being able to see the staff having their meals.

Had a gathering for 14 people over the Chinese New Year Period. Food was definitely overpriced and limited selections. Service was bit slow as well. We spent almost $40 per person and still had to go to MacDonalds after to be full.

Was craving for some dim sum lunch but the varieties of dim sum available is not that many. Ended up ordering the egg fried rice which surprisingly turns out quite nice.
5
As I and my family like the dim sum we normally go this res more than 2 time a month. Nice local brand with membership benefit.

Always need to wait even if the restaurant looks empty. Food is okay and priced quite reasonably but most of the service staff are not attentive nor friendly.

I like the multi colour xiaolongbao. Visual Pleasure. Food serving is slightly smaller for a family of 10 so just order more dishes. Serving time due to lunch hour is slightly slower.

My family of 6 adults and 2 young Kids had dinner at Paradise Dynasty Restaurant at Westgate Jurong East.The restaurant’s layout is not big in scale and it has a casual family atmosphere and is very popular with dinners. The restaurant’s decoration is simple but very pleasant. The service staffs of the restaurant were very friendly and helpful when taking down our order. We ordered Fried Rice, Deep Fried Chicken, Spring Rolls and some other side dishes which were very delicious.We enjoyed our meal and wouldn’t mind a return visit

but service a little on the slow side. I'm not into hot spicy food and went this restaurent for a business lunch. WOW, the food and the flavours were perfect and more than enough food. Not sure of the price as I didn't pay but I'd recommend it

Fortune Set menu is the menu order. The service is so rushing. As i have pre book the sit with this menu. The staff just get us to the table and start serving with out letting us to order the drink -.-. Then after the first dish up, which is very fast the first dish is up then we gotten our chance to order the drink

Had a family dinner for a group of 8. Most of us had noodles (ramen). Not disappointed at all. Soup was rich. Also ordered the garlic pork ribs which we found to be quite dry. The radish puffs were simply great. The signature dish, xiao long pau lived up to expectation. Overall, nice place but not so good service. Also this place is not a good value for money place. mid- to high QPR. Watch out
