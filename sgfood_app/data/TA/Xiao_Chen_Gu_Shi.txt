This is a Bak Kut Teh place for locals which means they focus on mainly producing a pork rib soup or offshoot dishes which one has with rice and some sides. There are many of these restaurants in Singapore and they are a branch of Southern Chinese cuisine.We had pork rib soup, braised and roasted pig trotters, tofu, pork tripe soup, rice, and a few smaller dishes. $32 total. And very tasty. The soup is peppery but not spicy and quite a fulsome broth. There is a reasonable amount of meat on the ribs. And the sides were all good. Basic decor with stools and rows of communal tables. Fans only, no air con and all open air to the road although set back far enough you do not notice traffic. Around the corner from the buzzy bits of Clarke Quay. Better to eat here than some of the restaurants in Clarke Quay, but then go somewhere else for entertainment
