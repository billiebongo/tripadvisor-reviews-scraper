The noodle doesnt look good, but it‚Äôs taste very good üëçüëçüëç. Pork there is not dry and the salted prawn is not oily.

Bad service and very rude boss and staff. Cramped environment. Raises his voice and speaks rudely to us and noticed them treating other customers very badly too. Most of the guests tried to ignore their bad treatment or had a change in their faces. He said his business is vey good and if the table we reserved is too cramped we can queue again and that even if it is too cramped the table will still wanted by the many other people queueing. His staff were also seen shouting at other customers saying their boss ask them to clear their table immediately but they had only just finished eating. We ended up leaving to head to another restaurant so we don't know if their food is good but there are many good food in Singapore. You need not pay to put up with disrespect

This is a spacious and bright restaurant, but extremely noisy. We were excited to be able to obtain a table booking at short notice as the reviews had been good. Most of the dishes we ordered today turned out average and below average. Only the egg plant and potato with salted egg was good. The tofu was best forgotten, the prawns with salted eggs were salty and not fragrant, fried fish head was average. The lala, whilst plump and large, contained a lot of sand, and was served to us cold. Even their signature dish of Sum Lor Fried Bee Hoon was not as exciting as expected. We were most thankful that their toilet was spacious and clean, but located up the stairs on the second floor.

We came in at past 8pm. The place was crowded and noisy, both frm guest and servers. We luckily got a table, we tried the signature dish, white pepper crab and beehon. Also order spicy Kankong and Prawn in salted egg. Quality of food is average, customer service needs to be improve a lot. Additional ordered rice tooks time to be serve. Over all i only appreciate the beehon

I went with hubby for dinner. Waited for not too long as it was around 6+. Upon seated, I noticed the service staff were always shouting to communicate. We ordered 3 dishes and 2 came quite quickly - the signature beehoon and fish soup. But food is not hot and we were seated where the aircon was blowing at our table so needless to say, it turned cold in no time. Our 3rd dish salted egg prawns took forever to come despite we asked few times. A lady staff said that this dish will take longer. It was still not served when we finished our food so we decided to leave and asked for the bill. They charged us for the 3rd dish and when we told the staff the prawns was not served, he went to check and came out with it. By now, we don‚Äôt feel like eating anymore since there‚Äôs nothing to go with it and we were tired from the wait. We told the staff and he said I‚Äôm only a service staff, what do you want me to do? Then, the lady staff came over and said that she already told us it will take long when we first ordered but she did not. She only told us when we checked. She said that they cooked in batch and we couldn‚Äôt reject the food just because it took long. So it became our fault. Then, the boss finally came to ask if it‚Äôs ok. I had alerted him earlier that we were still waiting but he simply ignored me and walked to serve another table. I told him we waited for very long and finished our food now. His reply was they were busy. Ok, so I have to be an understanding customer if I am to eat their sub standard food? Needless to say, this will be my first and last time stepping in there and I‚Äôm sure not to recommend it to anyone.

The food especially the noodles which do not look good are great. I like especially the noodles as when you start eating it you cannot seem to stop as it is very tasty. Overall, they serve good Tze Char food. For seating, I would recommend sitting in the non air-conditioned area. Reason is that the noise level in the air condition area is deafening.

We kept calling to make a reservation but no one answered the phone. We didn‚Äôt know if the restaurant was closed or they were just too busy they didn‚Äôt bother. Ah Meng opens 7 days a week. We came with recommendations so we knew what to order. Ah Meng didn‚Äôt disappoint us. We love every single dishes. Thumbs up the White Peppered crabs..fingers licking good. The Curry Fish Head...MeeHoon...Salted egg Prawn balls...Chilli Clams...Dragon Vege...Salted Black bean fish...all were superb. We loved it!!!Michelin 3 Star awarded establishment. It‚Äôs better than the No Signboard Seafood few blocks down the street

Not the best restaurant environment. A bit noisy and coffee shop environment. But the white pepper crab was amazing. Very flavourful. The prawn paste chicken was also yummy. The fried mee hoon also a hero of the night. We had the black pepper pork neck. It was good but nothing extraordinary. We will try the other pork dishes next time. Also had some vege which were pretty good

The food was great and everything we ordered was delicious...service was simple and abrupt but the food was good so we didn't mind. The noodles are a must have.
4
The noodles, white pepper crab & fish skin were delicious. Worth at least one visit. Need to go early on weekends. We arrived at 5.30pm and it was already more than half full.

The food was very nice and tasty.. we order the Bee hoon, salted egg yolk prawn, clam, kang kong, crispy fish skin...

This restaurant deserves a round of applause. The food is super delicious and both times I went the food was consistent. Now not converting back the currency to ringgit, and taking it dollar per dollar, the food there is reasonably priced. We ordered so much both times and was happy to see that our bill never toucher the SGD200 mark. The noodles was a staple for both night

Was brought here by a friend living in Singapore. We got there around 7pm so it was a little difficult to get a table, luckily Aunty (the old lady working there) didn't stop looking so we just waited for about 5 mins before being seated. The people here barely speak english but they are patient enough to try to understand you and their menus have pictures of all the dishes so that makes things easier.We ordered the white pepper crab which they are known for, kurobota pork dish, salted egg prawns, garlic clams, the bihon (noodle) dish (sorry i forgot the name) and the vegetable and tofu dish. Everything was absolutely delicious! My favorite would be the prawns, clams and the pork! We only ordered the small serving size for all the dishes so that we can get to taste more dishes and our total bill amounted to about 120 SG. Not bad for the amount of food we got!

been here 5 times and always ate their signature food - crabs, bee hoon, stir fried lotus root, prawn balls and others. food was value for money, in generous proportions and quick. place is noisy, the service standards do waver each time but i can live with that for the food quality.Bookings are essential

Service is bad and food is just average. Waited for 1.5hr for a table of 4. Just not worth it. Ordered a steam fish and it was mushy. Didnt finished at all. The fried fermented pork belly was good. The meehoon in jalan basar is better.

I've been sitting there for 20 minutes being treated like I'm a ghost. When the owner did come around to take my order, he went to a table with more people before taking mine. I ate with my Girlfriend, so if I don't have more people and spend more I'm less important?10 minutes for a glass of water and barley is ridiculous. I've spent almost an hour with no food in sight and lost hope when a table of a large family who has been there before us got only ONE vegetable dish. The water tasted like water, and barley, was barley. I didn't get to taste any sort of food cause of how slow they are. It's like we're a God forsaken being there. They don't even acknowledge us as customers. So what is good food when you have poor service? I'd rather pay to be treated better than try their food any day.

If you can overlook the chaos, the long queues, difficulties in getting a reservation then the quality of the food makes those challenges worth their while. Some signature dishes are unique to this place, while others, such as the white pepper crab and chilli clams are notches above other local seafood establishments both for the taste as well as the freshness and affordability. Nothing to fault about the excellent cooking or the freshness of ingredients.Could well be the best tzr char joint in Singapore.

My sister who lives in Singapore was recommended to eat at this establishment and so glad I did. It's local zhi char food. We had some of their signature dishes, from their noodles, clams and prawn all cooked in their unique and delicious way. I highly recommend eating here. There is no booking so best to get early. If it's good for one of the best chefs in the world to eat here, Ferran Adria, then it must be superb and indeed it was

The beehoon doesn't fail at any time, fermented roast pork were tasty as usual. A fantastic location for dinner or a late night tasty treat!

Tried all the signatures dishes and not disappointed. However take note to book a table in advance and is very crowded. Long wait for food to be served but is worth the wait.

San Lou Bee Hoon is a must. It is wok-fried Chinese vermicelli that redefines your understanding of how noodles should taste like. Side dishes are generally good.

There are many great eats in this red light district and JB Ah Meng is one of them. Food lacked presentation buy they taste awesome. Reasonably priced. Operate till 2.30am ! A place one can go for late night supper. Worth a re-visit.
3
We went there for dinner and waited for more than 15 mins for every dish. Their signature dish Bee Hoon was oily especially the bottom layer, other dishes taste so so, nothing special. Furthermore the location is difficult to get a parking lot. We would not return next time

Heard so much about this zhi char restaurant that i decided to bring my family there for dinner. Glad that we went there early at 5:45pm as we did not place advance reservation. The place was fast filling up while we ate. We ordered their signature fried bee hoon, la la, lotus root vege, mixed vege, pork rib and pepper . Service was fast and the food is very good. The bill was also reasonable. Will return, and will reserve in advance.
4
Heard the raving reviews about this place so had to try it. The queue was very long at about 630pm on a Saturday evening but we persisted and waited in line and didn't regret it. The food was excellent and dishes were served promptly. All in all a good meal but be prepared to wait in line

San Lou Bee Hoon - do not judge the dish by its appearance. Visually not appealing but taste is good .. has 'wok hei'.White pepper crab meaty, fresh and pepper is just right, not overwhelmingly pepper-hot.Advisory - Book table in advance especially weekend dinner, or else end up in long queue. Also need to wait about 40 minutes for first dish to be served from the time of order

We loved all signature food dishes here at the famous busy local restaurant in Gerang area. The spicy white pepper crab is super delicious while its mee hun is very yummy. The egg york prawn is quite tasty and the morning glory dish is as good as at any other places. Queue is long though if you come late.

When we visited the place the restaurant was waiting for its liquor license although beer was on the menu.Their signature dishes not that fantastic but prices quite reasonable. The choice of dishes come in small, medium and large sizes.Difficult to find parking around the.area
