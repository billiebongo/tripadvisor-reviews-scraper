All aspects have chef Stephane’s challenging spirit and his tast of style, and certainly I loved it!
I especially liked the bathroom atmosphere. You must go to check it out!
5
Amazing food, hugely friendly service and lovely ambience. The staff even remembered the wine I liked from the previous visit. Strongly recommended
5
I am amazed by Chef Stephan's creativity all the time I visit. This restaurant is amazing, can accommodate your food restrictions and create a bibgourmant dish just for you as a surprise.
5
Went there with some friends and we had the 6 course menu. It was a fantastic experience and we loved it so much that we went back for a colleague’s farewell.
5
Unpretentious and a taste adventure! Love how each ingredient is named and described so we can taste each morsel for ourselves
5
We had a very nice 6-course dinner and the quality of the ingredients, the service and the dishes presentation was excellent.Although not cheap, the value for money is clearly good, especially the wines which are in various pleasant price ranges (which is usually not the case in Singapore).
5
I've eaten at a great many restaurants in Singapore, and particularly many that promise a calibre that they just can't seem to attain to the standards you would expect when paying at least $100 for a meal. Chef's Table by Chef Stephan was a welcome surprise in many ways. The look and feel is relaxed and comfortable, the high chairs were a surprise but the comfort of the seats meant we were relaxed and could enjoy our meal. The staff were exceptional, from the young man (I swear he looked 16) to the Chef himself, everyone was polite, informative, knowledgable and friendly. And the food was excellent. Interesting flavours with interesting ingredients, highlights were the yabbie and scallop dish served with an addictive sauce that made me want to mop the plate. Haddock was also excellent and the duck as well. The wine pairings also added both interest and complexity. From Austrian Rieslings to Portugese whites and reds, we enjoyed each one and also the conversations with the lovely Sommelier. A 5* experience.
5
It is difficult - I find, to be impressed with a restaurant in Singapore when you are surrounded by so many good ones. The chefs table did surprise in the concept ( select what you don't like and we will will ensure you have a great experience) and knowledge of the Chef and Sommelier who made the evening about the food and wine in which all our friends had the same positive view. Half went for the 4 course when the other went for the 6 course with wine pairing - flavours and presentation wonderful
5
This spot is fun and inventive. The menu is up to the chef and you only tell them what you donâ€™t eat. It was a surprise every course and all dishes were excellent and tasty. Flavors were nice and the overall tasting menu was not overdone or too much food. The wine pairings were outstanding and complemented the nice dishes. Service was friendly and excellent. Overall a really fun and nice experience in Singapore
5
Always a pleasure to dine in this restaurant. The chefs and the sommelier take great pride in the food and wine they are offering which makes the whole dining experience very enjoyable. We had the 6 course degustation menu which was balanced and delicious paired with the 4 course wine pairing. Never fails to impress me
5
We will come back again to try other creations! We enjoyed the food, ambience and service very much!
4
Table for five for a business dinner and it was just an amazing experience.
The dishes were well prepared and balanced. Wine pairing by Alex was also good.
Great service balanced with enough warmth. Definitely worth eating at least once!
4
My wife and I love this restaurant. You get to choose from the extensive menu of fresh ingredients which changes regularly. This is great as we can choose to eat in a variety of ways: vegetarian, seafood, etc. I love the way the chefs explain each dish as it’s served. Service is excellent and the beverage list is pretty decent too! A must-visit for everyone.
5
what an amazing experience & this was the second time runningStephan & Lorenz are magicians with fresh food they buy on the day (no set menu) and knock out one perfect dish after another at unseen levels to a worldclass standardThe team is amazing and Alex the sommelier will give you a perfect pairing Don’t forget to try their stunning barrel aged negroni I dream is this place and coming back soon... Absolutely amazing and deserves 6 out of 5 stars!

We visited Chef's Table with our two teenage sons who were looking forward to an Austrian restaurant in Singapore :-) The two chef's and their lovely restaurant manager Alexandra Brito gave us all 4 a wonderful meal and 2 of us a super wine pairing and truly one of the best services we have ever had, if not the best. Obviously not very Austrian, but very international.Every dish was explained in detail by the chefs themselves - both in english, german and tyrolian.... The wine optimal paired to the dishes (which part of the world a pinot noir has to come from is obviously a personal judgement.. ). The concept of the restaurant to offer a selection of 28 key ingredients currently in season and in use that guests can cross out from if they don't like them, is an excellent idea and is use to create a sublime diverse set of dishes - to an incredibly fair price whether you choose the 4,6 or 8 course menu (we went the whole way).We loved the whole evening and cannot wait to come back again after having taken our teenagers to Austrian restaurants - in Austria....
5
I was here celebrating my birthday whilst on a brief trip to Singapore - and what a treat it was! We were notified in advance that there was a large reservation on the night and asked if we wanted to change out reservation by the Chef himself, which was a very nice touch. Once we arrive, the staff were incredibly friendly, and the food was just superb. The Chefs brought beautiful and delicious dish after dish, with great wine pairings. The setting is just superb and we really couldn't have asked for any more - it totally exceeded our expectations
5
Had dinner with some friends - we all agreed that the cuisine was one of the best we had ever had. We selected the 6-course degustation menu which was perfected crafted to appeal to a variety of taste buds. Service was excellent - Chef Stephan and Chef Lorenz would come by your table at each serving and introduce the dishes. Love the ambience especially the high chairs. The Saturday evening crowd was lively but pleasant? Restaurant Manager Alexandra was attentive and entertaining. Totally enjoyable evening and highly recommended for an evening for good food with good friend
4
great friday lunch experience.good services, great food in taste and presentation. the onion butter is to die forthe coffee is from julius meinl, its amazing to know they really go in details for even the small thing.i will definitely come back here for dinner experience! the
5
Myself and some friends had a wonderful meal here.The menu and staff are really accommodating to your wishes - you can specify ingredients that you don’t like and these will be left off your plate, but it doesn’t affect other diners on your table! We were also given the option to mix and match number of courses, with half the party choosing 6 courses and half choosing 4, I’ve never found this anywhere else! The food was amazing and there were so many interesting flavours that it was impossible to choose a favourite course. Really highly recommend this place for unpretentious fine dining in Singapore.
5
Wow. We have our foodie moments and have tried a number of omakase style, high end restaurants in Washington DC, New York and Berlin. Chef's Table rates right at the top, and on a relative price basis is an incredible value. The food was delightful, the flavors really popped, the wine was very well chosen, great service, what more to ask for. A restaurant this good should have at least a four week waiting list like it's peers elsewhere. We're grateful it doesn't...... yet. Thank you for a wonderful evening
5
I love the concept of this restaurant!! We had one of the best dining experiences from the food to the wine to fantastic service and even better food! Thank you for a wonderful experience, we will return.
4
A personalised Omakase experience with the chefs preparing & serving the dishes.
Had their 4 course special lunch, only on Fridays. Exceptional quality of ingredients and service. Would definitely return here some time soon.
5
We're back again after the memorable experience by Chef & team at our first visit months ago! Back for more and there's always surprises await to unfold at every new course served on the table by Chef & team! Mama-mia!
5
Chef Stephan was exceedingly attentive, down to the smallest detail. We opted for the 6 course dinner and each course was brought to us by the chefs personally with a brief introduction of the dish.
5
Basically a daily menu with a list of ingredients. You tell them what you don't like and choose 4, 6 or 8 course meal for dinner. Good selection of wine including some from Austria.The food was very very good with a new take on the use of the ingredients. Will definitely go back!Good value for money. I recommend you either go for 4 or 6 course meal.This place is not for you if you are in a rush. Relax and enjoy yourself
4
Dinner for 2. Was just amazing. The wine pairing by Alex was also very well put together- Highly recommended. We both had the 8 course. Was good to see the chefs in action.I would say the savory food,was outstanding. The deserts were good but not outstanding
5
Came here for my anniversary dinner based only on on-line reviews, including TA. We were both very happy! This summer I did an extended trip across Europe, and ate at over dozen Michelin starred restaurants across Spain, Portugal, France and the Netherlands. Using that as a basis for comparison, Chef's Table would certainly meet that standard. I've never not an enjoyed a meal at such a restaurant, though at times felt that the attempts at creativity were strained, or that it simply was not worth the money, even if good food. At Chef's Table, I thought they did an excellent job of crafting dishes that were fascinating combinations of tastes, for what is a very reasonable set menu price. Recommended wine pairings also seemed quite on mark ("seemed" b/c I'm not really an oenophile). Only mild criticism is I thought one of the red meat dishes was on the salty side--the dish was still delectable, but the salt somewhat overwhelmed the other flavors. It was only one dish I felt that way though.I am 100% coming back
5
Went after a friend recommended we meet there for dinner, he went for the 8 course wine pairing whilst I chose the 6 course without wine. I love the fact that the wait staff did not push too hard for us to both go for the most expensive or insist on the wine pairing, instead their recommendations were reasonable and well founded. May I just say that having dined in several supposed Michelin restaurants both in Singapore and abroad, I would chose Chef's table over most of them. The reason is simple, his team have created delicious, fresh, wholesome food at a fraction of what he should be charging (or rather what other people are charging- don't tell chef!). I kept expecting the next dish to be lacklustre after the oral explosion of the last one but to my disbelief/surprise each held its own! You must understand I went in thinking this was just going to be a frou frou, maybe above average meal. Boy was I wrong. Thank you for an amazing meal, I left gastronomically ecstatic and humbled
5
We came in a party of 6 to celebrate a birthday. The restaurant wasn't too crowded at dinner. We were warmly welcomed. The wine list had a good selection and the staff manager was knowledgeable about wines. We had brought bottles of our own, including two burgundies and we ordered another from the list. Corkage was reasonable, We all had the 8-course menu. Everyone, especially the birthday boy, was happy with the food which was fresh and carefully prepared. The chefs also accommodated our taste preferences and exclusions. I liked the artwork on the walls but I wish the place had more soft furnishings. We sat at the high chairs and high table which made it easy for us to converse with the staff and see what the chefs were doing. However, I was warned in advance that the high chairs also meant that certain kinds of attire might more suitable than others, unless one didn't mind risking "exposure" to other diners
5
Last night we splurged on the 6-course, with wine pairing, dinner at Chef's Table to celebrate a special occasion. It was, hands down, the best meal I've had in Singapore (in nearly 9 years of living here!). The staff were very friendly, helpful and responsive. I'm vegetarian and was worried that would be a problem, but had no issues. The Chef brought out each dish and described what was in it and why. Some items were grown on-site in their own little garden. Everything was beautifully presented and tasted amazing. The wines were also exceptional and paired beautifully with each course. It was a bit pricey for us - with our Eat Singapore book discount (20%) the tab for 2 of us came to about $500. But it was an unforgettable meal and experience. Highly recommended for a special occasion
5
New!!! Check out for Friday's Lunch!!
Every Friday a different 4 Course surprise Lunch, which is as great as Dinner menu.
5
We were treated to a wonderful 6-course dinner with superb food and presentation. Some of the best fine dining we have had in Singapore. Our experience was enhanced by Alexandria, the sommelier who presented the wine pairing selection with each course. There is a lot of passion and love behind their concept

My wife and I visited my daughter in Singapore for her birthday, as she now lives there. My daughter shortlisted two restaurants, that she has not patron before, and my wife picked Chef's table. I did not have any expectation but was pleasantly surprised soon after the arrival of the first two dishes. The restaurant is not big and by my counting, can sit up to around 24 guests comfortably. The two executive chefs work from an open kitchen. They offer you a menu where guest can choose from either 4-course, 6-course or 8-course. The menu also tells you what ingredients that the chefs would use on the day of visit and you would be asked what ingredients that you do not take. Once you have done that, the rest will be taken care of by the chefs. Food is above average and is worth every effort to visit the place. Service is attentive and the chef will come to your table when each dish is served to give a detailed account of the ingredients and how they were prepared. The cost is reasonable with the 6-course menu at S$128. I will definitely go back in the future
5
Food is very fresh. I like the way that we just inform the staff what we don't eat based on ingredients on the menu. You don't know what is coming. The Chef will come over to our table to introduce each dish, how they cook it and where the ingredients are from. Very professional. Service from the staff is also excellent. Very attentive and friendly. Their pdt knowledge on the wine are also good.Definitely worth going back again
5
We had dinner here on a Friday night thanks to the recommendation of a couple of friends who also enjoy dining out, and the experience was absolutely magnificent. Truly recommended: fresh produce, lovely service and a really interesting and creative combination of flavours in a menu where the Chef's skills are centrepiece. They have a good selection of wines to accompany the tasting dinner, with some Austrian varieties that cannot be had anywhere else in Singapore.Not cheap, but considering the quality, the prices are commesurate. I would advise to book early, as the place was full during our dinner
5
It's a surprise what you'll get when you enter the restaurant. You'll be given a list of ingredients the chef has and you just have to tell them what don't you like from the list and your dinner will be served!We had a 6 course meal that night and had gone home with a fantastic experience. The food was fresh and everything tasted so great! The serving speed was just right too! The restaurant has a different kind of feel. We were seated in high tables and could converse with the chefs easily. The tables are not tightly arranged so you can't hear what you neighbors are talking about! It not dark where you can hardly see your food (or date!) but it is just as cozy. This is definitely a place to go for a night out or even for a simple gathering
5
Chef Stephan's idea of having a list of the 28 ingredients that will be used to create the menu is wonderfully creative. The diner chooses to have either 4, 6 or 8 courses and their contents are all created from some of the 28 ingredients. The Chefs bring their various dishes to the table and explain each one. All were delicious! The stand out for us was the Iberico pork then the lamb rack courses. The delightful food was matched with lovely wines and excellent service under the guidance of the Portugese Maitre D. So often in Singapore the service is sub-standard, but happily not at Chef's Table. We thoroughly enjoyed our evening
5
So my Friend found this place during his last Visit so he said we had to go, despite a booking at 6 we came early since he had a flight to catch, and they let us start early, we had the 6 course menu, with some great Austrian wine, was great food, some of the best I have ever had, I love the concept, infact he visited again 3 days earlier by himself and had a completely different menu, great service, felt very welcome will def come again very soon thank u Chef steph !
5
Not exaggerating when I say this is one of THE BEST food I have ever had and my friends would 100% agree. No smoke and mirrors, just quality and seasonal fresh food made with immense love, passion, thought and creativity - you can definitely taste it. And the wines - delicious and perfectly paired with every dish. Service was non-pretentious, warm and friendly - they genuinely want you to know what you're about to eat and drink before you consume it. Chef Stephan Zoisl and Chef Lorenz Raich are some of the most down-to-earth and humble chefs I have ever come across, despite how incredibly and deeply talented they are. It was full house last night and it felt like I was dining with a very big group of friends at home. I would rate this 6 out of 5 if I could. Really. Thank you for a wonderful experience Chef's Table by Stephan Zoisl
5
This is pricey but extraordinary food. Two young Austrian chefs whip up 4, 6, or 8 courses - you get a list of ingredients and can exclude what you don't like, and off they go. Our food was delicious and beautifully presented. Personal favourites included rabbit stew and flaked roasted artichoke. Every course gets presented and explained by one of the two chefs. A place to go on a date or for a special occasion. Our only wishes at the end: a bit more time in between courses. And just because one of us is pescatorian does not mean that every course has to include seafood. One or two purely vegetarian courses would have been just fine too. Regardless, a top dining experience, highly recommended.
5
Great looking dishes that tasted amazing and pleasant service, the restaurant feels very personal. Loved the Austrian Pinot Noir recommended to us. I like that the high chairs give you a good view of the kitchen.
5
We took the four courses dinner and at the 3rd course we were already full but came the dessert... no way to say "NO" . The chocolate with taste of citrus ... I will be back .
5
Great place, very unique to Singapore! Food is amazing, service great and wines perfect.
It's a must go!
5
Our visit at Chef´s Table was for us the gourmet highlight in Singapore. Thanks a lot for your warm and welcoming service as well as your fantastic food. We will recommend your restaurant to everybody visiting Singapore. Thanks
5
This place is simply awesome! We did enjoy another great evening and the staff there simply does a great job as usual! We now visited the third time and the food is just getting better and better - the food quality is honestly the best quality of meats and fish you can get in town - I believe the chefs simply take care of having the best ingredients in there fridge and are passionate about whatever they are cooking - a menu which does change so often is a challenge for the chefs (I believe) and is so highly respected to me as any plate they are serving is another unbelievable experience! We do highly recommend the place - thumbs up! Chefs table IT IS!
5
I took my wife here for her birthday during a wid week evening. The concept is different and the ingredients are varied and top quality. The lady running front of house was welcoming and friendly and explained the process etc. When the food came..... amazing! We went for the 4 courses and will be back again next month for sure.
5
4 of us went for a meal at Chef's Table and found the atmosphere very nice. Choosing what you DON'T want to eat and then being surprised with what you were served was brilliant. The food was some of the best we have ever had, with each course being served by the Chef who prepared it in an open kitchen for all to see. We will definitely go again!
4
The concept of having to select which foods you don't want to eat, is very interesting! It's fun to not know what to expect. The setting was very relaxed, cafe like atmosphere, almost like in someone's house, with a big open kitchen. We didn't get to see the chefs at work, as most of the tables are out at the front of the restaurant. Service was pleasant, and most importantly, the food was excellent. It's on par with the Michelin star guys, in terms of ingredients, textures, taste, presentation, but more easy on the pocket. Definitely a very good address!
2
When I say : may I have plain macaroni with butter only for my boy who is 9 years old. What don't you understand ?When you ask me an ingredient I don't like ? OctopusWhy do you serve octopus in the sauce?I feel like : serve me what you want!!! ( and not what I would live to eat ? 
5
Loved everything about this restaurant.Nice place, wonderful service, loved the interaction with the chefs.The food (we had the 6 course menu) was just excellent, super flavours and colours, beautifully presented.And a very nice wine list.Would give this 6 stars if I could. Loved it
5
great food and nice experience
A restaurant that I highly recommend
Very different dishes with a high standard of tastes
Service was friendly and paying attention to the details
5
Menu idea is great, you won't be given any dish that you do not like as you select the foods you like/dislike from their ingredients list when you order. Highly recommended
5
delicious and beautifully presented food. By Singapore standards, and for artisanal menu, the price was not bad and the Austrian wines recommended to us were very good. Attentive and friendly staff made the experience very pleasant and a lovely way to spend the evening with friends. We will definitely go back and will recommend it to friends
5
My third Visit. Once again a totally different menu... and I think Chef's table is getting better and better. My 2x favorite dishes this time... a strawberry dessert with wild and white strawberries & a goose-liver dish with a type of apricot (medlar). Coming back for sure... will try to keep this a monthly "must visit".
5
We found this little restaurant in the Eat Singapore book and it really was fantastic. There is no menu. Instead, you are presented with a list of daily ingredients the chef's have in that day. You tell the staff which ones you don't want to or can't eat, and the menu is created for you. Either 4, 6 or 8 courses. We had the 6 and thoroughly recommend it.The kitchen is open so you can see the chefs at work, and the chefs serve you every dish personally which is a great touch.The food was superb and so well presented and thought through. We will definitely go back. 5 star fine dining in a back street if Singapore
5
A friend who is a true foodie recommended this restaurant so we decided to give it a shot. We were very impressed. We ordered the 4 courses and not only speck of food on the plate of each dish, was anything but mediocre. Every single course was just spectacular. Truly amazing. Will definitely be back.

My boyfriend had been there back in November 2016 and told me it was his favorite fine dining in the city.We took the 6 course menu. What's pretty cool about this place is that the chef proposes ingredients that he is going to use for the dishes. If you don't like a certain ingredient, you can let them know and they will prepare something else. I wanted to try 2 desserts and they were kind enough to swap one savory plate for a dessert plate. My boyfriend did the same for the cheese plate.My 6 course menu ended up being 3 fish dishes, 1 meat dish and 2 desserts. I wasn't really enthusiastic about the first 4 dishes. The best I had was probably the hokkaido scallop and the duck, but the flavors weren't something I hadn't had before.Dessert was good, creme brûlée and chocolate cake with mandarine sorbet. Again, pretty good but nothing I never tried before. In total, we paid 400 dollars for the meal which I think was expensive. Comparatively, we paid the same amount of money at Rhubarb and the food was, in my opinion, way better.That being said, it's a really nice modern place, with good Austrian wine and really good service. I think it's always trying for yourself but if you had only one evening I would recommend Rhubarb or Whitegrass
5
I was looking for a special place to celebrate my birthday with the girls and a friend of mine recommended Chefs Table.We arrived at this lovely restaurant and sat on large table close to the kitchen, it was a great atmosphere with the open kitchen concept.We ordered the 4 course set menu at $98 and it was exceptional, each dish was innovative and flavourful, true to the chefs Austrian style.The service throughout the evening was great, especially with a group of 10 pretty loud ladies. It was a wonderful evening and we will definitely return
5
Small casual restaurant where the focus is on good produce and excellent food. I love the "no menu" concept and letting the chef decide what to make for you so that each dish is a surprise introduced and explained by the staff. The flavours are wonderful
5
That was my second visit to Chef's Table. I knew that the first time I had no expectations - therefore I was really blown away. The dinner was one of the best I had in Singapore. Now my second visit - I had high expectations as to my understanding Chef Stephan will not serve any repetition/ no signature dishes. So I was expecting new dishes - a total new experience & to make a long story short - the Chef's delivered. I had a totally different menu, very creative & ones again all very well executed. Wine pairing was great & Alexandra (the restaurant manager I got to know a little bit better) has the perfect host. Big thanks to her. Looking forward to dinner 3 soon
5
wonderful service from both front of house manageress and chef, equisite food served in beautifully designed way. food was delicious. no complaints, hard to pick any faults, wonderfully intimate, romantic, nice wines, what more can I say, go! enjoy!
5
We had a great meal and super service. Very interesting concept and great creation of the food. We will come back
5
Excellent and creative food. Liked all the dishes. Superbe service and good athmosphere. Likes the fact that the chef(s) come out and present the food. Will come again.
5
It was simply excellent. Great food plated and served with style. Good ombiance, modern but comfortable. Just the right evening I was hoping for.
5
Love everything about this restaurant. The cool concept and great service.Every dish serve was delicious and fresh. They do not have fixed menu and that makes this place unique. Chef will cook according to the ingredients available and your diet restriction. We took the 6 course and filled just nice. They have a variety of Top notch wine to choose from such as from Austria. Would definitely recommend and would be back. Thank you Chefs and team for the great dining experience.
5
We came from Bangkok and had dinner at Rhubarb. The chef their recommended us to visit Chef's Table - I'm so happy we did! The experience was really amazing. Set in a very artistic and relaxing restaurant with high tables and a super small open kitchen that make some prep kitchens look big!Alexandria greeted and seared us with warmth and sincerity and explained the restaurants concept.To put it really basically, the chef had gone out and sourced a few (28) high quality ingredients and said "that's what we have today" the guest can point out things they don't like and that's it....he will then create a 4,6 or 8 course dining treat. It's fantastic! Each dish is lovingly prepared and then brought to your table by either chef Stephen or one of his talented crew. They explain each dish with passion and flair, you can taste it even before the fork touches your lips.The service was efficient and friendly and the price very reasonable! I was shocked time learn that the chef was down by 2 staff, one of them was his head sous! AND the service side was down by one staff (sick) and one guy was his first day! But to me everything was perfect.Thanks to chef paul at Rhubarb for recommending this place and thanks to Chef Stephen for now giving me 2 favorite places to eat in Singapore!
5
Couldn't fault this restaurant at all. Small restaurant with a great concept. Food delicious and creative, wines very good, a lot of Austrian and German wines. Service was outstanding and the fact the chef comes to the table to explain his dishes is a nice touch. Would highly recommend this restaurant and will definitely be going back. Thank you for a lovely evening

My boyfriend and I decided to come to Chef's Table for our early Valentine's dinner based on strong recommendations from our friends. We arrived at 7:30pm and we were the only ones in the restaurant. It was a Thursday evening, but it is still a bit uncomfortable to walk into an empty restaurant. The hostess seated us and asked if we wanted anything to drink. She suggested one of the Austrian wines on the menu as the chef is Austrian and it would pair well with the first couple of courses. She let us sample the wine first and when we liked it, she poured out a glass for each of us. The glass was barely full, maybe 2 fingers up from the bottom. When we asked as politely as we could if that was the full serving size, she tried to convince us that a standard pour of wine is only 100 mL. This would be 7.5 glasses per bottle instead of the average 4-6 glasses at the vast majority of other establishments. She extremely rudely and repeatedly told us that she would measure it out for us. Finally, she begrudgingly poured maybe 10 mL more into each glass. She then promptly went over to the chef and started complaining about us to him, while pointing and glaring in our direction. For the remainder of the meal she did not say a word to us, not even once did she come over and ask how we were doing or if we needed anything else. Instead she stood an awkward distance away and gave us nasty looks, making us extremely uncomfortable. It was shocking that as the only guests at an expensive restaurant we would be treated so horribly. This woman completely ruined the dinner experience, although the food was excellent, the discomfort that she put us in overwhelmed the quality of the meal. If you would like a pleasant, relaxing, or special dinner experience, do not come to Chef's Table. With so many excellent food choices in Singapore, do not waste your money on a place with such terrible service.

At this "omakase" styled restaurant, the food ingredients that are to be used are displayed upfront and diners get to tell the chefs if there are any items that they do not eat. I understand the ingredients change depending on what fresh produce is obtained. Depending on how hungry, diners can choose 4, 6, 8 courses. Prices are very, very reasonable for the cuisine genre. Wife and I did the 6 course and it was really more than enough, leaving us stuffed (but then again we aren't huge eaters). Food was prepared exquisitely, with innovation and finesse. Most were hits rather then misses, although my wife would have preferred more seafood (but I'm allergic and had to arrange accordingly which may have affected what was prepared for her in turn).I was surprised at how empty the place was though - clearly they need to market themselves more. Also, the wines, while the list is acceptable, are a tad on the expensive side (but then again, this is Sgp).
5
Went to Chef's table with a few friends. Love the concept of omakase, and to see Chefs coming to the table to explain the food and interact with diners.Service is great, small but good selections of wines (we asked for wine pairing to our 6course meal). Place was packed and had a great atmosphere. Place rocks
5
It is an amazing discovery! Great food, smart concept, nice atmosphere! We loved it and will be back ASAP!
5
A dinner which took me through some different flavours, which I would not have thought off but worked out great
This is a must when in Singapore 👌👍
4
Dinner was more than up to expectations and the food was excellent. A little more thought could have been put into the wines for the pairing
5
This Omakase concept is bold as it is innovative. Chef Stephan embarked on his culinary journey, starting at the Iconic Grand Hotel and then spanning all across fine dining establishments in Europe. While he came to Singapore in 2008 to helm the now defunct Novus Restaurant and Bar, he later decided to embark on a food journey that would take him to Michelin-starred kitchens like Heston Blumenthal’s The Fat Duck and Grant Achatz’s Alinea, known for serving outrageously creative food. When you arrive, they will give you a list of items. You will need to tell them if you have any dietary restrictions. After that, you leave it up to Chef to work his magic.Now, the food itself is full of surprises. What you’ll get is some true Omakase style dining that sure to delight. Depending on season, ingredients, preferences and Chef’s choices, you’ll taste something that is meant to surprise you every time. The food is creative, the service is impeccable and wine pairings are well-thought out
5
Omakase is a Japanese tradition where guests are served what the Chef has chosen. In this restaurant you are not limited to Japanese food. You will be treated to new, interesting and rare foods from all over the world. if you want to broaden your knowledge of food then get a table

Nice concept where you are presented with some 30 ingredients and you cross those you don't like.Then the chef will prepare an Austrian-inspired degustation menu with your ingredients. Nice degustation menus, although the portions are rather small (we took the 6 courses menu).Small but nice wine list with interesting options from Austria, amongst others
5
You have a list of ingredients and may choose those you would like to avoid. Based on that the chef will cook SOMETHING CREATIVE in the open kitchen and will explain what it is when serving it! We visited 2 times and every dish was delicious, even deserts which I typically don't like were perfect! Good wine list!The eclectic mix of the restaurant's design, atmosphere and the music in the background - enjoy it even more by seeing all the photos/posters of CHEF on the way to the bathroom! This will explain you m ore about such a mix! :)Best recommendations

My friends and I had our End of the year dinner at Chefs table and I have to say it is not easy to get the 3 important factors when dink g out in Singapore at the same place. Food was exceptional!! Perfect Wines (never knew Austrian wines were so good) and professional and friendly service.Will definitely go back !!

I went to fat cow for my birthday two years ago and I thought nothing could top that piece of top grade beef and the side dishes we had that night. That was until I tried chef's table this year.Being a fan of the netflix series, I had to try it when I learnt about this place and what better occasion than celebrating your birthday there.We were promptly seated upon arrival. The menu was very different. Water was served and food was ordered with the help from the very accommodating server.We went for the 6 course meal. Each dish was characteristically created and they tasted like nothing i've ever had. Every ingredient was married to each other to create a nice complex dish. Every dish taste as stunning as it looks visually.The only disappointment was from the fifth course. It was a duck dish that although I enjoyed very much, it was a little too gamey for my family. Thankfully the dessert was so good, everyone had an unforgettable closure for the meal that night. I'll definitely return and recommend it to my friends in future

These two Austrian are magicians! Hardly seen a place that's so appealing in every aspect - the interior design, decoration, music, seating arrangements... and of course the food. These guys must be thinking about food all day long, about new creations, new tastes, new food compositions.  I totally like the idea of a restaurant without a menu card, just giving ingredients of the day for your choosing (better: exclusion, in case of allergies etc). The rest is the job of the chefs. And they do wonder, every single dish!  I’m also a great fan of the open kitchen concept, watching them how they prepare my food, asking questions, talking to them whilst they cook for me. This is just my place. I could go there every day, could I afford it. But quality has its price, doesn’t matter too much! Great value for money. All thumbs up
5
Had the 6-course meal with matching wine and enjoyed every second of it.
They have a nice choice of wine from Germany and Austria and the food is amazing. Taste explosion
For Singapore it is very reasonably priced - make reservation ;)

Love this place. Great food, well sourced, well executed. Thanks guys. I Will recommend this to my friends, and can't wait to come again

We had a wonderful evening at Chef's Table. Had the 4 and 6 course menu. Each course was served in very nice plate, presentation was perfect and the food was awesome. The meat was tender and tasty. And the chocolate desert so yummy and not heavy. We'll come back!!

Table of 3 on a Saturday night including 1 pregnant women. Chef was kind enough to accommodate the food restrictions. We took 6 courses menu (128$ ++). Food was very good and service as well. Minor comments is that lights could be dimmed a little to create more intimacy and that waiters opened sparkling water without us asking for it (first one yes, but not subsequent bottles. But at least they did not count the 3rd bottle that was not ordered which is very professional). Overall great experience. Will probably go back
5
My 2nd visit this year, enjoyed an excellent evening. Choice between 4, 6 (our pick) and 8 courses. Chef Stephan explained every dish nicely. Any Hobby Chef will value the expert's advice as a bonus. One of the best dinner places in Singapore. Expensive but justitiable by the quality
4
Ingredients are as fresh as can be, and prepared with great finesse and pride. Every dish of the 8-course meal looks and mostly tastes the part. My only suggestion is for them to dial down the salt by a notch or two; the pork, duck dishes and lobster bisque lost their natural flavours as a result. Service is excellent. Be prepared to leave smelling like the kitchen
5
Menu changes daily, and the chef creates dishes using fresh ingredients, no need to look at the menu, just let the kitchen staff do their work. If this is your style of dining and you don't mind spending a few dollars on a nice meal give it a go
5
Such an extraordinary dining experience from the moment you step into the restaurant - allow your eyes to rove around and discover interesting "things" - the sleek, huge open kitchen, unique range of wines, rare whiskeys, indoor herb garden (I love their oyster leaf - ecstatic), ... And then be pleasantly surprised by what the charming Chef Stephan and his team CREATE. Do pay attention to their introduction of the dishes : choice of ingredients, cooking method, etc, and the SEQUENCE for eating ;-) Yep! it's not just a meal - it's AN EXPERIENCE :D Get your cameras ready - you'd want to capture the essence and beauty of all their efforts before devouring what's in front of you
5
The concept is simple, there is no fuss or pretense yet the delivery, taste and experience is superb.Even when the restaurant wasn't full it had atmosphere. The staff are genuine, friendly and knowledgeable. Everything happens smoothly and effortlessly. I suggest you try it. You wont be disappointed
5
Food 5.0Service 5.0Ambience 5.0All over just a unique dining experience. Came back again to this place after a while and was curious if they were able to keep up the standards from last time and actually i was even more impressed then last time. Food was just on the top and the two chefs really are a hack. Thank you for this evening and i will definitely be back
5
I had dinner 3 or 4 times at this restaurant Chef's Table. Each visit was an awesome fine dining experience. I love the concept "Menu based on the arrival of fresh products" .One might apprehend there is limited choice. You only need to specify what you dislike or dietary restrict and let Chef Stephan and Chef Lorenz create your dishes. Discovery and delights guaranteed ! Small appetite may choose 4 course while normal gourmet can go with 6-8 course. You would be surprised..The portions are just right. A large choice of wine to pair with your food. Personalized touch by the friendly Chefs who will provide description of your dish while your mouth is watering. Decor of the restaurant is neat, simple, efficient. Personally, high tables and high stools are not my preferred seats for dining but they are comfortable enough. You come here to indulge your palate and appreciate the art of cooking in the quiet. The set-up is minimalist but nothing is missing. Prices are correct according to fine dining. Hence, Less is More ! Try it out for the difference

I found this lovely restaurant when I was searching online for restaurants with degustation menus as a birthday treat for my husband. What intrigued me was the menu itself: just a list of fresh ingredients placed in a matrix on the webpage, and below a short list stating 4-course, 6-course or 8-course degustation meals with the respective prices. Nothing else. My husband was a little hesitant to try this restaurant as he really likes to know what he's eating. I persuaded him to just trust Chef Stephan. The sommelier, Per, recommended the 6-course menu and paired 3 wonderful German and Austrian wines (two light and very refreshing whites, the last a deep and satisfying red). What can I say - the chefs did not disappoint! Each course was served personally by the chef (either Chef Stephan or Chef Lorenz, depending on who created that dish) with an explanation of the ingredients. My husband says he's never eaten pork so beautifully cooked, so tender and so full of flavour. He was intrigued by the fish and the sauce. He admits that this was the first time he really enjoyed fois gras. He couldn't get enough of the dessert, it was so much better than the piece of birthday cake they served him! He loved the whole eating experience! We were seated (place your reservation early) at a common table with high bar stools but far enough from the other pair not to even overhear their conversation (and vice-versa). Unpretentious and honest decor and ambience. And yes, we will go back there again when we want to treat ourselves to a wonderful degustation experience
3
I went there last Saturday for my wife's belated birthday celebration. I had a 8 course and my wife had the 6 course menu. The décor is simple and casual. I was disappointed with the variety of the dishes since they seem to look very similar but the taste is good. I had expected a wider variety of seafood in the 8 course menu. I had three fish dishes and no other seafood on offer (ie scallops or crayfish) so I recommend to go with the 6 course menu. Overall a good meal for the price but at this price point there are many alternatives
4
Went there as my birthday treat, had such a great time! As this was my first fine dining experience (presume it qualifies), I went in with trepidation that it would be too fancy and we would end up getting out of it still hungry. We had the 6 course and the portions were just right. Food was good and consistent throughout, my favourite part was when the chef came around to explain in great detail about each dish. The atmosphere was laid back and chilled, yet spaced out enough to give a sense of privacy. If there was any feedback to give was that I thought dessert was a little simple - I expected a little more 'wow' factor to it - but nonetheless still good. Thanks for the experience.

This is a concept I've experienced a number of times as I've dined myself around the world; stylish decor, a simple relaxed atmosphere, chefs cooking in full view of the guests, food that looks like art and amazing tastes......but just as the perfect meal can be ruined by a single imperfect component, so can this concept.....But not at Chef's Table! Chef Stephan and his team have combined all of these ingredients with excellent but relaxed service and exceptional wine to produce an experience worth the time and money. Chefs Table is not cheap. We, admittedly, had one bottle more than we actual required (but we were well in the party mood by then!!) and our bill came to $1100 for four of us. The concept provides for a list of seasonal and local ingredients that your host explains will be used to a create 4, 6 or 8 course menu for you (you choose depending on your appetite). We did the eight and every one was a delicious work of art. As each course is delivered, the chef(s) come to your table, explain what they've prepared for you and why they prepared it that way....and you can ask as many questions as you like!! And while two dessert courses may be a tad decadent, even a savoury chap like me could help but finish the lot. Overall a wonderful night with good friends, great food and an excellent time had by all!

Friday dining going for the 6 courses dinner.1st course, i think so-so; dessert is dessert. not my thing but wife was happy. 4 dishes in between, 2 fish, 2 meat were worth the price tag, well plated, creative and original, interesting and tasty. good experience.for each dish, one of the chefs comes out of the kitchen and explains what he serves. good touch.this would deserve the 5bullet excellent score.but...2-3 things are a tad either annoying or to be improved.first, dining happens on stools and high table. no chairs.then the ambiance, well, i prefer silence to a rather loud somewhat pop-y modern music (i am polite. for me, it was closer to noise than anything else).if the chefs are coming and explaining exquisitely plated dishes, the cutlery is before that positioned in a rather careless manner (without going to measuring things, having fork and knife placed gently and parallel is what i expect of good service)last, and most troublesome for me, but i am partial : wine service. no wine menu. the sommelier comes and pretends to chose for me, returns with one-two bottles after few words exchange. some can like it this way and consider it is his job. after all that is what we do with the food there. But i like to chose my wine myself. After two not very satisfying iteration, i elicited to just walk with him on his wine wall and chose myself. ended up to be a bit expensive for 5 glasses. but mostly, my regrets is the first 2 wines i would not have taken if i had been to the wall upfront. lessons learned.net net. i do not regret the culinary experience and would recommend it. the restaurant concept around it ? question

I was recently there with a couple of girlfriends for a bridal shower celebration .Chef Stephan and his team were very welcoming and made our night . Food was superb and beautifully plated . Produces were very fresh . We ordered 4 courses but had to upgrade because it was that delicious ! The ambience was relaxing yet charged with good vibes . Very happy indeed . Definitely would go there again ! One of the best hip restaurant I'd been for awhile .

Our 2nd visit to Chef’s Table, an open kitchen style minimal seating restaurant. A good selection of interesting ingredients and wines, combined to the chef’s special creations.We chose the 6 course menu. Each course was well prepared and presented, but there was an issue with slightly overcooked scallops, which made them a bit too chewy for our tastes. I particularly liked the sea bass with risotto, and the savory Barbary/Muscovy duck was also good.The menu allows all savory choice which I did not choose. Another small but essential detail if you choose the wines by the glass is to ask what’s coming next to match the wine to the upcoming dish, as the courses and win matching was a bit mismatched for my taste. The decor is a bit austere and minimalist. The high chairs and tables are cool casual but no coziness, little comfort (leg rests were a bit awkward for my 1.8m frame) and too bright for intimacy. I think it’s a nice “get to know someone” date place or a group of friends having a good meal outing, but I’d not choose it for a romantic date, which I think Corner House as a foodie romantic venue.I gave an overall rating of Very Good, but in my mind, it’s just good. Even their own website writes “good food, fine wine”. If I seem a bit subjectively harsh, it’s just that in this price bracket, other restaurants like Alma, Beni and Corner House are the competition, and while the cuisine at Chef’s Table is good, the extras like ambience comes into play, and Chef’s Table’s modern open kitchen plan in a bright setting and high furnishing concept isn’t one I personally like. The 2 times I’ve gone would reflect this, whereby there was only 1 other couple dining while the others were groups of 3 or more! Otherwise it’s a solid food choice for the $150-$250 per person range
5
Excellent service, food and especially wine selection from Austria and Germany. Without spoiling the surprise menu, the staff were very flexible in taking out any ingredient we didn't want or like and craeting something wonderful, 6 times/courses. You have a choice of 4, 6, or 8 wonderful courses. Each course is as good as the last and you won't be hungry.We're not dessert poeple, but the deconstructed Black Forest cake was amazing. As was salmon course and foi gras in black truffle. It was all so good.Staff were attentive and it was excellent to have the chefs come and explain each dish. The sommelier was excellent, pairing some interesting wines by the glass with each course. Suggest you order by the bottle if you want to keep the bill down. Wine by the glass adds up.Our second visit, and as good as the first. Definitely recommended and we will return
5
Had a fantastic 8-course dinner at Chef's Table. The whole concept, which really showcases the creativity of the chefs, is very interesting and keeps the diners on their toes. Chef Stephan and Chef Lorenz not only create spectacular dishes one after another, but they also drop by the table to explain every dish in detail. They are also very approachable even during the busiest of dinner services, thanks to the open kitchen concept. The atmosphere and service at the restaurant are equally great -- not to mention the wide selection of beverages.This place became an instant favorite
5
Had a wonderful dinner at Chef's Table to mark our 7th anniversary. Tasted seasonal fresh produce from Europe. Our favorite course was the Foie Gras served with chanterelle mushroom. Excellent and impeccable service. Well done, Chef Stephan!
5
An amazing dining experience!! I went with a group of friends and we all thoroughly enjoyed the delicious and creative combination of ingredients uncommonly used, well explained by the Chefs accompanied by interesting selection of wines.
5
Lovely ambience, be it an individual or group meal. Wonderful experience and food served. Personalized service by the team! Will definitely be back for more!!

I have been to this restaurant several times. They have the most creative menu in Singapore. Chef Stephan never cease to surprise me and my partner with amazing dishes every time we visit the restaurant.Why its worthwhile to dine at this restaurant:1. Element of surprise: The menu offers a range of ingredients and you could tell the service staff which ingredient you prefer/ don't like and the Chef will cook a meal based on the ingredients you choose. I always looking forward to try out my next dish as I wont know how the ingredient is prepared and cook til its served.2. Excellent Services: The staff provides exceptional service, they will recommend you wines that pair with the food and attend to your needs promptly. 3. Great Ambiance: The restaurant has an urban setting with nice music. The atmosphere is comfortable and there is no pressure from the staff or to leave the restaurant after you finish your meal. 4. Quality of Food: Although the price set for the food is slightly expensive.The quality of the food is outstanding, the ingredients are very fresh and I believe it is completely worthwhile to spend the money. (I love their desserts as well)I will definitely visit this restaurant again
5
I've been here a few times and the food never fails to impress. All the ingredients are fresh, and Chef Stephan puts them all together in pleasant and surprising ways. All you need to do is pick the number of courses, decide whether or not you want your meal to be paired with wine, and alert them of any food restrictions. Then you just have to sit back and wait for the team to work their magic. The food arrives beautifully plated, so not only is it a delight to taste but also to see
5
Ordered the 4 course dinner and was so good that we extended the courses.Everytime a great experience with food and service!Been there 3 times and each time was not disappointed! Chefs introducing each courses and presentations are so pretty and drool inducing. Atmosphere casual n cosy while food is a class of its own. Those who like fine food but too shy for formal atmosphere should try this place for the fine dining food and services at a chill n cozy environment with close friends
5
Went there for an amazing bite. The highlight was the creation using the freshest mushrooms. Chef Lorenz explained they where airflown products as right now it would be the high season for chanterelle mushrooms to grow.Everytime I go there I'm excited about the open kitchen concept where you can see how busy they can be... And maybe learn something new We'll come back for sure
5
My wife surprised me with a birthday dinner here on a recommendation from a friend. We went with the 6 course option and were truly blown away. Every single dish tasted amazing and at the end of the evening we could not pick just one favorite as they were all delicious. Initially we were just going to order a bottle of wine but, went with the suggestion to have them pair the wines with the dishes for us and am so glad they did. Each wine was specific to what the chef was creating for us and went with the dishes superbly. Singapore is not known for great service but this place is an exception with organized staff, never waiting for a drink or caught with an empty water glass and the chef serving your course and explaining each part on the plate is simply icing on the cake. Thank you for a lovely evening and we cannot wait to come back
5
me and my friends went back to chef stable after our previous experience.from start till the end amazing again.had white asparagus and girolle mushrooms included in our 6 course meal which are just in season now.Chef Lorenz and Stephan served every course to our table and explained about their magic on the plate.Thanks also to Per for the Wine pairing, made our dinner perfect.see you soon again
5
In my opinion best value for money you can get in singapore!!! and they are extremely flexible and able to adjust to your preferences.Went there for the first time for my Wife's Birthday and we have decided to go for the 8 course menu. Those 8 dishes were just so excellently paired together with the wines they have. The wines are from all over the world but mostly focus on the old world and especially austria and germany. It was a fantastic thing to be able to try most of them by the glass as well. Having said that we went back there for a few times now and it is just simply stunning. my opinion best value for money you can get in singapore!!! and they are extremely flexible and able to adjust to your preferences

Nice ambience, great good and creative dishes, all of it at acceptable prices. The main minus is the service, way too slow.
5
I was invited to a dinner party here in May 2016. I was pleased with the ambience but more impressive was the utter helpfulness of the staff. This was a surprise party for a friend and when I arrived early to help it was to find staff tying balloons and climbing on ladders to put up banners. The wine was crisp and the appetisers were beautifully presented. The chef has taken pains to create beautiful finger foods which were delish and creatively presented. The tuna was fresh and seasoned with a sharp tangy sauce. I had beef for my mains and it was simply succulent. But the bestest was the fantastic dessert buffet presented by chef. The strawberry meringue was creamy and gorgeous. The tirimisu had the right splash of alcohol and choc and was to die for. Highly recommended for all foodies!
4
Well executed dishes with fresh ingredients, great ambience for friends gathering. The mains were good but I weren't really blown away by their creativity or pairing. We had sirloin steak and it was very veiny and difficult to chill which was a disappointment.Otherwise, I love the chocolate dessert, it was superb. My friend has been here a couple of times and said the dishes are truly different each time.
5
What a great concept - simply choose how many courses you want, no difficult decisions and absolutely amazing food. Each course was introduced personally by the chef and presentation was wonderful. All our six courses were absolutely delicious and paired perfectly with a wonderful variety of quality wine. The best meal we have had in Singapore in 6 years! Highly recommended
5
Very nice, new fine dining restaurant! Great concept with excellent execution using seasonal fresh ingredients! You only know the ingredients but not the dish that will be created for you...like dining in the dark but always with excitement!From every single dish that was presented to us, you can easily feel chef Stefen's passion for food and the respect to the ingredients. Excellent presentation shows great aesthetics level! Great wine selection from different parts of the world with Per (their GM) telling you all the difference. You also have the chance to try out different ones until you find a good match!It is a bit of shame that such a great restaurant has few people knowing it...then again, to be selfish I would never want it to be too pack to book a table... (Beef dish looked so good I only remember taking a picture when I was half way through :)
4
When you eat here, you only know what ingredients go into the plates that Chef Stephan creates. Each course is a delightful surprise! One can choose from 4,6 or 8 courses. I would recommend the 6 course meal.Only problem is the music - too loud and more like bar like
5
This was a really fun way to try some fresh, seasonal ingredients. We initially opted for the 6 course menu, but on course #5 two people in our party decided it was so amazing we should upgrade to the eight course menu. The kitchen was amenable, and we were delighted with the additional savoury course and second desert. We added the wine pairing, which was a tad expensive, but the German wines were terrific with the food and something we wouldn't have normally tried. This is not an every-day restaurant, but for a special occasion it's worth it
5
Beyond the interesting concept - you don't pick the dishes, just the ingredients - this place is a really good restaurant for fine dining cuisine. Contrary to many places which tries to be inventive to cover for a mediocre quality, this place combines great and elegant tastes with inventive flavors.We tried the 4 and 6 courses menu. Each dish was really well executed, tasty, interesting and delicious.Service is very good too.Very nice experience. Bravo to Chef Stephan
5
Stephan, Per and their crew are doing magic in this place! There are no other words to describe it. It felt like having dinner with friends that happen to be the best chefs one can imagine. The food, the wines and spirits, the fresh herbs, the ingredients, the explanations, the open kitchen; everything added to a perfect experience. We ended up placing the next reservation before leaving what to us became the best restaurant in Singapore. Thanks again for this magic evening
5
The food presented by Chef Stephen is nothing short of luxurious finish and tastiness. We were very amazed with the oyster leaf that absolutely replicates the true taste of the food that it is named after. Chef Stephen is also very approachable, sharing with us each course and how they are prepared. A must-try for everyone looking to seek for some delicious and mysterious cuisines.
5
Amazing food with great wine selection in a chilled out laid back ambience . The chefs are very friendly and explained every course and its ingredients. Definitely a big fan !
5
Fantastic place! The atmosphere is simple but inviting. The 6 course menu was delicious and the staff very friendly. Will certainly be coming back soon.
4
The presentation, taste and quality of the dishes served in our four course set dinner were outstanding. My client and I thoroughly enjoyed our meal.
5
Went there with some friends last Friday and had a really good time until we received the bill...the concept is actually pretty interesting where you pick from the list of the ingredients the ones that you don't like then you get a surprise menu. The 8 dishes that we got were all between really good and breath taking. Definitively among the most sophisticated food that i ate in the last 10 years. Extremely well made, the wine was between ok to really good. The service was really good, nice people. The only thing that i did not like was that they were playing David Bowie throughout the whole evening, they had no mercy. The bill that we got was pretty exceptional but that was the result of having almost with every course a wine which is an exceptionally expensive undertaking once you consume the wine in a place like Singapore. So basically i really liked the food and would go back for it, maybe i drink a little bit less wine next time..
3
Dinner for two...food was good chef came out to serve & explained his dishes was a good thing as only few restaurants are doing it.Service wise can be improved...Seats...can be pretty uncomfortable after an hour dining on those stools. We ended up wanting to go elsewhere after desserts instead of continuing to enjoy a bottle of Pinot Noir from Austria!Overall still have room for improvements! ;
5
After hearing about his experience (apparently he’s worked in 4 different Michelin-starred restaurants !?!) Chef Stephan Zoisl’s new restaurant was at the top of my to-visit list. I went along with a couple of equally hungry colleagues after a long day of work, since it’s near our office in the CBD. The staff was welcoming, and served us up some delicious, modern comfort foods and beautiful cocktails in a warm atmosphere. We shared the Beef Tagliata, the cheese platter, and one of their specialties - the scallops & jamon, and they were all visually pleasant and scrumptious. Aside from that, I’d say both the gin and rum based Chef’s Concoction cocktails are the must-tries! The open kitchen is also a nice touch, since you can watch the produce (which looks quite beautiful) being crafted right onto your plate. It’s a relatively informal atmosphere, but the food is blockbuster
5
Chef's Table by Chef Stephan is a real jewel in the Tanjong Pagar area. The intimate space opens up to the kitchen, where you can watch Chef Stephan and Chef Lorenz whip up amazing dishes while chatting with them in a relaxed atmosphere. The food is simply amazing - I could eat there every day for a year and I wouldn't get bored thanks to all the innovative dishes the Chefs create. One of my absolute favourites is the Rueben sandwich, but the course menus are what the place is really all about. Chef's Table is a non-pretentious, very relaxed establishment that provides delicious food, tasty wines and great quality whiskeys - all that with reasonable prices. I highly recommend Chef's Table by Chef Stephan Zoisl
5
went to chefs table which is located in the tanjong pagar area last week with my friends.the place was recomeneded by a good friend who is a food lover.i must thank him because the dinning experience we had was just amazing.we all took the 6 course tasting menu.you can choose your ingredients what you want to have for the table.unique concept.and then the magic started.......food presentation and more important taste amazing.the 2 Austrian chefs there will always come to your table and explain the dishes.also service wise top noche.Vanny and Per let us feel like we had dinner a friends place with a warm atmosphere and professional recommendations.i also like there wine list....there is none.you just pick it up from the shelf or ask for assistants.we defiantly will be back soon to try a different dishes of the well priced tasting menu.WELL DONE STEPHAN AND TEAM

We took the 4-course dinner option at $98 per person. Both the appetizers were delectable - tuna tartare and cod fish done two ways. Ingredients were fresh and the taste was subtle.For main course, we were served medium-rare duck which tasted average. For dessert we had a strip of fresh chocolate with strawberries/ice-cream. It was a simple dessert, for want of a better word.The presentation of food is good but not theatrically artistic as you might find in certain degustation menu options. Overall it was a good meal but I wasnt wowed or anything. a solid 4/5
5
We enjoyed a 6 course dinner with the freshest ingredients of the day. It was fascinating to see so many varieties of ingredients presented and ending up on your plate presented differently. The herb garden was a plus! The staff were very patient in explaining the dishes to us as well. Very good experience. Highly recommended
