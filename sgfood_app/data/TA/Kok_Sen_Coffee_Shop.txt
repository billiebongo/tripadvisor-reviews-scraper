Came for dinner and it was delicious. Got here about 630pm and we were able to beat the queue. We had frog, fried chicken, various noodle prawn dishes and greens, all very delicious and generous servings. Food came quickly as well.

One of my favourites Zi Char restaurant in town! Especially like the seafood hor fan and the Yong Tau Foo. Another good choice is the big prawn crispy noodle with gravy!

Taken the claypot Yang Tau Foo, fermented bean fried vegetable and braised pork in onion and black sauce. The food is nicely fried with wok qi! But claypot and pork are salty. Hope the Chef can cut down the salt for his dishes. Dishes are reasonably priced. The Yang tau foo minus the salty sauce is nicely done and savvy. The vegetable is fresh and just nice for taste (not salty). Will try the sweet and sour dish next time. Seen nice from the other table

What a rush to bite into the fried Bee Hoon and be swamped by the wonderful wok hei!Seriously good food with a reasonable price tag.The famous fried fish with bean sauce is done just right (not salty but enough to give a wonderful balance of salty-sweetness)!The cereal prawn is buried in a heap yummy cereal....nice!The other dishes are good too

We planned for a simple dinner after much holiday Xmas eating. Ordered Hor Fun and Sweet Sour pork. The food was not fresh especially the pork. Felt rubbery and recooked. They tried to cover it by adding a lot of red sweet sauce. However the pork felt like it has been kept for a while and recooked again. Quite disgusting.
5
Simple coffee shop ambiance, but packs a crowd, tell-tale signs of a hidden gem. Tried the favorites recommended - the fish soup, Prawn horfun, hacheong kai, 3 egg spinach, crab, bean curd; the food was delicious. Bill for 4 came up to about $140, which works out to be about $35 per pax, rather decent pricing considering we were all stuffed
4
It's a local coffee shop that sells Chinese food (Tze char). On the plus side, it's definitely slightly cleaner than you would expect for hawker food. If you have a party of 2 you might be expected to share, but they seem to have ample large round tables for customers to sit and have dinner. On this trip we had the black bean beef hor fun; it was salty and delicious. We also had the dried chilli frogs leg which was very, very nice. The frog legs were crisp on the outside and nice and tender on the inside, and it went well with our hor fun and Tiger beer. Quite affordable as well. Will definitely go back again
3
Dropped by as friends wanted to. Reached at 6pm to avoid the queue. The female server was politeWe got some of their specials - yong tau foo, prawn hor fun, prawn paste with chicken skin, and fried fish. I'm sure there are many fans, as the queue gets long after 615pm, but it's just ok for m
5
This place is very crowded during peak hours and you will be lucky to find a seat. But it is worth the wait as the food is very good. Price is on the higher side compared to other coffee shops. Service is so so as it is crowded
4
This place is heaving. Itâ€™s not the most comfortable dining experience - expect noise, cramped seating, plastic tableware and to be hot and sweaty. The food is made fresh and comes out steaming hot. You can taste the wok. The omelette was the highlight as well garlic stir fry kale. The crispy prawn noodles were pungent and bursting with flavour. S$100 for 4, including drinks. Come early to get a table without having to line up.
4
Food was great and recommended to try. However, expect to queue as this place is popular with the locals. Price is decent as well.

Though Kok Sen Coffee Shop serves cooked dishes in the traditional coffee shop setting, the efficiency of the service shows that it will be more ideal to go elsewhere if you wish to try out traditional Chinese cooked dishes food.Placed a table reservation for 6 pax for a friend's farewell dinner. When only 5 could show up, the staff told us that we have to share a table with 2 strangers. Not only did it lacks privacy, but also a sense of intrusion which spoils the experience. Adding on to the poor experience, our food only came to us one hour after we have place the order. We ordered egg foo-yong (stir fry egg with onions and shrimps), bittergourd soup, stir fry spinach with three eggs (white egg, salted egg and century egg) and roast chicken. All came except the roast bird, which two tables of guests came later than us were given their share of roast chicken first. Taste rather normal and nothing worth raving about. When we inform the staff that our roast chicken has failed to arrive after 90minutes, the staff had a dispute with the cook in the kitchen after we cancel the order. Not necessarily you will see such a good service after being awarded with some pretentious award from the Europeans. Be warned that the waiting time can easily go up to 2 hours on peak period if no reservation is place with them

This is a place I patronized as a kid when it was still operating at the corner coffee shop on the same street but stopped going for many years due to the long queue and limited parking lots.For more than 20 years, this place still packed in the crowd even on a weekday night and the dishes have also increased tremendously. What is always a must order for us is their Braised Black Bean Paste Fish Chunks with Vermicelli which stays as a family favorite and it never disappoint.Waiting time is mixed as on one occasion it was very fast despite the crowd so the reviewed below are difficult to judge.What is worth mentioning is that after not been here for ages, the lady boss is still as friendly
5
Went here for dinner last night with some friends. Cool old style Chinese restaurant/coffee shop. The place was buzzing and packed and we were lucky to get a table. Our friend ordered a number of dishes. There are many complaints about service and wait times here however our food came out quite quickly so we had no issues. The food was absolutely delicious and a great evening had by all.
1
In buzzy and hip Keong Saik we were really glad to see (as long time Singapore visitors) that old school Chinese restaurants were still there and doing well. So with high hopes we grabbed a table at around 845 Saturday night; looking for a meal that would take us back to those places we remembered from way back in Chinatown. At 945 we had a plate of fried rice slapped on our table. At 10 a pork dish arrived. At 10.20 we asked for the bill as our third dish was nowhere in sight. No problem and no mention of that missing dish (we didn't pay for it). The food? Average at best. Very very disappointe
4
I am giving this review a good rating.We ordered what almost every table did i.e. (1) big prawn hor fun with excellent wok hei, (2) prawn paste chicken consists of parts mainly breast which was too salty and not the parts we fancy and (3) sambal fish slices with heaps of dried shrimps. Somehow didn't have the feeling that we will return to dine again
1
Service here is easily what makes this a one star venue. No seats indoors, gestured to go outside, pushed to purchase beer if not then tea. Dishes were like a lucky dip, staff would bring a dish out ask each table if they had ordered it. We received the wrong dish as the waitress was taking it back mumbles how she hoped we hadn't ate it. After about one dish had been served they tried to get us to pay the bill. Overall staff were abrupt if not rude, food was okay... but honestly it's certainly not worth looking for nor the Michelin associatio
4
I have tried many tee char places but always end up being happiest at Kok sen. Very reasonable prices and good portions. My favourite dishes here are the young Tau foo, the har chiong gai, the roast pork kailan and their bitter guord with beef! Yummy
4
We went here for dinner. The place was packed and they set up a table in the back alley, it was awesome. The chicken and veggies were so yummy. I'm not sure what I ate but everything was so good. We ordered about 4 dishes and shared
1
The service is beyond awful for being published in the Michelin guide in 2016 and it should be removed in the 2017 guide! We had to wait nearly an hour plus to be seated, but we had hoped that it would be worth the wait. We then had to wait another 1 hour for the first dish to be brought out and by the time the last dish came out, we had been at the restaurant for nearly 3 hours. They have far too many tables to be able to cope and manage properly as well as the ability to serve the huge crowd. The staff adopted a "don't care" attitude and were frequently rude and insensitive.The staff also didn't know or didn't communicate amongst themselves if the food or drink items were in stock or out, its pretty amazing that we had to order a simple thing like drinks, over 3 times! Firstly no barley, they only told us when our drinks didn't arrive by 20mins then secondly no lime juice when we asked them 15 mins later and finally after all the frustration, we just ordered chrysanthemum tea. The food served was also extremely salty and though the quantity was sufficient, the presentation and the ambience is no longer there
5
This is a busy place, very popular with locals. Food is very good. I had a big prawn mee soup and it was delicious; full of flavour and spicy. Portions are huge! Good value for money.
4
.........and not a coffee shop. Very popular with locals, great food if a bit primitive. You shouldn't care. We enjoyed our meal immensely and its very inexpensive. Great experience!
5
Saw this in a Michelin listing/blog. We weren't disappointed. Very good food! And cheap. Going back for more on our next trip.
1
We were a large group and ordered all their famous dishes. I was looking forward to the chicken with prawn sauce but it was very salty. The sweet and sour pork was the only dish I found ok.
3
I have been eating at Kok Sen for ages. Following their award as a Michilin de Gourmand, I skipped this joint for some while until recently when I had my regular gourmet group gathering, for dinner. All of us are Kok Sen regulars and what a disappointment it was for us. Nearly all items we had that night were not up to mark and this include their Big Prawn noodles, Fish Head curry, Pork Ribs bitter gourd in black soya bean sauce and their Yong Tow Foo. We even left some food uneaten which was never the case in the past. We have decided that, as they are now catering to a different clientele as we see many other colour hair customers, we should no longer make this our regular gathering place. It's sad as over the last 10s of years, I have always enjoyed this homely cook food joint and the image is now completely unacceptable
1
The service is beyond awful. We waited nearly an hour to be seated, but hoped it would be worth the wait. We then had to wait another 1 hour for the first fish to be brought out and, by the time the last dish came out, we had been at the restaurant for 2.5 hours. They have far too many tables to be able to properly serve this number of customers. The staff don't care and were rude.The food was actually pretty good (other than the cereal prawns, which were horribly greasy). But waiting 2 hours for pretty good hor fun, pork and veggies? Certainly never again
4
This place is packed by the lunch crowd right after the CNY. We had to share a table with another two customers. The signature dish of prawn hor fun does not disappoint but I would recommend to order a small size for two rather than the mid size which costs twice more at $32
5
I've been coming here for almost 10 years now and this place made the 2016 Michelin Guide for Singapore. It has always been a popular restaurant for "Zi Char" or cooked dishes with rice. Try their bittergourd pork ribs, roast chicken and their vegetable dishes. I love them all. Prices are very reasonable in expensive Singapore.
5
Been here 3 times, I don't want to miss going everytime I'm in Spore. Prawn paste fried chicken is the number one reason I'm here, but I also love the black bean hor fun!!! Just order those two dishes, and fried rice, that's more than enough!! Satisfying, good taste, incomparable!!
2
We were here on a weekday 8:30pm and shared a table with a couple which we didn't mind. After all, this is an old time coffee shop, boisterous, noisy, full of diners. Good experience if you haven't been to such a place before.Service is fast, and friendly ("the servings are large, don't order more") which we appreciated.Prices are reasonable, but the food we had is a let-down. The big prawns crispy noodles, and the beef with kailan were tasty at first few bites, but both are way, way too salty. So we did not finish either.We had to drink a lot of water that night.. for me, it is a miss.
5
Go early otherwise it gets crowded. Yong dow foo served in claypot is one of our favorites. If you like aubergine they do this dish with minced pork.
4
Try the big Prawn Hor fun! The food was very tasty, and also decently priced. The black pepper beef was excellent too!
4
One of the last traditional coffee shops along Keong Saik street in Singapore. This street used to have a ton of old world charm with traditional eateries and shops; these have been overrun by swanky (expensive) cafes, restaurant offering poor quality food. Kok Sen stands out with its traditional frontage and seating as well as its wok-cooked food that remind its patrons of what quality food at reasonable price is. All the traditional stir fry food are available but try especially its vegetables fried with fermented beancurd and hor fun. A great value for money! Excellent place for traditional fare
5
Since making it into the Michelin guide, this family style restaurant has seen many, many people come here. If you want to eat here, be prepared to queue, hover around almost finished diners, or just come early. They don't take reservations.The food is excellent chinese style family cooking. Sticky pork ribs, steamed minced pork with salted vegetable, fish head curry, spicy prawn noodles, ginger fish slice. Very, very, tasty! Definitely come here in a big group so you can order as many dishes as possible. And for Singapore, this place is very affordable. There is no air conditioning or fancy bits here, just come for the great food
3
We came for lunch one weekday at about 1:30pm and immediately got a table. However we were told that it will be a long wait for food to be served. So make sure you have your iphone/ipad etc to occupy yourself. We ordered the famous Yong Tau Foo and big prawn hor fun. Both were quite tasty, but also quite salty and very oily. I don't think I will recommend anyone here. The prices are not cheap and there are better food elsewhere
5
Fantastic place for friends and family.However, if u have kids with u, I suggest you give them a light snack before going as you'll be waiting for quite some time for your food. Don't miss the ever popular Yong Tau Foo in a claypot, prawn kuey teow and beef kuey teow.If you're going for lunch, get there just before 12 and you're fine, but if you're 5 mins later, call your boss and tell him you'll be in late after lunch. Prepare for food coma after your fantastic meal.
5
Kok Sen's won a bib in Michelin 2016 Bib Gourmand. Not that it matters, as the food never needed to prove itself. This time round, we tried the superlatively good curry fish head, done with a fresh red garoupa. Just enough fire, without being overwhelming. The prawn paste rolls were pure prawn without any prok fillers. Divine
4
We were recommended by a seasoned foodie and trusted her when she said you needed to be there best by 6pm. We arrived at 5.30pm and there were tables which had already finished. As adviced, we did our research beforehand and promptly placed our order for their popular dishes; yong tau foo, prawn paste fried chicken, big prawn hor fun and a simple veggie dish. The portions were well balanced and so tasty that we had no problems cleaning our plates. Kok Sen delivers on taste, efficiency and it is certainly a reflection of the authenticity of local Singaporean food. Definitely would visit again and recommend to friends
5
Kok Sen is run by Hong Kong Cantonese, and follows a dai pai dong format with customers seated on stools around formica tables in the restaurant or on the pavement outside. There is no air conditioning, so don't wear you finest evening clothes. You need to get there early or be prepared to wait for a table. The food is authentic Cantonese Chinese, and tastes fantastic. The bitter gourd spare ribs, and big prawn noodles are well worth the trip to Singapore, and prices are very reasonable
4
Make no mistake, this is not a restaurant for the fussy eater who likes immaculate surroundings and a a quiet atmosphere. This place rocks, with diners and would-be's queuing at the door waiting for a table to come free. Some wise people book in advance, but others just arrive and hope it won't be long before they are seated. The restaurant is too large rooms, but when it's busy, tables crowd the footpath. We enjoyed our meal and wish we had room for more. The dishes delivered to neighboring tables looked and smelled wonderful. Eating here is an experience. try any of the prawn dishes
4
Love the food here. Must try the 月光河, fried kuey Teow, 釀豆腐, tou-fu, 滑蛋河, and many more !!! Personally, I think the 月光河 is authentic, it's fried kuey Teow together with prawn, squid, meat...
5
Super simple interior, plastic cutlery, but
AWESOME food!
All the dishes are very tasty.
The black pepper crab is killing!
The owner (or the managing person) was really welcoming, the service is fast.
Not so many tourists.
1
But after waiting 40 mins for my simple Beef Hor Fun that never turned up... I just paid for my drink and left... Don't bother unless you come on a full stomach cos you'll go hungry waiting
4
Nice and reasonably priced. The CNY set menu was reasonably priced and dishes tasted good too. Try calling for reservations if you are heading there with a big group.
4
I had been to the restaurant 3-4 times with different group of friends. Generally the food is good. However, I will not come here often because I found(or feel) the amount of MSG used is a lot. I cannot stop myself kept drinking of water and even when I reached home I still continue to load with more water to wash away the after taste.I love the big prawn horfun and is much better than war-tan-hor(normal egg gravy hor fun). Other signature dishes like yong tou fu, curry fish, braised ribs with bitter guard(this is so good, no bitter taste from the vegetable) and etcFor seating, try not to sit near the kitchen as that will be really warm. Along the alley will be great if there is no rain or best in the restaurant itself
2
Been here a few times and it is familiarity breeds contempt for me as I m finding the food oil and salty esp. their big prawn noodles, Yong tow fu, fried prawn paste chicken and fried bitter gourd with pork ribs (too small the cut ribs) Altogether not a memorable experience where I paid $92 for the 4 dishes. If i were, I rather spend my monies in the Chi char in the neighborhood for less costs.The problem w the reviews is over generous rating result in hype with people believing this is good when it is average of below for many of the dishes. All that said, I prefer to go Smith street food court and get better value for my bucks Rather surprised it s always full at lunch times, having been here does not automatically make good. They may well be outdated with more discerning tastes of diners.
4
Be there early as the tables get occupied fast. We had the the steam fish tail which was done just perfect. The frog legs with ginger was also delicious and top out with fried green vegetable with preserve bean. There was only 3 for lunch so was not so exciting. Go with a bigger group so can order more
4
Busy place and not the most comfortable seating and service but food definitely delicious. Especially the frog legs, the pieces were big and juicy. The prawn Kway teow is the famous dish there. Although they said small size serves 1, I suggest you order that so you get to try other food. The tofu with minced pork was well cooked and generous in portion. The lime plum juice slightly on the sweet side but still quite good. (After the ice melts)
4
I don't know what the English equivalent of 'zi char' is, but it's no matter. This is as authentic Singaporean Chinese cooking as it gets. Come try the hor fun, har jiong kai and ask for the chef's specialties.No chance of a good parking space, or even a table, if you're late (say, 7pm).Someone's review has it that this is at a red light district. That's incorrect - the street had been an RLD decades ago, but no longer. The tired, old occupants of the last moribund brothel solicit only after all the shops have closed, e. g. 1am.This is a terribly safe area in a ridiculously safe country. Bon appetit
5
An absolutely unimaginative menu, but done to perfection. No fancy fusion experimentation, just fabulous old school Cantonese fare. Just realised that all 3 dishes I ordered were prepared with preserved condiments, thus the umami bomb! Must tries - Yong Taufu and Prawn Paste Chicken. Don't forget to ask for the belachan which gives a beautiful smokiness to the dishes
4
Hawker food indoors is always a delight and Kok Sen does not disappoint. Cannot miss the superb prawn noodles bath in a belachan stock!
4
The food was amazing and portions massive!!! We went late at night so didn't have any problems getting seated. The food was simple but so tasty!! Recommended.
4
The Chinese food here is tasty and authentic. The Yong Tofu claypot is a must! However, I was sorely disappointed by the chili crab, billed as one of their signature dishes. It was expensive (about US $50), but it was quite small, and the chilly sauce was overwhelmingly gooey (like glue) and sweet. I couldn't taste the crabmeat because of the sauce---a huge letdown for that kind of price
4
my friend took me to this place, because she read that this place is have delicious food.so they order (for us) pork sweet and sour : the meat is tender and the taste is very nice. Pork belly with kailan : the taste so rich with local taste. fish head saute with black pepper : i didnt recommend this, because i cant find the nice value, too much bone. scramble egg with prawn taste is just so so, the most delicious one is prawn with the veggie and pour with the soup(i dont know the name) this one is sooo recomende
4
I am staying nearby the food is really delicious and price reasonably. Be prepare to wait even when ordering take aways. Love their signature yong tau foo, prawn soup noodle, dried curry fish and sliced fish bee hoon. They start serving dinner from 5.30pm and rest on alternate Monday
5
First visit for me even though I'm local and this place is pretty well known The food here is amazing. The prawn noodles here is out of this world! Slightly spicy, with a hint of lemon grass, this is a Singaporean/Malaysian prawn noodle dish with a Thai twist. The har cheong chicken was also crispy and delicious and the frog legs with bitter melon in bean paste was also good. Wait was a little long but if you're not hungry, it's worth it
5
On our first night in the area we had a wander around and came across this place which was packed - full of locals, and holidaymakers. It is cheap, cheerful and fairly basic but the food is just amazing. I ordered a particular prawn dish which they didn't have but the waiter recommended a dish called big prawn hor fun - WOW!! There were prawns, greens and thick noodles (that's the hor fun bit) - it had a lovely sauce, it was spicy and chilli hot - it would have to be one of the best things I've ever eaten. We also had some fried chicken, I wish I could remember what it was called .... it came with a hot dipping sauce - another fantastic dish. Most of the dishes come in 3 price ranges depending on how many there are in your group. I can't remember how much the food cost but it really was super cheap. We even ate there the next night (after walking around chinatown) but decided the food was just too good not to eat there again
4
If you want to try something other than a hawker centre, then a cafe like Kok Sen is the next step up. We now eat here on every trip to Singapore and always, always, order way too much! Servings are HUGE even with the smallest size so take this into account. It's easy enough to get a seat if you get here before 7pm at night or 12pm in the day. Otherwise be prepared to wait. Note that tables are all shared so don't be shy. Menu in English with numbers is helpful. At busy times service can be quite slow, and dishes will arrive one at a time instead of all at once. Settling the bill can be a challenge but everyone is good humoured when faced with overeating westerners!! I really love this place
5
If you want a great local meal in Singapore with the true local experience you can't go past Kok Sen, you won't be able to miss it as there will be a queue out the door - don't be shy or you will never get a table!!The "Special" chicken that is only available on Friday and Saturday nights is worth it... All the food is great - they are really busy though so if you want service just wave your hand in the air!!Definitely worth a visi
4
Went on a Sat night at about 5.30pm for the 1st time, and half of the seats are taken. Not sure what to order, so asked for signature dish. Many was being recommended but we ordered Hor Fun with egg - delicious and we like the 'wok hae' taste, the fish belly rice noodle with milky soup and lard was piping hot with generous serving of fish at S$6 per bowl, ordered their braised Liang Dou Fu'' in claypot - rather good if you eat with rice due to the gravy but felt a bit too pricey for $14 for 9 pcs (3 each for red chilly, green bell pepper and eggplant), another green vegetable fried in fermented tofu was good and refreshing. The bittergourd with pork ribs in black beans was equally tasty but lukewarm. Overall satisfying, so we went back 2 nights later and we ordered the same Hor Fun, Fish belly rice noodle soup and rice noodle - all were piping hot, tasty and cost us S$20 inclusive of drinks for 3 pax. Do RSVP or you need to wait. Go early like 5pm or after 9.30pm. Will go back to try other dishes
4
i like the local zhe char food served and the ambience of the local coffee shop. i like the local coffee taste
5
This low key restaurant has one of the best Chinese food i have ever had. Their sweet'n'sour pork, beef with ginger and onions, steamed fish tail and all veggies are phenomenal!
1
Friends stated the food is nice..So went over and no place to sit..Aunty ask to sit at table at back lane..Then ask aunty if can move table a bit..Told me off with attitude..and say "If want to eat then just sit if got table." What the heck..It's like telling me that I got good business..I don't even give a damn if you want to patronise..So I just walk off without eating..Is setting table behind back lane even legal in Singapore?It's so dangerous as there were motorcycle parking and motorbikes will just pass your table by that tiny back lane..Will never ever go back to that place even if the food is free...Hope the authority will just catch these business people that don't care of the customers safety.
4
Great food. Might not be as chic as the surrounding cafes and designer shops but well worth a visit. The food is why you would come here and the surroundings are basic and unpretentious. Don't expect the waitress to understand you if you only speak English. It's a case of having to point to the pictures on the menu but you won't be disappointed
4
Great tasting old school singaporean Chinese food made fresh to order. Lines are long but worth the wait. The beef hor fun is the stand out dish but everything else tastes pretty far good as well.Try going just before noon or after 1:30pm to avoid lunch crowds
4
Kok Sen Restaurant is a tradition coffee shop restaurant, uniquely Singapore. It offers traditional Singapore chinese dishes, like bittergourd fish slices, sweet sour pork chop, fuyong eggs, etc. The restaurant is housed with a traditional coffee shop along Keong Siak Road in the Chinatown vicinity. The food is tasty and the price is reasonable. You should expect to pay $30 per person.

If i could, i wouldn't even rate this place 1 star. Totally negative experience. Made a reservation for my group of 6 friends a week in advance. Got there 15mins before reservation time and was made to wait 45mins and we still weren't seated because we were told to wait for another table of customers to finish eating, then we would take over their table. During this whole time, we witnessed a group of regulars who had tables setup for them along the road while we were waiting for so long! One lady from that table looked very appreciative for being served immediately and the server told her it was because she is a regular, but told her not to say it so loudly since there were many other groups of people who made reservations not seated. Just when the customers of the table we were assigned finally finished eating, a server directed another group of regulars there. We said we already waited for 45mins for that table, that group insistd that they were also promised that table.Seriously, why is there such poor communication between all the servers? They cannot remember who they "promised" the tables to because they do not have a proper SYSTEM in place. Then why bother to take reservations if they overbooked the whole place?! So many other groups were waiting and all made reservations, not just us!My group of friends had not met for such a long time and we were really looking forward to having a simple meal and lohei. We travelled all the way to Kok Sen, most of us left work early in order to make it for the reservation time. Utterly disappointed with the service. This horrible place can survive on business from their regulars for all we care. At the rate they are going, they are not going to get any more new and satisfied customers.If you were wondering, WE LEFT immediately - obviously. We would all rather starve to death than become this place's paying customers

Was meeting a friend nearby and decided on local food rather than all the fancy dandy food around the area (potato head, burnt ends et al)This is an unassuming zi char stall but they had a decently produced menu. I ordered the typical fare - claypot Yong tau foo, fried omelette and sweet and sour pork. The latter was unusual and not cooked the same way like elsewhere. And it was not bad$37 for 2 people , and the young servers all spoke crisp English and Chinese
4
A very decent tze char that serves above average food. Place is a coffeeshop with back alley seating so it does remind one of dining in Malaysia. Be early or else be ready to wait for a table. The signature dishes are the prawn noodles soup, bittergourd fish head, etc. Its worth coming back for simple home cooked meals done with flair
4
Remembered my first visit to this "Zi Char" in 1998. At that time the shop was still at the u-shaped corner a few doors away. This shop is known for their fish soup, fish bee hoon soup and fish Fried Kway Teow. Specially loved the fish belly slices, thick sliced and generous. During the most recent trip, did not manage to try the fish belly slice again, as it was not available. Tried their other popular dishes such as Big Prawn Hor Fun, Beef Hor Fun, Crispy Noodles and Stir-Fried Fish Head with bittergourd in Black bean sauce. The Beef Hor Fun and Stir-fried fish head were excellent. The stir-fried fish head goes well exceptionally with beer. The crispy noodles was not too well done that day. The popular big prawn hor fun is not great and overpriced. The place was very crowded that night and we waited for extremely long for our food
4
had the Ee Mee and it was amazing. tasted spicy and good. we paired it with greens cooked in fermented bean curd. it was all very yummy.
5
Never stop to amaze me this place that is tucked away in Chinatown. Must try the BOG PRAWN Hor-Fun or Deep Fried noodle.
5
A must try is the fried kway teow with big prawn and chili crab sauce....really yummy.
Fried bittergourd was nice too, try the coffee pork ribs
4
Will come back to taste other dishes, overall it is a good experience. I liked the prawn soup but some friends commented it was salty. Fo rong egg was nice. Price is avg, not your most expensive . Worth the trip and please come early for dinner, anything after 630 it will be crowde
3
Friends described food here as near as Malaysian style esp with its yong tou fu and big prawn noodles.My verdict is it' s good the 1st time but after 3rd time, the novelty ran out. Here are my grouses and praise.Grouse: big prawn (sang har) noodles was too spicy - you may need them to reduce chili as a good big prawn noodle should be devoid of heavy spices/chilli.Yong tou fu (stuff toufu) was great the 1st time around but if you have tasted Malaysian Ampang or madras lane yong tou fu (in KL) , this is not even the real McCoy.Positives The prawn paste chicken is not bad as well vegies (green leafy type) on soup.The place is stuff (not air con) but still draw a full crowd at peak hours (dinner or lunch) so you have to stand in line. Better try and come before dinner time For the price i paid i should have not brought my expectations along (note this has received good reviews in the press). Don t forget to ask for less chilli for the prawn noodle

Every visit to Kok Sen is an exciting culinary experience. I've been here on numerous occassions and have always enjoyed the food and atmophere. It'll be helpful to read chinese as they have their specials pasted on the wall, speak & understand cantonese to have a lively banter with the "Ah Jie" (head waitress). Food is good, worth the wait. Two thumbs up for; beef horfun in black bean sauce. Prawn paste chicken. Claypot yong tau foo. Bittergourd porkribs or fish head. On my last visit a week ago, we tried the deep-fried bull frog. Delicious! There's so much to savour, you'll need to make frequent visits to fully experience possibly the best cze char in town

I've been to Kok Sen on quite a number of occasions. The food is pretty good but can be a tad salty at times. Do remind them to go easy on the salt if you need to. In my case, I've got my elderly parents who need to stick to a low salt diet.Our favorites have always been the fish head curry, the hor fun, the prawn paste chicken, the clay pot yong tau foo and the sliced fish stir fried with bitter gourd and black bean sauce. All these dishes are very well cooked and the quality has always been very consistent.What I hate about the place? It gets very crowded and stuffy, especially if you arrive during dinner time which is around 6pm to 8pm. It does get a bit irritating, your food's finally arrived after a significant wait and you're trying to have a family meal and there are strangers waiting for you to be done and standing behind you. At times you do get seated near the kitchen or prep area which is right near the toilet. I guess the better seats are along the back alley, which gives it a whole different feel to it, like you were dining in Malaysia or Vietnam. It is a little cooler as well so do try and request for seats outside of the restaurant if you can.Other than that, no complaints, food's good and that's more important. Wouldn't miss it though so if the place is too crowded when we arrive, we always head off to other equally good places nearby

Been here twice for take away spanning around half a year apart:1st time, ordered: 2x beef hor fun2nd time, ordered: 1x beef hor fun (friend wanted it. didn't order it because its was good before.) 1x cereal squid 1x prawn paste chicken 1x big prawn crispy noodlesboth times, it was almost an hours waiting time.somehow, it seems the waiting time was due to them wait/batching the cooking.later ordering customers already finish their food before i received all my take away items.so some of my take away items are flat cold and some hot while i received them.food was not very good (based on 3 different taste buds).and on the second time, my friends and I all ended up with diahorrea after eating.on the overall, I ban myself from buying take away from this shop again.I would look somewhere els

We are a regular of this "zi char: place for a no. of years. I simply adore the fish belly cooked with bittergourd and black bean paste. The claypot yong taufu is equally good, not forgetting the claypot chicken. Today's lunch for 3 comprised spinach egg soup, claypot yong taufu, fishhead fried with black beans sauce and bitter gourd and kalian with garlic! Simply delicious if not for the mixed-up order by the forever cheerful pine-sized lady who takes orders daily! The restaurant was already very crowded just after 12 noon! Only parking is always a major setback

My bro in law introduced this outlet to us. Everything here is yummy which I didn't believe before i ate it. I think it's because the cook has a lot of years of experience therefore he is able to handle the fire very well! The only thing is it is jam packed during meal times. So if you need a big table for more than 4 pax, better make reservations. The yong tau foo and frog's legs are also yummy but always sold out. So do try to come early. We waited pretty long for the food to be served but i guessed it's normal as it was really crowded. For 7 adults and 1 child, our total bill came up to about $130 for 6 dishes of big size
