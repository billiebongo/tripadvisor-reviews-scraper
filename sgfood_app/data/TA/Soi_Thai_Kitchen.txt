Authentic taste. Love the deep fried fish, egg and tom yam soup. There was nothing Thai about the pork dish we ordered. Overall, enjoyed a good, spicy meal with the family.

You should try pineapple fried rice, gri pork neck and clear tomyam soup. If you've got no idea what to eat, pls approach the staffs and they will explain you well bcos most of them are thai people.

Prawn cake is just so so. Brazil pork too salty. Tom yam soup not spicy at all. Fish is surprisingly not fresh selling at $23.

Cheap and good Thai dishes (Clear Tom Yum soup, Basil Chicken, Yellow Curry Seafood, Belachan Kangkong) and sweet items (Thai milk tea, Chendol) served promptly and fuss-free. Simple interiors; fairly orderly. A place for a quick simple meal. Bill for three persons: 48sgd.

Have eaten here more than five times, and regularly take out food for my son.
The menu offers variety. Basil chicken and seafood curry are our favorites.
Friendly waitstaff, and prompt service.
Filling meals for less than 10sgd per person.

Price is reasonable and fast service. No service charge and gst. Highly recommended. I would certainly visit again. Authentic thai food, prepared by thai chefs...

My first visit there was literally soiled when I reached into their box of cutleries & pulled up half a dozen soiled soup spoons one after another. What made it worse was when I highlighted this to the staff, she nonchalantly waved towards me to another set of cutleries without any apologies nor embarrassment. Never again will I set foot there. There are many Thai alternatives in Gardens.

We ordered two varieties of fried rice and assorted dishes. The food was satisfactory but do mot expect 100% authentic thai cuisine. The morning glory (kangkong) in bean paste was a disappointment...the leaves were fried and just too mushy. You must try the fried fish cake (4 pieces)which was freshly fried. The pork neck is a must try as the meat was tender and "bouncy". See photos of the food ordered. Overall, I would consider it a good dinner place

Dinner for two saw us chomping and repeatedly saying how authentic the Thai Style Seabass, the clear Tom Yum soup, the Thai Style Kang Kong are. Annnnd, the grilled pork neck dish was really out of this world with the right balance of fat and meat - so tender and fragrant - a must. The only disappointment was the Red Ruby dessert - as the coconut was compromised - if only they used fresh coconut milk like the very yummy 'hot' glutinous rice roll with perfect fresh chilled mango and rich coconut milk (well it tasted that). It was the most satisfying Thai meal which ended with a refreshing icing cold Lemon Grass drink. All for only S$68 - no service charge, no GST.My second visit within 3 days saw me ordering 8 dishes for 3 of us. The Squid dish, if you believe, is tender (not like rubber-band) - so perfect. The Pandan Chicken was just ok.My third visit just this past Sunday saw me ordering 11 dishes - but this is for 5 adults and 2 kids. The highlight, again the pork collar and fried chicken skin that got wiped off the plate very quickly before the other dishes were served. Most of us didn't enjoy the (coconut white) Tom Ka soup (a miscommunication during my order). Otherwise, the meal was again, very satisfying - though the Phat Thai and Drunken Noodle were not so 'hot'. The new dishes I ordered and liked very much this round - Soi Thai dried curry minced pork and Stuff Chicken Wing. While it was packed - our dishes were all served straight from the frying pan to the table - hot and fresh. Need I say more? It's a must try for authentic Thai Street food in a busy yet happy environment - no frills but all the thrill from the best and fair-priced eatery. The atmosphere - so true and pleasant, amidst the busy-ness within and queue line outside

Went to Soi Thai at Serangoon twice. 1st time out of curiosity. 2nd time to authenticate their quality. Must say that they are much better than the rave Nahkon Kitchen which had been around much longer but which I find now lacking in the punch which Thai food is supposed to give. Surprisingly, I find the Soi Thai food to be very authentic and delivering the punch I was looking for. Most of the items I tried were good such as the fish cake, chicken wings, Tom yum, basil chicken and green curry. So was the steam tapioca but the red ruby was a disappointment. No chestnut in the rubies but just glue and these turn hard when cold. Overall, I would give them a better rating than Nahkon Kitchen and it is a full house nightly unless one is there early or you will be in a very long queue

We love this place. No frills decor Thai eatery. But the food is authentic Thai cuisine. Highly recommended. The

Ate at this restaurant on our last night in Singapore as staying in the neighbourhood. The food was tasty and inexpensive. We didn't have very much Singapore dollars left and wasn't sure if we would have enough to pay for our food. We asked Patrick to do a quick calculation of two meals and two beers, hey presto we had enough $s and so glad as we both enjoyed it very much. Patrick was great and very patient. Before we left which Round 8:30pm the restaurant was almost full, this is impressive for a Monday night.If you've never been then you must go and you won't be disappointed

Was looking for a neighbourhood Thai restaurant for dinner tonight and stumbled onto Soi Thai Kitchen @Serangoon Garden, though there were some -ve feedback but we decided to go ahead as plan.. The decision was RIGHT. Restaurant was full but they turned around fast and we got our table for 4 in ~20minutes. Ordered 2 drinks + 6 dishes - Tom Yum / Basil Pork / Green Curry / Kang Kong / Pork Cheek / Papaya sales costing S $61/-. Great value for money and most importantly - Good food & service. Will definitely retirn for more and recommend to friends... Kudos to the team...

Went there once with my family and while the food was good, the personnel, starting with the manager, was as rude as it gets, and certainly not representative of Thailand.Went back another time for delivery. Food took more than 45mns despite the restaurant not being busy (turns out half of my order was forgotten at first, so by the time I got the second half, the first one was cold...), the manager was again very rude (at least he gets a thumb up for consistency) and the portions were about half of what it is in any decent Thai restaurant.This place opened less than a year ago and I won't regret them when they fold, which with their attitude they are bound to do sooner than later..

Took a trip down to Serangoon gardens to visit ChompChomp and found out it was closed so we tried the Soi Thai Kitchen and it did not disappoint. I think all hungry pple will like 3 things - quick service, delicious food and affordable.Soi Thai serves up all criterias and will make you want more!

Sunday lunch with a few friends and was glad there was no queue. Order was taken by very friendly staff and food arrived pretty quickly. Papaya salad was delicious. Several other dishes were fine and tasted of Central Thailand flavours without overly sweet. We ordered the fried fish with mango salad as a treat and it did not disappoint. The fish can be fried a little longer but the mango salad was tangy and spicy and yum!!! Cashew nuts were generous. Was surprised only steamed rice was served, no sticky rice

Yes, the customer may not always be right, but being rude about it is another issue altogether.After we were seated, we wanted to order food but we couldn't get the attention of the staff. Understandable, as it was during a busy period. However, when we finally got the attention of a waiter, he came to the table and gave us the "what-do-you-want" expression with a nod of his head. After explaining that we would like to order, he went off to take paper and pen, placed them on the table then left without saying anything.This was not even the end of the bad service. Our friend wrote the wrong order down (as they were all alphabets and numbers), and when a waitress served us coconut juice instead of Thai milk tea, we were confused. So the waitress went back to check the order. She then returned with the menu and the coconut juice, pointed to the menu and the slip of paper and said "You ordered coconut" in a very unfriendly tone, before putting the coconuts down unhappily on our table and walked off. What I didn't like was how she reacted to the situation and treated us as customers. We would gladly take the coconut juice as it was a mistake on our part, but she gave us the "I-told-you-I'm-right" expression and tone and was evidently unhappy that she had to walk back and forth because of that. We initially wanted to ask if we could change to the drinks we actually wanted but decided against it as she didn't seem happy to entertain us at all.The food was not bad, but nothing in particular stood out for me as I could find other places that served the same or even better Thai food, but with better service.I won't be returning to this restaurant until they can prove that they have better service

The restaurant is very plain and nothing fancy. Saw some people wearing just athletic shorts..hmmmm.The food was very traditional Thai and very delicious. Not too expensive and a good deal for the money. I will return when I need to get my Thai urges fulfilled

The food and service staff are good. Friendly and receptive. We would have a great experience dinner dining here, except a pretty rude and poor manners cashier. Realized it's a Sunday evening and the restaurant is quite packed, but this still doesn't give him the excuse of rudeness

This is a new restaurant in Serangoon Garden. So far, my family has patronized this restaurant three times. The food is excellent and the prices are very reasonable. That's why every night the restaurant is full. People certainly know whether to eat good food at reasonable prices. My favourite dishes are olive fried rice, pandan chicken, prawn cakes, basil pork and mango with tapioca. Good service. Be prepared to queue for 15-30 minutes
