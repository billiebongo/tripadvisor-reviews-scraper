The place located in the food court of Suntec City Mall is a poorer and smaller version of the Saravana bhavan.. you dont all the dishes and the dishes are not same tasting as the main place.. the only advantage is that you get some veg food here.

This outlet is not in the Food Republicâ€™s main food court area in suntec. Slightly off from the main dining area, this place is less crowded and chances of getting a seat at peak lunch hour is bright!Service is efficient and the staff are courteous. Despite being a small outlet, it caters a good spread of vegetarian food. Food quality is impeccable and their filter coffee is excellent.If you are in Suntec then it surely worth trying this restaurant for high quality Indian vegetarian food.

This is a chain of Sarvana Bhavan and really lives upto the name, good and cheap south indian food, including north indian food delicacies. Would like to recommend to visit and taste the real food. This is certainly better place than the syed alwi road branc
