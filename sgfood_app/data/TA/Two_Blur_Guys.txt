I had the Foiegrais burger it was perfect two big pieces of foie gras on a very perfect cooked burger with a nice portion of fries
4
I had pulled pork and it was hot and good, but so sloppy to eat. My date ate a burger and it came out medium instead of well done but he ate it anyway and loved it. The potato salad was creamy and fresh.
4
They have good beef burgers, potato wedges, good pulled pork burgers. The burgers come with potato wedges and a small side salad. 4 burgers, 2 beers, 2 sodas came to almost 100SGD. There is inside AC dining and a few tables on the sidewalk.
4
We had our late dinner there, fresh beef pattie, nice bun with it! Small place though but there is some seating outdoor.
3
All mains comes with fried wedges and greens. Love the wedges but the portion could be bigger. As the cooking is open in the restaurant, I do smell when I left.
5
Small place, advise to make reservation. Burgers are really good, with solid beef. Desserts only so-so, but a worthwhile add on
3
The burgers were good. But unfortunately the craft beer from tap that I ordered was lukewarm. Waiter said it’s like that. Can’t change the temperature of the beer.

Two Blur Guys does burgers and does it well. Although it has slightly expanded on its men, burgers are still the main thing. And that's a good thing.I had my usual prime beef and portobello burger and it was juicy and full of flavour. Can't go wrong with this mainstay of their menu. The potato salad was replaced with potato wedges this time. Didn't ask if it was because they changed how they were serving the burger or if they ran out of potato salad. I wanted to try the green chilli pepper popper, which was new on the menu, but they had run out by then.Still, a very satisfying meal. Will be back. Again

Ordered delivery of streaky bacon burger - delivered promptly, with extra truffle & cheesy mayo on the side as requested. I like that you get to choose how rare/well done you want your burger (I ordered med-rare and that's what arrived), and that you get real cheese not some processed piece of plastic. The burger is plain but tasty - beef patty, bacon, cheese, slice of tomato. I only missed a crunch of onion/pickles and the side of wedges could be a bit bigger - thus 4 stars not 5

Owning an upscale Burger place is a benchmark in and of itself. Consistency is the "key" for every dining experience.Having arrived late from Bangkok on "Scoot" air, navigating through the long lines in immigration, and then taking the MRT, and checking in to the hotel all put a damper on trying to grab a bite at Senmi Sushi didn't pan out.So....why not try a burger? This place comes as close to an "In n Out" in taste as any place I have ever tried. On that basis alone, if you like "In n Out", try it. Healthy? Heck no! But at late as it was, on an empty stomach, I had to try it. No regrets. One to 10 for a Burger- how about an 8.5..

Best foie gars burger !!!
Not far from tourists spot marina bay area (2 kms distance) also many restaurants of choice around.
5
Explosive flavours and awesome service. Excellent place to catch up with a group of friends after work.
4
Went there on a Saturday afternoon. Only 2 of us were there, service was prompt. They ran out of foie gras but so we chose another beef burger and one grilled chicken burger. The burgers were flavourful, wet and very tasty.
4
We had the Prime Beef Bacon burger, the Prime Beef Portobello burger, and the Portobello vegetarian burger. The Prime Beef burgers are their speciality and they didn't disappoint!
5
We like it so much that we come here every week or so. The burger patty is juicy and tasty. Try the truffle fries too!
4
we tried the pulled pork & salmon burgers served with salad and potato wedges.. the portion kinda small with thick layers of pork/salmon :) the food overall is pretty simple and not much of uniqueness.. worth a try anyway..
5
Large, fresh, firm beef patty. Upgrade your wedges to truffle fries which were very good. Thick mayo on the side was delicious. Small side greens had a sweet balsamic dressing which cut well through the oily beefNot for a first data nor a place to impress. Ventilation indoors is inadequate and you’ll smell like beef patties and fries for the rest of the date !Value for money ...Tip - by Shake Shack or Fat Burger standards, the beef patty isn’t as tasty so you could consider the Spicy Jalapeño burger .... tell them to hold off on the hot sauce, and then pick excess jalapeños out till it’s just right ....
4
Small cozy place with good burgers. Premium beef and pulled pork/chicken are all very good. Wedges are fantastic! Price is reasonable. Only issue is that it is a little Small, so to enjoy the aircon one would have to endure the smell of the grill on your clothes and hair. Dining outside is possible, but not practical in the afternoons thanks to the Singapore weather
4
love the food especially the prime beef w/ foie gras! always a go-to for burger cravings, love that it's just near our office. a note on service though, as this has been quite consistent through several visits; there are 2 guys manning the kitchen service, and the indian one is always hella rude and unpleasant! like wtf man i'm here to enjoy the food but he always manages to spoil the experience with his general unpleasantness, i swear i would have a better meal if i didn't need to talk to him. the pinoy guy is awesome and friendly all the time though
4
a very unassuming little restaurant that serves good burger. Cheap price are the attractiveness of the restaurant for me. very prompt and polite services. seat outside if you dont mind alfresco as you can get abit of the greasy food smell stuck on you if you sit indoor
5
we happened to pass by and had a few beers and burgers. it was delicious ! absolutely recommended !
they serve different burgers and craft beer.
4
The burger is good and service is prompt. Food is value for money. If visiting in the evening, better to go after 630pm due to the evening sun.
4
Thoroughly enjoyed my Portobello Burger. Highly recommended. Portion was just right and didn't leave me feeling overstuffed. Will visit again when the burger cravings strike
4
Staff was friendly and knowledgeable. Enjoyed the pulled pork - a bit small though and wheat beer was not as chilled as I'd like it to be.
4
We requested for the patties to be of medium doneness and they were were perfect. Burgers were cooked only upon order. It was juicy and tasty, especially the Foie Gras Burger. Service is friendly Would definitely recommend.
4
Generous portions, good quality ingredients and friendly staff. Burger patty is pretty thick and generous. Place ventilation and space a lil cramped.
4
Singlish aside, this was one helluva juicy burger. Taking the waitress' advice, 3 of us got greasy with the classic burger and its wedges and scrap of salad, amd we were all pleased with the choice. And I see some saying 'I quite fancy myself the burger connoisseur' but baby we're INTERNATIONAL and man this was BIG TICKET for Friday night post-work post-drinks. I read some peeps' reviews that claimed the burger was greasy. Ah yeah... BURGER BABY!!! The best paddies are made with the fattiest beef. EAT MORE BURGERS, EAT THEM MEDIUM RARE!!If you want to keep up the facade of a diet, better ask them to hold off on the sauce that it generously lavished on the wedges and the trufle mayo on the main. But if you think that will push you over the edge, well... should have thought about that long ago. Anyway, this ain't somewhere you go for a date. Too saucy. 2nd best burger in Singapore so far: feel bad for the guy who said this was the best burger of his life. Feels bad... man
5
I chance upon this burger place when it first opened, and there was hardly any crowd. These days, I am a frequent at the burger shop - Two Blur Guys, and they are constantly packed with customers. Don't be fooled by the shop name. There is nothing blur about the burgers or the owners. They made one of the best burgers in town. Patties are juicy and well grilled, the sauce is great. What to order and what not?- Order all the prime beef burgers, especially classics like basic prime beef burger, beef burger with bacon, and beef burger with Portobello mushroom. Pulled pork and chicken burger is also a good classic item on their menu. Throw in a truffle fries to complete your meal- Don't order things that shouldn't exist in a burger chain like salmon burgerWhat's new?The joint now works with delivery companies like deliveroo and ubereat, so next time you are hungry just go online to order
5
Came across these guys after craving a burger whilst visiting Singapore and so happy we did. The burger was cooked fresh to your liking and came with melting cheese and truffle mayo. The included wedges smothered with a cheese sauce and the side salad diving. I fancy myself quite the burger connoisseur and this was quite possibly the best one ive ever had!
4
Ordered through Deliveroo and was pleasantly surprised by the portion delivered. Beef was nicely cooked - orderd Beef burger with truffle egg (something along this line) but was kind of disappointed with the truffle egg because I could only taste egg and not truffle.. But truffle fries was good, came with a pack of mayonnaise too. Would definitely order or visit their outlet directly again :
5
A great burger in a very simple place... juicy, delicious meat... great fries... simple but delicious!
4
The prime beef with portobello is very good and value for money. Highly recommended, would go back again
3
A group of eight was there for lunch. Most ordered the new addition - truffle egg burger. There was absolutely no truffle smell. Six (one had pulled pork and one ordered well-done) were all well-done even though we asked for medium. The place was packed and we do not want to return the burgers as it'll be another 20mins wait
3
The burgers we ordered were smoked salmon and pulled pork. The pulled pork tasted a tad too sweet so uwe shared it with the smoked salmon to balance it off. Wedges were part of the set but they arrived lukewarm and a little soft. It tasted like the usual freezer wedges. There was lettuce on the side as well but drizzled with simply vinegrette. On the whole, there is nothing different from other burger joints ,judging from these 2 burgers. However they also serve beef burgers. Shop front situated the page mrt so it is very convenient but poor air circulation and ventilation.
4
I went to Two Blur Guys for lunch with a colleague and I had the Burger with Gruyere Cheese and Bacon and an ice lemon tea for a drink. The burger was very nice and juicy and would definitely recommend. The potato wedges were very nice and the service was as expected with no complaints. The total price for my burger with the drink was 23SGD (USD16.50), which even for Singapore, I consider a little on the high side
4
Came here with a Friend for lunch and ordered their classic Favourite burger. The beef patty is juicy and fresh. I like the fries too. However, the set is too much for lunch. I didn't manage to finish the burger though. Will recommend for those whom like burgers and fries. Seats are limited. Come early for weekday lunch.
4
This is always the place to go when I just simply want a fantastic burger.I tried their new truffle egg burger and it was divine: beef patty was cooked perfectly medium the way I like it, with a nicely seared outside and immensely juicy fatty centre, sandwiched between 2 crispy buttered buns. Multiple yums. The additional truffle egg wasn't too heavily 'truffled', which was wise since the mayo already had truffle flavour, so it didn't overpower the real star of the day - the beef
4
Walking around Chinatown we found this restaurant. Good place for a quick lunch such as a burger and a beer. Burgers are a most especially when generously topped with cheese. Not very fancy but again for a burger place it is very well maintained. Would recommen
4
Found Two Blur guys by chance when wondering in Tanjong Pagar. I had the pulled chicken burger along with a beer and wasn't disappointed. They even have a vegetarian burger which I'm looking forward to trying the next time I'm there. Service was good even though the restaurant quickly became crowded. Reasonably priced beer too.
4
Purportedly one of Singapore's top 12 burgers - easy enough to get onto the list when there aren't that many great burger joints anyway. However, the burgers are cooked to order and preference, and their cheesy prime burger was very generously topped with cheese. I liked that this place is a hole in the wall and it doesn't try to be too gourmet or too hipster
4
Burger taste good even though cooking time was bit long due to 2 crews in a small area. Best recommendation for those who loved eating premium beef burger.
5
I'm a fan burger so i had a quest on the best burgers in singapore! Love their burgers!! Adequate portion to satisfy my cravings plus crispy fries!
5
Nice ambience, amazing and succulent burgers, not to mention beers to seal a great meal. The staff was also immensely friendly!
5
We had a teriyaki burger which was very tasty. The. hubby wanted to go back for another one he loved it so much. Sure we will be there on our next visit.
5
Didnt expect much when i walked in. The place looked like any gourmet burger joints that are sprouting everywhere. It took awhile for them to prepare my order even though i was their 2nd customer. I'm happy i didnt complain as after i took my first bite, i Knew it was worth the wai
4
There is about 10 selections of burger.. I ordered 2 prime beef burger (medium rare) it came with wedges and garden salad.. The beef patty is nice.. especially with the portobello mushroom.. it would be even better if there is more cheese inside the burger.. the ambience is quiet and conducive, small space though.. so maximum 4 person per table.
2
To be honest only came to this restaurant because the lines in the surrounding ones were big. In retrospect i should have waited. Poor service and food. The burger was just way too greasy for my taste. I ordered the Beef and Portobello burger. The chips already had mayo on top and when started eating the burger the truffle mayo was just too much in quantity and flavour, that added fat on the already greasy bottom of the burger (chopped pickles placed with a lot of oil). The beef and the mushroom were good. I don't ask for diet burgers, but i recommend to ease down on the fat
5
How do you improve on a burger consisting of a well-buttered and grilled bun, a perfectly medium-rare beef patty and a juicy grilled portobello mushroom? How do you improve on a burger that spills those sweet delicious meat juices on slicing it?You can't. Maybe by making it cheaper, but that's not an answer. :)This burger completely hits the spot, and has been doing that consistently for the past 2 years since I learnt of this little shop in Tanjong Pagar
4
Went dinner with my colleagues just now after work. We ordered 2 Extreme Cheeseburgers, Pulled Pork Burger and Hawaiian Chicken Burger, Truffle Fries, 2 soft drinks and 2 bottles of Duvel beer which came up to slightly more than S$100. The burgers were good and there was also 1-for-1 promotion for the beer during Happy hour which lasts till 8 pm. Place is a little cramp inside though.
5
The restaurant is small and a bit cramped, however the food is great.I had the Prime Beef with Foie Gras burger, even compared to other burgers I tried in other cities this one stands out among the best.The patty was juicy, the toppings flavorful, and the bun doing its job of holding the good stuff together.The potato wedges were good, and better than the French fries they serve. But I'm not here to rate the entrance to the garden.Worth the price and would come back
4
Grilled chicken pineapple burger was awesome! Potato salad and fries were so-so. Unfortunately the restaurant ventilator was not installed thus had oily smell. Waiter's service was good too.
3
Pretty good quality burgers, nice crispy fries. The restaurant's pretty small and warm, service is average, and you'll come out smelling like you've been in the kitchen for hours. Sit outside!
4
It's a small joint with a cozy ambience. We ordered a smoked salmon burger and one of the beef burgers (sorry can't remember the name).
Food was freshly made and delicious.
4
One of the better places to get a decent burger and not the overpriced crap at mos.
Had prime beef and pulled chicken with fries
They even have deliveroo delivery service 😍
4
I really enjoyed the sumptuous burger and also had a very refreshing beer. The beer could have been served colder though.
4
Well you will never expect such quality for a such small place, theme bughers are so good that they change my way to see the burghers, that burghers are close to poesy, they make you feel like eating salad as they are very light and tasty, i advice you to try theme, once i try i ate for 3 days following but i should stop eating there because of course we are speacking of burghers..
3
The Two Blur Guys was located right near our hotel so it was a handy place for a late evening meal after touring around the city.We ordered two of the marinated pulled pork burgers with Gruyere cheese and honey mustard, which were actually very appetising and very reasonably priced.The meal came accompanied with a small side salad and some fries.However, the bottled craft beers are very expensive here.At almost 14SD, we decided to give this a miss and ordered a couple of latteâ€™s at a much more reasonable price
2
The burger when it finally arrived was decent but nothing too wow, but two of us had finished our burger before our third friend even received hers...and then we were told the fries we ordered wouldn't arrive because they were too busy. Two blur guys... An apt name for a restaurant that seems to make food at the same speed as two vision impaired cooks
2
Not a very satisfying meal . Burger merely mediocre , referring to smoke salmon burger with very miserable tint of avocado salsa for 12.5 . I really don't think this is worth the trip to there . I can simply do this from home and believed will be even better!
3
If you have a craving for a big greasy burger then this place is for you. The place is really small with limited seating so you could be waiting for a while before you get a seat. Fortunately we got a seat inside but noticed that the staff did not clear the table outside so that other patrons could be seated.The burgers are good for a treat but I felt they were a bit too expensiv
5
A small cozy place perfect for families and friends. The beef patties are thick and juicy.
They do not have a huge variety of burgers which is good, as you do not have to crack your head on which to go for.
5
Had the prime beef served medium while gf had the pulled pork. I dig it majorly. Juicy..well seasoned and the dressings were spot on. Wedges enjoyable too. Place needs better ventilation though.
Friendly server made it a great visit.
5
The restaurant may be small but love their service and the food! Whoever loves burgers should try them! No regrets!
5
If you exclude the fancy restaurants, then in my book, this is the best burger place in Singapore. I have tried most of their burgers and my favorite one is the portabella mushroom burger.
4
Great value burgers. Went for the Portobello Burger which came with an excellent thick patty cooked medium and paired very well with the cheese and bun. Definitely better than any burgers you can get from fast food chains.Only downside was the ventilation of the space. I came out smelling from the grill but I guess that's a delicious smell :) Highly suggest you take the seats outside the store
5
This place was crowded during lunch. I was lucky that I was guided to the last table left without waiting.The person who attended was too nice and friendly.The burger came out without taking much time in spite of the number of orders.The burger... The cheese was melting, the patty was juicy that you could see the it was exactly at the right point of cooked. Nothing was too much so I felt I could eat at least another half of that burger (and almost ordered).This place has really nothing to complain that i think I should not recommend because if I do so it will be harder for me to go in. Yes, I don't want to recommend, but if I need to recommend I would like to request please don't go during peak time! And if you go, please allow me to share the table
3
Enjoyed my first time visit here - my bacon burger was nicely done. Portions are alright for the price. There are a limited number of tables so we sat inside. Wrong decision - we came out smelling of the place. I would eat there again, though will be sure to get a table outside instead. Service was pleasant and friendly.
5
Huge serving for a burger. Meat was tender and moist and while the space is a little small, it was comfortable. The service is one of the best that I have experienced from an independent cafÃ© in a long long time. Will definitely return when I have the chanc
3
I made reservations for 8 ppl for 3 days earlier via chop, but I didn't get my table prepared in advance when we arrived. My colleagues have to stand outside and wait for other customers to finish their meal for 10-15mins. Then what is the purpose of the reservation? Although they give us some discount for the total bill and positive attitude, I'm very upset about the service
3
The meat is top quality, the bun is a perfect texture, and the toppings are creative and tasty. Fries, both thick-cut and thin, were well-executed. Service was prompt and friendly. The problem is the size of the burger. The Blur Guys need to learn the trick to avoiding a "meatball" burger - a thumb indent in the center of the uncooked burger. By missing this step, I ended up with a fat, almost ball-shaped burger with gooey toppings on a soft bun - extremely difficult to eat. The burger just kept sliding out the back end of the bun, and when I did manage to trap it on the bun, it was just too high to bite into. Pity, because what I did eat was very good. But with only a fork, and one little napkin, I was ultimately defeated. If you're in the neighborhood and you are craving a burger, you might enjoy The Blur Guys. It's just not somewhere you should make an effort to seek out. Sorry, Blur Guys, you missed the mark
4
The restaurant gets straight to the point. Burgers. There are a few other (delicious) sandwiches on the menu (their pulled pork is great too) but the burgers are always cooked perfectly. I like to come here for take-away comfort food.
5
We stumbled upon this small Bistro one eve when hungry. Never looked back. The greatest burgers, chips, cheese sauce and service. They even gave us a burger on the house when they forgot the cheese on our order! Highly recommended.
4
Was majorly impressed with the burgers here. Cooked whatever way you like them, tender, nice soft bun. I would go back for that jalapeno and chipotle mayonnaise burger without a moments hesitation. Side salad was just a few leaves though, just leave it out if its gonna be like that. Chips were just alright but damn these lads can make a mean burger
5
We came here after searching for a lunch venue during Chinese new year. What a pleasant surprise. The service was excellent and the burgers just as good. The burgers are cooked to your liking and come out just as you've asked for. Also a good selection of sides (truffle fries etc).I would definately recommend this place for a great burger.
4
Was looking around for a burger place and this place was noted on a few websites. Funnily enough this was just about 100 yards from where I was staying.It wasn't too big, but its quite cozy at the same time.Menu was quite simple, Burgers and a few variations to suit all, chicken burger, pulled pork, and a veggie option too.Fries were on the side and was cooked with a hint of truffle oil. I'm not a truffle fan, so it wasn't to my taste.Overall very good value for money for a tasty burger
4
Good burgers and the fries are excellent. Value for money. Service can be a little slow and there isn't much of an ambience (small shop, limited indoor seating , and tables outside next to busy road). So its a great place for a quick bite 
3
I've been here many times for lunch with colleagues and always thought the burgers were okay. Not sure about the chopped pickle added to it and have more than one occasion felt that they don't understand the word "medium". It comes far too raw almost.It's a small cosy place and too small for 3 Europeans to sit comfortably inside.Staff are friendly though but always rushed off their feet
5
We had the prime beef burger and it was cooked to perfection! We also had the smoked salmon salad which had the most salmon ever that i had on a salad. The portions were just nice for 1 and so yummy! Top-up for the meal and enjoy their apple crumble pie and ice lemon tea which was just as good
5
One nighy, undecided on what to have for dinner, we walked around to find somewhere to eat close to the Orchid Hotel. My bf totally missed the burger joint but I managed to point it out and ask if he was keen...knowing that he was craving western food. We had excellent service, the burgers are huge and the wedges are the best. Its a very small place but its so special. Delicious food, great service and an epic lil gem to find in Singapore.The only downside was the salad. Only lettuce and tomato. Just a heads up..but overall...this place is fantastic! Free wifi and air con available
4
I had the beef burger with bacon and cheese. It was nicely cooked and went down well with one of their own wheat beers. They also have a Pilsner. The wedges weren't great though. I've had much better burgers in the gourmet burger places in Kuala Lumpur so don't agree with the comments saying best burger in Asia but still pretty good. Burger was $18 and beer was $9. 3/5 for food but good beer gives it 4/5 overall
3
I ordered their pulled pork burger and it was nice! I'm not a burger person but this is quite special to me.
Service is ok. Staff very friendly.
However, the portion is too small for that price. Also, they have limited seats in the shop.
4
I had a prime beef with bacon and gruyere cheese. Really probably the best casual burget place in Singapore.
3
Burger are nice and juicy but I would prefer a wider selection and french fries or other side dishes. Staff is nice but they seem shorthanded. I would return for more!
5
Always love having a burger here :) the pull pork is my favourite! Comes with wedges or you can ask to change for the delicious potato salad. Good for lunch or an evening meal with friends. Oh and the iced lemon tea is incredible value and yummy
4
Ordered a Portabello & beef burger and it came out in a tiny tiny bun. The meal was lovely but for the price was surprised how small the burger was.Would eat here again but would not be surprised again by the size of the meal
4
We went to place around 5 p.m. on Saturday 11. Prime beef with streaky bacon was full of flavor and juicy. Pull pork was also nice with slide GruyÃ¨re Cheese was quite good. Wages and a few leaf was just good. We will return for sure.
4
I have been to their place multiple times and tried a variety of their burgers but the Pulled Chicken burger is the best! It beats all other options they have! It might not be as big as the burgers are Fat Boys but trust me they are jucy and equally delicious! A must try if you are a fan of burgers
4
They don't serve the biggest burger in town, neither is it the cheapest, but they did get the mix right: juicy patty, soft bun, chopped relish (not sliced, appreciated), tasty potato salad as well as lettuce with a sweet balsamic. I've had better burgers elsewhere, but I've also had worse. Simple menu and set-up. Place to go to for a decent burger with no crowd
5
Been in Singapore for about 3 months and had to have a burger. Best advice I got (in terms of burgers) was try Two Blur Guys. One fantastic burger. Cooked just the way I like, bun grilled (and still warm) when served, big burger, gruyere cheese (and includes potato salad / greens). No fries, but don't let it hold you back
5
- This is the only place (that I have known of) that serves Samuel Adams (Boston beer)! I couldn't find it anywhere else in South East Asia- Perfect portion size- Recommended the pulled-pork burger (marinated pork, gruyere cheese, and honey mustard) and the prime beef burger (it comes with Gruyere cheese and truffle mayonnaise
