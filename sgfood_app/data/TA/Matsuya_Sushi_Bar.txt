This place is next to Naumi hotel where I stayed. I choose the 8 course Omakase and it's very nice. The sushi here also remarkable. The chef is not Japanese but Singapore Chinese but the taste of the foods were awesome.

It has moved to other new location along the Seah street but the restaurant has bigger space and has kitchen to prepare more variety of cooked food. Always provide attentive services with lots of sake and whiskey choices to chose from. Oyster, sashimi, grilled hamachi cheek, sushi and soup. Ask Ben to prepare for you his Omakase and you just tell him what you don't want to eat . Affordable price in singapore as compare to many other restaurant.

Very good sashimi, sushi and maki rolls. Try the Special Maki which is aburi salmon with a dash of mayo, delicious. The bento sets are good value for money too. Small restaurant with fewer than 20 seats so it’s advisable to make advance reservation.

We decided to take a punt on this place. We were the only ones in the restaurant and felt a tad nervous. But it was the best sushi I have ever had outside of Japan. The chef and staff were so great and the food was simply delicious. Can’t recommend it enough!!

First let me say, I love sushi, and I eat it at least twice a week. We stumbled into Matsuya Sushi just looking for a snack and had a few pieces of nigiri. I took one bite of the salmon and vowed to come back. At lunch the next day, we did the 7 course omakase menu. Every bite was extraordinary. The fish was fresh and sweet and tender like I have never had. The variety and craftsmanship of the dishes were spectacular. This will be my benchmark to which I compare all sushi

What a treat! Next door to the Naumi hotel. Generously proportioned lunch special, and AMAZING sushi. Bluefin tuna straight out of a freshly delivered box; superb. Chef Benson Teo convinced me to taste sea urchin for the first time in my life, and I loved it. Beef dish served to the people sitting next to use also looked delicious

Those who have been to Japan will agree that friendly owner and chef Benson Teo makes this unique restaurant stand in the same level as the top omakase places across the country. What makes Matsuya the best Japanese place in Singapore is its unique combination of a highly skilled executive chef, the adoption of only premium ingredients and fair prices. Like a rare Japanese pearl, it is a small and very precious place right in the middle of many restaurants and hotels. Its convenient location right next to the Raffles hotel and at walking from City Hall, Bugis and Esplanade stations make it an even easier choice. Do not miss the chance of trying some of the best sushis you will ever have!

Chef and owner Benson Teo is a magician in preparing the most delicious sushi in Singapore. I stumbled upon this simple looking sushi bar not expecting that my tastebuds would be seriously pampered. The master chef let me try various dishes and explained them. Each dish was prepared in a simple way but with great attention to detail. The sushi was served one at a time with wasabi and soy already added for succulent flavour. Service is friendly and impeccable. This must be the best secret in town. Not to be missed - seriously

A few steps away from the Raffles, this simple looking restaurant offers delicious sushi. Very fresh, classic sushi, at local prices, ie not really cheap.There were few patrons when we went (a bit late maybe, after 9pm) so the atmosphere was quiet.Staff is extremely nice
