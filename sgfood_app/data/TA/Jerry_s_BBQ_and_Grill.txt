I was there in the afternoon for lunch and it's a nice cosy place where I sat the glass window. Food portion is big enough for a hearty meal. Delicious pulled pork burger paired with potato salad.
4
Nice Ribs and Beers. and wide menu selection very nice lasgane and deep fried mushroom and wings. i would come back after again, my first visit was in early year 2000
4
They advertised their ribs as their Star but honestly, their battered mushrooms was the star. They tasted excellent. Not saying that the ribs were bad but i’ve Had better. Try the mushrooms, u won’t be disappointed.
4
Not the first time here but its still the same after all these years. Good service with the familiar taste.
5
Food was good. It may be a little pricy.. Location was fine too.. Buffalo wings is a must to try.. staff service can be better..
4
Surprise that there is a basement here... Nice venue for gathering, drinks and dinner with friends... pork ribs & buffalo wings - recommended
4
Pork Knuckle was too dry.
Will go back just for ribs, wings and sticky date cake.
Spent about $140 for 4 pax; without drinks.
4
Wings zing shiook, ribs so tender ! Lamb chops delicious with mash potatoes yummy.
We enjoyed the nicely prepared

Out of curiosity in sengkang area where the best prata was built. I and my friend was so curious to try the american restaurant named Jerrys bbq and grill, and what we found is, this restaurant was so famous in buffalo wings where they are offering differnt level of spiciness ( it depends how you can take it). We just ordered level one as majority of us never take spiciness. The buffalo wings was so nice and very flavorfull plus the blue cheese was so so. It was nice not a typical american buffalo wings. We also tried their succulent pork bbq ribs and it really melt in your mouth and you will crave it for more. We also ordered pork knuckle as their promotion . The pork knuckle was very nice i like the way it cooked crispy out side very tender inside that totally seperate the bone to the meat. Definitely will go back again. Plus their superb service and very nice erdinger beer
5
Last friday night! We tried the famous Pork Knuckle promo on this Resto. The 'Pork Knuckle' as it's simply the best. This knuckle spoil your tounge so well and the side dishes(saurekrate & loaded mashed potatoes) was perfect. We had a great dining experience. I'll try it again soon. Must try folks.
5
Made reservations prior. Menu was simple and good variety. Ordered Trio combo with beef brisket, pork ribs and chicken. Excellent, excellent!! A must visit. Aviation themed artwork and a proudly posted American flag!
4
Really good ribs, decent food. Ambience is average and food is a tad pricey but at least the quality isn't bad. Worth a visit.
4
Stopped for drinks because we needed a morale boost. Gin-n-tonics, both plain and "fancy" (raspberry), definitely did the trick. Service was prompt and delightful.
4
Place had a retro feel. Mixed feelings on this. Guess done will like, some may not. Aircon wasnt strong so place was a bit warm for us. Otherwise, friendly staff, food was not too bad.
4
The buffalo wings (Level 2 spiciness) are a must try. The clam chowder is good too, served in a crispy bread bowl. The bbq pork ribs is cooked meat falling off, great!
4
The ribs is relatively okay and nice. The service waiter are attentive however the food there are nothing to shout about.
3
The food waa of decent quality. However the service was poor. Our appetisers came after our mains. When we asked multiple times how long more would it take, the waiter never replied us. Like stated earlier. The appetosers took far longer than necessary. The nachos came after the lamb chop and chicken and ribs platter
3
As I have mentioned, we will be back to challenge ourselves with Jerry's Buffalo Wings at level 5 (Jerry's Insanity) and we did. It was so spicy that even my mighty chilli padi mummy announced that she daren't challenge to the last level! All agreed the Clam Chowder Soup served in sour dough bread cup was heavenly and we could even just come back for the soup alone. Their Memphis Style Hickory Smoked BBQ Pork Ribs & Smoked-Roasted Chicken with BBQ sauce did not disappoint. It came with steamed vegetables and a choice of fries, BBQ baked beans or potato salad. We had fries which were mediocre but the potato salad was great. As it was dinner time, it was more crowded than when we visited at lunch time. Service is still passable. The ambience at night is cosier and even outdoor seating is quite romantic. As usual, the aircon interior is wheelchair inaccessible and with a more careful look, the gravel footpath leading to the restaurant is indeed too difficult or impossible for wheelchair users to manoeuvre without spoiling the tyres
2
Went on a Sunday with chope promo n only discovered there were 2 chope promo ongoing for me.upon reaching,verify e chope promo with service staff which staff mentioned he will advice which promo can I get when ordering which he did not do so. I change my seating capacity before arriving n service staff were not aware which resulted another unhappy customers making a fuss in front of me while the service staff push the blame to us
3
Six of us arrived at 6.30. Plenty of room. Wine list ok but not exhaustive by the glass. Beer prices ok.Food.Mmmm. Might be stuck in the 80's. Now I realise pulled pork isn't supposed to be piping hot, but French fries are. Ours weren't. Pork dry. Steamed veggies were ok but consisted of a few cauliflower pieces and two carrot batons.At least the meal prices were very reasonable
3
Place was easy to find. Decorated with Pilot and Flying collectibles. Large American portions. Rocket salad was not worth it. Ribs were soft and good.
5
The food and drinks came really fast!... we had a fantastic time at Jerrys. Going back soon!
My family's first visit to Jerrys!... they found the service efficient and the food fantastic!...
5
First visit back to Jerry's in 3 years, and the food and atmosphere remains great. Used to be my Pak for dinner place, now it's one of my favourite family dinner place!
4
Had a business lunch here. Small dining area, so reservations are good with any groups. Airplane theme inside. Had a pulled pork sandwich with cold slaw and potato salad. The set lunch included soup (mushroom) and coffee afterwards. All the food was delicious.
4
A nice place to hang out with a fairly large portion of food. Their service can be improve as it's quite hard to get their service crew attention maybe due to the fact that we went down on Valentine's day.
5
Simply love the food! !! The buffalo wings gotta be my favorite, and a few other dishes such as ribs, clam chowder, ascagots and ox tail soup are all so very wonderful.
3
Having lived in Jalan Kayu for some big parts of my life and having known Jerry's existed for quite some time in this area, I thought it will bring nostalgic feelings for my old parents to return to this restaurant after vacating Jalan Kayu for quite a while. We wanted to challenge ourselves and ordered the Buffalo Wings at level 4 (Chef's Challenge). To us, the wings were yummy but still not spicy enough. We will be back for level 5 (Jerry's Insanity). The cod fish & chips were tasty as well as the oxtail stew but I can't find the big chunks of potato & carrots in the stew as stated in the menu. They could be more generous with these vegetables & the very small slice of bread served with the stew. Better still, this stew could be served in a bread bowl. The greatest disappointment was the Kurobuta Pork Chop that my dad ordered. At $29.95, it can't even be compared to the Coffeeshop pork chop that costs about $7.50as it was so very very tough. I will be back to taste test their Memphis Style Hickory Smoked BBQ Pork Ribs & Caesar's Salad which used to be good but no more Kurobuta Pork Chop for me!! Service here is not bad. The aircon interior is wheelchair inaccessible as there is an entrance kerb to conquer but if you don't mind the heat outside, they do have some tables outside. But again the gravel footpath leading to the restaurant is rather challenging for wheelchair users to manoeuvre
5
The ribs were good to eat. They are tasty, melt in my mouth, and are unlike any ribs I've had before. My buddy and I had a heated debate on whether or not those ribs came from human origins. I've watched enough episodes of 'Dexter' to recognise a human rib when I see it. The staff assured us that it came from a pig, but at that point I just wanted more ribs.Pig or not, this place has become my go-to place for delicious ribs.10/10 will explore my cannibalistic inklings agai
3
Portioning of the food was great.my buddy had a seafood aglio olio and to our surprise they serve fresh prawns + fresh scallops with some fish with it. their version of aglio olio is unique and very filling!I had the pacific grilled dory served with mash potato and steam vegetables. i gave it a 8/10.Buffalo wings, we wanted to enjoy it and not drink water nonstop. therefore we ordered the level 1 which is tasty to our liking!Price wise alittle too pricey. Total we paid 69$ as our main course comes with e set (soup + main + dessert)The dessert tiramisu was good, just abit too much cream
3
Have not been here for some time, had good memories and experience before. The food quality was only ok, but the service needs to be improved. The kitchen forgot about one of orders and we had to wait for our friend when all of us had finished. The wait staff did apologise for the delay.
5
We stopped to quench the thirst whilst waiting for a friend service was good and the beer was nice and cold what more could you ask for?
4
Had the beef brisket burger, a side of potato salad and coleslaw and bottle of beer for an afternoon snack. Portions were quite hefty, and the service was good. The crew was also very accommodating.
5
We have been here many times and have enjoyed the good dishes always. The quality of the food was outstanding. Did not have anything we did not like here.
Great place. Thank you.
3
We went to Jalan Kayu for dinner and gave this place a try. We ordered the Buffalo Wings and their signature BBQ Pork Ribs (1/2 slab). The taste was average and the service was also average. Probably not coming back for another visit.
3
Ordered the pork ribs. But didnt felt anything special to it. It was more of an average dish. Rather decent compared to the food in the northeast area. Based on the price of it vs the dish, it was a bit on a high side. Either they should improve the dish or decrease the price
5
" i used to be a regular customers at jerry's bbq and grill because this place has a peaceful atmosphere and has a delightful food and service. I used to order beers with the accompaniment of delicious PORK RIBS and most talk about buffalo WINGS . I just only ordered level 2 buffalo wings for almost every week i been here and a regular customers for along time i may said that this restaurant preserved what food and what authenticity it has. I cannot find other restaurant like this. The food and the service is really delightful and delicious

Whenever we do have a family vacation we always think and look a place that we can enjoy, and food that suits to our tastebuds. Since i always travelled and been working in singapore for the last 3 years and tried different food at different restaurant. I recommend to my family the favorite restaurant i always visited that really give me so much pleasure and burf☕ . Jerry' s bbq and grill! Located at 277 jalan kayu which theme is mostly airplaine and helicopter toys (its quite old but really relaxing). When we approached the restautant the service man (maybe the manager) approached us with a smile asking us if we want to sit outside or inside (since the weather is good we sat at the al fresco side of the restaurant) he immediately gave us the menu( since i know the place i volunteer to order and give a try the jerrys most talk about buffalo wings, the chicken quesadilla and deep fried mushroom for our starter and full slab pork ribs, beef fajita, beef brisket platter ,cajun pasta and seafood alo alo for our main course. The food was so great that really jive to the tastebuds of my family, in short they really enjoy it ,specially the fried mushroom, the wings and full slab that totally fall out to the bones plus the bbq sauce that is so love love.... from the first time i tasted their food until now is so consistent and delicious.The service is so attentive and accomodating. They are really niceAll in all it was a delightful experience and will definitely visit again. Kudos to the team jerrys
5
We've been visited here whenever we do have a family gathering and from time to time jerry's give us a consistent and.satisfying food ( the wings is so so love.love the spiciness of it is nice.to what.we are.looking.for), the deep fried mushroom is something that you can't forget the taste, the freshness of it and the tartar.sauce. And wait, the pork Ribs is so so so delicious.(it is fall of to the bones) and that really nice in the bbq sauce. We also tried the beef fajita and it was superb the meat is soft and the taste is so yummy . The service is so accommodating and attentive they give us a treatment that very well. It was a delightful and always unforgettable dinning experience. Really worth the visit. Will definitely recommend to my friends. Kudos

I remember back when my family would frequent this quaint Aussie flight themed restaurant every weekend for dinner back in 2012.The hot wings were great. The fried mushrooms were great. The baby back ribs were great. Hell even the service was great. But alas change happened and now its just an average joint for the average joe.I miss the good old days eating at Jerrys. :
4
We love very spicy wings and have tried at many places. 2 weeks back we decided to try Jerry's. Ordered Level 4 and 5 but were disappointed as there's no tinge of spiciness. More like tomato kind of taste. 2 days back, we decided to give it another go and ordered Level 6 but to make it even spicier. It worked our tongues and lips this time! We are happy people at the end of that day.
5
The pork ribs was very peculiar in a sense that your taste buds will surely burst into a heavenly sensation and will surely visit again..
4
I really enjoy going to this place, it might not be the best all around barbecue but it really fills my wing craving. So big and delicious.
4
the ambience is good. food is good with a reasonable pricing too! serving is big perfectly good for sharing
4
Hubby ordered the half rack of ribs and half cooked chicken, whilst I ordered pulled pork with potato salad. The service was ok and the food was good - hubby was particularly impressed with the ribs! Would definitely visit again.
5
Visited Jerry’s BBQ and Grill at Club Street during our vacay last May. Oh! Wide choice on menu to suit all tastes. Had a best seller deep fried mushroom as our starter, pork ribs that tollay fall out to the bones, Ribeye steak in garlic butter (very tender meat) " it was superb. I think that the prices are quite reasonable for the quality of the dish. We honestly enjoy the foods. For our next vacation we will definitely be going back to try the other things on the menu. I highly recommend it for an informal dinner out. The ambiance of the restaurant is laid-back. All in all the visit makes up for a pleasant and greatly satisfying experienced. Keep it u
4
Thumbs up for the wings.Meaty and juicy,not quite like any other vinegar-based Buffalo wings which you might be expecting.Steaks were deliciously tender,200grams and menu priced at $28.95,not cheap.But again the waitress pointed out these were USDA,Angus Grade.Overall good experience and we will be back
4
Invited a few friends to the place. Half way through our meal, I chanced upon the last review, was concerned and asked the waitress about it. She fiercely defended the restaurant. She said the street itself was to blame for the pest because the street's garbage and waste from all its bars and eateries was badly managed. She assured us the hygiene of this place is their top priority always.We were happy with what we had. The place was not new, but it was well kept.Do keep up the good work

Went out drinking in Singapore's bar street whilst on vacation. Got to that time of night where the munchies struck and being a BBQ fan wandered into Jerry's. Ordered some drinks and my wife went to the restroom. On her return she told me the restrooms were squalid and I stated Don't worry we are not staying. She asked why and I pointed out the 2lb RAT that wandered out from the direction of the kitchen sat on his hind legs and proceeded to groom its self. We left immediately only to be pursued up the street by the waitress demanding we pay for the food we had ordered and drinks we hadn't touched .We told her exactly where to go and went back to our hotel at Sentosa. If you have eaten here recently I would go for a health check 
1
Food was the worst ever! And expensive! Low quality pasta and mediocre cooking. Giant bbq prawns are not fresh and should be called large prawns at best. Ordered the striploin steak and it was served charred on the hot plate! How to eat? The French fries was black and burnt on one side. Oh, and forget about the dessert. The ice cream uncle sell better ones. Will never even think of coming again!!
5
Waiters are polite, soups taste nice, ribs is tender and full of bbq flavor. Chicken is the better food especially its thigh and drumstick. Well cooked. Overall great food difficult to find in suburban areas. Problem is tiramisu is sold out before i can rub my tummy.Worth another visit
5
The food was amazing and lots of variety ..even for non Filipinos.. for sure there is something for everyone.

Since a child I've visited this outlet of Jerry's BBQ & Grill. The truly do still have the best buffalo wings. Always crispy with a lovely sauce, I've tried level 3 and 4 and as someone who loves indonesian sambals level 4 is to me is 'spicy' and still very delicious without being too hot. Other dishes I've tried were their deep fried appetizer platter. The cheese sticks and jalepeno poppers were great but the fried pickles aren't more for someone with the taste buds for pickles. I also have had their seafood chowder soup which was really nice but lacked that deep seafood flavor and tasted more like a cream of seafood than a chowder. Loved the bread bowl though and we ate most of it!Their BBQ ribs are totally worth trying although pricey, the meat truly is tender, fall apart and tasty although the seasoning doesn't go all the way through. Their beef brisket sandwich despite having a lovely smoky flavor was very dry and the slices of meat too thick which made it though and difficult to eat. The beef was a big let down and also wasn't affordable so don't bother with that item!If you are in the area or plan to come to Jalan Kayu, do stop by Jerry's and share their delicious wings with a friend or two

Short version: Great food, friendly staff, surprisingly large menu, very high quality raw materials.Verbose version: I am not a big fan of the Club Street Scene (too old, perhaps?) but I live next door (Telok Ayer) and have walked the street and tasted their offerings a few times. Three years ago, when I moved here, Telok Ayer / Amoy Street was nothing like it is today with a restaurant or bar in every building. In fact, finding a place to eat on a Sunday was next to impossible. This is the reason I first happened upon Jerry's. It was one of a handful restaurants open on a Sunday between South Bridge Road and Shenton Way.As mentioned in the short version, it has a great selection of typical US foods: Steaks, barbecue everything, and a nice selection of sides and snacks. Also, food quality is excellent - how do they do it? This place must have a history. Factually I only know that it was opened in 2003 and that the American Ambassador was in attendance. Whenever I have my Sunday dinner here there is always at least one party of Americans that seems to have had a good time ... since lunch. A good sign, I would think.I would say this place is pretty authentic if you are looking for a typical US menu. And "yea", the food is really good
4
Great restaurant both in the Jalan Kayu and Club street areas. If anything they give you too much food. We ordered starters, deep fried mushrooms and chicken wings and along the mains there was too much food. One of our friends in the group is a chicken wing expert and he said they were great and pretty hot. In fact he was sweating with the #5 wings which were the 2nd hottest.They excel in their barbecue. We had the barbecued pork chops and the pulled pork. They have an interesting side for the main, it was fried dill pickles. Different and interesting.The price was quite reasonable
5
Nice BBQ Pork Ribs and buffalo wings. Portions are big and price is reasonable. Services was attentive and fast. We didn't have a reservation but a table was late by more than half hour and they gave us that table. Portions were big, at least for the pork ribs. The wings were tasty with a nice cheese based sauce. Worth coming back again to try their other dishes.At least the waitress was very honest when I asked her which was the better option, most will tell you they are all good and it doesn't help when you need to choose one and she was right
1
Used to be a regular of the Jalan Kayu restaurant,my last visit being 4-5 years ago.Went there during lunch with 2 friends late August.... This place does not live up to its name and past glory. One of the worst service ever seen in Singapore (one of the two waiter was simply impolite, unprofessional and non interested by his job), tables are barely cleaned after service and food can be rated as barely average.In my view a place to forget. Old Jerry is definitely gone and there are much better BBQ places around.My and my friends will never set foot in this place agai
4
Had a hankering for BBQ & variety of beers so our Singapore friends brought us to Jerry's. It turned out to be a lovely night. They have a huge menu ranging from salad to sandwiches to pasta to of course BBQ meats.We had their fried mushroom & jalapeÃ±o poppers for starters. The mushroom was super moist inside with a crunchy exterior. One of the best I've had. The poppers were just okay. Next up was the buffalo wings in 2 levels (regular & spicy) & a full slab of ribs. The wings were drenched in the yummy sauce. Crispy exterior while still juicy & moist inside. Decent size as well. The wings itself was worth the visit. The ribs was huge. Lovely BBQ sauce & the meat was falling off the bone. They have a lovely selection of beers to boot. We tried at least 4 of them. They also have cocktails, juices & soda so something for everyone.Will definitely return some time to try out their other dishes. The beef brisket is rather tempting. Drools

Located along Jalan Kayu, a road that is more famous for roti prata, this little restaurant/bar is a refreshing change. The cosy-looking indoor air-conditioned section had 4 to 5 small tables, while the air- or fan-cooled outdoor sections had plenty more tables for those who desire an al fresco dining experience. Good selection of beers but had to skip that as I was the designated driver for the night.We chose to forego the main dishes and just share a number of appetisers instead. The deep fried mushrooms came recommended and while a simple dish, was quite tasty. I thought the steamed mussels in wine would come out looking like traditional Belgian mussel et frites but was really more of a slightly spicy soup. But the most fun was trying the spicy Buffalo wings. They come in 5 levels of heat and we chose the fourth level (Chef's Challenge). Ok, it was spicy but not so ridiculously hot as to give one temporary loss of senses. Not too bad overall, will probably be back with a bigger appetite
4
Im a huge fan of buffalo wings and i have tried almost all the popular joints that offer buffalo wings and the clear winner is Jerry's! They offer 5 level of spiciness and level 3 is the maximum I've tried. The wings are deep fried, coated generously with smoked bbq sauce, killer hot sauce and cayenne pepper powder. The wings are served with celery and carrot sticks as a quick relief for your burning tongue and mayo dip. Wings were hot and fresh and the sides and drinks are reasonably priced. They have an extensive drinks selection too. The service was prompt but the main dining are looks lil outdated with aviation posters and gadgets decorating the walls everywhere. There is a cellar dinning room and outdoor seats to serve customers on busy days. Give it a try if you're a huge fan of spicy buffalo wings.
4
I recently visitied their Club Street location with our family for lunch. The staff was friendly & service was efficient. The food was good. The pulled pork, tri-tip & pork ribs were all flavorful and appropriately tender. The wings were the standout and I truly appreciated the selections of spice level to meet personal preference needs.Note: They also have an upstairs section which is cooler if you are not a fan of warmer temps
4
Original!!!!! Everyting i ordered was good. Level 2 buffalo wings was just right for me not too spicy, crispy chicken wings, the seafood spaghetti ALO ALO, baked potato skin. Nice relaxed atmosphere.
4
Simple and small restaurant located along Ann Siang hill area.. Nice ambiance, kinda of old school.. Food is great.. not expensive though...
5
Jerry's in Jalan Kayu has a reasonably extensive menu of grilled and barbecued dishes. Being semi - vegetarian we had the fish and the salmon and both were excellent ( to us westerners having gravy on the potato when we were eating fish was different but did not detract at all).A great little on the street setting kept comfortably cool by the fans enables you to enjoy watching the activity of this different part of Singapore. There is inside dining for those who must have aircon
3
We chose Jerry's after some recommendations but it certainly fell below our expectations. Decoration is tired and needs major refresh. Old fashioned menu with quite tempting descriptions but the food under delivers. Potato boats were reheated and dry, the famous ribs were just drowned in incredible amounts of a not very good sauce that just hid the quality and flavour of the meat. The pork dish was ok but sad looking. This might have been a great place years ago but standards must have relaxed too much.Service was excellent, thoug
4
A fare warning to all. Their level 5 wings are the hottest I've ever had and I've had a lot. Great taste which is unusual when you get them so hot. Great atmosphere, nice people, and a great taste of home when your away. I hope to go back soon
4
The bottom line is that in the US this would not rate as a BBQ restaurant but in Singapore it is tops. They have no idea how to BBQ in Singapore so a trip to Jerry's is about as good as it gets. The BBQ ribs were tasty and sauce was tangy/sweet. Cole slaw is always a disappointment in Singapore although it really doesn't make any sense because cabbage and dressings are plentiful...perhaps the locals just don't like to eat it. The slaw at Jerry's is good but servings are way too small. Jalay Kayu roadway makes this a pretty unappealing location but the new bypass should improve the atmosphere considerably once it is completed. All in all... for BBQ in Singapore..give it a try. I rated it low on atmosphere simply because it sits just a couple feed from a road loaded with heavy construction trucks, buses and cars. I mean- the trucks are literally 20-30 feet from your table..
4
Been here for months and have found this place, read some of the other reviews........not sure what their looking for, but inpp a city where It's easy to spend a small fortune on "rubbish" then this is a little bit different, great food, fantastic service, airy space and al fresco. Lamb chops and pulled pork did it for us. Not to mention the best fried mushroms my wife has evet tasted, I don't do sweets, again the Pecan pie was a winner, a cold Merlot. Game over ball burst. Jerry's is a great place to spend a couple of hours and relatively little cash........
3
I took a colleague to Jerry's last week during her visit from the US, the food was good enough, we certainly enjoyed it, however, the steaks were average. We had some excellent level 3 hot wings to start with, I would go for level 4 next time, but, I like hot wings!I wouldn't necessarily recommend it as the first place to go, the price was ok, the food was ok and the location is fine. Nothing too special I'm afraid
3
I've been to Jerry's a few times now, and their food is consistent. There is a lot of meat, and large portion sizes, so if you're really hungry then this could well be the spot for you. I've had their pulled pork twice now and it is pretty good although a little dry. They do have pitchers/jugs of beer on the go as well, so it's a great place for a catch up and feast. It's not particularly magical inside, a little run down even, but if you go there, you go there for a big feast rather than it being a place to be seen. If you're missing hearty American food then I would recommend here, although the corn is over-cooked, don't be holding out for some crunchy corn, it's not going to happen. It's also on Club Street so there are plenty of places for after dinner drinks
2
If you call a pulled pork sandwich "Memphis Style" it must be topped with slaw and there is no way to call it that without it. Having lived in Memphis I can assure you that is the definition. Service good but the BBQ was mediocre at best. Had they not advertised as Memphis BBQ my expectations would have been lower and the score would be higher
5
This is as close as you can get to authentic Buffalo wings in Singapore. Decent atmosphere, too.....has small town restaurant/bar feel. Management is quite friendly, as well.
Choice of indoor and covered outdoor seating.
3
Although it's not so cheap here but the food here are not bad. Love the deep fried mushroom and buffalo wings. Not bad place to chat and chill with friends.
4
Jerry’s has great ribs. Here's my favorite order: Half-slab pork ribs, fries, cole slaw, finished off with pecan pie a la mode and a cup of coffee. Life doesn’t get any better than that.
Service is extraordinarly good, gracious.
4
Cosy casual dining. Nice buffalo wings and best California health salad. Staff non intrusive and price ok!
5
Authentic American dine from Memphis...really tasty on its Grills, then the menu is wide from its appetizer to desserts.

Authentic American Dine from Memphis... Really tasty on its grills!

Food was so-so

Whenever I passed by this place at night, there is always lots of people sitting outside enjoying their alfresco dining. We always wanted to try this outlet but had no chance to try it. Therefore we finally decided to try and on Sunday afternoon, My husband brought me and my mum(not many restaurant can satisfy her taste bud) to try this restaurant. We went to Jalan Kayu branch, when we stepped into the restaurant, there was only two tables full, and we were so happy to choose a place near to the air con on this hot afternoon. The feeling was good once you entered the restaurant. Service assistants were courteous. This is our first time to this restaurant and they were patient enough to explain to us those things on the menu that we did not understand. The ambience in the restaurant is good, although it is quite old, it makes you feel like going back again and again. The red checkers table cloth make you feel like you are in an American old town restuarant. Food wise, heard that their buffalo wings are nice, so we ordered 6 pieces of wings, and you can choose the spicy level from 1 to 5. We dare not choose too spicy and had chosen the medium level. There are restaurants claiming that their buffalo wings are authentic, I did not know what is the authentic taste of buffalo wings but after trying the wings at Jerry's, I just like it!!! To be frank, I don't care what is the actual taste of buffalo wings, I just like the taste of this!!! My hubby had ordered the Pork ribs and my mum ordered fish and chips. I had ordered seafood platter, taste not bad but the deep fried dishes are quite dry, but not oily. It was nice with a glass of Erdinger beer!!!In all, our dining experience at this restaurant was good, price is reasonable, food portion is big, and we will definitely go back again to try other dishes!!

Went to the Club Street restaurant some days ago and had the Ribs & Chicken duo to share and the deep fried mushrooms for starters. I'm not an expert on Memphis style ribs so can only comment on what I've had here. The ribs were very tender and fell of the bone easily but I felt the huge amount of sauce slapped on top overpowered the meat and took away most of the "meaty" flavours. The chicken was ok/bit dry but again the sauce killed it. I'm more a fan of the pre-marinated ribs with a tasty dry-rub applied to it...no extra sauce needed. $33++ for 1/2 a slab of ribs and 1/2 a chicken is slightly on the high side as it is one of the cheapest cuts of pork.The service was excellent though. Not intrusive and consistently good timing from the waiter/owner. Also decent prices for the drinks, especially compared to the rest of Club Street.Overall an ok experience although I won't be hurrying back for the famous ribs. Including two drinks each it cost us $105

We were pretty hungry by then so we settled at this restaurant to eat cause we were looking for halal and there ain't much.It was late at night like around 9pm. It was Halloween night so maybe the shops closed in early or something. So when we sat outside the restaurant, we enquired the staff to get us a seat inside cause it was warm outside. So he said politely to us to wait and eventually there was a seat:)The food was not bad, typical western food with steak or fish and chips. I liek the whip potato though. And my friend ordered an ice-cream which she could not finish. The serving size was ok. Just us girls small size tummy. Overall, it isn't that bad cause we don't have anywhere else to dine-in but if tehre are other restaurants and not so expensive I think this isn't the choice. depend

Went there 3years ago....food was average and rather expensive for a simple establishment.Decided to give it another try this month Nov 2008 after reading some reviews.To our disappointment, we should have gone elsewhere for our dinner gathering.1) Service was rather poor. In fact, there was hardly any servie. We had to refill our drinks by ourselves. This is despite the fact that the restuarant was only 30% filled.2)Very warm place despite the aircons and fan.3)Food was average. SMALL portions, BIG prices. It's equivalent to eg. New York New York, Swensons, Sizzlers price but 20% smaller in portion. Food quality/taste doesn't match the pricing. Items ordered are the Chefs Recommendations eg. Spicy Baffalo wings Chef challenge, tenderloin steak, Chicken and Ribs, Ribs and juices and smoothees.4) The famous Spicy Baffalo wings are simply Fried Chicken Wings with lots of HOT sauce poured on it.5) They offer $15 vouchers but staff aren't very informed of the current promotion. and at the end, despite the OCBC discounts and their in-house vouchers......somehow, you feel you're getting the shorter end of the stick.6) Did I mention that the service is really poor?7) The decorations/ambience is cosy but be careful while walking as some flooring needs repair work, and it's too warm.....that's just my opinion on it
