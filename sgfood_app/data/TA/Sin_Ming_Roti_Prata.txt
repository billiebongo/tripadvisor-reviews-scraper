Prata is served traditional and fluffy. I have been here three times and there is usually a long queue. The nasi briyani and fried chicken are good as well!
Other food items worth trying at the same coffeeshop: corner popiah stall and charcoal traditional toast.

The Roti prata there are still very consistent. Queue starts to form as early as 730 am. We also like the mee goreng as well.

To me, the Roti prata here is one of the best in singapore. The fish and lamb curry is very yummy too. Always long queue and need to go early.

Was expecting a different roti prata experience before heading to Sin Ming.The size of the roti prata was smaller compared to most places and the curry accompaniment is mediocre.My friends and I had better roti prata and curry elsewhere.Can't understand the long queue for something ordinary

A Prata stall that I must visit every time I m back in Singapore! The dough still tasted the same, always asked for plain ones to be done crispy n with a simple chicken curry, you are set for an enjoyable meal! Will try the coin Pratas the next time as I understand they are very good to

I am not a prata person. But this coin prata is magic to me. My first time eating coin prata ($4 for 6 pieces), I was pleasantly surprised at how it isn’t oily like regular prata. It’s slightly crispy on the outside, yet chewy on the inside. It sure feels like I could eat several of this without feeling like I ate a million calories— which, of course, is a LIE. This definitely can’t be healthy…T’was awesome that we came here in a large group; strength in numbers, so we could share several plate of curries to get a taste of all of them! Out of Chicken Curry ($4), Mutton Curry ($4), Fish Curry ($3) & Keema ($3.50), my favourite isthe Keema because it’s something new to me & I liked the texture of the peas & potatoes inside the curry. Apparently, it’s only available on weekends, which is something to take note of

Went to the famed prata shop around sin ming area. There are 3 shops you can try to roam around the Thomson- Sin ming region. Casuarina@pierce, The roti prata house@Thomson and Sin Ming prata@Sin Ming :). Ordered egg and plain pratas. Average prata with good consistency. The prata is slightly crispy on the outside (not as crispy as Casuarina) and slightly thicker inner dough. When cooled, it will become soggy and oily fast.
