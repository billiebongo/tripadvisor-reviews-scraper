Very small menu but done well. Their chawamushi has truffle oil which really works. The curry is great and the service is very thorough. Great experience at reasonable prices.

Too creamy for my liking... definitely my first and last... portion was huge, so if you like creamy curry and you are very hungry, perhaps this would be great for you 👌🏻

After the enjoyable dining experience at Kurama Robatayaki, we are hyped to check out the other restaurants in Nihon Street’s line-up, and off to Tengawa Hokkaido White Curry we go!Everything about this restaurant is based on simplicity: simple izakaya style setting, simple menu of set meals plus sides and simple concept of white curry paired with meat and vegetables. And with nothing elaborate, I can actually walk out feeling satisfied and full after a meal there.We start off with tsukumono, which is pickled cabbages and red peppers, and the crunchy, crisp texture, paired with the simulating taste of vinegar, serves well to whet our appetites. The truffle chawamushi and soup that come with all set meals are full of flavours. For the chawamushi, obviously the flavour comes from the truffle oil. And the good part is they go easy on the truffle oil, just adding a bit for a hint of earthy aroma to enhance the taste without crashing with the delicate taste of the egg custard. And the clear soup is packed with umami of the clams that I enjoy.After savouring the extremely tasty soup, which is perfect for cold weather, I do find that the white curry is more toned down in terms of flavours. But I definitely prefer the white curry here over other kinds of Japanese curries. Most Japanese curries are simply watered down version of Indian curries, so I might as well go to Indian restaurants to get my kick of the day. The white curry puts something different on the table. It is rich with the creaminess of milk and has that slight taste of pepper that makes it a little bit spicier than its Japanese counterparts, which is what I like. I can say the curry here is in a league of its own. The starchy Japanese rice goes perfectly well with the white creamy curry. The fried ebi is fresh and crispy, thus making for hearty treats. While the meat of pork hamburg is soft and succulent.As for the truffle fries, I like the iota of truffle oil lacing the fries at the top. But it is a different story for the fries at the bottom, which are drenched in the oil. Frankly speaking, while it is great to get lots of shaved truffle slices, too much truffle oil can ruin the taste of the food. And the last bit of fries is way too overloaded with truffle oil that it assaults our senses. Though on the third and fourth try of the fries, the amount of truffle oil used is just right.Service is great, being prompt and friendly, and has this izakaya feel to it that makes patrons feel at ease, which makes this place great for unwinding after a day’s work or getting together with family or friends.With the free flow of soup and rice—only applicable if each patron orders a set meal, the set meal is extremely value for money. Needless to say, this restaurant is one of our regular haunts already

Price was reasonable as we bought discount coupons from Fave app; $17+ each pax for Spanish pork katsu with chawamushi, clam soup and green tea. The white curry tasted like normal Japanese curry except for its Color. Variety is very limited. We tried their white curry ramen which tasted like diluted curry sauce. Their hamburger curry has a strong porky smell and patties is on the dry side.

This place is located in Millenia Walk on the 2nd floor. Nearest train station will be at Promenade Station (Blue / Orange Line).This small little restaurant serves some really nice food. They even offer more rice or miso soup upon request which i would say is very generous. Tried the Hamburg and the Chicken Katsu. Both mains were really great and the eating experience is comfortable. The portions are pretty much just nice and was not too big.The Hamburg tastes well with or without their white curry sauce. The sauce texture was smooth and were not too salty. Same for the chicken katsu, the deep fried chicken cutlet was very crispy and it is not very hard. Goes well with their white curry sauce too.The overall dinning experience / service staffs are great. The only small area which i think that needs some improvement will be beverages. The Hot Tea that I ordered is not hot at all. Will definitely be back again soon

My friends and I chanced upon the Tengawa Hokkaido White Curry located on Level 2, Millenia Walk (at the top of escalator) yesterday. According to Bobby who introduced himself as Manager/Shareholder, the eatery has been operating for 9 months already, it then dawn upon us that we had been absent from Nihon Food Street for that duration. The outlet is the first "white-curry" in Singapore.We ordered 3 sets of white curry dishes which we enjoyed thoroughly: curry-seafood ramen, mayonnaise salmon katsu with rice and juicy Hamburger with rice. Each set (priced below $20) came with a chawanmushi and a clear clam-soup. Rice and the white curry soup/gravy was unlimitedly refillable, like the green tea ($1).For customers who wish to have more spiciness, they add the regular red chilli paste/sauce available on each table.The staff were efficient and helpful. All made the effort to elicit feedback on the food politely from us

The first time round, I ordered the Set Z, the pork katsu set and it was fantastic. Today, I ordered Set C, which was chicken katsu set. Both sets were good, but personally I preferred the pork katsu better. The meat is so tender! What is an icing on the cake is the truffle chawanmushi (superb) and the free flow asari soup. This is the first restaurant I've been to which offers free refill of soup. You can even ask for more rice if you need. Fantastic! When they refill your soup, it's not just the soup but it's the entire bowl (i.e. with clams, tofu and beancurd skin). I'll definitely return for a third time

Presentation of the food is excellent, food art. I had the curry udon. Initially was confused whether to add the curry to the udon. Luckily the chef came n explain. I prefer not adding in the curry to the soup, but to dip the udon in the curry instead. The chef very friendly and humorous, he has also stayed in japan for 5 years.  Yummy food to end the day! Will patronise again!

Katsu was excellent and best of all there is free refills for rice. White curry wasn't spicy at all (for those who can't handle spicy well

Saw white curry as their recommended dish therefore decided to give it a try. The curry was nice, portion was big. Worth the price.

This is the 1st time I heard of Japanese white curry. We ordered chicken, pork and prawn sets. It's come with chawanmushi and miso sup. The white curry is very creamy and the chawanmushi is very soft and tasteful. Their miso sup, rice and white curry can be refilled. I like the Ebi set the most and will be coming back. An added point is that their staff are very friendly and helpful. I will recommend my friends to try it out.

I had never heard of white curry before so when we found this place we were pleasantly surprised at how tasty it is! There are limited options but I think that's a good thing - they specialise in the white curry and it pays off. Our favourite place in Nippon Street

Whoa I cannot begin to describe my delight at having found this hidden gem in Millennia Walk. This Japanese eateries had me hooked at the first Chawanmushi.They used truffle infused oil that brings out the delightful flavour of the steamed egg.The hamburger was well done and the sauce was smooth and creamy.The soup they served is freshly made with fashion and not the ordinary miso that is served.Overall a delightful meal.Will go again.But go early as the queues can get start around dinner time

Attracted by the banner on Hokkaido white curry , my family decided to try the restaurant for dinner. Menu is limited with about five choices , so we chose 3 different sets . A curry seafood udon, a fried Ebi set and a tori Katsu ( chicken) . Both the latter set has rice . All sets come with soup and chawan mushi with truffle oil. The table has complimentary cabbage pickles which is crunchy and appetizing . We are happy with quality of food and soup.Service staffs are helpful and polite. When the seafood udon set came, I was advised to drink the soup first before pouring the curry into the udon to eat. Soup is tasty with freshness of mussels and prawns. White curry sauce goes well with the udon too. Will return with friends to try in future.

Very simple menu: three choices: shrimp, chicken or pork patty. I was looking for tonkatsu (pork) but I am picky here because the best was in the plate: the curry was great! Tasty, creamy and complementing very well the great fried chicken I had chosen.The starter in the menu was the chawanmushi which I had never tried in Japan: subtle and very fragrant, it was very good.Staff is very kind and efficient. I would definitely come back on my next stay in Singapore

This is our first time eating white curry and turned out to be oiishi! We ordered the chicken katsu set. The chicken was cripsy on the outside and the white curry compliment the chicken meat well. The chawamushii was good and there is a free flow of white vinegar cabbages which is addictive. I hope there is more to the meni as it is quite limited now for choice. please have tonkatsu (pork) soon!! would love to try that when its on the menu

I came here with my family for a weekend lunch. The truffle flavoured chawanmushi is their signature dish. It was indeed very soft and fragrant at the right temperature.We ordered both white curry main dishes that came with the prawn and chicken cutlet. The latter was surprisingly tender, not dry at all unlike in many other restaurants. The restaurant owner shared with us that all main ingredients used are imported from Japan. It was definitely a great dining weekend experience for us

Came here yesterday with some colleagues for lunch. The menu is very simple with just 3 choices. I opted for the chicken katsu set which was all quite tasty. Extra miso soup and cabbage are available on request for no additional cost. Miso was decent too

Other reviews here and on their Facebook page have done a great job of describing the flavors, smells and visual impact of this curry. I'll just give accolades and an exhortation that you must try this curry. I've eaten my way across Europe, Asia, and Africa. After multiple trips to Singapore, I know that food is a national past time and that trying to pick a favorite food, let alone a favorite place to eat is impossible. However, the Hokkaido white curry at Tengawa is absolutely the best meal of my last (10-day) visit. This falls into the categories of "Where Has This Been All My Life?" and "Makes the 30+ hour travel time from Texas worth it." Zero chance that I will not be making at least one stop every time I am back in Singapore
