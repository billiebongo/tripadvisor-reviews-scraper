Visited the Telok Ayer St outlet to buy a brownie cake for our son's birthday. Decent selection of various brownies available. No problem getting some icing with a happy birthday message. And the best part: the brownie cake was very tasty indeed!

I came across this shop that sells cheesecakes, brownies and cookies. They have been around for 10 years.The owner served us and he was nice to offer us samples of his cheesecakes. The cheesecakes are baked and have no preservatives, no additives, and no fillers (flour, custard and gelatin) in them. There were 4 flavours on offer: Premium Blend, Summer Strawberry, French Blueberry and Singapore Style – Kopi & Kaya. I tried all 4 flavours of the cheesecakes. The ones that stood out for me were the Premium Blend and the Singapore Style – Kopi & Kaya. They do sell their cheesecakes by quarters, where they cut each whole round cheesecake into 4 and sell each quarter individually. Each quarter of a cheesecake costs $12. They have a promotion where you can buy 2 for $22 and 4 for $41. They sell whole cheesecakes at $48. So it’s good value to get 4 quarter cheesecakes at $41, and you can get different flavours to boot!I bought 2 quarters for my family:- Premium Blend: This is the classic cheesecake and there’s a choice of 2 base: Digestive cookie base or a chewy brownie base. I took the chewy brownie base as its more unique. Its good! I also found out that it’s a best-seller.- Singapore Style – Kopi & Kaya: This is a tribute to local flavour, with coffee and kaya (which is coconut and egg jam). I absolutely loved this. If I can, I would eat this for breakfast, cos that’s what a good local breakfast should be! My family loved them.The cakes are pre-packed, so if you don’t open the packaging, they can keep for 3 months in the freezer. Once you open it, you have to consume in a week.They have outlets at Dhoby Ghaut, Telok Ayer and Kovan (new outlet).Recommended

Absolutely won me over. Bought the P.Osh Chewy Brownie and I can't say enough how tasty these are. They are moist, but not overly thick, nor dry and crumbly; the texture is not easily described, but that is why everyone should give it a shot, even people who do not typically eat brownies, like myself. Too small a piece, if you ask me. Normally there must be ice cream if I am ever to be convinced to eat some brownie, but this is on a different level. These kind of melt in the mouth and they do not need help from anything else. Freshly baked brownies with natural ingredients, without any artificial colours, flavours, or preservatives. Individually packed in cute medication bags with slightly-high prices, which is great for me, because it keeps me from buying them too often! Great job, I am definitely going to be a long-time fan

some friends and i have been in singapore for the past week and this is an incredible place that we chanced upon. in the first place, most people miss the subway shops at dhouby gaut when getting off the train, and that is what happened to us the first few days. then one time we were adventurous and went inside and wala, amazing happened to us!you know how a true brownie is rarer than rubies, and we were surely not expecting to find any rubies in that strip of shops. well, this little shop decorated in cool black had the best brownies i've had for since like forever!! straightaway transported back into granny-time when she used to make these type of awesome textured brownies that were simply addictive! and yes, how hilarious to be having it here in singapore of all places.we absolutely loved the brownies, and a couple of friends swore by their cheese cakes. but no, brownies for me still. HAHA!!!!it takes abit of effort to find, but worth it without a doubt. definitely should visit if you are in the area!♥, sarawhhh
