Meet a Friend for lunch at Moi Lum. Decent Chinese set lunch at $9.90+++ add a dollar for drinks which works out to $12.50. Had beef biskets and rice. Comes with soup of the day, fruit of the day

These two dishes we ( total 5 of us) find it the better among the XO fried rice & golden bean curd & veg.
Will go again some other time.... Not so soon.

The Family new year dinner brought us to this restaurant, the crowd was good and the service staff was superb . The signature roasted chicken was out of this world. The Peking duck was great. The steam fish garupah was really commendable. The beef bisquite was very nice. Over all the dinner was just great, strongly recommended

Celebrated grandpa birthday dinner on a sat night. We were a group of 13, quite a squeeze but the restaurant help us with a nice quite spot and getting a combination of chairs and stools to fit us to a large round table.We are hokkien and I think this restaurant started out as Cantonese restaurant. We tried the following:Yam ring, fish maw soup, Peking duck, duck meat with noodles, honey glazed pork ribs in rack (double serving), cereal prawns, 青龙菜，broccoli, roasted chicken, chinese fried pan cake filled with red bean paste and fruits platter. We brought our own birthday cake which was a pie. All the food we ordered was good. The pork ribs racks was voted tops by everyone. It was like eating Tony Roma ribs in a Cantonese restaurant.Service is very good. The staff was very attentive and friendly. Serving us tea, top up and refilling plain warm water for the senior folks. Plates were changed regularly. Helped with servings from main dish to 13 small bowls/ plates. Set up our birthday cake with plates, forks and lighter. Definitely a go to place for folks to celebrate birthdays as we heard at least 4 other tables singing "happy birthday" songs too..... It's a very comfortable place for the seniors and folks who like nice Cantonese and popular chinese dishes. Parking is not to inconvenient with a large open car park along peck seah street. The restaurant is located right at the corner of the junction of peck seah st and Maxwell rd.Plan to go back again and try out other items closer to Christmas with friends

Moi Lum Located at 38 Maxwell Road Airview Building it is a stylishly furnished Chinese restaurant with tastefully ambience, that's found a home on the First floor of Airview Building. Provides a very comfortable dining environment with private VIP rooms catered for private events. It is a distinctive but good up-market Cantonese Chinese restaurant with Good service, and tasty harmonious food. What we really love about the exquisite mouthwatering Chinese cuisine is the usage of fresh, premium ingredients. Some of The food that we ordered such as Peking duck, yam ring with scallops, pork knuckles, 3 egg vegetables, golden coin beancurd, salted egg spring rolls, salted egg prawns, broccoli and mushrooms, with the yam paste, Majestic Roast Chicken, were all tasty and well presented. The price tags are definitely high, but I guess that is the way in Singapore everything is quite inflated. Lastly, thumbs up to the service Staff are very professional the service is excellent and very friendly and attentive. A perfect night. I would highly recommend, I will definitely come back. Very soooon. Awesome!!

This restaurant has a long history. In fact, that history is longer in years than the country of Singapore. I was in for a business meeting, and a colleague ordered for all, but I can definitely recommend the Wasabi Prawns. The restaurant was busy to capacity, but we did not have to wait. The wait staff was VERY attentive

We were invited for dinner here by relatives. Being the first time here, it was real good. I'll day it's real authentic Cantonese food all the way. Food was so good, staff were friendly, ambience was cool, deco was nice. We added roasted Peking duck to our order and it was real tasty. Price is considered mid-range, not too pricey. Definitely won't be our last time here, will come again.

We are a group of 6 classmates, knowing each other for 50 years. To get together once in a while, we celebrate each other's birthday with the birthday "boy" selecting the venue. This time my Cantonese friend chose Moi Lum for a nostalgic dinner. Rather early at 6.30pm the restaurant was initially quite quiet but it soon became packed, probably because of the holiday - Hari Raya Haji. We chose a la carte dishes as the sets appeared uninteresting. Whether this was our mistake, we do not know as we were only able to sample the following dishes: Majestic Roast Chicken, Salted Egg Spring Rolls, Triple Egg Bo Cai, Braised Pork Knuckle, Ee Fu Noodle and Orh Nee to round up the meal. It was a bit of a let down as our expectations were rather elevated with the signature Majestic Chicken over-hyped. Consolation was the finger food Deep Fried White Bait which was really fragrant and gave a feeling of "I want more". Coming to service standard, this was most disappointing, the interval between dishes was too long even after sending reminders. Though we were retirees and had all the time in the world, the long waits made us very uneasy and we could only comfort ourselves that it was a holiday crowd.

my late grandfather used to bring us here but we stopped going coming since he passed away more than 20 years ago. I decided to invite all uncles, aunties back here again for a gathering and it didn't disappoint. We ordered 12 dishes, for 12 of us - and the bill was less than $500, considered a real bargain for what we ordered. We had peking duck, majestic chicken, yam ring with scallops, pork kunckles, beef brisket, 3 egg vegetables, golden coin beancurd, salted egg spring rolls, salted egg prawns, duck noodles, broccoli and mushrooms, with the yam paste, a traditional dessert favourite. The yam paste could have added some pumpkin though but else everything was tasty and brought back fond memories of our time with our grandparents

Great evening together. - and superb Chinese / Cantonese food!
Thank to the kitchen!!! We will come back!

This restaurant was once my favourite when I was young....
The standard still remains...
But ours improved .....
Try the roasted chicken here... And their sharks fin soup... Still ok ..
5
We were a group of 8 family and friends and had a wonderful feast. My father was in charge of the ordering and as he has been coming to this long standing restaurant for many years it was guaranteed that all the dishes would be great. We had sharks fin soup to start and then had pork ribs, stuffed bean curd, scallops and whole fried grouper in a sweet and sour sauce a special poached and steamed chicken that just melted in your mouth and a vegetable stir fry.The service was fast and friendly but there was a reasonable gap between dishes.
4
Enjoyed the dinner hosted by an elderly couple in this established institution. The food and value is still good. What surprised us was the excellent service we received throughout the evening; even though most of the tables were full. The only less than favorable comment I would make is that their Peking Duck was not as good as the one I had in Orchard Road. But then the price is different.If you are driving there, there are more than ample parking at Peck Seah Street

Most likely one of the better authentic Cantonese restaurants in Singapore.We had a lovely lunch starting with the traditional Lo Hei followed by a number of traditional CNY and signature dishes being of course their famous Majestic Roast Chicken, Fish Maw Soup.We enjoyed every dish to the fullest and to end the lunch we had as a dessert mango pudding.This must be one of the best i ever tasted and if it happened by accident or done on purpose is do not know but the decoration was real art!I say try!!

It is my 3rd visit to this restaurant. My favourites are 莲藕排骨汤 (Lotus Roots with Pork Ribs), 豆喵炒带子， Crispy Chicken, 腐皮卷， 炒面线，red bean pan cakes.Prices are reasonable and it is an excellent venue for weekend family gathering and birthday celebrations.Parking is abundant in the vicinity. The closest is the open air car park beside Red Dot Museum

Good old Cantonese fare is what Moi Lum is all about. The Majestic Roast Chicken with its special tangy chilly sauce is truly outstanding. So also their ngoh hiang and the Golden Coin Beancurd, the traditional Yam Pot and the fried Bee Hoon or Crispy Noodleswith Seafood of Garoupa Slices. The Fish Maw Crab Meat is also very good. The sharks fin omelette wrapped with fresh lettuce is also delightful.Service is good, though not particularly outstanding.All in all, a good restaurant serving good Cantonese dishes. And with ample car-parking nearby, it's certainly a value for money eatery, located in the middle of the business district, at the junction of Maxwell and Peck Seah Streets

It's has been 2 years since we last visited Moi Lum, we remembered the foods are delicious and loved their fish maw with crabmeat soup.Their service is excellent, our tea cup are filled promptly after we finished drinking it. The atmosphere is very quiet, unlike the good old days. Today, we are back and we must say it's not as good as before. We ordered treasure fried rice, baby kailan, black pepper beef and fish maw crabmeat soup.1) Treasure fried rice - Something is lacking in this fried rice, fire may be not be strong when frying. The crabmeat seems to be frozen type as it was very dry. 2) Fish Maw crabmeat soup - one dimensional taste of chicken stock soup.3) Baby Kailan - The dish came out is not baby kailan, just local kailan. A little bitter but acceptable.4) Pepper beef - The beef is very tender, not much peppery taste. Worth ordering it. Overall, the foods are forgettable and could get better one elsewhere. Regret that we might not be back again.

Oh how I miss the good old days when dining at Moi Lum was a happy family affair. The Majestic Roast Chicken is still good (a tad raw near the bones), and the re-invented Fried Egg White with Crab Meat remains my favourite, but the rest of the menu is predictable Chinese fare. Service was much better when the young proprietor, Chris, was around. On our last visit there two nights ago, when the restaurant was unusually packed, we were told by our 'favourite' waitress, a proud elderly lady, that the waiting time was 20 minutes. We told her we were prepared to wait, but she retorted with a frown that she doesn't 'like to see us standing here.' We took it that she was telling us to scram, and we did. Across to food paradise across the road, Maxwell Food Centre. Bye Moi Lum, it's been nice dining at yours all these years

The restaurant has been around for very long, but somehow the standard is not as good as in the past. My favourite is still the Fish Maw Sou
3
I was there with family. We're satisfied with the food and the services. It's a nice place to have family meal.
The car parking was easy, you may find parking lot just opposite the restaurant.

Moi Lum is one of the oldest Cantonese Restaurant in Singapore. They still have the old dishes and tasted good. Price is very reasonable but service is average

There are many chinese cantonese restaurants in singapore- many of which are part of big chains. However moi lum seems to be a standalone shop. It is opposite the famous maxwell food centre, the food at moi lum is cantonese. As it is chinese newyear season, the sets are specially created for this period. The roast chicken is its signature dish. It was ok. The wasabi prawns were juicy, fresh and were not too " pungent" as wasabi can shoot up your noses! Spinach was. also goo

We have been to this Cantonese Restaurant many times and most of the times, we are satisfied with the food served which includes roast chicken, salted egg prawn roll and pork ribs, sliced fish fillet with ginger and asparagus with stir fried garlic. The roast chicken came up tops (signature dish) while the pork ribs would have been better if the meat was more tender. The sliced fish fillet dish was ok but would be better if a better type of fish was used

I had dinner with friends to celebrate the year end. One of our favourites is to try some of the classic restaurants which focus more on the food rather than frills. We ordered their signature dishes including the roasted chicken, the gold coin tofu, wasabi prawn, fermented tofu stewed pork with yam and othersThe roasted chicken was the best amongst them while the rest were in my opinion of average taste. Worth another visit but would probably take me a Long time before I enter this place agai

Moi Lum is one of the oldest Cantonese restaurants serving traditional dishes since the 1920s. They have great signature dishes like Salted Egg Springrolls, Wasabi Mango Prawns, Salted Egg Fish Skins and a lot more. Everything I ate there was very delicious. The service was okay and the prices are reasonable. Would definitely go there again when visiting Singapore.

Moi Lum has been around for years according to their signboard. Food is decent , service standards are acceptable. The boss is very polite and tries his best. The restaurant is a favourite among big families especially on weekends. Recommend the roast chicken and hotplate beef/ venision. A hidden gem - suggest that you make reservations during weekends. Do not expect the privacy you get in hotel restaurants. Tables are placed very near to each other but it is a cosy family restaurant, great for old friends' reunions

For more reviews and photos, visit my site hungrybaker.coMy mum was raving about what she exclaimed as “super delicious Peking duck and roasted chicken”, so we trooped down for dinner on a Sunday, with a last-minute reservation made for 1730. Yes it opens for dinner that early, and it was a good idea because when we were midway through our meal, diners started pouring in.As only three of us eat duck, we’re saving our taste of Peking duck when we a return as a bigger group (yes we’re returning, it’s that good!). Would be great if I could stop by on a weekday for lunch too, the set menu looks affordable!We ordered a Red Snapper ($40), cooked with fried chyepoh; half a Majestic Roast Chicken ($16); and a Dried Conpoy with Cabbage ($16). Along with two bowls of rice and dessert, it was more than enough for four people.The red snapper was beautifully cooked, just firm and moist. It was covered generously with crisp, salty chyepoh bits. We ran out of sauce about 2/3 through though.The roast chicken was wonderfully juicy and moist! I have eaten my fair share of roast chicken cooked till dry as a bone (especially at weddings) and this was a nice surprise. It isn’t salty though, which is where the accompanying little platter of salt comes in.The dried conpoy with cabbage was basically an island of cabbage with a sea of thick gravy and conpoy chunks. Mop up the gravy with the cabbage and feel transported to your Cantonese grandma's home at dinnertime. I would like to order the doumiao version next time though, as it seems like it’ll go better with the gravy.The fresh coconut ($3.50) was decently priced unlike the usual $5 charged elsewhere.We will be back! I think the dishes are really good and value for money. There are sets for three to four people for just $70, which amazes me. Would like to try that next time

Since it was Mid Autumn and my father birthday, we (the family) decided to go there for dinner. All of us, found the food tasty, but, to the old folks, it was not like the Old days. My siblings and I also said there are other Cantonese eateries just as good or even better, in regards to the service and prices. Service was ok, they try to accommodate us, but I still find it lacking. We had to ask the foreign hired waitress to clear the used plates and sometimes, we had to take new plates by ourselves. Like any other outlets, one should not go on a weekend or public holiday

We have dined there many times, whenever we have overseas visitors. The business was started by the grandfather, and currently the main chef is the son. The grandson is F&B trained and currently in Indonesia expanding the business.We usually order the Peking Duck which is very reasonably priced at SGD $48. After the roasted skin is served, the meat is usually stir fried with noodles; we requested 'mee sua' noodle, and this is lighter than yellow noodles. An extra SGD $10.A firm favourite is Fried Egg White w Crab Meat at SGD $15; this dish is served w salad leaves (romaine or cos, not sure). An extra plate of salad leaves cost SGD $3. This we eat as wrap for the next dish - the prawns.Another favourite is Salted Egg Prawns at SDG $18; the eight big prawns are marinated/coated with salted egg yolk and deep fried.Our visitors like the dessert Peanut Paste - SGD $20. We usually request less sugar and more liquid.An excellent dessert is Red Bean Pancake at SGD $12; the pancake is crisp and very thin-crusted.Service has always been friendly and pleasant. And we always bring our own bottles of wine.The staff will change glasses each time a new bottle is served.There were 5 of us, but the servings can easily accommodate another 2 or 3 more diners.We try to go on week nights when the restaurant is less busy and the nearby carparks not full.There is a glass walled private room for two big tables of 12 diners each.Reservations recommended

Introduced to this family run restaurant by my brother. Overall, the food was decent but special mention must be given to their "Majestic Roast Chicken". Cooked really well and deliciously tasty. Other dishes are average only IMO and service typical of family run businesses.

This restaurant should be shut down. They put meat and fish in the dishes on their vegetarian menu. If you are lucky enough to be a meat/fish eater then you can look forward to a nice dose of food poisioning. Awful and unforgivable

Came here because my parents were patrons in its older days. Found the food not too bad so returned but this will be the last. The business here is conducted in such an unethical manner it's disappointing. The BOSS took the order wrongly and sent 2 different people to make 2 different excuses before finally coming over himself with the simple goal of forcing us to accept the dish so he would not have to bear the loss. It is sad to see such a traditional business being conducted in such a manner. Then acted like giving is a 20 dollar discount on a 70 dollar dish makes it all ok! Newsflash, I would have been more than happy to pay 70 dollars for for what we ordered and not 50 for what I do not eat. That's like forcing me to buy a dress I can't fit in nor like just because you ordered the wrong stock and can't sell it to anyone else. Terrible

Moi Lum has been in the restaurant business for at least 40 years. Its signature dish is the Majestic Roast Chicken. The chicken is deep fried to perfection with the skin fragrant and crisp yet the meat is moist and tender. The menu has several other dishes which is not bad but nothing to crow about. Service is decent for a typically Chinese restaurant. Proves are reasonable

Absolutely avoid this place. My friend and I went there for lunch to eat some Pekin duck. We boight their whole duck special. We asked them how it was served and they said we had four options, of which we selected the foo noodle one. Result: after cutting the duck skin, they brought it back to the kitchen to add to the noodles. The duck dissapeared, there was less than 1 breast in the whole plate. We aked them to bring it back, they refused and then tried to charge us extra stuff that we didnt order, hiding it on the bill by writing it in chinese. We paid 80$/2 persons, left hungry and angry. DONT GO THERE, THEY ARE THIEVES

Brought here by family who have been here a couple of times. Apparently run by a couple and the wife said hello and took the food orders personally. Even recommended a few dishesThey are known for their Peking duck and crispy chicken so we ordered those. Plus other dishes like spinach with different eggs, a tofu/mushroom dish, and noodles fried with the Peking duck meatThe food was mostly ok, not spectacular. The Peking duck lacked finese and fragrance, the tofu was blah, and the noodles a tad oily. Everything else was fineService was ok. I'm tickled by some of the reviews here complaining about the service. Some of the servers are older ladies and they may be hard of hearing or sigh

Come for my husband birthday and order for set meal..Crab meat and fish maw soup not bad..Majestic roast chicken is quite tender and acceptable..Braised garoupa is best menu according to me.. didn't have fishy smell and cooked perfectly..Prawns with seasonal vegetables is just so so..For the dessert come with tang yuan and white fungus..On top of that we also order fried noodle which we love it very much..Service not very outstanding.. staff not very responsive.

I visited Moi Lum for the set lunch which my colleague and I enjoyed the set meal which is the reason why I recommended to my family for a gathering meal last night. I must say the feedback is good especially the Salted Egg Fish Skin dish is awesome. We had 2 of the same dish. The Golden Coin Chicken is average but the Peking Duck dish is really a good deal since it is on promotion now. We requested the duck meat to be cooked with noodle and my mother-in-law liked it very much. The rest of the dishes like Claypot Tohu are above average as our family members are fussy about the food.The staff served the dishes very quickly and we did not wait long. They accept reservation which makes it easy to request for a table space that can fit a stroller. On the whole the price is very reasonable with a table of 9 persons and we will definitely be going back to Moi Lum again

This is one of the oldest Cantonese restaurants but food is "so so". Used 2 be very good but standards are not like before. They have the virgin roasted chicken, yam ring and lots more. For lunch, they had started an in-between value fare - lunch set to cater to office workers who want a proper sit down meal in air-con comfort but at prices that do not burn a hole in their pockets. Maybe that is why standards have dropped cos it has to ensure food is prepared fast! Food tasted better at dinners though

We had high hopes for the Moi Lum due to their glossy pictures in the Room Service menu. We were so wrong. Only come here if you want food poisoning and vegetarian options with meat in.My partner ordered from the Vegetarian Menu on the menu two items which when they came were clearly not for vegetarians. One stank of fish and was unedible and the other had chicken in! What kind of vegetarian cuisine is that? Non-vegetarian masquerading as vegetarian food trying to fool people to order and then when it comes it's too late to change the order more/send it back - ours too almost 2 hours to arrive.My vegetarian partner complained only to be told that yes Moi Lum did have non-vegetarian options on their Vegetarian Menu!!! In a country where a good proportion of people are vegetarian this is outrageous, a deliberate misleading of the public to buy something under false pretences. They should now be allowed to get away with this. Eventually we were offered the two items free and a $25 voucher, big deal considering our evening meal was ruined by the experience and non-delivery of what they said they would send on the menu i.e. a vegetarian meal for a vegetarian!But i think she had a lucky escape as the three items i half ate not only had no real flavour, were very stodgy, had no sauce (despite one being fish slices in sweet and sour sauce) and gave me food poisoning. I spent half the night being sick/on the toilet as a result of their food.I would advice you not to order from here on Room Service and not to visit their restaurant for any of their "vegetarian options" or anything else. They should not be allowed to treat the public as fools and get away with advertising misleading menu items
