This place was right next to my hotel and so was very convenient for a late lunch. I really liked the dumplings and the servers were very nice. Really enjoyed it.

Delicious, fast and very affordable. The dumpling were very tasty and the staff were pleasant. Traditional Singaporean Chinese cuisine. Dine in or take away available.

It's located just beside my residence hall when I was studying in Singapore. The dishes are average and some of them are not the same as those in China.

I have eaten at this restaurant three times now and never been disappointed. The first time I went simply because I arrived at my hotel late and it was close by. I enjoyed the chicken dumplings and the beef with ginger & spring onions. On my latest visit I had the black pepper pork and it was really good.Service is speedy and the cold beer is cheaper than in most places in the centre of Singapore. I wouldnâ€™t hesitate to recommend this place if you are in the area

I always eat here when staying at BIG Hotel its close its excellent food with an owner who cares and the food is really tasty.Recommended whether you are on a budget or not the portions are large the price is good for Singapore and I rarely go further than this when i need a quick meal

This Sichuan spot sits alongside two Indian based outdoor eateries alongside Bencoolen St.. The menu is a mix of Sichuan and local dishes. I would recommend the eggplant cumin and the cold chicken starter, but have not been disappointed with many other choices. With A big Tiger bottle at $8 this is good value. Black and white striped tables add something extra! Great service too

With a kind and hospitable owner, who always came and asked about the food and service. Good beer, and excellent variety of food at a reasonable price . Conveniently located at the corner of middle street. For a quick late night bite or a work day lunch. Must give it a try

First night in Singapore, this restaurant is just downstairs and around the corner from BIG Hotel.Ordered pan fried dumplings and kung pao chicken - was really tasty! The service was decent, just like another reviewer had said this place is not overly friendly but not cold either.In my honest opinion this is much better than the restaurant right next door

I visited the Rui Xiang for a quick and not-too-expensive dinner and was not disappointed. The restaurant is located very close to the Ibis on Bencoolen hotel and has most of its tables on the walkway right next to a five-lane street, which offers many views, however it is not for everybody.I chose the Sichuan Noodles, a very good soup dish. The broth reminded me in colour and taste of a very well seasoned beef gravy. The noodels and all other ingredients were well cooked, overall the dish tasted very good.The service was allright, not too friendly, but not unfriendly either.To conclude, I can recommend this restaurant to everyone who is looking for a quick bite
