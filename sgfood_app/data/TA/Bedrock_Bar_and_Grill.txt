I enjoyed myself, the place and atmosphere was good, the waitress and service had met my expectation
4
great beef steak, great grill
a nice place for friend and family gathering
no doubt, it is perfect for couples
5
We ordered a ribeye each and a mac and cheese. Ribeye was cooked to perfection. Each slab of beef has just the right amount of fats. The mac and cheese is a pleasant surprise. Served on a hotplate and drizzled with truffle oil.
5
Had booked our table for 4 via chope. Service and ambience were pleasant and the steak was the best.
Will definitely return for more.
4
Dinner here with some colleagues, good quality meat and sides, very fast and kind service. I had an Australian ribeye, could have been bigger. The normal cuts are between 300 and 400g, not too much for meat lovers. Good wines.
5
Went there for dinner. Great steak. Coupled with the nice truffle fries. The bread given complimentary was also nice
5
We had a wonderful birthday dinner celebration at Bedrock. Steaks were perfectly done, and the snow aged beef from the world meat series is really something to shout about! We were led to a small dining room after making reservations in advance, and service was great. We also loved the complimentary naan with garlic and butter at the start of the meal. The main server attending to our table (sorry forgot your name!) was an elderly gentleman who was the most polite and helpful man - helped us take many photos of an unforgettable night! Overall, great experience
1
There are better steakhouses at this price range. Medium rare was more like cooked. And the whole dining feels rushed. Our server can't wait to clear the plates as soon as we finished a dish. Doesn't feel like hotel dining if it was meant to be in the first place. Spend your money elsewhere please
5
Reserves both dried aged beef steaks and had them medium rare and cut. Added the foie gra and white truffle butter as well as the whisky mustard sauce. Yums.Mac and cheese was good and i had a pleasant surprise for a chocolate birthday cake which was superb!Service was outstanding and thankful for the dinner experience
4
We were recommended by the waitress to have the bedrock pepper steak which she mentioned that they had change the type of meat used. And thanks for the recommendation, we had a awesome meal. However, the pepper sauce served was slightly salty. Will be back again soo
5
Used the entertainer app and was entitled for a 1 for 1 promotion! Amazing deal for such quality steaks, would recommend!
4
However, this time round the Naan was served after our steak? We were expecting the naan to arrive, and our steaks arrived 25mins after we ordered. And then the naan came, rushed and doesnt seem right at all. They only apologised swiftly.
5
It's been a year since we last visited Bedrock. Although pricey, we have enjoyed our 3-course lunch. It was a great first lunch of the year.
5
Food was excellent, atmosphere was dim and cozy, perfect for indulging in the melt-in-your-mouth wagyu rib eye. But be prepared for the bill.. Haha
4
Overall great tasting, large portion steak with very nice warm and cozy ambience. Great place for a luxurious meal.
5
Service was good, only thing we didnt like was the dim lighting but itâ€™s no big issue. Food was excellent! My wife who normally cannot even finish 8oz of steak finished all 10oz of her order. And she is already asking when we can go back again
4
I had the US grain fed ribeye along with sides of sauteed mushrooms, truffle fries and shared a lobster tail with my friend. Not one of the best in Singapore, but definitely worth it for the price point. Love it that there was happy hour till 9pm and 1-for-1 for drinks

I am a steak lover.When I read about Bedrock Bar and Grill, I told myself that I must try their steak. Hence, I arranged for a business dinner with my associates on 14 December 2017. I had the dry aged USDA ribeye while my wife and other associates had the bedrock pepper steak.At $99++ a steak, I expected the sauce to be part of the meal. It was not and I had to pay an additional $4++ for the red wine sauce. Despite paying the money for a "quality meal", we were not impressed by the quality of the steak. The seasoning, if any, was not appreciated and the steaks were bland. The cut was poor despite it being a ribeye - the "ribeye fats" was minimal and the steak was tough for a medium doneness.We also ordered a black truffle fries - consistency was a bit on the harder side and the "truffle oil" was pungent at best. I am a steak lover and I also cooked my own steaks. I don't claim to be better, but I have tasted much better than this. Bottomline, will I go back again? Maybe just to try the other steaks, but I am more inclined to take my money and give another steakhouse a chance. Even Aston's serves better steaks at a fraction of this price

Went to Bedrock for our anniversary lunch and pleasantly surprised by a complimentary dessert meant for anniversaries. However, service was mediocre throughout (e.g. soup served without spoon, told to wait till waiter was free before being able to ask for help) - not acceptable for a restaurant of this level. Had the 3-course lunch set with ribeye/petite minute steak and both were underdone by a level, and wasn't impressed by the quality more than Wooloomooloo/iSteaks. May have been more impressed by their more famous peppercorn or tenderloin steaks but wasn't ready to fork out the money without getting a general sense of the food first. Great mac and cheese, and I love the bread, however overall value for money and taste was a bummer
4
The restaurant was nice and cosy with a good dark and woody ambience. Staff were polite and attentive. Ordered the ribeye off the 3 course set together with a char grilled baby gem and a sticky toffee pudding. The heirloom tomatoes were grilled nicely and overall, tasted ok. Same could be said of the steak but surprisingly for a ribeye, it wasn't as tender as one would expect from this particular cut of meat. The server did come round to ask after the meal and offered to change it but I declined. Complimentary coffee was offered to round off the meal, I think in compensation for the steak. Nice touch. Good coffee too
5
Bedrock's steaks and sides never fail to disappoint. Great quality steak for a reasonable price which outdoes some bigger names and prices.
5
The ambience of the restaurant was very good, service staff were friendly and very helpful and the quality of the food was fabulous.
3
First time here.
The set lunch appears to be well worth the money. 3 course. the bisque was a bit diluted. The steak was a bit rubbery for my liking, but love the char and the seasoning.
Desserts were great.
5
had a wonderful dinner at Bedrock. The steak is awesome! the server, Eugene is attentive to our requirements. Great ambience too, just a little bit hot.
5
The food and ambience were good. The very nice service staffs even came with a dessert cake & sang a little happy birthday song after I told them it's my girlfriend's birthday today.
4
It was fast and good service overall.
I ordered set lunch, lobster bisque is too strong fishy smell but overall food was good
4
Brought my husband here for his birthday. Dinner was good, we had the USDA prime ribeye as our main and for sides we had French onion soup, scallops & jamon, Black truffle fries and Mac & cheese. And for dessert we had the Bedrock Black Forest which was not to bad either. Restaurant was a bit hot and stuffy, couldn’t really feel any cool air. Maybe because we were seated at the booth seats, under a lamp.
5
Had the wagyu steak there and it was done to the right doneness I wanted! Flavour was just right.I had made a reservation for 8.30pm but turned up at 7pm. I asked if they could seat us then and they said ok cos they had a table. The only condition was that we needed to finish our meal by 8.30pm, which was fine by me. In the end, they didn't disturb us to leave at the stipulated time cos i guess they didnt need the table. I really appreciate their flexibility to accommodate as much as they could. Kudos to the service team
5
The steak here is always so good. The reason to be here for. Do make sure you make a reservation to avoid disappointment. There are outdoor seatings too. There are 2 seating timing also. It’s a great restaurant for special occasions, business deals and small group of friends meeting up for great steak! They have a variety of rare whiskey by glass! Service is friendly and attentive. Look for Louis if you need recommendation on food or wine!!!

Well ... my comment to this resto is average. Taste of the cooking is okey ( no complaint ). The level ( Medium ) of our steak cooked is perfect , but the tenderness of the “1 kg double cut AGED portherhouse steak” is not as tender as what I thought it should be. I am in meat supllier business for 19 yrs, i know how the aged beef should be. And I a bit dissapointed that no waiter was checking with us of how the food/ meat tasted for this level of pricing structure restaurant. The porterhouse steak was priced at 180 sing dollar, before tax and service. And we even have to ask for refilling the ice water , Service wise I will say is average to low. No smile was seen from most of the waiters. And the steak knife is not sharp enough even to cut our steak. But I should say thank you that they have provided us a small dessert to celebrate my son’s birthday at the end of the meal.
4
Enjoyed a lovely set lunch. Nice ambience, delectable food. I’d ordered a medium rare steak, but it was served medium. Nevertheless, it was still delicious.
5
Steak was great, gotta try the ribeye cap. It was pricey but so worth it! Service was great too, we accidentaly left a bag and they contacted me and kept it safe until I returned to pick it up.
5
Enjoyed the warm service and the good value from the quality steaks here! Back here again one month after the first visit.
5
not able to recall if the black pepper steak was salty the other two times that i had them.. the USDA prime ribeye was awesome, full of flavour as recommended by the f/staff who attended to us throughout..
4
The food was good, the dessert (Black Forest cake) was event better.
Gary was helpful and honest with his recommendation. Very attentive and serving with a smile.
4
The place is ok overall, but perhaps having heard raving reviews about this place, I can't say it left much of an impression. Not sure if there might be diff standards for lunch vs dinner service
5
Do note that during selected days/ weekends they only have 2 standard seatings. Would have preferred that this was made know via the Chope site as we had other plans . Food and service were great . Thank you for the cake arrangement made by the team .

I was there for my birthday celebration with my girlfriend. We loved the atmosphere and the whiskey there, Bedrock carries a decent selection given that it is not a whiskey speciality bar. The whiskies teased my taste buds in a very pleasing manner. Prior to the visit, my girlfriend made some special requests for us and they were executed flawlessly. Kudos to the crew!However, I'm not sure if it mattered that we were seated near the grill, for we both felt that it made our faces unusually oily and that it melted my girlfriend's otherwise resilient makeup powder. Lastly, we were left a little underwhelmed by the quality of the steaks we were served. The meats were not evenly cooked; some parts were almost fully grey with other parts looking very red and raw. Bedrock could be more careful with the meat if it wishes to brand itself as a steakhouse/meat grill speciality. We both felt that we could get better quality meats for the price we paid.
3
Don't trust in Seth Lui blog. Service is great but the steak is so so. They ran out of the aged USDA Ribeye and we had the Australian grass fed Ribeye which was way below expectations of a premium steak restaurant. Black Forest dessert was good though
4
This is a lovely and cozy place, not very big and pretty crowded for a Friday night. We had oysters (soo big, juicy and yummy), french onion soup (must try!), barramudi (a tad too saltish but acceptable, flesh was smooth and juicy) and tenderloin steak (smoky, lovely chew, it was more to the raw side when hubby was eating the thicker side at the end - otherwise 5 stars). The garlic that was served with the complimentary bread is a must-try! The service was prompt and we were well taken care of. Overall, it was a great dining experience and we are already thinking of when to go back. I also stated a comment in the chope reservation that it was for our wedding anniversary and we were given a complimentary desert, without reminders. Very thoughtful indeed. Special night for us
5
Arrived there all dressed up and was shown to a cosy table inside the restaurant. The waiters were attentive enough that we never had to wait and we never felt rushed even after finishing and paying for the bill.
4
We went for a meal to celebrate a birthday, and as usual had a fantastic meal. Cosy and friendly, good atmosphere place!
5
It was a very enjoyable experience, the staffs are professional and make sure that our orders are taken, and our waters refilled. The steaks are cooked very well and according to our preferences. Worth the visit!
5
Great food and impeccable service from bedrock. Every dish we ordered tasted great. Every small detail are taken care of by their staff.
5
great service and good recommendation for us (2 person meal)
we celebrate birthday there and they arrange a nice seating place for us, good atmosphere and we love it!
5
This is our second timing dining here and the steak is really good!! Besides the steak, there are a lot of sides that are worth a try too!
4
The meat was amazing. I had the dry aged rib eye usda and the steak which was done perfectly was juicy and had amazing flavours
5
Being in the fnb industry is not easy, it's hard to please everyone and do well on so many fronts. Fortunately for me Bedrock is one of the rare few which did.Tried the Dry Aged USDA Prime Ribeye and Dry Aged Irish Grass Fed Ribeye. Being dry aged, the beef was tender yet packed with flavours. Since not any Tom dick or Harry can aged a steak, I'd suggest going with this choice when at bedrock. Between the 2, the Irish Grass Fed was significantly tender, and well textured. Topped off the steaks with foie gras which itself was tremendously buttery. Paired this delectable combination with their recommended red wine of the month, Ode to Lorraine by Elderton, which I must admit was a well-curated list. Finished off with some truffle fries which again, didn't disappoint in the slightest bit.Staff was patient and attentive, yet not intrusive. Well the bill came up to $300 for 2 person, but I will definitely be back! It was money well spent
5
Made a reservation for Singapore Restaurant Week and we were thoroughly impressed with Bedrock. I noted in my comments that we were celebrating our anniversary and it would be great if we could have a quieter spot. We were surprised when we got an email stating that they have taken note of our request and would try their best to give us a quiet spot.Fast forward to dinner. Classic Lobster Bisque was not bad. The steak was good. The black garlic on top complements the steak very well. Barramundi fillet was good, albeit a tad too salty. Black Forest dessert came with a "happy anniversary" greeting. That was a very good touch. It was rich and I love the white chocolate cream.Ordered additional Mac and Cheese and I could die happy. It's creamy, but not overly creamy that you wont be able to finish it. It's superb. Wished I had more stomach space so I could devour the entire thing
2
The best part of this meal was the Mac & Cheese ($20++), which wasn't part of the Restaurant Week menu that I was here for.The most disappointing part of the meal had to be the Woodfire Grilled NY Steak which was definitely not the medium rare that both of us asked for. The onion rings were also very ordinary. The black garlic butter on top of it was the saving grace though - it was the bomb... But not enough to change my impression of Bedrock. I believe we weren't the only persons with this issue - another table sent back their steak to be re-done. We didn't bother.The Classic Lobster Bisque with Chive Cream was quite yummy, though I wish it came in a larger portion. I liked the richness of the Bedrock Black Forest dessert (even though the texture of the flourless chocolate cake was strangely very much like a mousse) - it was almost enough to console my sorrowful heart of an overcooked steak. Almost.At the end of the day, this 3-course $40++ Restaurant Week lunch menu was quite a disappointment. First time at Bedrock & it'll probably be my last. Because if a steakhouse isn't able to cook their steak properly........ I don't think it's worth a revisit.Was mistakenly charged $48++ for the lunch menu, which I didn't check as I wasn't the one who signed the bill. Received a call from them a few hours later & an email with an apology & that the refund will be processed immediately. Just thought I'd put this out there.  3-course Restaurant Week set meal Lunch: $40++ Accepts credit cards Air-conditioned seats available☀️ Al fresco seats available Accepts reservations - I used Chope & Dining City Restaurant Wee
4
Good value for money lunch sets though full price on dinner looks pricey. Had ribeye and NY steak - Meat quality was good but a tad too salty. Location is convenient and ambience is reminiscence of a 1980s steak bar.
5
Good food with excellent service! 2 thumps up to the staff, keep up the good work! Thank you so much for the Birthday desert, yummy!
4
Staff was attentive. Food and service was good. We enjoyed the dinner. We are glad that there is happy hour before our meal!
4
Definitely will go back for more! We had a great moment there. I had my birthday celebration with my wife there.
Staff were friendly.
5
Tried their USDA Prime ribeye. The best I had. Recommend to pair with their whiskey mustard sauce. Do save some space for their Apple crumble topped with Vanilla ice cream.
5
Everyone was lovely, my fiance and I had a great dinner and night! The food was amazing too. Would definitely come back
5
Friendly service and really great steaks. Inside setting is very nice and outdoor setting is a great vibe. Very decent drink deals / happy hour and a truffle mac and cheese that is a must (itâ€™s their famous dish). Set in a great location too - near orchard road. Highly recommended
4
The steak was excellent - as per each diner's request. Not to be outsone were the sides, especially the mac and cheese! Don't leave without trying the warm apple crumble! We were there celebrating someone's birthday and the staff kindly took a poloriad for us and gave it to us as a momento.
5
I've been trying to get a reservation at this restaurant for the longest time, and the wait has been worth it! Yummy flavourful steaks that are prepared to the correct doneness. Beautiful sides and the french onion soup is worth a shout too. Cost wise it is great with the entertainer app
4
Despite they are full house on the night that we had dinner, the staffs still manage to give us excellent service and gives a very good recommendations from wine, appetizer, mains and dessert. Special mention to Julie who did a fantastic job and made the night to be unforgettable.
4
Their staff were awesome, friendly prompt and all but they seem seriously under staff. It take quite long to get their attention coz they are attending to other. Food wise: for the price u are paying... its average.
5
Had dinner there with my family. the servers were attentive and took the time to explain their food offerings. Constantly checked on our table to make sure our water are filled or if we need additional condiments. Quality of food was great!
5
Great tenderloin steak, that was tender and succulent despite being such a lean cut. Excellent attentive service.
5
Good food, nice ambience. Bit pricey but good. Love the sides that come with steaks. Easily accessible.

My wife and I recently had dinner at Bedrock on a Saturday evening, after hearing positive reviews from our friends.We made reservations a week early as it was the F1 weekend and we anticipated a busy weekend for the restaurant. I believe they do 2 seatings as we were offered an 8.30pm seating (although we requested a 7pm slot). Bedrock is conveniently located behind 313 mall and just below the Pan Pacific Orchard Serviced Residences. It was pretty crowded on the night that we visited and thankfully we had reservations. The indoor seating area isn't huge but it had a nice warm steakhouse like ambience with dark colours, warm lighting and a smokey smell all around (contrast this with the louder, more colourful and eclectic steakhouse that is Skirt).We ordered 2 steaks for dinner (each around $98) along with two sides (truffle fries and broccollini), along with a glass of red wine to go with the steak. The mains were preceded by a round of warm flat bread (made to order) and accompanied by butter and garlic. This was a different touch from the usual bread basket but personally, we weren't fans of this and would have preferred the usual bread assortment.The steaks and sides came shortly after. The meats were excellent, cooked to perfection, and slightly fatty (the way we like it). Sauces aren't included so you'll have to order steak sauces if u prefer yours with another flavour. The truffles fries were great but the broccolini was really ordinary and we felt that the ones at Skirt was done better. We know the Mac and Cheese is highly rated but we couldn't stomach the carbs that evening and gave in to the truffle fries instead.As you would expect, we had no room for dessert and didn't even look at the dessert menu. Service was above average although it was sometimes difficult to attract the attention of the crew. Nothing to really complain about though. We enjoyed our dinner that evening but honestly felt that certain other steakhouses in Singapore did a better job overall for the price range.
3
Had lunch there again recently and confirmed their steaks not great. Ate there 1st round and didn't enjoy my steak so have not been back since but recently decided to go there for my biz lunch as my client's office was nearby.For the price we paid, I've had better ones elsewhere and even had better ones compared to them at a lower price
5
The reviews I had read are all true. The food was good...and definitely try the mac & cheese, it was super good. Besides that, the steaks and truffle fries were good, and the wine accompanying was good too. Service itself was excellent, tip top and very professional, with a good touch of humour on the side too. So, a definite must visit
3
We have been to the restaurant for many times and I have to say that the service this time round was a disappointment. We arrived before the reservation timing and asked for a table for drinks first. We tried getting the attention of the service crews but for to no avail. This could be due to the heavy crowd that day. When we were eventually seated in the main dining area, I believe the air condition was faulty and we felt really warm and stuffy. However, the service crew was kind enough to solve it for us. However, still an enjoyable dinner as the food was great as usual and so were their wine
4
I made a reservation via Chope and was given a heads up that very likely would be seated outside. To my pleasant surprise, my dining companion and I were given a cozy U-shaped seat inside. Service was attentive and prompt, service staff was knowledgeable and generous with recommendation. Extra sauce was given without additional charge, which was another pleasant surprise. We had peppercorn wagyu which was simply scrumptious with additional chilli oil and chimmicurri sauce. Side dishes of mashed potato and asparagus came in hearty serving and didn't disappoint. The naan and Pinot noir could have been better, but overall the dining experience was really pleasant. To sweeten the deal, there's 1-for-1 main if you use the Entertainer app. Bedrock price tag is still hefty, but I personally find the meal here more balanced and value for money than in Fat Cow or CUT :
5
what strikes first was the awesome service! Good intro and recommendation of the menu and promotion. Used entertainer app but service was not compromised at all. Ordered 2 steaks and the famed mac and cheese and 2 cider which were on one for one promotion. we also had a complimentary cake for birthday celebration and was even given a polaroid! Together with the complimentary flatbread served before our mains, we were extremely stuffed.Will definitely visit again and can't wait to be back to try other dishes
5
Was well greeted from the moment we stepped into the restaurant. Waiting time for the food was a little long but appreciated that the dishes were served altogether. Best mac & cheese and amazing steak, must try!
5
We had the dried irish steak, pepper steak with truffle mash potato and beer battered onion rings on the side. The food overall was fantastic
5
You have to try their Mac and Cheese! It's really nice, too too cheesey, charred just a little to add some crisp taste, and not too strong such that you'll get bored eating it.
4
Loved the ambiance and the service level - got a great recommendation of the wine, fit perfectly with our steak. Food was great as well, especially the mac & cheese.
2
I love steaks and this is truly one of the best I've ever had. We ordered their Irish special menu with a side of mac and cheese. Amazing! Service was great as well. Really love the vibe at the restaurant too
4
Used the entertainer app for the steaks. Unfortunately the prime ribeye wasn't available. Steak was a bit tough but the sides made up for it. Truffle fries, creamed spinach, and mac 'n' cheese tasted great.
5
Absolutely delumcious steak that's worth every penny.
Ambiance was great too although a little packed
5
Service and food top notch as always before. Nothing negative except the sides of my striploin was abit medium wed but the center part was perfectly medium rare the way i like it. My friend's ribeye were perfect
4
I've been here multiple times over the last 5 years. I can safely say that Bedrock is one of Singapore's Best places for a good steak. While they refresh their menu occasionally and sometimes introduce special items, there are a few mainstays worth ordering. Appetizers and deserts are decent but nothing to shout about so keep most of your stomach room for the mains. On their regular menu, make sure to get their dry aged USDA Prime Ribeye or Filet steak. Get the stunning Mac and Cheese. If sauces are required, the unique chilli oil and zesty Chimichurri are the best options.
5
wanted to try the 60 days dry age striploin from world meat series but unfortunately was sold out. went for the ripeye instead but it turns out as one of the best steak i ever had. the steak is so juicy that it doesn't require any sauce to taste every bit of real beef
5
We went for the weekend lunch set meal which is really value for money. good food, good service and ambience.
5
We had our first 3set lunch with nice ambience and delicious steak on a hot plate. Good food and good service.Highly recommended. Hope to visit again.
5
Service staff Chloe made the whole experience amazing. She was extremely attentive and patient to our needs. Thank you.
5
Staffs were friendly and the food and drinks were awesome. The ambience was good too. Will visit again for sure and bring my family there.
4
The lunch sets are attractively priced and certainly don't disappoint. My starter of home cured salmon and salad was exquisite and well executed. I'd ordered the woodfire-grilled NY steak medium rare, but it was served medium. Nevertheless, it was still delicious. I highly recommend the ribeye steak instead. The marbling was fantastic and it was really tender to the bite. I ended my meal with chocolate profiteroles, which were also very delicious. Overall, a great dining experience
1
Ordered a rib eye from the set lunch menu, which was so tough that it can't be cut through with the knife. Had to ask for a change of steak knife. Food was just way below par. Perhaps they use lousy cuts for their set lunches. I'm not sure. Definitely will not be heading back there again. Service staff were great. They did what they could. Just a disappointing meal.
4
Ordered the bedrock pepper steak and the dry aged striploin from the world meat series. The former was juicy, but the latter was unfortunately a tad too tough for our liking. The complimentary bread and mac & cheese was also excellent, but the sautÃ©ed mushrooms were nothing to shout about. Prices were ok since I used the Entertainer app
3
Visited for a business lunch. We had the set menu which is great value at 3 course for 58SGD. The start selection was a bit heavy on fish for me but the Wagyu Minute Steak was extremely tasty and flavoursome. The profiteroles were still a little frozen and so a bit disappointing.
5
Such a lovely place to eat at. The staff were very professional and engaging and so polite. It is pricey but it's worth the tomahawk steak and everything else we ordered! The staff overheard my dad wishing me a happy birthday and had cake delivered to me at the end of the meal which was really sweet but we were charged for the cake which is cool but for what we paid, it should have come free because what if i didnt want to eat the cake (as it wasnt ordered) if you know what i mean hahah x
4
Bedrock Bar and Grill is conveniently located outside 313 Somerset and I particularly like their free range pork porterhouse coz it's tender, soft and juicy. The warm pita bread was soft and one can request for additional portion.We also tried the twice cooked boneless beef ribs but it was a little too tough for my liking.Price wise, it's above average but if you have the entertainer app, they have one-for-one deal. Also, if you order 2 sets of happy hour drinks from 3-6pm, you will receive a complimentary Mac n cheese
4
Food quality is very good. The irish special steak was exceptional. Take it medium as recommended. My son enjoyed the Mac & Cheese.
4
Have a good meal. The service is great too. However I found the steak a bit dry. But overall it is a great place to dine.
5
Started with happy hour..then followed with a great dinner and service. The steak was cooked to perfection.
5
Great food & good service! Steak was impeccable & the bread was really gd too! Will definitely go again!
3
Just celebrating my Husband birthday on sat at bedrock after few struggles to choose between them or celebrity restaurant at MBS. After looking at some feedback with good review we decided to go with this restaurant. Kind of a disappointment with the 'miscommunication ' in their porter house steak is not available from a waiter but after we decided to cancelled all our orders it became oh! Is available ?! The steak is not as to our liking esp with the price - u can anytime choose a good one elsewhere! The restaurant did tried to make up their mistake by giving free beer we ordered - noted with thanks but still don't think will go back again 
5
This is a good US franchise steakhouse nonetheless but i think they are pricing themselves here a bit on the high side. There are better values elsewhere as competition here is quite keen for fine dining western restaurant. Service here is fabulous & they keep good records of all their clients and even my whisky for more than 6months
2
Disappointed in Bedrock. The service and atmosphere was nice but everything else was a let down. For the price you'd expect the steak to be amazing and it definitely wasn't. I had the tomato soup which was boring and my husband had the Caesar salad which was good. The truffle fries were my favorite item we tried. I'd skip this place if I was you. Overpriced and overrated!!!
4
I like the atmosphere and the location is central. The service staff was very attentive, greeting me after a visit to the restroom - welcome back which is really the details that count. Food isn't too bad and portion is big. 400 GmbH ribeye. Favored by Americans and locals.
4
Warm , friendly and attentive service . The manager, James , made the effort to explain the menu to us. James did check with us once if everything was okay during our meal. Dark and classy ambience. I was given the semi - circle booth without being asked. The seat was comfortable and I could relax. There were many office people having their lunch at Bedrock. We have two steaks and a starter. My son had the USAD Prime Grain-Fed Ribeye Steak 400g for $96 and I had the USAD Prime Dry Aged Ribeye 300g for $99. My son and I asked for medium rare. The steak was red but there was no blood oozing out. The steak was cooked in the accurate temperature.My son's steak was more tender but slightly less favourful. My steak was slightly tougher but more flavourful. They are some of the better steaks I have in Singapore. We could choose one sauce for each of our steak. My Son had the Classic BÃ©arnaise Sauce and I had the Wholegrain Whisky Mustard. The first choice of sauce is free. The mac & cheese had a strong pleasant aroma when it was placed on table . The aroma just wafted to my nose. The dish is creamy and smooth without being overwhelming salty. The layer of cheese was well roasted but it could be scrapped off from the pan easily. It was really well-prepared. The steaks and the mac & cheese were served on a hot pan. I spent $144 with taxes for 2 steaks and a mac & cheese. The price was after getting a one for one steak using the Entertainer app. It is a high end posh restaurant to me. I will dine at Bedrock on special occasions.
4
After eating at every high end steak restaurant in Singapore we thought we better try this restaurant. We were not disappointed at all. Started of with a tomato salad that was brilliant followed by their signature Bedrock Steak with Pepper Sauce. One of the best steaks I have had in Singapore. The only let down is the location and the ambience, 5 star food in 3 star environment, that's why I have given it 4 stars not 5

Great food, good ambience, awesome service! Great Value for money - set lunch. Had my business lunch here. Great thing is they have vegetarian options as well.

We took a fish and a burger, and the burger was overcooked, almost burnt and barely eatable. The fries were overcooked to. The fish was quite good but nothing special. Overall I find the place very expensive for what it is.

Their beef is ok. Nice and juicy. But I still prefer Japanese Wagyu....
Service is ok.
Ambience is nice.

At least a very good steak. No doubt about it - perfectly cooked, but that alone doesn't constitute an entire meal. The sauce is just as vital and here they failed.I ordered a pebercorn sauce and it tasted of absolutely nothing. It is supposed to have just a slight edge and taste of pebercorn. Nothing!They were out of rocket salad with parmasan - so we got a ceasar salad instead and fries. Both were ok.The service is present, but very eager to take our order and get you on the way.All in all the price simple isn't jusified compared to what you get

Went there on Saturday night, ordered the following - French onion soup (superb, have not taste onion soup this good for a long time) ceasar salad (average), roasted bone marrow (worth trying, but if you don't like jellied stuff, you can't take this),truffles mashed potatoes (fantastic),Dessert creme brule (average). Beef - aged Australia strip lion 240gm ($74) (asked for medium well, but it comes pretty raw, meat was very tough) and US aged ribeye ($99)(this came as requested medium rare) but felt too much fat, so after half way through felt too oily. Ambiance - seated indoor. Poor ventilation, suffered terrible nose block, felt suffocating, so you can imagine half way thru we just want to get it over. By the end we almost rush out of the restaurant to breathe. Service - through out we have only Anne attending to us. She is lovely and attentive but it will be perfect if she alert us on the portion of the food and tell us we can actually share 1 order of beef instead of ordering 2. But besides telling us what is good she just dutifully take down our whole lots of order. Fine dining like this I expect some personal touch. We end up not finishing our food (I am a anti food thrower) struggling to finish as much as we can, the feeling is disgusting. Though she did ask if we want to pack the left over. A whopping $347 with no liquor consumed ( we did ordered 2 non alcoholic cocktail) and not enjoying but to force feed in a suffocating environment, will I go back again? NOPE! I will miss the French onion soup though.

I've been in Bedrock 5 times and they never failed to amaze us with quality food and very good service. The steaks are always consistent for its good quality and their signature mac and cheese never failed to amuse me. There are a plenty of reasons why I keep coming back to this restaurant. One is the ambiance, they have booth seath which are good for dating couples. They have a private room also which is good for big group or big families. I recommended them to my colleagues for our Christmas Party last year and Im happy they liked the place. They love their famous tomahawk and mac and cheese. The service staff were always attentive to our needs and request. For those steaks or non-steak lovers you should try Bedrock next time.

Having heard that Bedrock has one of the best steaks and mac & cheese, my friend and I decided to go for dinner. Considering the price of the food we expected not only to get good food but also a nice dinner experience; a place with a nice ambiance where we can indulge ourselves in the food, drinks and good conversations, after a week of hard work.I made a reservation for 7pm on a Friday. A decent time after work. We arrived at 7.02pm and got seated at the back. We received the menu immediately and they offered water. The ambiance at the back is not that great. It is a bit isolated. Good for a group of ppl. So we asked if we can get the boothseats, but they told us that they were reserved. Too bad, but fine, because we didnt indicate that during the reservation.We took our time to check out the menu and discuss what to take. We also asked some advice from the waiter. After a while we ordered and then they told us that the boothseats are available due to a cancellation. So we changed table. We thought we were lucky. After we sat there a waitress told us that we have to end/leave at 8.30pm. I thought she was talking only about the boothseats but no, the next seating is at 8.30pm and we have to leave the resto then. I looked at my watch and it was 7.35pm. I was surprised, firstly about the fact that there are seatings in such a restaurant where you pay 100sgd for only a steak and secondly, that they accept reservations where ppl only get 1.5hr from the moment they enter till they leave the resto. What kind of experience is Bedrock intending to give to the guests? As a side note, it was not clearly indicated on the website that there are two seatings and the start and end time are not shown. Otherwise i would have not made the reservation at 7pm. Such dinner will take at least two hrs. It was impossible to have 2 or more courses or have a coffee after. Luckily we just ordered one course. The steaks and mac n cheese were served within 15min. But still, by the time we finished the food it was around 8.20. We were not even slow eaters. And then we wanted dessert, but we only had 10min. So we decided not to order and just sit there, have a talk and finish the drinks, till they kick us out. We were able to steal some time and at 8.40pm a waiter presented the bill while we didnt ask for it.This treatment or policy makes us feel like they only care about selling as much tables as possible in an evening at the expense of the experience of the guests; expecting the guests to gormandize the food and chug the drinks and leave, like in a foodcourt.The difference is that the foodcourt would cost us less than 10sgd and here 260sgd.Nonetheless, the quality of the steak was good and the mac n cheese is sublime.Unfortunately, my steak was half medium and half medium rare. And i wish the knives were sharp.The service was average. Dont sit outside if you find the ambiance important.I will not come back again (maybe for the mac n cheese:D

I was looking for a good steak restaurant close to my hotel on Orchard Road and read a review of the Bedrock Bar & Grill.Within walking distance of the hotel in an alley that is wall to wall restaurants. Bedrock has an indoors seating area and an outdoor one to people watch from - which was my choice.I tried their pepper steak - which is an unusual cut - Ribeye Cap and asked for it to be done pink with no blood with a rocket and parmesan salad and truffled mashed potatoes paired with the happy hour red - which was the only regret of the evening - my fault for being cheap!The steak was done to perfection and the rest of the meal, bar the wine, was up to the same standard and made up for them not having the dry aged meat on the menu.If you don't mind the noise and crowds overflowing from all the restaurants around you - not a bad place for a decent steak dinner al fresco
1
That the restaurant was understaffed was an understatement. We almost had to scream just to be attended to. It does not help that the music was too loud. The classy joy this bar & grill promises did not show up!When I asked a staff a 3rd time if they could serve some bread to my guest who had arrived later, he assured me with a slight annoyance that he had already "ordered for the bread"!!Kitchen operations team was equally understaffed. It took 50 long minutes for our steaks and side dishes to arrive. Sauces and a side dish were wrong from what we had ordered. For the prices charged, the quality of the steaks was a terrible letdown. Our medium well was a little carelessly rare and well done was achieved through slicing through the tenderloin's thickness into a "butterfly" as the staff called it. We had patronized a renowned steakhouse 3 weeks ago; the juiciness of my well done crusty-on-the-top-tenderloin was preserved without its thickness being halved! For a bill amounting to $380 without alcohol for 2 adults and 1 child, the complimentary meagre pudding for my birthday guest was a ludicrous gesture. I was utterly embarrassed. We were given 10% discount and complimentary tea to compensate for the long waiting time. It was a bumpy birthday dinner paved with roadblocks. The restaurant is positioning its brand and pricing strategy against the finest players in the market but the stark disparity cannot be dismissed.It is just simply not guests-centric.

Came here for business meal after hearing golf remark of this restaurant. When we order the dry aged beef at the time of 7pm, waiter said sold out and what a disappointment to my customers. My customer end up chided the typical sirloin and I chose the lamb rack. I ordered medium rare but lamb rack served with medium. Food quality is sub standard and the Service is great I won't come again for sure.. it really over rated in my view

Set lunch was value for money. 3 course set lunch for $38++. Food was delicious and the ambience was nice. Would go there again!

Had been for a company celebratory event 5 years ago and had enjoyed the experience then. Dined there with family a few weeks ago and was very disappointed. Ordered steaks (thats what its famous for) and it was very average with absolutely no presentation at all. They just served up a plate of meat with not so much as a green leaf, a potato or a tomato to make the appearance look good. My wife ordered fish which was not great either. Its not cheap by any standards, lacks buzz...would not recommen
1
I was happy to sit down for a glass of wine, but after that there was no service. My biggest concern was that they were trying to charge $14 per oyster! I love oysters and I eat them quite frequently. I also have been working in the hospitality industry for for then 10 years, and still do, so I know the value of oysters. I would have ordered food and oysters but you guys really need to do a reality check.
4
We went with two friends (so 4 of us total). The portions are big enough that you can order 2 steaks only and have them cut those in half to share, which is enough. The side dishes are tasty too, I recommend the mac n cheese and truffle mash. Sauces are pricey for what you get. Service was really good throughout. The house white and the Suntory beer were stateless, but the red wine was excellent. Again, a good place for a good steak with friends
5
Definitely consider Bedrock for great steak and good drinks. Prime USDA beef steaks are consistently good across multiple visits. Hand chopped burger, grilled tuna and beef ribs are also good. Sides are a mixed bag, mac and cheese is good but most of the vegetables are average. Good drinks with an especially nice whisky selection and good cocktails. Ambiance is classic American steakhouse, dark and subdued. Service solid and friendly

This place is awful. One of the most horrible dining experiences I have had in years.We had confirmed reservations, 3 days ahead of time, for a Monday night.1) We arrive at 630, there is only 1 other table of people there. The whole restaurant is empty. The table we are given is the very first booth at the entrance. And the design of the tables is such that this booth is squeezed in, and doesn't really fit the room. Meaning our bench is like just a few inches away from the table. So an adult sitting there is squeezed up against the table. Awful.2) After saying we can't possibly sit in these benches, all 4 staff there give us completely blank looks and stares. Like we were speaking another language or we were from another planet or our request was so outrageous. We asked to be moved to another table. We ended standing for 15 minutes (again, the restaurant is empty) while they sort of kind of figure out what to do. They suggest The Private Room, and I'm like, well what does that mean, is there a larger minimum charge, or how? Again, blank stares and no explanations. Seriously, are the staff even trained? Is this all their first day at work? Are they really all part-time student staffers?3) Finally they seat us down in the back area. Tables are black color. Gross right? An expensive fine dining restaurant with BLACK color tables? No tablecloth... Obviously they do it to hide the dirtiness and they are too cheap to spend on tablecloths.4) Prices... Absolutely outrageous. 95 bucks for a ribeye. And sides? 28 bucks each, no kidding. And not big portions either.5) Their house specialty is the bone marrow. I had it... It seemed really oily, but since I paid for it and its their specialty, I ate it all.6) Bill for 3 adults, NO ALCOHOL, came in at $500+. Insane!!7) I had diarrhea all night.Horrible service, mediocre food, insane prices. Its clear this place is a huge ripoff, targeted mainly at tourists. The only thing good about it is its name. Trust me, don't go to this place

I'm not saying the service is not good but they rush you to get outta there while you're still enjoying your drink. They tend to give you the bill even if you haven't asked for it yet (I was there for only less than an hour - believe me I checked). Apart from that, food is great and ambiance inside takes away the chaotic vibe from the outside

Was deciding between giving a rating of 3 and 4 and eventually going with 4 stars as I don't think Bedrock should be penalized for the service of 1 wait staff while others have shown great service.We came for dinner to celebrate a birthday and were seated at the back of the indoor area. Staff greeted us along the way and were very welcoming. The seating inside was cozy and slightly dark due to the lighting and dark furniture. My husband and I arrived later than the rest of our party and were promptly given menus by James, who had been in the middle of explaining the various types and cuts of meat to the rest.I declined mine as the menus took up a lot of space and I'm used to sharing with my husband when we sit on the same side of the table. The menu was not that extensive anyway (we'd already taken a look online before coming). James insisted I had my own menu so 'each person can have one'. I was slightly irritated due to a similar experience in Milan (see my review for Paper Moon), and took the menu from him, but closed it and put it on the table. I don't see the issue with someone not wanting a menu of their own!Thereafter, based on the meats we selected, he recommended their doneness. I did not take his recommendation for mine (medium) due to health reasons and chose to have mine well-done (though I usually take medium rare on the rare occasions I eat steak).I'm not sure whether it was these 2 'slights', but when he served our warm water, he moved my knife a little noisily from the coaster to the table - by that I mean he banged it down rather rudely. Before that, I had been wiping my utensils with the napkin and placed the knife back on the coaster as that was where it had been before I removed it! Certainly, the way he moved it was as if it had been elsewhere and I'd put it there to 'block' the water (??).Looking at the rest of my table after the water had been served, at least 2 others had their knives untouched on the coasters. While this may seem a small issue, having worked in the service industry in my student days, I felt this was rather deliberate and uncalled for, especially in a place like this!Meal went well otherwise. We all ordered Australian grass-fed striploins or ribeyes. A complimentary warm naan-like bread was served with garlic and butter that went down very well. A wait staff asked if we would like more and we all did not hesitate to take another each!Only grouse by some in our party was that it was a little difficult to cut the meat. Although I don't usually take well-done steaks, my striploin was still relatively juicy and flavourful, not to mention easy to cut (compared to the rest, who had theirs medium)!5 sauces came with the meats - red wine, bearnaise, chimichurri, chilli oil, and mustard (not the typical mustard; it looked like the chilli as it was mainly mustard seeds - this had whisky and so I skipped it). Loved the chimichurri, which tasted like something I'd eat with chicken rice! While extra sauces are chargeable at $4 each, we managed to get another mustard since there were a no. of us. The steak is nice enough on its own, but I wouldn't have minded more sauce - at least 2 sets of these would have been more reasonable for 6 of us!We also ordered 2 bowls of truffle fries for sharing - fragrant and crisp. Best eaten hot, so we were at a dilemma what to eat first since it came at around the same time as the meats! The meats came in hot cast iron plates and we were warned by the wait staff to be careful - didn't catch her name but she was so poilte, saying 'you're welcome' and smiliing at us when we thanked her. It might seem strange to mention this, but it's surprising how many wait staff don't acknowledge thanks in other establishments!We were so full by the time we finished that we declined to look at the menu for desserts. When we left, James was there to bid us farewell but he completely ignored me (looking straight past and above me - note, I am relatively tall and there are no stairs in Bedrock) when I walked by him, while shaking hands and smiling to some others in my party. Other staff who did not attend to us thanked us as we walked out of the place.Overall, a nice place (maybe not for families, but more for friends or couples due to the ambience); food was without fault and service only unfortunately having to be marked down due to 1 of the many there (then again, it only takes 1 person to ruin the experience and 1 incident to make people swear never to return). For a place like this, it was disappointing to be attended to by someone like that - again, I might have to 'blame' my own experience as a wait staff for noticing small details, but it's not something you would expect when you're paying such prices

Went with my Wife to relax and enjoy good food. The moment we stepped in, we found the atmosphere quiet and pleasant, a world away from the busy Orchard street. Their staff are readily available and serve with a smile. They would not hesitate to give recommendations. We tried their lunch set. We would recommend trying their Lobster bisque and cured salmon salad. The ingredients simply feel refreshing. They did not need to add much seasoning so that you can feel the freshness of the items and how they work together to provide a tasty salad. I do not need to talk about their steaks since this is what they are famous for. Rather I tried their Baked Barramundi with asparagus and sun dried tomatoes. Everything is done to perfection. The skin is crispy and the meat is juicy. This is what I would look for in a successful and well executed baked fish which is amazing given that their forte is in steak. All in all a wonderful experience and we would not hesitate to visit again.

Take a look at the photos that I have uploaded and I am sure you will drool! Service was great and food was good. I love every food items that we have ordered. I really enjoy the flat bread that's served with butter and garlic so much that I was tempted to accept the offer of another piece. However, I didn't as I don't want to be full before the main course was served.This restaurant is definitely worth a repeat visit
4
Lunch menu is excellent value for 3 courses. Steaks cooked to perfection and great desserts too. Very surprised it's not busier and lunch time but can't complain as it's easy to get a seat. Service is quite and pleasantly discrete
5
Fantastic steaks. Never disappoints. And the mac and cheese is out of this world! Service is always on point.
5
Fresh bread w baked garlic excellent. Excellent quality of food. Love the steak, truffle fries, foie gras! Excellent service!!!!
Entrance to restaurant not prominent. Definitely will go back again.

Popped in here for a few beers this afternoon with a friend visiting Singapore. Quite reasonably priced but no food available in the afternoon. 6 Asahi dark beers for $56.

We made our reservation for a Monday night and we're able to push it by 30 mins when we realised traffic was bad.Recommend that you leave plenty of time if driving. Orchard Rd and Orchard Boulevard are especially bad in the evenings. It was raining when we arrived and staff were on hand to escort us into the restaurant as the entrance is strangely not covered by the surrounding shopping malls. Spinach was average - too watery for our liking. Ribeye was cooked to medium as ordered. Tenderloin was not cut to a consistent thickness so was medium in the middle but well done at one side. Mac n cheese was the star.This is our second visit to Bedrock and we felt the quality of food wasn't consistent. The last time we were here, the ribeye was overdone and the tenderloin was perfect. Last time the mac n cheese was okay and the spinach was quite good. Some have complained about the service but we felt we had the right amount of attention. The food all took an awfully long time to arrive - more than 30 mins from the time we ordered. However, the bread and drinks did arrive beforehand but still took about 10-15 mins after we ordered. The trick to dining here is probably to use vouchers or the Entertainer app which gives you 1-for-1 steaks. Probably not worthwhile to over-order side dishes... Mac n cheese is all you need... if everything was served consistently and at top quality, I'd pay full price. Given the inconsistencies, a 50% discount is still good value.

It's great to be visiting Bedrock again after our move two years ago to Malaysia. This time with my kids and in-laws! It was a Friday evening and looking at their crowd, I was a little worried that the food and service standard would have dropped, looking at the review written by others. The settings of the restaurant seemed to have changed but it was still cosy as they arranged our group of 4 adults and 2 kids in their private room. We had the bone marrow and jamon to share as starters. The marrow was indeed a bit too oily, but still good and the jamon, still as good as what we had two years ago! We ordered their Tomahawk steak for our main - it's a long-bone ribeye sliced to share across the table. Very tender and flavourful, as the staff said that its a F1 wagyu - kind of like a mix breed. The birthday man (my father in-law) was greatly satisfied with his huge chunk of meat and was chewing onto the bits on the huge bone. We ordered two mac and cheese for the kids and they loved it! The waiter even asked if we wanted it without truffle as some kids don't take truffle. That was very helpful as my daughter does not like the taste of truffle. We ordered the waffle to share for dessert and much to our delight, it came with a candle on it! And a birthday song! We did not even mention there was a celebration. When asked, the lady waitstaff said they overheard the kids wishing their grandpa - now, this is real attentiveness. The staff even encouraged the kids to sing along and took a polaroid photo of us! That was such a nice touch and gesture. We will definitely be back again as the family enjoyed so much. Thanks to the Bedrock team for making this visit so memorable for the second time! Thumbs up

I have been wanting to bring my husband to Bedrock for his birthday for the past 2 years but its the review of poor service written by others that stopped me until I figured i should at least give it a try myself since the food looks really good and my husband is a big lover of steak. I made my booking a month in advance to reserve for a cosy booth and as expected, i was given a timing of 6-8.30pm for Friday dining.It was raining and because of the jam, we only reached at 7.30pm. I was expecting the reception lady to tell me that i have to sit at the alfresco area but she very kindly extended my dining time to 9pm. So i thought 'great, 1.5hrs should be more than enough time'. She led us to our booth and left us there. We looked around and waited. And waited. We were baffled, and wondered if anyone was going to come and give us a menu or not. After about 15mins, my husband managed to catch the eye of what looked like the head staff who headed over and gave us the menus. After proceeding to let us know what wasn't available, he left. We chose the steak, closed the menu and waited. And waited. No staff looked into our direction; they were either huddled together at the ordering station or just weren't looking at us. Another 15mins passed before we managed to flag another harried waiter. We ordered a whisky cocktail for my husband, water for myself, a porterhouse to share, truffle fried, mac& cheese and 2 onion soups. So we waited in anticipation for the husband's whisky to arrive as he is a huge whisky fan.10mins later, the soup arrived. The onion soup was great, beefy with melty cheese on top. Strange, i thought, where is the complimentary bread? Just as we were finishing the soup, the bread then arrived. After 5mins, the whisky finally came. No water for me. I asked for my warm water and the waiter promptly left and came back with 2 warm water without even asking if my husband wanted warm in the 1st place. The steak came, one half tender and soft, both bland and tasteless. the steak knives were the worst we have ever used. We were both sawing away for dear lives and the steak wouldn't yield. For those who have been to Bedrock will know that the knives are not the typical steak knives with jagged edges. By then, we were totally dejected and i was really embarrassed that i have brought my husband to a place that he is not enjoying at all. The only saving grace was the mac & cheese which was a delight. We didn't even finish the steak and by then, it was already 8.30pm. Again, it was another 15mins wait to catch someone's eyes for the bill and a top up of water. It was really frustrating because there is no system at all and the waiters were all over the shop. I was still waiting for them to send out the birthday cake for my husband that i had arranged before when it was 8.55pm.Granted the waiters were friendly but for a restaurant like this on par with Morton's and Ruth Chris, i will expect a certain standard. No asking for beverage first, the food comes before the drinks is a major mistake that shouldn't be made for a restaurant like this. If you want to impose a time limit for dining, then you jolly well make sure orders are taken briskly and efficiently so that diners can dine properly instead of looking at my watch the whole damn time to make sure i finished before i get kicked out. And for a place that pride itself for the awesome steak, you have seriously disappoint me. When i finally got my bill, the head waiter can see i was pissed as i had asked for the comments card. He offered me a 10% discount but hey, i would have paid the full price happily if you had let me give my husband a birthday to remember by. Of course, my husband says 'i will not come back again'

Had a couple of drinks and the fish - Barramundi. Was very well done, sauce mild yet full of flavor, potatoes reasonably fresh tasting, nicely presented and nothing to complain about. Dessert (churros) was so so. The sauces were good. Good selection of whiskeys for a grill - almost like a dedicated whiskey bar. But prices are high for the good ones, you might as well have a dram or two elsewhere and then come for dinner. Talking of dram, the pour size here is 30ml so bear that in mind!Service was good, polite and timely, But being weekend the indoor seating was filled up so was seated outdoor. Felt a bit like eating in one of the fast food cafes with a thousand people walking past every minute. That took away a lot of the premium feel until you see the bill. Perhaps they should offer dual pricing for outdoor and indoors. Moral of story - reserve! Overall, nice place, good to visit but in case I didn't mention that, look out for indoor seating.

Went there for a business dinner with a client.French Onion Soup consisted mainly of the course outer onion skin. After a few spoonfuls gave up. So stodgy.My dinner guest had the Smokey Tomato Soup, which tasted burnt, rather than smokey. Also left after a few spoonfuls.Mains were also disappointing.Steak was good quality, but it should have been at $89. Was cooked medium rare instead of the medium well ordered. The other main, the Yellow Fin Tuna was nicely seasoned, but was floating in oil.The staff were going through the motions with no one properly running the floor.Table next to us also returned their mains due to being overcooked.I eat regularly in Singapore and this for the price paid was really poor. Better options elsewhere

I've always wandered past this restaurant , but never tried it . First time in there , and wow the ambience is amazing . Had the usda dry aged ribeye and it was wonderful. The MAC and cheese to die for ! Something about the MAC and cheese that I would wanna go back Everyday for . James , the person who waited on us was attentive , not pushy and honest about the reccomendations ! Really appreciate this kind of service . Would definately come back again for the food !

Came here for the Ribeye steak, on the back of a friend's recommendation. And they did not disappoint. Very good steak, and their highly-touted Mac and Cheese was excellent!

We come here every other month to have steak and mac and cheese. Staff were always attentive and courteous. The Mac & Cheese is definitely one of the best in town.

Ok, I need to say we never actually made it to this "restaurant", so I can't honestly comment on the food. I can, however, comment on our treatment leading up to our dinner time...1.) We made our reservation a week in advance, online. Bedrock eventually replied via email, confirming our reservation and admonishing us the first of what would turn out to be THREE times that we had to be out of their fine establishment by 8:30. Fine. The troubling bit is that they could not even take enough care to get my gender correct. Is that too much to ask, or is it now normal to refer to a man as a LADY in careless emails by disinterested employees these days?2.) The day of our reservation, I received a text message from Bedrock asking us to confirm our reservation. Fine. The problem this time was that they did not even care enough to get the members of our party correct. Sliding downhill rapidly in the confidence department. Do we really trust these people to properly prepare food which we are actually going to put into our bodies? We are VERY nervous...3.) At no fault of the "restaurant", there was a bad accident and the dreaded Massive Jam sign on the CTE, which had become what was basically a parking lot. Given that we had already been admonished by Bedrock THREE times that we simply must be gone by 8:30 (our reservation was for 7:00), we concluded that it was going to be impossible to arrive at an hour decent enough for us to (hopefully!) enjoy our meal and comply with their precious departure time, owing to the unforeseeable Massive Jam on the CTE. Ergo, we phoned the "restaurant", attempting to inform them of our dilemma, hoping to re-schedule our reservation. Amazingly, (maybe not so much, really) no one bothered to even answer the phone. Instead, we were routed to an answering machine which encouraged us to have a Merry Christmas. All this happened on January 13. Maybe they are just SUPER prepared for next year?Bedrock is not cheap. To justify the prices they charge, the food needs to be excellent, the decor spotless, and the customer service needs to be exemplary. Through a series of wholly avoidable failures to pay even basic attention to proper customer service, Bedrock shamed themselves and turned us off rather thoroughly. If ANY of my employees demonstrated this REPEATED disinterest in (bordering on contempt for) ANY of my customers, there would be serious counseling in that employee's future. We hope you have better luck and more tolerance for gross ineptitude. If the customer service is THIS bad, what is the food possibly like? Frankly, I doubt we will be finding out..

Prompt and friendly service. Warm fluffy naan with roasted garlic bulb. Bone marrow was a sizeable portion (!) and had a good balance of flavours (herbs n diced onion on top) to keep it from being too rich, and the bread at the side gave enough crunch for texture. The steaks were done nicely according to our preference, evenly pink throughout with abit of char on the outside. A lovely experience from start to end. Worth a trip for special occasions! :
3
We had drinks and appetizers here one evening.We found the service very rushed, from being asked to order without menus, to plates being taken from the table without us having out our knives and forks down !However despite that the food was good and the drink selection was reasonable albeit a little pricey.I wouldn't purposely head back here but if I were passing and wanted food and drinks then it isn't a bad choice
4
Fancied a good steak and wasn't disappointed here. Excellent taste, well cooked and well presented. Good restaurant and not pretentious like you get with some fancy dining places. Good solid food in a well presented and simple.place. Staff are.helpful too. However, its pricey, so not an every week type of.place. As an o occasional place to eat, it was very enjoyable.
5
Been there today with a friend and we had the bedrock pepper steak. It was properly cooked and still tender. We also had the very nice mac and cheese on side.We had to wait a little for our main, but we didn't even noticed it. At the end of the service, they offer us two desserts and the two bottles of sparkling water that we ordered, just because they consider that they made us waiting. Wonderful service!Thanks, I will come back

For some reason it took me a long time to get around to visiting Bedrock, in part due to their annoying policy on Fri/Sat where you need to accommodate their 6.30pm or 8.30pm slots rather than being able to select your preferred time.The steaks themselves were decent, we had both dry aged and standard USDA rib eye together with fillet steak. Cooked as requested with decent char they were as they should be when paying $90-100 for a steak with nothing else. What wasn't acceptable was creamed spinach being sold out by 8.30pm (seriously?) or the offered asparagus alternative being very gritty and clearly not washed. Basics like this reflect very poorly on the calibre of the kitchen.Where this restaurant really falls short is the service. It was simply poor, lacking confidence and clueless, a common and unfortunate reality of the Singapore restaurant scene. I can live with weak service at a casual eatery but not when paying close to $1,000 for the meal. I get that US steak and Somerset rent costs are high, however the service bar is expectedly higher at this price point. There are restaurants that do it well, Bedrock is not one of them. Compared to Cut or Lukes this was amateur hour.An expensive experience that doesn't warrant repeating

I visited this restaurant with two business colleagues. The restaurant is very pricy, even for Singapore! A 200g steak will set you back $90! We had burgers and the flat brick chicken.The food was very tasty. Unfortunately the service was slow and a little disinterested. Not sure I would go to this restaurant again and yet so convenient close to the Jen hotel!Pit

food was underwhelming. Steak was overcooked and the churros was undercooked. porterhouse pork and the brick-pressed chicken were much better than the steak. service by waiting staff were quite good though. food is relatively expensive - expect to pay more than $120 per pax for starter and a main course with drinks
4
Went there twice and both had a fantastic time. I love the deco of this place nice and cosy. Food here is great and also try the cocktails. We had a few different ones and they were really good. Service excellent.

Visited Bedrock Bar & Grill for dinner - tried to make a reservation during the day but was informed that it was fully booked. However when we came back later in the evening we were able to get a table, also it was far from being fully booked.Mac & cheese is a must try - delicious starter to share! we had the US Grain Fed Ribeye (400g for SGD96), could barely finish the delicious steak.Service was nice & quick, will be happy to come by again
5
Great place to have happy hour and meal. The informal bar and alfresco area allows you to be casual and yet have a great meal. Bar bites are great wagyu burgers and truffle fries. The bar is also well stocked with whiskey wine or beer. Cocktails are great!

Have heard wonderful things about Bedrock's food so I came here with my partner for my birthday. Service was wonderful and the waitstaff were attentive to every table, checking with us if everything was ok. The food was really good too; we both had steaks, as as well the highly raved mac and cheese. Before we were about to leave, the waitstaff realised it was my birthday (from the date on the feedback form i filled in) and told us not to leave first and that she was arranging for a dessert. They served a cake with a candle on it and offered to help us take a photo as well! I was so impressed and surprised. Really great service and made my birthday a wonderful, memorable experience

we love our steak dinners. and the chains like Morton's, Ruth's Chris and the celebs like Wolfgang Puck's Cut cater well to different but usually deep pockets, special events etc. it was great to step into Bedrock for the first time to find a double dry aged porterhouse (USDA prime) that really tasted nicely beefy, and buttery, and tender on both sides of bone - too often, Aging is an excuse for charging higher prices for same old steak. Wife, Daughter and I shared this with a sides of truffle fries, eggy cream spinach, and steamed asparagus. it was simple and so delicious. surprisingly refreshing for jaded foodies. we stumbled on this for Saturday lunch and decided to just order a glass of Chilean. wine was also reasonable and a mouthful of fruity elegance, just short of jam . sorry can't remember the name but I'm sure the friendly staff will help. will go back again soon. and compared to competitors , reasonably priced. ambience is a little same old dark clubby wooden place like most high end steak restaurants.
2
This place is in the wrong location.For steak the prices are as high as The Cut but the quality is nowhere near as good.The set lunch is affordable but everything else is not.At 89 sing dollars for a very average tenderloin they should at least have their own washroom.Bought in fries were clearly mass produced frozen and servd in ridiculous quantity.In summary this is not somewhere to visit on any level.Hugely bad value and a terrible location.Avoid

Spent our short evening over here as I was craving for some good Mac & Cheese. Googled days before for some recommended place and this was short listed based on reviews and location.Ordered soup, main and side dishes for the 3 of us. We chosen an outdoor seats as we know that we will be quite noisy, talking and laughing.Service was good from the staff that took our orders as we asked for some recommendation being the first time patrons here. Explaining some condiments that we are not well verse in as well. FoodMac & Cheese is slurp and instagramableCalamari sauce was tasty, well mixedTuna was not too badOverall, I would say its a good place to spend for beer, wine, food and not forgetting some good company.Cheers,Jazly

A relatively basic meal cost me over 200 with a couple of beers. However I did have more food than I could eat, and the service is excellent. Inside is a bit dark but I was happy for the AC as I'd been running around all afternoon. The bread came with a full head of roasted garlic and was a small meal in itself. I asked for a baked camembert starter and got a full small wheel of camembert with what seemed to be a cheese sauce which was very filling, and the US dry aged ribeye was very large (although I chose one of the smallest on the menu) and I mistakenly ordered fries as well which turned out to be an enormous basked of (very very good) truffle fries. The meal was great but I'll exhibit a bit more portion control next time. On the whole it was a good night out
5
Bedrock bar and grill is coveninently located in busy Orchard Rd, just a walk from Somerset MRT. Whilst outdoor dining is available, dining inside offered a cool and quiet respite from the busy pedestrian traffic. The steak range was varied and though a bit pricey, it was tender and juicy....griÄºled to your liking. The scallop entree was lovely. The wine range was great though the Hendricks gin was a tad pricey. Service was polite and professional, and prompt only because people were waiting for the table for the 8.30 pm seating. Likely to return again

This steakhouse was highly recommended. The grilled bone marrow was outstanding as well as the creamy spinach, until the main course... the grain fed medium rare australian striploin steak was tough and somewhat tasteless. Don't order it unless you like your 80$ steak chewy. The waitress came to ask me if I wanted to order something else, but if I don't like my food I usually feel full very fast. They deducted a drink off my bill, and gave me a coupon for a future lunch. I would give it a second chance, but stay away from the striploin
3
Read reviews that food was good here. Ordered the Irish tenderloin & US ribeye. Med rare. Meat was not as good as expected. Quite a fair bit of the "veins" and meat was alittle tough.
5
we visit Bedrock regularly and always have a good meal here. The steaks and sides are consistently good. I think they could have a slightly better wine list though as typically quite expensive so corkage is another option considering.
5
I brought my top agent to thank her for cobroking 3 units with me. Heard a lot about Bedrock but hadn't had a chance to pop by. Saw online they have a set lunch at $58++ and I'm intrigued. I had the lobster bisque, woodfire grilled ribeye steak and sticky stout and toffee pudding. Oh my goodness, I am blown away. Delicious is an understatement. I am impressed and so was my cobroke. Thank you Bedrock Bar and Grill. U deserve to be in the top 10 steakhouse in Singapore. P.S> sorry for the blurry pictures
5
Hungry for meat, we attached the Bedrock and were not disappointed, and in fact were very pleased. The pork porterhouse steak was one of the best I have had anywhere, with wonderful taste, tender meat, and cooked just right. The yellowtail tuna was also very well cooked, with black olive and caviar aubergine sauce that added to the flavour. The wine was just right for the meal and we left totally satisfied. Excellent service, with a smile, and they were able to seat us without a reservation (luckily we arrived early)
5
The steaks here are great, and really what you should come for. Yes, it's pricey, and the steak dishes come with no sides, whereas if you order the non-steak main course (cheaper price), it does come with fries. But I guess it's the way Bedrock shows, with good reason, their confidence with quality beef, properly cooked and with minimum seasoning.The venue is not that big, and was very packed on the night we visited (we came on a Saturday). They have the two-seatings rule, and as we booked the earlier seating (between 6-7 pm), we had to leave by 8.30 pm. There was just enough time for us to relaxedly go through the meal, but we didn't have dessert as we were too full anyway. Service was very good, although the waiter seemed overwhelmed at times with the other guests. Another thing Bedrock is known for is their whiskey collection, and a whiskey tasting nicely caps my dinner here

Not super impressed with Bedrock Bar and Grill. Steaks are decent but not supreme quality like what you get at Morton's or Fat Cow. My dining partner and I ordered 2 of the most expensive wood-fired steaks on the menu, "Irish Dry Aged Grass-Fed Beef". We chose ribeye and striploin to compare. Though the prices were similar at $98++ for a 300g steak, the ribeye turned out to be more tender than the striploin (not surprising though). We had the steaks done medium-rare. Although they were well-executed technically -- except for the burned sides which were tough and not pleasant to bite into and the lack of accompanying sides (you need to pay $14-$18 extra for sides of salad / vege or potatoes -- a rip off!!!) -- the steaks were nothing to shout about. Presentation wise, you get a black iron-plate and a side of sauce on a separate white bowl. Does it sound boring just reading that? That's exactly how I felt. No attempt to garnish, no attempt to excite the eyes. Here you go, eat your steak, you meat-eater! It was decent overall, the service was attentive though not friendly. However, there's no reason for a repeat visit after this.Best to buy the membership from The Entertainer to get a 1-for-1 deal for main course. Otherwise, I feel that food is overpriced. Alternatively, go for the set lunch menu for better value-for-money.For those who car, you get 1 free hour of parking. Somerset MRT station is right downstairs

Nice place for dinner & wine, a tad too expensive as steak come without any sides dishes, side orders are additional charges. We love the Mac & Cheese. Get the Entertainer App and you can shave half the price off as it entitles you to 1 for 1 main course, worth the visit.Overall, good meal and service for us

Thinking this place might be in the same league as CUT @ MBS or Morton's, I called to ask if shorts for men would be acceptable; they said "it's OK sir, but long trousers are encouraged"; there were several men in shorts and flip-flops, including one with a singlet! The best part of the food was the bone marrow appetizer - very yummy! Although we had ordered all our steaks medium-rare, the porterhouse came out AT LEAST medium, if not slightly well done. By the time a new piece was produced, most of the sides had been consumed, along with the other steaks. Overall, the food is OK, but there are at least half a dozen restaurants in Singapore where the steaks would be definitely better. Service is friendly, but not high class. They try hard (spread of whole garlic in olive oil served with the pita bread, lots of whiskies, etc), but at this price level, you usually get more... Oh, we also made the mistake of following their advice and parked at Pan-Pacific Service Suites instead of Somerset 313 - for the duration of the meal, the fee was SGD 13

food was good, albeit pricey - we had the jamon, oysters and steak, one glass of wine. would have cost us abt $380 for 2 pax if not for the Entertainer discount. okay for a top class steakhouse, but not sure if this place really counts. at the end of the day, it really boiled down to the service. i called to make a reservation the day before. they have 2 seatings at 6pm and at 830pm. i asked for the 830pm but given it was a weekday night, i asked if it was possible to call on the day itself to check if i could come earlier. was informed it would be a full house. i said okay, and made the reservation. when i called back about 5min later to change the reservation to 6pm, they strangely couldn't find my reservation. so i had to make it again. subsequently, they called me once again, and sent me another text, to remind me that of the turnover and that i had to give up my table at 830pm. and i had to respond to say okay otherwise they'd give up my table. of course, when we got to the restaurant, it was pretty much empty until around 730pm. and when we were done at 830pm, there were still empty tables - so we really needn't have been rushed to finish dinner. i mean, i can understand they want to serve as many customers as they can, but at the expense of the dining experience? also, we ordered the foie gras to top the steak but it came without. when we asked, the waitress just said "oh, i'll check" and then came back with it on a separate plate. no apologies, no explanations offered. like as if it was just something to be expected. atmosphere was otherwise excellent.

Great beef and super sides - creamed spinach, truffle fries, sautÃ©ed mushrooms, rocket salad and, my favourite, the amazing Mac and cheese! The Tomahawk steak is a large 1.8kg leg for sharing with 5 sauces. Black Pepper steak is their signature dish. Desserts are mean too - Apple crumble with large Apple pieces and a generous scoop of ice cream and the waffle ice cream delicious! The servings are very generous so order with caution. Service is attentive and effective.
5
I was there for my birthday celebration with my boyfriend and the service was prompt and the service staffs on the floor were very attentive.The food there was superb too. We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner there :)
3
We were there as a group of 6 and tried different cuts of beef. We all felt the steaks were not juicy enough. Sides were good we had sweet potatoes with blue cheese and Mac n cheese. Nice ambience and good service overall.
5
I m super impressed with the nann served, it was great to go with the roasted tomato soup. The steak n truffle fries were great and overall simply Awesome!
5
steak was great, the staffs were helpful in explaining the cuts, service was wonderful. They surprised us with a little chocolate cake for our wedding & birthday celebration at the end of the dinner :)
5
Quality meat cook just the way you wanted, juicy and succulent.
Mac and cheese here is divine, very addictive!
Cosy place with sufficient waiters
5
My partner and i visited the restaurant on Sunday night and we have a lovely dinner at Bedrock. The service staff were friendly and efficient, very professional as well. We ordered a soup to share, 2 steaks (we love the wagyu steak but not the ribeye), mac and cheese and also cream spinach. The portions were huge and we couldn't quite finish our meal. There was a 1 for 1 promotion for the beer during happy hour too. It was value for money as we utilized the Entertainer App and claimed for 1 free main course, which was worth over 80 dollars. The bill came up to about $200 when it could be $300. Overall, it is worth visiting especially if you have the Entertainer App. Do consider making reservations
5
went yesterday after a memorable first trip - mac n cheese and the classic bedrock steak were a constant lovely memory after the first! Tried the baked camembert cheese and the french onion soup together with the "two staples" and boy were we gloriously happily stuffed! Probably went a bit too heavy on the cheese, through my own choices but with such lovely food and service, I'll be back for a third time

Most people walk by the Bedrock Bar & Grill without considering it, and few realize that it is related to Oriole's just next door. Tucked into the thoroughfare between 313@Somerset and the Pan Pacific Service Suites, there is no lack of human traffic outside. However, once you are escorted into the restaurant, you are taken far from the maddening crowd into a world of its own.The restaurant has blinds that carefully shields the interior from prying eyes, offering a private and intimate dining affair. The Aussie-inspired menu is great, with the 3-course lunch an absolute steal! It is $58+++ for a steak main-course, and $38+++ for the non-steak ones.I had the cured salmon to start, followed by the rib-eye steak, ending with the stout and toffee pudding. My dining partner had the lobster bisque to start, the pressed boneless chicken, ending with the almond financiers. We shared a bottle of wine (their wine list is quite extensive).Food was good, and service was prompt and attentive, but not intrusive. The subdued lighting inside makes it good for a date, or a intimate catch-up with friends.Would definitely come back for the lunch, and even try it for dinner, though there is no set menu for dinner

Discreetly tucked somewhere in the Pan Pacific Serviced Suites Orchard and 313 Somerset, Bedrock is a dream for carnivores.I was there with 2 of my mates. Between the 3 of us, we ordered the Australian Grass-fed Ribeye, and the USDA Prime Tenderloin and Ribeye. We wanted our meat Medium-Rare, and this is one of the few places that certainly know that means. The outside was pleasantly charred for a smokey texture and flavour. The immediate inside of the meat was dry and my first reaction was that it was overcooked to Medium. But as I carved more of the meat and moved inwards, the meat was a beautiful shade of pink with no 'blood' (Or, to the purists, myoglobin) oozing out. It was tender, still slightly warm, and bursting with natural flavours. Paired with a bottle of Malbec that the sommelier recommended, we went to heaven and back.There is an extensive list of whiskys and selected desserts available as well. But we were pretty content with our conquests. Burp

Visited Bedrock Bar and Grill with a few of my business partners over one weekday lunch. Their lunch sets are very affordable at $50+++ for their signature steak mains which comes with a starter and dessert. Other seafood or pasta mains as part of the lunch set cost around $38+++ which offers fantastic value as well. The service is attentive with experienced staff ready to make recommendations. The restaurant is beautifully decorated, trendy and upmarket, most suitable for business lunches or friends gathering. For couples, you will find that it has a romantic feel in the ambient, great for steak and wine dinners.

A group of us (party of 3) went to Bedrock for dinner yesterday. At the time of booking and ordering, we had told the receptionist and the server, respectively, that we plan to use the entertainer app promotion (complimentary main course when a main course of equal or greater value is purchased). We ordered a salad ($22), porterhouse ($89), whole rack of lamb ($129) and a bottle of wine ($180). When the bill came, the restaurant tried to wriggle its way out of honoring the complimentary main course promotion, claiming that the rack of lamb we ordered is NOT considered as a MAIN COURSE because it's classified as "For the Table". We were appalled by the restaurant's lame attempt to dis-honor the promotion. If the rack of lamb is genuinely to be excluded from the promotion, it should have been explicitly communicated to us during ordering or written clearly in the entertainer app promotion rules & regulation. In any case, the restaurant would have ended up making less revenue ($40 less) had we ordered another steak instead of lamb. The fact that we spent another $180 on wine is above and beyond the minimum spend goes to show we were willing spenders.In the end, the manager agreed to take the cost of the porterhouse steak as a "gesture of goodwill". "Gesture of goodwill" again, is a gross misrepresentation of the situation, implying that we were being unreasonable and extorting something from the restaurant when it was clearly the restaurant trying to renege on their promotion, despite running a ~$400 dinner tab. In the end we paid ~$125 per person. For that amount, one is better off going to Luke's across the street where the steak execution is clearly a class above Bedrock and avoid going through unpleasant (and unnecessary) argument to finish off the evening

Good steaks at average price. Weekend lunch menu is a bargain. Problems always come with the service. Specially reservations and seating.There are same kind of places around Singapore with same food and better client experience
4
This restaurant is actually on the outside of 313 Somerset and NOT inside Pan Pac Hotel. Upon entering the restaurant, we were greeted by all the serving staff... Yes ALL! We got a lovely corner round seat and enjoyed our "privacy". The restaurant is rather small and tables were quite tightly packed. The soup, steak, side dishes and drinks were all good. However, the Black Forest Cake was not what we expected. We did noticed the "flourless" word on the menu. The cake was more like a chocolate mousse than a cake. It would be nice if the server staff introduce themselves to us. At the end of the meal, they requested for us to complete a feedback form. There was a question on staff but we did not know any of their names.
5
Enjoyed a nice porterhouse steak dinner there with wine, and the restaurant was nice enough to help me wrap the remaining bone with which I made a delicious broth. With thanks to Sebastian for his warm and informative service
5
The way they serve the food great. Lovely presentation and delicious food. Would love to go there again if i get a chance
4
Great setting and ambience. Works equally well for couples, friends or a business meal (private dinning rooms also available). The Meat : the sourcing of the produce is unquestionable, steaks are succulent and flavourful even if your choose to have them cooked on the medium-well to well end of the scale. The sauces do not over power the meat - which is always a plus at the meat is the star of the show - BUT it should be given that prices for steaks start at $80++ (for a 10oz/300g ribeye). Also one of the best burgers I've had in town a real belt buster but then at $38++ it HAD better be!Staff/Service : The staff are reasonably well informed (by Singapore standards) and generally unintrusive but there's nothing of note or stand-out that warrants special mention
5
I brought my girlfriend to Bedrock on a nice Sunday evening for her birthday, and we must say the staff here who served us (Ms Julie (especially), Mr Pugan, Mr Dilen, Ms Imee and Ms Chloe), were really so attentive, very friendly and gave us a really enjoyable time.If you want to enjoy good excellent service, this is certainly the place to come to!Their service is first-class in short!Mr Le
4
Had their lunch set - lobster bisque, wagyu steak and chocolate tarte. Classic bisque was delicious, wagyu steak grilled in the woodfire oven was tasty, and their rustic fries were amazing. Dessert was a little underwhelming.Went there for a birthday celebration and the servers sang us a birthday song while serving the dessert to us. Cute! Would come back again for the service and food

This is submitted to explain why I will never go to this restaurant again. I am a business traveler when in Singapore. I go there several times a year. On a trip I went into Bedrock, had a nice steak dinner and good wine. Went back the same trip for a burger and flight of whiskey. I like the atmosphere and the food and beverages. So on my last trip I was traveling with my wife. After orchard shopping I drug her down to have a burger at bedrock. She enjoys the fashion scene and likes to people watch so she asked for a table next to the walkway. The server asked us if we are eating. We said yes. She told us that we couldn't sit at the outer tables. They are reserved for drinking only unless all other tables are full. Seriously? So, we left and ate next door. During the course of our entire meal, nobody occupied the table we were denied at bedrock. So, yeah, this was a disrespectful decision on part of staff which is undoubtedly driven by management and I have no interest in patronizing such an establishment
3
I was there for drinks only.Location - Nearest somerset stationService- The female service staff was okay.I am wondering about the closing timing stated on tripadvisor though. If I remember accurately, I left about 11 and I was one of the last few. Last order was about 10pm and they want the customers to leave by about 11pm
5
Great ambiance though the place is a bit too dark! The apple crumble is the perfect dessert to end the meal!
5
Went there for a birthday dinner, promptly served by friendly staff. Good wine recommendations. Apart from the stars of the menu such as steak, the mac and cheese, and mashed potato were the highlights. Pretty cosy for quiet dinners and catch up.
4
i've been to bedrock a few times in the past but the last time was super sweet because i got an awesome 2-for-1 deal. but i can say that it had been consistent in delivering perfectly cooked steak. it has a romantic ambience (i.e. a bit dark and cozy) so it's definitely perfect for a date night
5
Came here awhile ago with my wife for our anniversarythe place smell like a good meal from the startthey gave us a nice booth seatwe had the Bedrock pepper steak which us a man size piece of meat alreadybut i would suggest you guys try the other sauces instead of the standard peppercorn sauce which was ok but others were more interestingi like the wholegrain whiskey mustardand now the Mac n Cheese was out of the worldGotta tryPotion size is not huge cos i think if u eat too much of it u will be in cheese heavenRICH and TASTYI think even jus having the Mac n Cheese i am good hahaOverall a great mea
3
us ribeye steak surprisingly tough. Just slightly below expectations. Mac and cheese was very nice. Service very good. Ambience also good.
4
We stumbled upon this place walking through busy orchard looking for a place for dinner.. And yeas this was the 1st of Jan 2016! But I must say service was very nice and warm and was a good start to a new year!!We ordered the bedrock pepper steak, tomatoe soup and rocket salad! The soup and salad was very good and large portions too! The steak was well cooked .. But let's say not out of this world..Having said that they had a nice happy hour offer on wine ., one for one.. And the atmosphere was nice and chilled out!Overall a nice relaxing evening !

Bedrock is an American style steakhouse just off Orchard Rd. The decor features heavy white linens and dark wood fittings, and a low level lighting ambiance suitable for late night red wine quoffing over a big piece of aged steak into the early hours. So my lunchtime visit for the set menu for a business lunch, no wine, was not Bedrock in its prime time. There was a choice of three starters - the lobster bisque and the smoked salmon were good, but the salmon portion was a little little. The mains were more generous but the barramundi fillet was not especially tasty, with a sprinking of tiny slices of asparagus. The chicken breast came with a fried egg and looked much larger and richer.Dessert was a very dry eclair with a couple of berries, which disappointed - choux pastry which is dry is no fun, and the white chocolate icing was also lacking texture or moisture. I left the restaurant still hungry and wished that maybe I had gone a la carte for something more substantial or had eaten more bread.Service was good - efficient, smart and friendly. Prices were to my mind high, but 313 Orchard is a prime location and the upmarket atmosphere of Bedrock probably commands a premium
2
Had dry aged steak costing $96 for 300g. It's a good size steak but served with nothing except sauce. Everything else is ala carte, there no garnish or veg on the plate. Flavor is good but steak is not cut evenly, resulting in one side being overcooked from medium doneness. When I complained to the pinoy waiter, he rebuked to say that doneness is checked from the centre of the steak. I'm quite shocked that he is trying to say I don't know my steak! He did offer to have it replaced but I think his service is bad and refused. Ordered scallop with jamon iberico at $32 for 2 pieces. It's just USA frozen scallops. Nothing to shout about really. The size of scallop is about the size of ping pong ball. Pathetically small for $32. Wine are overpriced too at above $200 per bottle.The only thing that's worth a praise is the 10% offer when I showed the ieatishootipost website screenshot which was expired but they gave discount anyway.
4
Bedrock Bar and Grill is an excellent stakehouse located at the heart of Singapore shopping and business district. A bit pricey but it's worth it if you plan to indulge yourself with very good stake, pretty good selection of wine and liquor (we got single malt) and pretty efficient and friendly service. I would recommend it to my colleagues and friends visiting Singapore in the future
3
this place is all about the meat, the range is fantastic, wine choices cool although they regularly have offers in the bar which are not bizarrely replicated in the restaurant...service was ok and the atmsphere ok without being amazing...great for meat but there are better places in Singapore for that
4
I finally ate here a few weeks back when after passing by it some many times. All i have to says is go hungry with friends and order the Tomahawk steak. That was amazing. yumm!
4
Went for lunch and had 3 course lunch. Picked char-grilled baby gem as starter, steak burger as main, and warm chocolate pudding as dessert. Good quality, good decor and good service. Surely one of the choice when you want to go for meat near Orchard.
4
Pricey starters. I had a fairly basic tomato salad and it was underwhelming. Ribeye was good but a little dry and for the money (98 Singapore Dollars) not good value. I have had better for less. Nice but expensive wines. A colleague paid so don't know final bill)One very weird aspect is that they have no toilets - you have to use those of a neighbouring cafe (linked to them apparently
3
Service is in general quite good, even though slips on Fri night due to crowd.They require to complete first wave in 2 hours on Fri that does not help for comfortable and relaxed dinner.They have been kind enough to show us steak cuts before cooking.However when cooked taste was quite average.Overall this is very nice place with comfortable seating, but not real value for moneyEnded up not having dessert there
5
We called at this restaurant because French Onion soup was on the menu. We mistakenly thought that steak Diane was what it purported to be but it was a giant mushroom with a Diane-like sauce. My wife said it was okay. The French Onion was one of the best I have had, followed by superb beef ribs in bbq sauce: excellent. The waiter, Paul, could not have been more friendly and helpful; the ambience was good too. The only drawback was the price of everything: not for the,faint-hearted
4
What a great place for business lunch. Wonderful set menus with several choices of starters, mains and deserts. I had salmon to start with and chicken as my main. Happy with my meal and my friend was satisfied with his salad and grilled fish. Prices were decent and atmosphere is good. Will return.
4
One of the few restaurants in Singapore that offer their set lunch over the weekend. Reasonably priced at $38 (seafood & poultry) or $58 (steaks) for a three course meal. Liked the house cured salmon but really enjoyed the generous 300g striploin that was juicy and flavorsome. Almost as good as the steak at CUT but better than what I had at Mortons and far better than Bread Street Kitchen (Singapore)Will be back agai
5
We have been here for a number of occasions and in particular to celebrate our son's 21st in the private dining area!!! Absolutely love this place for great food (steaks are superb) at good value, but the service has always been amazing!! Thank you for always making our evenings there so special!

Had the tomato soup, tenderloin , US ribeye and truffle mash.Tomato soup- 3/10 literally taste like burnt BBQ sauce. $16 is definitely not worth it. Better of taking the money to have a beer as your starterTenderloin. Tasted good for medium well. 7/10US Ribeye: if you are keen on a mouth exercise and planning to have a sleepless night blowing $96 for a steak , go for it! Surely one of the nomination for the worst steak of the year. ( unrated ) as meat was tough and hardly marbledTruffle mash: Honestly, KFC mash wins it hands down. Expensive and not worth the money. There wasn't any texture to the potato and the truffle used must have been diluted. Smell was faint , taste was barely trufflesteak. Can consider if you are willing to splash the
5
Cane here recently for a business lunch and was blown away by the quality if the service, wine and food. The steak was excellent, as was the onion soup. Don't be put off by the fact it's in a shopping mall - some of the best restaurants in Singapore are! Very much recommended, but note it's not a cheap venue

This restaurant now become my regular dinner place after tonight dinner. Nice staff with great steak and kid also can eat here.

The restaurant is in a shopping centre and though the service was excellent, the whole thing seems to be set up to extract an unreasonable amount of cash out of you. I have eaten in plenty of restaurants that charge this much for food but they offer real innovation and skill. And you don't have to leave the restaurant to get to the bathrooms. $100 steak was average and under size, though properly cooked. The rest of the dishes on offer had no innovation at all. So what was the high price for? No idea. If you want to shell out this much for dinner, go somewhere with an artist in the kitchen. If this place halved its prices it would be about the right level

Visited bedrock twice. The first time was in June, the service and food were great. So we went back last week for the second time but was totally disappointed with the steaks. The steaks tasted buttery and didn't prepare according to our orders. We made a note to the staff of the food quality and they apologized. The management needs to control the food quality and the consistency. However the staff are friendly

I am somewhat reluctant to write about Bedrock . It 's a little gem in the heart of Orchard Road that is not crowded yet and serves good steak in a a cosy environment . I've had dinner here some time ago and returned for lunch recently. The menu is like that of Morton's.. Good steaks with a variety of side dishes. Lunch set was good value . Dinner costs more 
4
Shared a 1.6kg tomahawk steak with my 2 cousins and it was delicious! The Mac and cheese is also highly recommended. Had a great bottle of win as well and it wasn't cheap, entire meal and drinks ran over 800. Would recommend if you don't mindaying for it
2
I expect quite a lot from a steak when it come out at $100, and I'm afraid to say that Bedrock doesn't get there. We had the 300g rib-eyes (average), with pepper sauce horrible), duck fat fried potatoes (tasted like they were pre-frozen) and grilled cos (good), bottle of Chiraz....all in $400 for 2. Overall a disappointing dinner, there are much better options in Singapore at this price range
4
We had lunch there, with no reservation.The service is good, and they offer a choice of set menus or a la carte dishes.We had a set menu for 58S$, reasonnable indeed:A good (tasty and well sized) salad first, then a very good wagyu beef with onions and spuds, and fianlly as a sweet, a chocolate and cherry torte that was ok , good! The ambiance of the restaurant is warm, not too formal, and one good thing, there is not much music, so it is great for business as well.A good address
4
Setting was very cozy due dimmed lighting in American concept but dining area small for privacy. Ordered tenderloin, Australian Ribeye alongside Caesar Salad and popular Mac & Cheese. Overall food served were decent but not magnificent. Like the roasted after taste but done-ness skills could be improved. Wanted medium but came medium rare. Mac & Cheese was certainly perfect and must be ordered!Service was excellent as all if not most servers were ever ready to assist and genuine. Great job indeed.Total damage around $200 including 2 glasses of red wine but used complimentary Entertainer App

Only good thing about this restaurant was the bread and butter.Food was bad, straight up. I had a cheeseburger and my friend has a steak, neither of us finished our meals. The jamon is decent, but nothing too crazy. Skip the bone marrow, doesn't taste like much.Very over priced for what you're getting. Stay away
3
Service is very slow and waiting time was long. Given that steak takes time, but there weren't many tables and yet it took too long.With that being said, steak was alright. Mac n' cheese was pretty good too in my opinion.The reason why I won't go back though is mainly because of the waiting time, price is quite steep and tables are quite close to one another (Personally don't like people eavesdropping on my conversations).
5
the steak was great and foie gras amazing! i enjoyed my wine (had 2 bottles) the atmosphere was just nice and food so delicious! the place is a bit crowded but its all good, we stayed inside..good place for date night.
5
This is probably one of the best restaurants for beef in Asia! Well-seasoned and perfectly cooked. And their Mac&Cheese are to-die-for.
4
Plenty of choices of steak, nice decoration.
Food 4/5
Service/staff 5/5
Try tenderloin steak, its perfect especially with variety of sauce....i like chili sauce.
4
Went for dinner and had one of the best steak in Singapore. I order onion soup for starter and was very taste and I love the hint of spice on it. My main order I got the tenderloin which was incredible amazing, for dish side I order Mac and cheese (You MUST try it) it's so yummy.The only negative is the service, very slow. We arrived and take almost 15 min to someone come with the menu or even order drink.
5
Love coming back to this place. The service is good and friendly. Highly recommend the Braised Beef Rib and Mac n Cheese. The portion of beef ribs is Massive. They have a few nice Gins other than the standard boring gins you normally see. Recommend the "Old Raj" Gin & Tonic. Sadly the booth tables are ridiculously tight and too close to the seat there is hardly any room to feel comfortable. 1 slightly annoying thing is that you will be asked "how is your food" by every waiter and waitress all night, kind of annoying to have to validate it over and over even though they mean well. Guys, try this one, Only the person who took the food order may ask how the food is. the other servers have to find something else to chat about with customers and if you think about it you shouldn't even have to ask you should be able to look at a table and see if they enjoying eating the food. If they are not eating it - time to step in and ask. I will continue to go back to Bedrock and enjoy the good many things about the place
5
This was our second trip to Bedrock and we left as happy & satisfied at the first!We popped in for a burger and it was one of the best burgers we have collectively ever eaten! Cooked (medium) to perfection & served with a smile.I would highly recommend the burger option but too the steak! Best non wagyu steak that I have eaten in Singapore. Also their Mac&cheese is seriously life changing.Ask for a booth is you are booking in advance as it makes the experience that much more special!We shall be back soon

Had dinner at Bedrock two nights back. This is a find dine restaurant in 313@Somerset. We ordered the Barramundi and the Beef Burger. We were served a warm pita bread with butter and sauteed garlic pod, a nice touch. I ordered a fine whiskey and was very pleased to see my whisky served in a Glencairn glass (the official single malt whisky glass). The dinner was excellent, the Barramundi was cooked just right & the beef burger was succulent. We skipped the dessert as by then we were full. Highly recommended :
2
Booked for 10pax dining for a friend birthday but nothing was done on restaurant. Point 2 ~ Steak wasn't amazing as reviewed - disappointed on the price paid. We felt overpriced - Won't recommend. Service team could be attention to details that will be plus point
2
The place is quite crowded, in a prime position as it's right at the entrance of 311@somerset shopping mall. Very nice interiors, menu looks very refined and classy. Waiters service is very good, shame for the food that we found expensive and quite normal compared to the price we paid. Portions were not very generous, while prices were quite high

To the Bedrock Team, We were there last week celebrating the graduation of my eldest brother. To be honest, after reading several not so good reviews on Bedrock, I was a little unsure on whether to bring my family to try out your place on such a special occasion but my bf insisted that I should give it a try and was raving about the mac n cheese at your place. So, we came. The hostess gave us a very warm welcome upon our arrival and we were seated in one of the couches in the restaurant. Bro was so excited to see that there were wagyu steaks featured in the menus and insisted we ordered them. The manager was very patient in explaining the different cuts of the wagyu and the other beef cuts in the menu to us and she also recommended us to order a double cut which was more value for money. Thumbs up so far! Our waiter who took our orders was very helpful as well and advised us on sharing three sides instead of four as it might be too much. As expected, the wagyu was just plain perfect! And the mac n cheese, it was simply deliciously mouth watering! Our waitress offered us to share the signature Apple Crumble but we were too stuffed and asked for the bill right after our meal. Much to our regret, the Apple Crumble looks so good (the table next to us ordered it) but we will be back for sure for it! Overall, we all had a great time and I am glad we decided on Bedrock as it has made our dinner experience a wonderful one!Keep it up, Bedrock! We will be back

Interestingly I ordered a simple beer and it took more than 30 minutes. Then I ordered some fries it never came. Never coming back.
3
Ridiculously overpriced steak house, $96 for a rib eye that had to be returned as tough and inedible. Service very average and slow. I wont be back thats for sure, too many steakhouses in Singapore with better quality meat and service for way leass dollar.
5
My wife and some friends wandered into bedrock for dinner. the food was excellent. wonderful steak. I was especially impressed by Henry who was terrific and made the evening flow so well.
I would love to go back for great food.
Excellent Job...Thanks

Good service good food and lovely ambience. The place was not cheap but for the location, the quality of food and the quantity of food it was worth every cent.
3
I went here for a business lunch. I had reserved the table online but the system is not automated, so it took more than 24 hours to get a response. My initial impression was that it looked slightly tired and lacked energy, although it was less than quarter full when I visited.The menu looked fairly standard for a grill. We went for the set lunch menu. I chose the cured salmon to start, which was pretty ordinary and followed it with the grilled veal chop. The meat was fairly good and cooked as I had requested, but it didn't seem special.Service was at a minimum standard they executed the basics but nothing more.Overall I thought it was very ordinary and would be unlikely to return
5
I went there with my wife to celebrate Xmas day, ordered a couple of drinks which tasted really great. When we saw the steak, we can't hold back anymore, it was really fantastic. One of the most delicious piece of meat which I have ever had in my life. The portion is rather generous as well, we were really full after the meal and we don't even have any more room for dessert.It might seem a bit expensive, but for this kind of quality I really don't mind spending my money. It is also located in the middle of the shopping area, so after your meal you could just take a walk and shop around, enjoy the atmosphere of Orchard road, and hang out somewhere around the area
4
We ordered applewood chicken, pepper steak and cream spinach during our last visit. The steak was nice and big with the inside still soft and juicy and cover w a very thin layer of fats that gives it a nice flavour. Don't really like the pepper sauce thou. But steak is nicer just eating plain. The chicken is good too.The mock tail and complementary flat bread and roasted garlic was great.The only disappointment was spinach isnt good at all feeling like spinach soaked in salty water

We are steak lovers, and were really looking forward to visiting Bedrock Bar and Grill on our to Singapore last weekend. I sent an email reservation request via the restaurant online form on Friday afternoon, requesting to book a table for Sunday evening. I immediately received an auto-response informing that I would receive a response shortly.As of Saturday evening, 24 hours later, I still hadn't heard back from them, so I telephoned when we arrived in Singapore. I was informed by a lady that "the restaurant responds to all reservation requests personally, within 24 hours, so I would most likely hear back within the next hour or two. But there are tables available." Didn't hear back from them that evening, or the following morning or afternoon. If they had tables available, as she stated, I am not quite sure why she couldn't have just confirmed my reservation while I was on the phone.I finally heard back from them early on Sunday evening, a couple of hours before my intended booking and a full 48 hours after the reservation request was submitted. Yes, my table was confirmed. By this point we were so fed up with Bedrock that we changed our plans and decided to eat at Morton's. Which, by the way, has impeccable service to go along with its outstanding food.When you make plans to go to a restaurant where you will probably be dropping about $400 per couple, you expect better customer service than this. Bedrock deserves to go bankrupt. Won't even think about trying to come here in the future.Highly NOT recommended

A steakhouse with a cozy atmosphere and located just next to 313 Somerset, Bedrock was the choice of our dinner venue to celebrate hubby's 30th birthday last Sunday. It was a last minute booking as the husband was craving more for steaks than my home cooked food (argh!). The hostess who took our reservation was so nice to sit us at a corner sofa seat, despite the heavy traffic of people dining in that night. A brief explanation on the menus and signature dishes were given to us by our server an we couldn't have been happier that we took his recommendations. You must try their signature Bedrock Smoked Tomato Soup - very different from normal tomato soups I have ever tried - the smoky hint to it was very unusual but good. We shared a plate of Jamon - cured Spanish ham and was said to be the top grade by our server. Tenderloin was my choice and the husband opted for a grain-fed Ribeye. The main highlight was their Mac and Cheese! It's heavenly, trust me. Never walk out of Bedrock without trying this dish! We were out of space for desserts and when we asked for the check, little did we know there was a surprise on the way. About three servers crowded around our table and brought a little dessert with a candle and was singing a birthday song! What a surprise! The husband was slightly embarrassed but what a nice touch for a special occasion! They will even volunteer to take a picture for us but we politely declined. On our way out, a lady in the bar also wished him happy birthday! We will be back for sure, definitely! Thank you to the Bedrock team for making his birthday a memorable one (:P/s The bill was slightly shocking but I guess sometimes we pay not only for the food but for the experience as well. A good place for planning a special occasion like a birthday or anniversary

A great shame that the overriding impression of our dining experience was that of being substandard despite the delicious tasting food.Impeccable service is assured at top notch restaurants but even your average run of the mill eateries adhere to basic service standards.Bedrock prides themselves as being above average in terms of restaurant rank but unfortunately there is a disjoint between its food and overall ambience/ service .A dining experience starts at the door and unfortunately every point of contact we had showcased disinterested , tired staff who lacked basic communication skills as well as initiative . The bespectacled Chinese waiter we had was the worst of the lot.We weren't the only table feeling it. We observed other diners requesting their table to cleaned after having just being seated,cold bread returned, request for menus etcThe Ribeye steak and Mac & cheese were absolutely delicious . Flavor of the beef came through nicely and the later was crispy on the top but oozed a delicious blend of cheeses.The tenderloin first came out burnt and the second attempt saw it being raw despite the request for a medium doneness.Food is delicious overall but this can be easily gotten at similarly priced steak houses ( with better service ).Unless one had a discount voucher , I would not recommend eating here .Parking at the Pan Pacific residences is not recommended either . Only a one hour complimentary ticket is provided as compared to a cheaper flat fee at surrounding garages
4
Had the tenderloin with the whisky mustard sauce, it's quite nice together. My biggest take away for the meal was actual the truffle potato side dish! It's super good.
5
Amazing steaks and wonderful side items (must order the mac-n-cheese!).
Service was normal for Singapore (could always be better).
4
Whenever I visit Singapore, I usually head to this place to meet my friends for a catch up. I enjoy the location as it is convenient and a great place to people watch. Their service is usually good and their happy hour is a bonus.
3
The service is not that efficient. It took us an hour to get our main course. But after tasting the food, its worth the wait. Would definitely recommend this restaurant.
4
Very nicely placed in Somerset station around other bars and restaurants , service atmosphere very good, food tasted very well we loved it, Grilled chicken was fantastic and I can say the same for the Burger , our daughter had massive waffles with ice-cream for dessert , plus the happy hour was buying you one for one free drink . Yes it was pricey but we did not mind because atmosphere/food was great, and it made to our holiday very nice memor
1
Decided to dine at this restaurant as the menu on display looked good. I'm afraid it went downhill from this point. The staff thought themselves to be very superior. We were dressed appropriately but obviously picked as tourists and treated like second class citizens. The Steaks were okay and the sides good but pricey. Wine list was extensive and also pricey. Our treatment by the staff, from the doorman to the table waitstaff, totally spoilt what should have been a dinning experience. We have dined in restaurants in many cities in the world but this would have to be one of our worst dining experiences.Would suggest Bistro Du Vin, Shaw Place
2
I selected this place to dine in because I really fancied a nice burger and my husband fancied a steak. The steak is priced at an obscene between $80 for a ribeye to $250 for a chateaubriand and tastes of nothing. The steak comes with nothing on the side so you need to order a side worth $20 to complement your steak. The burger which is very bad beef and a bun rolled with tomato ketchup and some bacon is a a gastronomic disaster. The macaroni cheese is fine and the French onion soup is 5 out of ten. The ambience is dead with weird music and the dark wood interiors do not lend themselves to a cheerful atmosphere. The general population comprises of unsuspecting foreigners.I would say "caveat emptor." for this one. Not for me ever. Sorry folks at those prices I need more to really tickle that palate.
4
So many friends raved about this place I relented and went there recently for lunch. On the plus side the service throughout was attentive and good so the comments about poor service (below) surprise me but then again it was lunch time and how many people want to spend $80+ for a steak lunch? Occupancy was probably about 30% at best. Judging by fellow diners it seemed to be banking types which should have prepared me better for the bill.The steaks to be blunt were thoroughly average and did not merit the prices and the sides were equally average including the much vaunted mac n' cheese. However the wine list was quite good if again over priced.For example the Cloudy Bay Pinot Noir retails at $60 but here was $120 so make no mistake you are paying handsomely here. All up the bill for 2 with 2 steaks,3 sides and wine was over $650 and as I always say,if it was exceptional fair does but Bedrock frankly is average from top to bottom. It is another one of these overrated Singapore eateries that thrive for a while on hype but in the long run cannot be sustained. Wont be going back

It's a sad truth that in Singapore experiencing good service has become a pleasant and rare surprise rather than the norm. But when you're paying more than $100 per person at a restaurant, you hope, at least, that the people serving will provide above average standards. After all if you're a restaurant with beautiful, warm and inviting decor, and wine, whisky and selections of meat that are a cut above (ha ha), then surely you want your quality of service to seal the deal in terms of a first class experience... Well, it started out that way... and then it all fell apart.We had a waiter who was extremely knowledgeable, told all the right jokes, gave us his recommendations took our orders for drinks, main courses and the little extras we asked for... and thus ended the "great service" part of our meal. Our cocktails didn't come out at the same time... so two of us were watching them getting watery while we waited for the other two. (Whisky sour wasn't citrus-y enough. But the Old Fashioned with rum got a repeat order!) About 20 minutes later our main courses started to come out (after some really lovely hot bread). Alas, our starters had been forgotten. The waiter apologised saying he thought we "had eaten them really fast." When we said to just cancel them we were told it was too late, they were already being cooked (we weren't asked if we still wanted them. It was just assumed). We did ask if we could sample all the house sauces. Initially this was met with hesitation, but after the starter boo boo, and a reminder about whether it was possible or not, they came. All of them were great... The food was excellent, and worth the "special occasion" price. I recommend the mac n cheese side, and if you're not a beef eater, the chicken is great. My companion loved her burger which is pure meat with no fillers (like egg white etc.) Steak was of course, got rave reviews. Halfway through our meal, our waiter all but disappeared. There were others, but frankly they seemed a bit dazed and confused. Two orders of drinks never came...we asked for water for everyone, it never came. We reminded this different waiter who now had appeared, he brought a single lonely glass. We asked for more... eventually it came.They cleared the table, and didn't wipe it. We ordered dessert and the fresh cutlery was placed in a big puddle of oil. We asked them to wipe it, so then, they did. We ordered the apple pie (extremely huge, and great tart apple and creamy vanilla ice-cream combo, but not enough crumble on top - as usually seems to be the case with crumbles). It didn't come for a long time. We saw it sitting, for ages, on the service counter. We asked another waiter to bring it. He seemed unsure of what to do. We watch him look nervously around, fumble a bit, stand confused etc etc... and finally he brought it. Just to put a cherry on the top of this service sludge fest, I asked for three of our leftovers to be packed, and I only got two. It's sad, because the food really is good. And I gave this place an overall rating of 4 because of that. If only they could ace the service too, then it would be an absolute gem of a restaurant. So temper your expectations, but know you'll have a hearty satisfying meal

Bedrock Bar and Grill is a good quality ,good value steakhouse with good service and reasonable prices .The steaks are well presented ,well cooked and very good quality ,side dishes were also very good .If you want a good meal ,reasonable prices in a busy location then this is the place to be 
5
Fantastic food here and a nice set up too. Great service as well. I shall be back.. Steaks are amazing.
4
Very good place to go for a special occasion. The steak is wonderful and the starters are all very interesting and well presented.
3
The steaks here are great and that's most important for all steak lovers. Well seasoned, nicely charred on the outside, cuts like a dream and a very juicy middle. We tried the aged USDA rib eye and the sirloin steak and between the two, the aged rib eye is the more recommended cut. Comes with an interesting variety of sauces, but really, the steaks required no sauces at all. The pricing is probably average if you compare it to some of the other steakhouses in Singapore offering a similar quality of meat. Dining here is a little akin to having an expensive steak in a setting that does not seem to have decided whether its casual or fine dining. The pricing is definitely fine dining and the overall look of the place is nice and warm with an interesting open kitchen. But the tables are very closely placed together, making it fairly cramped. If you wish to have a more intimate dinner, please book the booths which lines the sides of this restaurant. If you get placed on a regular table in the middle, you are literally able to touch the table next to you. It gets hard to enjoy your wonderful steak when you have waiters squeezing in between your tables to talk to other tables and then you actually wonder whether your 100 plus dollar steak was worth it.It is also fairly noisy when we were there. Yes, it was a full house but the area is quite small so the noise level of the music plus the patrons is almost heading towards a bar type ambience. For a casual dinner with friends - no problems at all. If you are here with your business associates - perhaps there are other venues that are more suitable.This place also has a 2 seating timing policy which personally is quite annoying. Service wise - they tried. But there are improvements that could be made especially on the phone and those at the front of the restaurant. We would return on the basis of the great steaks. If you focus on just the food alone, it is still one of the better steak houses around town

Hidden in one inconspicuous corner outside 313 mall, I've never took notice of this restaurant until we had to go there for dinner last night. We were visually impressed by the restaurant's layout and were extremely pleased with our assigned seats. Away from the crowd, we were given a table at the back of the restaurant, with only 2 tables in that private corner- it was quiet and nice.The service was really pleasant too, except we kept getting interrupted amidst our meal by different staff to check on us and our food.We settled for some Broiled Sea Scallops ($32) and Ribeye 400g ($89). Also, because the steak did not come with anything else, we had to order the sides, so we got some french fries (bleargh) and creamed spinach that were soooo yummy. The steak, was indeed mouth-watering as what everyone had said or reviewed, it was juicy with a pink centre, the charred parts were actually quite tasty, the steak was flavourful even without our whiskey mustard sauce. One of the best steaks in town definitely. Even though I had no idea what's the point of serving us the hot plate when the beef came 10-15 minutes later and the plates had already turned cold.I couldn't decide if I liked the sauce that came with the scallops, it was fresh nonetheless, but the portions were minuscule. It's quite absurd to pay $32 for only 2 scallops.The red wine was barely filled to a quarter of the glass- quite stringent with their alcohol eh?Oh yes, and the bread they served with butter and roasted garlic aside was soooo good! It was soft and warm from the oven. Unfortunately, we were stuffed to the brim to have any space for desserts, but we'll definitely be back again- just for the steaks and creamed spinach. :

Sometimes you feel like a carnivore. What can I say.After a couple of intense days of working, a client recommended this local steakhouse saying, in so many words, "(Insert name of famous chain) quality at half the price." He was not exaggerating.Tucked inside a shopping center adjacent to a hotel, this cozy steakhouse offered a full array of US grain-fed and Australian grass-fed beef, all of the popular cuts including the rarely seen "long-bone" ribeye.Supplemented by an interesting list of Aussie, NZ, Latin American and other world wines, Bedrock offered and delivered on my friend's proposition. We spent USD $300, which included a pricey but quite good Australian red and three side dishes, all of which are meant to share.The preparation was perfect, the service amusing and informed. Reservations are recommended but it appeared to this traveler as though one could just pop in when one suddenly fancied a good steak
4
This is a very good steakhouse just off Somerset Road. It is a bar on the outside and a simply decorated steakhouse on the inside. The food is very good indeed. We ordered the peppered steak, USDA ribeye and lobster tail. All excellent with an exceptional creamy spinach side. But, it's eye watering expensive for what is simply a good steak. Also, the service is polite, but a little intrusive....I know it's the way things seem to be done in Singapore, but many guests do not want staff to keep asking if they have finished. Leave us in peace to finish our meal together and then clear all the plates together. It's a little embarrassing when the response to the question is actually "no", I want to finish the remaining 5 French fries and soak up the remaining garlic cream sauce with the morsel of bread I had left from earlier. A minor fault, but one to keep in mind if you are charging >$200 per head and we only had one bottle of wine.
5
Visited Bedrock bar and grill today and have to say it was fantastic. I had the dry aged rib eye and my wife had the Bedrock pepper steak, and we shared the homemade apple crumble. The service was excellent and the steaks were perfectly cooked and very good quality meat. The waiters were very friendly and didn't interrupt our food too much like they do in some other restaurants. Will definitely be returning in the future.
5
I went to Bedrock bar and grill after a friend of mine organised a ‘guy’s night out’, and will without a doubt be returning. The bar had a huge range of whiskeys, including my personal favourite, the 21 year old Aberfeldy Whiskey. I would say nearly the whole party went for steaks and I didn’t hear a single complaint, my 9oz Wagyu Minute Steak with fine beans, french fries and shallot sauce was delicious! The staff were also great, not too overbearing but attentive enough; a great evening which I will certainly be repeating
4
Visited for a business dinner yesterday evening. I arrived earlier than my guest and managed to have a good look through the menu and I found the Sommelier to be very interesting and engaging too. He helped me select a nice full bodied Rioja to accompany the red meat ahead. The starter of scallops was perfectly cooked and the red wine reduction was delicious. For main course I had the steak burger which was juicy and together with the truffle fries enough to satisfy anyones appetite. My guest had the tenderloin which also looked very succulent. The mac and cheese side dish is well worth a try also. Be warned, the side dishes are pretty large. The asparagus was enormous. All in all a good, well made dinner. I agree with some other reviews that it may be a little on the pricey side though
4
I have been to this restaurant three times (twice within a space of 2 weeks) and I must say that they do know how to make a very good medium rare steak. While it is not cheap, it was worth the price to pay for extremely well prepared steaks! They served USDA prime. For those looking for BYO, they do not charge corkage on Monday nights
4
Steaks are decent but slightly overpriced. There used to be lunch time deals, not sure if that's still going on. Ambience is nice for small friends group or couples.
4
Nice list of steaks but very pricey for what it is. Service could have been better considering the restaurant was only a quarter full if that we had trouble attracting attention of the waiting staff. Great choice of cuts, excellent wine list and average staff.
4
Nice cozy atmosphere; dimmed lights; home made bread; very friendly service; steak perfectly cooked and nicely presented....but not very tasty. Same thing for the pan-fried foie gras and the roquette salad. No taste :(This restaurant has all the ingredients to be excellent (including the Laguiole knives, an elegant and expensive attention to detail) except for the quality of the food ingredients that should be -must be- upgraded. It would then deserve a 5* review
3
Went for a business lunch here for the first time and the place is nice, atmosphere quiet although can imagine it can be loud if a lot of people there.food was very good but the service was slow and often had to be called around instead of merely showing up on their own.If they can fix the service it will be a brilliant place I am sure
5
Overall an outstanding dinner - service and food were both excellent. The wine that the server suggested was superb and reasonably priced. The prices for the steaks are steep but the steaks are well worth it. The side of grilled mushrooms was one of the best I ever had. The pork chop was fantastic - well cooked, juicy and full of flavor. The bread and baked garlic were superb. The only issue was a sense of being hurried to dine quickly. Highly recommend
4
Some very good quality food but pricey....had mini burgers and also bone marrow which were excellent....fried food not the best in town....best go at happy hour if you drink or look for promotions at the bar....we we're here late Saturday night so we got hit up for a 300 SGD bill...but a good night for me and the wife as a splash out evenin
4
Located on Discovery walk behind the Pan Pacific along a happening restaurant row as part of 313. Sit on the patio and enjoy the people watching all evening long. Last night I had the best steak since moving to Singapore two years ago. Perfectly prepared pepper steak. Pricing is comparable to other steaks but this one delivers. Great happy hour wines. This place has a real vibe to it in the evenings. The burger is good as well. The two fish dishes offered on the regular menu are to sauce oriented for me. The catch of the day fish dish has never been available when we have been there. By adding a nice grilled fish the menu would be well rounded. Good Web site.
5
One of the best restaurant I ever went. The prices of the food are at the higher range and you pay for what you get. Steak is their signature dish (Sgd 80 to 100ish) but you can get alternatives like chicken or fish at a cheaper price compared to steak (sgd 30 to 50ish). Their food is absolutely delicious and I would recommend the restaurant to anyone who wants a good decent steak.The waiter and waitress are very polite and nice and they came around occasionally table tapping and checking with us whether everything is alright. We stayed till near the closing time and it was raining at that time. To our surprise, they offered to call a cab for us.This is a restaurant coupled with good food and services. Thumbs up

The steak was absolutely fastastic but the steak knife was poor. They should have made an effort to get a proper steak knife. The original dessert we ordered - bedrock forest cholate was incredibly bad, three stale chocolate cookies with some whipped cream. However, the replacement dessert of apple crumble was awesome. :

Ate here last night and enjoyed our experience. Shared the 400gm US Rib Eye with my husband. Really nice tasty meat and cooked to perfection. Sides of duck fat potatoes delicious. Service was very efficient and attentive. Very impressive collection of Whiskey if that is your thing. Will come back again

went for a drink, wait 15 min to have a wrong order
And the offer one + one is if you 2 people, you have to order 2 drinks to enjoy 2 others drinks....expensive also

Well shown to the table perfectly on time. The table has varnish peeling off of the wood so not aesthetically pleasing plus the staining from obvious hot dishes placed on it before. Maybe too late but they placed mats on the table for our dishes!. Like some before 4 people and the drinks order was messed up .. only three arrived and then was a university thesis to explain what we wanted . that leads to some staff are not that good. "could I have some salt and pepper please" but only the salt arrived even though she had her hand on both at one time .. The best service was from a waiter called Henry .. efficient, polite, informative and always discreetly around. That was the best part.Salad is limp, tasteless Ceaser dressing and bland throughout. Do they make plastic bacon and chicken? The deep fried Camembert is like a cheese soup and after you scald your mouth it congeals as a condom all over your teeth ... not the "normal" deep fried type.Now we all had steaks, yes cooked as we wanted, but they are good, they are not very good, they are certainly not excellent. Much better steaks in town for the money (or more of course) The wine list is not exciting and has lots and lots of those annoying little orange spots " not available" .. at a guess I would suggest at least 25% if not 30% are marked such.Maybe I will try it again .. its not bad, its good but not great or above average ...

Went there thanks to a friend blogger who reviews restaurants in singapore: Seth Lui.It is really one of the best steaks i ever had, and the mac&3cheese is the greatest side for it. Dont forget to order their WhiskySour, pretty good as well.Forget about the "Cut", Bedrock is much better

I think this is more of a dinner place, but nevertheless, I went for lunch. They have a very decent lunch set at $59 for 3 courses including steak. It's definitely on the pricier side but I found it was excellent value for money as all 3 courses were generously portioned. I enjoyed the starter and dessert but the highlight was the steak. Only downside was that the service was a bit patchy. Bedrock is a real gem in the hustle & bustle of Orchard Road. If you want the real Bedrock experience, you're better off going for dinner but their lunch sets are definitely worthwile for a special treat or business lunch

Felt like a steak dinner tonight. I went to Bedrock Bar and Grill along the Discovery Walk behind 313 Somerset. It's on the ground floor of the Pan Pacific Serviced Suites.They have a few tables outside where they have a happy hour beer promotion. Inside the bar and restaurant have a nice wood theme decor. Good ambiance.To start with I had the Roasted Bone Marrow (a beef bone sawn along it's length and roasted. You scoop out the marrow and eat it on Melba toast). It was good. Quite rich but good. Then I had an 18 ounce Porterhouse steak with Potatoes cooked in duck fat and some whole grain whiskey mustard. The steak was very good, the Duck fat potatoes crisp outside, soft inside and delicious.The choice of dessert on the menu was a bit disappointing. I would have liked a good Bread butter pudding or a rum or whiskey based chocolate mousse.The bar menu is quite good. I had some good Chilean wine with my steak.On the menu they have a Tomahawk Steak, a long bone, Wagyu Ribeye steak. I saw it drooled and resisted the temptation of overeating.... it was 1.9 kilos ! One day when I'm really hungry, I'll take up the challenge.Service was good, staff were friendly. When you get to the table they serve you a hot, pita like bread, fresh out of the oven with butter and a bulb of roasted garlic in olive oil.The restaurant is closed on Sundays

My wife and I ate here last night. We both opted for the 14oz USDA rib-eye. Put simply, they were arguably the best steaks we have ever eaten. The steaks are a decent size without being too big however, don't go overboard with the sides. For a couple, two sides ought to be enough if you're planning on a desert. We had three because my wife wanted asparagus and I wanted the spinach, along with the duck fat potatoes.The ambience was wonderful and the service was superb. The staff were on hand when needed, glasses were refilled when required (and not just for the sake of it). They were courteous, helpful and professional. My wife returned from the bathroom to find her napkin refreshed - very nice touch.Some reviews have said that the food is over-priced. Well, compared to a similar sort of steak house in, say, the United States then I guess it is. Compared to other steak houses in Singapore, it's on a par.The wine list is very good however, some of the wines are eye-wateringly expensive. If you like a soft red, go for the Robert Mondavi California Merlot. At S$90 a bottle, you won't go far wrong.I shall most definitely go back. Next time, I shall opt for the 10oz USDA dry-aged rib-eye. Or maybe the rack of ribs

I have been going to Bedrock since they opened and was always a big fan. Good steaks, decent seafood and good veggies at a reasonable price. However, after five years of the same menu with absolutely no changes, the place is getting a little tired. Worse yet, I was there Thursday nov 14th and it is clear that they have brought in the B team to manage the place. The arrogant manager insisted (despite our appeals) on keeping the music too loud to converse, despite there being only two full tables when I asked him to turn it down. Luckily, the lovely waitress did her best to make up for the bad management. In summary, same old good food, but in desperate need of some new menu items and a new manager that knows how to treat loyal customers

Really nice place on Somerset, not far from Takashimaya. This was my second time, and my thoughts remain the same. Great steak selection, both Australian and USA. Nice starters, including Jamon Iberico Bellota from Spain, and really solid selection of side orders. Wine list is heavily weighted towards Australia... kind of makes sense in this part of the world. Service was friendly if a bit hit and miss, but not a problem in any way. Nice meal

I hesitate to give this restaurant the top rating only because I think it is overpriced. The steaks we had were really very good --- some gristle at the end of my USDA aged rib-eye would keep me from marking it superb. It was very flavorful and it was cooked to my medium rare specification. I thought the sides my companions chose were excellent --- the mushrooms and creamy potatoes especially (I don't especially love broccolni so I left that one to the others). I also very much liked the bernaise (sp?) sauce --- as well as the two appetizers the three of us shared (bone marrow and the tomato salad -- the latter really was superb). Dessert (the waffle sandwich with figs and, I think macadamia nuts/flavor in the ice cream) was certainly tasty.The service was prompt and helpful without being overbearing. However, even recognizing that this is a steak place, pure and simple, I thought the pricing was about 25-35% too high

A great little steak restaurant just off the hustle and bustle of Ochard. Great wine list, and although it has been around for while is still a fine contender for best steak in the city against bigger names like Cut and Mortons. Will definitely go bac

Rack of lamb was good, with right wine recommendation to go with it, and the service good. Nice ambience for a dinner date.

I love food here. Yummy grilled bone marrows and the portion is huge. Jamon Iberico to jam with a glass of red wine is great. I love rack of lamb there. It's cooked for perfection! Love it!

Bedrock has fantastic food. The steaks are not so ridiculously sized unlike some other steak restaurants so you can actually manage to fit in som side dishes. And they are really good; the mac and cheese and grilled Camembert especially as well as the amazing deserts. The atmosphere is the other strong point, really chilled out. Service is attentive without being overbearing

I went for lunch with a friend and I had never heard of this place, he picked it. It is perfectly located outside Somerset MRT station and has the convenience of a taxi stand just outside the main building.Having said that, the ambience is modern, friendly and great. They offer a variety of dishes which in my opinion they cook and serve really well.For lunch, like many other restaurants, they offer specials with set lunch options with either two or three courses (but you can make it four if you are hungry and happy to pay an extra $6 for the soup of the day).We both took the option of the three courses lunch and it was all really tasty and cooked excellently. The highlight were the "chopped steak burger" and the "bone in striploin". A place I will definitely visit more in the future as it is suitable for a similar lunch or not too formal dinner with partner and/or friends

Came here after reading several recommendations. The restaurant is on the property of the Pan Pacific Serviced apartments on Orchard Road. The darkened interior gave a nice sense of intimacy and is good for a date night. We ordered a ribeye, which the wife and I shared due to its sheer size. We ordered medium, but it really came out medium-well instead, which was a disappointment. Otherwise, the steak was flavourful. We also shared the crumble for two, which was a nicely prepared dessert. The wine list was not sufficiently extensive for a steakhouse, and frankly, expensive. We brought out own bottle and was charged $30 corkage (expected).Tip: Park at the Pan Pac and you can get parking reimubursed

To cut a long review short, the steak here is far better than at Mortons , which is pretty much the gold standard, for many, in Singapore. I ordered the tenderloin,medium rare and my review is based on that.The complimentary flat bread , which in reality is a small Indian 'Naan", is baked fresh and served hot with a whole steamed garlic is quite unusual and delicious.No the garlic is not smelly ;~)The service is friendly and the restaurant has a nice wooden feel

Was in the mood for a nice steak - ala Gaucho Grill type found in London. I think Bedrock comes closest but even Bedrock is way pricier.Location:Right in the hear of Singapore in the 313 Somerset Mall. The address mentions Pan Pacific Suites but in reality, its just in the mall area next to the Marche. Easy to find. Atmosphere:Went there on Wednesday night for dinner. Was rather quiet. I reckon it was slightly less than half full so it was good for conversations. Personally I dont think the tables were that crammed together. Nice set up and would be good for dates, romantic evenings or even groups.Food:Its a steak restaurant and I do like the simplicity of the menu. Grills grills and more grills. Had to Aussie Ribeye which coming in at 400g did fill me up. I asked for Medium and it was cook right. I had to order the sauce separately and was disappointed to find only 5 choices and that didnt include the peppercorn sauce. Opted for the french mustard which to me was only ok. My dining half had the Bedrock pepper steak which came with a delicious pepper sauce.We ordered creamed spinach and duck fat potatoes. Have to say, sides were disappointing. The creamed spinach was too sweet somehow and the duck potatoes were not sufficiently roasted and not seasoned.Service:Was very good but felt that it was way overattentive. Barely had we sat down with the menu for less than 2 mins when we were asked if we were ready to order drinks. Drinks:Good selection of drinks - cocktails and wines by the bottle. Disppointing was the limited choices for wine by the glass. The damage:Meal for two including steaks, sides, drinks, service but no starter hit around S$250 (Â£130) to the wallet.Final recommendation:Overall, prices are expensive but not much more for "fine dining" type establishments in Singapore. I would not mind trying it again when I am in the mood for a nice grill

I've been there for lunch a few times now, the atmosphere is excellent and the staff have always been very attentive and very friendly. More so than most similar type restaurants around. Ive tried the steaks and also the set menu. Whereas the steak is certainly not cheap, the overall 'steak' experience I would say is better than Mortons. The lunch set-menu however is very well priced and a definite must try. If you are not entirely sure what you want to try, definitely go for one of the set lunch options - you would not be dissapointed

My husband and i have gone here few times, each time we have a good meal! If you don't mind spending, you can get a wonderful steak and the service has been friendly and attentive so far. (Something that is becoming rare in non hotel operated restuarants in Singapore..) I also tried their tuna steak, which was excellent. But Bedrock is for Steaks afterall. They have great Onion Rings too! It has a good mix of crowds - Locals, expats, families, friends, couples, business. If you are looking for steak and have not tried this place yet in Singapore, it is worth checking out for yourself

I felt like a good steak and I got it at Bedrock. However, like so many 'western' restauarants in Singapore, it was expensive, over S$400 for two with one 'cheap' bottle of wine. I wasn't impressed with the duck fat potatoes, they tasted just like basic roast potatoes to me, and not even particularly good ones at that and the rocket and parmesan salad was just leaves and shaved parmesan. We felt like an extra glass of wine at the end of the meal and were offered a taste of their 'wine of the month' in advance of buying a glass (@ S$30). Thank goodness we did, as the bottle had been open for ages and the wine was completely stale - a shame as it had ruined what would otherwise have been a lovely barbera d'asti
