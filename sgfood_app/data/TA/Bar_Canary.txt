Recently renovated, we now have a comfortable open air bar with plenty of room for relaxing and enjoying the ambiance. Amazingly pleasant in the middle of Singapore.The bar has the benefit of two of the best staff, being Deepend and Evie.Attentive and courteous but not intrusive a fine balance to achieve and these people do it.The drinks are great too.Three visits already and more to come during our stay. Each time a warm welcome and Deepend & Evie remember our favourites. A big plus, thanks guys

Ck the f&b manager was a very welcoming to us, thank you very nuch! However the waiterss gave a very poor service and much made me very disappointed. 1. I bought a package A at a event at Audio Translate and had a Premium bottle, Champagne bottle, and a party platter. I reached the event pretty late, at about 12.30am. Asked for my premium bottle from the witress. As it was only the 2 of us at first & was waiting for the rest to arrive. I then asked what time the kitchen close & if its okay for her (a young tomboy lookig lady) to imform me wheb the kitchen is closing & i would like to be served much later. She then kindly agrees to my request. Then later in the night, an indian looking male approached me and asked if i have another food to order as kitchen is going to close. And he mentioned that its actually too late for the kitchen to prepare my party platter. Which is very dispointing. I seek your kind attention to this & please arrange for a service recovery if possiable. Thank you very much

Drinks were expensive and so so only. No difference between smoking and non smoking areas cause it's open areas anyway so you will still smell cigarette. Halfway drinking we saw feathers dropping to the floor. Not sure if there were birds resting at the top of the hotel knowing during evening and night time there will be a lot of birds in orchard road. One of the staff wasn't polite as well and didn't smile to greet us. I won't return again

Love the place!!FUN and cosy! ðŸ’•âœ¨Perfect for parties and chill out nights!Food was great!!Would definitely be back again!

I was here for a beautiful rooftop pool party with friends. Amazing location, clean and very central. Good vibes!

Bar Canary is a good place to chill with friends especially for short gathering. Nice atmosphere and attentive staffs!
5
Bar manager mr ryan is good. Whole team is experienced bartender. Look for mr veeran for Dora Special mocktail. TLC from mr ryan. Smoke friendly open concept area really relaxing and enjoyable
4
Ambience was good, great place to chill with friends over food & drinks. Wasn't crowded for a saturday night.

This place is great and convenient if you are staying in Orchard. Go when the weather is not too hot cause it's an open air bar. Cocktails variety here is great. Not too little and not too many in the list so you don't get disappointed or get bombarded with too much to choose from. The cocktails here are really refreshing and some are served in this ol stool metal tumbler which keeps the drink pretty cool. Only thing I didn't quite like was that I felt like the waiter was "pushing" me to order my drink the first few minutes when I sat down to join my friends. Other than that, this bar is a pretty great place to chill and hang out with friends.
5
This was my very first ladies' night and my expectation was met with a great and friendly service at Bar Canary. Tucked away off the noisy Orchard Road, it sits on the 4th floor of Grand Park Hotel. The food offers are limited but all delicious. It's hard to beat the free-flow champagne (Perrier Jouet) as well as house wine and spirits for $50++. This is a place I will come back.
4
Great for groups because of their beat the clock drink menu! Atmosphere is relaxing yet posh. Service was ok... only reason I didn't do 5 stars. When we asked the server to take a photo of our group he said he was too busy but came back to reluctantly take the photo. A bit rude on service if you ask me. Otherwise great place.
5
Bar Canary is a very good place to chill, talk and just enjoy the company with whoever you go with. The ambience is fantastic, music isn't loud and the place sits on a roof is just fantastic. Would definitely go back again and would recommend anyone who hasn't to go and experience it themselves. Cheers

I have been wanting to go to Bar Canary for the longest time, but it always seems to be booked for private events! Eventually secured a reservation but instead of the mor comfortable seats, my partner and I were shown to a couple of beanbag chairs. I suppose I could've put a special request into the reservation for better seats but beanbags, seriously? The drinks were alright, tasty but overly sweet with no alcoholic kick. And we paid $44+ for just 2 drinks. I can't say it was value for money.The ambience was pretty but totally ruined by the number of smokers who sat near us. It would be great if there are separate sections for smoker and non-smokers! We left in less than an hour due to the amount of fumes which were blown out way.Service staff were brusque. Don't know where the manager was, I've met him once when they were closed and he was so apologetic and nice.Won't be coming back, such a pity as the bar looks nice
5
the food was good , drinks were good , atmosphere was excellent . paid $120 in total for the two of us . it was a total value for money ^^ would definitely come back again for drinks at night .
5
awesome fodo and ambience and was a delight to go there with my friends and have a good drink together with them
5
bar canary is the best chill out spot for couples/ friends. Drinks are reasonably priced during happy hours. And the service was also excellent. Super friendly crew and look forward to going back again!
3
Kind of a dreary place. Service was slow and a bit disinterested. Would definitely return for the happy hour though, however only if we bring enough friends to lighten up the ambiance.
4
We had a nice evening out, nice busy place , lounge bar outside in middle of Singapore Orchard Road. Service could be a touch better. Overall nice place for some pre drinks or just sit/lie around. Food a bit more choice would be nice.
4
Good little hidden place. Cool place to cool down with the hot weather. Very good ambience a cool spot
4
2 staff seen managing the bar but i had no problems getting attention. Excellent service especially from Ryan. Very well run. Did not give 5 rating because i felt that the cushions and seats need a refreshment. Its bright yellow coloured and need a refreshment- too many aged and weather stains. Best if they had more happy hour promos. 2 pax cant handle 8 glasses!
5
My husband and I have been here a few times. This bar has great seating area, but no views. The service, food and drinks promo are good as well.We did order the duck spring rolls and was surprised to receive mayonnaise has the dipping sauce. It's best to serve it with plum sauce
4
The Canary bar in the Grand Park Orchard Hotel was a welcome sight after a hard day of retail therapy. Set just apart from the reception area of the hotel and beside the lap pool. Very pleasant staff in a happy, yellow environment. Walking up and down Orchard it was hard to find a bar as Aussies know it, so this was the next best thing. Prices indicative of Singapore however, so it doesn't take long to spend some money especially if your thirsty! $16 for a glass of wine.and $18 for a Jimmy
5
Is my 2nd time there, I find their "beat the clock" aka happy hour is a pretty good deal, a bottle of wine and 4 cocktails if you are there at 6. Is only $60+++. Other than this attractive bundle deal, their service staffs are attentive and amazing. Sending my thanks to Ryan. He is amazing! And got us a complimentary birthday cake for my gf. Park hotel never fails me. Thank you very much 
5
provided the smoking are, good modern decor, good bartenders and a range of cocktails. This is one of the good bars around central orchard. + convenient.
4
This place is good and nice soft music as well! The bar men are very good and their services are excellent! Nice and quiet and I was there more often because I was staying in this hotel so it was very convenient!
5
This Bar is fantastic, the best part about it is watching people staying at the hotel having to shuffle across you to get to the pool, oh, and of course the ingenious drinks.

If you are game in trying different kinds of cocktails, do head to Bar Canary! They serve a good selection of Canary Creations and Classic Inspired Cocktail. Each cocktails gives you a special surprise. Besides that, there is this Beat The Clock Promotion which is available daily 6pm to 9pm where you can choose from a bucket of 8 bottled beers or a set of a bottle of house red or white wine and your choice of 4 signature cocktails from $60++ at 6pm, $70++ at 7pm, $80++ at 8pm and $90++ at 9pm.Bartender Ryan is very welcoming and friendly. He mixs great cocktails as well! My friends and I enjoyed our time at Bar Canary! Will definately revisit

my friends and i were looking for a nice place to drink and chill and chanced upon bar canary. we decided to give it a try as the happy hour offer was really value for money. i must say we were really pleased. ryan was serving us and his service was impeccable. he's definitely a role model for the rest of his colleagues.the cocktails we had were definitely above our expectations. the 3 of us each had our favorites of berry bright bikini, sugar n spice, and endlesss summer. different types of taste to suit the different palates. we were surprised on our first sips and felt like we were being transported to another country!the crispy duck roll, truffle fries and portobello mushroom was pretty good too! only wished they had chicken wings too.only downside was there was only outdoor sitting and we felt a little warm. there was also smokers (from the hotel) smoking there and hence we were forced to become passive smokers. we were seated to the seats nearest to the bar and right beside the bin. perhaps it would be good to segregate smoking and non smoking area. alternatively you can try to sit nearer to the pool.. and if you are lucky that the people beside don't smoke, you'll have some fresh air for a couple of hours. overall definitely a great place to hang and chill with friends. we have already decided to wear shorts the next time and sit and the middle cushion area. good job guys, to ryan and team! :

When my friends first brought me to Bar Canary, I knew this is the perfect place to chill and relax after work. Last Friday, I decided to introduce my friends to this wonderful place and I made a reservation for 3pax at 8.30pm. However, my friends were running late and I called the reservation number that was provided on their website. The lady from Mitzo restaurant (both Mitzo and Bar Canary has the same number as shown on their website) picked up the phone and agreed to my changed timing of 10pm. However when I arrived at 10pm, the gentlemen from Bar Canary denied my reservation as he said I missed my reservation timing and I had to be waitlisted. When I explained that I did call up to change the reservation timing, he confidently said he did not recieve the call. I showed him the number on the reservation confirmation email, i think he noticed the number provided was from Mitzo restaurant and he realised it was a miscommunication on their end. What really disappoint me was that he was not apologetic and sounded as if I was the one in the wrong. As a hotelier myself, this level of service is really unacceptable. It really felt embarrassing when you have already brag to your friends about how wonderful this place is but your reservation gets brutally rejected just because of internal miscommunication. I sincerely hope that the staff service training can be relooked and I do want to regularly visit Bar Canary again.

A chic poolside lounge by day, Bar Canary serves as a respite for shoppers and also the ideal spot to take the edge off a busy work day as it offers breezy boozing and exceptional offers on drinks and boozy pops that are a rare find in its Orchard neighbourhood.Located on the same level as the Grand Park Orchard lobby, on a outdoor setting with low slung, canary yellow deck seating as well as a glowing BC sign, Bar Canary is an uber-chic poolside bar where you can go barefooted on the lush turfs and chill under the stars. Enjoy great beats and boozy pops!Read more about our experience on darrenbloggie.co

Overpriced drinks and soulless atmosphere do not make the Bar Canary a winner. I should have known better when on entering the bar I saw the bar staff looking at their mobile phone screens.Service was dismissive and not commesurate with the very expensive and tasteless martini. My business associate was also served a similarly disappointing martini. So it was not a 'one off'.Unfortunately there are many locales of this kind in Singapore -pretentious 'lifestyle' packages with no substance.Do not recommend

No one here to get a beer ! Disappointing for a hotel bar. And the pool for the hotel is in the bar, I am not sure this would be appropriate for a lot of travellers that would like some sort of pool privacy ! It's clearly not a pool bar either as its CLOSED!
4
Bar Canary is gorgeous! It's a relaxing spot for good weather because there isn't shelter should you find yourself caught in the rain. The happy hour deal is well worth it and the cocktails are as delicious as they are pretty-sounding. Unfortunately, getting a staff's attention when you're far out the back is quite hard but they try hard so can't fault them for that. Would definitely recommend it if you want somewhere to chill or bring a visitor. A friend of mine said it made her feel like she's in New York.

Great Girls Night Out at Bar Canary. Hadn't been here for about a year & was pleasantly surprised with the new decor. Champagne flowed really well during the 2 hour free flow. Well worth a visit.
4
Ryan the assistant manager was extremely hospitable and provided immaculate service to my family and i. Had a great picnic brunch experience, albeit the scorching singapore sun. Otherwise, perfect
5
They keep the drinks menu simple for cocktails and will give some advice if you are not sure what you want. Have nice cushions if you want to be fully relaxed or nice seat d area by the pool. Staff excellent.
5
Great place to hang out over drinks but must reserve.. Friendly service.. Drinks were ok.. But we didn't try the food
4
Chill place to hang out with your friends - Never have thought that you'll find a rooftop bar in the middle of town!
4
Very nice afterword chill out place .. Went on a Tuesday thus not much people which is good as it not noisy nor crowded. Not a very big place with very limited food selection. But the service man was very good, having very good service!
4
Nice atmosphere, Nice people, Nice cool Beer. The music was also entertaining. Some visitor are guest staying in the Hotel but a lot were from outside. Good relaxing time.
5
Great atmosphere, smack in the middle of Orchard road and such a great secluded place overlooking the lights of Paragon.
5
My wife and I visited the Bar Canary daily during our stay at the hotel.I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a relaxed environment for a quiet drink, cocktail with great music and environment.Staff will do everything they can to ensure you have the best time
4
Love their Boozy Pop Cocktails. They were very refreshing for our humid weather. Although they didn't have many service staff when we were there on a weeknight, they were very prompt with their service. When I griped that it was very warm, because the place is completely outdoor, the staff very quickly turned their giant portable fan to our direction
5
Great Wednesday evening spot for champs! Right on Orchard Rd and they are generous with the pours. Friendly staff.
4
Love the ambience, staffs r great. If they can serve more variety of food, it will be perfect. Would go back again
5
Great signature cocktails and great atmosphere at night. Service was good and the open air seating inviting.
5
Great service & recommendation of cocktails! Will be back for ladies' night! The Booze Popsicles & Coco Chanel are must tries!
5
Great for first dates, romantic nights and a quiet evening with your partner. Ambience and setting was perfect!
5
Service was amazing, as was the food & ambience! Definitely would recommend for a chill night out!!!
4
Ladies Night - always popular - and loved it. Especially VC nights - thank you Bar Canary. Outdoor seating can get very hot and humid though.
4
a nice outdoor bar with good music, friendly staff where smokers are welcome too. Good ambiance and nice drinks selection
4
relaxing with good drinks, friendly staff , very nice on the pool side, you just to drink, listen to the music
4
This bar is very unique in being outside in the busy Orchard road hotel with some space to meet people and have business events. The weird thing is the hotel guests going to the pool walking past you, better when it's closed off for a business event, the space and open airness works well. Staff are very cool too, food and drink nice and ok priced. Recommend for business meets with a difference in the middle of Orchard Roa
