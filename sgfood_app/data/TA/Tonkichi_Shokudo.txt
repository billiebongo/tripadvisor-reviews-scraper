Visited this restaurant for dinner as the family is around Suntec City.Saw the entrance and thought it should be the same chain of restaurant serving tonkatsu as the one at Taka himaya.Anyway, great tonkatsu. Same taste as the one at Takashimaya. Good and nice pork loin

Visited for Sunday dinner in Jul 16. Chose to dine here as we can see the restaurant is not that busy. Small dining outlet with only 1 male waiting staff. He was awesome. Cheerful and welcoming. Recommended us to order the round shape port cutlet (there is a name but I forgotten) telling us it is more tender and juicy. Gosh, he was right. When you bite the pork cutlet, the crispiness outside and the soft, tender and jucy meat inside. Wow, you won't have problem biting it.This was served with shredded cabbage. Eat the cabbage after a bite of pork cutlet. Yummy. We also ordered the ramen, unagi bento set and cold soba. All never disappoint us. We paid about $70+ for 4 person. Worth it as the experience was good
