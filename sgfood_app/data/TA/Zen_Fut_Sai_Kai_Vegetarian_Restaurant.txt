We went for dinner and we also ordered a take away. The fried rice and monkey mushroom with pumpkin sauce was extremely delicous. Service was quite fast too. Their noodles are tasty as well.

Probably didn't order the right combination of food as it was all a bit too similar. But it was tasty and the staff were pleasant.Would recommend.

This has been our favourite vegetarian restaurant for decades. The Cantonese cuisine is very nice and you will usually forget that it is a vegetarian restaurant. It is a small setup, so you would need to call to make reservations.

The food at the restaurant was not too bad unique fusion style of vegetarian but the service from the old man was horrible. The face is not even friendly and serve us with a “i owe you money face”. What is worse is that he also spill the soup on my pant and leg when he clear the plates. He is not even apologetic and still treat it as there is nothing that has happened. The younger guy was more friendly. I cannot believe how can this restaurant hire someone who show such black face at work. Visit at your own risks.

We went for a Mother's Day dinner this month and we waited for an hour before our food was served. The families beside us also had to wait for an hour. There were only 2 service staff on duty in the whole restaurant which was very much short-staffed to be serving several tables of customers. We had to self-service and take our own bowls, cutleries, sauces, tea refills needed as there was just insufficient staff! Food served was slow and mediocre as there was only 2 chefs on duty as told by the service staff.We had to do very much most of the things ourselves and yet, the restaurant still charged 10% service fees. I feel that there's very much to improve on the service times as well as staff response. Won't be back anytime soon though.

My family ate here for dinner. Since there were 9 of us, we were able to try quite a few of the different dishes. Loved all the mock meats. The crispy noodles were also really good. The restaurant has such a homey feeling with the staff cutting veges at a table near ours. Will definitely come back next time we are in Singapore

Venturing into Zen is adventuring back to the 50s. Go feel it. Feast your eyes on Holy Scriptures, Religious Paintings, Divine Writings, Goddess of Mercy figurines - the works.Food is mostly fresh greens and varied grabs of mushrooms delicately stir fried and subtly seasoned. Mock meat and dough items don't feature much in servings unless you specifically order such.And the staple house-proud achar (pickles) is exquisite. Different from the Malay or Peranakan versions - better.K.F. Seetoh waxed lyrical in his write up, newsclipping plastered on the restaurant's wall, crooning that he had found 'Veggie Nirvana'.On the opposite wall are well labelled photos of speciality dishes. Consider them for banquets or intimate celebrations. Order in advance. They don't come easy...Mango Harmony with Chicken Breast. Lo Mei. Cereal Prawns. Fatt Choy Mushroom. Golden Beancurd wth Luffa Gourd. Fresh Lily Bulbs wth Celery, Water Chestnuts & Ham. Braised Superior Albalone. Crispu Spring Rolls.Besides the above usual suspects, Sundays have soupy vegetable curry to drown your beehoon in.Come dine in Zen...and have No Regrets

Struggling to find vegetarian food near my hotel, I just tried my luck with TA - searched for vegetarian friendly and went to the nearest one. We let the proprietor recommend, and everything was delicious and great value. Went with two non-vegetarian friends who loved the food too

Brilliant vegetraian chinese option in singapore, strategically close to little india as well. It is like walking into the living room of a chinese family. Very endearing hosts, good home made meal and all in all a good evening spent.

recommend this old traditional chinese vegetarian restaurant. many monks and nun frequent this place. food is tasty and good for reasonable price food. portions large so careful not to over order.

Visited here for lunch. Big servings: 2 dishes are enough for 3 diners! Dish prices start from SGD7 after price revision.
Fine and light-tasting food.

We've been to this restaurant twice now and loved it each time. The food is fresh, simple and healthy and the service friendly. The serves are very generous and the waiters will let you know when they think you have ordered enough! The pickled vegetables are fantastic and the huge plate of fried wantons are worth coming back for! We also had the clay pot vegetables, ma-po tofu and fried noodles which were also all very good. Our first visit to the restaurant coincided with the Chinese mid-autumn festival when they were doing a roaring trade selling moon-cakes. We had one full of an amazing variety of nuts and spices which really was out of this world

Since I've been taken along by friends to other places where homely Chinese food is served, I could tell this is the hallmark of this place as well. I noticed a few repeat customers interacting with the owners and even the kitchen staff, so they do also have loyal customers.My wife and I however found the food lacking much flavor. We ordered the Dumpling Soup and a Mixed Vegetable Claypot. The portions are huge. The owner made sure we didn't order too much - I'd like to thank her for that. The Claypot had fresh veggies so we enjoyed that with rice, but otherwise both lacked much flavor. I'm willing to concede however that I might be spoiled by more flavorful Chinese dishes in restaurants back home.It was also difficult to order since the menu had no description of the items on it. There were no beverages listed but she did ask whether we wanted something to drink. I struggled a bit to communicate since she wasn't very comfortable with English. They appeared understaffed since it took a while to even notice we were in the restaurant. Otherwise service was quick, the staff was literally rushing around to keep up and they were helpful whenever they could afford it

We had a reunion dinner after my sis came back from overseas after 7 years. Our dad revealed he and our late mom first visited about 30 years ago. Food is of the home-cooked type. An all-in-the-family sort of restaurant crew. Where we said it looks like an ancestral hall; with a picture of an old lady staring down at us. I suspect she is the founder Be assured it is authentic Buddhist-compliant food. International visitors frequent the place. For the 7 of us and 7 dishes with rice the bill came to S$112. Getting there via the MRT at Farrer Park. After dinner one could shop at the nearby City Mall or pop into a pub. Beware the neighbourhood is crowded with foreign workers and watch out for pickpockets. This veg restaurant is worth your visit. Go around 6 when it is not so crowded

Ok, in fairness I need to say I'm not a vegetarian but more importantly my wife is. We went to this restaurant on our first night in Singapore having read all the rave reviews and frankly I don't mind eating Asian vegetarian foods, we found the restaurant exactly as described decor wise. Neither of us have any complaints about this, when in Rome etc, and found the staff charming. We went on a Sunday and were informed by the staff " Today you lucky, Sunday special day ". It appears that only on Sunday do they serve a vegetable curry which, along with a selection of other dishes, we duly ordered.The vegetable curry was without a doubt the best I have ever tasted, as for the rest I found them to be boringly bland, colourless and without flavour. I thought it was just me, as I say I'm not vegetarian so perhaps my pallet demands more flavour, but my wife who is a confirmed vegetarian totally agreed.My advice, go on a Sunday and have the vegetable curry. It was delicious but give the rest a miss

Very traditional, old school slow service, so be forewarned if you are not comfortable in going back to the 1960s. This place has got a long history and I got there often for lunch alone as I'm a vegetarian. I love their mee pok, wantons, and all the noodle dishes

Before I start my review, I thank SingaporeViews for reviews about this restaurant and also replying me to my private messages. Lots of Indians visit Singapore and I find it very surprising when they keep on asking for 'Good-Indian-Food' even while in Singapore. I am a Chinese food buff and when I visited Singapore this time, I thought why not try local dishes. I could make a big list of 'Non-Indian-Vegetarian' Food. Zen was on top of the list. I was with 3 youngsters and were around Little India. Its on the back side of Mustafa and quite easy to find. We reached by about 9 pm and found the restaurant fully packed. Waited for a couple of minutes and the lady at the counter made us sit on one of those very big Circular tables. The ambiance has an old charm, older photographs on the wall and the furniture. We ordered for Yong Chow Fried Rice, Friend Wanton, Noodles (do not remember exact name). As I knew the portion will be big, I gave only 3 dishes order even though we were quite hungry. It took some time before the dishes reached our table. It was very Yummm & was a real feast to our very tiring first day. We relished the food, the old ambiance, quite reasonable rates, location, in fact everything about this restaurant. It was a very good start to our Singapore tour. Do bring your own water, else the lady will charge about S$ 1 for a glass of water. How to reach:Zen Fut Sai Kai Vegetarian Restaurant (佛世界) +65 6291 2350, 147 Kitchener Road, Singapore. Tues – Sat 10am – 9:30pm, Tue – Sun: 10:00 am – 09:30 pm (Closed On Mondays). Farrer Park MRT, Walking 4 mins from Exit I to here, near to Tai Hoe / ParkRoyal Hotel. Thanks SingaporeViews - you were perfect in describing Zen.“YUMMY VEGETARIAN NOSTALGIA THAT IS EASY ON THE WALLET

This is the closest one gets to an eatery shack in modern SIN City. Time is frozen. Faded posters and those almost sepia photos adorn its walls. Food is true to tradition. The exquisite taste and texture of vegetarian food in indeed Zen in is zenith here.Service is homely, unobtrusive, much desired. A huge mirror of a begone age beckons. It towers above photos of dishes - a welcome guide to help you decide what to order.Try their pickles... curried, crunchy, perky.When we visited, moon cakes galore greeted us. Their specialities will hold you spell bound. Their 3-mushroom goodies were exciting... always. Their 5-nut variety subtle and addictive.We had crispy wanton, veggie noodles, olive fried rice, slightly sugared chrysanthemum tea.Its a simple, comforting pick-me-up that is heaven sent
