Best outlet with consistent food quality and Service as usual. Enjoy at each visit. Sorry ate all the food and forgot to take pics.

Good atmosphere but average food and service.
I had a few plates of sushi from sushi train and Cha soba. Found nothing special. Maybe better order your sushi from the menu. Dipping sauce for soba was very plain - almost tasteless.

One of the best choices here. Pricey but not too bad. Toilets are far from the restaurant. Sat pm there was a queue.

This place have a good ambience, friendly staff, good sashimi, good drink. Everything is good, except the price.. Well a good Japanese restaurant almost always with an expensive prices.

Visited this restaurant on our way out of Spore on 7 Jan with my family. Nice japanese ambience. Food is all tasty. Sushi Tei quality standard. Waitress was quick and well-knowledged about the F&B in the menu book. Thumbs up!

Sushi tei is a trusted name . Not super expensive and satisfy my salmon cravings! Sashimi is fresh.i love the aburi salmon. At sgd 4.80 for two pieces, it is quite a good deal. Chawamushi is flavourful. It may run out if you come too late. Overall a decent japanese eatery serving good quality sush

My wife and i have eaten here a few times, generally the service is good and food is ok.On our last visit however we had to wait 35min for 1 meal, after 20min I inquired and was told 3min. I waited another 10min and inquired again, finally the meal was brought out with no apology. When I inquired why i had waited so long they said they were busy. The restaurant was not any more busy than previously and the staff really did not seem to care at all.I will not be returning to such poor service and lack of effort thereafter

The Summer Special Menu featuring "Real Shaved Truffle" on Sushi & Sashimi is all worth it 1st time to have Sushi with truffle and loved the experience. The ChuToro Sashimi special offer is also part of the summer menu. Healthy & Yummy. I wish this menu can be offered year long.

We had lunch here today for the first time at this store, but not first time at this chain. We like the train which they did have but the chairs were too low to see the dishes going past on the conveyor. Had to stand up to look and select. Variety of train dishes limited to fish and seafood. Did not see Katsu Chicken, had to ask specifically for Avocado. Also ordered Udon soup. While tasty it would be absolutely fabulous if they offered a Seafood Udon and put in prawns, mussels, fish, calamari and raw egg, plus a few more vegetables like carrot, mushroom and bok choy. By all means charge more, but this would have a distinct advantage from being just another udon soup. No serviettes provided, just wet towels for after the meal. It wasn't cheap but it was nice

I advise all to skip their visit to Ngee Ann City Sushi Tei. The food itself is mediocre, and we had to wait one and a half hours just to eat chicken curry rice. Moreover, we had to remind the staff six times regarding our order as they had ordered chicken teriyaki by mistake. We will definitely not be coming here again
3
Big menu, average food, average price- great for a quick mid-shop lunch. We had sushi, a roll, and Katsu. All were decent
4
Regular visitors to this chain with family. Always busy and price is fair and reasonable. Locations usually easy to access. Worth a visit and service quality good. Food quality also decent.

This place has fine sushi with affordable price. One thing I'd like to feed back to The chef is that, It's good to have your nigiri in one strong piece while I pick it up to eat with my chopstick, but please, don't compress the rice too hard, the nigiri should be able to melt easily while it's in the mouth. The fish is great, I'm quite impressed with the quality. Please put a little wasabi under the fish before combine the rice and fish together, this will help bring the taste up.

~on the upper floors of Ngee Ann City nearby the escalators is nestled Sushi Tei's restaurant, great for a late lunch with family. After a very short queue, we managed to get a table for 4 even though it was fullChawanmushi - piping hot and goodYasai Miso Soup - okPork Tsukune Yaki - mehChasyu Don - YUMzTonkotsu Ramen - Very GoodSalmon Sashimi - Always Fresh~Will be Back

if you want to eat sushi in the nge ann city area, you should come here. Because the sushi is nice and fresh. Until now I have a difficulty to find a good sushi in Singapore. So when I want to eat sushi, I just go to this place. Really nice plac
3
This is the 2nd time I visited this place unfortunately one thing that I was looking forward too was no longer in their menu: salmon skin fried.The rest of the menu are standard sushi tei. Seafood are fresh. Sushi also freshly rolled. In general, food and service was okay
4
Sushi is generally decent and consistent across most outlets but I like their cooked items better. They surprisingly make good cold noodles with chewy texture with sesame sauce. Do give the eel hitsumabushi a try as the light broth provided gives the rice and eel a rich flavour to every bite.Folks who enjoy eating at this place regularly should consider being a member as they can get up to 20% off birthday month and e-vouchers worth more than the membership paid

We were staying in a hotel in Singapore and the Japanese restaurant was crazy priced. Went here and it was about 2/3 cheaper! Food was good, speed of delivery was amazing (we had all our food in 20 minutes!), we had not wait for table. Would definitely go again

I simply love Sushi Tei! I have been twice to Singapore and at each visit I stayed there for 3 months. Luckily, there was one Sushi Tei at Ngee Ann City, where my office was located. So, I had plenty of time to try most of their dishes. Everything was delicious! I loved their sushi rolls, the soup, the salmon teriyak, the maki rolls, etc. The price was good for the excellent quality of the food. The staff was friendly, they always had a smile on their faces. The place is always packed and one inconvenient, at least in my opinion, is that they do not stay open till late. I think they close at 9pm during the week. I love so much this restaurant that I have tried to find it here in the US, but it appears that the location in NY was closed. I can not wait to be back to Singapore and go to Sushi Tei again and again

Ahhh to enjoy the wonders of Japanese tastes.... Especially enjoyed he sashimi was absolutely beautiful.... All the over from soft shell crab wrap totally awesome food... Look forward to my next time in.üëçüëçüëç

My son and I enjoyed our dinner so much we went there twice. The menu is large and a large variety of sushi. Probably rates as some of the nicest sushi I have eaten.
4
Ive ate a lot of maki and sushi here. The choices of their carousel is good. Be back for more next time.
4
Most reliable among the mid-price Japanese eateries in Singapore. Wide-ranging options, and quality is good throughout. Good membership deal, you gain even if you eat here only once! Calmer atmosphere since they moved to the 5th floor.
5
The food is good and the price is reasonable. Average bill for 2 is around $70-$80 which is affordable. I love the amaebi and salmon belly soup.
5
Good:
-Has a cosy atmosphere.
-Staff are not hurried.
-Convenient on the 5th floor, you can park your car 1 floor above.
Bad:
-Carpark is expensive.
-Limited tables, maybe a long queue.
-Do not accept reservations.

Sushi Tei is my usual to go to place for Sushi and Sashimi. I dont think I have ever tried anything on the menu beyond sushi, sashimi and sake. I am quite picky on the freshness of sushi and and sashimi and hence my liking of this chain, especially the ngee ann city outlet. Its not exactly comfort food but to me it is. The service is impeccable and the quality of items is consistent which make every trip a delightful experienc

Sushi Tei has been a regular spot for me over the last three years. It offers terrific value with quality food that's reliable, consistent, and just good. I'm amazed that the quality hasn't faltered and stays consistent across the different locations. I recall only one noticeable price hike in the last few years, however, prices are still very competitive compared to other mid-tiered Japanese spots. The Sushi Tei membership card also offers one of the best deals around! I think it's around $90 to sign up, but you receive $100 restaurant credit,10% off every meal, and points that you can redeem for even more credit. Renewals are even more valuable at just $40. Definitely great value here in Singapore. I remain a loyal customer

Most reliable among the mid-price Japanese eateries in Singapore. Wide-ranging options (from sushi/sashimi to cooked food), and quality is good throughout. Don't order the more 'expensive' items here (otoro, uni, ankimo, etc) - they're not as fresh, just wait until you go to the high-end sushi restaurants. Good membership deal - they give you vouchers with value exceeding the annual membership fee, so you gain even if you eat here only once; hen you get 10% discount (more during birthday month). Calmer atmosphere since they moved to the 5th floor

Dropped in for lunch- sushi carousel.Flavors were good- sushi rice average.Fish & seafood freshness was above repproach- Singapore quality.Service not overly friendly - these people turn tables- its clearly a volume business.Staff wont focus on you- but when you ask for something, they do it quickly and efficiently.Open and well lit spaces makes for a bustling and high energy meal.Would return & recommend for lunch if you dont want to eat too fatty a cuisine

Lo yu sheng in a Japanese restaurant with colleagues.
Yu sheng with salmon was good.
Will return again.
5
Sushi Tei's sushi is the best in Singapore! Fresh with decent price. I prefer a la carte menu anyway
4
this outlet in Ngee Ann City is not that easy to find. once sitted, you will enjoy the ambience and the food quality is consistent with other Sushi Teh outlets. i love the sashimi, handrolls, maki, ramen and the tempura. Sushi Teh does not disappoint.
4
The food was alright. I do find it a tad expensive. The restaurant does have a decent amount of variety of dishes to choose. So, overall, I would go back again but not too often.
5
One of the best family Japanese food outlet that always on my prefer list. Serve wide selection as food with good quality and fresh.
4
Would go back - convenient location and quality reliable. Fish almost always fresh.
3
Standard run of the mill sushi
5
we eat as much as we could tried almost everythingsushi rolls (tuna, salmon), tempura, soup....very good food at an unbelievable price.lots of people (locals, tourists) though, the ambience is cheap looking (you cannot have it all...)really convenient location after shopping.friendly and nice service
2
Service staff will not hesitate to discourage and turn away patrons who have no prior bookings. Not a friendly place and the food is not fantastic enough for me to put up with such bad service. They might as well close it if they are not happy to do busines
3
Among the few available "Kaiten Sushi", or the Sushi on the plate on belt conveyor restaurant in Singapore, I would give them slightly above the standard. Being a Japanese native living in Singapore for a while, I find it hard to find the real quality Sushi restaurant in this category, but I would credit them for keeping above average acceptable standard. ( I have to say that there are many questionable restaurant in this category even in Singapore)

Same old same old

i like the sashimi salad with the house dressing and the salmon skin spicy roll.

Typical jap food.. quite exp.

Quite a cramp restaurant compare to other outlets, service a bit slow, will prefer other outlet at Vivo, Paragon and Raffles Place.

the ikura sake sushi is yum.
5
now this is a real good japanese restaurant. must try the sashimi salad(drool) and the dragon roll(double drool). and the kaisen kaminabe also.... thinking of the food makes me want to go out now(at 1:35 am) and eat there.

Food not bad but service a bit slow
