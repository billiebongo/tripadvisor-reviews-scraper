Ordered the set dinner and was amazed with the presentation of food and quality. Very creative mix of ingredients and there was introduction of each dish. Perfect!
4
Shima has been around for the longest time. And being in Goodwood Hotel adds to the Restaurant's charm.
Food is expensive or it'll be a perfect place to dine. They should offer value meals during off peak
3
service wasn't great. was seated at the teppanyaki counter. the food we ordered was not cooked in front of us at the teppanyaki counter instead at the counter beside. it kind of defeated the purpose of the whole teppanyaki experience.
5
Great value for money for a teppanyaki buffet lunch. Food was fresh and well seasoned. Ambience is good too.
3
Food is good as usual. But the wait between dishes is longer than expected. The table next to us was also too rowdy for us to enjoy our dinner.
5
Had Teppanyaki buffet lunch. This is not the first time i dine here. Whenever i want a good Teppanyaki meal I will be this restaurant
5
Service was good and waiter was attentive. Food was great and fantastic. Quiet and nice ambience well suited for a relax dining and small talks.
4
Best teppanaki enjoyed in Singapore
Top quality food in comfortable surroundings, with friendly and efficient staff
4
Lots of food to eat! The oysters, prawns & beef were very well grilled. while the chicken & vegetables were very ordinary. We had Chef Michael Ho at the Teppanyaki stove cooking for us. He was patient & attentive. The parking at Goodwood is exhorbitant ..... it cost us $17.50! .... hope we can get complimentary parking in future.Most of the staff were very helpful
4
Very nice teppanyaki. The beef is really soft. Service is great too. The only down side is the smell that lingers on our clothes & hair. My phone is became a little oily. If they could upgrade their kitchen exhaust & hood, Iâ€™ll defintely visit as often as possible.
5
The presentation and taste of the dishes were immaculate and very delightful! Thumbs up for the effort by the chef in making the visually stunning meal.
5
They open punctually at 12 noon and the service was good
The food portion was just nice and it was a great afternoon meal with fruits as dessert
4
Very good service and food. Will recommend friends to come, have been here for 4 times since being recommended by my friend
3
Used to come to this restaurant when young. Now realized why I do not come, good food but so so expansive! Can get better value at other restaurants
4
Nice and wonderful ambience plus nice food too... though the price is on the steep side but the food is good and worth the price!!! Not forgetting the friendly chef who served us on that night. Thumbs up for his service! Highly recommended restaurant!!!
4
Food variety was wide and value for money. Prawns were a little harder to chew, not so springy as the last time we visited. Beef was cooked to perfection. The only pity is they have changed the ice cream from matcha to vanilla.
4
Great food! Absolute value-for-money. A la carte buffet lunch came with dessert which was vanilla ice-cream and there were no other options.

I googled the top teppanyaki restaurants in Singapore and remembered Shima which was also mentioned in the list from my web search. I went there with high expectations after reading the reviews. I was also pleased to note that there was s one for one for American Express Platinum card and my companion and I chose the $280++ Menu which included king prawn, wagyu beef and foie grois. I waited with anticipation. But was sorely disappointed by an indifferent chef, lackadaisical cooking and frankly overly oily food. The scallops were oily and when placed in front of me sat in a pool of oil. It was distasteful. The beef was unevenly cooked although I had asked for medium rare. The fried rice was salty. The vegetables were super soggy. As it was a weekday the restaurant was not crowded. But the wait staff spoke loudly and had no regard for the customers. The atmosphere was one of a lack of class and it was disappointing. After tax I paid $330 per pax. Super expensive with low class atmosphere and disappointing cook.

Went here for my wifeâ€™s birthday and had the Kaeseki. After having the authentic one in Japan it was always going to be a stretch to match it but unfortunately this fell far below expectations. Staff had no idea what was on the menu or what was being served and had to go ask the Chef several times. Also the staff were too fussy, continually around the table lifting things, cleaning, refilling etc- not like Japan where they are in the background. Food was average, Tempura very oily, several courses tasteless. Would not go bac
4
It's been years since I last was at Shima and the renewal of acquaintance with this restaurant did not disappoint. They had a good variety of teppanyaki sets and three selections of kaiseki - we didnt have room fod the kaiseki though. The a la carte menu did not disappoint either, with the sashimi set being fresh (even though we went on a Sun) and artfully presented
5
Always enjoyed the teppanyaki dinner here at Shima. Fresh ingredients. Must try - salmon with shima sauce. Love the way they do the salmon. Don’t forget the flambé beef, ask for medium doneness. Certainly an excellent dining place for teppanyaki. Great service too.
5
I enjoyed the Chirashi Don set lunch prepared by Japanese Chef. Especially enjoyed the salad and chawanmushi. Great service experience too. Hope to visit again soon to try the teppanyaki buffet.
Highly recommended restaurant near Orchard mrt for quality Japanese food.
5
Chefs put a good performance for cooking. Food was equally great as well. Beef tenderloin was superb and delicious.
5
Food there was really fresh that they didn't need to cook it with much seasonings etc. Chef was really fun as he kept talking to us and joking with us. Would definitely go again!
5
Quality of food remains, chef is very interactive throughout the session too. Always love visiting them when i have the crave for teppanyaki, always been my favorite.
5
We went there for my wife's birthday dinner. We had Tepan Wagyu and filet with vegetables. The food was world class. The service was impeccable. Great experience. Expensive, but worth it.
5
We returned to one of our favorite lunch places. The quality of the food was excellent and we felt that the service was really good, too. What was new to us this time was the enhanced show effect of the Chef by pouring a special oil on the table. We thought it was only to impress a young girl sitting at the same table but it was repeated at all the tables. It generates a lot of heat but surely looks spectacular. Not sure though that everybody likes it.

Looking back into my formative years, my parents were huge fans of Shima and regularly brought me there to stuff my face with grilled Japanese delights. I recall my little self rejoicing whenever my father announced that Shima was where we were going to have lunch.Fast forward to today, I (minus all trace of adorable traits from my youth) am still a huge fan of the place and persist in recommending it to my peers.At an approximate S$60 for lunch, one is able to enjoy an unlimited supply of teppanyaki style cooked beef tenderloin and massive oysters; not to mention the surgically cut salmon sashimi and yummy ebi tempura to boot. With the ever rising food prices in Singapore; this to me, is a steal.Being a huge fan since from a young age, I have occasionally toyed with the idea that nostalgia might have contributed some bias to my continued appreciation for Shima. However, this doubt has been swiftly debunked as even the most fastidious of friends of whom I have dined there with, left with nothing but praise for the age old establishment. Shima was and is still the go to place for a good Teppanyaki experience. Having been stuffing the faces of so many generations, I would dare say that it is one of Singapore's legendary gastronomical icons
5
Have been here for a few times. Last time is 2 years ago.. The standard for their teppanyaki is still as good as before.. really enjoy the food and customer service from the chef who is serving us.. will recommend anyone who loves good teppanyaki and service
4
We made a last minute dinner reservation and was glad that the dinner crowd had dispersed by the time we arrived. Ordered the set dinners and sat at the teppanyaki counter. The lobster was fresh and steak was good. Chef was attentive and friendly and service was generally prompt and sharp. We enjoyed the dinner experience and will return again.
4
Grand old dame that has been renovated in recent years dishes up quality Japanese food. Great for gatherings as there is something for everyone. The staff was very understanding and accommodating as we have an infant in our group.
4
Teppanyaki buffet was great value and has variety of choices! Ambience was good too. Great service!!
5
went w my boss, so she paid $130 for 2 pax, free flow of sashimi, teppanyaki beef, chicken, osyter, etc , ends w vanilla ice cream, yummy if not for the price!
2
The standard of food have been dropping year after year.
I would rather they increase the price and maintain the quality and standard of food served.
If you are in a Budget and want Japanese food, you can come here.
4
Very good value for lunch. Juicy beef, plump oysters and fresh prawns. A small request - allow seconds for dessert and include coffee!
4
Standard has dropped over the years but overall still above average for its Teppanyaki. Will definitely visit again.
5
Excellent value set lunch consists of sashimi & sushi, tempura, oyster, salmon, chicken, prawn, steak & vegetables cooked on temppanyaki hot plate. Excellent value!
5
Great fresh and generous produce with chefs and staff that know the product. Will definitely come back again. Chef gave us a heads up before he light up the flame as he knew we would want to video it and showed variety to the dining party next to us.

I went on the weekend for the Teppanyaki buffet, of which the Chope vouchers are applicable. The support crew serving is extremely helpful and friendly, and they bothered to briefly explain the dishes and the condiments without being overly imposing. They were also very prompt and responsive to secretly clear the dishes, and provide more warm tea. The chefs at the teppanyaki counters are also very experienced. The entire course was cooked almost to perfection. Loved the squid, oysters and beef that's medium rare- still juicy, tender, easy to bite (not accidentally dripping with blood like some other places that might be less experiences). The food is seasoned well, and very fresh. My family loved it. Overall, a comfortable teppanyaki place, with delicious food
4
We went for the buffet set at $49.90/pax. This starts with salmon sashimi starters and a piece of sushi. After that came the prawn and fish tempura. Then came all the teppan yaki buffet meats and vegetables which included oysters, chicken, salmon belly, beef, prawns and mixed vegetables. A bowl of garlic rice also accompanied the meal. For dessert, there was ice cream. Japanese tea is extra and charged at $4/pax (free flow). The food was well cooked and the chef was friendly and informative. This is good value for money teppan yaki. With the Chope voucher, we got an additional 10% off the $100. My only gripe is that the area around the teppan yaki tables isn't bright. The low lighting and dark furniture gives it a gloomy look
5
Good atmosphere, good and value for money. A great place for young children to experience teppanyaki dining for the first time.
2
Booked a table for four and they wanted us to squeeze into a space for three persons. Ventilation was very bad. Tea was not topped up promptly, had to request several times. Quite disappointing experience, not the shima we used to know.
4
Service is great as always, but frankly speaking food quality (especially the ready eats) is no longer on par compare to its glory days. Regardless so, it will still be my favorite place to go to for a great teppanyaki.
2
This place have dropped ! From a high end restaurant to a fast food standard.
The food and service here is below average now. Skip !
4
Very good food in pleasant surroundings. Servers pleasant. Promotional offers make it affordable but expect to pay on the higher priced end.
3
This is my first time at Shima. I enjoyed the fresh seafood, the lovely beef and the generous portions. It was definitely a lunch that made me very full. A bit of mixed feelings about the place so unsure if I will be back.
4
We went to Shima for our last night in Singapore and have been delighted by the food and the very good service. We love teppanyaki and have been in many around the world, this one is definitely above par. It focuses on the essential, the food i.e. no big show, very good meat and accurate cooking. We had the menu with ribeye, the meat quality was excellent, (I was surprised when reading some reviews stating otherwise) veg, shrimps and rice too. The only thing I would improve was the pace of cooking which was to fast to my liking.Otherwise service was great, especially with the kids! The cook was always mindful of them asking if they wanted to taste any of the dish and the waiter was also very attentive.Sure it's not cheap but I found the price acceptable given the quality and quantity.I would definitely go back for a good evening eat out
5
Whether it be business guests or family or friends, Shima is always a hit. Great value for money for the lunch teppanyaki, on TOP of the great quality of the food and excellent taste. Very consistent as well, since we have been dining here for years. The beef, shrimp and garlic rice are fantastic, and definitely worth stuffing yourself for a repeat serving.
2
I had such fond memories of this place growing up and so had high expectations for my wife's dinner celebrations. When we got to the place, we had to wait for some time as there was no one to show us to our seats even though the restaurant was hardly full. When someone finally did, he showed us to our table and then left without checking that one chair was missing.The menu had little in the way for children which we were not told during the reservation when we mentioned we had two children. We eventually ordered from the a la carte menu for them while we ordered the sets. The staff who brought us the food couldn't agree with her other colleague if we were being ordered sharksfin or sting ray. Service was careless. The courses in the set came together rather than one after another. They insisted on serving me first rather than my wife even after I suggested it to them. The serving staff simply handed the plate to my wife rather than placing it down. Food was nothing to crow about. For a Japanese restaurant that prides itself as the oldest in Singapore on its website, perhaps an update to its service is required to maintain its longevity
2
We were craving for Teppanyaki and visited Shima at Goodwood Park. It is a high end restaurant where the everything was pricey. The meat selection was costly and we had to limit our options. The service was ok but I felt that the chef who did the cooking in front of us could have been more friendly. My children were overly conscious of the cost and refrained from having an hearty meal. Additionally the mood in the restaurant was rather rigid and cold
3
There are two Japanese restaurants at the Goodwood. This is the more traditional of the two.
The service is unusually friendly and attentive. The sashimi fresh and well presented. Everything is fine.
Except the bill, which is, frankly, silly.
1
Went for a special couple night out. Unfortunately the food was average with fruit not freshly prepared. Service was also average and very rushed. Probably the worst Japanese restaurant we've ever been to.
5
We eat here whenever we want to give ourselves a special treat. The teppanyaki here is up to Japanese standards. It's not cheap, but it's worth it.
4
Brilliant Teppanyaki. All the food was above average and the service was friendly and efficient.
Kobe beef, salmon belly, grilled prawns, scallops, mushrooms and garlic rice,w ashed with a chilled Sake.
1
To start with , I had a credit card offer which promised me a one for one and it was with great expectation that I visited Shima which is nestled in a upmarket part of the city. To those who know their Teppanyaki, the teppanyaki buffet here is an eyewash. There is no sauce preparation on the pan , the eye catching blaze that is set etc, the kind that is associated with Teppanyaki. When I asked, I was told that it would be very expensive and this is all that I can get within the price. ( Yeah..that is a real classy answer Shima).Then the beef which I asked medium rare, was so hopeless that in most countries , they probably use gloves and bury this 6 feet under ground and cover it with concrete. It was simply tasteless. To sum up, there was absolutely no Teppanyaki in the teppanyaki buffet and the quality of produce was quite tragic. To add insult to injury, I was charged for 2 green teas, which I had never ordered and the credit card 1 for 1 "is not valid for the buffet Sir" was the curt answer that I got despite there being no such mention on their website. The only silver lining is that the portions were a lot but when there is simply no flavour, the portions do not matter. An extremely hopeless place and definitely give the buffet a miss
3
It is a traditional japanese restaurant with teppanyaki stations. We had a premium teppanyaki for 1-for-1 ($280 per pax) with sashimi, wayu beef, foie gras, prawns, fish, garlic rice, scallop. The food was well presented and cooked. The service was also prompt. The only incident that made my dinner not as enjoyable was finding a bone in the sashimi. After feedback to the waitress/kitchen, instead of a sincere apology, I was given a defensive explanation on how it could have happened. I just wanted to alert the kitchen so that they can be more careful in future, as having a bone in a sashimi is a great no-no for such a fine restaurant. So, I was quite turned off by the explanation. At the end of the dinner, It did not help that even the floor manager tried to explain defensively when I mentioned about the bone when he asked for my feedback on the dinner. What made all of these even worse was, as an after-thought, the floor manager asked if he could offer us ice-cream. I felt that they were just not trained on how to react for such situations. Had a similar incident in another fine restaurant (rope in beef). Waiter alerted floor manager who came to apologise. Our dessert was upgraded as a pleasant surprise.I am unlikely to visit Shima again.

Went with my sister and family for a birthday celebration. The buffet is decently priced and menu is acceptable with sashimi and teppanyaki options. It is about 60 sgd per pax. Started off with all items on the menu. The sashimi is nice and fresh and the tempura are well battered and fried. Cleanliness is generally good but my sister pulled out a very long strand of hair from her fried veggie. The manager dismissed it as a common issue and the chef said it must have been the hair from the source - not from their staff. And they offered free green tea for all (... like seriously?!...)The management should just admit that this is not acceptable and hoping that it doesn't mar our experience and make some better service recovery. He ended up not charging my nephew who is 6 years old. Dessert is pretty disappointing. Overall, not a wow experience, small seating space. And staff actually commented that one of us ate alot (i don't mean to be rude, but why are they monitoring and commenting on how much someone is eating....do your job well first.. right?
5
Been wanting to try this place for awhile . Glad I finally did. The staff is warm and friendly.. Restaurant manager Roland is a fantastic host... Making sure we are happy with our orders. Food is not bad. Mikuni will be slightly better for the prawns with their signature mayo sauce. But Shima definitely serves up good value..Will recommend this to anyone looking to try a new place.

Ever since the popular old school hilltop teppanyaki closed its doors, we went in search of another yummy one we could go to when the craving hits. Well, we found one now! Altho' most would agree the lunch buffets would make it more wallet friendly.It is free flow alacarte buffet~ (mind you, drinks are not on the buffet). We enjoyed the salmon sashimi and prawn tempura served as starters and the 1st round of teppanyaki was great.. oysters, cubes of beef, butter prawns, teriyaki chicken, salmon! My fav was the butter prawns.. tasty! I think the garlic fried rice could be better.. and then the service abit improvements too (altho the chef was the nicest ever. friendly young chap who cooked well and was abit entertaining too! hehe)All in all, a nice experience! would recommend it esp the lunch buffet and if you stay in orchard for your vacation ;)

I visit this restaurant because my friend got 200 SGD voucher. When we reach there at 19:30 hrs. got a lot of staff but only 1 table of customer sit. They push us to sit in front of the pan, so we can order tepanyaki set. The korean staff talk to my friend and she try to recommend us beef because it's her job to recommend expensive menu. The point is I can't eat beef, so my friends and I discuss about it quite a while. suddenly the manager approached us and speak very loudly "you can't only order exactly amount of 200!!! you have to order more and pay some!!!! 1 set is a bit only, share not enough!!!" OMG! I never seen this kind of rude service before. what he act was really rude and unacceptable service!, how dare you look down the people? We don't care about money at all but we just don't know how big of the portion due to the menu never mention details. Afterthat we ordered 2 sets, oyster and chicken set. the food taste nice but over priced. 1 set got a plate of sashimi, 1 plate of tempura (4 pcs), 1 pcs of cooked salmon and prawn, 1 small bowl of garlic rice (no taste), 1 small plate of fried veg and a small plate of fruit. After we finished the meal the manager served us miso soup and he said sorry ah it's for free. He really ruined all our whole meal already, so we don't bother to eat his miso soup anymore. Total amount of 2 sets was almost 240 SGD.
1
Maybe because we were late, but this visit was disappointing. Oldfashioned and pathetic personnel. The food was reasionable but far to expensive. Simple sushi required debate between three men in the kitchen.
It had his best days.
Never again.
4
Overall the food was excellent. I ordered the hibachi combo with steak and seafood, and the service was very attentive and the food was fresh and well-prepared. I also had some sashimi which was absolutely top quality. My only complaint was that the garlic rice and some of the other sides were VERY heavy on garlic. If I eat there again, I would ask them to go easy on the garlic, and then the meal would definitely be a perfect 5-star score
4
Delicious Sashimi, very fresh and well presented, I had the Deluxe Set, it came with Miso Soup, tempura shrimp, and a couple of vegetables. It also came with two scallops, one tiger prawn, garlic rice, and vegetables. You can chose your main course from a selection of beef tenderloin, wagyu, and more Japanese beefs.The beef tenderloin was very good.I also tried the chicken with teriyaki sauce and the maki was very nice.Service was better than expected.The only thing I don't like it was a bit smokey, they should improve their ventilation
3
Last time I was there was 20 years ago as a teenager, wanted to treat my family to what I always remembers as a special occasion. What I got instead was a disappointing surprise. We were party of 4 and all got the Shima Delux set menu with beef tenderloin (SGD 110 / person). Starting with the food quality / taste: sashimi was fresh & tasty. Tempura was mediocre consisting of 2 prawns and 2 slices of vegetables. Scallops were tasty and juicy. Garlic rice tasted bland. Beef was nothing special. Service: polite but completely lacked enthusiasm, had the impression that they were looking forward to going home. Cleanliness: place was clean however did not appreciate the fact that the only thought about wiping the table just as we got up to eat dessert, meaning we arrived to a completely damp table to eat dessert. Food was delivered too quick and forget getting any show from the tempanyaki chef. Price/. SGD 560 was well over prices for what we got. Really unfortunate to say but it will be my last visit
1
We went to Shima for Amex card promotion, it's $280 per person but the value we had for this price is way disappointing. It started with a few small sashimi, then followed by 4 pieces the tempura. It's fresh fried but doesn't taste soft and crispy. Garlic rice doesn't have butter and garlic favor, more importantly, they serve in very portion, mail course is beff, they were cut in dize size less than 8 pieces. What we had doesn't match their description on their menu. In addition, Being a high end restaurant, you can see kids running around in the restaurant and the waiters fingers were sticking in your food when the food is delivered.Definitely will never go back again.

My wife and I love quality teppanyaki food so much that we decided to walk into Shima Japanese Teppanyaki Restaurant at Goodwood Park Hotel on a Sunday in September 2015 for the popular all-you-can-eat lunch buffet without making any table reservation. Teppanyaki remains the signature cuisine of Shima today since 1980. Shima was also one of the first teppanyaki restaurants in Singapore and was well-known for its time-honoured recipes that were passed down from the early Japanese master chefs. Many other teppanyaki restaurants had closed down, including the popular scenic hill top Japanese restaurant located at Jurong Bird Park on Jurong Hill. Whenever we are craving for teppanyaki, we think of Shima.As we did not make any prior booking for the teppanyaki buffet, we did not get to sit around any of the large teppanyaki tables to see the culinary skills of Shima’s chefs performing right before our eyes. I guessed it was also good for not getting the direct heat from the teppanyaki griddles. More so when we didn’t get the smoky and greasy smell on our clothing later.Soon, we settled down for their popular weekend teppanyaki buffet lunch, which comes with free flow of salmon sashimi, prawn tempura, shisamo tempura, makimono, chef’s special, assorted meats, seafood, vegetables, garlic rice, miso soup and dessert. While the chefs were busily taking great pride to show their culinary skills at the respective teppanyaki griddles, we indulged in an array of delicious dishes freshly prepared and served piping hot onto our plates away from the enervating heat. The condiment of their special Goma sauce and fragrant garlic dipping sauce enhanced the flavour of the gorgeous food and pampered our eating pleasure through this prefecture. We were told that besides offering top-notch produce such as fresh Hokkaido oysters, poached salmon, beef tenderloin and tiger prawns, their chefs also painstakingly make most of the accompanying sauces in-house. Shima’s flavoursome teriyaki sauce is used to coat the tender pieces of chicken thigh cooked on griddle to give a deep fragrant taste with liberal amount of sesame seeds.. The fresh and thickly sliced salmon sashimi was a delight when it was well paired with the wasabi paste as an accompaniment to satisfy our mouths with a sharply penetrating pungent sensation in our noses. Pan-fried prawns in teriyaki sauce and garlic were yummy. Norwegian salmon was gently simmered on a thin aluminium foil containers, placed on the griddle with Shima’s secret sauce until it was cooked to a silky perfection before the waitress brought them to our table. Shima’s crispy prawn tempura was absolutely divine with a special flavoured dip. Small cubes of premium beef cooked to medium-rare preference were tender and scrumptious, which was sourced from the best farms in Japan and America. For the lunch buffet, the chef said that Australian tenderloin is usually served. Pieces of chicken cooked with Teriyaki sauce on griddle came fresh, juicy and tender with every bite. The well-toasted huge Hokkaido oysters came with a little brownish crisp on the outside and juicy on the inside, which were delectable in strong garlic flavour. Teppanyaki vegetables were chopped and gently pan-fried over the evenly heated griddle in a traditional assortment of bean sprouts with small slices of mushrooms, shredded carrots and lettuce till steaming hot for serving. A little oily and crunchy but delicious! We loved the slightly charred garlic fried rice which was prepared with a liberal amount of garlic, egg and wagyu beef fat to give a fragrant and satisfying end to the entire teppanyaki course. If we were not a garlic rice fan, we would skip the rice and went for more palatable items such as salmon sashimi, prawn tempura or oysters.Of course, there was also thick and smooth ice creams as well as juicy fruits for dessert. They surely helped in our digestion while we took a short break at the same cosy area before re-ordering our favourite dishes to end our entire meal. The modern dining environment was generally very good and conducive. We liked the relaxed ambience of the restaurant. Customer service level was well above average. The only thing we disliked most was the basic drinks which were not included in the menu. Not even plain water! We ended up paying for our green tea to quench our thirst. This item should have been included in the menu for the convenience and pleasure of the customers at negligible cost.My review, however, finds that the teppanyaki lunch buffets are really value for money. The prices are:-• $49.90++/pax on weekdays• $59.90++/pax on weekends and public holidays (with a few additional dishes)Shima’s teppanyaki buffets allow you to order from the menu items as much as you like. Free flow of the menu items for as much as you can eat! Where else can you find a sumptuous teppanyaki buffet meal at such an amazing value?Both my wife and I like the teppanyaki buffet menu at Shima and surely we would love to make a return visit to enjoy good value teppanyaki buffet lunch again soon.In case you are still wondering which restaurant to go for teppanyaki buffet lunch, try Shima. They also have their ala carte dinner menu if you are not a great eater but a little picky type
1
Absolutely awful service and restaurant. Waiter taking order was unhelpful and constantly tried to push expensive items from menu. Portions were small and fried rice was tasteless. Beef was ok but meal left most hungry. Had 4 bottles of wine which they then ran out of and they offered alternative which I only realised after was 50% more expensive. Only interested in taking max money from customers for awful overall experience
4
Went for the lunch buffet on a weekend. Got a table seat which I feel is better since more space. Food was generally great except i thought the stir fried veggies were pretty just average. Was surprise we have to pay extra for normal drinks like hot/ice green tea and it weren't included in the buffet price. Service by the staffs and even the chefs are really good!! They are really attentive and response to request pretty fast
2
Their standard, and service have drop. Have been a regular customer for their lunch buffet before the renovation. Try to make a reservation, and call almost 10 times, but no one answer the phone. Finally just left a voice mail, and reserve it. Went there at 12 noon, and the service manager was very rude. Anyway, they still got a table for 2 of us, me and my son. We have their buffet which cost $59.90 per person. The teppanyaki salmon, and cuttle fish was nice. Other than that, the rest of the food is very normal. It is just not worth it, and you have to endure the service manager bad service and looks
4
After reading a number of negative reviews on Tripadvisor I very nearly cancelled our reservation. Luckily we didn't and thoroughly enjoyed the experience and food. Very busy with tables turning over regularly. Evening menu for 2 $250 + drinks. Aussie Wagyu excellent. There is also a nice looking Japanese restaurant named Tatsuya ( not to be confused with Sydney restaurant Tetsuya) which was busy and fun looking - not Teppanyaki - will try next visit.
1
Wanted to book Sunday lunch (4days in advance) was told plenty of tables when I requested for 7 pax.....only to call 5 mins later after confirming with family members ...that there is only 1 table for 4 available....if this is the image they create, I will not be trying again...

Its been years since our last visit here. Came here for lunch for its promximity to Orchard road which is just 5 mins down the slope. The decor is simple but evokes a traditional japanese ambience. We ordered a few dishes of sushi and sashimi to start based on the seasonal catch recommendation by the friendly waitress along with our usual favourite of tuna and salmon sashimi and tempura. Although we were supposed to behere just for a quick lunch , ended up staying longer so that we could enjoy the food and the ambience. We were happy that the restaurant still maintains the same good service, food quality, taste and service after all these years. It still reminded as good as we have remembered from our previous visits here years ago. The staff is as they have always been, ever so friendly and charming. Will come back again soon for dinner to have the teppanyaki
1
The chef did no showmanship at all. Hardly acknowledged us and didn't check our order. No cutting, chopping, or any style at all. Unceremoniously dropped and onion on the grill as the grand start to our lack luster dinner. The used to be the top teppanyaki in Singapore. No longer. Very expensive. We got dressed up only to find we were dining in the basement. Decor is old tired and a little grimy, and kind of truck stop decor. The service staff were so efficient that we felt rushed and a little overwhelmed by how many there were, barely placed a utensil down and food whisked away. Have eaten teppanyaki all over the world. This was very very soulless and lacked the atmosphere. Would not return.

Shima Restaurant serving Japanese food has been around for many years at the site of Goodwood Park Hotel on Scotts Road. Had lunch there today, after 8 years. It has not lost its charm and good quality Japanese teppanyaki food. We had the buffet which had appetizers such as salmon sashimi, California roll and tempura. Fresh and delicious. The main meats of salmon, wagyu beef and chicken were outstanding. The chicken and beef were tender and so well marinated, cooked to perfection. The salmon was amazing too. It is worth every bit of the $45.90 per adult we paid. Excellent service

We dined at Shima on the recommendation of our hotel (we'd asked for a tip for a good teppanyaki) but our experience fell significantly short of the apparent experiences of other diners who've reviewed this venue. It was a quiet mid-week night - around 8pm, restaurant just less than half full - but apart from a good sushi & tempura, the teppanyaki part of the meal was bland, greasy and disappointing (an additional shame as it wasn't the cheapest steak cut either). Also, even though the restaurant was less than half full, we were still initially stuck in a corner next to the teppanyaki grill and next to a large air conditioning unit! Staff were pleasant enough, if a little too attentive (seemed exceedingly keen to make us finish off the sake as quickly as possible). And on top of all this, our Shima experience then produced the 2nd highest bill of our trip to Singapore...the one venue that did cost more was 1000x better in terms of food and experience. Doubt we'll be going back - there's so much else to choose from in Singapore

...and that makes a change from most Japanese restaurants, in my opinion. The senior management staff went out of their way to suggest and recommend, and the ladies who wait were charming and sweet-natured.The food was on the upside of adequate..not a 'wow-factor', but the bill was surprisingly reasonable. I shall return regularly

My daughter and I recently visited Singapore and were fortunate to get restaurant recommendations from a prominent Singapore resident. We went to Shima Japanese restaurant. We had tempura assorted, uni, and the best sashimi I have ever had, we had extra, we tried a number of dishes, all but 1 were incredible. The one we did not like turned out to be the most popular dish, it was tuna covered in I think plantain pulp. However, that was personal preference, the food was OUTSTANDING!! The same goes for the ambiance and the service. When you are treated so well and eat so well price is of no real consequence!! Thank you SHIMA!! We would love to return some day

Shima Japanese restuarant never disappoints, it is consistently very good Teppanyaki restuarant located on Scotts Road, just off Orchard Road entertainment quarter. It always looks the same and is the real deal for reliable quality Japanese. It is quite pricey but for special occasion worth it. The Teppanyaki BBQ style is my favourite Japanese and this place fits the bill

Went for lunch because I booked it by accident - asked when I called to book if it was Tatsuya and they assured me it was, called back to change the time of my booking and again asked if it was Tatsuya and again they assured me it was! Both are Japanese restaurants located at the Goodwood Hotel but they are very different and I was disappointed from the moment we stepped in. They obviously won awards in the 1990's and it was probably very nice then but now it smells (faint whiff of pee at the table we sat at, and no, it wasn't my new perfume), decor is dusty and odd and old and sad. Ikea lampshades, very peculiar posters advertising beef and a nice bug zapper light inflicting its blue light on you while you eat.Service was fine, food was indifferent - we did not try the Teppanyaki (maybe it is amazing and at night you don't notice how jaded the place is?) but chose from the limited Bento options. Expensive for what it is - I have had better food at Ichiban Boshi for less.Accoustics were horrible where we sat and screeching office girls at another table made conversation difficult. The table next to us were having a very interesting conversation and we heard every word. My end of the meal watermelon arrived and one piece was chilled - straight out of the fridge and the other was warm - had it been out already and not been eaten by another diner? Just speculation but given the rest of the experience that was the feeling I had.Will never go back - Singapore has too many excellent dining options and there is no need to visit this one again in my opinion

I ate here with my wife and a stock broker who took us out on his account, so money was no object. We wanted someplace nice and expensive, and Shima certainly fit the latter description. We went on Sunday night (the large restaurant was deserted) and all ordered the S$260 steak and lobster set. The sashimi was good (but salmon, not tuna), the tempura was quite good, the lobster was fine (I am not a lobster fan as it is too much work to eat), but the steak was only 100gr despite being Australian. At this price they could have been a lot more generous. Furthermore, they treated small bottles of sake as if they were wine, and constantly tried to refill glasses. I think that the staff were in a rush to get us to leave so they could go home too, despite it being only 8:30pm. Overall, it was a decent Japanese restaurant, but not worth it. It is in Goodwood Park Hotel so a lot of walking was involved to get there
