We travel a lot and eat often in fine restaurants around the world . This was perfect. We had a two course lunch which was sprinkled with surprise eats and drinks to delight. Will go back. The food treated my pallet to a taste delight.
5
We went for lunch on a weekday and were offered the choice between a 2 or 3 course menu; we opted for the 3 course as we were in no rush and had lots to catch up on.As all the tables were taken, we were seated at the bar, which ended up being quite entertaining with being served our courses by the chefs who all gave a detailed rundown of what was being served at the time.Before we were served the 'starter' of the set menu we ordered, we were served half a dozen amuse bouches that were great taste explosions in our mouths. It was a good thing we were in no hurry, so we did not mind at all. After the 5th amuse I was starting to think that they had forgotten about our actual order, but of course I was mistaken.I had foie gras for starter, risotto for main (which was outstanding) and soufflé for dessert. And I would order them all again the next time, if on offer.Although we sat at the(eating) bar, the service staff always managed to step behind there in time to check on our water top ups and on whether we would like some more wine or not. Well choreographed I must say.Of course meals like this come with the expected price tag; although not cheap, when the quality of food and service is this good, there is always still value for money in there. And that is what it is all about, no matter what type of establishment you are frequenting.This was my first but not my last visit

They only offer tasting menus so you know it’s not going to be a cheap night out, but you’d be wise to avoid looking at the bill at the end of the night. Great food with some very original plates. Fabulous service. And one more thing, the food is rich so the next day you may clear the room; forewarned is forearmed.

I am surprised that Tippling Club makes it on to lists of Singapore’s best restaurants. For me, the definition of a good tasting menu is that it should be memorable afterwards. Writing this review of a so-called fine dining establishment two weeks after visiting, I can only recall one dish. The cheese course that tasted like cheese from a Kraft tube and was quite unpleasant. All of the other food was nice enough but utterly unmemorable, even by the time you get home.For a proper fine dining restaurant, the tables were too close together and the ‘90s pop music in the background too loud and intrusive. Tippling Club feels like it is trying to bridge being a bar and fine haute cuisine eatery all at once. I would respectfully suggest you can’t do both
2
Atmosphere: the interior looks nicely designed and decorated. Unfortunately, the fact that the bar and the restaurant are basically together turns the atmosphere from cool to loud. It is not about the music, but the volume and the kind. Just a weird combination.Service: generally nice and kind people served at our table. However, I counted at least 5 different people serving food. Each of them looked pretty in a rush and the description of the meal they presented was mostly incomprehensible.Food: interesting at the beginning, but getting more and more confused plate after plate. I can remember only one that was really good. One pretty bad, and the rest more well presented than pleasant. Normally, in such kind of fusion of tastes, the result should be a "wow'! Meaning that you won't imagine that the piece of food just you put in you mouth might result in such taste. Instead, the Tippling Club menu, was more "really?".Price: I don't complaint about prices. Normally it is very transparent, menu + wine + service/taxes. That said, for the amount of money spent, I am really sorry to say that it is way not worth. Moreover, it is unusual to have a menu and on top supplement for some courses. Weird...Last but not least, the day after was not great as well... giving weird stomach reactions...In a nutshell, a weird combination of bar/fine dining/unique experience. Where the unique means, not a second time

From the moment we arrived and were greeted warmly the service could not have been any better. We were with two friends and we had the tasting menu which was one fabulous dish after another. The only one that divided opinion was the strawberry cheesecake pill... I LOVED it, the others not so much. The Ice Cream bomb with Mandarin and curry was a mind blow. I can't believe I have never been here before and I will definitely be back on my next trip to Singapore
5
Went here for lunch and had quite possibly the most enjoyable meal I’ve ever had.Stunning, delicious, imaginative well thought out dishes.Showing true invention, technique and flair.Will be heading straight back here at every opportunity.Sit at the kitchen bar to see the chefs at work, very worthy of Michelin stars
5
Can't describe every course in detail but picking just the basic 3 course menu opens up many other appetizers served before your 3 course begins...There was a soup, charred food that didn't taste charred! Interesting presentations, delightful flavours, dedicated staff and chefs.There was however, a fierce lady chef who was yelling at her staff members behind the bar counter. Rather entertaining
5
This is my fourth visit to the restaurant. I loved the cocktails and how one selects the cocktails by smelling the little paper sticks given to me. Service was amazing and food was absolutely as good as they look! The christmas special tasting menu was not as good as the normal tasting menu. Wine selection was decent. Definitely recommend a visit to anyon
5
I suggest you make a reservation in advance. The food is really really nice. It can be heavy so make sure you enter with an empty tummy. I live so close by to this place and was pleasantly surprised when I discovered it after one year of being around. Simply a gem
5
Every time I bring visitors here they are blown away by the service and wonderful food. We especially love all the surprise little dishes which delight all the senses!
My husband now takes clients here as well we have been so impressed.
5
Beautifully presented food - a treat for your eyes and mouth on the nice Duxton Hill in Tanjong Pagar.
Great for lunch - for business and with friends.
5
tucked away in the museum ground and over looking the river, this restaurant offers a great selection of Singaporean and Asian classics served in a modern way. Food flavours and presentation are all on point. nice wine selection too.

I had been planning to dine here for years since Tippling Club first appeared in Asia's Best Restaurants list. Chose the Gourmand Tasting Menu with Pairing. The pairing was a mix of cocktails or wine. Read other reviews to give the pairings a miss. I should have listened. For the additional $160 for pairing, you are better off ordering by the glass. Of the pairings, only 1 is memorable; the rest did not bring any difference or connection to the dishes. As the food, the numerous snacks served were creative and interesting. I loved the Razor Clams in Garlic soup. The foie gras felt too 'oil' and 'heavy'. The cheese creation was also a miss. Overall an interesting experience of good quality food. Though nothing really memorable for a return experience
5
Went for a birthday celebration and it did not disappoint. The flavour of each dish was amazing. The generous pours of the exquisite beverages on offer by the glass were phenomenal. Then to top it off we finished with a cocktail in the bar was the icing on the cake. The gummy bear idea to choose your cocktail was so much fun. I can not wait to go back.
5
Booked lunch 2 months ago; fantastic food, service & value (S$60 3-course set lunch). Had best champaign, cocktail & house red ($18), total bill not quite US$200 for 2.Each dish artsily decorated but not overwhelming; plus compliments of finger snacks & cookies. Service most friendly from matre'd, waiter & chefs each brought dish to table explaining; we were greeted by executive head chef who invited us to kitchen to have group photo with his entire kitchen staff. Definitely MUST when visiting SGR
4
Went back after my first experience 6 months ago. They have 2 or 3 course set lunch options. We took the two course, skipping the dessert course. Was a wise decision as they had a few different types of amuse bouche. Plating was interesting and food served by the respective chefs. Reasonably priced house wines and nice. Will come back hopefully in less than 6 months time. Short taxi ride from the CBD or walk from Tg Pagar MRT station.
5
Wanted to bring my other half to this place as I had heard good things about it and just had to try it.Out of the classic and gourmand menu options, we both opted for the former and despite there being less food than the gourmand menu, there was plenty of food for both of us (& I am a big eater).To start, I ordered an Earl Grey cocktail having sniffed the perfume sticks - really tasted like Earl Grey too! Once the mains starting coming, we were served Laungostines, Scallops, Wild Halibut and Iberico Pork that was all beautifully prepared with flavours that were so diverse, there was no dominant flavour. This allowed us to get a great cross section of taste in and it was such a wonderful experience.Last but not least, the wait staff were friendly and accommodating. Their short introduction to each dish was welcome and taught us a few things about food we normally take for granted. 2 thumbs up
3
On food alone, the quality and presentation would warrant a 4 or 5 but we left disappointed because of the attitude and arrogance of the waiter.We were led to a table and my wife reacted immediately to the closeness to a wall and the servery, if I moved backwards I would hit the wall behind me.The restaurant was almost empty but when we enquired about the vacant table by the window, he immediately said it was taken.As we progressed (uncomfortably) through the meal, I kept looking at an empty table - I would loved a view of the street atmosphere - I love this part of town.About an hour and a half into the meal, I asked again about the empty table and he gave in and said we could move.So yes the food may be wonderful but for a total experience, can't compare the service to Andre, Nouri, Odette, Blackwattle etc
5
This place is a must visit when in SG! Go to the bar and start the evening right with some of the best bar food I have ever had. Obviously you have to combine that with some of the best drinks in the world by Joe and his team! I will be back for an extended evening soon!
5
The decor and ambience in this bar are great. The bartender is very friendly and good and happy to make something based on your likes. They have a very creative cocktail menu with a good number of options. I highly recommend this bar!
5
eaten in many great restaurants and this one is right up there for it creativity and originality. Pairing menu is highly recommended. Service was spot on, not too stuffy.
5
What an amazing place, bar man out of Savoy UK great cocktails and amazing selections of wines, and the 9 course taste menu is amazing, absolute class act
5
Splurged for my birthday dinner. I’m vegetarian and so I picked this place because of the vegetarian set menu which looked great, and it tasted even better. Every dish was above par to say the least, definitely a pleasant surprise. Special mentions for the burrata/radish dish and coconut dessert. Husband took the non vegetarian set, which he loved too. Service was excellent. Cocktail menu was quirky (we could smell strips to decide which drink we want) and the drinks were decent.
5
Walked past and popped in not knowing what to expect. As it was pretty late and I was not up for a 5 course meal I opted to sit in the bar and indulge in some cocktails and elaborate bar snacks. It was great, to say the least. Very competent and friendly bar and wait staff. I ordered the fist signature cocktail "grass" with a selection of tapas style bar snacks. Followed that with the signature cocktail "leather". Had a great time! Will try and return for a full meal next time I am in Singapore
5
I have been to many restaurants in my life but enjoyed the most in this restaurant and would love to go back again for more . We had five course without pairing as we do not drink much but after trying this we would love to do again next time with ten course and pairing. The food and presentation are so special neither French nor anything at all. They are creative and all of the course taste so well. Thanks so much for the effort 
5
I visited this restaurant with my partner and ended up opting for the full tasting menu.The food was spectacular and the number of "snacks" they provided made for an extremely filling dinner. I lost count of how many dishes we had. The service was excellent and it was a nice touch having the chefs come out to introduce each dish.Can't wait to go back agai
5
Fantastic lunch with many little bites and two true "courses"; super flavours; definitely not traditional but lots of funky stuff going on! friendly service - good looking wines and cocktails too.For me this is a two-star Michelin / 18PTS Gault Milllau and definitely better than Gaggan in Asia's Best....Highly recommended - would definitely return again on a next visit to Singapore
5
We have been to a few "Top 50" restaurants so decided to try this as it was in walking distance of our hotel. I was able to get a reservation within 24 hours via Chope app. We decided on the five course degustation menu. Our waiter/Sommelier was wonderful, very approachable and knowledgeable about the wines. It was obvious he loves what he does. The wine was paired perfectly. Some of the cocktails fell a little flat such as the "Umami bomb" which just did not bring a punch of umami. We really enjoyed meeting the young chefs as they brought out each course. The first dish a "Tom Yam mousse" could have been exceptional but it was over salted. The langoustine ravioli was a little bland but from there it went up, up, up and we really were impressed. We purchased the cheese course but it was very basic a few cubes of roasted potatoes with Stilton cheese, unmemorable. The coconut dessert was fabulous followed by some great petit fours. We would recommend this restaurant to those who enjoy young chefs with innovative ideas
5
Went for the Gourmand degustation menu and was not disappointed – beautiful dishes with various fascinating plating and interesting flavours. Wine pairing was spot on and very indulgent, thank you so much Fabian for the amazing hospitality which made us feel really welcomed and taken care of. Intimate ambience with a touch of subtle opulence which did not overwhelm with extravagance; felt totally comfortable in the luxuriousness
5
Remains consistently good over the years, great tasting food, eclectic decor and attentive service. Enough said, well deserving of a Asia's 50 best restaurants spot.
5
Loved every course. Great size main for lunch. Wonderful service. Expensive but worth it. Highly recommend!
5
Taken here for a romantic birthday lunch and was excellent
Great food; lovely wine list; not rushed
All in all a great experience
5
Amazing place for an happy hour or a late drink.
They bring you the list of cocktails plus some piece of paper samples to smell the fragrance of their special cocktails. We got the Leather and the Earl grey: fantastic.
5
We went for cocktails to tipping club several times and were amazed by their level of creativity and craftsmanship, plus the ambiance is lovely. Sadly it was always booked for dinner when we tried to go for a more substantial experience. We eventually managed to go for lunch, and wow. Words are failing me - the food was on point, the presentation superb and the service attentive. Menu changes every month, so now we have no excuses not to come back regularly!Try to book a seat at the bar for the full experience!
5
Great and creative food and presentation I highly recommend the 10 course dinner - not too much if you are moderately hungry and all so much fun! Molecular fusion at its best. Loved the service and food - highly recommend it - if there are two places in Singapore to go for me it would be this and waku ghin ...
5
Shared all variants of the set lunch amongst the 4 of us. Was pleasantly surprised by the complementary starters and palate cleansers which were equally as fantastic as dishes selected. Was particularly impressed with their rendition of the katong laksa which I would say bested the original! 5 stars for service and ambience.
5
Book this restaurant after reading the history on the website. And looking at the presentation of the website and logo, you already know that will be and amazing experience.We started with some cocktails at the bar, top class drink from taste to presentation.We had the 10 course dego, amazing each plate were so well presented and good size portion, all matched with amazing wines and cocktails.This is a place to definitely try while in Singapor
4
Went for the 3 course lunch set..we picked different dish including the laksa and beef tartar for the app then pizza risotto, Baramundi and roasted pork belly for the main. The 4 snacks before the app were all nice esp the tom tum paste. The laksa pasta with scallop are superb...however the main were not as good (only the interesting pizza risotto was nice whilst the pork belly and baramundi were not very tasty. The dessert, the texture of peach or pear sth is too so so. Unfortunately, cant try the popular soufflÃ© as the chef dropped it over and i could not wait for the new one as on the run to catch the flight. The drinks, the grass cocktail (tequila based) was worth trying. Recommend for trying once for a different experience.
5
Second visit and it lived up to our memories and expectations. All the extra little tastes throughout the meal once again amazed us. We paired drinks this time, fabulous, not just wine but cocktails at the start and finish. And were we in luck, as a special treat, Grange with our duck! One off I am sure, but a truly remarkable gesture. The whole experience, the room the open kitchen, the service. Here's a tip, this is a world class sensation and one of Singapore's very finest!
5
4 of us, simple lunch menu but more than enough choice. Additional courses (amuse bouches etc) very enjoyable. Great choice of cocktails and very good wine list. Nice buzz to the restaurant; chefs came out to introduce their food too. We'll definitely go back.
4
Tried the lunch menu on a weekday. We were impressed by the pre-meal snacks (about 4 types), starters and petit fours. Ambience wise, it was pleasant and suitable for dates and business lunches.
5
We didn't have time to do the whole tasting menu, so we decided to just go to the bar. Amazing service, absolutely delicious food and a really fun way to choose drinks - smelling tasting menu. Definitely a great experience and so far a highlight of Singapore
5
I love Tippling Club. We've been for dinner, lunch and a cocktails with a snack. Each time we've been delighted.This visit the food was exceptional and the amuse bouches made lunch so much more interesting and very good value for money. Their take on laksa was impressive, try it!Tippling Club is excellent about catering to food allergies and intolerances.The only tiny downside I can think of is the ear worm 70s music played by the young barman! Very good coffee. The staff are really good, helpful and professional
4
Great ambience, great food and preparation in a creative way. I came here 5 times in past 2 years but didn't see the standard of the food degraded but is getting a bit bored of the food . Try the 5 courses meal if you are not the big water as many sub courses in between meals may fill you up
5
What an outstanding 3course Lunch that started with snacks and finished with some delicious petit fours. The Souffle was the winner, serve with a wicked mini magnum made by their pastry team. Service was friendly and attentive all the way throughout our meal. Will be back soon for their creative dinner menu
3
We went there for lunch during National's Day. The service was average as the hostess was pretty gloomy. During the meal, there were some snacks before our appetiser and the snacks were a nice way to start the meal but there was once dish which was just rice cracker and some truffle oil drizzled over. I expected them to be more creative since it's 1 Michelin star rated. I had Quiche Lorraine as appetiser and it was a beautiful sight with ingredients that really went well together. Sadly after the appetiser everything went downhill. My main course was a Baramundi fish that tasted really bland. The texture and taste of the fish , it was way below standard compared to any average restaurant i have been. The dessert i ordered was a souffle. The souffle was nice and fluffly than came with a store bought magnum ice cream. Disappointing
5
Loved everything about it. Negroni superb. Drink choices fun and balanced.Amuse bouche well thought out and presentation spot on.Mains and their components well seasoned, flavorsome and the chef explanations were fun and welcomed.Gives a dimension to what goes on behind the scenes. Kitchen is clean and well aerated.Whole menu is well thought out.Use of herbs and greens for flavor depth is appreciated.Dessert surprises were uber fun. I cant say enough without saying that its an experience highly recommended
5
From the moment we arrived, The Tippling Club was an exciting new adventure. We started in the bar area with a cocktail each, and even choice the cocktail itself the was unique and fun (will leave the surprise to others if they haven't been here before) We then moved to our table and opted for the smaller degustation menu without paring and it was sooooo good and lots of bits and bobs in-between. i actually don't want to single out any dish as everything was amazing. our evening was a sensory journey and next time I'm in Singapore i would love to go back again
5
There is so much to admire at Tippling Club - and no it isn't a members club.A light , airy restaurant with one of the most imaginative cocktail bars anywhere. If you don't know what you want, sniff the taste cards and make up your own ! Or have the magic martini where there are four different Flavours around the rim of the glass.Chef Ryan produces great fun menus in addition to them being TOP class. The Big Mac risotto was astonishing - a really good risotto that tasted of Big Mac ! Currently he has a butter chicken masala version.The dinner menu is pricey , but superb. Lunch is a little treasure where there are still the extra courses, the tasters, the amuses bouche , but all at a very reasonable price - less that $50 Sing.And they open for lunch on bank holidays - just go !Friendly , yet formal, a really good spot
5
We went for lunch to celebrate my birthday and from the moment you walk in 'great and unobtrusive service', good choice and the food was excellent.
good choice of global wine.
A thoroughly enjoyable experience. Can't wait to try dinner
5
Really creative menu. Fantastic service and serious about drinks - great wine menu. Degustation dining - all delicious.
4
The service was good. Our foods came late and we were served with a complementary glass of white wine while waiting. That was an excellent gesture that certainly cool down the stress level.The amuse-bouche (literally means "mouth amuser" in French) served were as good and amazing as ever. Overall, the foods were good (much better than our previous visit about 2.5 months ago). They were as creative as ever. The DUCK PASTILLA was a bit too salty for the duck meat. The CELERIAC SOUP was good except the crab meat was a bit fishy. The FISH & CHIP RISOTTO was interesting with invisible fish and chip but it was delicious. The SPRING CHICKEN was prepared with girolles, cep mushroom cappuccino, manjimup truffle, except with an additional $15 and the serving was a bit too big. The dessert I ordered was PEACH MELBA SOUFFLÃ‰ with raspberry ripple ice cream in white chocolate. My guest ordered a fresh slice of FUJI APPLE wasabi, ricotta, shiso granite but we could not locate the wasabi taste. It is worth visiting this place regularly
4
Be careful here as I don't think the prices are right here. It's very good quality good , a little fu fu , tries a little too hard . It's a good looking place with with pleasant staff . Food tastes very good and presented very creatively !!!looks to be a date place 
5
Decided to go with my teenage kids and it didn't disappoint. We opted for the 10 course meal, and they devoured everything. I had been before and always enjoyed the meal, atmosphere and staff. We usually sit at the countertop to observe the staff in action. It can be pricey, but the experience is worth it.Bottom line - world class, exceptional service, food quality is second to none
5
I love this place. The chefs are pretty entertaining and super friendly. I tried a sampling menu and I was not disappointed. My taste buds have never been so awakened. Great food - honestly be open minded and try everything. Yes its expensibve but its worth it. The cocktail menu is very unique - and it matched exactly what I had and wanted, Great drinks.
5
We were there at 7:00 pm with no reservations and we sat at the bar. The tasting menu was an experience and I would recommend anyone who has the money to spare and takes pleasure in dining with all of their senses. There will be more than quite a few suprises that are not mentioned on the menu. (for more: see the spoiler alert) Definitely ask to see the cocktail menu, which comes as frangrance sticks planted on a bar cocktail strainer. Spoiler Alert: watch out for the pre-desserts LSD tab look-a-like passionfruit bomb and cheesecake tablets
4
Grab some seats at the bar and watch the kitchen theatre from which your dinner will emerge. The five course degustation was spectacular. A lot can go wrong with an ambitious menu comprising of multiple courses, however the selection of complementary flavours and perfectly prepared mains was almost faultless. The sweet chilli and crab and the scallop dish were standouts for me, wonderfully absent of a fishy taste. The interesting pre-courses, for example crispy chorizo, were well paired and delicious too. If cocktails are your passion, you won't be disappointed. A scented cocktail menu, unique perhaps if not a little gimmicky, will guide you through the wonderful selection. FYI Matt Bax opened the Tippling Club and subsequently opened the highly regarded Bar Americano cocktail bar Melbourne. Neither offerings will disappoint.
5
The 2nd Michelin Guide just came out and for some unexplainable reason Tippling Club was not awarded a Star. It's at least a 2 star in my eyes and is in my humble opinion Singapore's finest restaurant. It's great for lunch and dinner and each dish is innovative, a work of art and has Flavours that have evolved from many iterations offering balance. Ryan Clift is a genius - he used to come to Abu Dhabi Gourmet when I lived there and was the biggest draw - I sincerely hope he doesn't lose any sleep over the Michelin shun - he can continue running a superb operation that impresses tourists and locals alike. It's worth a trip for the cheesecake tablets alone. Unreal.

Excited to go the this place as heard they have a good record in Singapore especially in south east Asia. Nice interior and atmosphere. Few dishes could be my favourite but it's just the courses choices made it too complicated and every dish did't quite match course after course. Perhaps it's just another bad menu chosen for the term. I had high expectation for this restaurant that's is the reason for 3 star. Well, could still recommend this place but careful picked menu to put in courses would be better for my palate.Just little suggestion for the staffs not too be so pushy to upsale something .. we need "little privacy" on our table to have a chat. Thanks for the experiencex
5
Such an amazing lunch. Can thoroughly recommend The Tippling for lunch. It is a great place for dinner, just as good for lunch. Food, service, wine all excellent. Will definitely be going back. 🍷
4
Always enjoy going to tippling club. I was disappointed with the new menu main course selection. But overall always a great experience
5
Thank you chef Ayo for an amazingly meal. I love the taste, look, combinations, and colors of your dishes. I cannot stop admiring your talent and creativity.
5
The place was beautifully designed with fantastic branding throughout, which was worthy of the superb food. We did the 10 course tasting menu and there wasn't a bad dish. The cocktails were phenomenal as well. Couldn't recommend this place more. Great service. Worth the money.
5
....are only a few of the attributes that go for Tippling Club. My lunch experience as a Solo traveller was beyond amazing. Lee and his team have created one of the best meals I ever had. Thanks guys for an incredible experience. Two things I want to point out:1. The Cocktail card is super creative (do NOT miss out on that)2. the combination of western style dishes with asian flavours realy works a treatI can't wait to be back for dinner

My husband and I are big into cocktails and we told that we had to stop at the Tippling Club. My husband called earlier in the day and asked if we needed a reservation to have a drink at the bar. He was told that this was absolutely necessary, and so he made a booking. You can imagine our confusion when we were seated and presented with menus for their very pricey (and I'm sure very lovely) fixed price meal. We eventually realized the error and asked to just move to the bar -- since we really just wanted a drink and maybe a snack -- but it was an embarrassing and confusing start to our experience. The "hook" of the Tippling Club bar is that you smell a series of strips of paper, and based upon smell, decide what cocktail suites you best. While I'm sure that you can order a cocktail of your choice as well, it is quite fun to select your drinks for the evening, based on smell. I had one based on "earl grey" and my husband picked "grass". Both drinks were tasty and interesting -- although I could taste no earl grey in my drink
5
I can't recommend Tippling Club highly enough. It's very rare to find food that is this creative and well executed. It's even rarer to find a sense of adventure and fun in a high end restaurant. We enjoyed the 10 course degustation with wine (which actually includes wine, carefully crafted cocktails and a beer) matching. Be warned to come with an appetite, the "snacks" course (just one of the ten courses) consists of six individually served, delicious bite sized items. The creativity of the menu is great, and the execution is flawless. Even better, whereas restaurants of similar quality (and cost) can feel stuffy or pretentious, Tippling Club is full of adventure and fun. I won't spoil any surprises, but the deserts were particularly delicious and hilarious, which is a great combination.We couldn't recommend this restaurant highly enough. We'll remember our experience with a smile for a long time to come.And make sure you start your Tippling experience at the bar. The custom cocktail "menu" is a great way to start the adventure
5
2 Michelin Stars.**...Best restaurant for a twist on dining would highly recommend to take your visitors here, food great.Lunch or Dinner fully booked so get in early as popular with the locals also..Service amazing staff efficient..There is a Nice bar for a cocktail or coffee afterwards.Highly Recommend
5
The cocktail menu is delivered to you in a cocktail mixer with sample sticks, where you are required to smell each, which will determine which cocktail you want to order, options included Negroni. We sat on a high table outside and watched the world go by. The atmosphere inside looked lovely with dim lighting and people eating light bites with their drinks. Great cocktail bar off the beaten track. Not far from L'Entrecote if you visit there for dinner first
5
Had a great time with entertaining locals here that had never been. As San Francisco food snobs we loved all of it and must have tried every drink on the menu and the extended 16 plus courses that came and went as we consumed and enjoyed it all. A must place to visit.
5
Outstanding meal! Every detail was spectacular! I was there with a group of 15 people for a multi course celebration. Perfect in every way!!!
5
Great environment, professional and friendly staff and outstanding food. Possibly one of the best restaurants I have ever experienced. The chef Ryan Clift deserves accolades for his achievements here.
5
This a fixed menu Degustation restaurant with either a 5 or 10 course menu and it's expensive but worth the food experience. We loved the food and the service which was exceptional as was the food. You will. It be disappointed.
5
From the moment we stepped through the door it was Wow!
The furnishings, ambience, attention to detail, quality and presentation of food, wait staff service, quirkiness... all fantastic. Cannot rate it high enough.
Go there!
4
Brightly lit restaurant with open concept kitchen. Gorgeous plates and bowls. Delicious and interesting food! Appetizers and dessert could be better though. Flavour wise could be more bold. But nonetheless I thoroughly enjoyed my 2hrs lunch there! Love the snacks and main. Had the langoustine, big mac and raspberry soufflÃ©
5
Start with one of John's stunning cocktails before you dine - each cocktail has a card on which you can see and smell the Flavours that he uses. A real artist to watch and a delight to talk to about how he finds the perfect balance, whether off the menu or designed according to how you feel.After this delightful pre prandial entertainment, the dining room is set around the large open kitchen. An air of permanent movement pervades, but with minimal noise - Low enough to hear the background tracks in the restaurant that are all classics ! As with many quality restaurants , the lunchtime menu is much more affordable and this is no different . The 2/3 course tasting menu comes with several pre appetisers and amuses bouche, and all are stunningly prepared and plated on a variety of different platters.One of the lunchtime highlights is Big Mac risotto - believe me , just have it ! The pork is sensational and the cod is delicious.I wasn't overly impressed by the dessert offering here, but the rest of the food, allied to superbly attentive service and a great wine list, made it churlish to worry !
5
I was really looking forward to going back to the Tippling Club and i was not disappointed, I love this place, its fun and fantastic. I urge anyone to try the tippling club, go for the full mega meal with drink pairing you will have a great evening.I cannot find fault, just go its brilliant. Yes expensive but its worth it.
5
My wife and I had an enjoyable dinner. It's a place where one would need to take their time to appreciate the overall experience.We could see the thought behind the planning and flow of the degustation menu. To start the evening, the way of choosing your cocktail through your smell and sense was innovative and refreshing. We chose the 5 course option (the other was 8 course) and felt that was substantial; a number of the ingredients were from Australia, which gave it an Aussie flavor; the wine pairing was appropriate with variety from old to new world wines.The dinning setting was modern with the open kitchen concept where patrons could in a way sense the action of the food preparation. Service was friendly and professional. The bar area was romantic, with a relaxing ambience, for pre or after dinner drinks

This is a must do in Singapore the experience from beginning to end is absolutely amazing. From cocktails to start to your final desert you will have a meal that you will not easy forget. The service is exceptional and the wine and food pairing will not easily be forgotten. Ensure you book and enjoy

I got a voucher from work to come here for lunch and really had no idea what to expect. I did hear a lot of great things in advance, but the actual experience was even better. So first of all, I don't think I've ever had a degustation type meal for lunch before. We came for a 3 course meal, but received about 5 (or more??) complimentary little dishes that were all outstanding. The chefs here are so creative and talented. The ambience is great too. It's probably very expensive to come here for dinner, but I highly recommend the lunch as it's great value for only about $50 pp

It was;
Inventive
Tasteful
Crunchy
Balanced flavours
Delicious
Humourous
All in all an experience I will cherish...

Tippling Club's degustation menus are one of the best I've tasted around the world. Creative in look and taste. The team are great and very welcoming. A great spot to head to if you're looking to spoil someone!
5
A very good value set lunch, considering the exemplary food. The highlight was the Bergamot Souffle. It is uncommon to this herb in modern cooking, but was perfect in this dish
5
Again this restaurant has totally satisfied our taste buds. The food is absolutely amazing. Love the new menu, creative, delicious and beautifully presented. The service is well above 5 star. Tippling is so worth the visit. Thank you again and again Tippling Club. 🍷🍷👍👍
5
My second time here and the food never fails to impress. Service was also good. Only small complaint is that our main course took a while to be served but quite understandable given that the place was quite busy at the time.

Had dinner there yesterday with my wife and it was a success, except that both of us had some stomach issues the night after. Probably due to the fact that you cannot eat Ã  la carte and you have to choose between a 5 or 10 course set menu, meaning you get to eat a lot of small different things that do not always work well together in your stomach. Add to that five (free) starters and it's quite a combination. Still, the food is excellent, wines were great, staff is very helpful (but you don't understand anything of what half of them are saying because they have a very heavy accent, a bit strange for a place of this standing) and the overall ambiance is very good. I would recommend it to anyone for a special occasion but would warn about the many combinations if you have a somewhat sensitive stomach

The food was good but not mind blowing to warrant the price. The constant interruption of staff and be it 10 different staff did not make it relaxing or personal. Then to be constantly asked if we wanted the cheese platter to be added at a additional cost to our already over valued meal, not once but 3 times is just looking like a very amateur sales approach. It felt like being part of a production line where there was no down time between each plate serving, so you could not have any appreciation in what you just ate as the next course was up ,ready and in front of you. We had to asked to slow it down several times. I came with high hopes and expectations with reviews I had already read, went away with a big hole in the pocket with no personal connection, again food good not outstanding but with the whole experience left with nothing that was memorable....maybe it was a bad night
5
Oh my gosh. Tippling club is amazing. The service was great, which is rare in Singapore. I loved that various members of the kitchen including the chef would come out to present their respective dishes. The food really was exceptionally creative and delicious. It's not cheap but totally worth it. A dining experience that we will definitely want to enjoy again. Thank you Tippling Club

I was really excited to have lunch here due to the list of awards and accolades credited to this beautiful restaurant in recent years. I'm glad I wasn't disappointed at all. I chose the 'Lunch Experience Menu' at $95++ which may seem really pricey for lunch, but trust me it's worth what you're paying for. The pre-meal snacks were a really great addition to the start of the meal. The main courses were executed brilliantly, each beautifully presented and will leave you wanting more. I had the privilege of sitting at the bar seat where I was able to watch the chefs work on dishes in the busy and hectic kitchen. Service was impeccable, my glass of water was never empty. Every course was exceptional, and time between each course is just right, not too rushed. Overall, a very satisfying meal and will definitely come back for more
5
i ordered the 8-course lunch set, but there's some pre-snack and pre-dessert in between. they're all very tasty and bold.i especially love the strawberry cheesecake, which came in pills. the cheese plate was a tad too cheesy for me (i know this sounds stupid) and i couldnt finish it but everything else were great. my friends thought the soup was too garlicky but that really depends on your preference (i like garlics so the soup tastes super fine to me).the cocktail menu came like perfume samples. you're supposed to smell the fragrance. tried pear, caramel, and earl grey. they're all lovely.i heard the restaurant was ranked 36th in asia's gastronomy list, and recently upgraded to 27th.located in Little Korea, this place looks unassuming from the outside but always packed ok the inside. book in advance

Came for valentine's menu. love the fish and chips risotto and the sensory experience on the foie gras dish. i was a little disappointed with the lamb though.
nonetheless, a good experience.
5
Had such a great experience here. The food was sublime, interesting, tasty, FANTASIC.
Was great to have a quick chat with the chef, a talented guy that is clearly passionate about his craft.
For sure you must also try the cocktails- a real treat!
5
Came here for lunch and ordered three course menu and turned out to be much more filling than I thought! There were three complimentary starters which was plenty and by the end of the main I was super full! The couple next to us ordered a proper degustation and they looked like they had a hard time finishing it. The atmosphere was a bit loud during lunch, not a romantic setting to be exact but great place to try the top no 36 restaurant in the worl

I booked this restaurant last minute having done a quick google search of best restaurants in Singapore and finding areview that basically said it was one of the restaurants that should have received a Michelin star last year but didn't. Having gone to a Michelin Star restaurant the previous weekend (which incidentally, happens to be located around the corner from the Tippling Club) I decided to see for myself. Well, what a treat we were in for. I was blown away - EVERYTHING was so creative - from the bowls and cutlery to the paired cocktails or wines (we had the 5 course taster menu with paired drinks), the presentation was clearly part of the experience. Each course, including 5 separate 'snacks' followed by 5 courses, were served by a chef who explained the ingredients. Even the cocktails were served by a mixologist / chef. Only the wines were served by a sommelier / host. The restaurant interior was super cool - with a great weekend chilled out vibe and fun music from the bar. There were lots of people in the lounge area having cocktails and bar snacks - all of which really added to the ambience. I particularly loved the bar stools at the counter overlooking the bar and kitchen - I fully intend on returning soon to sit there and perhaps try the bar snacks and some more cocktails. This was hands down the best overall eating experience (food + restaurant + drinks + staff + service) I've ever had. What a wonderful Saturday night. This is a must do for anyone who loves their food / drinks and a bit of fun

Another trip to Singapore and this time lunch at Tippling Club. This restaurant is without doubt one of the best dinning experiences you will ever have. Whilst I have previously been to Tippling Club for dinner this time I thought I would try there more traditional lunch menu off the card, we started with 4 complimentary snacks then into the entrees I chose the cauliflower soup with textures of cauliflower and caviar and my guest had the crab both were beautifully presented and delicious. Next up mains a 3 cuts of lamb and smoked eggplant for me and a stunning pigeon and mushroom dish for my dinning companion. Next a few complimentary pre dessert morsels followed by a chocolate mint soufflÃ© with a mini magnum on the side delicious. We tried the innovative sensory cocktail menu which provided a quirky interactive menu complete with scented swatches for each drink. This restaurant is certainly at the upper price range end however the quality of the best available produce sourced fresh and flown in daily from around the world certainly justifies the price tag. I don't know where the Michelin Guide judges are eating in Singapore but they obviously haven't dined at Tippling as some of the restaurants that recieved the coveted star are not even in the same stratosphere as this wonderful gastronomic temple

I used to be a frequent patron to this restaurant. I stopped visiting it for a while because I found the service was not as good as other similarly priced restaurants in Singapore. Often, the atmosphere was like the Pike Place Market in Seattle where the fish sellers would throw the fishes around for paper wrapping for their customers to take away (they did it to entertain the customers). Here, you could hear noisy loud conversation between the chefs or waiters with their favorite customers, particularly if you were a foreigners.This time, we come back as we miss the dishes and hope that the services have improved.Well, for this recent visit, the dishes were as creative as before and it really pleased our sophisticated palates. The services were just like any average restaurants but we managed to pull some conversations and jokes with the 'new' pastry chefs (we have never seen i our previous visits).Overall, it was a good experience this time and we have decided to visit this place more frequently.Perhaps, this restaurant can learn how and where to improve their services from Les Amis.
5
We tried the 5 course pre-fixe dinner with wine pairing which actually felt like the 10 course menu. Every dish was a culinary delight and every drink was paired perfectly. The dessert chef is a young kid, we jokingly called her the mad scientist because every dish was something innovative and a delight on the palette. On point service. Dine at the bar if possible, it's more interactive and fun.
4
Overall the experience was good. We liked the deco and the original tableware as well as the way dishes are presented. We were a bit disappointed by the quantity and despite we had the 7 course menu we were still hungry at the end. We all know this is where the margin is but the restaurant could make an effort to propose wines at more affordable prices.
5
Pretentious food perhaps, but in very casual and unprepossessing surroundings. The problem (?) with the fascinating 10 course Menu Gourmand was that you get 5 or 6 fabulous amouse bouches before you even start.The food is very clever and tasty. The service was absolutely superb - smooth and at just the right pace with the same interval between each course. The chef who had prepared each course brought it to the table and explained the myriad of ingredients, although the one who brought the fish & chips risotto seemed to lack a sense of humour when I asked for vinegar and ketchup, even though he had paired it with English ale and I couldn't see a chip!The only thing that I didn't think was a success was the wine pairing, but that's a matter of taste. All in all an enthralling experience. They're opening a place called GROW in Bali and I certainly look forward to trying it.
5
We had the 5 course classic which ended up being about 12 small courses with all the mini starters and in betweens. Food looked stunning, tasted stunning and the service was brilliant.I will most certainly be back, one of the best meals and restaurant experiences I have had in Singapore.
5
Third time here and yet again it hasn't disappointed! Service, food and cocktails, exceptional! A must try in Singapore!

Three stars should not be regarded as an insult to a restaurant, average means a perfectly respectable meal, though not exceptional. Nor should four stars be a suggestion that a restaurant is not quite up to the mark. For five stars to be a relevant grading they should be awarded sparingly for quite an exceptional experience. The five star grading for the Tippling Club here is for one of the most impressive meals we have enjoyed in the past year. The restaurant is located away from the bright lights of Singapore in a street in Chinatown lined by small unprepossessing establishments. Inside, the dining area is broken up into smaller connected spaces and there is a central open kitchen surrounded by some counter seating. We were four for lunch and we drank Sapporo beer rather than wine or champagne. There was a multi-course tasting menu with paired wines but we felt that it would be too much at lunch, though by the end of our meal did wonder if we had missed out on an even better experience than our splendid three course meal. Although it was a three course selection the first ordered course was preceded by three different amuse bouches. The first was a pair of charred chilli peppers, two blackened cylinders that should not have tasted of anything but with the wasabi based sauce that came with them the taste was exciting, and they were eaten with a pair of surgical forceps. Each was ingenious but in none of the courses is flavour ever sacrificed for appearance. Flavours are strong and fully developed. For the course I called my main I had a Christmas leftover risotto, a risotto garnished with all the sorts of things you might find on your plate for a traditional English Christmas dinner. Even some tiny Brussels sprouts. The egg-nog soufflé on the dessert menu caught everyone's eye as we planned our meal but by the time we reached desserts we were done. The lunch service is astoundingly good value for the quality of the meal and the smooth, pleasant and professional service
5
This is not a cheap place but the value of the experience of the meal far exceeds the price. It is a pretty casual contemporary space with local art on the walls and most tables have a view of the kitchen where all the magic happens. everyone from the bar , dining room and kitchen makes you feel welcome and helps explain and guide you through the meal. It is a journey for sure- they offer a 5 and 10 course - go for the 5 it is plenty of food and make sure to add the drink pairing. The drink pairing is actual full sized cocktails and wines not the short pour you typically get with a pairing. The creativity of presentation - flavors- was perfect. none of that would mean anything if the food wasnt good and here each course focused on a key ingredient and showcased its flavor to the fullest- beets, mushrooms, red peppers courses were my favorite

10 dishes for SGD 290 but on top of that they have a lot of snacks and pre-desert so there is a lot of food. Personally I don't need so much food if I could have really good food. The snacks were the best dishes in the houses. They had a spiced foie gras which reminded me of apple pie but my partner hated it. Then they had a fish and chips risotto that reminded both my partner and I of Mcdonalds fish fillet - that is not a good sign. I liked the pork jowl dish and their cheese toast. Essentially some hits and misses. Service was really good and I had a question about olive oil cavier that the cook answered in really good detail. Food was good and service was good - however essentially when it comes to fine-dining restaurants, there are others in town and I wouldn't choose this one to come to as there are those that are really over the moon
5
From the moment we arrived to the moment we left, the Tippling Club impressed. We had an option to sit at the table overlooking the kitchen and would recommend that experience. the chefs were generous with cooking tips and watching the assembly meant we enjoyed the food even more. We chose the matching wines/ cocktails and were not disappointed. Best gin martini pre dinner & we chose to have a digestive in the intimate well stocked bar. Amazing
5
It's my second visit to the restaurant after more than a year and it has held up its standards very well. Although we ordered a 3-course set lunch, we were surprised by 3 or 4 "chef's compliments" at the beginning of our meal, and in between the courses. They were all good - taste as well as presentation.My cauliflower soup was beautifully presented, the creamed soup was poured over a beautifully sliced piece of roasted cauliflower. My cod main was a tad overcooked, but it was made up for by the other "surprises".At $60++ for lunch - it's great value for money.Compared with the other M stared restaurants in Singapore, I would say that this one standa above.
4
Went there for lunch and tried their Christmas lunch menu which is $60 per pax It was a good fusion food with lots of freebies They change their menu every month and the boss himself , an Englishman mans the restaurant He is very friendly with good PRFor dinner it is lots more expensive with the menu at $380There is also a corner where you can have drinks and some finger foodOnly issue is if you drive this area is quite hard to look for car park

A lot of people are amazed by the novelty, but the fundamentals are and remain: ingredients, precision of cooking and dressing, authenticity, balance between senses. For all of that Tippling Club fails or is average at best. We took the 10 dishes course, starting at 8:40pm and left 3 hours later, for 437 SGD per person. I found the wines served at pairing a surprisingly long sequence of bland wines, beer served after a sweet wine, and a couple of well inspired cocktails. In fact the cocktails we took before the course were very good. Out of the 18 plus pieces we were served 2 were striking: a very well done white gaspacho, and a ball of madarin granité with spices (served too cold). The rest was pretentious, uninspired with any of the fundamentals missing, sometimes with servings carrying twice the same "caviar" of stale olive oil - something which should never happen. Terrible statements cannot qualify the bill at 1751 SGD for 4 of us. Bistro table. Untidy bathroom. This restaurant is to be avoided, bar is probably a good option, for casual stuff. Service was friendly, sometimes cooks bringing dishes, sommelier overly qualifying the wines. Loud music playing Madonna, and other wedding party tunes was a nuisance
5
Always excellent - third visit and the standards have been maintained. Congratulations We ordered the set lunch. Prior to the start of the lunch we received a few appetisers including the fried peppers, tomato soup and an amazing foam. The salmon starter was flavourful and the burrata was a great contrast. The cod was cooked just right and the egg nog soufflé was cooked just right with a real Christmassy feel.
5
Wow!! Dropped in for lunch on a busy Friday and had an excellent experience. Welcome was friendly and very accommodating. Not the ideal choice with a one year old daughter (small venue and intimate) but staff did all they could to accommodate. Menu a little tricky to understand on first viewing but once explained it was easy enough. Great dishes carefully executed using quality ingredients. Electric atmosphere. Crazy energy from chefs serving at the tables. Interesting drinks and all round gem of an eatery. We will be back!!!
5
Had a lovely Christmas lunch with the girls. Food, service, and atmosphere was perfect.will definitely be going back in the new year.

The decor is great, the food is top notch, the service is very good - but it stops there. The lights are way too bright, the music is way too loud and what's with the 80's music in what should be a cool restaurant. Unusual having no wifi too. This is not a cheap eatery and yet we were unable to have a decent conversation over the top of Tina Turner's Simply The Best! Can do better
5
service and food quality are both in high standard. We did enjoy the night with surprise and fun to guess what we were eating. although we didn't go for wine pairing but the bottle of white that we ordered was fantastic, the red is ok, maybe I didn't choose the right one to pair with our main course.overall experience is good, I will come back again if there is a suitable

My first visit to Tippling Club was 7-8 years back in Dempsey . Used to go there for lunch and for their cocktail drinks. Went to the new premise once about 3 years back and refused to go back because I personally feel for the price n the food I am getting, I have many other options.Was invited there for dinner recently and my verdict remained.
4
The Tippling Club service was the best dining experience in Singapore I have come across thus far since moving here eleven months ago. My favorite server from the night (I believe his name was Joseph (he was Singaporean + lived in Melbourne) was so kind, knowledgeable, and welcoming throughout the entire dinner. The food was incredible as well and for knowing this restaurant encompasses a "small portion tasting" menu, the classic menu was actually very filling. I cannot imagine being able to eat the gourmand option. Each bite exploded with unique flavor and the drinks were incredible as well. I truly, truly want to give 5 star, but.... the pricing was quite steep that I'm forced to give it a 4. There are just so many incredible food places in Singapore that I'm afraid I've tasted quite similar food. Please keep in mind the dining experience is just so lovely, the service is amazing, and the food is some of the best. If you have the extra cash or are celebrating a birthday or event, I highly recommend making this your place to dine
5
I came to singapore for celebrate my birthday, especially was booking for birthday lunch in here. I choosed lunch experince menu and just blown away with all the foods and also when the chef was explaining all the dishes, it must be perfect! seating in the bar and facing off to the kitchen, make me so happy. service, I would like to say, maybe can be better if everyone can interact to the guest like adelyn to me, and didnt put "formal" face.. but Big thanks to adelyn to her great hospitality, chef ayou also joe, your cocktail are very good and inspiring!! would love to come back and recommend this restaurant to my colleagues
5
My partner and I dined here last night in celebration of his birthday.We chose the gourmand menu and were completely blown away with the quality of the food, as well as the high service standard provided by all employees. Since moving to Singapore 9 months ago we have really struggled to find a restaurant that can provide great quality food in addition to a high level of service. Majority of restaurants really fall short in the area which has been very frustrating. You can clearly see that the level of training all employees have been provided has been extremely thorough and this really completes the entire dining experience.Every dish was innovative, well explained, and delicious. Chef Ryan interacts with the diners and served many of the dishes personally whilst sitting at the counter (which is the best position in the restaurant). Such a great experience, highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a complete experienced. We will be back without a doubt
3
It is actually very good but considering the price they charge for what it is.. I had to take off one star. Many other restaurants are more wholesome in food and service and esp ingredients being used.Came for business lunch, the restaurant was quite empty. Neither kitchen staff or front of the house whose came to explaining each dish was very friendly or smiley. It is your go to restaurant if you are into molecular and ready for the hefty price tag
5
The menu was amazing, so many flavours, so much texture and three hours later we left!! The time flew by; each course is delivered by the sous-chef who created it with an explanation of what was being served and the thoughts behind it. The overall ambience was superb, I would recommend it wholeheartedly
4
Have lunched at Tippling Club on quite a few occasions and the food has always been excellent, especially in their execution. Service, though efficient, cannot be described as genuinely friendly. Each course is introduced by one of the kitchen staff and none with a smile, just as a matter of fact. It's a pity. It would have made a good restaurant one I would like to go back to more often.
2
Booked for a special occasion and was really disappointed. We hate at the bar. Atmosphere was not great as the restaurant was far from being full.
Food is good and supposedly creative.
Will not go back. Lots of places in Singapore are better for cheaper
5
Service as expected as cos of meal is very high. We took the lunch experience, a 5 courses SGD95+++ instead of the 2-courses, 3-courses and degustation at SGD170+++ without wine pairing. Each course is truly an experience and remarkable taste and presentation. Love their cocktails.
5
This place has a sensory menu for its cocktails whereby you choose the drinks from blotters with scents that you resonate with the most. Awesome interior design takes you to another dimension and you feel like you're in an English place instead of a bar in Singapore. Easily accessible in town and highly recommended
5
Our first visit at the new location (TC has become a regular venue anytime in Singapore)The new venue is an upgrade in many ways. The major difference (apart from its larger size) is that its now a more conventional 'table' rather than bar dining style.Personally , we prefer the 'action' at the bar so asked and succeeded in moving to the bar. We didn't regret that!The cooking has become more confident and relaxed without loosing any of it's quality, craft and sheer artistic innovation.Its simply one of the World's best at this delicate , multi course dining experiences.We cant resist still ordering the drink pairing which adds extra layers of fun to the experience.The bar area is now like a real cool bar and makes pre dinner and post dinner more enjoyable too.This is not an inexpensive dining experience but it is one of the best and I don't think this quality and style could be expected to be cheaper.All the staff were friendly , informative and helpful.One minor downside - the music is TERRIBLE - (cheesy , trashy old pop). It was so bad that I asked who had chosen it - i was told (with a nod to me of agreement) that 'the boss' decided. Its hard for me to imagine how the boss of such a hip and classy place could possibly have such a music taste. But its worth tolerating.Simply one of the best dining experiences anywhere
5
From the moment you sit at the bar with a pre-dinner cocktail you realise this place is special. The drinks menu alone is an event - an olfactory sensory overload! And the cocktails aren't bad either!We went for the 10-course tasting menu with the drinks pairing. Every course had real invention, tasted sublime and was beautifully presented. The drinks pairing was likewise innovative as it included not just wine but cocktails and even a beer.As for ambience, that was great too - buzzy without being too loud. I personally like the fairly 'basic' decoration even in fine-dining restaurants - by that I mean scrubbed wooded tables, simple chairs, etc - others might not. What was very evident that the owner and staff pay great attention to the little details as the entire establishment is impeccably maintained from the entrance to the bar area, to the main dining room and toilets.Finally prices; well it's fine dining in Singapore, so on a par with London. But the quality matches the price so in my view decent value
5
First time here although we tried to find a couple of times at Dempsey Hill but it is much easier to find now they are at Tanjong Pagar. Brought a client here for lunch. We had the 3 course lunch menu. Food was excellent as was the service. I began with the Fois Gras, followed by the chicken and finished with the banoffi soufflÃ©. Little pricey and definitely somewhere you want to save for special occasions but was fantasti
5
This is my third time dining at the Tippling Club and each experience has been unique with food and drink pairings that are flawless and rarely equaled elsewhere. In fact this is one of the greatest dining experiences you will ever have. We chose the Garamond multi course menu and were fortunate to be seated at the counter facing the kitchen watching Chef Ryan conducting the kitchen brigade as a symphony of flavour and quirky avante garde flavour combinations and drink pairings came our way. It is difficult to describe in words the artistry, skill and daring of this high wire culinary act suffice to say go in sit back and be wowed and amazed by some of the best food you will find anywhere. This restaurant is relaxed and the food and drink philosophy is fun quirky slightly challenging but always accesable. Don't be peturbed by the high ticket price this is superb produce driven, cutting edge food delivered with a laconic laid back style that will suprise challenge and deliver.
5
I have visited the Tippling Club on a few occasions now and i'm never disappointed. The lunch menu has an array of dishes that will suit all pallets. I went for the Chilli Crab and Big Mac Risotto. You are already blown away by the intense flavours of the Amuse-Bouche and then straight into Tippling's take on chilli Crab, fantastic presentation I then went for the Big Mac Risotto more out of intrigue than anything but again intense flavours and amazing presentation. I finished with a Banana Souffle and Caramel & Vanilla Ice cream. The rest of the party were equally as impressed with the food. The only downside is the waiting staff do not seem to fully understand the items on the menu. Whilst the chefs do come and explain the various courses to you in detail perhaps when you are presented with the menu some knowledge of the dishes on offer to assist the client in making a choice would help. Its a minor criticism but something that should in no way detract from the main even which is the food. How the restaurant did not get a Michellin Star is beyond me
5
started with selecting the cocktails at the bar from the new menu (nice twist, even if I don't buy the childhood memory idea - the "Pear" was awesome). Classic menu was really really yummy, and the presentation out of this world. little surprises all the way.. highlights for me - the john dory, the lamb and the desert. didnt try the cheese dish myself but my two co-diners weren't too impressed with that one. very good cocktails/white wines for pairing.. all in all - a great night out. atmoshpere and restaurant/bar are great too. service, immaculate. head chef coming out to present one dish himself and have a quick chat - chapeu
5
A welcoming greeting at the door started off a truely awesome gourmet evening.The restaurant is trendy, but not unnecessarily sophisticated. Casual and smart, but not pretentious. Generally good spacing between the tables, so you don't feel you are sitting at the neighbours table, but still cosy. If you are a couple I recommend sitting at the kitchen counter/bar table - with a view to the kitchen. Watch the magic unfold in front of you :-)Great background music add to the ambiance.We went for the Gourmand tasting menu consisting of 15+ dishes (including snacks and pre-desserts) ranging over seafood, beef, fish in various forms all beautifully and imaginatively crafted - served with passion. The tasting menu comes with a wine pairing option consisting of wine, beer and cocktails. We went for a bottle of wine instead and got some good advice from the Sommelier. We are surely coming back for more
4
It is known for their cocktails but I found the food decent and presentation even more intriguing. The flavor is certainly not subtle and further accentuated by the wine pairing. I can see why there are divergent views on this venue.
5
Wonderfull food and great service ! It was pure pleasure to have lunch here and strongly recomend it to all food lovers ;)
4
This restaurant was fantastic! The food was delicious, surprising and fun. Food that you never thought could exist in the shapes and forms that it was served up in. Cocktails were very very good! The service was smart, friendly and attentive. Would definitely go back.
5
Truly a journey of senses, beautifully presented and scientifically explained. Tippling Club does not disappoint, subtle flavours that are impeccably balanced - Chef Ryan and his crew deserve to be applauded for their creativity and ingenuity of flavours. Well done!
4
It was a surprise when we ordered 2 course meal, it came with a set of appetiser and dessert. Good food presentation. However, the ambience was a little noisy for business meal.
5
Dining in any city is a wonderful experience, but if you want to experience a true sensation - look no further than The Tippling Club. Ryan Clift's amazing restaurant has to seen, eaten and enjoyed to be believed.The experience is truly exceptional (if selecting the Gourmand i would recommend the wine paring/as it is truly the full experience in its finest form - every drink, cocktail and wine all matched together for a complete sensory overload)The staff are attentive and smart, the chefs share flavours/information on cooking and also styles etc - honestly speaking the attention to detail is flawless.My favourite's from the Gourmand selection are CRAB nashi pear, shiso puree, yuzu & soy gel and A4 TORIYAMA BEEF horseradish burrata, japanese fruit tomato, artichoke. The Tomato Basil Lava Lamp is also amazing.. and the charred bell peppers, shoyu wasabi dip.A true dining theatre experience for the most amazing Singapore Luxe Traveller
4
We enjoyed a good meal at Tippling Club. Amazing flavor combinations and beautiful presentation. The staff was nice and the atmosphere as good as the company (it was our anniversary...). But, there were a couple of really odd dishes. The cheese course was a complete let down and so was the weird smoked bacon chocolate
5
I had the opportunity of dining at Tippling Club last weekend and I would strongly encourage it to anyone who enjoys having good food paired with innovative cocktails in a relaxed yet stylish atmosphere.Pros:-Perfect balance of creative/refined dishes. Fun dishes without the pretentious attitude that has become so common amongst many high end establishments.-Amazing cocktails served in incongruous ways-No thrills dining experience and reasonable pricing in spite of the high quality of the foodCons:-We really enjoyed having the kitchen staff serves the dishes and explain their content, but the some of the cooks were a bit shy, or appeared to be quite stressed, so the explanations were too brief and didn't seem too natural-We would have loved to have the chef stop by our table as he was walking the room the whole time we were thereLet's not fool ourselves though - the experience was fantastic and thinking of any negative point is quite a challenge. Do yourself a favour and take your date to Tippling Club

Truly a special occasion restaurant and a treat for the senses. A beautiful space, the bar, kitchen counters and restaurant all have tremendous attention to detail. And so it is with both the drinks list and the menu. We chose the five course but with all the amuse bouches and palate cleansers and pre-desserts and petit fours, we lost count! Just wonderful, perfectly paced, delivered with professional warmth and humour, everything explained with love. Clearly prepared with love. Clever ideas, palate twists and presentation delights. The wine list contains some hard to find gems and also some great choices by the glass. I simply cannot recommend this restaurant highly enough. When the owner/chef chats to tables, it is the mark of a truly professional host. We'd been musing how the dinner reminded us of Melbourne's famed Vue de Monde. No surprise then to learn this is the Chef who took Vue to esteemed 3-Hat status. Melbourne's loss quite a few years ago now, Singapore's gain! Now a proven, well-established and rightly acclaimed leader in Singapore's burgeoning food scene. You know before you go it is in the top tier of restaurants in terms of price, but it more than delivers. Value. Experience. Memories.

Tippling Club has been my favorite since the time they were in Dempsey Hill. Though I personally like their Dempsey location better (more quiet, better when you want to focus on enjoying the food), their Tanjong Pagar location is still quite nice. It feels more happening now and probably that's why they move to this location.Service remains attentive and excellent as usual. And food remains excellent. Though they change their set menu from time to time, there are a few courses which keep coming back.- Charred pepper with soy wasabi dip. They made the pepper looks like burnt log. Very nice to look at, and very nice to eat too.- Tomato water and basil oil. The first time it came in the lab tube form, but over time they change the presentation. Still with clear glass container, but not the lab tube anymore. The water looks very clear but you can certainly taste the tomato flavor there.- Hokkaido scallop, parsley puree, purple (or pink) garlic soup. Served warm, and never fails to bring warmth to my heart.- Different texture of milk. One of their specialty. Love this dessert so much!Other than these, I also enjoy their local/Asian touch --- tomyam mousse, laksa mousse. And the ingredients from Europe --- like their Bresse pigeon.Overall, very creative restaurant. Never fails to impress me. And I like the fact that I never feel too stuffed after the dinner here. At other fine dining places, after 10-13 courses, the feeling was so much different. Would recommend to others.Note: I use food photos from two different visits in this review

Went for lunch. As always it was delicious. For me one of the best while in Singapore. Even the lunch menu is good enough to surprise you each time.
5
Without doubt one of the best meals that I have ever eaten. Good and service was fantastic. Can't wait for an excuse to go there again!

Creative modern cuisine with a touch of molecular cooking. We ordered the regular 5 course tasting menu although the first course was actually a trio of small starters.Dishes were well presented and tasted delicious. We sat at the bar so was served directly from the kitchen and we could see all the well drilled preparation work of the busy chefs. Only complaint to the service was the explanation of the various dishes - they were so complicated (trend nowadays where they need to give detail of the ingredients and cooking method) and the chefs spoke too fast for us to understand. Also the white Californian Primitivo at $165 we ordered was pretty poor.Our friend paid so I don't know how much it was and cannot judge value, although I suspect it wasn't an inexpensive fare
5
The restaurant itself is gorgeous. The service is AMAZING. the food is lovely. The cost is extravagant. It is an experience that I recommend to try but not one you would do on the regular. This is one of those places you would go to for a celebration or an anniversary etc. You cannot fault the place, which also mean a hefty price tag. Easily one of the top ten restaurants in Singapore

We took some clients here and sat in the back part of the restaurant. The atmosphere and design of the place is really well done. What I didn't like was that they use a blender in the open kitchen that seems to be constantly running as it is integral part of the tasters before the meal and the deserts. It just made conversation very awkward and difficult.The cocktails were delicious and were made with care. I'd definitely recommend trying a few. We had the lunch menu, which seems to be much more affordable than dinner. My favourite part of the meal were the tasters bits that I didn't even order. My starter, beetroot salad, was actually really nice, so I take that back. It was just the scallops and desert were not nearly on par with the previous courses we had received. They weren't bad, but they were a let down over the course of the meal. Everything was very well presented on the plate perfectly and the waiters were very friendly and helpful.I would recommend going here if you fancy trying some place new and don't mind spending a few dollars. The food is good, but I didn't walk about feeling blown away
5
I've eaten here once for lunch and twice for dinner and every time it has been phenomenal. Big shout out for Ayo (the sous chef) as looked after us so well, he even gave us a couple of extra snacks. The dinner is excellent but does cost a small fortune, however the lunch deal is very well priced. Do not come here looking for a cheap eat... instead think of it as an eating experience that is pricey but worth it. As we have been for dinner before within the last couple of months, I was worried that the food would be the same, I was very surprised and pleased that almost all the courses were different. They kept some of the signature dishes (purple garlic soup) which is a highlight of the meal. This is by far the best meal I've eaten, the service was great and the cocktail list is also very interesting. The drinks pairing is good fun as it's not just wine, but cocktails too. This is another thing that sets the tippling club apart from the rest of the fine dining in Singapore. Highlights are: The scallops in purple garlic soup and the crab wrapped in pear
5
Friends took me to this place for my birthday treat. I was blown away by each dish that came to the table. So, so so enjoyed the meal. We licked our plates clean!!!!! :) Would recommend this place to anyone who appreciates good food. Go for lunch as it is cheaper than going for dinner

The Tippling Club is well known for its drinks made by its in house bartenders. Besides drinks, it is also a restaurant and offers 2 course and 3 course lunch set during weekdays. The place is decorated in modern and stylish way with open kitchen.I was showed to a counter who offered a great view of the chefs making desserts. While it was noisy with the noise from the kitchen, it was funny watching the staffs at work. And I got most of the dishes served straight from the chefs, who also explained about the dishes themselves. Between the 2 course and 3 course lunch, I decided to go with the 3 course which cost $60++. I started the meal with an aperitif cocktail.Tanaka Collins ($20++)yuzu vodka, citrus, gomme, sodaThe drink was like a lemonade soda. I felt that the vodka part was barely there.The lunch began with a a trio of amuse-bouches.The first amuse-bouche was curry leave tempura with a coconut curry mousse, served in a rock. The tempura was light and crispy, while the curry flavour was barely there. It was really unexpected.The next amuse-bouche was charred grilled red pepper in squid ink tempura, served on a stone plate with tweezers.The tempura was light and crispy. It was served with a soy wasabi dip which tasted stronger in miso than wasabi.The last amuse-bouche served was basil sauce with tomato flavoured olive oil. It looked like a lava lamp. The basil and tomato were distinct. Although it looked like oil, the taste was not that oily.Starter : Artichoke Soupquail egg, air baguette, avruga caviarThe soup smelt great from far. It was rich and creamy. But the surprise of the dish was the air baguette which turned to be a crispy pillow puff. It was encased with a smoky savoury mousse which filled with seafood flavours.Main : Braised Pigs Earchicken & truffle mousse, morels, pomme mousseline, perigourdine jusThe pig ear was crunchy and soft, with a savoury stuffing, sitting on top of a savoury mash potato mousse. The morels (a type of mushrooms) were well braised and juicy. The spinach which served with it was disappointing as it was too salty and overcooked with parts tasting quite bitter.Dessert : Snickers Bar Soufflepeanut butter mini magnumThe souffle was light and airy, with a bit of nutty texture at the bottom. The magnum had bits of peanut butter in it.Lastly there was petiti four to end the meal with. There was crunchy almonds slices topped with almond mousse and compressed blueberries, matcha chocolate with yuzu drop, and hazelnut praline chocolate. I was very full but these were so yummy.Overall the food was unique in its own way, offering an unique experience in taste and presentation. Service was great, with water refilled often. Do not leave without paying a visit to its restroom. There was Penhaligon's (very expensive brand) hand lotion and liquid hand wash available

Finally went to TC on Wed for lunch with friends. Started with drinks at the bar, then 3 course lunch, then drinks at the bar. First and foremost, the atmosphere is easy going and inviting. From the moment we walked in staff were friendly and attentive. Long large tables with a funky addition that all the chairs were different.The bar is small but impressive, bottle hanging from the ceiling and lots of them, even had some weird, wonderful and not so common liqueurs available.The food was great, you choose you three course and you are alos then treated to some in befores, afters and in betweens. My favourite being the basil and tomatoe consomme shot. On a table f 7 we pretty much covered the menu, all was presented well with a waiter or chef explaining each dish. The big surprise ofr us was the Fish & Chip risotto. Beef cheeks were excellent, Hokkaido scallops cook perfectly (not easy), the foie gras starter just melted and a nice touch was the cheese of the day which came out as a perfectly cook cheese sandwich - a great and pleasant finish if you didn't go for a sweet desert.The wine list was broad enough for most tastes and fair to reasonably priced.The only disappointing thing was I hadn't made the effort to go months ago. It deserves all the accolades and praise it has been getting.It a long time since I was impressed with a restaurant of this level. The staff, chefs, food and environment tear stripes off the higher priced BS places popping up all over Singapore

We saw reviews on the Tippling House and chose it as a fine dining experience in Singapore. The meal was a disappointment and the $750 bill for two degustations and a bottle of wine was obscene given the quality of other restaurants in this city. The main dishes of the 10 course degustation were disappointing, ranging from an underwhelming foie gras, fatty squares of pickled pork to a sloppy take on risotto. Everything was incredibly salty and left us feeling reasonably ill. We told wait staff our concerns about the bland but heavily salted food between courses. We were told all the salt was natural and were presented with further, similar dishes including a plate of melted salty cheese with bread crumbs as the first dessert course. Despite voicing our concerns we noted staff provided themselves a 10% service charge on the final bill. If you are looking for a serious restaurant in Singapore we'd recommend looking further afield
5
We always go there every time in Singapore always been great. Tasty, innovative, well presented. We were here for lunch last time had the 3 course for $60 great value for quality that you get. Book ahead as its popular.
5
As a previous review mentioned.....'art on a plate'!! Very tasty art mind you!! The whole experience was a true delight. Impeccable service, understated elegance for decor and scrumptious food. What more can one want. It's the kind of place you want to shout about from the roof tops whilst at the same time keep a total secret just for yourself!! Divine!!
5
Inventive, clever, humorous, surprising, fun, creative, are all words I'd use to describe the food entertainment at Tippling Club.Full of twists and turns, and seamless, unrushed service.We chose the full tasting menu which was possibly a little too ambitious and a lot of food. And chose our wines which meant we weren't crawling out of the restaurant.Will be back
5
Firstly , an apology for the lateness of this review . My husband suffered an accident whilst we were in Vietnam ( Following Singapore ) & that & other circumstances have meant reviews are very belated ! Brought a friend here for lunch as a birthday treat & it was well worth the visit.The surroundings are lovely with a very old colonial feel.The service was great & efficient & the menu ( & food on arrival ) was well explained.The food was plated very artistically & was a picture to look at - you almost didn't want to eat it as seemed a shame to disturb !!It was a nice touch to get not 1 but 3 different Amuse Bouches to begin & sweet treats to finish. Our lunch was 3 courses & was great value for the standard of both meal & presentation.Recommende

Had lunch at Tippling Club few months ago and thought it can be Michelin standard! So I can’t wait to bring my partner here for dinner. We finally made it and dinner is a standard Classic Menu (5-course) with or without wine-pairing. We choose the wine pairing which on their menu listed SGD 275++ per pax. But I was not thrilled by the dinner, probably because the price is a lot higher I’m expecting more. Their starter appetizer are cool and tasty but they’re the same as that I’d for lunch few months ago. :( I was expecting them to “educate" us the wine they pour how it goes with our course but nothing was touched on our wine, they just pour when 1st course was served. Total we’d 2 white, 1 red and 1 shot (like a Tequila shot but a lot more tasty). The white wine was brilliant but I would have just order them as a standard glass since it only cost SGD 22 per glass. The addition wine pairing cost us SGD 105++ per person, I could have 4 glass of their white at only SGD 88! The food was ok but I was disappointed with the overall experience. Will come back for their lunch set but probably not for their dinner and definitely not for their wine pairing
5
This restaurant sets just the right tone the moment you walk in - the bar is beautiful with its hanging bottles and funky space , the open plan kitchen gives you an insight to the magic being made and the table set up with a single orchid and an olive oil and vinegar bag holding the cutlery and the beautiful art work on the walls - you know you're in for a treat! The food and wine that follows is amazing and every course an adventure - explained by the chefs themselves you are not left in fought as to what dishes are. The service is fantastic and staff are genuinely happy to be there. A must visit!!!!
5
I will start by saying I was not feeling very well on that day.. And when we arrived at the restaurant I had a massive headache and felt really feverish (when I got home was 39,5 so imagine!). Anywhoo, this little intro was just so you know how wonderful the meal was.. even feeling like **** I could not leave the amazing food I was being served behind. Ah, and the set up and the atmosphere couldn't be better. Two notes: (1) I did not like the main course - lamb - and the dessert - not a fan of milk - and the chefs accommodated my requests to change these courses (lamb became lobster and the milky dessert became this strawberry delicacy I wish I remembered the name!) (2) the owner and chef - Super nice person - realised I was feeling ill and sent over a tea -lemon and ginger. Really nice gesture.Definitely recommend it and will go back soon to fully enjoy the venue and the food
5
When I was told over the phone that the restaurant was left with counter seats, I was very apprehensive, fearing lack of service, high level of discomfort and terrible smoke and smell coming out of the open kitchen. None of those fears came true.And the best about the counter seats is that we got to see Chef Ryan Clift and his guys in action preparing the dishes. Furthermore, Chef Clift was extremely friendly and struck conversations several times with my colleagues and I -- which is a rare thing to experience in top end restaurants like Tippling Club, as the chefs tend to be cocooned up in the closed-door kitchen. Hence, while the staff was polite generally, it was Chef Clift that made our day, explaining his dishes with so much passion. He even bothered to send us off as we were going out of the restaurant.The food was magical - the snacks, palate cleanser, appetiser and desert were excellent, but that Iberico cheek meat was phenomenal! If the management of the restaurant reads this, that cheek meat should be maintained as regular in the menu list.I highlight recommend this place - I will definitely come back over and over again
5
This is my second visit to the Tippling club and this visit solidified my opinion that this is the best gastronomic experience in Singapore. I ate with 2 friends while on holiday and both enjoyed the experience so much that they continued to talk about their favourite dishes for days afterwards. I had the vegetarian menu whilst they had the non- veg. Cocktails were amazing, service was great and the food delicious. Would highly recommend a visit, though make sure you book in advance especially for Friday and Saturday nights
5
I was recommended this restaurant by a colleague in London, and I took a fussy frenchman and an Aussie who's a total foodie. It's not cheap but great value in my opinion, great food, well match wine flight, just a great experience, all the dishes were of a very high quality, using unusual ingredients, very highly recommended
4
The set lunch at this restaurant was outstanding. Very nice. But the dessert was not as good. Service was perfect and helpful. Prices quite ok for lunch and I personally like the variety of lunch offered.
5
Do yourself a favour when in Singapore and dine at the Tippling Club. Delicious and creative degustation menu with a wine list to match. The pre/ post dinner cocktail list is also a must. My tip, the smoky old fashioned.
5
Went for a business lunch and was very pleased with the taste bursts.. Innovative fusion of local food.. Highly recommend specially for business lunches or lunch dates
5
Went for the set lunch which was 46 for two courses and 60 for three. We opted for the two course. The meal started with fried peppers with an amazing spicy sauce. The tomato salad was unusual and had different tomato Flavours and textures. The fish was also perfectly cooked. We were also given a very different version of gazpacho which helped clear the palate. No time or space for dessert. Highly recommended.

This place does great food, no question. We were there for a business dinner, and had the full-on tasting menu, with the drinks pairing. Although each dish was great, in the end it became a little relentless. The first of the many "courses" is described as "snacks", but is actually a sequence of five small dishes - so this is before your real starter! (This also meant you are are waiting a long time before your next authorised drink!)It goes on a long time and be warned if you ask for a little more of any of the wine ration that is paired with each course, you will be charged even though the menu with pairing is already SGD 430 ++We suffered from a couple of incidents of inattentiveness but in general the service was good. The ambience and decor is all fineSo probably a five star for the food, which was innovative and really well presented. When the Michelin guide arrive in Singapore later this year, I expect this to feature. But it really needs to, given the price
5
Well, I've been fortunate enough to eat in some Europe's most renown restaurants. Believe you me The Tipling Club is up there with the best. From your first cocktail to the final course your senses are turned upside down with pure delight of the culinary ingenuity. Course by course different flavours and textures are revealed to your pallet. Alchemy at times for sure. Don't see the point in trying to explain what we had to eat, just make sure you go when in Singapore. Tajong Pagar Road is full of bars and shops so make a night of it rather than just going to the restaurant. Thanks to Joe (Jaw) from Rossendale we all enjoyed the amazing cocktails. Try the Smokey Old B****rd in a jam jar and The sling in a Penthalagon's perfume bottle. Remember though this all comes at a cost. $1500 sgd., for four with wine is what we spent. Would I go again? Yes of course I would
5
Personalised service. Immediately hello and here's your table. They take my handbag to stow it behind my chair, flick my napkin onto my lap and offer to serve us water and drinks.We had the set meal of two courses and two of the three of us ordered desserts. What do I recommend? Everything.What was it? I can't remember, fish I've never heard of, vegetables I've never heard of, shapes I've never seen before. We all want to go back again as soon as possible
5
I was in November in Singapore for a business trip. With a couple of friends we 've been in this beautiful restaurant after asking to knowing people used to live in Singapore where should we gone for a nice dinner. Someone told use The Tippling could probably be the right place, we where looking for.Beautiful location, the bar with the hanging bottles is nice and fashion, the open kitchen it's clean and involved me in a magic atmosphere.The Dinner was amazing a real Food Magic Experience, all the dishes surprised me in different way and shock my taste buds…The dishes was elaborated and very well presented, every single bite was a sensual trip.Unique and beautiful experience which it will unforgettable for me…Right price and special Service.I will recommend it to everyone
5
We decided to go all out for the gourmand tasting menu with pairings. The service was excellent - friendly and attentive but not overbearing. The pairings worked really well - including a few courses with cocktails rather than wine which was really fun and unusual to see. All the dishes were good, some were stand out for us - particularly the foie gras with passion fruit paired with the gonzales cocktail, the faux risotto and the umami beef dish. It is incredibly expensive but we came to terms with what the bill would be before we booked and had a great time. I think we'll be back
4
Tippling club is a very good place. They make lots of good science food like pills that taste like strawberry cheesecake, and a very green liquid that tastes like tomato soup. Although the food is good, the bad thing about this place is that you have to wait for a long time between your courses before you get your next course and if there are lots of people in the restaurant, then your food comes even slower. I found out the hard way :( . This restaurant though is very innovative and exciting and is a must do if you ever go to Singapore.Some of the foods that they serve there are at the bottom in pics
5
Amazing dining experience, four of us had the gourmand wine pairing experience and never thought it would end!
Too many dishes to recall but every course was full of flavour and cooked to perfection .
Well worth a Long visit.
3
Not memorable. Food was very well presented but the flavours and textures where somewhat lacking. I will try again but wouldn't rush back
5
Again, not disappointed. Consistently great food and service. We got to meet the new sous chef Ayo who kept up the high standard of the Tippling Club. I look forward to our next visit.
5
Went there for a business meeting dinner- was skeptical about it in the beginning. Food was amazing. Quality, presentation and environment was superb. Its expensive but worth it.
5
We had at least 15 courses. Some just bites and the others more substantial. Each dish was carefully explained and for a fussy eater like me I enjoyed almost every course. Service was good and wine list strong. Next time with my wife
5
This was a great night out and an amazing dining experience. To be clear, this is Michelin style eating. Beautifully presented, amazing ingredients with a lot of love and attention - so it comes at a price. There are two tasting menus with or without wine pairing. We went for the smaller menu with wine pairing. This was more than enough food although there were some items on the larger tasting menu that I would have loved to have tried. Service was good although some of the dish explanations were a little rushed and there was sometimes the assumption that the diner would know all of the subtleties of the descriptions and cooking methods. Probably my lack of knowledge but good communication is all about being understood and the responsibility lies with the speaker not the listener. Chef Ryan was attentive and visited the tables. Clearly passionate about what he does.The only thing I would have suggested is a wine recommendation mid meal to compliment the existing wine pairing and food. The wine pairing was great but I could have done with a little extra :-).All in all - very well worth it
5
Came twice in one month (Dec 2015), first for business lunch then again for a lunch date. Best experience would be sitting by the bar counter and experiencing your food while seeing the action in the kitchen. Food is exceptional from amuse bouche to desserts. Look forward to a private dining experience at the top floor someday! Would be nice to see a change in the starters menu
4
We hopped by The Tippling Club for drinks and finger food on a Friday evening. The ambiance is warm and inviting and the staff friendly and welcoming. We had a Purple Drank and a Whisky to drink, and the Halloumi & Brie Sandwich to eat. The cocktail was interestingly presented - in a bottle of cough syrup! It was mixed really well with the raisin and vanilla blending beautifully with the citrusy undertones. The finger food was passable, but the overall experience more than made up for it
5
My husband and I decided to try the Gourmand tasting menu and it was a little too much. The food is fantastic, imaginative and bursting with flavours but the length of service is much too long. We are both very restless and sitting in a restaurant for 3 hours is a first. Even if you have a very big appetite the Gourmand option may still be too much to handle. I would recommend this place to anyone visiting Singapore and looking for a new and original culinary experience. Tippling Club and Momofuku Shōto are now my two favourite tasting menu restaurants
5
You don't go to Tippling Club because you're hungry. You go because you want to be entertained, amused, amazed and almost without realising it, you will be stuffed like the proverbial goose if you are brave enough to go for the full whack gourmand dinner. 12 snacks before you even start the meal proper. Is it too much? Yes. Is it worth doing? Oh, so very YES. I am not going to run off a list of dishes, but I can tell you, there wasn't a dud among them (except maybe one...). I have eaten here before and I do think that the focus has become clearer, the dishes more pared back, less fussy and that is a very good thing. Now all we have to do is sit back and wait for those stars..
5
Service at the level of a three star european restaurant. Price for a full service meal wine included is high but acceptable
5
At about $60 per person plus some wine (and the wine list is reasonable) Tippling Club may be the best value high end lunch in town. I am shocked that this place is listed at number 60. Just try it!
5
With a solid menu, executed perfectly, I will definitely be returning to the Tippling Club. As the name suggests cocktails are a highlight. A great overall experience; ambience, service, food and drink.
5
This restaurant is one of the best I have ever been to. We sat at the bar looking into the kitchen and watched with fascination as the chefs prepared the meals. If you are a foodie you can't miss this place.
5
I had a wonderful experience at Tippling Club. Every dish I ate was of the same very high standard, delicious and beautifully presented - I was a particular fan of the beef with horseradish burrata, just stunningly good. Moreover the menu is full of surprises - a succession of snacks before the meal even starts included a very cool 'lava lamp' soup, and another sequence of pre-dessert snacks included a little jar of 'cheesecake pills.' Seriously good food combined with a wonderful sense of playfulness
5
This was my second visit, four years after the first. I extended my trip in order to eat here and I was not disappointed.The food is out of this world, the flavours, the presentation, the passion and the creativity put this restaurant on a different plane.Ryan Clift, the chef patron is an approachable modest guy with a passion for his food. The open kitchen and plain wood tables gives a welcoming atmosphere. I particularly like the fact that the chef who prepared our food brought ti to the table in person.I am not going to pretend that this is a cheap restaurant, especially if you go for the 10 course taster menu as we did with matching wines, but it was worth every penny.I can't share the flavours with you but I can share some of the pictures of the food. The "plates" I use the term loosely, are all works of art in themselves; and that's before the food goes on. (The pictures are not in the sequence the dishes were served)I am already thinking about when I can return to Singapore for another gastronomic adventure
5
I went to Tippling Club with a business associate and was so satisfied with the food, service and ambience that I'm taking my wife there tomorrow. We were served two amuse-bouche. I had the two-course meal - the smoked eel and salmon. All presented very well and cooked to perfection. The attention to detail was fantastic. Overall a great experience. If you go there as a couple, ask for the table by the window. It seats two and is just nice
5
Our experience in Tippling Club was a lucky mistake as we were looking for a trendy bar to have a couple of drinks before dinner. Without booking and once seated in the bar we had the options of two menus. The first one was gourmet but conventional so we opted for the second possibility, more risky but where clearly the chef put all his creative and technical skills.The experience is fantastic and full of magic. If you consider all the appetizers, it will be a display of 20 very well designed dishes. Every course is visually attractive, with innovative flavors and the most important technically well executed. Expensive? Yes! But the experience will remain as you are putting in your mouth pure talent. Ryan Clift is by sure one of the greats
5
Tipping Club is simply one of my fave restaurants in SG. It's unpretentious vibe, stunning food both in terms of flavour and presentation, makes it hard to beat.It doesn't come cheap but weekday lunch sets are reasonably priced especially with the freebie snacks u get. Chef Ryan is a master at combining great flavours with unique and often too-pretty-to-eat presentations. While it's nice to have a good chat with company at the lunch table, my fave spot really is at the open kitchen table counter where u can see all the action happening in front of u. I must say its always nice to see all the mastery behind the presentation. Make sure u book before and I'm sure u will leave feeling very satisfied on many fronts
5
Being in Singapore to visit friends, we had a birthday during the stay. We made a reservation in this restaurant for diner and it was wow, wow, wow. Very creative kitchen with surprising dishes, all very nicely presented and delicious. This is a great restaurant and the cocktails are super super original and great.We would go back with every stay in Singapore. This is worth Michelin stars!
5
Low key hipster atmosphere with world class innovative food.
The wine list is predictably bad value. Surprisingly the service was terrible. The waitress had a serious attitude problem.
5
We all loved the 10-course gourmet menu. I had the vegetarian with no wheat and they did a spectacular job creating a great experience and flexing for my food requirements. The service and presentation were excellent. We will most certainly go back!
5
Amazing dinner though a little bit pricy. Foods are fantastic and services are good. Highly recommended and must try if you wanna have an unforgettable experiences in SG.
4
We came to Singapore for holiday and decided to try one of the best restaurant in here. We chose Tippling Club for our lunch. The place was nicely decorated.
They have 3 courses menu with some extra freebies to start.
The cocktail is great.
4
Went there for a night out with friends and a few drinks.
Love the atmosphere. Not very crowded, friendly staff and simple bar menu.
5
Tippling Club succeeds on all levels! Food is tasty, creative and fights the boundaries. Service is top level. Cocktails are top level. Great wine selection. One of the top 20 restaurants in Asia!
5
Really innovative, attentive and creative. A culinary experience that is worth the effort and stomach! Keep it going.
This is worth Michelin anytime!
5
A real gastronomy gem - the food is creatively designed and the presentation is all art! Literally blew us away all the time. The lunch set is a great steal if you don't want to rob your wallet for the tasting menu for dinner. Cocktails are award winning here, in addition to the wine offering. You would fall in love with their bar decorations!ã€

Let me preface this by saying, I've just returned from an overseas holiday (Japan, to be precise) and the immaculate level of service there is still fresh in my mind...I've been Tippling Club when it was at its Dempsey Hill location, there was something about the ambiance (maybe it's because it's a larger bad counter) and vibe/buzz that it had which I preferred over their new Duxton home. I started off mentioning service first. Their service was okay but could be better. Few things stick out in my mind that I would've expected from a place of this calibre, is it a deal breaker? Not so much, but it would've been nice to have ...- Wines by the glass : after we placed the order, the waiter brought us the bottled, showed it to us, poured the glass - we both expected for them pour a tasting portion to see if it was corked, and then proceed. As I said, not a deal breaker, but was a little caught off guard! On the same note, we both finished the glass of wine, the glass was cleared from behind us, and hey, I half expected them to ask if I wanted another? Again, was just caught of guard.. - menu/food : we had the gourmand 10 course, food was good, I might not be used to the chef's style and it could be the seasonal ingredients, but I felt the dishes were a bit heavy handed and on the salty side. I was looking for some lighter fresh flavours on the plate to balance and "cut" the saltier / umami flavours. Memorable dish: razor clams soup, the parsley was a nice refreshing surprise. - service : I've been reading previous comments about service being exceptional. It's not bad. But exceptional sets quite high expectations and you would expect one level more than the basic needs of refilling water, changing cutlery and not being rude..(maybe vs other restaurants in Singapore it can be...) Seated at the bar counter, we were in clear view of the kitchen. The restaurant wasn't overwhelmingly busy, there were still many empty tables. I didn't finish my cheese course, in fact I nibbled at it (only because I felt it was too salty for me and needed some sweetness for balance), my plates were cleared with no questions asked...this continued to happen throughout the dessert courses and not one waiter/sous chef batted an eye. I would've expected some query/concern from the team of why the hard work they had put into the dish was not eaten up fully...bar counters create and are more conducive for a more interactive environment but it didn't happen...it's not bad service, I could be expecting a lot. While having this meal, I found myself comparing the experience with my time at Andre. For a similar price point, tasting menu experience, I preferred Andre for its experience and their service was on point. Understand that they're not serving the same cuisine...As I said, I had high expectations going in, it was good, but could be better..

A group of 4 of us had dinner and opted for the 5 course set menu (the only choice is 5 or 7 courses). The food is really good and quite creative too. We had the match drinks and they came out after the meals were served on nearly every course. That was a bit frustrating as the drinks are meant to compliment the food and on at least 1 course the food was finished before the drink s arrived. The service was good.I have been for lunch and its a set menu too, with a lot of the same courses, but the pricing is so much cheaper for just as good food, I struggled to justify the huge change in pricing from daytime to night time dining

A must try for a food adventure. The Cocktails are innovative. The vibe is cool.
Its Great to eat this kind of food in such a relaxed environment. I love sitting at the kitchen bar.
5
This place is a 'foodie's paradise'! Pricey...but worth it! Words cannot describe the Tippling Club experience! You must go for yourself.
5
Such a brilliant place. The cocktails were delicious & so innovative. We loved the Satorical & the Fig side car, which had freeze dried mandarins on it ( these were gorgeous!) The staff couldn't be more helpful or attentive. One of the bar men gave us a list of other great bars to try. Go!
5
We were greeted very pleasantly by the team and walked through a side room with tiny tables, and then on to what I think were the best seats in the house, the bar in front of the kitchen. We saw everything going on and had the opportunity to chat to the staff and the head chef Paul.My wife and I believe it to be the best meal we have ever had. We went for the Menu Gourmand together with matching wines (or drinks I should say, because many were not wines but actually cocktails). We started with 'snacks' that turned out to be 7 individual dishes served one at a time with a glass of vintage Krug (thanks Chris)....that was one glass of Krug to go with seven dishes. That was followed by a further 14 dishes each served with its own unique drink, some a cocktail and others unusual wines from Spain and indeed a sparkling sake.We were totally blown away with the level of precision, creativity, preparation, detailed presentation and the fact that the dishes were served by the chef that had prepared them. These were brilliantly creative dishes, and then add in the unique drink with each that somehow managed to be precisely the right accompaniment. WOW!!Chefs served the food whilst Waiters kept the drinks flowing - the timing between the two working seamlessly so that each dish had the right drink at the right time (14 times). We want to go back because we want to experience it all again as almost too much to take in during one visit.BTW expensive but worth it !
5
This place is absolutely amazing....The menu is just an endless suite of dishes with extraordinary flavours, served with a lot of passion and extravaganza. Your food will be served with selected wines (some of them better than others) and even a few surprising cocktails.The staff is extremely profesional
5
Superb from beginning to end. Too bad that there was ended. Everything from the decor, staff and especially the food and the wonderfully pleasant owner and chef. I will certainly go back next time I will visit Singapore .. This is a must restaurant if you like the food and service at a high level. Thanks for a great experience ..

3rd time of visiting. Took my parents and 9 year old daughter. 10 plate simply wonderful. 5 plate enjoyed by all.The chef makes it memorable.The staff extremely nice.Pairings delicious all the way through.Our favourite.....it has some name. But it looks like a poo on a plate......simply the best

I just love food that looks too good to eat and when you eat it you're also pleasantly surprised by the freshness and quality of the food. We went for the ten-course set menu and they actually give you a whole bunch of complimentary snacks to start. Though I did find it quite a nuisance to be told that the whole table will need to go for the same set menu, when there was only two sets available I thought they should be a little more accommodating. The food was well prepared, strong flavors in most dishes, the presentation was immaculate top off with the fact that the staff will explain to you every dish. I went for the wine pairing and they don't just pair with wine but a wide range of wines from different regions, sake, and cocktails and WOW their cocktails are the best that I have had in a very long time. So even if you don't try their dinner you can always just go enjoy the bar and their amazingly innovative cocktails. Overall I had a great evening slightly ruined by a not so friendly waitress who thought being rude is the new chic, but I was willing to overlook and still give it a five stars as this place has got many other raving qualities. Well deserved their title as Asia's top 50 restaurants - innovative fusion cuisine, amazing cocktails and great ambience. I'll definitely be back on those special occasions as you'll be prepared to pay about SGD 400/head with drinks.

Only a few days ago, a friend asked me to recommend a fancy place to go to in Singapore. Without hesitation I said go to Tippling Club, I loved it. And then I remembered that I had forgotten to review it, so here goes:We stumbled upon Tippling Club, based on a conversation with friends some weeks earlier. We had heard of the place, we knew it had relocated, we just had not been there. We studied the menu and booked lunch.TC is housed in an old building, completely remodelled insider, preserved on the outside. First impressions were good.We chose to sit on the bar stools looking at the kitchen, allowing us to watch the chefs prepare everything.We were guided into our menu selection by the friendly and knowledgeable restaurant manager. We subsequently spent time with him discussing Melbourne as it turns out he is also from Melbourne. Later on, we discovered that the head chef is also from Melbourne. (Small world.)The food quality and the food presentation were faultless. I will focus on what my wife had - she went for the vegetarian banquet. It was great. I even tried a few things off her plate. I did not touch the dessert but it was some sort of mandarin flavoured cake which looked beautiful. (It was a while ago so I do not 100% recall what it was.) My meal was also excellent, coming with some very interesting small tasting plates.The wine was OK but the other drinks were great. I forced myself to try an English ginger liqueur of some sort (I loved it) and an American pear brandy (which I also loved.)All in all, a great place, great staff who are exceptionally helpful, good feeling, great vibe

I've eaten out at a lot of restaurants, and it's not often something comes along that is completely different to what I've experienced before. So Tippling Club was not only a pleasant surprise, but an absolute revelation. From the moment you enter, you know that you're in for a treat. The decor is brilliant - just on the right side of trendy, casual and cool. The funky music adds to the ambience, and the bar beats most you'd find in London - a unique set-up with a truly inventive cocktail menu that sets the standard for the quality here.Tippling Club excels in a tasting menu, best enjoyed at the kitchen bar where you can be right in the hub of the action. The chef here is inventive and fearless - and the dishes will blow you away, one by one. It's worth going for the full on menu because you just won't want this epic gastronomic journey to stop. Foodies - this is one for you
5
This place seemed like a local hotspot. Elegant with a hip vibe. Really liked the decor and the bottles 'suspended' over the bar. Kitchen wasn't open late, but the place is in Chinatown so if you can always grab a bit nearby before/after some drinks.
5
we heard lots of good stories about tippling club. innovative cocktails and spot on each time. thanks kamil. we paid $60 for 2 cocktails. will come back to try the food.
4
Really good food. Good cocktails. The pairing wine it's also really good. The staff also amazing. Good music!!!!
3
Even if we enjoyed our dinner, the whole experience was a bit disappointing. I expect more on this range of prices.
5
Lovely surprise ..beautifully presented, spectacularly flavored food.From the multiple amuse bouches to the final deserts, the chef ,Paul Gajewski, excelled.Entries of Hot and Cold Vitello Tonnato and Kingfish Carpaccio, followed by Slow roasted Pork Collar , accompanied well chosen house wines, made this a memorable lunch.This lunch alone was worth a Singapore visi
5
We went for the 10 course tasting menu but opted out of the drinks portion choosing instead to order a bottle of wine. Started with 3 (or 4) "snacks" each one delicious and a work of art. Each taste treat was visually beautiful, artfully displayed and phenomenal to taste. We couldn't wait for the next course to arrive! We thought 10 courses might be too much, especially with all the snacks, but we left satisfied but not stuffed. The waitstaff was attentive and described each course as it arrived. I would have liked to have more details in writing so I could take some time to appreciate what I was eating. So much to take in! We loved it
5
Went there to drink with my friends. The drinks are amazing, creative and unique. The staff is very nice, they're very attentive. The place is also great. Try the peanut butter and jelly cocktail, you won't regret it. Price is quite expensive but it's totally worth it. Highly recommended
5
The food is out of this world, truly amazing. We were stunned and wowed with every course. The attention to detail and the tastes were incredible. I'd really recommend this place for anyone who wants to experience fine dining at it's best. We really liked the dishes being brought over to us by the chefs so you can ask questions if you have any. The service is also brilliant. The cocktail menu has an amazing selection. We tried the PJ&B and it was so good! I'd definitely go back just to hang in the bar trying the cocktails
5
Come here for the cocktails. The bar is small, but full of light at happy hour from windows on the front and side of the old shop-house. The decor is a wonderful mix of modern, hundred-year-old industrial, and bright green upholstery. The bar features a ceiling adorned with liquor bottles hanging from hooks - hundreds of them in a creative display. The bar-tender was a great professional bar-tender, who made me two excellent and creative drinks. They were made with precision and care. There is some food on a small menu - but who cares - come here for the cocktails
5
I had lunch here earlier in the year and was really looking forward to returning with friends for dinner.Once again the food and dining experience was outstanding. The staff are friendly and knowledgeable.I would recommend sitting at the counter overlooking the kitchen. It's not great for the level of conversation with your friends as you find yourself mesmerised by the level of teamwork and pride in presentation
3
Food and services were average during my first visit. However, I think this place have more potentials and will try again to have a second judgement.
4
This is by far my favorite place for a quiet date night, or drinks with partner or friends. Service is excellent with the friendly staff. My seat is always outdoors so I can smoke and people watch over a few sartorial and CHATEAU YUGNES!
5
Love it, from start to end, full of surprises. My husband and I loved this experience!
A must to do !
3
First up, I like this place, but sorry to say it would not survive in Europe or America. An expensive menu that has never changed. So on your third visit it becomes tiresome. Still would recommend someone new
4
This is our first Tippling Experience, and we were blown away by the food, ambience and service. They only serve tasting menu for dinner, and we can choose between Classic or Gourmand. The first 7 snacks prepared us for the gourmand journey and the courses were simply amazing... The Pre Desserts and Dessert Finale are the perfect closing to our dinner in Singapore before we fly back to Jakarta..
5
I usually come here for lunch and decided on dinner this time. Opted for the 5 course instead of 11. The "snacks" that precede the 1st course were interesting . 1st course of smoked eel was good. 2nd course of onion soup with scallops is better. The fish and pigeon courses were good too. Dessert of milk was probably my favorite with the soup Overall the dishes were plated beautifully I had 1 of their famous cocktails before the meal and it wasn't all that grea
5
if i died and went to heaven, i want heaven to be like this. smoky, full of flavour, taste, color, total satisfaction. i decided to treat my girl friend to lunch yesterday. a belated birthday lunch. as we did not have a reservation and the restaurant was fully booked, the only seats were at the counter. Tippling has an open kitchen concept and it was such an experience to sit and watch the chef and his staff do their thing. the presentation is simply amazing and the starters were yum. i think we were in awe of the presentation, we hesitated to devour it. we had a 2 course set lunch. the wait staff are attentive and friendly, and when the dish was served, they explained what it was.... so definitely worth the visit
5
Dined at the Tippling Club last night. We enjoyed ten creative, delicious courses. Such an experience to be able to watch the creative, enthusiastic chefs at work. The chef that prepared the course explained what we were eating. Really friendly attentive staff which made the evening enjoyable. A food experience!!!
5
Trendy cocktail bar located on the outskirts of Chinatown. Staff are really trendy, friendly and knowledgable. When our cocktails and late night desert came to out table it was all explained what was in it!! And boy it was good. My recommendation is the Buenos Dearos...wow!
5
I went to the tippling club restaurant because my boyfriend (who works as a chef in a 2star restaurant in Germany) heard about it before. Our reservation was confirmed straight away, so you are able to plan your evening quite soon. When we arrived there the restaurant was not that full (didn't change during the night tho) it's a casual, relaxed atmosphere as in 'normal' on the one hand but on the other hand the service treats you with a lot of attention so at that point you can really see that you sit in a higher quality restaurant. The food is served by the chefs thereself with an explaination of each plate - I really liked that so you get to know who's behind the food you eat. Moreover its an open kitchen right next to the bar, you can actually see the chefs cooking, The food itself was very good - you can see a lot of creative creations, diversity of tastes and unexpected combinations. EVERYTHING tasted good and special!The only thing what I didn't like thaat much was the cocktail we had as aperitif - way to strong for my taste.You can either choose from the big menu (11 courses) or the classic one (6courses) and if you would like to have it with a cheese course or not. Furthermore its up to you if you wanna have your meal accompayning beverage (wines) or not.We've choosen the classic menu, with the cheese plate and the wines. Before our first course was served we got a couple of snacks such as a truffle craker, kind of baked pepper witth wasabi foam, and basil tomato oil/ gazpacho, ... (not that simple of course but the basic ingrediants were these ones) and even after our normal dishes as described in the menu we got some unexpected "pre desserts" which were coming in quite a funny way (but I don't really wanna explain here because than it's no suprise anymore)The wines were really nice as well, most of them coming from europe.My personal highlight was the birthday surprise coming for me after the dessert (their own interpretation of birthday treat - selfmade cereals with strawberry ice cream and of course a candle on top)All in all it's of course not the cheapesst place to eat in SG but definately worth the money and compared to other restaurant on that level even with a good pricing I would say.Can recommand it for sure
5
I love Tippling club!!! They serve the most amazing food ever!!! Apart from their main courses, they usually serve starters which is not in the menu. Bite size starters which are nice but not filling. At the end of the starter, they will serve a tomato like drink to help clear your palette. Oh, not forgetting their cocktails!! Smokey old bast*** (apparently not allowed in Trip) is my hub's fav! It's a male drink I must say. Tippling has quite a variety of cocktails which u must try.
5
I was at Tippling on June 29 with 2 associates for lunch. My first time there.You'd have difficulty eye-balling the place from the outside. You have to pay attention to the address. Very discreet and non-descript entrance at the end of a row of shophouses in Tanjong Pagar.Inside, the vibe is really cool. Great bar for a pre or post drink. Ambience snd decor is chic and hip. Open kitchen provides a homely warmth. The staff is helpful and attentive. And the chef comes to explain the gastronomic creations as they are served.We opted for the set lunch and i am afraid i cannot recreate here the series of small dishes that came in succession...creatively presented (e.g. White rice crispies served on top of a styro slab) and an interesting combination of ingredients and flavors. Their version of tom yang kun soup was refreshingly different. I had the salmon for a main and it was very well done, crisp and firm on the outside but soft and tender inside. It was accompanied by a side if veg. Dessert was a souffle that was so light and absolutley chocolate-y! Then we ended on a olate of petit fours. The portions were just right for a light and remarkable lunch.This was truly a must-visit-again place. It made the Tippling point
4
Heavenly food experience starts with the bar cocktails - all esoteric, well explained & palate stimulantsFood never finishes with 9 course taster - plus snacks & sweets thrown in - 14 courses in all!Each course puts your taste buds in orbit, crave for more & it all changes - even the serving gadgets & cutlery strays into surgery & Galaxy.Very prompt service, story that goes with each gem and watch the chefs cook & then serve/chatWine prices are prohibitive & borders on being sillyPrice tag a touch too high - the overall experience makes it worthwhile Once up a time in Singapore..
5
A chef friend from Melbourne insisted that we had to go to Tippling Club while in Singapore. We didn't have a lot of spare time so we decided to go for lunch and we're very glad we did.When making the booking the staff member advised that the only seats available were at the counter. We weren't sure what this meant but as long as we could get in we were happy to sit anywhere. Once we were seated I was very happy as the left hand end looked directly onto the kitchen where all the action was. We were able to see the meals being prepared and interact with the chefs. One of them happened to be the head chef Paul.We really enjoyed being able to chat with Paul and ask him questions about living in Singapore and running a restaurant where most things need to be brought in.We had the 3 course lunch and got a taste of what Tippling Club has to offer. We thought the food was outstanding. All of the dishes were beautifully presented and delicious.We thoroughly enjoyed our time at Tippling Club. The food and service were excellent and sitting at the counter just added to the experience. Thank you Paul for a fantastic lunch and for helping us get in to another restaurant for lunch the following day. I look forward to returning in August where I have already made a dinner booking and am taking some friends along
5
Dropped in here with a friend and sat at the bar for cocktails and a selection of "bar snacks"... would love to go back and try the full menu!Lets start with the cocktail menu... I did, and its pretty impressive, but better still ask the guys to go off-piste and mix you something of their own choosing, really good!Then set about the bar menu, perhaps not the cheapest way to eat in Singapore, but a very tasty range of bites,but you'll want 2-3 as a meal replacement, and out of shear greed you might want another!Ambiance is also fantastic, with a well renovated period property in the Chinese quarter, this would be a good place to meet friends or launch a bigger night from.Enjo

Visited Tippling Club for their set lunch and the wife and I loved it! Had a cocktail which arrived in a medicinal bottle with a paper box packaging, very intriguing but most importantly it tasted fantastic. All the dishes were delicious and beautifully plated, i especially liked the Smoked Eel appetizer and the Pumpkin Tom yum soup. This place personally ranks as one of the best restaurants in Singapore and i am looking forward to returning for their dinner service
5
Brilliant, innovative, delicious, and fun!!! One of the best dining experience I've had in Singapore for a while. Fine dining in Singapore is not cheap but very often, the food and services seldom live up to expectations. Tippling Club not only serve delicious and innovative food but backed up with friendly and experienced service staff. We went for the 10-course meal which is more than enough food as they are complemented with small dishes throughout the meals. Definitely worth a repeat visit.
5
I think this is by far the best restaurant I have ever eaten in Singapore. The restaurant serves 2 degustation menus for dinner.. A classic one (with 5 courses) and an optional addition of a cheese platter and a gourmand one with (10 courses).. We were floored already when they were just serving up snacks which wasn't even part of the 10 courses for the Gourmand menu... Each snack and each dish were so innovative crafted and every dish just presents itself as a unique combination of flavours from all over the world.. Its just an eclectic mix of flavours from indian, japanese, european cuisine...There's definitely use of molecular gastronomic techniques but there were really complementary to the taste.. not overdone.. Service was also absolutely delightful. It is very adequately staffed and you won't need to exert too much to get some attention. Ambience was lively and vibrant.. Although the price was a steep.. understandably so.. though of course, I think one who finds reasons to enjoy food and a culinary experience wouldn't quite min
5
I had so much fun at this restaurant..I dined here twice and it was AMAZING both times. Your food is paired with cocktails which is super fun and way more exciting than your average wine pairing...make sure you get a seat at the bar as you'll get to see the mixologists doing a few tricks right in front of you
5
This restaurant is world class. The unique combination of amazingly creative food, fine wine and fantastic service is an absolute must try and in my opinion puts this restaurant at the very top of the list. Every tasting dish that is placed in front of you satisfies one tastebuds to an amazing high. Always will return to the Tippling Club
4
I haven't dined here yet- only had drinks several times. I like the quaint decor- small bar with bottles hanging from the ceiling. The bartenders can customize and recommend drinks based on your preferences. Good place to take visitors for pre/post-dinner drinks.
5
Don't often enjoy lunches that much as I did on this one at rippling club with my wife. Great value and for me one of the better places for lunch (business or casual)
1
I went here tonight with a friend for her birthday & left feeling very disappointed. The waiter who greeted us was rude & obnoxious & the drinks ridiculously over priced. Don't waste your time here-absolute rubbish!
1
This restaurant was, by far, the biggest disappointment I have experienced in a 5 star establishment. It has rave reviews and I am unsure why. The ambiance is very rustic, solid timber tables etc. It is a scene you would expect in a cafe or casual tapas restaurant. There is a bar near the entry and bathroom so you need to edge through a packed crowd to get in and then again to use the bathroom. The service was among the worst I have experienced. When we asked if one of the four could have the 5 course instead of the 10 course she scoffed and said she isn't sure if the chef would allow it... and still stood there. Hey, rules are rules and this type of dining is experienced a certain way, but how about some common respect and 'service' from service staff? After we asked twice she left and returned looking accomplished and said he said no.So we all ordered the ten course. We then ordered a round of cocktails to start... I asked for a caprioska and was told it wasnt on the menu... Again, after asking 3 times she went to check and I was actually allowed to have my drink.The food started coming out as quickly as they possibly could. They rushed through the ten courses like we had a time allowance making it far from the relaxing degustation we expected. To top it off it was as if the plates were dumped in front of us, then the waiter would mumbled what it was... We asked him to repeat it at least once with every course and gave up in the end. Not entirely his fault, as the noise level was high coming from the other tables and the 'pub' at the front of the restaurant.The food was average at best. The Foie Gras was the worst I have ever tasted. If you could buy frozen Foie Gras injected with fruit conserve then thaw it the night before, that's what it would have tasted like.To top this whole experience off, the last three courses were consumed with a waiter talking to a table 3 metres away dropping the F bomb at the top of his lungs at least 20 times in an English accent.I am no prude and swear with the best of them, but where is the professionalism in this place. The bill for 4 people with two of the cheapest bottles of wine on the menu was $1,800. At that price I expect a little better than the local pub. The sommelier is definitely the only part of this experience that was up to standard. He was knowledgeable and the service was good.Overall, just dont go. It is a wast of time and money. There are much better restaurants in Singapore of a better class and quality.

Having been impressed with their bar snacks and drinks on previous occasions, and always meaning to come back for the tasting menu, we finally ventured to the Tippling Club this weekend for hubby's birthday and what a treat it was! To start, our palates were delightfully teased with interesting snacks such as a deconstructed chicken curry with crisp rice pops in individual jars, a truffle styrofoam crisp and a perennial favourite of ours- the blackened chargrilled peppers. Accompanied by our choice of smokey whiskey cocktails, the individual courses were perfectly executed - with the hand-dived scallops with purple garlic, foie gras with gluwine bubble reduction and on pointe kangaroo, the absolute star dishes of the night. The Aero interpretation with port jelly globules was a perfect finish to a brilliant meal.Not only was the food very noteworthy but the service across the board was impeccable - unstuffy, friendly and exceptionally accommodative to our request for additional courses and also included a special treat for the birthday boy. As we mentioned to our lovely server, Francita, we will definitely be back soon

What a surprise I had when i rushed in to meet my friend at this woody colonial style restaurant right at the end of Singapore's Chinatown. An old building, sensitively and cleverly renovated with several stories and levels to choose from. Although it was lunch time, we opted for the lower level with the beautiful bar- a magnificent ambience. The food was a surprise too, everything was perfect and a great surprise, as coming from BAli, i hadn't heard about it. Everything was pleasing, and our short lunch passed all too quickly! Highly recommended for lunch or dinner - or a quiet tipple in the late afternoon
4
My friends and I were here for lunch and opted for the 3 course set menu. It is really very inventive and value for money considering the work and effort behind the canapÃ©s and pre desserts up till the petit fours that were additional on top of the set menu. Was very impressed by the dishes presented as the flavours were balanced, but very different from usual. We were seated at the counter and witnessed all the actions, truly an experience. Should try this place at least once in your lifetime in Singapore... You won't be disappointed
5
Both I and my husband have had lunch here separately and both of us loved it. The dishes are innovative(especially the 3 surprise starters) - they dont only look good, but also taste amazing. The individual quantity looked small but we were very full after the meal.I would definitely recommend and will go back
4
I had no expectations but that they specialized in tasting menus & cocktails. First off: the decor is fun & none too stuffy. Second: there's a tasting menu paired with cocktails. Yes please! The brief of it: there were quite a few inventive home runs on menu & a couple slightly wide of the mark. If you're after a fun take on a molecular tasting menu - The Tippling Club is a good (but super pricy) bet. That tasting & cocktail paring will reach close to S$1k for a couple.

Read so many wonderful things about this place, and while the food was good, the experience itself was severely dissatisfying and extremely overpriced. We did the classic degustation for two, along with all the 'extras' that failed to impress and would ultimately surmount to a hefty $1000 bill. Staff, for the most part, were less than friendly and engaging, and the atmosphere was dire at best - throw in a nearby altercation between the chef and maitre d' and our evening ended with a less than pleasant aftertaste.Expect to pay a LOT for very little
5
Good ambiance for romantic dinner. Not a lot of choice for food but the food we ordered tasted heavenly.
I am not surprise when they say, "There is always space for desserts." Their dessert is a must try!
4
we like the food here - it is imaginative and well thought through. the ambience is nice and service is great. i would have given it a 5* if the cocktails were better, a little sweet for my liking.
5
Excellent casual fine dining with a great relaxed atmosphere. Food was interesting, unusual and very good. Great evening
4
Set amongst a charming backdrop this noteworthy enterprise delivers on all fronts.
The carte is intricate and thoughtfully assembled coupled with a sterling beverage list, majestic!
5
Plain and simple - I hate places that are too trendy as so often they end up disappointing - and so many people raved about this place for so long that I thought it could never meet expectations. I was wrong. The lunch is good value for excellent food with a few nice surprises to round it out. I can't wait to go back.
5
We accidentally came upon this restaurant after trying to go to lunch at another restaurant on Tanjong Pagar Rd and finding that restaurant closed. The Tippling Club looked cute from the outside and appeared to be busy, so we decided to give it a try. We were sat at two stools at the bar overlooking the kitchen. The hostess apologised that there were no tables available, but we soon found that the bar was the best place to sit and were quite happy to be there. We sat mesmerised watching the kitchen staff preparing the food. You know you are in a nice restaurant when they allow you to watch the food preparation. We ordered a three course lunch, but we were given several additional surprise courses at no additional cost. All of the food was absolutely excellent. When the kitchen staff would give us a course, they would provide a nice explanation of the food, which added to the feeling of being given a quality service - and a sense that the kitchen staff really cared about the food they were preparing. This was one of the best meals on our trip from Singapore to Hong Kong, especially based on value.
5
Reading a review about the best 50 restaurant in Asia, I found out the Tippling Club. The location is very nice, fresh, smart. I would say a relaxing atmosphere. We have chosen a lunch menu for an incredible price 43 $$. We were served 3 different appetizers as chef’s welcome: Singapore curry (really good and crunchy), the red pepper with the soy cream (very good balance) and the basil/oil drink (fresh and very very smart). I chose the scallops as entrée and the friend of mine the terrine foie gras. Everything was very really executed. I had the kale risotto that was really a masterpiece, the best dish served. My friends had the lamb and a fish dish that was both of them very good. We finish with the mango dessert and goat cheese. If I come back to Chicago, surely I will go back to this restauran

Situated on Tanjong Pagar, at the entrance of Duxton Hill, this small hip bar is packed with locals even on week nights.Very popular with trendy young people and expats, they serve amazing cocktails. Prices are comparable to most other bars of similar category. Service is quick and the staff are very clued into the concoctions that make the cocktails. Great place if you like to try something refreshingly new

The food was very creative and imaginative. I have enjoyed some "molecular gastronomy" style restaurants but sometimes the concept gets in the way of the flavour.Some dishes here were excellent but some i found difficult to finish, perhaps i could not understand the flavours. overall a nice place, i would go back with friends for the drinks and I am certain a chef like that has his good and bad days

We came here one night and both my husband and I ordered the 5-course classics instead of the 10-course Gourmand. My husband had two glasses of wine with his main. I took pictures of every dish and wrote reviews on each one as well in case anyone wonders what they look and tasted like (in my opinion). Order of serving1) three tiny portion snacks 2) Grouper carpaccio (my favorite)3) scallop soup (2nd most favorite)4) slow roasted kangaroo 5) chocolate dessert Service was great. I forgot names of two wines my husband had but he said they were good to

Great food, inventive and method savy! great skills Chef Ryan has hence he had been rewarded Top 50 Asias best restaurants. Indeed theres wow factor here but come in with a open mind and standard expectations ... think of flavours and not comparison to other restaurants .

This was very long overdue!I had dined at Tippling before, at the old location in Dempsey and since then didnt had the opportunity to try the new one in Tanjong Pagar.Well, last Friday my husband, myself and another couple finally found time to try the lunch.It was out of this world!The 3 course set menu costs $58++ and you get not only great food, but a whole experience!It starts with a warm welcome by the staff, buzzling atmosphere and outstanding dishes.Chef Ryan Clift mixes flavors with best produce, clsssic and innovative cooking methods.We all tried different things and all were superb.A MUST DO restaurant in Singapore.Thanks guys and keep it up

Once again the Tippling club did us a very nice arrangement after I forgot it was my birthday. Marcus kindly arranged for the upstairs section for us (party of 10) to celebrate and for us to show many of our family visiting just how good this was.Our guests were constantly snapping away with phones and cameras on what has become quite transitional with fine dining it seems. Lots of oohs and aahhs at the clever combination of taste, texture and visual presentationAll eloquently described before each course (8 with pairing) and enough to say we shared our favourite restaurant in Singapore with friends and family from across the globe.Upstairs felt a little away from it all. The pre drinks area is really comfortable to be in, but maybe some of the theatre of preparation that you get when sat next to the kitchen downstairs is lost upstairs. I would challenge the the art and decor upstairs does go some way to overcome thisThe pairing was extremely good with the 8 courses and the pescatarian substitutes once again surpassed my wifes expectations.Well done to Marcus and his staf

I had been on 2 week street food tour stopping in Tokyo, Bangkok, Ho Chi Minh City, and ended up in Singapore--my lunch at the Tippling Club was perhaps one of the best dining experiences I had on the entire trip.I was joined by a friend who had also been traveling with me. We both ordered the 3 course lunch set which was plenty of food along with the stunning 3 amuse-bouches.The meal was absolutely amazing, and our server guided us through the menu drawing attention to some of the stand-out dishes--her advice was perfect.Clearly you should visit the Tippling Club for the food, but equally as impressive were the staff.Upon our arrival to the Tippling Club the hostess greeted us with warm and generous hospitality, a noteworthy welcome and solid first impression. She continued checking on us throughout the meal along with a man who appeared to be the GM, and when each course was served one of the chefs accompanied our server to the table to explain what were were about to enjoy.Really, I was blown away by the attentiveness and professional courtesy of every member of the Tippling Club's team, a real indication of solid leadership.Whenever I'm back in Singapore I'll definitely hit up the Tippling Club again

Actually I was very impressed. We had the five courses plus cheese. Each one was beautifully presented (both visibly by the chefs and audibly by the waiters). And they tasted great. Didn't go the wine pairing but chose of the list. Proper fine dining but at a fine price too. Maybe once in a lifetime is as much as I can do.

got invited by my colleague who celebrated his 50th birthday. An english couple, a Finnish couple and me were the group. We were seated after the order for the wine for all and lime-soda for me were all placed. What a great start to the birthday celebration when one of the young staff started explaining the menu, five course or ten course with or without wine pairing, with or without cheese. A pleasant treat for ears to hear those little girls take you through the menu, quick in military precision. Once the order is placed, it starts with snacks, three or four types, each served in clockwork precision. Then comes the food. Like a classroom or like a cuckoo clock, the chatter birds chirp the menu served explaining the guests what has been served. A lovely thing to watch. Last but not the least, what an amazing way of presentation of food, each time different innovative serving plates or utensils, etc. The negative trend though is the pricing, I felt atleast 20% more than what it deserves in terms of value for money. In all, I enjoyed the evening at my colleague's expense who went poorer on that evening by 1538SGD, total for five guests having a five course menu. Patrons could sure go here for the splendid quality, experience but I doubt whether it could be a regular affair! Depends on how rich or how much ur budget is, that's for sure

Great food, awesome service, very knowledgable staff (a different one for each course) and very interesting wine list.Basically you choose from either a five or ten course set menu, with or without matching wines. ingredients and mixes are eclectic, but not as weird as Heston B at the Fat Duck for instance, but still surprising (stuffed carbonised green peppers with wasabi sauce anyone?) and way you go.Five courses was more than enough for a normal night out.My only gripe was that such lovely food and service deserved more than a cafe style layout in the restaurant. You are right on top of neighbouring tables.all in all very good however. Recommended

I had high hopes for the restaurant and was excited that they moved to Tanjong Pagar (more accessible for those without cars) so booked our anniversary dinner here. I was nervous b/c of the mixed reviews for this place. The place is open kitchen with large windows facing the street (which may more may not be a good thing - having people stare while you eat a $200+ dinner can be unnerving). The tables are also rather close and the atmosphere is crowded although they do a good job of keeping the noise level down. Unfortunately the woman at the table next to us complained of the AC and so they turned it down which in an open kitchen and a full restaurant means at the end of the meal, I was getting uncomfortably hot. I would suggest maybe offering a shawl to guests instead of sweating out properly dressed patrons. They offer a classic or gourmand menu and while I'm all for pigging out - the classic menu featured kangaroo and scallop instead of razor clams so we chose that instead. My partner opted for the wine pairing which was mostly Australian wines, he didn't feel that the wines elevated the food. I had a mocktail featuring thyme which was refreshing. I'd love to explore their cocktail list more in the future although the bartender told me he was revamping it. The food has molecular gastronomy techniques in it but not at the expense of food quality or quantity. I didn't appreciate that they have surcharges for caviar and truffle on the dish. It was a French caviar so we didn't choose that but did put truffle on our scallop soup. The cheese dish is also a surcharge. The reason I don't like surcharges is b/c I'm there for a tasting menu - if the chef feels this dish needs caviar, then put it on and add it on the menu charge - if he doesn't feel it's needed then don't offer it. Shaved truffles does not make everything better. The food does change so I won't go through each dish. The chefs bring out the dishes and explain the dishes well. It's evident that there is a lot of pride in the cooking. The dishes were complex and had a lot going on, but there was no dish that seared itself into my food memory. Dessert had some desiccated honey in it that really sparkled when included in a bite but there wasn't enough of it so only some bites worked. Aside from wishing us a happy anniversary, the restaurant did not do anything special for us. No written "happy anniversary" on our dessert, no mention at all which was disappointing. My partner enjoyed dinner and looked forward to a return, but I feel that for the price point and the atmosphere (not special occasion worthy) there are better places in Singapore. We left having spent $500 for 2 people and feeling comfortable but not stuffed. I ended up snacking later at home

This was our best food experience in Singapore so far. Perfect choice for celebrating our Birthday Boy. The Classic Tasting Menu with pairing was absolutely stunning! Great already from the initial snacks through each and every one of the delicious courses. We also were very charmed by the knowledgeable staff, who presented each dish in detail and were proud bearer of the Tippling Club spirit. We definitely recommend this place if you like fine dining with an extra twist! We will certainly return

I booked this place for dinner with a friend that came to Singapore for holiday. Heard raves about the expensive and pretty dishes, decided to give it a try.We ordered the 5 courses with drink pairings, and actually it isnt 5 course. There are few small items in between.The details are exquisite, edible artworks balanced of flavours. I find the amuse bouches are more enchanting than the main course, main course are quite heavy and a lil bit missed the balance.If you love your alcohol, please do the drink pairings. When combined with the food, it lift up your experience to another level.Price wise - fine dining price, but it was an experience and a fun one
5
Tippling Club is a lovely space for dinner or drinks. The staff are wonderful and the drinks I had were delicious. It was the first time I had a cocktail with black truffle and hopefully not the last.
5
One of the best in the world!
Loved everything about this place.
Every dish was like art & science on a plate!
5
It is nice to eat at an upscale restaurant that doesn't feel pretentious or stuffy. Some of the best food we have ever had, nice wine pairings, but still laid back. Mixed drinks are outstanding. Pricy but worth it.
5
Ryan Clift and the amazing team at the "Tippling Club" in Singapore are doing amazing things here in Singapore. Your eyes cannot help but deceive you as you taste the amazing dishes which are skilfully prepared and then described to you by the staff who have prepared them. Unique dish after unique dish was brought to our table on the 31st December 2014 as we drank our weight in champagne. It was a very Happy New Year ))I would beg everyone who comes across this review to book a table and try this restaurant (or is it an art gallery for food, I don't know?
5
During a stay in Singapore it's must to visit this restaurant when one loves extraordinary cooking performance . Or better the high end cuisine . In a very relaxed manner one gets spectacular courses served with excellent wines or if one wants also pairing courses with cocktails. We will come back for sure 
5
If you like molecular cooking, don't miss Tippling. Although not all the dishes were to my taste, the experience as a whole is really something out of the ordinary. Highly experienced and friendly staff. We were given seats at the bar looking into the kitchen which meant we could watch the chefs at work and engage in conversation with them. We chose the 10 course tasting menu which also includes a few complimentary snacks so if you chose this option, make sure you're hungry! An interesting dining experience to say the least
4
Have tried most of the best restaurants in the world n most in Spore so approached this visit - our first - with guarded expectations. But must say was pleasantly surprised. We took their 10 dish course - the meats n the veggie version - most of them worked. The style of food is imaginative n yet with strong flavors (none of the delicate balanced stuff here) but not over powering (ie flooded with sauces). Service is as expected from such quality restaurant: venue is small n cosy with the kitchen set real close to the dinning area. Can't comment on the wine as we don't really drink. All in all a good experience
5
The food was excellent!!! Wines very well matches to the dishes. Could not fault this restaurant. Great decor, friendly staff.The meals look so amazing you don't want to wreck them but once you start you don't want them to end as they are excellent.Love that different members from the kitchen bring out the dishes to the table. When we are next in Singapore we will be back for sure!!

My husband and I went to Tippling Club to celebrate my birthday. Based on previous reviews, I had high, but I think reasonable, expectations. We chose the gourmand menu with the drinks pairing. Normally, we are more than happy to splurge in order to experience a restaurant and its team's "vision" (plus we enjoy a good meal and well-matched drinks) fully. Unfortunately, that "vision" ended after the snacks, which I rather enjoyed, in fact. Course after course arrived along with a mumbled, not very enthusiastic explanation from the server. The food was unremarkable, though. Even when the chef himself presented us with courses, he seemed disengaged and it felt as if it were a burden for him to do anything but repeat a script . If the food were excellent, this aloofness could perhaps be acceptable. However, the only dish worth mentioning was the non-menu dessert -- which they kindly gave me because of my birthday. Put simply, the food is not great -- even at half the price. The drink pairing was a little more interesting and we enjoyed the cocktails. However, the bartender also seemed somewhat distant and uninterested. Surely it can be quite tedious to repeat the same list of ingredients over and over again -- I get that. But for SGD500+ per person, it's not unreasonable to expect genuine, sincere service commensurate with the bill total. We didn't get that. We enjoy good meals and we live in Singapore. We won't return to the Tippling Club, and we've already steered our friends away from it -- they'll be richer as a result

The tipping club continues to wow and surprise in presentation and quality of food. sat at the pass or at the table, its a unique experience for anyone who is into their food presentation, texture and excellent pairing of wine for what can be only described as the best tasting menu (and several variants) we have had.I still yearn for the rustic Dempsey Hill, hard to find location, but with this progress, it brings a full house.see you soo
5
Amazing food, service and drinks. A night out at the tippling club is an amazing adventure. It tantalizes your taste buds, makes you taste things you never imagined possible. Fyi - be ready to spend a few $$$
1
Staff was extremely rude to us. The bartender pretty much told us to order quickly or leave when it wasn't even busy. Apparently this place is already known to have rude staff - wish I knew that before. Don't waste your money here.

We went for the Gourmand tasting menu + wine pairing.The snacks that kicked off the dinner were whimsical and tasty. These probably heightened our expectations. Generally, we were not disappointed except for the Wagyu and the dessert named 'textured nuts'. The combo for the Wagyu clashed in flavours and textures - a waste of good meat. The 'textured nuts' simply lacked any flavour...a dessert that that was more like desert. Sorry!Pairing was a good concept based on diversity - wines, sake, cocktails. Unfortunately the execution can be better. The cocktails were extremely similar both in color (red mostly), and taste, and the wines were just so-so. Most of the time, the pairing did nothing to complement nor lift the dishes.Overall, certainly worth the visit just for the food. Skip the pairing

The service is very good. The tables are somehow to close to eachother but the bar at the entrance is very nice and provides comfortable atmosphere to have an aperitif drink. All food is good. You will make no mistake in chosing this restaurant in case you want eat creative and something very tasty, something good! expensive but worth spending money for. Try the Kangaroo with liquid onion rings which is slow raosted meat on rocket puree and sauteed greens braised self vinegar, together with puffled wild rice... Extraordinary art de cuisine by the head chef PAul Gajewski. Nice place for gourmet food
5
We tried the classic tasting menu which included 4 snacks, 4 savoury mains and 1 dessert. Very creative menu and every dish had amazing flavours which were well-balanced.Loved how the waitstaff were so attentive with us (clearing plates as soon as we were done, always topping up our water and telling the kitchen to hold bringing food out when one of us went to the restroom). Also appreciated that someone from the kitchen always came out to explain what dish we were about to eat. Even head chef, Paul came out a couple of times to serve us our food. We were there to celebrate my birthday and they kindly organised an extra dessert with a candle for me at the end of the meal. So lovely! Would definitely recommend this place if you enjoy degustations and enjoy trying new/creative/inventive food
5
From the minute we walked in, the experience was perfect. Quality of service, coupled with a degustation and paired wine menu that was unparalleled to anything I'd had before. So creative, so much love and attention to detail plus excellent wine list. Our night was capped off by Owner/ Head Chef, Ryan giving up his time to share a birthday drink with us after the meal. He and his team deserve to do extremely well. The Tippling Club is a must for anyone that takes dining seriously
5
We booked after reading about it in the book "where chefs eat". It's a contemporary restaurant with a small cocktail bar.We went for the 10 course taster menu with accompanying wines which came with about 7 snacks which were one mouthful unusual creations to tempt your palate.The courses that followed were incredible. Small portions of ingenious creations that set your taste buds alive, delivered to your table by the chefs who described each course. The great thing was that the 'wine' pairing wasn't just wine. Some came with cocktail creations to complement the course mixed and delivered to your table with a description by the mixoligyst. The chefs and waiting staff were informative and attentive and made our evening.This was our best meal ever. The courses were very Heston Blumenthal in style and having eaten at his Restaurant in London, I would say the Tippling Club is better.It wasn't cheap, our bill for the two of us was $1000 but it was worth it for the culinary experience.

Went here on the recommendation of a friend and we were absolutely NOT disappointed..from the pre-meal snacks of charred peppers and wasabi, the curry foam and the pallet cleanser and onto the mains.. I had the poached chicken and my wife had the lobster and both were fantastic!!! We couldn't resist but to share a dessert of chocolate orange.. We would definitely recommend for anyone not on a budget!
5
The two chefs in this restaurant used to work at the famous Vue De Monde in Melbourne. The style of food is similar to Vue and the open kitchen restaurant reminds me of Cumulus. The food is very well executed with beautiful flavours and flawless presentation. The lunch menu us superb value and they usually treat you to three free interesting snacks at the start before your meal, which is exceptional value and a lot of fun. Just go, weekday set lunch is good and been twice! Loved it! Congrats guys, great work
5
Located in an old small Singaporian house in/near China Town, this restaurant is just outstanding. Every other dish/in between dish/snack/ surprise was as exciting as the other. Moreover, the staff was very very nice. We were seated at a bar overlooking the kitchen, which we have done before. Whereas elsewhere you would witness the chef shouting at his sous chef and friends, here they were doing an amazing job while joking and thanking eachother. Also the rest of the staff was very kind. Ok, the bill was serious, but worth every penny.

Great service, creative food, nice location. Love the inspiration from pharmaceutical design (tiny bottles, etc.). Will return. Not too expensive, seen with European eyes.

I have lived in Singapore for 5 years now and have been to hundreds of restaurants here. Usually something lets them down; service, food, wine, decor, location, price - not here. Everything was simply stunning. One of the best meals I have ever had in Singapore. Tippling Club surpassed all my expectations and provided fantastic service not just by the excellent and smiley Melissa but also by the individual chefs creating the delicious courses who each delivered their creation and explained what it was. This included the very passionate and driven own-chef Ryan who was leading from the front in the kitchen supported ably by Marcus the maitre d and the whole team.The food was out of this world. The starter "snacks" were wonderfully imaginative and more importantly worked. The various courses had an incredible range of flavours and were cooked with perfection.The wine choices were great. The atmosphere and decor were relaxing and easy going while being very enjoyable.I can't fault anything, it wasn't even expensive for what we had. I have had much much worse in supposedly fine dining restaurants in Singapore and paid 3 times the price. This was all-round wonderful and we'll definitely be cominbg back and telling all our friends and business partners about this place
5
Sit at the counter and see the chefs rustle up some of the most inventive and tasty cuisine in Singapore. Wonderful quirky clever food, served in generous portions with friendly and down to earth service. Amazing cocktails too - try the Juniper Sling. Worth every penny

Authentic cocktail bars are relatively new to Singapore, especially a cocktail bar which appeals to all of our six senses!I travel and visit cocktail bars around the world as a cocktail enthusiastic and spontaneously visited the Tippling Club on Tanjong Bar Road in Singapore on a Friday early evening with a professional colleague of mine. The exceptionally unique and creative design of the cocktail bar itself, is a flavor of what is next to come as you peruse an unusually unique menu of customized cocktails.The cocktail bar space itself is small and intimate, although the adjacent restaurant space is larger and also of unique design. The descriptions of the customized cocktails will capture your attention and appeal to your senses and the exceptionally friendly bar tender will provide a personal recommendation of uniqueness. The Tippling Club is a great choice to spontaneously meet your friends, colleagues or clients and tastefully explore the menu of unique cocktails.I recommend the Rum of Rum Cocktails as a staring point for your excursion into the six senses of cocktails at the Tippling Club in Singapore
5
This is a must visit restaurant. Wonderful staff who were able to change their set menu for our allergies. Best food I've eaten in Singapore yet. Melt in your mouth kangaroo succulent fish, fantastic spices. Awesome dessert. Cocktails were fantastic also. We will be going back there
5
When you arrive at the Tippling Club it looks like a typical laid back restaurant and bar with modern decor and a lively atmosphere. It has seats at a bar looking into the open kitchen as well as conventional restaurant seating. It's only when you study the menu that its gastronomic credentials become apparent. We'd been warned when we booked that diners in the restaurant are offered a choice of two degustation menus - the 5 course classic and the 10 course gourmand - so we had some idea what to expect, but the reality far exceeded those expectations. We chose the 10 course gourmand menu and I have to say it was truly amazing! To start we got a whole succession of amuse bouche snacks that were delightfully inventive and tasty - ideal to set us up for the main event. These were followed by a succession of courses each of which were inventive, imaginatively presented and, most important, delicious. They were all so good that I find it hard to pick out a favourite, but I must say the foie gras with apple and the cured omi wagyu linger in my memory for their beautifully balanced texture and taste.I also chose the drinks flight, and this was no ordinary wine pairing. With each course I got a different glass - sometimes an interesting wine and sometimes a clever cocktail, each one complementing the food on my plate perfectly.The staff were also great. They were helpful and efficient but, more important, they were really engaging and enthusiastic about what they were doing - the whole team really enhanced the evening.Overall I thought this was a truly outstanding meal - among the best I've ever eaten. So if you're after a conventional two or three course meal, maybe go elsewhere. But If you're serious about delicious food beautifully prepared and presented and you like a laid back, casual atmosphere, this is undoubtedly the place to go - a real gastronomic heaven

We loved Ding Dong and were just waiting for an excuse to visit its big sister, which arrived in the form of a serious foodie friend who popped over for the Grand Prix. The only disappointing thing about Tippling Club is that there is ONLY a set menu and no a la carte. So if, as on our evening, you were not partial to kangaroo - a first I have to admit - then you would be in trouble. Now I don't normally eat red meat, but on this occasion had decided to go with the flow to enjoy the occasion. From the amuse bouche which included a test tube of a drink, complete with dry ice, to the scrumptious razor clams, all the way through to the deconstructed chocolate orange (via the kangaroo steak), every course was exquisitely presented and tasted like heaven on a plate. Not cheap at $160 without wine, but less than some of the other fine dining establishments in Singapore. Well worth the outlay, though perhaps only every six months or so if the menu doesnt change. I quite liked the very modern decor and public kitchen by the way

Booked in for dinner at the Tippling Club with my mum and we had an amazing meal there. The waiters and chefs were friendly and very helpful. Most of them were from Australia which was nice. As my mum was lactose intolerant they were very accommodating and altered the menu for her which was lovely! Overall a lovely experience
5
I was incredibly keen to pop into the Tippling Club because I'd already been to Der Raum in Melbourne years ago and knew that the cocktails were what I was after.But after convincing one of my friends to come with me, we got in and decided to do a degustation - because you know... it's Singapore.The meal was fantastic! The meals were fabulous and we decided to order our drinks as we went so we could select the cocktails we wanted to taste, instead of the matchings. But I'd go back again and again!Love it. One of my favourite meals ever, and definitely a top spot for Singapore right now
5
We went to the Tippling Club for the second time recently - the previous time was at Dempsey where we sat at the bar (this time was with friends). Both times we had the classic menu (the second time we added the additional cheese course). The new restaurant is a lot more modern than the old one so a bit more modern. The Tippling Club is definitely good for special occasions. Sitting at the bar makes the experience more special. The cocktails are good. The food is very good and was better the first time as some of the dishes were the same as the first time we went. The soup we has with razor clams was fantastic as was the dessert. The additional cheese course was fantastic but very tiny! The Tippling Club isn't cheap but is cheaper than some other degustation meals in Singapore and well worth trying at least once.
5
The bar in overall looks just plain amazing. The bar staff are really nice people you can chat with and they do their job properly. The choice of cocktails is rather unconventional, however very novel and tasty. Plus the staff are more than happy to give you an advice on what you should try. Someone in this thread was unhappy about the prices, but hey, it's on the tip of the CBD, plus the knowledgeable staff and overall experience definitely correlate with the prices
5
We dropped in for lunch, no booking, which apparently you don't do here :) But they fitted us in, made wine a food recommendations, all of which were excellent, and topped it all with great, friendly (but not intrusive) service. Not cheap, but treat yourself. You won't regret it.
2
Stopped in for drinks on a Friday evening. Great decor - much better then the old location in Duxton.But a bit unclear as to who they are competing with in this location - pricing and menu would say it's not the adjacent Korean BBQs and cheap n cheerful Italian - staff attitude and specialized cocktails would suggest they believe they are as good as the top end restos and bars around town - unfortunately they miss on both accounts. First step to improvement ... A little less attitude from the bar/staff - remember even if you're "right" about your drinks - but the customer walks away feeling worse then when they sat down - you're probably "wrong"!Won't be back - considering the other options for great restos / cocktails in Singapore !

This is the kind of restaurant that we personally, would go to just the once for "the experience". However, our first experience was so good, we took out daughter there for her 18th birthday as well. During our first visit I had called late due to my wife missing her flight from home and had to reschedule to a Saturday night which is very busy. The manager was most accommodating and helpful. Calling me back within the time scale that was promised and with the good news that she had fitted us in. (Thanks Stef) We had "the counter" overlooking the beautiful kitchen, and in my opinion, this is the best seat in the house. Lots of interaction with the staff who were all friendly and interested. Later relocated to the bar where new friends were made and a great night had through to the wee hours. For our daughter birthday I had requested "the counter" but was told that it was full that evening (another Saturday I think) but I explained our previous great evening at that location and as before, a promised call back within the tie scale with the good news that we had been fitted in. We had a fantastic time again met some some news friends in the bar after meal service. From our perspective we have had two great nights there where the food, although innovating, delicious and artfully presented has taken a back seat to the great vibe, even better bar, interaction and general bonhomie has made us feel right at home. Few fine dining experiences can match that

Had high expectations of this restaurant and certainly knew that the prices were amongst the highest in Singapore. While we did find the food innovative and pleasant, we found the décor, the amenities and the service did leave us a little puzzled given the sticker-price for the experience. Sitting on plastic chair for 4 hours, at a table that looks like a refugee from a public BBQ area, squashed between a wine fridge and gun barrel view of the staff polishing cutlery and glasses for most of the night made me fee I was in a mid-tier café or bistro, not a fine dining room. The wait staff were very nice and professional, but we had something like 4-5 people serving us across the evening so there was no affinity created with our table that would justify the $200 service charge we paid for. This should be a restaurant where the service, the ambience, the overall experience should be exceptional - otherwise don't charge $300/person. I want this restaurant to succeed and I think it has laid the ground-work; but, it's just that the attention to detail has let it down. Would like to return, but it's hard to justify $400 per person when there is a lot better value and experience in Singapore.

We booked this restaurant as a highlight of our trip to Singapore. At the last minute we needed to change our plans and bring our baby with us: when we informed the restaurant by email, we were told that babies were not allowed. I replied telling them that this was disappointing and was not very hospitable towards parents. I then received a response from the manager telling me that children were allowed for lunch but there wasn't enough space at dinner: apparently the space shrinks at night and babies take up so much room!! The manager also tried to put words in my mouth by saying 'we appreciate your understanding' - but no, I don't understand this appalling attitude towards parents. Why don't they say anything about this on their website? Needless to say, we cancelled our booking and went to Osteria Mozza at Marina Bay Sands, who were more than happy to accommodate us. Our baby was quiet and well behaved.I have never been turned away from a restaurant before and was actually quite angry with them

We stumbled across this restaurant by accident after a business meeting and were drawn in by the beautiful interiors. Located just off Tanjong Pagar and Duxton Road, the restaurant boasts a calming but stunning interiors dominated by an open kitchen. We thought we would just have a quick set- menu lunch but we ended up being treated to a fantastic gastronomic experience. Our three course lunch actually ended up being six courses - as the restaurant offered various amuse-bouche that tantalised our tastebuds. All the dishes were beautifully presented and the flavors were great. We loved our lunch here and can't wait to come back. 3-course set menu was about SIN$58 per head, excluding drinks. A bit on the pricey side but well worth it. Service is warm and relaxed - with the young chefs coming out to explain each dish
5
One of the best restaurants I have eaten at - creative presentation, amazing flavours, fabulous wine pairing. Watch the chefs meticulously prepare your food sitting in front of their open kitchen, and then get a personalised explanation of each course and wine match. If you want a restaurant in Singapore for a special occasion and a truly memorable experience - this is it

My partner and I love a great degustation so when we were in Singapore recently we decided to visit Tippling Club. We choose to go for the 10 course degustation (which was actually much more than that with additional snack dishes). The price is right up there, also the most expensive meal we have ever eaten, but if you love food and love trying new things then this is an amazing place to try. The staff were so amazing and explained each dish, sometimes brought out by waiters or even the chef himself which is a bit special. We were first served our cocktails, which were superb, were so delicious and made with such amazing technique they really matched the food well. Each dish was beautifully presented and made with such technique and finesse with tastes to die for. Decor and atmosphere was done really well, we hope to come back soon and bring some of our New Zealand friends with us

A chef who remains one of the best in Australia , suggested the Tippling Club for a very special event.After very careful planning, managed to arrange a booking.Depart Sydney @ 11.00 am and after a short transfer arrived @ 8.30 pm.Marcus, who must rate as be of the most affable hosts, had everything planned.Seated at the bar, course after course was ntroduced by amazing staff.A special treat of Razoe Clams with sweet Galicia, was presented with VERY genourous shavings of Black Truffle.Food was very quirky, which is exactly what I like.Staff are what sets a great restaurant apart from some of the best, and the staff were outstanding.Although had planned for smaller menu, having been traveling for 8 hours, was impressed with several complimentary dishes.The restaurant feels like a little part of Australia, with many chefs and staff from Australia.Eventually, all good things come to an end, and dinner was over.Jumped into a convenient cab, and back to the airport to get home to Sydney the next morning.The whole experience was so special, I plan on repeating in two weeks time.With careful planning, will not even need a hotel for the night.Plan on an early start, lunch at Dng Dongs, Tippling Clubs alternative restaurant, dinner at Tipplng and home for work the next day.Worth every hour spent sitting on aircrafts.Singapore is now part of my short trip destinations, if I can continue to experience this quality of food

Great food and really lovely relaxed environment with open kitchen so you can enjoy the process too. Happy fun place to eat with interesting food prepared by interesting people and matched with good wines.

food was mediocre and the choice of wine pairing was just wrong. Overpriced and left the restaurant disappointed.
5
I've eaten at fantastic places across the globe; from Michelin starred restaurants to small, cozy cafes. The Tippling Club was my favorite meal in Singapore, we went for lunch and you need to make a ressie...it's popular! Get a seat at the counter overlooking the open kitchen and watch the chefs make their magic! Service was outstanding. They do everything right at this place
5
Finally had the chance to visit Tippling Club in its new location after dining at Dempsey in the past. In the newer, larger restaurant we were able to host a group of 14 Aussies for a degustation delight - another fantastic romp through a cavalcade of flavours, textures and a little bit of culinary theatre!Ryan is about to open the upstairs area which will include an R&D kitchen, so expect some new and exciting developments on the menu.Will definitely be back next time we are in Singapore…….

Was here when it was at Dempsey and now here at its new digs on Tanjong Pagar. The parking in this area is horrible, so be preparedNice decor, with amazing looking bar, an open kitchen, bar-side seats, and normal tables, in a splash of colourThey offer you still/sparkling water, but you can ask for normal drinking water as well. I also had the house champagne and it was nice. My friend had 2 glasses of white, and they even topped up to a 3rd glass at no charge. Add 1 pointOpted for the 3 course set lunch, and it was already good value, looking at the pricing (SGD60). They actually have 3 amuse-bouche and the value goes up further. The snacks are delicious, creative and set a great tone for the dishes to comeOur starter of salmon confit was wonderfully plated, and delicious. My main of risotto was equally delicious, and my friend liked his curry-inspired fish. I had the mandarin dessert and although it was beautiful as expected, it was probably the weakest dish as the pumpkin was slightly blah. But the petit fours made up for itOverall, another excellent meal here and looking forward to return for dinner, but would have to think about how to get parking firs

this is a no-pretentious restaurant serving interesting, if only somewhat molecular, cuisine. i cannot say that i was impressed with the food. it was interesting, but not good. i am actually surprised that it was awarded a place on the top 50 restaurants in asia. the restaurant is hip and trendy. the cocktails were kinda nice
4
They moved to edge of Chinatown in a hot restaurant area and the place was well designed and intimate in size. The kitchen was open so one can see the creations as there is lot of molecular gastronomy going on. Drinks like Smoky Old ------- are truly creative but nit enough drink at Sin$ 24. The meal with all the treats is five or ten courses and frankly the 5 is enough unless you missed lunch. The food was innovative and clean albeit if you like salt and acid you will be disappointed as it is the trend now not to season much and met the ingredients sign. The eel dish was the best and the whole and the parts really sang of the plate. Pretty expensive at $125 USD for five courses so only ****. Good wine list and some steals if you know your wines. Service was superb except for one gal (sleeping with owner?) who kept primping herself in the mirror where all the customers can see....not good
4
There's a lot to like about the food here but it's not the most conducive environment to sitting back and enjoying a full-on tasting menu. There are some highlight dishes - and most of them were the amuse-bouches at the start of the meal, including an amazing 'Singapore curry'. The bar area looks like it's a lot of fun and I'd be happy to try that for a couple of drinks or snacks but there wasn't enough of a wow factor in the food to want to go back for more of the main event. The restaurant has relatively recently moved to its new spot in Tanjong Pagar so maybe it needs a bit more time to hit the mark
4
The food very good taste, presentation, originality, 10, the chef presents dishes giving you added value, also very good, but not cheap and the food is fine for the price, the only thing annoying is the type tables and chairs, too small and not very comfortable considering that you spend $ 300 per person, anyway thanks to the food, we can accept a little bad back part of the body , . come bac
5
The price is quite high though worth it. The food is excellent, very innovative and the taste of each plate was well rounded up. The produce used are all very fresh and if seated at the bar you can watch how your plates are being prepared
5
Thanks to Ryan and his team at the Tippling club, Awesome!!! We had about 25 courses with matched beverages.
5
Best meal that I have had in Singapore , the tasting menu was just amazing .
Great that the chef comes out to the table all the time. Great location , fabulous food and really good service
I will be back
5
Pick the gourmand menu. The food prepared by Ryan clift's team was excecuted well. Probably one of the most exciting menus on the island. Everything was perfect and a great adventure for a night. Seats by the kitchen were probably the best in the house.
5
Came here recently for the set lunch menu. $42++ for 2 courses or $57++ for 3. Took the 3 course option which seemed to include a bonus additional 3 small starters. House wine at $12++ a glass. Great quality food, good service. Convenient location in Tanjong Pagar road. Will certainly pay another visit

Having heard about this restaurant through friends we decided to give it a go. Well we weren't disappointed, the food, the staff, the cocktails were amazing. We decided to go for the 10 course menu - and it was more like 20! Each course better than the last and a truly unique menu and so delicious. The cocktails were also wonderful, both in taste and presentation ! Would really recommend trying a couple of cocktails before eating.The staff were also fabulous, coming out every so often to make sure were were enjoying our meal and taking the time to chat with us about the food and their vision.One of our party was vegetarian and they made sure that their menu was no visually or in taste any different to the rest of the party ! We have since recommended the restaurant to many of our friends in Sing- all of which who have been have left feeling amazed and as if it was one of the best meals they have ever had. If you are fan of molecular fine dining in a cool trendy location then this is the place to go in Singapore 
4
We all know what molecular cuisine is, so it is understood that this place isn't for every one. For my part, I always been the curious type, love trying new things, being surprised or challenged, I like to make all my senses exercising, and I have to say, The Tippling Club is the perfect place for me.I really enjoyed our dinner, it was exactly what I was expecting, the whole experience was superb, congratulations to the chef and his team, on top of it, it is not excessively overpriced (like many other places I went). I will definitely advise anyone to give it a try at least once and I think Singapore needs a place like that
5
This is one of my favourite restaurants, not only for the amazing food you get to experience eating but the staff that serve you. Chef Ryan runs a great restaurant and his creativity and skill with food never ceases to amaze me. It is expensive but well worth it. Absolute winner and a must go to. We will continue to go back again and again
5
This is one of the best restaurant i have ever been to. The kitchen is open concept. It has the best food presentation. Every dish is like a piece of art. We ordered a 3 course set dinner, a glass of wine included. SGD 70++ per person. The chief will come to the table to give an introduction about the food for every dish served. The chiefs/ staffs can mingle well with the customers. Excellence food, ambient, service and offer the best dinning experience. Highly recommended!! value for money

The Tippling Club is not only an amazing bar it is also an amazing restaurant. I have lived in Japan, Australia, London and Singapore, as well as travel regularly for my work, and I have not come across an establishment quite like the Tippling Club. The food and the drinks are exquisite, and importantly, they are served in a fun way in a relaxed atmosphere by staff who love their work. If you haven't tried it I recommend you do so you can say you went there before it got its Michelin stars - because it will get them. My iPhone photos speak for themselves I think..To the reviewer tagged Great Taste L - it is difficult in Singapore to give the best of service given the manpower crunch. When a chef jumps behind a swamped bar to get you free drinks you should be grateful. I assume you were the same person that wrote "F#$k Off" on the bill and gave the obscene gesture. You upset many that night and despite being remorseful you have carried on like a child with your shameless review. I hope you are removed from Trip Advisor

I moved to Singapore 7 years and this is the worst bar I ever been to. I went with three friends of mine and we had to wait for 30 mins every time we order new drinks. They told us it's busy but there were only 20 ppl in the bar. when I complained to chef he came back with 'cheap' tequila bases cocktail and said sorry. I order a 'dried martini with gin Base' they didn't even ask what gin. Chef is snobbish and has no sense of service. Will I go back? Are you out of your mind
5
Pure seducement of taste, the new location is elegant and cozy, service is great, one of the best dining experiences in. Singapore
5
Amazing staff , groundbreaking dishes. If you want to be wowed , come here.
A must stop for serious food lovers , and lovers of one of a kind cocktails.
This place never disappoints.
4
Hard to find, but definitely worth the search.very friendly staff and very exciting food.
We had a lunch menu for a very acceptable price.
If you like modern cooking, this is the place to go.
Also for cocktails.
5
A business dinner proudly hosted by my Singaporean clients, and what a treat! An eight course matched degustation menu, preceded by a cocktail called ,the Old Man & The Sea' that had me wobbly before I started. To try and describe the individual courses would be a clumsy attempt at describing beauty or joy, so I concede. Just try it for yourself and report back to me....

Wanted to try this restaurant for dinner but was wary as lately there are many restaurants that focus on presentation and gimmicks more than providing pleasant dining experience,so opt to check out lunch instead. Decor is creative but tables are quite cramped and seats are not so comfortable. Opted for 3 course lunch $57++.Was served 3 amuse bouche . Curry foam in a pot- hey ! curry taste exactly like the curry u get anywhere in sin ! Nice but if I want curry I can get it anywhere., anytime, also foam are too slimy for the palette. Good try though! Charred pepper with miso - nice crispy charred pepper!!, dollop of miso is a tad too salty .Clear tomato broth served in test tube with basil oil...- ok..Appetizers- Watercress soup served with 60C egg.- simple , down to earth watercress soup with some interesting charred nuts , topped with sous vide egg .. Nice ! Err but pouring soup onto the plate is also a little boring now...Wagu carpaccio - interesting mix of horse radish , hazelnut, tomato.. Not bad! Main course - Ocean trout with buttered leek and lobster foam - mushy - can easily mashed it up by pressing with back fork , I made myself some salmon tartare in 1 minute - not quite pleasant... - bad Celeriac risotto- , good donesss of risotto , crspiy celaraic , not bad but nothing worth mentioning. Desserts are more interesting , with delicate plating and interesting assembly of creative items - v good ! Sad to see that they still think the expansion of compressed hand towel will thrill guest . clear tomato juice with tint of basil seemed too familiar .. must have been around for last ten years.. Well have to think twice about trying their degustation dinner as they are not excitingly innovative and most of all, the tables and chairs are not too pleasant for a long dinner...BTW, sparkling water are charged based on per pax, at $7 per head.
5
This restaurant is never disappointing. I love the new location, it has style and class that matches the service you get when you get to experience the most amazing taste sensations. Ryan and his team give you nothing but fantastic mouth watering dishes all incredibly creative. This restaurant is definitely way up there with the best in the world it deserves to do well

I didn't know much about this restaurant when we heard about a special opening event they were hosting. We signed up for a set dinner menu with cocktail pairings. The prices are high, but given what goes into creating and making the delicious dishes,, the unique cocktail design and the excellent service, we found it worth bunches of same-same meals at the ubiquitous hawker stalls.The space looked interesting, the open bar and kitchen gave it an energy that made me think more of NYC or San Francisco rather than Singapore, and the staff busying themselves with their respective tasks was interesting to watch and engage with. My husband and I wanted to eat at the long bar that cuts along the length of the restaurant. Fortunately, there was space. I can't remember what all we ate but I do remember that not only was the food delicious but the presentation was unique and made both of us ask for details about the ingredients and the designs. I think this was the first restaurant where I had a dish that was served in a miniature plant pot, something you would see in a Japanese restaurant, but not something I expected to see in a Singapore restaurant. If you go, you must try all the one-of-a-kind cocktails. The way they present them, in creative vessels with interesting concoctions of flavors and colors, makes them sublime and conversation pieces. After that first dinner, my husband and I went back several times, always for dinner. From the reviews, it sounds like they offer lunch as well. Having never tried their lunch, I can't comment. But if it is anything like their dinners, I would recommend it

Recommended by a local this was our favourite outing in Singapore. We took the whole family including one fussy eater..We went for the lunch menu (Saturdays) which was $55 each not including taxes. The food was the best I have tasted. I had eel for entree, wagyu beef for main and deconstructed pear tart for dessert. You are also given 3 little tasters to start. Drinks are expensive , $25 for a glass of wine. The service was excellent and all meals were explained to you. Even the fussy eater experienced all dishes because they looked so cool
3
We went to The Tippling Club with high expectations and left somewhat disappointed. We opted for the classic menu. Some of the food was very good (oxtail) and some really was odd and not very tasty (milk desert). The wine pairing gave very small servings compared to other tasting menus in Singapore. The cheese course was very over-priced and not what we expected (it was just two small pieces of goats cheese on two crustinis). I recommend not opting for that. The cocktails we had pre-dinner were good and quite different. The bill for 4 people came to over SGD 1600 and sadly it wasn't worth the money with so many other dining options in Singapore.
5
Tippling Club is the best that can happen to you when you are looking for a spectacular gastronomic experience while in Singapore. Ryan Clift is at the helm of this restaurant that will inspire your senses: be prepared for a discovery tour that can go over 20 courses.Each course is introduced by one of the kitchen team and optional (and you should definitely go for that option!) paired with their own cocktail creations. Stunning presentations, bursting flavors and the constant question that pops up in your mind: how did they do that?Tippling Club is innovative, unconventional, modern - a must stop-by for every foodie. They are my favorite restaurant in Singapore and every guest I brought here was over the top impressed when they left
5
AMAZING!All I will say it that you have to go.We had the most fanastic meal ever and we have eaten our way around the world.We went on a Saturday night, the place was only about 1/2 full, but it had a great atmosphere, the staff were fantastic and the hours flew by without us noticing. The food is utterly amazing.No, it's not cheap, but I would go again in a heart beat.Save up, make a booking, you won't be disappointed

This was a molecular gastro experience and while the technique and some of the dishes were fantastic I also felt that some of the dishes had to much emphasis on unique techniques and less on flavor. By far favorite dish was the flash frozen beer ice cream, melt in your mouth amazing. It was also very expensive and lacked atmosphere
4
Went to Tippling Club with some friends for the 5 course degustation meal. Was a little surprised when we were seated at the bar but it lent itself to a more relaxed atmosphere. Whilst one cannot say it is cheap, it was certainly an amazing taste sensation. We were served up about 5 amuse bouches...hard to say if my favorite was the tomato essence in a test tube with a suspended drop of basil or the truffle styrofoam! Truly amazing flavors and textures. The beetroot oxtail was simply divine...rich and tasty! We had to slow the service down as we felt as though we were being rushed. Probably my comment on taking this foodie feast to the next level was the main course....it was pigeon. I have had it before so am not averse to it but mine portion was stringy and tough....my friends portions were ok. If main course had been pork or duck or venison then it would have taken the meal to excellent!We didn't do the wine matching and instead chose a lovely Brunello which was reasonably priced!We went on a Saturday night and it wasn't overly busy but then it was a long weekend so people had probably escaped.I have to say the taste buds had a work out and if I go back I would try the 10 course menu! Also the chef is moving in December so it will be in a different location.Also had a cocktail prior to dinner and could not recommend it...it was called Gloria...too alcoholic and too much in your face to start a meal
2
The place looked really cool. The drinks and coctails are well planed and executed. But..the place was empty 22:00 on a monday. Looks like they preferd we wouldnt have come. The 5 course meal was over priced 160sgd per person and under chef meals standarts basically was horrible. Fills liked we were ripped of for 530sgd. In other overpriced restaurants in singapore u get allot more for your money..
5
I Thought I was over degustation meals, but tipping club has brought me back into the fold. It's at the back of the Dempsey hill complex, down an embankment and stairs. There's a small sign. We went for lunch, which is superb value - $55 for base 3 course (additional supplements optional). After freshening up (itself a un experience) We were surprised by 3 amuse bouches, which were clever, cute and delicately balanced. Our entrees and mains were faultless. Outstanding value on the food front. Drinks though are expensive, but you can of course work to budget. We emerged well fed and watered nearly four hours later, having enjoyed ourselves immensely. $320 per couple.

For pics and an in depth review, please visit my blog at: http://www.treatsandmeats.com/blog/2013/7/15/tippling-clubI'd heard incredible reviews about Tippling Club and Ryan Clift so was pretty bummed when my experience was less than memorable. My husband and I had gone solely for their drinks and bar snacks, so my review doesn't extend to their lauded tasting menu (though it did look rather appetising!).We started off with some drinks, which they seem to be famous for, but unfortunately didn't find them very palatable. I'd hoped to have a drink with champagne & gin but it wasn't on the menu and the waiter refused to customise one specially for me. Now I'm definitely not spoiled or princessy, but just thought it was a bit rigid for a high class establishment, doncha think?Their bar snacks were definitely the highlight of the night. We got some polenta fries, fried haloumi and bacon croquetas. The bacon croquetas were probably my favourite as the taste of smoky bacon permeated the little, crunchy potato balls and enveloped my mouth with every bite. The interior was also surprisingly dated and old! For a more in depth review, please read my blog above

Have never had a chance to dine at the tippling club, price wise for a restaurant that only serves set menus for a fussy eater like me I will probably give it a miss. Though for funky modern cocktails with a dash of theater this place is always near the top of my list on go to bars in Singapore.
5
Think Fat Duck in London or Eleven Maddison Park New York... These guys put amazing creativity into food with an Asian twist... We were blown away for our honeymoon and keep going back. Service impeccable, drinks made from a bar tender who has won accolades. Whiskey sour our favourite. Food to die for. Hats off
1
Went to an extremely overrated ( top 50 bars in the world ) tippling club 3 other guests only and still had a trainee attend to usHe didn't know the menu. Having a chef return with only olives for he veg guest from the entire menu ..... And they could not cook anything not in the menu ???? Hospitality ???The bartender did not have any tequila cocktail while they advertised at the entrance that tneir special for the day was a tequila cocktailPoor service till we called the chef who apologised for the staff being new and unaware but too late !!! It's not in the 50 best in the world for sure .... Would be surprised if it makes it to 50 best in Dempsey 
5
We ordered the 5 course tasting menu with drink pairings at the Tippling Club and wished we had gone for the 10-course by the end of the meal. Each course was outstanding, with the King Fish and Pigeon being notable standouts. Many molecular touches in the presentation but flavor is the focus.Quite an interesting interior design as well, with many jars of alchemical ingredients on display (like a old-fashioned chemistry lab). My only negative is that the cocktail pairings were far more interesting than the wines. Once you taste them, the wine pairings seem less interesting.Highly recommended if you like modern cuisine
5
Again we were not disappointed with this restaurant. It is worth every penny. If you enjoy food with imagination and flavour look no further a definite must and the staff are absolutely amazing.
5
We went to Tippling Club for lunch on a Saturday. We first heard of this place because of their cocktails, and didn't really know what to expect from the food. Strangely we were the only customers during lunch that Saturday, so we felt very well taken care of. We were seated at the bar, which was excellent. We appreciated the fairly unusual concept of combining the food with cocktails. Both food and cocktails were excellent! Some of the small dishes were nothing like anything we've ever had before - there seems to be an experimental vibe in the kitchen. All in all - a very good experience!
3
We went there with a friend and order a tasting menu. The food as some intersting flavor and was very nicely presented. But in my point of view when i go to a restaurant i like to know what i am actually eating.For each cours we add a cocktail to pair the dish but again i rather drinking wine with my meal. the service was on the other side good and efficient. Overall we will come back put only once a year as it not the cain of food that you want to have in a regular basic
5
My wife and I had lunch at the Tippling Club on Saturday. Absolutely amazing food and service I am struggling to pick a stand out dish as they were all amazing although if pushed the 48 hour cooked short rib was unbelievable. The Staff could not do enough for us making cocktails to match the dishes as well talking us through the meal and ingredients. Everyone was passionate about what they do and the whole experience was one of the best we have ever had. Special thanks to Paul the head chef and his team. We will definitely be going back. Head and shoulders above anything we have eaten in Singapore
5
This is one of the best if not the best restaurant in singapore just based on its variety, ingenuity, setting, ambiance, and quality and consistency of food. Watch the chef prepare drink's that came straight from heaven with sleeves covering both arms he leads through through an explosion of different tastes and never ceases to amaze!!

The title is a quote from the Australian TV show Kath and Kim. I think they would have enjoyed it, although Kim would definitely have asked for larger portions! I had thought that I might feel the same way, as the Tippling Club offers a tasting menu (2 different tasting menus, to be precise), with lots of small dishes, accompanied, if you wish, by paired drinks. We chose the smaller of the two menus and the paired drinks option. In fact, there was plenty to eat, as small course succeeded small course over the course of the evening. The meal started with a series of amuse- bouches and the cooking of the chef, Ryan Clift, certainly does amuse your bouche, as well as several other parts. He does not consider his cooking to be molecular gastronomy ( I know this because he came and chatted to us a couple of times over the course of the meal), but, having eaten at Heston Blumenthal's Fat Duck, I recognise several of the elements. Highlights for me were the carrot gnocchi, although I found the broth they were in just a little sweet, the chicken with mushrooms and truffle macaroni and the pre-desserts. The almond foam on "everything almonds" deserves a special mention among the pre-desserts. It smelt most wonderfully of almonds yet had the texture of nothing when you put it in your mouth - it literally disappeared on the tongue. The food gets a big tick, the drinks less so. The pairings were mainly cocktails, which, in my view, are less good with food than wine is. That said, we wanted to give the whole experience a try, as intended by the chef, so we went for it. One of the issues for me was that the amount in each glass was no more than a couple of slurps, and I'm a several slurps per glass girl! So, it's a thumbs up to the food, which is pricey but unlike anything else Singapore has to offer, a thumbs up to the ambiance, provided you sit at the bar and watch the kitchen action unfold in front of you and a ho hum to the drinks pairing. I said the food was pricey, but it represents much better value for money than the drinks, in my view. The food is a work of art, imagination and some strong technique. If you have a special occasion coming up, and like some theatre with your dinner, consider the Tippling Club

good service, good atmosphere. Too experimental and in the style of the worst of Michelin restaurants, they assume that having exotic ingredients will automatically create a great meal. The skin on the milk of Mongolian buffaloes sounds great but do something great with it and dont stick in a dish because it is the skin of the milk of nnnnnnxxx. Read AA Gill on Michelin and you will understand bette

Honestly going outdoors for a cocktail is not a great start to the evening. It's unkept and shabby more akin to a beer garden. The male door host couldn't give a toss about a warm greeting. So after you slip between the curtains and past the empty tables and relegated to the shabby outdoors and wiltered plants because you don't have a table reservation - you are thinking the cocktails had bloody better be good. The cocktails (we had 3 each) are fabulous. Thank god they didn't serve any in test tubes but the perfume bottle was cutting it fine - however the liquid pink was absolute sensual pleasure.Cocktails would score 8/10 if there was less ice (in those that had it) Wait staff were knowledgable - imagine in singapore too. Overall beer garden experience just didn't cut it. Oh and no interesting nuts to accompany our drinks just very ordinary menu items. Honestly for the price of the cocktails a few peanuts is not a big ask.

We decided to have the 10 course tasting menu with paired drinks. I was there with my adult daughter. We sat up at a horseshoe shaped bar to eat and spoke to the servers as they finished assembling each dish as they described the dish including ingredients's origins. We had 6 amuse bouches. This included tomato water (served in a test tube served in a test tube rack) with a clear straw containing a green plug (basil oil) through which you drank the tomato water. Theatre and fantastic flavor in one. Scallops, seaweed, beef, quail eggs... the list goes on - all beautifully presented and amazing mixtures of complementary flavours and colours. Each course was a surprise and delight, even the end was amazing - fresh salted soft caramel chocolates. I'm not a sweet fan but I loved these, so much so I asked to take some home.I wish I could have a copy of the menu but you don't get one! The only downside for me, as I can't remember it clearly towards the end - or was that the amazing cocktails, champagne and wine?All in all an amazing experience. If you like Aramburu in Bueons Aires you'll live this

I came here for a special occasion and to try out their tasting menu, which you have a choice of 5 or 10 courses, with drinks paired with each course.The whole experience was great, although the bill was hefty.The service from arrival was seamless, with friendly, attentive waiting staff that guided us through our meal without being pushy or overbearing.Our table was overlooking the kitchen / bar space, which was great as it meant we could oversee the many chefs preparing our food right in front of us.We started with some amuse bouche and then into the 5 course tasting menu.All dishes were beautiful presented and showed originality and variety.Not all courses were perfect/ to my taste (inevitable with experimental dining) but the vast majority.Highly recommended for a special occasion but get saving

We decided to go here during our second trip to Singapore after extensive research and weren't disappointed.The restaurant is in a great spot at the back of the Dempsey Road strip and wasn't too hard to find in the dark - even though our taxi driver didn't know where it was.We entered a very intimate scene - with only a handful of other diners and drinkers inside. The staff certainly outnumbered paying customers.There are only 2 menus to choose from - both degustations and both expensive. However when you see what goes into each dish, the products and machinery used and the staff numbers/training, the prices are justified.Each course was small but full of flavour and well explained by the chef who prepared it. It was nice to see the owner Ryan Clift working in the kitchen and leading his staff.We didn't get the matching wines/cocktails with our meal as we just couldn't justify the price (double the food only option) and bought a bottle of wine from the extensive wine list instead (still very pricey for what it was, but that's Singapore's taxes). We left after several hours happy and better for the experience.This is a special occasion restaurant - at nearly $600 Australian for two - you are paying for the memories as well as some amazing food
3
Tippling club is a fun place. They have some really incredible cocktails. But the food is not worth trying. Or maybe if you are australian and don't have any food culture you will like it. The whole menu doesn't make any sense. The chef doesnt really work on all those great products you can find in Singapore and this great and diverse food culture they have there. The cocktail pairing is working particularly well either.And its also ridiculously expensive.To sum up, go there to grab an inventive cocktail... But nothing els
5
Finally found the chance to try this place and happy I did. Arrived in the rain and there was some nice banter with the friendly maitre'd. The setting is quite unusual and daring, taking the open concept kitchen to another level. We sit around at the bar and you can see all of the kitchen and the plating is done inches from you. We opted for the lunch set, although the 2 dinner degustations are also available for lunch. Strange. The lunch set is a 3 course but before that, a parade of 3 amuse bouche arrived - a cold soup which you suck from a curved test tube and eating the cavier sitting on it at the same time (genius), an interpretation of Singapore curry, and some tempura fried long bean which you take with a tweezer. All good. My starter was a mushroom with macaroni which was good. My main of risotto with beet root and oxtail was a pink surprise which I also liked. My friend felt his duck confit a little small but I told him he was just being gluttony. My dessert was their interpretation of the surroundings, and they made a forest with chocolate, green tea shavings etc. which was pretty and delicious. My friend had the sheep cheese which I thought was why too pungent, way more than blue, and like smelly socks. Overall, I liked the food, and perhaps glad I made the right selections. Service was excellent throughout and friendly. Deserving of a place in miele's Asia top 20 restaurant

We dined here on NYE and had a great time. It was an unforgettable experience to sit around the kitchen and watch the chefs cook and serve you. The food was exquisite, the best we have ever had. We have been to quite a few big names in aus, nz and Singapore but chef Ryan's food is outstanding. Tippling club should be in the top 100

Overall a great experience. I prefer a bit more going on in the dining room, but the staff made up for it, just the right amount of interaction - High fives over the bar :)Not cheap, but we went the hack with the gourmand with wines.. which we loved!One thing that did catch us out was the procession of amuse before the menu started.. we thought the dinner proper had begun.. haha

A culinary delight with excellent service in a relaxed atmosphere. This is the second time I had the pleasure to taste the gourmand menu and I have been even more surprised by the food and the presentation the second time. The dishes were presented in a way to give you as little indication as possible about their taste, so we could taste each of them without a priori idea of what to expect. A superb experience

We found this restaurant online and had no expectations other than a quirky website and a fixed menu. What a find! Everyone is seated at a counter surrounding the kitchen so all the food preparation is done in front of you. The food is exquisite with unique parings and flavours, and presented in the most exotic dishes and utensils. There are only about 30 covers (more outside at lunch) and almost as many staff.It turn out the chef-patron Ryan Cliff had cooked for us before in Melbourne; another memorable meal. If you are a "foodie" this is a Must Visit restaurant. They will move closer to the city centre shortly but still with only 30 or so covers

We have been going to this restaurant since it opened. It is consistently good and every time I am amazed with what comes out. Always one of my favourites is the charred capsicum with wasabi dipping sauce, my taste buds totally stimulated every single time. The staff look after you incredibly well. Ryan is an amazing chef with a great team that work with him. We will continue to go to the Tippling Club for this amazing experience. Definitely one of the top restaurants in the world

We visit Tippling regularly and it's consistently ranked as the No. 1 restaurant in Singapore for us (followed by Jaan and Andre). It's always an exciting culinary adventure at Tippling and chef Ryan Cliff is wonderfully creative and talented. While many chefs now try to incorporate molecular gastronomy in their repatoire, we've found most can't execute it well or else it's usually a hit and miss. We feel none so far have been consistently good as Ryan, Good news too for vegetarians as we find he is just as adept with non-meat as with meat dishes - something very rarely found in even the best chefs around. The adventure doesn't come cheap, but at least you're guaranteed to get what you pay for. Tippling is by far Singapore's The Fat Duck or Alinea

The Tippling Club, like its understated entrance, is a bit of a well kept secret in Singapore! Diners have the pleasure of sitting around a U-shaped long bar, beyond which they can watch the army of chefs preparing (and often appearing to play with!) their food. Anticipation certainly buzzes in the air as you watch the chefs burning, chopping, layering and otherwise manipulating ingredients....leaving you wondering, what in heavens is that? The food is unlike anything I've tasted before and encapsulates the whimsy and joy of molecular gastronomy! We were thrilled that they could prepare a vegetarian menu for us with a day's notice, comprising of, amongst others, potato and leek soup served in a horizontal pipette, a brilliant dish of charred peppers and wasabi mousse (that looked deceptively like chocolate), faux gnocchi, and the highlight of everything for me, textured milk! The textured mllk was delightful, almost like a creamy honeycomb that melted on the tongue. It was served with a yoghurt ice-cream that was rich and tangy, providing a counterpoint to the crunchy sweet textured milk. The mocktails served were creative and fun, playing on the preferences that we expressed - I got a ginger soda concoction that was yummy, although it could've done with less ice!All in all, a fantastic dining experience and the perfect place to celebrate special occasions

Tippling Club has been the beacon for cutting edge food exploration in Singapore.
Chef Ryan pushes the boundaries as to where the culinary arts are headed.
If you really love food , wine , cocktails this is the place to visit in Singapore.

Love the refined design, intimate location...try the fake blonde cocktail

Went in for an afternoon cocktail. Rubbish Service. Informed that if the cocktail was not on the drinks menu, they wouldn't make it! The Tippling Club title suggests a full range of drinks but sadly that is not th case. So....we left!
3
Laboratory inspired cocktails and experimental gastronomy (mushroom dirt or meteorite on asphalt anyone??!!) Hester Blumenthal styled menus. Expensive but not necessarily fulfilling as a dining experience. More of a curiousity than a meal.

After a strangely long hiatus, we returned to Tippling Club only to ask ourselves what on earth took us so long to come back. The food, service, drinks, ingenuity of the dishes and concoctions of cocktails is truly mesmerising. Tippling Club is truly unique and it would be a crying shame if anything was to happen to this place. Absolutely first class in every regard. Sit at the counter, order the classic menu with drinks pairing and prepare to be impressed. Excellent

First off, The Tippling Club is unlike any restaurant you have been to. It is one man's vision, Chef Ryan Cliff, that makes this such a standout dining experience. I have been twice & both occasions were memorable. The cocktail list created by mixologist Matthew Bax is inventive, not to mention delicious & intoxicating. I had a mojito, the likes of which I have never encountered before. Dinner was a degustation menu & wine pairing both occasions, the second was when a visiting chef was cooking. Each dish was a revelation, a taste sensation with many layers & a surprise. This experience is expensive but it will be something you would return to for the uniqueness alone

We ate here for a birthday celebration having been keen to try the restaurant for some time. The food is based around a taste or a theme for each dish, which means every plate is a surprise when it arrives, there being no real description.Uniquely, most courses are paired with cocktails which compliment, or bring out the flavours of the dish.Having become used to lavish, and often over-rich, tasting menus in Singapore's fine dining establishments, we were thrilled to find the food light and refreshing - yet still indulgent!We had the 10 course gourmet menu which includes 4 petit fours and 2 pre desserts (making 16 courses in total)Diners sit in a U shape around the kitchen so you get a great view of your drinks and courses being put together, and how a kitchen works.The head chef has been creative in putting the menu together but not to the extent that any of it is unappetising, we enjoyed every course and loved a lot of them.I would highly recommend this restaurant experience. For the 10 course menu with paired cocktails, it came to $500 per person

Was sceptical of this place for some internal reason prior to going. Then even more so when I saw the matching drinks and elixers on the menu! Where is all the world glass wine me thinks to myself? Then before I know I have been assaulted by an array of amazing dishes with a few pretty solid wines! Casa Freschi was and always is a winner! Maybe attempt something different with one of the Gruner styles just to look as imaginative as everything else. But the accompanying mixed beverages that sneaked up and nailed me convincingly were superb, and matched the food very well! all the dishes were like something that has been thought right through with a deft touch. I have eaten in quite a few world renowned Degustation menu restaurants and found them all to be about 80%ers with dishes overall and a wee bit too poncy with the service. Tippling club on the other hand had direction with all the dishes. Ingredients were present to enhance, not just to extend the explanation of the menu. Staff were really relaxed and a bit of fun, and to discover the chap who was bringing out some the dishes and explaining them in great detail, turned out to be Head Chef of the operation! Genius! Only dilemma was at the end of the evening I had half a glass of red, a condensed milk can nearly full of a rum concoction (i think), a mini flask with something else a bit dangerous in it, so being the greedy pig that I am, consumed them all just to make the cab ride more hilarious.Not for those who prefer a home delivered bag from the McClown, but if you are at any level of the food exploration journey and you either have a rich friend or have saved a few pennies, then Check the Tippling Club out

First time visitors to Singapore from Australia; so I used the Australian Gourmet Traveller to get some ideas about fine dining in the city while we were there.The Tippling Club was highly recommended and I have to agree with the magazine; in fact I would give them even higher accolades than that.The only thing the place lacked (for us) is ambience, never the less the theatricality of the mixologists/waiters and the open kitchen and the interaction with the chefs more than makes up for that in my opinion.When we visited, the sous-chef, Paul Gajewski from Melbourne was in charge and we received copious explanations about our courses, backgrounds and preparation and even the sources of the food-items that seriously added an extra dimension to our enjoyment.We have chosen the tasting menu - mine 'regular', while my wife's was the vegetarian - without the pairing of the recommended drinks/cocktails and enjoyed just some glasses of wines from the well-thought out wine-list (an excellent chablis and a yummy pinot noir).It would take too long to write copious explanations of all the various item we had - suffice to say that we had 3 individual portions each of the amouse bouche - one with the finest Perigold truffles one can imagine -, a soup of which I licked the plate out; fish; gnocchi (made from carrots!), fantastic duck; also cheese + the desert to die for, which certainly was morish... Again, writing them like this just simply doesn't give justice to the care, thoughts and experience that goes into these dishes: as they say "do yourself a favour" and go there for an outstanding culinary experience.Finally, please know that you usually always get what you pay for - the work and the ingredients employed by The Tippling Club warrants its prices which we didn't find excessive at all.Hope to return one day

If your preferred meals come from McDonalds then it's unlikely that you will enjoy this restaurant. We've been in Singapore for almost two years and while we'd heard of this place we'd never been and we tend to stay away from Dempsey Hill. We often go to ODP in Tiong Bahru and it was a link from their website and a whim that lead us here for lunch today. We had the set lunch but have allready booked to head back for the degustation dinner for our anniversary. The three amuse bouche were a suprise, both in their presentation as well as their taste. The standout for me was the charred pepper with the soy and wasabi paste. The three courses were excellent and just the right size - not overwhelming. Their presentation was superb.Coffee was accompanied by three treats - the fizz bomb, the meteorite and a box of chocolates.The cocktails and wine list are fantastic.We couldn't afford to live there but we'll be back there for lunch again next Saturday

Fantastic is all I can say. I go to quite a few OTT, "are you good enough to eat here AND pay the bill places". In fact I have almost gone off a lot of super high end places as it seems you don't get much of a say when it come to degustation menus - i.e you dont even get to read what might be coming your way; the celebrity chef owner (if he is there) seems to think you will love what he dishes up! Well, I wandered out of one recently and almost threw up,the food was so rich it truly was sickening and it was then I vowed never to do another degustation menu again!Thank goodness for Tippling. My good friend Imax introduced me to it a few years back and I seem to go mostly for their great cocktails and maybe a light snack over a cigar outside onthe porch. Recently he convinced me to do their degustation plus matching drinks. Not cheap at about $300 a head but absolutely sensational with great service and commentary on food and wine without being to OTT about it and interfering with our night.I look forward to coming back Tippling alas, without the Imax, as he is leaving town - not in a pine box as most whoknow him would have suspected but due to a promotion

Went with 19 colleagues for dinner. The decor and ambience is nothing special.The food and drinks were overpriced to the point of inducing much mirth in our group. Our CEO was not as amused and would have cancelled if it had not been for the $145 per head cancellation fee. Does that tell you something about this place?The liitle food that we had was very nice, but so little it was as if we had dropped in and sampled a few delicious canapes at a cocktail party.If I had pased McDonalds on the way home I would have stopped for dinner, but hey! a full English breakfast was very welcome the following morning. This place is a giant con. Go soon because it won't be there for long

I think it would have been better if we had gone there for a meal but we went for drinks because of the name of the place and were disappointed! It was warm and stuffy. They didn't serve any chasers like orange juice or coke for bourbon..the plastic sheets that cover the walls were unclean and seats were uncomfortable. Drinks were not cheap either..all in all, would not visit again.

We were lucky enough to visit The Tippling Club twice during our stay in Singapore. The experience is sensory with the plating pleasing to the eye, the aromas the smell, the mix of flavours amazing the palate, the varying textures the feel and the sounds of the preparation directly in front of you the sound.The mix of matching wine or cocktail with each course adds a point of difference that in this case works extremely well with the pairings presented.Watching the chefs (in this case artists and extremely talented ones at that) prepare and plate the courses directly in front of you adds to the theatre of the night. Their obvious talent and love of the craft of food preparation can be seen and tasted in the end result.While you pay well for this experience, if you like food, it is rewarding at every level. For my wife and I and our mid twenties kids it was the highlight of our trip

I am not quite sure why it took me so long to finally decide to dine at Tippling Club. The experience was by far the best dining experience i have had in years! Together with my partner, we went for the 10 course dinner paired with drinks. Each served with their own unqiue cocktail/wine. For me to be able to discribe my entire dining experience would take me forever to complete this review. But if i had to try to sum it all up, here goes - Food prepared by Chef Ryan and his team was simple amazing. I am hardly a cocktail person. But every cocktail that came out together with the food had me wanting for more. This place does a very good job in balancing excellent food with excellent self created coctail. The whole dining experience was fun and every cent paid was worth it. Service was good too!Cheers to the entire team at Tiplling Club. We will be back for more

Was there for a function where the Masterchef Ryan Clift's created a special menu for the guests and did cooking demo as we feast into the sumptuous gastronomic 4 course meal. The Tippling Club has a posh yet relaxing atmosphere. Staff are all very efficient and service was great. All the dishes from appetizer to dessert were superb but what stood out was the Wagyu and how it's being cooked made the beef cheek literally melt in the mouth and bursting with all the flavours that totally divine. If you have a chance give Tippling Club a try, you won't be disappointed but be prepared to pay for the amazing masterchef prepared cuisine!Great way to impress someone special (guys FYI!) or for business luncheon/dinner

Recently dined here for dinner, a group of 4 of us. It is a one off experience for me. Very Heston Blumenthal styled food, but if I'm to give my own opinion, it just doesn't quite work here. I found many dishes components didn't really compliment in many of the dishes. The tiramisu was great though. Cool room and cool staff, good service

Tucked away at the back of Dempsey is an excellent find - definitely not cheap, but a fantastic experience in a relaxed atmosphere. Seated around the main food preparation area, we tried the Gourmand 10 course tasting menu with accompanying beverages, with 4 Amuse Bouche dishes whilst we savoured our starting cocktail.The easiest way to describe the food is that it is scientific: it is prepared perfectly and the flavours and aromas (of both the food and drinks) are at odds with their presentation, which gets the senses working overtime. This is served by the chefs themselves, who definitely enjoy their work and seem passionate about food. My favourites were the scampi noodles, pork belly served under a milk blanket, and the asteroid pre-desert (all pictured below).Luckily for us the menu changes every three months, so we will definitely be going back - well worth a visit

We had a tasting dinner with some friends, location is beautiful next to a green lush growth in the quiet part of dempsey. The food very very creative some truly interesting cooking techniques, we opted for the 5 course dinner but in the end received 8 courses. At first a bit odd regarding the seating they have a very large bar where a number of guests were having their dinner, there's a terrace but it was closed at that time however the longer you sit there the more likeable it becomes, Ryan is something else though some very interesting creations showed up at our table. one of those few rare talents that the worls needs more off!Would come back many times in the future for sure!

I like my food real, maybe that's the problem. It's definitely not cheap, worth trying if money is not a problem and you like experimental food.Drinks pairing is very creative, worth paying for if you are already going to dine there.Will I return? No. Will prefer to return to KGB in Paris
