So many bloggers have written about this place, its time to place the small stall in tripadvisor for visitors to check for themselves. Note that even Singapore's Prime Minister has queued 30 mins for their food. Plain Fried Bee Hoon at S$0.60 a plate, Fried Chicken Wings at S$1.20 a piece. Fish Cake at $0.50 a piece, Fried Luncheon Meat at $0.50 a slice. And the chilli sauce is free! Close on Monday, starts from 4pm onwards only
