Food were good. Dishes served fast. They cleared the dinner table so that we can have the cake-cutting and photo sessions. They provided the disposable paper plates and plastic spoons free of charge for the cake. Prices are reasonable too. Recommended.

Dish serving speed is amazingly slow.... Even at 8:20 pm. Until we pay the bill, still 1 dish not served. But still in the bill asked us to pay, have to argue and let them check all over again. Won't come again. 上菜速度不是一般的慢啊，即便是晚上八点多了，还是等很久都上不了菜。其他都空盘了没办法只好退掉没上的菜，结果买单的时候还出现在账单里，必须要让他们好好核对解释才避免多付钱，不会再来了…

I have been to this restaurant twice, and I will definitely be going back again.The recommended dishes are MUST TRY dishes of Yam's Kitchen. Although it is a restuarant, the pricing is definitely pocket friendly. Also, the staff was very friendly and patient while we were deciding what to order, despite us changing our orders a few time

Had a family dinner here with the family. Ordered the claypot fish which was done pretty well. Also ordered the fried chicken wings which my kid loved. The signature deep-fried pork belly turned out to be a slight disappointment as it did not turn out as I thought it would be. Would I come back here again? Given the limited number of Chinese offerings there, sure why not. At least food was not stale and the services provided were more than adequate.

Exquisite local Chinese dishes by award-winning chef.The curry fish head was flavourful and the roasted chicken is savoury and crispy. The seaweed egg soup is made with soybean milk as soup base, very special and tasty!A surprising discovery was their rojak. Beautifully presented on a cracker and the sauce is delicious.Another final surprise: Not only is there no 10% service charge, we got another 10% discount to the bill.Dinner for 6 persons totalled $150.We went a 2nd time at lunch, 4 pax about $80.Highly recommended

Modestly placed in a shopping mall, little did we know that Kalvin Yam and his crew is among the elite chefs in Singapore. Especially when it comes to fish tail recipes where they really excel and their technique is world class. Considering the experience, price is very fair. Go visit
