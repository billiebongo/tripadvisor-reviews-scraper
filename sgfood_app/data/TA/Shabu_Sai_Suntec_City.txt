Went on a friday evening.
Limited varieties and slow top up. Service was average. I guess it could be due to dinner crowd and limited manpower.
The table has limited space for plates and bowl, is not a very comfortable dining experience.

I have been there many times. The staff are very helpful. Wide range of food. Specially love the beef there. So fresh. My family enjoyed the food very much. But the place is not suitable for big groups. Not enough space. Will definitely go again.Yummy...

Level B1 of Suntec City, we found this gem of a lunchtime treat.Great dual hot-pot with chicken/beef selection. Abundance of fresh vegetables, great clearly labelled sauces which you can mix/match and we chose the 'beef' option. Beef very tender, next to no fat at all and only suggestion is that perhaps the beef was sliced a little too thickly for hot-pot.2 staff members (after all, how many do you need in a hot-pot environment) and they were speedy and attentive.Good, solid, value-for-money lunch in a pleasant, well lit (considering it is in the basement) environment - highly recommended

We had a family lunch at Shabu Sai at Suntec over last weekend. Itâ€™s has a wonderful buffet and we love the all you can eat for 19.90 ++ adults and 9.90++ for children. We love the soup base and fresh beef and chicken! Will definitely return for more

Located in the basement of Suntec City, this is a buffet style Shabu-Shabu restaurant. I was greeted and seated immediately upon entering the restaurant. The first decision you must make is to pick 2 types of broth from several options for your pot. Next you choose the type of meat you want and a beverage. After that, you are free to go to the buffet to choose whatever vegetables, noodles, etc. that you want to add to your hot pot. There are also a large number of options to create a dipping sauce to your liking. The meal is all you can eat and the meat just keeps coming until you are full. The ingredients were of high quality. I really liked the concept as you could customize your hot pot exactly to your liking without any waste. My only comment was I would liked another beer with dinner but there were no waitstaff available to order it. Great dinner

took us quite long repeatedly called the service staff till he finished with his mobile phone. Restaurant is open for business with lots of empty tables and yet the staff can tell us tables are booked yet no reservation tabs on the tables seen.The service level is so poor and the meats are still in total frozen state. I ask the staff for a smaller portion but he replied "just take the entire block la." and heard him grumbling something.Although the buffet is quite value for money, I would not return again. The machine run out of peach tea and lemon tea. I ask for peach tea, staff can tell me to drink what is available as he is not free to top up.The most ridiculous restaurant I have ever been to in Singapore

Visited off peak hours at 3pm and though there aren't many patrons, the wait to order and for food was too long for four hungry souls who had missed our lunch.Then again, the value sets are really of value. The Chicken Oyakoni is well cooked, the Salmon Teriyaki and Sukiyaki Soup are too sweet for us though

Went on a Thursday public holiday eve, which is considered weekend rate $24.99++, $1.99++ for free flow of drinks and ice cream. Practically no service, you need to grab the service staff for attention. The free flow of drink is peach tea, green tea, ice Lemon tea, coffee and tea. The drinks were really too sweet. Ice cream is only one type- the soft vanilla. Full of empty tables and yet they keep us waiting at the door. Think the staff could not cope. Top up was slow at the buffet counter. Told them there is no more chilli - went back twice and still no refill. There is unlimited meat. The pork and chicken were ok. There is too much fat on the beef. The broth is really good. There are 6 types (spicy, tonkotsu, shouyu, seaweed, yuzi collagen, tom yum miso)to choose from, both spicy and non spicy. They limit us to 90 mins for dinner. Overall decent, healthy food.

All the food were in small varieties but the quality was very good.Even the fish ball is very good.Service is nice, we didn't have any problem with staff.Few customer there but they always refill the buffet table.Too sweet beverage and too much tea

Full of empty tables yet we were kept waiting for long time and was told those tables are reserved. Only 1 person to service the ala carte section. There were 2 students drinking just 2 glasses of drinks and were being assigned a table for 6 pax ?!?

The broth is to die for. Put in the meats and let it simmer. Delicious. Add only $1.99 for free flow of drinks and ice cream. Yum 2 thumbs up

Enjoyed the sukiyaki, soba noodles with chicken and sushi lunch with macha tea. The food was very good and the view of the fountain with the dancing water was great

This restaurant, located in the Suntec Shopping Mall, was an unexpectedly good pick. The variety of vegetables, noodles, mushrooms, fish balls, etc. was a great selection and good quality. They also has a choice of 6 different soup bases!

When we have the craving for some good hot-pot, this place immediately came into our mind.
They served pretty good beef and there is a wide selection of broth. Love the yuzu, tonkatsu and sukiyaki.

Location is easy to find after come out from MRT station. Lunch promotion at only $14.99 ++per pax for unlimited meat supply. To add on $1.99 for free flow drinks and Ice cream. Definitely worth the price. Their new yuzu collagen and tom yum miso soup base were really good.

Visited this restaurant during lunch to celebrate wife's birthday. It was the 4th day of the cny, just after the long weekend holiday.A number of the usual condiments like peanut sauce and coriander leaves are not available. Some pieces of beef looked pale red. They ran out of pork too..

We were walking around suntec feeling hunger pangs & decided to try this shabu shabu place which we had seen but never tried.Environment is fairly relaxed and there was a few tables with kids.The meal was fairly satisfying.There was 5-6 choices for soup base and I like being able to have 2 choices. We had the seaweed and spicy base. The spicy was a bit salty but was nice for adding some flavour to the meat & vegetable. The seaweed was bland initially but become very flavourful at the end of the meal having absorbed it all.There was choice of meat of chicken, pork, and beef. There is a buffet table of assortment of vegetables, mushroom, egg, tofu etc. A fairly decent selection.Sauces are ponzu, peanut, sesame with chilli, garlic, peppers etc., There is also a free flow soft drinks and soft serve ice cream with additional top up. Overall food was decent and would be a good option for a healthy, heavy meal.

Visited Suntec for final dal shopping, saw Shabu sai with buffet promo, WE ordered slice beef with sukiyaki and Tonkotsu shouyu broth for the hotpot. Also had meat balls, fish ball, tofu, vegetable,rice noddle, soba and mushroom. The beef was so good, and the lunch was so worth it as price was cheap. Worth coming back to

We went here for lunch because we were craving for shabu shabu (Japanese hotpot). The buffet lunch set is very cheap (by Singapore standards), and we recommend going whole hog and getting the set with drinks and dessert. Fresh and delicious, we kept going back for more. Highly recommended for big groups dining on a budget

Shabu Sai has quite a variety of ingredients. My friends and I came for the meat. Their meat is thinly slice so that it would cook as soon as 5 seconds in the boiling hot flavored soup. Each pallet has 4 thin sliced of meat so you can actually order quite a number of pallets. There are different flavors of soup to choose from. And my favorite combination which I think is perfect I'd sukiyaki and sabu sabu. Sukiyaki is salty base and sabu sabu is light. So with every 3 scoop of sukiyaki, scoop 1 scoop of sabu sabu soup in your bowl. Like this it would balance out. Not too salty nor too blend. The meat are quite fresh at least for my friends and I. With the different variety we can have quite a balanced meal. For the amount that we eat, I think the price is reasonable.
