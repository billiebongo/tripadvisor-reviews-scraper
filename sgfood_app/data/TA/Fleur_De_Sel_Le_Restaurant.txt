Great place for a business dinner. Had the sweetbreads to start which were excellent. All four of us shared the steak for main which was amazing. A magnum of burgundy and diverse chessboard....it was a great meal!
5
We had the foie gras, beef and chocolate desert: it was fantastic! we also liked to atmosphere a lot. Just the wines were relatively expensive and not 100% my taste.
5
The most delicious meal I have had in singapore - had the set lunch which was amazing value with lovely extras of amuse Bouche and bread. Service was outstanding.
3
The good was excellent, the service was very good although a little bit too fast. The only downside was the noise . We could hardly talk to each other.
5
We had a lovely set lunch, it was good value and the food was of a high standard, the service was also good.
4
We have visited Fleur De Sel Le on a few occasions and the food has always been consistently good. The lobster bisque is excellent and beef is always grilled to my preferred doneness. We will definitely come back.
5
Everything made our dinner a great experience in this open kitchen restaurant. Food and service were perfect. And atmosphere was very comfortable and not too uptight.
5
Sensational food, we had the works: entree, main, dessert, coffee, complimentary bread and petit four, nothing disappointed. I had the lobster and my husband the pidgeon for main, both beautifully cooked and presented. Great wine and dessert wine at fair price for quality provided. Very attentive service although it was a quiet night with only three tables occupied. Lovely way to end our Singapore holiday. Cost $480 for two, money well spent
5
I found this restaurant on-line before travelling, and as it was just down the road from my hotel - and I was travelling alone - I thought this would be the perfect place to eat on my first night in Singapore. Why french food when you are in Singapore? Mainly because I love french food (done well) and knew that this place would deliver. I was not disappointed. From the moment I walked in I was made to feel welcomed and special. I was seated at a table right near the open kitchen, perfect to watch Chef go about preparing the most delicious looking food. While waiting for my order the waiter brought me a petite boulangerie accompanied by a delicious sauce. My entree was mouth watering Les Saint-Jacques - Pan seared Scallops, mushrooms, Arugula, Parma ham and chicken jus. I was tempted by the Lobster Bisque but as I was having lobster for mains I chose the scallops and was not disappointed. For mains, Le Homard - Poached Maine Lobster, fork mashed ratte potatoes, chives, bisque jus and Basil oil. It was sensational. Chef Alexandre Lozachmeur came to my table at the end of my meal to ensure all was satisfactory, and I discovered a little about him and why he is a Chef in Singapore, rather than France. He has lived in Singapore for years and is happy with his life and restaurant here in Singapore. So he should be. His dishes are inventive, delicious and beautifully presented. I will definitely go back next time I am in Singapore
4
This restaurant had great reviews so I was excited to try it. My starter the onion soup was good, the main duck confit gnocchi was average (the pasta was a tad too stiff and the passionfruit dessert was excellent. The service was average also - we had a very nice waiter plus another one that was a little nonchalant/rude
3
Nice cosy place with very friendly service staff! Dishes are average, it’s a small restaurant so reservations are recommended
4
An enjoyable evening out. The food was generally well executed and there was a decent wine list. The complimentary bread basket was lovely. Will return!
4
Totally enjoyed the food, place and service. Definitely worth paying a visit and repeated visits. The scallop, lobster bisque and cod fish are amazingly good.
4
The executive lunch and Fleur de sel lunch sets were great and affordable. The lobster bisque really good and the Lamb was done really well. Enjoyed it very much!
1
I've been to several upmarket restaurants in Singapore and was looking forward to try Fleur De Sel upon reading all the positive reviews and at the same time celebrate my birthday. We had the raved about lobster bisque and cod fish which are two of my favourite food. They turned out to be one of the worst I've ever had. The lobster bisque was diluted and flavour was weak. The cod fish was hard being overcooked and stale, devoid of the natural sweetness of the fish. We left before dessert to another place to avoid further disappointment. No staff in the restaurant even bothered to ask about our meal or experience. For the money spent here, you could get more satisfying and higher quality food accompanied by better service easily elsewhere. This place is not worth your money, time and palate
5
I went twice to Fleur de Sel in two weeks for very different dinners. The fist visit was a work dinner in the private room for 9 people. The second time was with friends. Both times the food was fantastic. Tried both the five and eight course set dinners. Highlights were beef tartare, pea soup, scallop and crab. Decent wine too although that's pretty expensive
4
Had came here twice for the set lunch and found it to be good value for the quality of food. I had enjoyed the lamb with ratatouille. Service in the restaurant is good and attentive. Had enjoyed the cheese platter too. A nice and quiet place to have a good lunch amidst the bustling of the area
4
the two of us took a la carte and the full degustation menu. Definitively a few good things and at the very least all the techniques are perfectly managed with good ingredients. yet, at the end of a 170++$ menu i was somehow missing a bit short changed on the excitement for new flavors or combination.top ranking is the cheese board (don't laugh, it is difficult enough). their bread in the Singapore scale is also top notch. no dish was not satisfying but the pigeon sous vide left me cold.very attentive and professional service. wine list pretty interesting without going into stratospheric prices. would return for a la carte only
3
This is a nice place for business lunches as offers pretty good value. Their set lunch offers a few choices of main courses including fish and beef and my favourite is their lobster bisque!!! Its a Must-Order and it never fails to impress during all my visits. Will definitely be back
3
The slow cooked lamb was way too soft and quite tasteless. This was communicated to the waiter and manager but nothing was done. They should have taken it off the bill or given a dessert. Even the coffee was charged. Scallops well cooked but no taste. Steak tartare was good
4
Very nice ice food and excellent choice of wines. but atmosphere is too austere. Anyway we spent a very nice dinner.
5
If you are in Singapore, this is the place for an amazing dinner.
Chef Alexandre and his team will bring you to a fantastic dining experience.
Large selection of wine, at a very reasonable price for Singapore.
And the food is superbe, authentic and delicious.
5
My family and I have been dining at Fleur de Sel since it opened few years ago. Quality of food is still very good. Love the bread, starter, mains and desserts. Would continue to revisit.
4
For good food and a warm welcome one can visit Fleur de Sel with closed eyes. Aside from an open kitchen and a friendly chef, the decor was forgivable if not a tad cold. It will not prevent from returning.
4
food was excellent as always and chef was patient as we were very slow getting to mains
Lamb was superbly cooked and greatflavours
Wine service was slow but otherwise attentive
5
Always had a great time in this French restaurant. The service is exceptionnal. If you are two, I would recommend to seat at the kitchen bar where you can watch the team prepare every meal, it's like a real show.Special highlights for the crab as starter and the duck as main course, and of course the cheese platter... Book your table in advance
4
Excellent service and ambiance. The decor was immaculate and service was attentive, taking time to explain each dish presented.The food was very good, scoring excellent on the lobster bisque, seafood entrees and desserts. Pidgeon and tenderloin was not so impressive.A tad pricey for lunch and portions provided. Approx $80/pax scoring an average rating considering the food, service and ambiance. Constant flow of top-notch fresh bread and butter (forgot to check if chargeable) helped keep me topped up
5
I'm french and the quality of the food there is really great. My duck magret was excellent and my wife took the homard which was also very tasty. We en up with some very good cheese and a nice desert.Service was very very well, attentive to details and very kind.The only thing that could be improve is maybe the room: we would love to have a more "cosy" one. :-)
4
We had a nice dinner at Fleur de Sel. The atmosphere is casual but the service very professional. The dinner menu was variated, tasty and quantity well spread across the dishes. An effort is made on the presentation which supports the experience.Only shortcoming: they could make an effort on the wine list which is rather costly, offering only an average value for money.
4
Had a birthday celebration here. Bread was excellent with the fleur de sel salt. Had pigeog done three ways which was also another star dish. The scallops and crab tartare dishes for appetizers are recommended. Other mains that deserve recognition are the lamb and duck. Cod fish was a little heavy
3
Food was alright, sauces were a bit strong for my liking. Ambience was lovely and staff were attentive to our needs.
5
incredible set lunch at a very decent price + great burgundy by the glass
we ll be back - the service was excellent !
4
food is fantastic. the service is also decent. chef is nice and comes around to clients.
the only thing i would suggest is to make the atmosphere quieter.
2
Layout and service are not so elegant. They ignored me when I walked in alone without my dinner partner. The waiter's hands was in contact with the amuse-bouche when serving. They were also not flexible with the changing of items within the set menu.
5
when the French says it's the best Baba Au Rhum in SG, then it is. The steak is as wonderful. good price for the quality!
5
The lobster bisque is one of the best in the city. The rest of the food is phenomenal. I absolutely love the place. Service is very prompt. The best thing about the restaurant is the cheese trolley!
5
Open Kitchen concept with surprising delicious "Michelin" standard cuisine. The restaurant is copy yet tastefully decorated creating romantic ambiance. Cosy furniture. Good for couples/friends for leisurely conversations
4
Very Nice and friendly service - CongratulationsAll dishes we ordered very tastyThe red wine (Saint Joseph 2014 - Les Pierres Seches) very nice as well Finished by a good variety of cheese Con: The A/C could be adjusted a little better - restaurant area was quite hot.Prices on the higher side, but still acceptable for a french restaurantThis is a recommendable restaurant
3
amuse bouche pumpkin mousse was tasty, dark bread fresh and crusty, beef for main course not exactly super tender, cod fish had a very strange texture (maybe frozen fish?), cheese selection for desert (SGD 7 extra for the lunch set) is good, but they keep the cheese in the open and the aircon dries the soft cheese out.would I come again: no, too much other choice in the neighborhood
4
Nice ambiance and very good service in this place and the meal started well with a very good set of entrees. Unfortunately the quality of the duck was below standard so while it was well prepared and presented it was pretty tasteless. Same for the deserts the Baba was tasteless. Cheese board looked good but the taste again was disappointing. Gave it 4 stars as we had a really nice evening but need to lower our expectations for our next visit. With a better sourcing of some basic raw materials this place could be very good
4
The restaurant setting is cosy with caring service staff. We ordered the set menu and the food is good at reasonable price. Worth another visit.
5
Great food, service and atmosphere. Will recommend to my friends, and definitely will come back again
5
The set meal is full of surprise. The portion is small but is the right amount to fill you up. Food is good and service is superb!
4
Very nice lunch experience with a super final with their chocolate dessert. Don't miss this nice little star with good service and atmosphere.
3
Was expecting a little better food for a michelin recommended restaurant. Generally quite average and nothing too special.
5
+ great and fresh food
+ delicious wines
+ nice small French restaurant
+ great chef
+ nice and friendly service
+ nice Christmas dinner menu
+ good location, easy to find
- quite expensive
4
The people are friendly; the food was awesome.
Just that from the main course to dessert, we waited for 30 minutes, so that was a rather long wait.
Other than that, everything was perfect!
5
The dining experience is 1st class, permeated by the chefs obvious pursuit of perfection. Every dish is covered with a will to please and definitely meets it's goal.
Can't wait to be back in town to sample this French food renaissance.
5
Wonderful and authentic French cuisine, excellent service with attention to every detail. The cheese cart is an absolute must along with a extensive wine list. A surprising find among the traditional shophouses and their attendant local businesses. Highly recommend.
5
We chose the degustation and set dinner. It was exquisite. Staff is very professional and the chef is keen to explain how he prepares your dish. You can ask to sit at the counter : you can observe the chef and his team preparing dinner. Wine was excellent and fairly priced. Would definitely return 
5
Great food, great ambience and great service. I go often and each time the food is excellent.
I would not call it a cheap place to eat but it is not terribly expensive.
5
We were there to celebrate my brother's birthday and we had the lunch sets. It was not as crowded as we had expected. The food were amazing tasty with great presentation. The service was good as well. Will definitely be back!
5
Brought my family there for a birthday celebration. Service and food was excellent! Must try their cheese selection, they have a good selection! Will definitely be back!
5
Thoroughly enjoyed the set lunches. Value for money and the wines are very reasonable compared to others we have dined.
5
The quality of every dish was good, and the set lunch ($48++) was great value. I will definitely go back again.
4
Had a wonderful lunch here . This is my fourth visit as usual the food was great. Had to rush off to another meeting, had no time to try the cheese platter. They got a good cheese selection.
5
Excellent food, great wines, good service, Fleur de Sel is one of our favourite restaurants in Singapore. I definitely recommend it for French food lovers!
5
This restaurant opened a while ago, but this was my first try yesterday.The ambiance is cosy, only a few tables and a few seats on the counter overlooking the open kitchen.The service is professional and friendly. Every time the waiter presented a dish, he explained the ingredients and how it has been cooked.Talking about the food, you can choose between 2 different dinner sets or a la carte. We chose a la carte, and it was really difficult to make a choice as every dish was so temptatious.To start, we have been offered a brocolis cream, served hot. So good and round in the mouth.For appetizer, we had the scallops with mushroom veloute and chicken jus. Then the calamaris in tomato sauce garnished with ratatouille (special dish from south of France), the lamb chops with vegetable tian (kind of moussaka), plus some roasted potatoes shaped like French fries.And for dessert, the passion fruit bavarois with pineapple fruit salad end coconut icecream.All dishes are make with fresh ingredients and perfectly cooked by the Chef. You can see him and his team working on the spot. The flavors are well balanced, not oily and not too salty. A real French cuisine, delicate and authentic.The cherry on the cake for me is the bread (I am a bread lover), delicious big slices of pain de champagne, soft inside and crunchy outside, served with nice butter and flavored salt.The menu has a wide choice of wine, even by glass. We tried white and red wine, both very good.I can’t say no more than we had a very nice dinner in Fleur de Sel and we’ll come back soon to try the other dishes
4
Went here alone and was a bit fooled by the area (not that nice). But the restaurant is lovely, waiters ftiendly, chef great! Portions just perfect and tastes were exciting (e.g. Homemade paste with rabbit and blue cheese/parmesan. So simple and so brilliant! Trout looked like a little painting with three types caaliflower. And the cheesewagon was to die for! Definately not my last time here
4
French-speaking men in this converted shophouse introduce the produce of the open kitchen, and efficiently whisk away your plates and top up your glasses. The set-lunch bisque, cod and chocolat desert was nice but not exceptional, the wine good. Perfect place to catch up with old friends
3
Good service. Good plating. But I would not call it "delicious". Maybe it's just not my cup of tea. The layers of flavor are not enough, or unbalanced. Too much cream and butter, making it quite boring. The seafood is frozen, lacking freshness...
5
Good place but the surrounding can be pretty stuffy during lunch. Thoughtful manager with complimentary soups throw in for birthday celebration.
5
Very tasty business lunch, reasonable price as it is out of the CBD and attentive service.
Just a nice place. We will come back to try the dinner at the counter!
3
They were slightly short of hands during lunch hour. Food was nice but service could be better to justify the price. Prob will return.
5
I made a lunch reservation here for 2 after having made a visit half a year ago. Staff were extremely polite and engaging, making appropriate recommendations; taking allergies and preferences into consideration. The Fleur De Sal Lunch here is value for money. We had the Homard and Foie Gras as appetizers, mains was Le Boeuf, and Le Baba for desert. The lobster bisque was delightful and was enjoyed the girlfriend. The beef tenderloin was seared perfectly, medium, and desert, Le Baba was amazing. Overall a memorable visit and would definitely come here again
5
I reserved a table for 12 for my wife's birthday. We were given the private room which was lovely. The staff were incredibly attentive. The food was nothing short of spectacular. I shared the beef with my wife and it's in my top 1-2 steaks I've had in Singapore. All the extras like the gazpacho starter and unlimited bread for free made the evening a huge success. The bottled water was charged for of course but we were ok to pay after all the freebies. Their wine recommendation was perfect. If I could deduct 1% it would be for the fact there is no music in the private room but we were loud enough for long enough for this not to be a problem. We were there until after 12 am with no pressure to leave.Well done to the Fleur de Sel team for serving up one of the best nights I've had in Sg for a long time
5
It was our first visit at the restaurant for a celebration of my fiancé’s birthday. We were warmly welcomed by the manager and decided to dine at counter seats where we could view the preparation of dishes - a new experience and an interesting concept to us. We each ordered the Fleur de Sel’s executive dinner set, with him going for the seafood combination (Le Homard and La Truite) while I chose the canard dishes (Le Foie Gras de Canard and Le Canard). We witnessed as how every single dish was carefully prepared, and when each course was served, Chef Alex and his team were very thoughtful: they detailed and explained to us the individual components within the dish, as well as how each ingredient was uniquely chosen to complement one another in terms of taste, texture (and definitely presentation). All the dishes were exceptionally flavorful and balanced, and we were truly delighted to discover how certain ingredients could actually go so beautifully well together. My fiancé was particularly impressed by his main dish La Truite, where the trout was cooked under low heat, and turned out really moist and delicious. The selection of cheese was extensive as well.Every subtle detail was well taken care of; the preparation was carefully timed so that both of our dishes were served at the ambient temperature and at the same time. The food portion was just right. As it was my fiancé’s birthday, Chef Alex and his team even surprised us with a complimentary cake ☺ Overall, the restaurant was perfect - we were very impressed by a menu of thoughtfully crafted dishes by a highly skilled chef and his team, and enjoyed a professional dining experience that came with a touch of closeness. This has by far been the best French restaurant we have visited in Singapore, we were really glad that we came here and would highly recommend this place
3
My husband and I went here for dinner after having read all the excellent reviews. Maybe we've made the wrong food choice but the impression left is it's a very ordinary french restaurant and we've been to much better ones. The interior feels 'naked', without character, no ambience, open-kitchen is not impressive honestly. The air-co is not strong enough, though I don't like it cold but this time I was literally sweating. The waiter who served us had an unbearable garlic breath.We had scallops, foie gras and monkfish, the sauce of the latter was overly salty, we did finish it though but we don't talk here about enjoying restaurant food. And when that same waiter presented the monkfish tapping with his palm against the board of my husband's plate, our eyes widened with mmmm...surprise I guess! It's supposed to be upscale restaurant but such personnel really seriously downgrades it. Desert (chocolate) was very good.We were underwhelmed by the' Wine by the glass' menu which was frankly very limited and could do better with some higher quality wines.The bill for 2 starters, 2 mains, 1 cheese plate, 1 desert, a bottle of water and 3 glasses of wine was 270$. So net net, it could have been a better experience with a bit different service, cozier interior, add some specials to the menu.
5
I was thinking of another French on Tras Street but booked this by mistake.It was a happy mistake as service was good and most importantly the food was nicely presented, delicious and of the right portions.$140 per head including dessert and wine. We had scallops, crab, asparagus, lobster bisque and Atlantic cod, all excellent. Le chocolat was fantastic, as was the cheese platter
5
Unpretentious, flavourful set lunch. the main (tongue) did indeed come across as rustic (the chef's grandma's recipe) , i wiped the dish clean. the desert with the pineapple bits was excellent - the mark of a truly great dish is how the flavours are so well put together , that each segment of the dish is great both on its own AND together - i wished they sold them as take aways. the service was warm and staff made the effort in genuine interested conversation rather than going through scripts. very enjoyable
4
Went here a couple of weeks ago
Great food, great service, all done with the feeling of being in France.
Highly recommended
5
The maitre de here is in a first class league. Very helpful guy. Food is good too. The setting is well done and pleasant. Only draw back is in parts the restaurant is too hot. Will be back.
4
We enjoyed a delicious business set lunch here, the steak tartare was tasty and the cheese selection outstanding! They have a good wine selection.
5
My wife and I went there again after having been there quite some time ago and it was even better than the first time. From the amuse bouche to the starters, the main course and the best of all, the incredible dessert, this is an absolute must-try in Singapore. The place is not very big and they work in two shifts for dinner: 6,30 and 8,30. We were on the first shift which is the quitest. The amuse bouche was a toast with some herbs and cheese and cold but very tasteful soup. Then followed the scallops (absolutely divine), rabbit pasta (superb), my wife had one of the set menus and so had a bit more to eat and finally a passion fruit dessert with cocos flavour and fresh pineapple. Also the staff is very friendly and helpful, as is the chef. We will go back here many times in the future, no doubt
4
It was a friendly business dinner and we had 7 courses. From all 7 we can tell that Chef used high quality ingredients, which make people who eat out very often like us happy: there's no funny business / mediocre or subpar item masked behind fancy name or presentation going on, we are happy to pay for quality. Good product, good Chef, efficient service. My favorite was duck and foie gras, Irish grass fed striploin with duck fat and ratte potatoes (I have huge respect for Chef that uses grass fed instead of grain-fed and/or wagyu) and oyster with cucumber jelly
4
A small french restaurant located along a row of shophouses along Tras Street. And oh, what a street! There are competing restaurants, and so many of them - ranging from Japanese, Mediterranean and even Korean but alas so little time. There are 2 french restaurants on this street. One is called Gavroche (which has a bar/bistro and a proper restaurant) and then this Fleur de Sel. I will do a review on Gavroche later and so look out for that. I arranged for a birthday to be celebrated among ex-colleagues and there were 8 of us. My secretary arranged and got us a private dining room. The one and only. And it comfortably seats 8. Right from the start, we had a lovely reception and was greeted warmly by the head waiter I think his name is Francois. We ordered our wine (lovely selection of white and reds) and was subsequently served with starters. The service was so subtle, we hardly noticed them and I have to emphasized this because we were in a closed door private dining room and for the staffers to do that - that's skill in subtlety. So you readers who want truly private dining - think about this. We booked for 8 but regretfully 2 could not make it - so we had 6. Yet the chefs (yes 2 chefs) came into the room and suggested that we leave our dishes with them. And so we did, and the food they prepared for us were lovely, exquisite and just the right portions. Nothing was wasted - we had complimentary dessert (nice touch Fluer De Sel !!!) and of course the ever smiling Francois who with his other staffers will come in every so often to replace wine glasses, dishes etc... and all done subtly. Well done - worth the visit - worth the dollar. !!!
5
Had the great pleasure to dine in this great restaurant. Chef Patron Alex is a genius as not only is his food exceptional, he has a wonderful personality and ability to engage with diners. Service excellent, wine list great value for money and will be back when next in town
5
Great restaurant with excellent atmosphere, and extremly professional services. It is located on a street full of upscale restaurant in Singapore, and you should not be disappointed if you chose to go here. Great food is almost a guarrentee and good wine list as well. We sat at the counter by choice, and watched the chef and his team at work all night, and talked to him throught out our meal. That in itself was an excellent experience. Must try while in Singapore
5
Its a small French restaurant at Tanjong Pagar area, airy and bright, good service, and open kitchen concept. We decided not to take the set menu, and opted for Alacarte and its proven to be the best decision. We start with salad and Lobster Bisque, which is soooo tasty, with crunchy crouton. The Lobster maincourse is PERFECT... with lobster bisque as sauce, the meat is so tender and juicy. We close it with chocolate praline cake with ice cream which is another winner, as the cake has crunchy biscuit on the bottom, so we can find different texture in every scoop.
5
Always now my first call when we have newcomers in Singapore , because we can always trust the service and the quality of the food served here. We always feel welcome, and the food is perfect . We had snails, lobster bisque, crab salad , cod and an amazing rabbit dish ( with pasta). My favorite French restaurant in Singapore by far. Extensive wine list as well, including some moderate prices as well which I always appreciate. Sommelier suggested a perfect Gevrey for what we had
3
Restaurant said they were full but when there, several empty tables. Average French set lunch. Liked the Atlantic cod and loved the sorbet desert. Service not on par with expectations.
5
Excellent dinner and service. Very high quality food and good explanation on each dishes. The sad thing is they didn't have oysters ! But overall I love this place. Good job.
5
Semi-business lunch. We opted for the set lunch menu. The food was beautiful, each dish wonderfully put together and presented with great attention to detail. The chef did a fantastic job of working with the ingredients and enhancing flavours and textures with smart contrasts and yet great balance. From the entrees, mains to the dessert all were divine. We even opted for a nice glass of wine on their recommendation and were not disappointed. Lovely way to spend a quality afternoon on a busy work day. Only feedback to restaurant would be to perhaps keep food menus on their website updated, as the set meal options were different than the ones we had viewed online and wanting to try on the visit. Nevertheless, the food was lovely!
5
Organizing a dinner for 25 persons (incl. Asians, Caucasians, adults and children) can be challenging, and more so if you are doing it from 12000 km away. However, after the first phone call with Chef Alex, we decided that's where we want to hold the event. The entire planning was done via emails and phone calls, but what we most appreciated was the friendly support and tips from the Chef himself, especially in the menu selection. Our arrival (30 mins. before the guests arrived) was the first time we set foot in Le Restaurant. Et voilà!We were overwhelmed. Everything was set up as agreed. Francois and his team provided outstanding service throughout the evening, which we thought was as good if not better than similar boutique restaurants in Europe.Needless to say, the dinner was sensational and delightfully French. Everyone was happy with the menu options, and the very good wines, of course!We love the open kitchen concept which allows for interaction between the guests and the Chef, in a family-like atmosphere. It was amazing how efficiently Chef Alex and his assistant prepared the different dishes so that all 25 persons were served almost simultaneously. Our favorites are the seared Foie Gras de Canard, les Saint-Jacques Pan-fried Scallops, the Brittany Dover Sole, and the Sautéed Maine Lobster.A truly wonderful and unforgettable experience. We will definitely return on our next Singapore visit and continue to recommend
5
I love this restaurant! We have returned many times for dinner and without doubt Fleur de Sel is our favourite French restaurant in Singapore. There food is exquisite and beautifully presented, the service is tops. The decor of the restaurant is warm, simple and elegant. Do not miss the cheese trolley...it is one of the highlight for us after the main course. In fact as I am writing this review, I had just made a dinner reservation for this weekend. If you have not been here, what are you waiting for
5
My second visit, and the 3 of us were amazed by quality of the food, the magic combination of unusual mix, a nice collection of wine, a fantastic cheese platter and fantastic desserts.My wife who is vegetarian and sceptical when menus have limited choices was pleasantly surprised with the chef ability to create off the menu options. We sat at the bar overlooking the kitchen, creating a different atmosphere while we could have opted for a more traditional a cozy table setup. The chef gave us some very good advise on wine while we started with a glass of champagne. The starters were amongst my favourites with the Crab in particular. The fish, sea trouts or Dover soles were good portions and while creative, retains some of the traditions of white butter sauce and excellent products.All decently price for a very high level French restaurant. 3 glasses of champagne, 1 bottle of pully fussé, 3 starters, 3 mains, 2 cheese platters and one dessert, coffee... For a 450S$ total bill. Should definitely return
5
I would simply say: sit down and enjoy. Food was delicious, I would highly recommend the pigeon and the service was attentive and not intrusive. The open kitchen concept is great; it sort of makes the atmosphere more inviting especially if, like us, one is sitting at the counter watching Chef Alexander in action! The whole evening the feeling was very relaxed, one could just stay on and on, sipping on great wines and nibbling on some of the special cheeses of the cheese selection. We will be back and recommend for sure
5
Real treasure of a French restaurant tucked away on the Tras Street which is gaining a name for itself for some truly fantastic dining venues. I have been here a couple of times before and took my wife for a Christmas treat and was very impressed by the food and service. The restaurant was teaming with great atmosphere, with Chef Alex and his assistance helming the open kitchen.I choose the 6 course Christmas menu while my wife took the Fleur de Sel degustation menu. Each plate was a beauty and my wife who is a avid blogger could not stop clicking away. I was particularly impressed by the foie gras terrine, tartare, scallops and the trout. Food was delicious, service was friendly, attentive and discreet. Will definitely be back
4
There are other places in Singapore with much more imaginative food, but this place has good solid French upscale bistro cuisine. We had the set menu, and were very pleased with the selections. Can't recommend anything specifically as it changes daily. Good wine list, pleasant unintrusive "service a la française" Wildly expensive, but this is Singapore
5
Fleur De Sel is a great French restaurant, a must try for those who love traditional French cuisine. Service is top, wine menu is great and cheese trolley is one of the best (maybe the best) in Singapore. Keep it up! Looking forward to go back.
5
I like the place. We had the set menu for $270 for 2 pax. Service was good, not amazing but good enough to facilitate a nice evening. Chefs are friendly to share with you how everything was prepared. Food was great, able to bring you some surprises. They put a lot of effort in preparing ever thin and you can taste the genuineness. I love the beef tartar. In Singapore not many restaurants can prepare a simple but fresh and succulent beef tartar. Lobster bisque was genuine but a bit lighter compared to others I had, but the chef shared with us that it's the way he prefers. For desert, the Citron Tart was surprising, with the gelato made of basil and lemon. Decoration was nice and so was the ambiance. A bit expensive but prepare your wallet and go for something good.

Came here for dinner. The place is nicely decorated, good ambiance, not too big and not too small. As soon as we came in the waiter asked us for our seating preference. somewhere warmer, cooler, or at the bar in front of the kitchen. This was a very nice gesture. Took us to the table and gave us the food menu, but no drinks menu, pretty rare not to be given the drinks menu first. Not a big deal. I ordered the lobster bisque as a starter and the lamb as main course. My friend ordered the crab cake and a tenderloin steak. I asked the waiter for a suggestion of wine. He was knowledgable but wanted me to pick 180$ bottles of wine, which in my mind was a bit too expensive. Eventually I stuck with a burgundy 2012. What the waiter deliver me was a 2013. Im no wine conneseiur but he ensures me its the same, doubtful, and price is the same. The wine last at this restaurant starting price is aroun 90$ and up a tad expensive for a table wine. Next we were served bread, butter, and infused salt that they make (tomato and herb).The bread was disappointing as it was cold, and just plain sourdough. no variety. The butter was hard/cold so making it rock hard.The starters were quite nice. Both the lobster bisque and crab cakes were delicious. No complaints. However onto the main. The lamb wasn't bad. IT was too fatty though, and I thought it would be lamb chops with bone in, rather than pre cut slices of lamb. it came with veggies which were good as well. For me the portion size was perfect but for some I can see how people would complain that its too small. The tenderloin was a bit overcooked, and although they said it was 250grams, it sure didn't look like it, more like 150garms. I wouldn't recommend the steak, although its normally only avail for lunch menu.The have a nice cheese table they offer after dinner. Not bad, it would be nice if the waiter would explain each of the cheeses, rather than just say quickly their names. Overall its a good restaurant, some small things to iron out. Price is decent, portion size is mediocre, wine list although extensive are too expensive overall. However I would definitely come back here again despite its short coming

Very nice restaurant where the owner is the chef. He and his staff make very good food and service was great. I had scallops for starter/main course I got a lovely slow cocked lam. Dessert a selection of 4 French cheese served with condiments. Top food and service

Fleur De Sel, a relatively-new entrant into the French fine-dining scene shows great promise with its perfectly-executed French staples. Having worked alongside acclaimed chef, Alain Ducasse, Chef Alexandre Lozachmeur brings his classic style up close to patrons by way of an open-concept “chef’s table” from which to watch the culinary action from.Start off with some freshly shucked Fines De Claire oysters served typically Parisienne style with toast on the side or dive straight into the creamy yet light Lobster Bisque that is full of flavor. Try the delicately sweet scallops or if you are in the mood for something richer, go for the unctuous Foie Gras.Another equally decadent dish is the Roasted Stuffed Quail with mushrooms and foie gras that is served in a bed of creamy, smooth potato mash.Or if you prefer a different type of fowl, go for the Slow cooked and Seared Duck Breast that gets a perfect shot of sweetness with the accompanying cherry jus and figs.Bringing you to chocolate heaven is a dish simply titled Le Chocolat that features a dark-as-night chocolate and praline ball with the eponymous Fleur de Sel Caramel and ice cream. And the traditional Baba is given a new, improved twist with the usage of Grand Marnier instead of rum – the orange liquor matching the chocolate sauce perfectly.With skylight panels overhead and elegant European fittings, one almost really feels like it is a night out at a classy restaurant in Paris. Coupled with charming service and a predominantly French and extensive wine list, this is definitely one ooh-la-la French dining experience

Visited this petit french restaurant at Tras street for a business lunch, and it was a great choice. A 3 course set lunch for S$38 is absolutely a deal. Every dishes are just artistic both for its look and taste. Good to see the chef working on those plates behind the counter. Nice atmosphere too... Would like to re-visit

This isn’t really a restaurant review. Not being real foodies, we wouldn’t even call it a food critique – reflections on a meal to remember, perhaps. Fleur de Sel is in a shophouse on Tras Street in Tanjong Pagar. The inside was well designed and welcoming without being striking; ‘intimate’ probably describes it best – the few tables (mostly two-seaters) all clustered around the open kitchen where the staff did their magic alongside the owner-chef Alexandre. The menu wasn’t extensive, although it probably changes quite often. About five choices in each section and set lunch options at two price levels ($38 & $48). Being budget conscious we picked two set lunches – one Executive and the other Fleur de Sel, as the mains on the a la carte menu were priced at roughly the level of the sets. While the food was very good, what made the meal special for us was the service. It was friendly and attentive, and felt very personal without being overwhelming. We chose tap water and declined wine without feeling cheap, and despite having chosen the lowest-priced options in the house, had each course explained to us in detail (by the chef himself, at times). On to the food. We felt the amuse bouche (deep fried rice balls stuffed with bacon, with a sun dried tomato sauce) fell short, being good but not memorable. Perhaps the fact that it was deep fried put us off just a little bit. The bread though, was outstanding. Very crusty outside and just the right kind of chewy inside, served with unsalted butter and fleur de sel (two kinds, infused with rosemary and truffle); good enough to make a meal by itself.The starters were beef tartar and duck foie gras. The beef was good but not outstanding, being soft, but not melt-in-the-mouth; the seasoning too, not quite our favourite (though that could have been our unsophisticated taste buds). The foie gras was top notch, the brioche complementing it perfectly. Our mains were a cheese-filled ravioli in a very creamy sauce and cod. While the ravioli sounds very heavy, even stodgy, it was actually quite perfect. A kind of a mini ravioli filled with a mild but creamy cheese, well complemented by the sauce. The cod was a revelation: the fish itself was fresh and cooked just right, but the accompaniments raised it to a new level – zucchini, tomato and olive with a basil sauce that formed an extraordinary combination with the fish. We expected much from the desserts and Fleur de Sel delivered in spades. The rhubarb was very French, though less tart than we expected, well tempered by the custard cream and the crumble. The baba was entirely sinful with an abundance of Grand Marnier and very rich chocolate sauce; a great way to end an excellent meal.Definitely worth a second visit, and we’ll probably quickly break our resolution not to visit the same place twice in a year. Cautions: if you have a big appetite you might find the portions small. They were perfect for us (and we don’t eat much). And when you’re choosing your seat, measure yourself first. We were recommended the bar seats (there are about half-a-dozen overlooking the kitchen) but being rather short we realised we’d be eating pretty much at chest level and asked to move to a more conventional seat. Stay with the regular tables unless you’re above 170 cm. Finally, this is not really a place for groups – a party of four would ideally be the max size.The MealAmuse Bouche: rice croquette with bacon and sun dried tomato sauceSourdough bread, unsalted butter and fleur de sel (rosemary & truffle)Executive Set LunchLe Boeuf: Beef tartar seasoned with herbs and condiments, bread crisp, petite saladLes Raviolis: French cheese raviolis with creamy truffle sauce and Parmesan cheeseLa Rhubarbe: stewed rhubarb, marinated berries, custard cream and crumbleFleur de Sel Set LunchLe Foie Gras de Canard: seared duck liver, sautée mushrooms, brioche and duck jus vinaigretteLe Cabillaud: seared Atlantic cod fish, trumpet zucchini, Kalamata olives, Roma tomatoes, cooked and raw fennel, Italian basil sauceLe Baba: Grand Marnier liquor baba and vanilla whipped cream served with chocolate sauce(visited on 8 Sep 2015

I was invited to have lunch at Fleur de Sel. I didnot know the place. Choice between table or at the counter talking to the chef , who is flexible and made lunch exactly as asked for. Delicious. If Singapore would have Michelin star rating Fleur de Sel should definitely have one 
5
being new to trip advisor perhaps a bit of an over statement but was blown away by the food service provided. the chef is the owner and he is passionately cooking away at the open kitchen. like a hawk he watches the restaurant service but the team does a stella job so no intervention need tonight. has the tasting menu and lovely home made bread with sea salts. a bottle of french red to accompany. would visit more often if i lived in singapore.must try
5
Not cheap, but excellent chef and food. Nice wines as well. The scallops are amazing, the cabillaud was good, but the desserts (le citron & rhabarbe) were absolutely top. Le citron with basil sorbet, it sounds strange, but the taste was perfect. Will go there again for some special occasion (not every week given the price, we paid S$240 for 2pax including one wine per person). The free bread they serve with butter and fleur de sel are very good as well. Also a plus: there's some corners where you can sit and where there isn't a lot of airco, something we like. Not a big place, so you might want to make a reservation.

Just when I really hankered for some authentic French cuisine, friends invited us here, to the trendy Tras Street, Singapore. Shophouses where innovative food and bars spring up. Starter: lobster bisque - beautiful, dainty portion with the bisque hand poured at the table! Great colour, smooth texture and perfect balance of fish and other ingredients. Delicious! Made my night:) Main: duck breast, thinly cut fig - more deliciousness Cheese: complete deliciousness.Highly recommend the sommelier - he gave us great advice to navigate us through their extensive wine list. All the staff are professional and very courteous. Love the interior design and the open kitchen with busy chefs- definitely will be back
5
This must be my sixth visit in the last year. Pleased to say that the food and service have remained excellent over the year. The set lunch is excellent and represents outstanding value. One of my few "excellent" reviews.
5
We have enjoyed our dinner in this restaurant. Service was excellent, food was cooked to the perfection. Waiter had good knowledge on dishes and he was able to recommend a good wine.
4
An intimate restaurant in a shop house, the tables are reasonably well spaced, the service is polished and the food is excellent. The chef is visible in the open plan kitchen and the overall experience is very good value for money. The set lunch is consistently good qne the chef makes time to talk to his customers. It is a good, local French restaurant and I wish there were more likr it in Singapore
2
We had the dinner set and found the dishes lacking in flavour. A few dishes were served rather cold when they ought to be warm/hot. The dessert was a complete disappointment. Not recommended for lovers of fine dining as this is probably more average bistro quality food. There are far better French places e.g. Jaan, Corner House and Sky on 57 than this. Worse, some of the air-conditioning were spoilt and the restaurant was hot and unpleasant. The only plus is the highly attentive service
5
Best French restaurant in Singapore. This is a small, intimate place with an open kitchen. Great service . Great sommelier . Wonderful simple but elegant French food . We had an event there with twelve guests ..who all were raving about the quality of the service, the atmosphere and of course the food . Deserves one if not not couple Michelin Star

Came here for lunch. The decor is chic and cosy, with an open kitchen. They have 2 set lunches and a la carte. We opted for the latterStarted with osyters and they were smallish but ok. My main of trout was as well cooked as can be, trout and salmon are both very easy to cook well. My friend found his foie gras starter to be smallish for a la carte, and wondered how small it would be for the set lunch. His main of cod looked good too. We shared a cheese platter and chocolate dessert. Both servings were also smallVery classically french, from the small servings, to the artisanal bread, french maitre'd, cheese trolly and even the receipt is in french only!Overall ok, and service was pleasant from start to finis

Business lunches are always a difficult way to review a restaurant's potential properly. Business lunches tend to be too quick and concentration less on food than topics of conversation.The restaurant is nicely set out with an open kitchen towards the back. Our particular table was sadly the worst on the floor crammed into a space next to the kitchen. I would definitely have asked to move had there been other available tables.A little amuse bouche of smoked duck was nicely presented and enjoyable. However it was totally overshadowed by the bread presented with butter and the namesake Fleur de sel. The Fleur de sel was incredibly good.We ordered a nice half bottle of Sancerre which was fantastic and nicely chilled. This went very nicely with starters of scallops with mushroom and arugula and crab and avocado respectively. Both starters were nicely presented and my scallops were lovely and perfectly prepared. However our waiter badly misjudged pouring the last of the half bottle leaving me with a good half glass but my dining companion with very little. Disappointing.A second course of slow cooked lamb with peas carrots and rosemary and lamb jus was a nicely presented dish once again and surprisingly light. However, my own lamb was slightly fatty whereas my dining companion had a better cut. We ordered a glass of Fleurie which was a nice match to the lamb. To the restaurant's credit the open bottle offered had peaked and the chef immediately offered to open a fresh bottle. Much appreciated.The restaurant's cheeseboard is impressive and we couldn't resist with a second glass of Fleurie. A particular mention should be made of the homemade fig(?) chutney, which was rich and sticky sweet.The dessert of rhubarb with custard cream and crumble was a let down. It felt as if the dessert preprepared many hours before and left to sit. Edges of the custard were almost hard and the rhubarb had lost a lot of its classic tanginess. If freshly prepared this dish would have been an absolutely winning dish that would have rounded off the meal fantastically.I would definitely revisit and give the restaurant a proper try where I could explore the menu and wine list a little more
5
Went there for business business lunch with few colleagues. It is real French cuisine with proper bread. We were in a private room. Every body enjoyed. The set lunch is honestly priced with dished that are not too classic and good wine list decently priced for Singapore
5
I've lived in Singapore for almost 20 years and so have eaten at many of the nice restaurants in town. Fleur De Sel has quickly become one of my favorites. It was introduced to me by a colleague ~3 years ago when at the last minute I had to book my anniversary dinner (hee hee), and my usual expensive suspects were sold out. It was a fantastic reservation. Since then I have been back perhaps another 6-8 times, usually getting one of the menus, which change if I recall correctly at least quarterly. I have enjoyed every single meal. Of course sometimes one of the courses might be only "okay", but never not enjoyable. Amongst the consistently tasty ones I'd recommend include: pan-fried scallops, lobster bisque, foie gras, slow-cooked pork belly and lobster. I've had those dishes at least 3x each. The cheese plate is also highly recommended!Lastly I should say the service has always been fantastic, Alexandre clearly trains his team well. Also Alexandre (head chef and owner) usually comes out to greet the guests either very early or towards the end, so you can engage him about the dishes
5
I went in this restaurant with my gf for a dinner, I honestly could say they really have good knowledge about food and service. Interesting and studing menu, and good selection of wines. Wonderful selection of cheeses served in perfect room temperature; noted they have an Amazing Epoisses, everyone should try it once in a lifetime. Place very clean, open kitchen very tidy and clean ( something difficult to see in Singaporean kitchens). I'm sure I will be back as soon as possible.
4
Went there with my colleague for lunch. We closed the set lunch which turned out very delicious and reasoably priced.
I quite liked the mains which is seared beef tenderloin. It was perfectly cooked and well seasoned..
Will definitely come back.
5
The salt baked fish was beautiful. Very moist. Vegetables went well with it. Nice ambience. Wine waiter a bit of a show off. Did I say how nice the fish was.
4
Our last meal in Singapore before we flew back to Australia and definitely worth the visit. 3 of us had the executive lunch and my teenage son had the a la carte rabbit pasta was very filling and tasty. The highlight for me was the zucchini soup and the cheese board which being a cheese lover( and of European origin) had some that I had never tried before. The duck and smoked trout was also well recommended. All in all this meal was the same price as our first meal in Singapore a few days ago in a very touristy area and 4 times as nice.I would definitely recommend it
5
It was a Wednesday and apparently a slow night for them. Liked the simple, cosy deco they have. Attentive service, the waiter- Shaun passed me a magazine to while away my time as I was waiting for my friend to arrive.Since it's our first time to the restaurant, we ordered a set dinner and ala carte to try more food items. Meal started with the beef tartar which was nice, but it was the lobster bisque and foie gras that totally nailed it! The bisque is tasty and creamy, yet very light. The foie gras was perfectly cooked, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Totally enjoyable!Next came the asparagus which was "normal", nothing too much to shout about.For mains, we had the Tasmanian trout and seared beef tenderloin. It's well flavoured and cooked just right so that it's juicy. However, the highlight for the whole meal to me was the tenderloin.That item was not in the dinner menu, but they suggested that from the lunch menu when we asked for smaller portion of steak (the one they had for dinner was for 2 persons). That was one of the best steaks I tried, it was so evenly done and every mouthful is heaven. I would go back just for that! Finished the meal with their grand marnier liquor baba and a cheese plate. As I'm not a dessert person, I could have done without the baba but the cheese was fantastic. They have one of the widest selection of cheese I've seen in a restaurant on that little trolley, and good quality ones too. Wine selection is good, we wanted something less than $100 and there's quite a good choice to choose from.All and all, it was a wonderful experience with the food, wine and service. And I will definitely go again
5
The chef is Michelin ' Three stars trained and it shows.. Flawless execution . Simple but wonderfully executed French meal. Perfectly cooked dishes, with just a hint of creativity ( no wild or weird combination here ..) . We had snails, warm foie gras, fantastic beef rib, wonderful duck , all of those cooked perfectly with delicate sauces on the side. The service was amazing with a great and knowledgeable Maitre d Hotel. Great and very diversified wine list. Refreshing to see that you can order a wonderful regional wine for 85 sing a bottle in Singapore . Really good desserts as well. Great decor and atmosphere. ( Modern , open kitchen ) would highly recommend, for business, friends and family

The funny thing about trip advisor is that you have to write this "title of your review" …. emmm, Im having some difficulties, with this, cause I usually like to talk more…and not only give it a title… Anyway, Fleur de Sel restaurant was really a great experience. Being a foodie and working in F&B all my life, I usually judge restaurants from different point of views, such as the guest point of view and the professional one. Well, on that night they have been definitely understaffed, which can happen, but trust me, a "normal" guest wouldn't have noticed it. The service was still efficient, friendly and fast and even the chef came out to serve, which is great and people love it anyway!After changing from the table that they gave us, to the counter seats, just in front of the open kitchen, my husband and I started the dinner. He ordered the 5 course set menu and I a la carte.Since my review is a little bit late, I can't really remember which dishes have been included in the set menu, but however, both of us have a great memory of Fleur de Sel .It was a perfect and delicate execution of french products and classic cooking methods.Light flavors and pure, clean taste. Very much our style.Besides food, their wine menu is great as well… There was no sommelier, BUT the chef. And trust me, chefs have a great palate! The wine that he recommended us was excellent and a perfect companion to our dinner.So end of the story: go and try! Merci
5
I went to Fleur De Sel Le for lunch and was seated immediately.As there were a number of interesting items in the set lunch menu, I asked my server for recommendations and he suggested the Cod Fish. After some discussion, I finally ordered the Le Foie Gras de Canard, Le Cabillaud (Atlantic cod fish), and the La Rhubarbe for dessert.The Foie Gras was excellent, one of the best I have eaten. The Cod Fish was tasty and moist, with the skin was slightly browned and crispy. The Rhubarbe was sweet and refreshing. Food portions were rather small.Service was very good. My server was friendly, attentive and unobtrusive.This is a great place for French food. Food quality is very good. Prices were on the high side
5
Went back to Fleur De Sel yesterday for a business lunch. Ordered from the $48 lunch menu - the lobster bisque followed by the French cod. Skipped dessert and opted for a selection of soft and medium cheeses from one of the best cheese boards I have seen in Singapore. Amazing quality at very reasonable prices. Chef Alex and his team inc front of house manager Francois deserve a commendation for quality and the highest level of service. Bravo!! One of the best lunches
5
Discovered Chef Alex's wonderful restaurant only this week and had to go back within 72 hours. Great food, fantastic staff, food to die for and a wine list that delivers great value. And one of the best cheese board to finish off the meal. Chef Alex is a chef to watch.
4
Came here for the set lunch today. We hadn't made a reservation and were lucky to get a place at the bar as the restaurant was totally full. Decent food and efficient service. Paid about $110 SGD for 3 courses with tea or coffee for 2 people. Worth a visit
4
We went there with some friends and the experience was great. I can advise you the quail with foie gras and the beef rib. If you like red wine try the Chinon, best price for quality.
5
Amazing....! Quality of food is brilliant, the wine selection is very good and the service is high quality... Nothing wrong to say about this place.
Their piece of beef is just coming out of a dream!
Beef lovers, this is a must!
5
liked: great lamb saddle and friendly staff; thanks for seating us without a reservation on Fri night
disliked: a bit too warm
5
Nice restaurant with open kitchen, went twice, the chef and team are very nice and efficient.Quality of products are very good and well represented. I strongly recommend for lunch as the set is a very good value for money. It is a good place also for diner with friends. My only comment is about the size of dishes which are too small especially the starter and dessert.Dessert were OK, but can be much better and bigger please....went for lunch and diner in a month...thus...good on
5
I selected this restaurant based on the TA reviews (skipping several of the restaurants nearby with good ratings, but full of false reviews. It is SO EASY for a seasoned TA writer to detected all the false comments, that I wonder if the restaurateurs who use this technique have an idea on how much damage they do to themselves....).The choice was excellent, a clear sign that when TA is used correctly it works extremely well.The street is a parallel of Tanjong Pagar Street, very close to the Amara and Carlton City hotel, and 10 minutes walk from the M Hotel. With my party of seven colleagues we arrived at 8pm, we were greeted by the maitre who guided us inside the restaurant, which has a gentle retro atmosphere. We were quickly served with the wine, one bottle of Chateauneuf du Pape and two of St. Jospeh le Granits, an uncommon Marsanne wine suggested by the sommelier. the 3 bottles, at 140 S$ each, added to the final bill but were definitively good.We were served an amouse bouche which was excellent even if a tad salty (don't ask me what it was.... but it was nice); I then had a Lobster bisque which was delicious and a Lotte (monkfish, San pietro) which was very good. All my friends commented very well on their dishes. As dessert, I had a selection of french cheese which was superb. We ordered a Sauterne Chateau Giraud, which ended a great dinner. The final bill was 1460S$, which for 8 means 180$ per eprrson. But once you remove the wine (the Sauterne was 109S$), it goes to 116$ per person which for the food we had and the ambiance we dined in, is a good price.In all, it was extremely pleasurable and highly recommended. A small recommendation to the owner: Wi-Fi pls!!!! As there is basically no phone signal inside, pls provide free wi-fi to your guests...

As regular readers will know, I am lucky enough to go to France quite frequently and indeed have a house there, so I am quite familar with French food. I am quite demanding and I know what it should be.We had been given a recommendation for this place and gave it a try.The restaurant is quite small, not that many tables and has an open kitchen so one can watch the crew going about the business of bringing one's dinner. Another time I might choose to at the counter and be on the edge of the action - another visit is highly likely.I liked the decor, quite clean and fresh, subtle prints francaise on the walls and nice earthy tones everywhere. Fine French music warbling away in the background, loud enough to hear but not intrusive so good marks for that.The menu was fairly small with a handful of starters and mains: this is a good thing in my opinion as it's a small dining room and a menu with dozens of options would worry me.The good lady opted for scallops and lamb, while I went foie gras and stuffed quail. I spotted a Sancerre rouge under $100 on the wine list which is a local wine for my house and an obvious choice.Scallops perfectly cooked, a mushroom sauce and thinly sliced sautéed mushrooms were presented, along with my foie gras. Good crust and soft interior showed they knew how to cook this sinful delicacy. A sprinkling of the signature fleur de sel ( I selected the lemon and thyme infused version) lifted it from good to damn good.The mains arrived. The lamb was prettily presented with an array of vegetables and was beautifully tender. My quail came in a bowl, stuffed with foie gras and mushrooms on a bed of mashed spuds and smothered in mushroom sauce. It did not stand a chance and it was devoured only just within acceptable boundaries.A small interlude wherein a fantastic cheese trolley was presented: it is one of my many weaknesses so I had a bit of a dabble. Rebluchon, bleue Auvergne and Compte all very good.Desserts? Rude not too.Le Baba and Le Chocolate please.The baba was soaked in Grand Marnier and cream, then hot chocolate sauce poured over at the table. Mine was chocolate and caramel praline, with chocolate ice cream. And hot chocolate sauce. It was good. Actually, it was very good.I must say, the service was very good, all the staff and management were interested in how their diners were finding the food, they seemed to really care about their restaurant and I liked that.Overall, it was a very fine meal. It is very much a return visit needed. It is as good as I would expect to find in France and that is high praise indeed

Fleur de Sel mean “Flower of Salt” which is the prime quality salt crystal, but this is the name of this french restaurant opened 1 year ago in Tras Street.It is an open kitchen concept with around 20+ seats in the cosy main dinning room and they do have a private dinning which can accommodate 12 persons. And Yes, you will see the chef cooking for you!I will call that a “delicate” classic french, as everything is home-made and well plated, I mean nothing more / nothing less…Read more:http://drinkeattrip.wordpress.com/2014/09/30/fleur-de-sel-restaurant

This was the first time my wife and I dined at Fleur De Sel. For entrées we had Les Saint-Jacques and Le Crabe. From the selection for Poissons et Crustacées we had La Lotte, and from the selection for Viandes et Volailles we had La Caille. Bread and butter were complimentary. We found the food to be tasty, and also one of the better French restaurants around in Singapore. The ambiance was nice. The deco was nicely done, giving the place a rather cosy feel. The staff were quite attentative as well as friendly. We would certainly recommend the place to our friends, especially for special occassions.

Had an Excellent dish " Le Cabillaud" the fish was superbly cooked and fresh! the dish itself was very light and refreshing, i was delighted to eat such a nice fish cooked to perfection.The Cheese selection was impressive for being in Singapore, I just returned from France / Switzerland and what was on offer at Fleur de Sel was of good standing! A place that I noted to visit again whilst on business or pleasure in Singapore
4
Having tasted the head chef's cuisine a couple of times over the last decade at different restaurants, this meal did not disappoint. A cosy restaurant that sits around 20 people, one can observe the chefs at work just beyond the bar counter.A highlight is the rosemary as well as lemon & thyme fleur de sel (salt) which was served with unsalted butter and fresh rolls, but also worked beautifully with the main course of seared beef tenderloin.A vibrant menu, warm atmosphere and reasonably priced set lunch menu. Definitely recommended
5
Excellent, inventive cooking by a young chef; Ask for " cote de boeuf" .Worthy and warmful wellcoming, one of the best french restaurant in Singapore and you can trust me , I have tried so many of them
5
I had a lovely dinner at this place with my colleagues. I had the lobster bisque and for main the mock fish. Both were very good. I like the different kinds of salt that you can use to sprinkle on bread or any of your dishes. They're perfect for bread and butter. The place is lovely. Very quiet. We had the private room at the back which worked well since we were a bit noisy
4
Ate here on a recent Tuesday night. Was a bit worried as it was very quiet. Two or three tables only. However, the restaurant looks nice, the kitchen is open and I thought the food was delicious, from the soups, quail main course and excellent stinky cheeses. Looking forward to going back soon. Decent wine list tending towards expensive but still some interesting choices
5
Being French , i am fussy when i go for French Food outside France .But that night i had a REAL treat .Food was excellent (all ingredients tasted so fresh ) and superbly presented .The menu is not too long so it is easy to chose from . My entrée (Morue ) and i had lamb as main dish was outstanding. The French chef (and apparently the or one of the owners ) knows what he is doing .He has been in Singapore more than 8 years and had about 4 positions already in different restaurant and hotels. Now he is on his own and bending over backwards to please his customers .i wish him success and i have no doubt it will be a success if he can keep up with the quality and service. important : we drank a super wine for Languedoc at sgd 85 (Pic saint Loup) which was excellent .you can bring a bottle at no cost for every bottle your order in the restaurant

had a pleasant & relaxing dinner chat with a close friend at fleur de sel on 7.5.2014. he was going to do some hiking at cinque terre & could not find his walking stick so i brought mine along for him. i heard about fleur de sel from my wife’s good friend (who bought us an excellent dinner recently at the very artisan singapore fusion restaurant started by a 29 year old investment banker, labyrinth on 30.4.2014). seemed that the whole lobster, completely shelled at S$49++ was very good here.my wife came by 2 nights ago with the same friend and took the S$88pax 4-course set menu. she felt that the escargot was not good, and it was not the cooking but the quality of the escargot itself – not sweet, tasty. she also felt the soup was average, the cod was ok good & the rhubarb dessert was good.i was decided on the lobster for myself. when my good friend arrived, i gave him my wife’s feedback & suggested he took the other S$108 set instead, as the dinner was a belated celebration of his recently past birthday. anyhow he decided to join me to order a lobster each. looking at the menu i was not attracted by the appetisers, so i suggested we ordered a cod (main) & a lapin (rabbit) risotto main to share before starting the lobster. my friend though wanted only the cod. i got him to order a wine so he got himself a cloudy bay (white).we were served semi sour dough with butter, and advised we could dab the sel (salt) too. the restaurant name fleur de sel means flower of salt, apparently hand harvested (haha..what a description!) by workers who scrape only the top layer of salt before it sinks to the bottom of large salt pans. one salt was flavoured with rosemary, the other with citron & something else. good fun…lol. we tried the salt but our palate not sophi enough & they felt non-descript. the butter was ok average so we asked for some olive oil, which was very good, very fragrant extra virgin olive oil. the amuse bouche was some crab meat, pretty good. the pan seared atlantic cod was pretty good, though the cod was firm but did not feel so smooth & bouncy, somewhat different from the texture of cod i was accustomed with. it was served with some sauce so more a wetter version (not knowing how to describe!).i guessed it was a very good cod regards this method of preparation but for me personally, the satisfaction was not at the level i had with my own nobu miso cod & teriyaki cod (whereas by comparison the teriyaki cod at mikuni & at keyaki would of course be better than mine).the shelled whole lobster in lobster bisque was very good (the dark photos above & top taken with my samsung s4 did not do justice to the dish). meat was fresh, sweet, tender & very tasty with the bisque. excellent dish this! service was very good. server knew we were celebrating my friend’s birthday so brought a small cake with 1 lit candle. it might have been expected of a good restaurant. still it was much appreciated as an important guesture that defined good service & training for a good restaurant. the apple crumble was very average non descript.the bill was S$198 for 2pax including 1 glass cloudy bay white & dessert.overall, with the exception of the lobster, i would consider the food just average for this level of dining & prices. of course it would be much better than a usual eat. on the lobster while it was really good & competitively priced, many restaurants, both chinese & western, are able to & indeed does the same, equally good & inexpensively priced.if I made a comparison with labyrinth, the latter was a lot more artisan, creative, able to reproduce the flavours from ingredients that were beautifully assembled, tasted similar but looked entirely different from the usual singaporean dishes like chilli crab etc. however, some may consider paying (say) S$90nett for whole lobster etc better deal than paying for same for labyrinth’s set, creative or not! it is a very subjective thing.won’t be back soon, but probably will have another go a bit more time later. see my full reviews & photos at = http://chefquak.com/2014/05/08/good-dinner-not-great-fleur-de-sel-on-7may2014

Been there few times for business lunch or dinner and finally I decided to say what I think....The food is perfect, nothing more nothing less... tasty and fresh, the chef can transcribe in your plate the purity of the product. Just the most fresh ingredient cooked to perfection.The service is really attentive and professional.I will not say what is my favorite as everything is good.... And the good thing is, they do not overcharge the wines...What to expect more...?!A must go back...!!

They serve a tasty sour dough bread with butter and very nice fleur de sel with different herbs. We decided to go for the dinner set and had escargots, which come slightly different than the burgundy style with some salad, which makes it a bit lighter. The asparagus soup was of extraordinary good taste, very light as they don't use dairy products for the soup. The main was a nice cod, very light too with tasty baby spinach. The Bordeaux by the glass for 16sgd was excellent for that price range. All in all a good French restaurant with tasty food in a lighter version. Next time we'll try the steak frites. The only thing I missed was a Pastis as aperitive as they don't have it.

Been there yesterday for a lunch with a friend. The place is small but that makes for a more exclusive experience. The food is quite inventive for traditional cuisine and very tasty although a bit to frugal. The service is fine and the chef is eager to make sure you truly enjoy his food! A good experience!

We went there with my wife on valentine Day. It was a unique menu for two. Food was excellent and price high but justified as far as I am concerned. (Great quantity and high quality food). The food is classical French. Howard was excellent. Beef as well and champagne granité very nice. My favorite was still the foie gras!!!! Great service.Just a note: staff seemed to have disappeared around 11.30 so the wait was starting to be quite long after that. But anyway, still a 5* for me.

For food that's flavorful and yet tells great stories I pick FDS. I was there with some friends but I know its a great romantic night out destination given the ambiance. The presentation is spot on. The bread is served with flavored salt and the amuse bouche we had was delicious. Try the foie gras appetizer if you are a connoisseur. You will love it. They have a great variety of cheeses as well.For a quiet evening give this restaurant a try
