The food was very good. I ordered prawn stir fry with vegetables and my boyfriend ordered the beef stir fry, which was recommended by the owner's father. The service is good, and the prices are reasonable, which is difficult to find in Singapore.

Walking around looking for some where to eat in Singapore we were approached by Leo as we studied the menu. We wanted to shower before diner but returned later. The service was exceptional with Leo just the perfect host. There was a good variety of Asian dishes and a few 'Western ' choices. The meal was very tasty and Leo esquires exactly how spicy you like your food. Prices were also very reasonable and the place had a nice atmosphere

Leo's was the first place we ate at when we arrived in Singapore 5 and a half years ago and the last place we ate at before we left.The food is always freshly cooked by Vicky who is always glamorous. Well worth the wait. Leo himself is the perfect host attentive and always goes the extra mile for his customers.Love this hidden gem set between the cacophony of both Little India and Bugis, which will provide a tranquil haven no matter what time of day. Strongly recommended ****

Being a new visitor to Singapore and a little unsure of the food, we chose Leo's CafÃ© after spotting some other Aussie at the front tables. The food was reasonably priced and tasty. I left my reading glasses on the table and returned later to find out that the owner had gone to a near by Hotel to see if I was staying there. The hospitality was terrific. Thank you so Much. Well Done !!

Singapore isn't renown for being cheap, so it's quite difficult to find somewhere that offers lovely food at reasonable prices. That said, Leo's bucks the trend.It's an unassuming place, with pleasant service at prices less than you'd pay at other places in Singapore which offered similar quality food. We ate at 2 other places in Singapore whilst visiting, both in Chinatown, but neither offered food, location, or service to match Leo's. They deserve to be up there on TripAdvisor!It's close proximity to the underground rail service makes it accessible from all parts of Singapore. Worth a trip to Leo's!

We went to Leo's Cafe specifically because it was rated the best Chinese restaurant in Singapore on tripadvisor. We were not disappointed! The oxtail soup was excellent, as were all the other dishes we ordered. The setting is very pleasant - a quiet patio away from the bustle of the streets. Leo was also a friendly host and spent time with us chatting, which added another nice touch. This was the first place we ate in Singapore and we'll definitely be back!

Leo's is a Chinese restaurant--but that does not say it all. The setting is lovely--outdoor tables under trees, on a beautiful plaza with twinkling lights, makes it pleasant just to sit there. Plus, in Singapore this is a very moderately priced restaurant that is also very nice--a real find in a very pricy city. Above all, the food is wonderful. Fresh, simply prepared with just the right flavors (but be warned: all Chinese food outside of the U.S. is spicier than you expect it to be---they use those tiny red peppers like we use salt, so be careful to specify caution if you want them to hold back). The service is warm and friendly. If we ever return to Singapore we'll certainlly seek out Leo's--even in this sea of good food
