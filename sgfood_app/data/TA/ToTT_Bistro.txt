A wonderful place for all day breakfast, lunch, tea, brunch and dinner. The prices are reasonable and the atmosphere is nice and quiet when it is not too busy. There is a mini play area for kids to play while parents can chill and relax.

Found this nice quiet place for a lazy Sunday lunch with friends. The food is good but I found the portions a little small and they do take their time to prepare. Notwithstanding, food quality is good for bistro food and you are not in a hurry.

A simple lunch turned out to be a pleasant surprise. The smoked chicken with home made mayo sauce is moist and delicious, which we later found out was cooked the sous vide way. My mushroom soup certainly tasted freshly made, and the NiÃ§oise salad comes in a hearty portion. Prices were very reasonable for the quality of the dishes, we will be back

A group of us had lunch here recently and tried a few of their mains. I enjoyed the pork belly rice bowl so much that I got a second. The portions is enough is you are a petite eater, the ingredients are fresh and taste delicious. Waiting time is not too bad and service decent. Will go back again for the food

A wonderful surprise at ToTT Dunearn is their bistro. After tiring yourself from looking at countless interesting items inside the store, you can enjoy their varied menu items. Salad, soup, mains and snacks are sure hits. I went for the meatball spaghetti and peach Snapple. Very good spaghetti. The meatballs were looking extraordinary but the taste complements the pasta. Satisfying, no doubt.

I went to the cafe located inside toTT store in the Sime Darby Centre for lunch on Sunday. It's in a cool and relaxed environment. There were several all day breakfast options on the menu besides some Western and local dishes. I chose the Smoked Salmon Scrambled Egg on Ciabatta set that came with coffee. It's self service where you ordered and paid at the cashier counter. Got my coffee from the machine and your meal sent to your table. The ciabatta came packed with smoke salmon, and the ciabatta was well toasted. There was also a half tomato and salad on the side. Everything tasted very good. The set was $13.90 and I got a 10% discount with POSB/DBS credit card
