The chicken was so tender like u don need to chew at all, rice was so soft and smelly so good. Source is amazing too. Everything was wonderful.
4
Overall the chicken rice is good, rank 3rd after Boon Tong Kee and Five Star. Only issue here at the Simpang Bedok branch is extremely arrogant and rude staff. More then one occurance.
3
not bad anyway. but not a must tried. just order a small plate and share with friends. so you can keep some room for other food in Maxwell Food Center.

You won't find a better Hainanese chicken rice.I live in Sydney and for years a shop inside AA served the best chicken rice. After the 90s and the closing of the store, no where else serves as good as that old place.Now this place brought back those memories and then some! its super cheap you can get a dish for about $5 and delicious sauce accompanied with the chicken
3
ive seen this place on various travel tv shows and read about it multiple times so I was quite eager to check in out in person when i was i singapore. i was there shortly after they opened and waited in a relatively short and quick moving line. I ordered what i understood to be what they are best known for - the chicken rice (white fragrant rice with slices of chicken above). I am new to hainanese style chicken rice so wasn't sure what to expect. First thing that surprised me is that the chicken is apparently intentionally served chilled. It was flavorful and decent enough but i simply can't for the life of me figure out why all the fuss and acclaims for this place. I suppose if you are there at the hawker center you may as well try it out but do not expect anything particularly amazing. as a side note, across the aisle from tian tian i ordered fried kway teow and it was just incredibly great. that is something i would stand in line for and put on tv shows
4
Yes, the chicken rice is good, and it's better than most chicken rice that I've tasted, but it doesn't give a 'wow' experience.I went to Maxwell Food Center a bit late, at 4 or 5 PM if I'm not mistaken, and when I got to Tian Tian, there was a long queue and the chicken almost run out. But I was lucky to become the last person in the queue who could still enjoy a full meal. The person behind me only ordered rice and vegetables (he looks like a tourist, and probably still insist to eat only vegetable just to taste the famous Tian Tian)
4
I think that although the food is good here, it benefits from all the media attention. Don't get me wrong, the food was good-mainly the sauce for the chicken, but there are a LOT of places to choose from here at the food center and I wouldn't restrict myself to just one on my next visit. In other words, I ate too much and would eat smaller portions from other stalls next time
3
Tian Tian has always been in the list of the top places to visit in Singapore so I was really excited to go to the place. You can see how popular it is through the long lines that stretch out to the back of the hawker center. Of course we got their Hainanese chicken. The taste was just so so. It was also served cold so that bit was really disappointing. Maybe it's because I was already hyped up because of all the vloggers mentioning how good it is to eat here..but I was disappointed. I think it's overrated. The food is cheap tho so that's an up side
5
We traveled to the Maxwell Food Centre specifically for this meal. It cost us about $15 Singaporean for a plate of chicken, two bowls of rice and some veggies. It was really delicious and tender- not sure if it was the sauce but it was worth it. I could have ordered more but wanted to compare other chicken rice in Singapore. I would recommend and would go there again. We got there around 10.30 am and it was a very short line ...not sure how busy it would be at lunch
4
Quite a queue at Tian Tian when we arrived one Saturday afternoon. Mostly local clientele. But line was moving quickly anyway so we decided to join the queue and finally get a chance to taste their chicken rice. We got a simple combo of half roast chicken, rice and bean sprouts. Chicken was tender, tasty, and mainly meat without much bones. Rice was flavorful and matched perfectly with the bean sprouts. Enjoyed our first dining experience here. Tian Tian isnâ€™t just hype. It is honest to goodness hainanese chicken rice with plenty of flavorful condiments. I recommend pairing your meal with lime juice. Will definitely be back.
1
Not nice not providing soup. Rice is just so so but chicken is fine. Extra rice need 80 cents comparing to other stall is 30cents expensive.No feeling of any gang dong as recommended by others eaters.
5
During our stay in Singapore we stopped by this tourist spot and had the recommended dish. We had a chicken and rice between us and it was lovely, best one we had during our stay in Singapore, stupidly cheap too considering.
3
Hainanesse chicken rice with bean sprouts from Tian Tian hainanesse chicken rice for $ 5. Thought it would be tastier as this is one of the more popular chicken rice shops.
450 Clementi Ave 3 120450
Open Tues-Sun 10am - 8pm
5
I’ve been in Singapore for a little over a week and this has been the best chicken rice that I’ve had. It’s a very well known and touristy spot but the line is worth it
4
Went here based on recommendation from my Uber driver. There was a slight queue but it moves quick. The chicken rice was really good, thoroughly enjoyed it and would definitely go back for more.Have not tried it against other competitors so difficult to rate 5/
3
There was a queue during lunchtime but it moved briskly. Tian Tian claimed they did not have any soup the day I visited. I had taken a tray but was told I did not need it (no explanation given), handed a plate of chicken rice and then summarily dismissed. They did not bother to mention anything about the soup until I went back to ask about it. It was very off-putting. The chicken was tender but not that special compared to Tong Fong Fatt. I think I will try the stall beside it (Ah Tai) next time as it is opened by Tian Tian's owner's relative who used to work at Tian Tian. It is cheaper and it comes with soup
4
We visited on a stopover while in Singapore. As a fan of Anthony Bourdain I felt I should give this place a try.There was a queue formed when we arrived, so we waited in line. We opted for the Chicken Rice with the chilli sauce to accompany it. It was really good and worth the wait
4
We ventured into Maxwell Food Court and saw a long line at this stall. So we bought the much touted Chicken Rice and it turned out to be very good. The chicken meat was tender and very tasty. The rice was well seasoned and good. I could have eaten another order except the line got too long when I was ready. I would come back and eat this food again
5
This place has ruined all other Hainan chicken and rice for me. It was so good I came back here 3 times during my trip in Singapore. Tian Tia is located in the Maxwell Food Centre. There will be a long que during peak hours. The line will move fast though and they are efficient at what they do. They have two sections to their stall. On the right is where you place your order. If you ordered takeaway, they will prepare your food and you pick it up right there. If you ordered to eat there. Take your ticket and go to the left side of the stall. Hand them your ticket and they will prepare your food.There were four of us in the group so we ordered half chicken and 2 orders of rice. It was fairly inexpensive. Came out to $13 SGD (about $10 USD). There was plenty of food for the four of us. Not too filling so we could try other places inside the food centre.The chicken was tender and moist. My favorite part was the skin. It was cooked so well it melted in your most. Here in the states I never eat the skin but I couldn't help myself there. If you enjoy the gelatinous texture, make sure you have the skin. The sauce was a bit spicy. So if you're sensitive to spice, be careful. For me the spice was just right.I can't wait to go back again. This was by far one of my favorite dishes on the whole trip. Do not skip this on your trip to Singapore
5
It was worth finding this little gem as it really is the best chicken rice. We went back 2nights in a row it was so good. There are other good options at the Maxwell centre so you can get a good selection to try different things.
5
Always visit here when in Singapore and try to come early before the crowds although the line does move pretty quickly.
The chicken rice is still one of the best in Singapore. Have had it elsewhere in Singapore and none were as good.
5
In the hat you read about the best Location for Singapore checken. We go there two Times. And they werde closed, But we try other Restaurants at Maxwells and they werde cheap and the Food was also ok. I would recommend this
5
The chicken rice was so good I came back twice. At only $3.50 for a small, which is plenty for one person, it is an absolute bargain. I feel sorry for the other vendors at Maxwells selling chicken rice though as there is a always a queue at Tian Tian but nowhere else
4
Located in the Hawker Centre, you only have to look for the stall with the queue lined up around the side. Rice was cooked in chicken broth and very tasty and chicken was flavorful and steamed to perfection. No wonder that Chef beat Gordon Ramsey in the cook-off competition! This is not fancy dining, but you will see where all the business and locals eat lunch. Take some moist towelettes and dry issues with you since the food stalls in the Hawker Centre do not provide. Note that there is no air conditioning, but totally worth the experience
4
The chicken rice was undoubtedly delicious as the rice was very fragrant (from the chicken stock used to cook the rice I presume) and the chicken flesh being smooth and tender as it was cooked for just the right amount of time. However, at SGD5 a plate, I felt that it was rather expensive for a plate of chicken rice in a food court. Worth trying at least once nevertheless
4
Your visit to Chinatown will not be complete without tasting this Michelin starred dish. Better to go here before lunch time as line gets crazy long but will be worth it. The chicken is really tender and flavorful plus the ginger sauce is a nice compliment to the dish, though their chili sauce is way too spicy for my taste
4
Went to Maxwell outlet....rice was full of chicken flavour , a bit ‘spicy’ from all that ginger taste and oily.Love the chili sauce... what would have made it better if they serve it will a small amount of thick dark soya like other Hainanese chicken rice & a bowlOf soup to make it seem like a more complete meal.... as good as if not better than the $30 chicken rice from chatter box marina mandarin hotel
4
Visited this place for late lunch and had the half chicken with chicken rice. It was very delicious! Probably the best chicken rice I have eaten during my visit to Singapore. The chicken was steamed nicely, soft and succulent and the rice was fragrant and tasty. Because it is in a Hawker Centre, be prepared for the Hawker ambiance. No air condition, crowded, share tables and long queues. But worth it to try the chicken rice
4
Read a lot of reviews on this stall. Customers must remember the chicken is served in room temperature. To keep it hot will mean the chicken will be over-cooked. To compensate, make sure the rice is hot. If you are lucky, you may get the chicken that have just been removed from the boiler. This is the same for most of the chicken rice in Singapore. Have been eating here for more than 20 years. Preparation and boiling the chicken was done by Mr Lai until he left a few years back when he could not get along with the owner's siblings now running the stall. He opened his own 2 stalls down the same row: the chicken is just as good, the queue is short or non-existing. It is also cheaper although I prefer Tien Tien chilli source. Can try it if you are in a hurry
4
We came here around 6pm for an early dinner (given our jetlag) and there was absolutely no line. The chicken was good, and I was also lucky to get a piece with no bone in it. The bok choy veggies we ordered as a side were a good addition and well seasoned. Overall, a very cool experience in Singapore’s Chinatown, despite the construction going on around the marketplace. If it’s your first time having chicken rice, keep in mind the chicken comes cold
4
In a city where Singaporeans will always argue about which spot serves the best Hainanese Chicken Rice, I think they can agree that this place serves one of the best.
3
We took a long time for waiting, more than one hour. Chicken rice is ok, but I think that it is overrating. 6/10
5
Arrived here at the lunch time peak for a must-try Singapore experience and was not disappointed. Despite the long line, it did move quickly and the meal was delicious. The beauty of chicken rice is its simplicity and this was simply done well. We thoroughly enjoyed lunch here (along with a pint of Tiger) and would definitely visit again when in Singapore
1
Ordered medium chicken rice and a side of beansprouts. The chicken was a chopped up back segment with virtually no meat, just all bone. The beansprouts contained a pubic hair. Overall not that great and certainly not worth queuing up for. The lady who served me was also rude.
4
Before heading to Singapore, my better half did all kinds of research, where to go, what to see, what to eat. Various forums and video pointed to Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice in Maxwell Food Centre.We made our way to the Maxwell Food Centre one night, but, from the across the road, and due to ongoing works, the whole place looked like it was shut. Luckily, we spotted a small sign saying that it was still open, so after navigating the disruption, we found our way in.Doing a quick circuit, we found Tian Tian, and were slightly dismayed at the length of the queue. It stretched around the corner, and almost back outside. As it queued, more and more people joined, more and more unhappy looking faces, making their way to the back of the queue.However, it moved fairly quickly, we must have been perhaps 30th in line, but we were at the front within perhaps 15 to 20 minutes.What did we order? Why we ordered the Hainanese Chicken Rice.We found somewhere to sit, got a giant coconut filled with coconut water (for $3 Singapore), and tucked it. The chicken rice was delicious. The meat was moist and tender, and the rice was very, very tasty.As we dined, hungry looking tourists came over to ask what we had ordered and whether it was worth joining the queue. A poor woman, who was carrying two orders of chicken to her table, dropped one, and was almost in states of despair, as she contemplated re-queuing - the food is good, but not that good.Overall, it was nice food that totally hit the spot, however, I've had Hainanese chicken elsewhere, including Hong Kong, China, and Newcastle, UK, and I can't honestly say that one was better than the other. However, it was cheap.It was just a nice dish. Worth queuing for? Only you can answer that. I was happy with the 20 minute wait, and the queue was moving fairly fast. If it was slow going, then I'd probably have bailed and gone for something else at a different stall
5
The Maxwell food centre has been renovated for years, but that doesn’t stop the queues at Tian Tian, about 20 minutes to the front of the line, but great chicken rice that doesn’t blow the bank.$5 sing for chicken on top of fragrant rice with a mild sauce and a container of chilli — it’s worth the wai

Chicken Rice is one of the Singapore dishes that every visitor to Singapore must try. And Tian Tian is up there amongst the very famous.At one time this place was voted number one by local foodies. Anthony Bourdain, an American celebrity chef, loves it. Personally I would say it is good but there are others equally good or better.Tian Tian was one of the stalls the government shipped lock, stock & barrel to one of those Singapore Day events in the USA. I was tucking into the chicken rice at Maxwell Food Centre and narrating this to my colleagues when two ladies sharing the table interrupted me: "Sorry, but we cannot help but overhear you. We want to clarify that this was arranged by the Prime Minister's Office, us!"The queue can be long and finding a free table difficult. But if you don't like the queue, you can check out Tian Tian's direct competitor, Ah Tai, 3 stalls away. Ah Tai was Tian Tian's cook for 20 years until he was fired. Apart from the chicken, I also like the liver and gizzard. Try them. But recently I found that Tian Tian has opened an air conditioned outlet at Simpang Bedok. Address: 12 Jalan Pari Burong Singapore 488678. Opening Hours: 10:00am – 9:00pm (Tues – Sun).I find the chicken at the Simpang Bedok outlet even better! So I end up eating here or buying back
4
I was so excited to try this food, because lots of reviews said it’s a must to try this food.. i arrived at 5 and i think i was the last customer.. after I ordered, they prepared to closed the counter. Located in maxwell (like food court).Overall, the rice was the best!! The chicken was littlebit uncooked, because i can still see the blood inside..If you never try this dish, you can try for once.. but for reorder in the future, not that excited anymor
5
I dont know whats the magic behind this chicken rice. This dish is so simple but yet so tasty. This goes well with the chili sauce and fermented chili. The chicken has a perfect texture and the rice is so flavorful with it's magic sauce. This is a must try
4
This is a popular place as seen on the line at lunch time. It took about 15 minutes to order and get the Chicken Rice. And the line continued at the same length after we found tables and finished lunch. Over all the chicken is moist and tender and the rice was delicious, Because it is loaded with garlic. Yum. Skin a little fatty as I can do without. It must be good from the long lines. My wife still prefers the Costco breasted chicken. Which is still a better value even in Singapore
1
Only thing nice is the rice.
-Chicken is not fully cooked
-Price @$3.50, usual ~$2.50-$3
-Rude staff
-Staff complained when I ask to add some parsley. 😔
Good Chicken rice is abundance in Singapore, not sure if raw chicken is their style.
4
Went to this famous restaurant before lunch time and the queue already long. Ordered chicken rice size medium. The hainanese rice is delicious but the chicken is standard for me.
5
For $2.50 USD you get a plate of rice and chicken plus hot sauce. Delicious, velvety tender and fresh. how can you beat the price? Went right around 11 am before lunch crowd. Add a fresh juice like sugar cane and you are set.
5
The food I eaten chicken drumstick, it very tasty and tender. Price also reasonable. We will recommend for my friends and will comeback whenever I visits Singapore.
5
I think Tian Tian chicken is always consistent with its servings and offers a delicious dish to any customer who is keen to try Singaporean chicken rice
4
For those who love chicken rice you can go to this place as this offer you best chicken rice. The tenderness of the chicken is something that we love also the price is not so high. But maybe avoid to come here during lunch time since the queing will be long
3
I don't get it. The chicken is room temperature and lacks any flavor. Mixed with a rice that is good but nothing worth queuing over. Maybe there is a subtly I am missing with this place but it did not leave me with anything worth remembering
4
Heard about this place which is famous for chicken rice. Went before early around 11 a.m. plus before lunch hours. There was a queue of mostly locals already. Ordered half a chicken , rice and bean sprouts. Chicken was very tender but I like the rice better as it has the ‘chicken flavour ‘ and not too oily. The bean sprouts was a very good match
5
This place serves excellent Hainan chicken rice! One has to try it if in town! The line is always long, but if comes early when it opens at 11am, one can save a lot of time waiting. Highly recommend the chicken drumstick plate! The portion is small, so order a veggie side or get something else at the food center, if necessary! $4.30 a chicken drumstick plate, and the food is totally worth the price! I wish I had more when I was there! Recommend time to spend at Maxwell food center is 1-2 hours.
4
For the rice and chicken it had to be this place and this place only of course. So join the long queue to get your rice and chicken. Nice, but for me not something that special and I am sure many of the other stalls in the neighborhood can get you just as good a meal
3
I remember having this years ago finding it very yummy with great texture and taste. However, this time around is a big disappointment. It's very average. I find the rice much tastier then the chicken, which is kind of sad.
5
we were recommended to this hawker food place, i ask which is the shop? and the taxi driver said before you get into the food centre you will see a long quete to the shop
3
The food tastes ordinary just like any hainanese rice around Singapore. It may be just overrated and can’t understand why people stand the long queue when the servers are so rude and snob!
5
Smooth chicken, yumm sauces, yummy rice. Must try the bean sprout vegetables. Need to queue a bit, but it's with the wait.
3
It was my friend and I's first time to visit and eat at Maxwell Food Center and at Tian Tian Food Stall. We noticed that the long was very long upon our arrival so we checked out what the fuss was about. We saw that it was tried out by the famous Anthony Bourdain so we trusted that the food must be delicious. However, we were a bit disappointed upon trying their Hainanese Chicken Rice. It was a bit bland and we found nothing spectacular about it. It was just ok for me given that we have tried other Hainanese Chicken Rice that tasted much more delicious. I may eat here again to check if their cooking has improved
3
I heard a lot about this Tian Tian chicken rice. The comments are mixed with good, average and bad opinions. I was there at lunch time on a weekday at Maxwell and the queue was quite long, maybe 40 people. It was faster than I expected, it took only 30-40 mins for my turn. While waiting you should think what to order exactly, to save time for others in line, and the lady who takes orders is impatient. They only sell Hainanese chicken, but you can choose to have chicken on top of rice (3.5 dollars) or whole chicken, half chicken, wings, drumsticks, etc. I ordered half chicken (12 dollars) with 2 plates of rice (0.70 each) and bok choy with oyster sauce (4 dollars) as a side dish. The lady gave very little sauce for 2 people, way too little for half chicken, same amount of sauce as people who have a single dish. I asked for more and she looked a bit upset. The chicken is super oily. The chicken is tender and so juicy, almost melts in the mouth. The rice is too bland for Thai tastes. The sauce is sour. I love the tenderness of chicken but apart from that I think Chicken rice in Thai style is better in my opinion. The branch at Maxwell food court is always busy. There are other branches that you won't wait long
4
Unless you go at like 10 AM in the morning (there will still be a queue, but reasonable waiting time of less than 20 minutes), then don't bother queuing as you'll be waiting for over an hour at least.We were on a foodie day out so got a medium chicken rice for $5 to share. A few pieces of succulent chicken, spicy chilli sauce and well balanced rice. It was good but there are similar places serving similar quality without the wait. Place is a bit hyped up
5
My sister showed my cousin her "must-try" list of eateries in Singapore and the number one restaurant on that list for "Hainan Chicken" was Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice at Maxwell Food Centre. My cousin googled it and found out that it was only around 10 minutes walking distance from their BNB so we could all go there for lunch today. I would not say that it was the best Hainan chicken I had tried but it was really excellent: the breast portions were tender and the soy sauce had the right texture and level of saltiness. Tian Tian is a Michelin Bib Gourmand recommended restaurant
4
After a few friends recommending this place and reading good reviews online, we decided to head to Tiantian for a quick early lunch. It is located in Newton Food Hall which is a typical Singaporean food hawker market with good and cheap eats. We've learnt that when you walk into any food hall, just look for the long lines and you will find the famous shops in that particular one. Tiantian also had a fairly long line when we went and the wait was around 15-20 minutes. Once you get to the cashier, you pay and the food comes quick. The dish was simple and tasty, with chili sauce and cucumbers on the side. The chicken was tender and light. The aroma of the rice for me was on the light side and could have been a little more fragrant. But overall is was very good. I wouldn't say it's the best Hainanese chicken rice I've had but for the price, it's pretty good, so it's worth a visit when I'm Singapore!
4
The chicken quality is good. We ordered the whole chicken for $24 only. The sauce has made the chicken taste better. One more point, the rice has been cooked to suit my favour. The only 10 marks deduction is due to the surrounding and the indoor temperature. Anyway, if having good and comfortable environment, just one dish of chicken rice (for 5-6 pieces only) may cost you that $24.
4
Review by Dr Sim. One of the Best Chicken Rice outlets in Singapore. Not the best. Celebrity Chef Anthony Bourdain ate there. Long queue during lunch. Better to eat early or at 3pm. Tourists could try. Self Service. No Air-conditioning. Regards Dr Sim
4
If you time your lunch with the local worker be prepared to wait. Just after 11 id a good time to be here. The chicken was very good but the rice is super tasty
4
Lined up for 20mins for their popular hainan chicken and it was good, but I've had better around Singapore
4
I know a lot of people complain about the wait we came just before the opened and waited about 10 minutes. Now onto the food.Wow the rice is simply incredible and the chicken while it looks well not to appetizing to be honest tastes fantastic. In fact I tried to go back for a 2nd helping before I left Singapore but unfortunately it was closed when I returned. You cant beat the price either
3
Every tour book I read and even this TA site have this place as THE place to go for hainanese chicken rice. So, when I was in Chinatown, I had to seek this place out. I was disappointed. First, there is a line of about 20 minutes to even order. The only place in the center with any kind of line this long. Second, the main guy there is a rude overworked person who fails in customer service, mainly because he can I suppose. You pay at one place pick up your food at the next line 5 feet down when your number is called.Of course I ordered chicken and rice. Not one publication or site told me that the chicken is served cold, not warm. The rice is warm. I would typically not have cold chicken for lunch on a place, maybe on a sandwich. Getting past that, it was just average to me, not as tasty as others had said here and elsewhere. The rice was flavorful, not wonderful though. The chicken comes in different sizes and is priced reasonably.No ambience, lousy rude service, in a factorylike setting with average food just didn't work well for me. Perhaps I am in the minority. I would say go somewhere else even in Maxwell
3
It a nothing to shout about chicken rice stall.Most other chicken rice stall sell the same taste and same experience food less the queue.They just have the opportunity to have lot of interview to make itself famous.Donâ€™t waste time queuing for a over rated stall
3
try ate here for lunch, queue was around 45 mins.i ordered portion chicken rice, came with WHOLE chicken with a bowl of rice.she ask do i want veggie, i say no, but she just add the veggie in the end #facepalm.the auntie seems push-sell the item.the rice was above standart, very good. also the chilly sauce really pack a punch.but the chicken i must say, quite standart.the veggie was cold as fridge.$2 for rice$25 for chicken WHOLE$7 for rip off veggie ( small portion )will come back for the rice
5
I Want to tell my experience of Tian Hian hainanese chicken rice.After queuing a little bit we have been rewarded by a half chicken with rice. This one was so tender and juicy, and the rice was very flavory. I really recommand this hawker at Maxwell Hawker food
5
I never used to really like eating this type of chicken rice as I found a lot of places make it far too fatty. But Tian Tian chicken rice is perfect. My favorite by far. Can't wait to go back!A small tip , the stall 2 down , Ah Tai is also quite good. So if Tian Tian have sold out, which often happens, try there. I find Ah Tai actually has better soup, but the actual chicken and rice are better at Tian Tian
4
I have tried so amny chicken rice but this one is another thing. The smooth buttery rice will left you mesmerized! Their chicken also very tender and smooth... They have S,M, and L size. Do expect veeerrrry long queue at lunch time. But their service is quick so it doest matter. Because it is in a hawker place, you might find a bit hard to find table to eat. Dont worry, people are nice to share their table. You gotta try this one
5
As expected, Tian Tian is a restaurant that you can't miss, especially if you're a fan of Hainanese Chicken. Easily accessible from the Chinatown MRT station
5
Not a fan of poached chicken, however this place was awesome. Don't let the blandness of the food fool you. Very tasty, yet simple meal and cheap
4
Decent hainanese chicken rice, but not going to blow your taste buds away. Definitely worth trying if the queue is short, otherwise not worth the time and effort.
4
I've been getting the hype about this place long before I visited Singapore so we just had to give it a try.We got there around 1:30pm and was greeted by a long queue to order our share of their famous chicken. We were in line for about 15-20 minutes. Ordering is quick and easy and the food is ready within a minute after ordering.The chicken was pretty good! Very well cooked and delicious! We had the half chicken and it was more than enough for 2 adults to share and 2 orders of their chicken rice. The rice could have been better. Our total bill was about 13 SG.It's definitely worth a try!
4
Be prepare to queue amazing business just chicken and rice bought the Med: $5.00 chicken and rice ,found a seat in the food court enjoyed my dish, simple and tasty rice come with cucumber slivers plus spicy hot sauce good dish worth every cents ,great value for Singapor
5
You can tell by the lines of people waiting for their chicken rice, that it is going to be good! In fact, it is better than good. Its DELICIOUS!You would be mad to visit Singapore without a serve of chicken rice.. Its a daily diet for me when I am there
4
Located in a pretty spacious food court Tian Tian is not hard to find.. We were there around 5:30pm (not the usual dinner time) yet there was already a queue though not a long one. Everyone in our family was satisfied gastronomically. Will definitely come back next time we are in Singapore
5
Once you reached the food court, you could easily identified this restaurant by seeing the long queue. The service was efficient, so you did not need to spend very long time lining up. The chicken rice was soo good, the rice is fragrant, the chicken was so soft and tasty
5
One of my favorite 3 chicken rice stalls. A must go when I am in the Maxwell Road area. It's very famous where I see bus loads of tourists arriving; forming a queue that can be 30mins long.So going very early is a must to avoid the wait in this rather hot non-aircon Maxwell food centre. 11am should be best to avoid both the regular lunch crowd & tourist buses.I am impressed with the efficiency of the production line. The food is consistently good & cheap.Alan LeongSingapore

Stranded on a deserted island and if I can only have one kind of dish it will be Tian Tian's boneless Hainanese chicken rice. I can literally eat this every day! One would wonder why for over the past three decades, every day, locals and foreigners alike would flock to hot, stuffy, and crowded Maxwell Food Center to wait in long lines just to eat at Tian Tian instead of their formidable competitors, many of whom have their own air conditioned restaurants. Bourdin and Ramsey who are admirers did help but Tian Tian was great before being discovered by these celebrity chefs.IMHO, they succeed because they excel in the main three ingredients of Hainanese Chicken Rice 1) Amazingly fragrant yet flavorful rice steamed to perfection in chicken stock. 2) Perfectly poached chicken, so tender with slippery skin, impeccably drenched in delicious sesame based sauce 3) Sumptuous condiments - fragrant but subtly tangy chicken rice chili sauce, dark soy sauce, and delicious fresh ground ginger mix. All these ingredients combined to provide a savory satisfaction with every mouthful that brings joy to the soul.My family and I have made multiple visits to Singapore over the years and we made it a necessary food pilgrimage to eat at Tian Tian with each visit. Yes we have eaten at their worthy competitors but Tian Tian is always our favorite

The chicken was juicy, rice was good, was it worth the hype? Hmm i have to say I prefer other chicken rice. can't complain though, good satisfying chicken rice 😁
4
Given the reviews this was a must try on our food itinerary.
It was nice, but not wow as I was expecting.
Big line but it moved quickly.
4
Not too sure what all the mega hype is about, but this is better than average for chicken rice. Rice is fragrant, chilli is pretty spicy and the chicken is flavoured really well.
5
This is one of my favorite cheap eats in Singapore. Maxwell Rd Hawker Centre is centrally located adjacent to Chinatown. There are heaps of places that do Chicken here - but Tian Tian is the best in my opinion.
5
Had great brunch here simple but very tasty food chicken with the Ginger and rice is so tasty Tea is good and so is morning glory.

We've been trying to eat for the past 4 years but every time we went to Maxwell Food Centre, they were shut or the queue was just too long. To our amazement, we passed through the Food Centre on the way to our hotel to collect our bags and head for the airport on our last trip and lo, they were open and even more amazingly, they was no queue at 5pm on a Sunday.We get the delicate flavour, we get that this is Singaporean comfort food but to be completely honest, we preferred the chicken rice from Ah-Tai a few stalls down. Maybe, Ah-Tai is tweaked for a different palate but we felt the dish needed the sauces that Ah-Tai offered.Grab a Tiger beer from the T3 beer stall opposite (boy, does that guy know how to work his customers) and finish with a goreng pisang banana fritter from Lim Kee or the fried dough balls dusted in icing sugar on the opposite row of stalls (about 5 up from the craft beer place)

We visited Tian Tian Hawkers restaurant on our Chinatown walking tour and were told that this was the place to go for Hainanese Chicken Rice and that since we were early we would beat the rush before it all sold out.Luckily it was also explained how they prepared and cook the Hainanese Chicken Rice so we were prepared for the actual chicken to be cold. It was quite tasty and I’m glad I tried it but it didn’t wow me.Good experience though to eat at the hawkers centre and share a table with a few of the locals, who did give us strange looks but were very friendly

Brought my USA friends and his family to maxwell as they wanted to try this chicken rice stall. 1. Food served is cold2. Service attitude cold as their food. Request for three empty plates and don't bother to answer. (not crowded; no queue)ask again and this staff turn to next staff and said hey she wants three empty plates can or not ah. The staff looked at me and ignore. I ask them why can't? Then that staff inside whispered OK. 3. Not so cheap. Don't order oyster veg and bean sprouts as waste of food. As a Singaporean this is my first time patronized them and it will be last. And so do my US friends. Try the next row BBQ pork and Roast Pork a totally delicious even for my US friends to enjoy.
4
We came here after reading the reviews about the chicken rice. There was a lengthy line spanning outside the building but it moved quickly. Tasted good and enjoyed a great drink across the hallway. Had heard from a local friend after our visit that it is very touristy and not many locals visit. Still was worth the visit.
2
this place has owned too much reputation I missed it out 7 years ago and finally hunt it down this time. I ordered the 1x Hainan Chicken Rice. but somehow I naturally thought they will give me drumstick part of it but I got chicken breast. and the staff wont ask you if you didn't request for drumstick. the most important part - the rice - it is cold, lack of the foundation fragrance (ginger and oil - you know that special combination of condiment ) of rice. nothing tastes special that will convince you for the long queue being lined up therevery disappointed
5
Went on a Sunday early lunch. No queue. Price for medium Is $5.00 per plate. While chicken is $24. The rice is moist, flavorful and fluffy. The chicken is tender.
5
I went there for lunch and spotted this stall full of people so i just tried to eat here and it was very good, fulfill my hunger of Asian food. Great taste 😀
4
This is my second time to try this restaurant, last time, the rice is not good.
However, the food is back to normal, I ordered the chicken leg rice, really tasty, chicken is soft, rice is good!
5
This was such a fun gem to find. My friend mentioned the longest lines are the best food and she wasn't kidding. It was pretty quick and so affordable. So chicken was so tender and delish!! Would eat there everyday.
3
Heard of this chicken rice and rated as "must try singapore food ", and went for it during one of the weekdays and before the lunch crowd. Queue usually starts 11.30am.
5
best chicken rice ive ever had, so moist and flavoursome, adding with the two sauces given of enhances the flavours even more.
5
the chicken rice was very yummy even i bought takeaway and ate it after two hours. The price was cheap, just 2 sth or 3 sth singapore dollars.
5
I've eaten some hainan chicken rice around HKD100+ , this is quite similar to most of the good chicken rice I had before, but given that the price is just SG5, undoubtedly it's well worth the priceLast time there's too many people when I came around lunch hour so I didn't have enough time to wait in line. This time I come around 10ish am, no waiting, yay, good food taste even better if there's no waiting.
4
This is what most of us have been waiting for to eat in Singapore. The Anthony Bourdain's approved hainanese chicken rice, Tian Tian! The queue is long, but no worries because Singaporeans serve customer with lightning bolt speed. Finally I got to taste the famous chicken rice. It turns out to be a OK. Not very special, but it still delicious. The chicken is soft, not smelly. The rice is good, but I have had better hainanese rice.We ordered a couple portions of vegetable, a baby pok choy I think and bean sprouts. The vegetable is fresh. Nicely cooked and seasoned. Overall, it is a great tasting chicken rice, but not over the top. Maybe Anthony Bourdain hasn't been to every hainanese chicken rice in Singapore.

Chicken Rice is the official unofficial dish of Singapore. Everyone says you have to try it when you go to Singapore so we decided to try out the most famous place in the city.Of course there was a line here, but the service is really fast. I got the chicken rice for $3.50 SGD. The chicken is almost like a sou vide preparation where it is barely cooked with a savory sauce poured on top of it and the rice.It wasn't my favorite dish, but it was tasty. I think the popularity has more to do with it being a traditional comfort food for locals. The one thing that locals really like, but others don't' really understand why they love it so much. Maybe my tastes are the weird one and everyone else likes it. I suggest you try it for yourself

1 of the 4 Famous #Singapore Hainanese Chicken Rice
Earned "Michelin Star" sometimes ago
Beated Chef Gordon Ramsay during "Singapore vs Ramsay"
5
Long queue but worth the wait. The portion is enough for 1 person, and the taste is so awesome! Price is still okay. Definitely will come back
4
Have to queue about 25mins but thats totally okay, tasty and reasonable price. Sucullent chicken meat and fragrant rice. Worth the value !
5
Read from the internet it is one the best Hainan chicken in Singapore. Didn't have me disappointed at all. Up the standard and its just 6 SGD.
Best Hainan Chicken I have ever had. Can't even find any comparables in Hong Kong.
3
On some days the chicken is done to a tender perfection, on other days it comes out a little bloody. Lacking Quality Control
3
We tried the Chicken Rice for which this place is famous but couldn't really tell the difference between their version and many others, always served with plain, tasteless rice. Also we are not fond of the fatty boiled chicken skin that comes with it.
5
I'd heard about this stand at this Hawker stand at the Maxwell Food Centre from a Singaporean friend. I wasn't disappointed. I went a few times during my stay and my particular favourite was soy sauce chicken rice. and the cost - just 3 Sing dollars. Fantastic value
4
Not the best Hainanese Chicken but pretty darn close. The chicken was both tender and moist, the best part of the meal was the rice. Never had chicken oil rice so flavorful, this place is worth a try. Don't expect good service and you'll have to wait in line before ordering. But for the money and taste, this meal was definitely a highlight on my trip to Singapore
1
As someone who grew up in Singapore, chicken rice is my favourite dish EVER. So of course I had to try it from the stall that gained its fame from both Gordon Ramsay and Anthony Bourdain!Unfortunately, I was severely disappointed. The chicken wasn't tender and the rice didn't taste consistent, even from the same plate (some parts with sauce, most parts bland). My friends said it used to be good, especially the rice, but they probably got arrogant after the win (which is also reflected by staff's attitude) and hence the major drop in standard. Probably one of the worst, if not worst, chicken rice I've ever had in Singapore. Save your $$ and go somewhere else - even the most average places serve better-tasting chicken rice
4
It was good and some of the pieces was great while some of the pieces were just ok. The red sauce made the chicken more flavorful. I was little bit disappointed with the rice to be honest - it wasn't that flavorful and texture was just ok. Nevertheless I'm still glad I tried it
2
Way over rated, unfriendly, dry, way to fatty chicken, sauce was bland and so was the rice. So happy I isn't have to wait more then 10 minutes in line.
2
Overated given the hype and long queue. Chicken was cold, rice and veggies were good. Visit in quiet times or go to other hawker stalls, it's only plain steamed chicken so will probably be same taste and standard.
5
Very tasty and very tender chicken. The rice is delicious too. must try it !!! There is always a long queue, BUT maybe only 10 minutes wait since the staffs there are very fast.
4
In side the Maxwell Food Center food stall. Relatively cheap chicken rice compared to restaurants. Although very tasty, could be better if more hot.
4
the chicken and rice are good!SG$5 for a dish.but the stall people is a bit mean, he took away the tray i got for carrying my food.he insisted i could just carry the dish and cutlery without the tray.they need to pay for washed trays?
4
Managed to find the Hawker Centre which was a little difficult with all the construction going on. But the noise, the heat and the food was worth it. Fragrant rice, gelatinous chicken and the experience was complete. I'm no foody, so I can't tell a good chicken rice from a great one, but it was yum!! Went at 4:45 for early dinner and there was no line but by 5:20 the hawker centre was getting busy. Lots of other great food in the hawker centre too!
5
Tian Tian occupies two stalls in Maxwell market. There are two queues which you have to be aware. If you are going to order, go the the extreme right (near to the walk path) and queue up for your order to be taken. Once you have make payment, they will ask you to go to the left stall to collect your food. Avoid lunch time crowd. Remember to try their ginger which other Tian Tian branch do not serve. Personally, the chicken and rice is much nicer than Chatterbox Mandarin except there is no air-con here. Due to too many chicken rice stalls at this hawker centre, Tian Tian do not sell in the evening, suspect they close once all chicken sold out (maybe around 4pm).Due to construction around the carpark, you may feel stuffy sometime. Better wear light clothing if you visit there
4
I had not understood the obsession with chicken rice until I tried this one. We got to the hawker market expecting a queue and were not disappointed! Although the queue was quite long it moved quickly, and within about 20 minutes we were enjoying our food. The chicken is tender, rice is wonderfully flavoured and the sauces provided sublime - and inexpensive to boot
5
When you arrive the Maxwell Food Center, one must focus and go straight to Stall 11 Tian Tian Hainenese Chicken Rice. (As there are so many other stalls offering similar or different kinds of food, it is very easy to get distracted.) To avoid a long queue at Tian Tian, please go there a bit earlier than noon.Simply order a standard chicken rice which costs S$5. The chicken is the most juiciest and yummiest chicken I've ever tasted. And the rice is so fragrant and delicious. The food was so good that I even go back for a second time. This time I ordered 1/2 chicken for S$12 and a bowl of rice for $0.80. Actually I found that the standard chicken rice option a much better deal. If you order x2 standard chicken rice, you will find that you got more chicken than 1/2 chicken.This place opens early too. You can in fact go for breakfast rather than eating the standard western breakfast bacon and eggs in hotels which I found extremely boring
5
We got there about 10 am and completely beat the rush. After about 15 minutes the line had exploded to what must have been at least an hour wait. The rice is so good just by itself, with chicken and the sauces it's a flavour bomb. Went back the next day too.There are certainly cheaper options but the small extra cost is worth it.Get there early
4
This was a nice lunch chicken was nice and the sauce and rice was very tasty. Went nicely with a Calamansi Juice. We had a late lunch so not much of a line
5
try singapore famous and favourite food. hainanese chicken rice. nice and good but be prepared to wait and endure the heat in the eating place
3
No soup is provided even with a half-chicken order. Although the rice is delectable, chicken is so-so. I prefer Ah Tai's chicken rice, Tian Tian's competitor in the chicken rice war.
4
fun place, Hawkers market Maxwell Center. The line wasn't too long, go for lunch early. Food really yummy, especially the hot sauce.
5
I visited today on the recommendation of colleagues and was not disappointed. The food is excellent. I highly recommend it to anyone visiting who would like great food and a local experience!
5
Went for early lunch at 11:30 am and found basically no line. Aromatic, soft, it was as good as advertised and inexpensive as S$5. I found it better than Ah-Tai, although both are excellent.
3
It is near china town with easy accessibility. The long queue took me around 30 minutes to get to order & I looked back there was a longer queue, in the afternoon three o'clock. Its famous chicken rice was good enough because it is tender & juicy, and the flavor of the chicken was good as well as its sauce. Rice with chicken oil was well balanced. Cuttlefish with bean sprout was ok too but the cuttlefish was very little. In comparison with street vendor or food court food it has good enough flavor but hard to believe why we spend 30+ minutes in the queue for a try...在Chinatown旁，非常好找，就在佛牙寺正對面，我們花了30分鐘排隊，等輪到我們時，排隊長龍更長了，那時候，是下午三點！海南雞算是好吃，嫩又多汁而且醬料也搭，米飯和雞汁也是味道和質量都很平衡，魷魚佐豆芽味道還不錯，但是魷魚很少；跟Food court和路邊攤相比整體味道還是比較好的，但是很難想像排隊要半小時以上
4
The chicken is very smooth, the sauce is delicious. There are different dishes of chicken rice (Small, Medium, Large) for customers to choose. If you would like to try more chicken, you may order half chicken (S$12)or whole chicken (S$24), then one or two bowls of rice at S$0.8 each.
5
Get in line early,easy if you arrived at Changi Airport at 6-30am. Dump luggage at your hotel and start exploring Singapore on foot. If mistakenly your hotel is way across town then a quick trip on their excellent underground train will get you close by. If arriving around 11-30am then stand in line. If arriving after 12-30 pm stand in a long line and be patient. The wait is worth it, delicious juicy perfectly tender chicken, soup, rice, bean sprouts, chilli for under $15 AUS. Why go on the first day ?? Of course so you can fit in at least one more visit before you fly out
4
We had heard about this famous restaurant for a while and jumped at the opportunity to eat here this past weekend. We were not disappointed! We came around 11:30 am on a Saturday and we were glad we did as there was already a long line and hungry people waiting! It did not take long at all to get our food. We had the chicken breast on rice. The rice was very light and very delicious and could be very much eaten by itself. The breast was moist and tender and the sauce added on top really made it almost silky. The chilli was delicious to add and not too spicy but helped to elevate the food. Would we come back? Would we recommend it? For 4.50 Sing hell yes!! We are already talking about it
4
The Chicken rice is not super fatty, and the chili just perfectly sour and chili to cut through the soft chicken.
Must try at least once.
4
The rice was very fragrant, chicken tender ( we ordered thighs) and vegetables good too.
The only comment I would make is : it was not enough! But when it's good, it's never enough.
4
Finally got to try the famous chicken rice at Tian Tian, chicken was moist and rice has "chicken oil" in it which made it tastes even better , very yummy and reasonably priced (around S$5), highly recommended !
5
Excellent Chicken Noodles!! for a great price!! Every meal in Singapore is and excellent meal !!! mix it with all the sauces !!
4
If you're looking for tasty Hainanese chicken rice, look no further than Tian Tian. The chicken was moist and the sauce had good flavor. Reasonably priced (SG$5) and delicious, can't ask for more!

Chicken Rice is one of the Singapore dishes that every visitor to Singapore must try. And Tian Tian is up there amongst the very famous.At one time this place was voted number one by local foodies. Anthony Bourdain, an American celebrity chef, loves it. Personally I would say it is good but there are others equally good or better.Tian Tian was one of the stalls the government shipped lock, stock & barrel to one of those Singapore Day events in the USA. I was tucking into the chicken rice at Maxwell Food Centre and narrating this to my colleagues when two ladies sharing the table interrupted me: "Sorry, but we cannot help but overhear you. We want to clarify that this was arranged by the Prime Minister's Office, us!"The queue can be long and finding a free table difficult. But if you don't like the queue, you can check out Tian Tian's direct competitor, Ah Tai, 3 stalls away. Ah Tai was Tian Tian's cook for 20 years until he was fired. Apart from the chicken, I also like the liver and gizzard. Try them.
3
I have been to this stall in the past with a large group when we ordered a whole chicken. That was fantastic as the meat was tender, and the fat beneath the skin was crystalline in globules.This time I was alone but the experience was downgraded to common. The meat whilst still tender, was nothing to crow about. It was so underwhelming that the rice stood out with its aroma. And that common, unspecial plate cost me $5.Lesson learnt
4
Singaporeans take pride in their chicken rice, and while most (or everyone actually) will have their own take on which stalls are the best one in Singapore, Tian Tian in Maxwell Food Centre takes the Bib Gourmand for the great representation of the chicken rice in Singapore. In fact, Anthony Bourdain himself in his show praised this stall, and I suppose the reason why lines will form at this outlet.Come early and avoid the crowd
4
Chicken rice is pretty much the national dish of Singapore and Tian Tian are one of the finest exponents of this dish. It looks so simple, almost boring on the plate....however one taste quickly changes this perception as the flavoursome rice perfectly combines with amazing chicken. Add to this some chilli and you can create your own taste sensation. I'd prefer to add some soy as well....but unless we missed it, Tian Tian no longer offer this condiment....this was the main reason I can't give it 5 stars.We got to Tian Tian early.....around 10.30am on a Sunday and there was already a queue formed....it took about 20 minutes....so not too bad, and definitely worth the wait
3
So this hawker stall is really famous. Anthony Bourdain and Gordon Ramsay have been here and liked it. I would say along with boon tong kee (river valley and balestier) and wee nam kee (marina square), this is the trifectaAvoid peak meal times unless you like waiting for 30min in a line. I went at 2pm and it was fineFood's good and this is hawker food , and cheap. Some reviewers give this only 1 star and i wonder wh
5
We found that the chicken rice here is too good and moisture , and fresh material , recommend to have it
1
For me completely over rated. The chicken was served cold, best part was the chilli sauce on the side. Sought this place out on a busy trip and not really worth it to be honest. Food was fine and tasted good, but expected more
5
Stumbled across this place and saw the line so we thought it must be good. Very cheap and filling. Tasty chicken rice. Wouldn't highly recommend.
5
The chicken rice is smooth and fragrant. You can also chose the vegetables to go along in a set. Definitely much cheaper than Mandarin Hotel Chatter box and great taste too.
5
Very popular venue, long line up to 30 mins, good value great taste and very fresh. The chicken melts in your mouth
5
Some of the best chicken I've ever eaten in my life. The rice was beautifully seasoned,the chicken melted in my mouth and the sauce complimented it perfectly. My only regret was ordering the smallest portion. The queue is long I wait 15-20 minutes, tourists and locals in line
5
Okay, everyone can boil a chicken, but no one can do it like Tian Tian. Simply the best Chicken Rice I've ever tasted (and I have had too many). The chicken meat was perfectly cooked, succulent and super tender. Maybe the secret is they have soaked it in the gravy (just a guess). If you don't want the chicken skin, you can simply tell them when you order. The dish is accompanied by a sour ginger and garlic dipping sauce but no broth. It's quite cheap--only SGD 5 for a medium-sized Chicken Rice (regular size for most people). This place has lifted my standard and I don't think I can even be happy again with the local Chicken Rice stalls here in Thailand
5
My family loves chicken rice. Whenever we're in Singapore, that's probably all we eat. We've tried it in hawker stalls, high-end restaurants, and food courts. We sought out Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice after it got good reviews from Anthony Bourdain and Gordon Ramsay. We heard that lines could be long so we went early. We got there a little before the lunch hour, so the line was short. We ordered the chicken rice and beansprouts with cuttlefish. We were not disappointed! The chicken was tender, not rubbery. The rice was flavorful, not oily. The beansprouts were crisp and delicious. Serving size was generous too. Very satisfying meal that doesn't hurt the pocket
4
Been here before, thought it was very good food back then, still think so now. The queue was not long when we got there at 11:30 AM, 15 minutes wait. We ordered a half chicken, $12 not including the rice. The chicken was very tender to almost melting in your mouth. The rice is tasty and the chilli is flavoursome. For this quality, it is worth the wait. For people whose tastebuds are not accustomed to chicken rice, you probably cannot tell the difference between a good chicken and a great chicken rice. But if you want to try the best in Singapore, this is it. But it is by no means the best in the world, for I have had better in other countries.One thing, there is a problem with the half chicken I ordered, this chicken did not have any drumstick. I wondered how this chicken could have survived with one leg missing. Or can it be they had forgotten to put the drumstick on my plate. Then I realised they also sell drumsticks chicken rice at a premium .... I don't mind if they tell me, before I pay, that their idea of a half chicken doesn't include the drumstick. Then I won't feel cheated. No happy. Good food but I am not coming back
5
I am told this a highly rated place to eat. I was lucky by arriving early I caught a break in the queue for this food. I had the chicken rice and bean sprouts (see photo). It was delicious. Very simple and clean tasting. A very satisfying lunch.
4
Michelin rated Tian Tian Hainan chicken with plastic fork and spoon, such a cool moment in early afternoon. I wish y'all could taste it.
5
Went there for late lunch to avoid the long waiting queue. Still as good as it taste 4 years ago when i first tried. Will always return whenever i am in SG
5
Tian Tian is worth the queue ... $5 SGD for a medium size plate, it is very good value. Q to pay, then q to get served, keep your receipt handy, the server needs it to know what to give you :-)
5
To go here, you have to go to Chinatown area by MRT, walk to the Maxwell Hawker, you will notice a line of about 40 people to this hawker style restaurant. The wait was worth it. The chicken is juicy, tasty and plenty for a very good price, lower and better than food court price. Rice was so yummy too. For food lover, this is a must try in Singapore.Unlike other Michelin rated restaurant which is pricey, the price here is so cheap
4
Also highly recommended by my friends, I spent 15 minutes lining up during peak hours to order for their famous Hainan Chicken. Yes, as commented, they have moist, smooth chicken but I like their chicken oil rice more. The chicken meat texture has changed a bit when compared to the past (but it happened everywhere due to source of chicken). Basically, people lined up for eat at food court or take away
4
We came early not to miss out. Although it was raining & the hawker market wasn't busy this place had a longish line. 5 minutes to pay a very tiny $3.50 per meal. Then you wait with your ticket number to get your meal. The chicken was moist, tasty and the small serve was generous, & the chilli was really hot altho you add as much or little as you want. To get a drink you go next door for a beer, fresh coconut or selection of juices. All in all a great experienc
3
Within the last 3 months 1 had eaten at Tian Tian 3 times. First 2 times with my overseas University friends then the latest, 2 weeks back with family. Seems like each subsequent visit the standard drop. Service was minimal but at time the servers were impatient or particular in how one arranges the food on the tray to take to the table. The chicken was spongy to the bite unlike how normally you bite into the strands of chicken meat and has a layer of fat on the meat after removing the skin. Rice was soft and good tasting but not as aromatic as some unrated chicken rice stall across the street. My overseas friends did not finish the chicken on their second trip within a month after coming back for more as they had heard of Tian Tian's reputation saying it didn't taste as good as the previous trip. The beansprout vegetable dish was limp, overcooked. No consistency but at least its reasonably priced.If you are to visit the shop they do not open till 11:30am. Means you have to line up and wait whereby a queue forms, creating a very busy atmosphere. In the queue were mostly tourists and some with their guidebooks. To be fair I suggest one cross the street to Chinatown food center level 2 and compare the chicken rice stall located near the escalator
5
Having been told about this place by several friends who'd been we gave it a try. And we were not disappointed. Just the Q of locals lining up is a good sign you've got the right place. Tried both the steamed and grilled chicken. 25SGD for 2 half chickens. Highly recommended
3
My husband was intended to try almost every chicken rice stall in the city. This, along with Hong Kong, is one of the most popular ones in the city. I found it a complete bummer. It is very cheap, indeed, but it was a boiled soggy-chewy chicken with barely a bit of soya sauce. I still can't understand why there is so much fuss about chicken rice.Give it a try if you'd like to have street food experience and you don't want to queue for Hong Kong
4
Tried their Lavender outlet. Stall 5 in the air conditioned food court of Hotel Boss, Jalan Sultan. There is no queue at 11am. The nearest mrt is Lavender MRT. The chicken is very flavorful. Today's rice was not as fragrant as their Maxwell outlet. Their chilli is very spicy so be prudent for those who cannot take too spicy food. I prefer the rice and chilli of Five Star Hainanese chicken rice which have more layered flavors. But Tian Tian is located in a foodcourt and the prices are definitely more value for money than the other more famous chicken rice stalls which charge at restaurant prices. If you are ordering for 2-3 people, it is more worthwhile to order half a chicken ($14) as compared to individual plates of $5.80. Will visit again when the chicken rice crave kicks in ever so often. Enjoy 
5
Excellent chicken but the perfect grain of rice is the star here. Fast service and not too long a queqe when we were there.
4
Chicken is very tender but overall is a little bit too plain for me. Sauce was good. Its very cheap,come with 3size S M L.
4
Just follow the line and you'll end up here for very good tasty hainanese chicken rice. Inexpensive and hits the spot.
1
Went there last Sunday and regretted it. The Hainanese chicken was terrible, not cooked enough, with blood! Will never go back...
5
Have been at this place several times now and it never disappoints. Absolutely love the flavor and consistency of the chicken. The rice is perfect and one must add the broth and the sauces.It for sure is worth the wait and for the price one cannot go wrong
4
Got the information of this restaurant from travel book and decided to judge if her Hainanese Chicken Rice is better than I had before. with the price I paid, it is the highest C/P value in my experience. The chicken is very tender and the rice cooked just right. when mixed with the oily juice from chicken, it is so delicious. If you prefer the special part of chicken or want more pieces to share with your friends, you can ask owner to prepare for you
5
I had read a lot about Tian Tian and decided it would be my first point of call when I arrived from Perth because I love Hainanese Chicken Rice. The restaurant is located in a bustling food complex with about 100 different food stalls. Lots of choice. And very cheap. I ordered the Hainanese Chicken Rice for two S$13.50. The Chicken and sauce was the best I have had. The Chicken Rice even better. In fact, I have never tasted Rice with so much flavour. This meal was definitely worth coming 4000km for. I'll go back tomorrow and try some of the other stalls
5
The good thing about this chicken rice is they have already taken out all the bones in the chicken so you just enjoy the chicken meat. Some restaurant they still have the bones in the chicken rice. The chicken meat also taste tender. It cost S$5 and S$4 for the bok choy veggies. I love this chicken rice so I recommend this chicken rice
4
What to say.... great chicken rice.As good as boon tong Kee chicken rice... but at much better prices. I do hope I've not offended and die hard fans by making this cross reference...Located at the market which is clean and airy. With other good food available within the same centre.... it's great.Do give it a try. happy eatin
4
located in a not so attractive place, if you are a tourist so happen to be at Chinatown area, give this a try. only go for the white steamed chicken. as that is their signature dish. rich flavour on the rice would test your palate. Awesome local dish
5
This place has its reviews and accolades in large print on the outside of the stand so you can't miss it. Their chicken did not disappoint and the price is unbeatable. There was a line but it moved very quickly.
5
It's so tasty with a reasonable price. The chicken itself is a bit thick but soft and juicy inside. Anyway the best is the soy sauce poured over the chicken which keep a secret of their authentic recipe...."My best chicken rice in Singapore."
5
I go here everytime I visit Singapore and it never disappoints me. This time I brought along my whole family and they all loved the Chicken Rice especially the fragrant rice.
3
Visited their outlet at Jalan Pari Burong near bedok. Ordered both the roasted chicken and white chicken. They have this standard chicken gravy in light brown colour poured onto the chicken as well as their bean sprout. Find the taste of this gravy too salty. Rice is okay. MSG is on high side for this place. We tried the hainanese pork cutlet, it's crispy on the outside but pork is slightly too dry and hard; not well marinated too. This is not the place I'll think of if I've craving for chicken rice

We've now eaten here twice and have not been disappointed! The rice is fantastic and very tasty - surpasses all other hawker stalls. The chicken is well cooked and also very tasty with that great sauce! Would recommend to all who visit the Maxwell Food Centre

Searched from website about Maxwell food centre. They recommend to eat chicken rice. The first time I visited at night, all foods were sold out. Next day, I went in morning before 11:30 to avoid long queue. The staffs were nice to introduce their food. I ordered small dishes $4 chicken and one bean sprouts. It was at average not as said very nice. Chicken texture was not soft, may be too thin less fat. But can try once you visit there

Big queue suggested it was going to be great. Was ok fresh and tasty but two doors down is the original chef form this kitchen who is offering a way better chicken rice and gives you soup and other things for cheaper than the over rated place
5
We stumbled across this vendor completely by accident and were simply overwhelmed at the amazing flavours and cheap prices. This was without doubt, the best chicken rice we tasted while in Singapore, the owner's reputation is well deserved. I didn't find out about her story until after we had left the market or I would have tipped more - she hasn't raised the prices in years. Considering the amount of money other food vendors charge for sub-par quality food, this lady deserves every dollar you have spare. Would highly recommend that you make time to visit this vendor
4
Stopped in here whilst we were around Chinatown.Located indoors and very warm if you aren't sitting near a fan.Quite a cheap meal being about S$4 for the chicken and a serving of rice.Good flavors for both the chicken and the rice but I wouldn't go out of my way just for this dish
5
We came to Singapore 3 years ago and went here after reading all the media/celebrity chef hype.I stood in the queue in the heat for nearly an hour.We had never had Hianese Chicken before. Seriously how good could it really be?I remember getting back to the plastic table with a plasric tray of assorted plastic plates and bowls. After an hour in the queue in Singapore November heat and humidity, I was a bit 'over it' before I started.We had no idea how we were supposed to eat it - so we mixed a bit of the chicken with a bit of rice, some of the thick black sauce (we assumed was dark soy) and a bit of the chilli-looking sauce. Into the mouth on a plastic spoon and .... BOOM !! I still remember looking at my wife as we savoured the taste and had that "OMG how good is this?" look on our faces.Three years later and it's on the top of our "must do" list in Singapore. Nothing could stop us. The lesson learnt from our last visit was NOT to go right at lunch time. We turned up at about 3.30pm on a Sat afternoon, queued for about 5 mins and HELLO - the chicken was even more moist than I remembered, but the same memorable flavours.It about S$10 for a plate of chicken, cup of rice, bowl of broth, plate of baby bok choy and saucer of chilli & saucer of soy sauce.Unless you have great Hianese Chicken at home or you live in Singapore (where there may well be better examples) - if you do nothing else in Singapore - do your mouth a favour and visit here once. I don't care if it's the best or the cheapest as I have nothing to compare it too. I just know it tastes great and I leave happy. And with so much other great tasty and cheap food available here in Singapore, that's a big call.We will look forward to coming here yet again when we next visit Singapore. Still top of the list
4
Went here as Tian Tian was very famous and a lot people said must eat whenever you came Singapore. So we are here. Queue for 30mins, overall the chicken is nice. Can try when you are here.
4
Many tourist's heading here for taste a very yummy chicken rice. Personally, I think it just OK or you need to order some other part like wing, breast with oily skin.
4
it's a best chicken rice i had in Singapore, the chicken was so tender and juicy, the rice was sweet and smelly. You should try it.
5
This is one of the great chicken rice I've had so far. Chicken is very tender. Portions provided is quite good for a $3.50 plate. Rice alone is quite delicious... service is very fast and efficient and the stall is clean.Overall very delicious. Excellent value for $$.Highly recommended... happy eating
5
I came here on a weekday just before 7pm and was prepared to queue like you have to do so for many popular street food stalls, so I was delightfully surprised I did not have to queue at all! I must have come at a good time since 10 minutes after I sat down with my food a queue did start to form (guess I was lucky in my timing!). I ordered a plate of chicken rice with gizzards and stir fried beansprouts with cuttlefish (plus a whole chicken to take home with me because why the hell not). The beansprouts were nice and crunchy and the cuttlefish had a good snappy texture. The gizzards had just the right level of chewiness and the pieces of chicken were juicy and succulent. The star of the dish for me was definitely the rice, which was incredibly flavourful with the taste of chicken stock and was very delicious with the chilli sauce followed by the cooling crunch of the cucumber slices.If you don't mention anything to the cashier, the default chicken rice serving is the medium size (around 5S$), so if you just want a light bite tell them you want the small serving and if you are feeling extra hungry then by all means let them know you want the large serving! It's definitely worth a visit here to try what is probably one of Singapore's best chicken rice dishes! :
5
On a few hours lay-over in Singapore, besides all the recommendations on all travel info re Singapore, our taxi driver insisted we get our Chicken Rice from Tian Tian in Maxwell Food Centre, and he summarily took us there. And my oh my, we were so glad he did! Having eaten this dish countless times before, some restaurant prepared, some home-cooked (by Singaporeans), I was simply amazed at how good their Hainanese Chicken Rice was. A taste that's still lingering until now
5
Queued for about half an hour for Tian Tian, ordered the small sized chicken rice and a vegetable- was plenty of food for lunch. Although more expensive than the average chicken rice, it was definitely the best I've had. The other reviews are accurate, the rice is definitely what makes the dish great
3
Tian Tian is very much in the news because of certain celebrity chefs. There is always a long queue but locals like myself know that there are many other great Hainanese chicken rice around. However if you are a tourist or happen to be around the area, this is a good choice to have a meal of good Hainanese chicken rice
3
Since Chan's HK Soya Sauce Chicken wasn't open, we opted to come here. It was 3pm and there was no queue.Tian Tian is a disappointing "average".Service is fast but indifferent and impatient. Although they have plenty of drumsticks on display, the woman hawking over the cash register say "no drumstick".. okayyyy...strike 1..The chicken is soft, and rather tasteless. Mostly, the flavor comes from the saltish sauce they pour over the chicken.. strike 2The rice is ok, not outstanding or particularly memorable. The chili sauce is too piquant and drowns out all the other flavors... strike 3Forget about the Michelin/Bourdain hype.. It was probably good once and it found fame. Certainly not outstanding now, just plain average..
4
My friends had recommended to go to Tian Tian if I wanted to have the best Chicken Rice in Singapore. Tian Tian is located in Maxwell Hawkers place. It is a popular place both for locals and tourists and hence the waiting was expected. I had to wait for around 15 minutes in the line before my turn came for the Chicken Rice. I must say the rice was extremely flavourful and was delicious . The Chicken did not have any flavours and was cold. I am not sure if that's how it's meant to be.If you are in Singapore and want to try Chicken Rice,you must go to Tian Tian
5
There are plenty of chicken rice in Singapore, but this one is delicious, despite the long queue. The fragrance of the rice is unique.
3
Was ok but nothing special. Found Boon Tong Kee much better. Went to the MacPherson outlet. Was very delicate, subtle, melts like butter in your mouth.
4
We were walking around Singapore and came across the maxwell food center. The long queue made me curious so we are here. It was tasty. Afterwards I checked this place but can't really understand the hype of it.
4
Yes, the chicken was good- tender and soft, and if you come there at the lunch time, you have to queue because this spot is pretty famous and popular. However, you may get as lovely chicken as this one in other places in Singapore too (e.g. Chinatown Market Hawker Complex) and it could be cheaper for a bigger portion. This place is popular because of its commercial history and tourists are probably happy to be there
4
So I brought my parents here for them to decide whether the chicken rice is worth all the type. I have been burnt before by going to restaurants favored by Bourdain and I still haven't figured out Ramsay's tastebuds. Got there at 1105 on a weekday and there was no wait. The rice definitely is top notch and not too oily, the chicken is tender, and it is definitely not frozen, but the texture to me suggests recently slaughtered and refrigerated rather than freshly slaughtered free range chicken. The chili sauce is spicy hot. My parents liked it enough, but there are better ones out there according to them. So the hunt continues....
4
Sure, this place doesn't need my review, it's well patronised by many a traveler and local alike, and Anthony Bourdain's picture is displayed proudly out front, but it should be visited if you are new to Singapore or new to Hainanese chicken. It's fresh succulent soft chicken atop a fragrant and delicious chicken rice on a no nonsense plastic plate that you may need to line up for. Sure, you may not understand the 'hype' but let's be honest, it's chicken rice, and it's good, there's no 'hype' to understand. While at the same food centre, try a Maxwell Fuzhou oyster cake a couple of doors down, be careful, they are piping hot. The Ondeh-Ondeh tapioca cake should also be tasted because it's soft fluffy texture and coconut shaving makes you realise we've been doing shredded coconut wrong in the western world. Just avoid lunch time, and you'll avoid the long queues
5
The chicken was succulent and tender, beautifully comlemented by the flavoursome rice and the piquante garlic and ginger sauce. Chicken Rice is an institution in Ssingapore and Tian Tian has nothing left to prove. Hainanese Chicken rice is a subtle balance of flavours and textures unlike any other chicken dish you are likely to try. Dont compare it to european styles of cooking, but enjoy it for what it is. Recommended for travellers looking for a first class example of local cuisine
5
best hainanese chicken rice located at maxwell food center, always crowded by locals and tourist, when you decide to try it then be prepared to queue. i ordered chicken rice and vegetable with oyster sauce, both chicken dan vegetable cooked perfectly when i bite it so soft and tasty. the price comparable to what you get, 5 dollar for chicken rice and 4 for vegetable. someday i'll come back here when i visited singapor
5
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice is already a game player in the Singapore hawker food scene even before they beat Gordon Ramsey on a Hainanese Chicken Rice cookout a few years back.Others might find it touristy, because most who are queueing are tourists, but I'd say, more than the novelty, their Hainanese Chicken Rice is truly something to rave about. The taste and the texture is truly something that you can say is truly worth trying (and queueing) for. The rice is firm yet soft to the bite at the same time and packed with flavors that are not too overwhelming.The queueing system is very systematic, making the queue fast moving. Also, even if the stall is quite popular, I find that it is a value for money still.Nearest MRT Stations are Chinatown MRT (North-East Purple Line) or Tanjong Pagar MRT (East-West Green Line). It seems to be equidistant from both MRT Stations(which is quite a walk) but at least once you've tried their chicken rice, you can boast that you've already ate at the stall that beats Gordon Ramsey on a cookout
5
We went to Tian Tian at Maxwell food center because we saw many reviews about it. And yes, we were happy that we did! We got there in the late afternoon around 3.30pm-ish so there were not many people waiting. We ordered 2 chicken rice and one half chicken as well. The chicken was moist and soft, with the faint aroma of ginger. The rice was also not too oily or too hard. The sauce was my favorite---spicy! but not too strong so it didn't overpower the chicken. We were both pretty impressed
2
I was really looking forward to trying their famous chicken rice. Sadly, I was disappointed big time. The chicken was bland. There's no taste. I don't know why it get so much hype. Most of their customers are tourist.
5
yummy chicken rice!! but i have to queue about 10 or more minutes. but it's still ok. The chicken and sauce are delicious!
5
We stopped by at early dinner time line was only 5 people long so jumped in and lined up. The wife and I enjoyed the $5 chicken and rice and we tried a few during our recent trip and it was probably the best. Must say I think it has become more popular as a tourist spot to get your photo taken than for for having good food
2
It was my favourite but not anymore, the chief changed and the management changed and not too friendly. I ordered a chicken rice without telling the size, they didn't ask me and took my $5 note without changing, then I realised they have size difference, so I told them I want the small one which is $3.5, the boss refused and told me $5 one is not too big and most people wanted. When I received the chicken rice, they didn't give me the soup until I requested. And the "medium" size rice is no different with other chicken store. All chicken rice supposed to come with the soup and costs around 3.5, due to their popularity they are a bit not honest enough for me. It's not about money but the service. That's how I scored low. However the taste is alright
5
When we came to Maxwell, there was a line queuing in front of this chicken rice stall. After waiting for about 20 minutes, we finally ordered our food. We chose Hainanese chicken rice for two. The rice was very nice while chicken was cooked perfectly: tender and juicy. The accompanied sauce was excellent that made us wanted to eat more and more. It was worth to visit Maxwell and have lunch with chicken rice there. Very delicious indeed
5
This stand is probably the closest you will get to perfectly cooked chicken rice in Singapore. We always have a plate of this at least once in our holidays when we are in the city, so do go there and try it out. Just be aware that they do close early in the evening, best time to go is for lunch or late afternoon
5
Should you choose to go there during lunch or dinner time, be prepared to queue up for over an hour. It received rave reviews from celebrity chef such as Bourdain, and this stall never looked back. Relatively, chicken rice here is pricey where chicken rice itself is sold separately from chicken (be it chicken drumstick, half or whole). Not all chicken rice is made the same. The difference is subtle such as the glistening aspect of its skin, the flavour of the rice and so forth. Suffice to say that the chicken rice here is not about the quantity that it's offering but the flavour itself, which is balanced and just right. This stall is located at Maxwell Food Centre, which is one of the fews that are allotted for the tourists. Therefore, you shouldn't have any difficulty in locating this place. Highly recommended. Only for the die hard chicken rice fan
2
To locals, this chicken rice certainly isn't worth the queue. The rice is rather dry and they add oyster sauce like sauce on the chicken. Chicken meat isn't exactly tender. There are better chicken rice where even the breast meat is tender. There are loads of chicken rice in Singapore and many are actually better.The Maxwell hawker centre can be rather hot and crowded during meal times, especially lunch on a working day. Be there early to be able to get a seat and beat the long queue
5
Tian Tian was in Maxwellfoodcentre, lots of people line up for it. The chicken rice was delicious, especially the chicken! I really loved the chicken. If you come here at lunch time, you have to wait for ages. You should get here before 11.00 AM to avoid the crowd. Must try their chicken rice, great taste
4
Since 2001, each year, I visit Singapore and all time something new amazing me. With my partner, this time, we had a very nice lunch in court food centre in Maxwell. An amazing thing to see so many people waiting their moment to get chicken and rice served in simply way. The different? How to boil the chicken using at the end cold water. In a few word, you cannot sad to have visit Singapore without take pleasure in eating this fantastic chicken and rise
1
This is just bland chicken with some slightly flavoured rice. So disappointing. With all the fantastic food in Singapore, try something else in the same or other hawker centre.
4
love any traditional cuisine. After coming a long way to Singapore, the first thing i want was to try this Hainanese Chicken rice in Maxwell center near the place i stayed. Ordered a standard set, the rice was really terrific, full of yellow oil. i could just eat such kind of rice without any dishes. The chicken itself, well, was just ok, but not really impressive
2
There is queue but it moves smoothly. The famed eatery occupied two stalls: one for cashier (back office) and one for dishing out food (front office). Very efficient, the premise looks more like a factory churning out widgets than a hawker stall cooking up food. And the taste of the chicken shows: it is rather bland, it is a bit chewy and it is not cheap by hawker food standard. No wonder most of the people queue are tourists with big cameras hanging around their neck ..
4
As Hainanese chicken rice are fond of around the world, it's a pleasant to have a chance to savour the original one in China Town, Singapore. The waiting line is not that bad, it takes me only 15-20 minutes to get an order. Hainanese people are very well-known as the best food makers, the original chicken rice here is not disappointed. It's just a lot more oily on both chicken & rice than our Thai style though. Another big difference from Thai's descendant is that the chicken here is served cold
4
It's definitely worth the trip. I personally don't like the rice, nothing wrong with it, but find it a bit dry. I ordered 1/2 chicken and small serve of the rice. One of the best meal I had during my visit. Despite the long queue, serving was relatively quick and organised
4
The rice is very good, better than the chicken. Can't say if it is better than others shops because this is the only Hainanese chicken rice I had. In terms of chicken dishes in general this one is good. The plate I had only cost $5, really can't complain
3
They're famous for their Hainanese chicken rice (chef and tv personality Anthony Bourdain has been one of the visitors), but I think it's so so.The food is good, but I might have had high expectations when I visited it last year.As it's popular and mentioned in a lot of guides, expect long queues
5
OMG I am so jealous of the lucky people of Singapore to have such a fantastic dish let alone a fantastic restaurant/stall that can make it so perfectly. I wish I could eat this dish at least twice a week. When we arrived at Maxwell Food Court looking for the stall all we saw was the queue to buy the dish, it was long but in less than 10 minutes we were sitting down to an absolute delicious meal. Obviously the locals know which one to go to as there are two stalls but only one had the queue of about 20-30 people at any given time. The chicken was so moist and succulent and the rice was so flavoursome, you might want to watch out for the chilli paste-itâ€™s bloody hot and I like hot food. Oh man this was so, so good. It was a perfect meal for a perfect day
3
Even in the morning, there is a long queue to get a plate of chicken rice. It's a bit expensive if you want to have the thigh. You order your food, pay and get your plate from the adjacent stall with your ticket. Chicken is tender, rice is well cooked, overall it's not bad but not to the extend that you will give a wow after the first bite.
5
As a local, I used to wonder what is the hype about this Chicken Rice stall. Today I finally tasted it and I have only one word to describe my experience ... AWESOME! The rice is fragrant and even on its own, it is simply delicious! The chicken is really tender and the chicken liver is really well cooked. The chilli and dark soy sauce just makes this experience of eating this chicken rice really heavenly! As the saying or belief goes, if the food is well liked by the locals, then it is truly authentic. I'm a typical local Singaporean and I highly recommend anyone who comes to Maxwell to try out this simple and yet so comfortingly delicious delicacy!
3
Decent chicken rice. Nothing exceptionally good about it. Guess the long lines are formed by tourists giving it a try.
5
tian tian hainanese chicken rice located in maxwell food court , maxwell rd. china town area. the rice and chicken is soft. it's tasty.
2
Came because my mate Anthony bordain told that world it's a great experience. This was basically bland chicken over a plate of very oily rice. I think there are more flavourful plates of chicken in Singapore. Chicken rice experience was lacking here.
5
Exceptional! Long q, but worth every second. So shiok ah... come here earlier if dinner and close on Mondays.
5
Easy to find as its the only place in the market with a long queue.
This guy has perfected this simple dish, I doubt you will anything so tasty yet so cheap.
4
This was our first stop, recommended by cab drivers and local expats alike. The line stretches all the way out the building but moves quickly. The restaurant is a hawker stall whose claim to fame is chicken rice - essentially boiled chicken and then served with rice cooked in the broth. It's tasty, served with some fresh juices and carrot cake (not a cake at all)
4
Visited here as a meal attraction every time we come to Singapore. The taste of chicken is very good, soft and tender, juicy, sumptuous , thin skin without fat layer underneath, therefore , not fatty as other chicken rice elsewhere . Ordered half chicken(S$12) with 2rice(S$0.7 each) , this was value meal for our visit. Open from early afternoon and out of stock around 1730pm varied to how many customers that day. Queuing about 20-30 min, varied too.but worth waiting.Seem that there's other 2 branches in other location in Singapore, but we visited only here at Maxwell food center after visited Bhuddha Tooth Relics Temple just across the road.Still being our meal destination in Singapore as the price is reasonable for staying in Singapore
4
We went there for breakfast and made our choice based on the recommendation that you should go for the stalls with the long lines. Thus we ended up with this one, something we do not regret. Absolutely great and tender chicken and I can understand what all the fuss is about. Try it.
3
Yes, this is one of the nicer chicken rice here but definitely not the best. It's definitely much over-rated. And staff are not friendly as well. Have tried other chicken rice stalls in other food centres & some are way better & much cheaper too.There is one very good & very popular steam chicken rice stall at nearby Chinatown Complex 2nd floor Food Centre ( it's 5 mins walk away from here). Stall name is Super Mummy Hainanese Chicken Rice ( closed on Thursday).In our opinion, this stall's chicken rice taste better & is cheaper too. And the owner & assistant are nice & polite too.'Famous' doesn't always mean the best but often, it is more expensive. And dot of wasted time queuing
3
I lived in Singapore for almost a year, and I thought at some point I should go visit this place, as everyone talked about it. It was very average. Not my favourite chicken rice and the queue was annoyingly large. If youre around, pop by, but if not, don't bother going
5
Yum. This place is my go to spot for chicken and rice when in Singapore. The line is long for a reason but sucks too because it's so hot and humid and those fans aren't much help.
5
Tian tian's chicken rice is everything!! Delicious rice topped with perfectly boiled chicken and the sauce... Wow!! Ended up eating there 3 times just because it was so good!!
2
There are way better chicken rice dishes in Singapore. This is same or worse than the standard that you find in other hawker/food Centres. Furthermore, service is subpar. I ordered two portions, but they just REFUSED to give me more than one little dish of sauce. Man in line behind me was told to pay for soy sauce too. This is simply unheard of in Singapore, or most other places in the world, really..
2
They have been hailed as the best chicken rice in SG. It tastes good, the rice is better but the chicken is the same. It can be compared with Boon Tong Kee which is a popular sit down resto in SG. Staff were unpolite and maybe they have a thinking that theres a lot more customers waiting than me so they do not give importance. I just asked for ginger and sweet soy sauce on the side and they said this is not possible. They just squirted the kecap manis on the side of the plate and asked me to go away! Hey guys its not all about the food! Its the experience
5
This is really good stuff. Worth the 10 minutes I had to wait in line to get the food. The chicken was amazingly soft & flavorful and the rice was superb. The chilli sauce is definitely not to be missed. 5 Stars doll for the food
2
Taste is okay, but the texture of chicken is poor. Quite obvious they use and don't know how to deal with chilled chicken. Even the chicken leg is not soft and tender. Lined up for half an hour under the hot weather and had a famous but low quality Hainanese Chicken Rice, didn't worth it. Tried one at Lau Pa Sat and it was much better
5
Having a chance to visit this place during the Indie Chinatown Tour, this magical food stall shocked me with their delicious plate of chicken rice. I ordered the medium size which cost me S$5, quite cheap for a meal in Singapore. The chicken is so moist and tender while the rice is cook with the chicken stock to make it more flavourful. If you want to try Hainanese Chicken Rice in Singapore, this place is a must!! You may have to queue for your plate of chicken rice during lunch time due to their popularity so be patient because it worths the wait
5
This place really does live up to the hype! We had chicken rice a number of times while in Singapore and this was hands down the best. We were lucky to go during a quiet time but I hear the lines can get long if you go during main meal times. Worth the wait!
4
As usual the queue is long but this Sunday twice as long. I read some reviews on their Facebook that the food was bad. So having been coming for so many years and the last time more than 2 years, I've decide to see if things had changed. Well the food I thought is still the same, hot fragrances rice and tasty succulent meat and the awesome chill with ginger and black sauce are still all there. We also ordered from the 4 other stalls around them to see how the competition is faring. I have to say that the queue is still right. They are still the better one, abit the much more famous stall.
1
The chicken rice is nice - an institutional comfort food in Singapore, but not significantly better to other vendors across the island.The staff was extremely impolite rude and disrespectful. I asked for a tiny bit of coriander leave on my chicken rice, I was blasted with a fierce 'no' and was educated that the precious little green leaves is only available to customer ordering half chicken or more. The poor HK tourist in front of me, ordered half chicken for her family to share, only to get scolded in public that she was not allowed to take more than 2 sets of cutlery. And we all got told off by queueing at the wrong space with no sign or instruction visible. There may be some authentic street food on the planet which are worth being treated rudely and humiliated for the sake of the heavenly good taste. This is definitely not those class yet. I do not like to be treated in this manner particularly during my holiday. I would not come back again, could not be bothered.
5
Here is the place to go. Maxwell Food Centre (Hawkeer Center). The longest lines in this Hawker Center--that tells you that this place is great!!! Tasty chicken and rice dish. Cheap and excellent!!
5
Very delicious and inexpensive! The only down side is that the food center is very crowded and hot and the queue for Tian Tian can be very long!
4
This is a good restaurant here.The chicken rice is good.The service is good. The price similar to other ones around here.
4
This is my top of the list restaurant in singapore, u can't miss this when u visit singapore. They usually sell out around evening, so better to go there for lunch
4
Love a simple dish of hainanese chicken rice. A subtle hint of ginger. Perfectly cooked chicken breast and rice. Simple and tasty.
4
Always wondered why always such long queues at this food outlet in Maxwell's so on last visit to the Singapore went early (11:30 am) one day to give it a try. Only about 4 people in line then, although 15 minutes later there were about 15 queuing! Had the basic offering as not very hungry. It was good and excellent value at S$3.50. Think I will go back with others for a brunch and go for the full or half steamed chicken and the vegetable dishes. Though very good (many say it is the best Hainanese chicken rice in Singapore) I still don't quite understand the long queues for it (often 20+ long at busy times). Compares favourably with the Wenchang chicken they rave about in Hainan. Definitely worth a visit but pick you time unless you like queuing
3
Be prepared to line up when you decide to eat chicken rice here. I think we were lucky to only reach Maxwell after the lunch crowd and the line was considerably short (about 20mins).I thought the chicken rice was good...but I've had better. Being a frequent visitor to Singapore, it's worth a try, but I wouldn't bother to line-up if I see a crazy long line next time.Over, I just wasn't keen on the 'un-smiley' faces at the stall compared to every other place in Singapore, they are known to be friendly
5
I managed to tried four different places for the iconic Singaporean Chicken Rice (hotel on Santosa, Chin Chin, Harbor View food court). This is by far the best. The line is long but move pretty fast. There are three portions 3.75, 4, 5 SD. You should try this place
3
This used to be amazing chicken rice, full of flavour with amazing sauce but a recent visit has showed that they are now no longer the iconic chicken rice of Singapore.No longer do you get your broth with a standard order, the sauce now seems to have been thickened with corn flour and has very little flavour. There is no condiments available apart from the chilli vinegar which is run of the mill.The chicken itself was okay but nothing special. The rice however was tasty, fragrant and was the redeeming factor of the whole experience
5
Like many, I heard about this through the Gordon Ramsey street food challenge. It certainly meet expectations. I have never had chicken so tender and tasty in my life. Do try and visit outside of peak hours and be warned, they often run out. We had to visit 3 times before they had stock and the queue was reasonable. But it was well worth it!
5
Simply the best. Really like their chicken rice and to me local the best in town. Super long q for the food but definitely worth the wait
4
If you stay near chinatown then you must try this tian tian hainanese chicken rice. The rice is fragance and chicken is moist and tender.
5
Walked very long to this place to have chicken rice. I went here twice and enjoy the food every time. Highly recommend!
5
It's very simple food, menu is limited. Typical family place focusing on only one thing. In this case it is chicken and rice. Personally, loved it.
5
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice is a stall that i have patronized since i started my chicken rice craze and needless to say, the dish cannot be described by normal words...The rice is so smooth and the grain can be seen separately, the chili is not too spicy yet addictive and the chicken is so tender that you can differentiate between thigh and drumstick. DIE DIE must TRY
3
After heard about this place for years from overseas friends (none of my local Singaporeans ever recommend this place to me). Yesterday I was in the area and decided to check it out. I ordered half chicken and one pack of rice for take away. The Q was huge when I arrived at 1 p.m. But for take away service they just give it at the cashier spot which much better than eat it there and wait for 20 peoples ahead. The chicken was full of bone. It was tender but lack of flavor. The Rice quality was at standard hawkers. It wasn't much aroma in it. This place is far off from best chicken rice in Singapore which Loy Kee, Wee Nam Kee and Boon tong Kee. Those 3 were much better quality.

I’d heard of the popularity of Tian Tian and seen the lines many times before. Had visitors in town and we happened to be in the area so they requested that we give it a try. Saturday at lunch. Long line as usual but we somehow got through it. $28 for a plate of chicken, three servings of rice and a small order of baby bok choy with oyster sauce. I eat an awful lot of chicken rice. I found the Tian Tian chicken to be too tender, almost mushy, like it had been pressure cooked or sous-vide. Flavor was also on the disappointing side - not nearly as robust as you’d find at one of the other well-known chicken rice places (all of which seem to end in “Kee”). Rice was somewhat flavorful, but a tad mushy. Chili sauce was adequate. Overall, it is unlikely that I’d eat at Tian Tian again. I found it to be no better than the average chicken rice that you can find in almost every hawker center, coffee shop and food court on the island

Why they keep calling it Hainanese CR is beyond me. Singapore's version is far superior to the original Wanchang version. The dish served at Tian Tian is without doubt the best so far. I love the smooth, moist chicken and the fragrant rice that comes with it. I try to have it at least once each trip. Worth traveling for. And what a deal
3
I wonder what s the hype about.I am indonesian so we have pretty much other hainan chicken rice to compare with.This one is really mediocre.Had a better one in Kuala Lumpur airport.No need to have a specific trip here and queue.But if youre in the neighborhood, why not :
5
This place is definitely worth a visit when you're in Singapore. Pros: Good value overall. Chicken was nice and tender served with moist fragrant chicken rice. Recommend getting a whole chicken for 2-3 people. Cons: Huge lines followed by the difficulty to get a table. Be prepared for a long wait to get lunch.
5
On recommendations from TripAdvisor, hotel staff, taxi drivers - we made this our first stop upon arrival. The chicken was cooked perfectly tender and the rice was plentiful. Loved the cucumbers and hot sauce also! Best way to enjoy Singaporean specialty.
5
Went to Maxwell food center and found this stool with a line. Tryed and found that the linev(realy only 5 min. Wait) worth it - one of the best I had. Recommended!!
4
Got the small serving and I should've had the set meal with soup. Don't like fatty chicken but that's how the locals have it.
Good food and popular with the locals. Prepare to line up in busy lunch period.
4
This is very good place for Chinese Chicken and Rice.Its very tasty.Tge service is good and fast.The price is similar to other ones.
4
My friend & I ordered half chicken (S$ 12) and 2 rices (S$0.70), the meal is so cheap and taste is unforgettable. The chicken has it own taste. Also, if you like spicy, their sauce will be the STAR!!!
2
What's the hype about? The chicken was bland and it's plain white rice. It was decently tender but no seasoning I could taste. We put the red sauce all over it but still nothing to stand in a 30 minute line for. Clean and efficient though.
4
Inside Maxwell Food Centre near Tanjung Pagar . Very popular with tourists hence long queue at peak hours We waited for 20 minutes Oily Rice is very fragrant with emphasis on garlic . White chicken is soft and tender. Chillie sauce is on sourly side but good . Thick black sweet sauce . Need to ask fur ginger sauce Price is very reasonable . $4.50 for a drumstick and rice
5
Sometimes during off-peak hours, this is the only food stall at Maxwell's that has a permanent queue. The rave is justified, as the chicken rice is great. It is true that you can get something as good as or even better elsewhere, but if you are staying in Chinatown or will be around for sightseeing, this is sure to satisfy your chicken rice craving
5
I love chicken rice, and TT makes great chicken with lovely fragrant savoury rice. The chicken is moist juicy and tender, an excellent example of one of my favourite dishes. The only downside is that everyone else wants to eat it too so be ready to wait a while in peak time
5
This place serves amazing hainanese chicken! The queue can get very very long, but moves fairly quickly and the wait is totally worth it. We ordered the whole chicken with rice and it the portion enough for 2 people. The chicken was delicious and the flavour was so good! It's very soft and tender and it just melts in your mouth. The best hainanese chicken I've tasted. The meal was relatively cheap and definitely a good value. Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken is definitely a must try if you are in the area. It will not disappoint
4
The chicken dish is world famous due to the visit by Gordon Ramsay and the chicken dish is a little more expensive than the other stores, but well worth it, delicious.
4
Solid chicken rice at Maxwell Food Centre in Chinatown!!
I loved the simplicity and the way it does indeed fill you up!!
5
Chicken lovers let's go! I can come back here anytime, no second thoughts. I have tried many and this is so far the best there is. Each bite is juicy and tasty, not a single morsel of dryness. For those who have reviewed otherwise, possibly the chicken was more than 45 days old when their meal was served...haha!
3
It's definitely a lot of hype around the Chicken Rice thanks to Anthony Bourdain. I went there in the morning and was told they wouldn't be ready until around 10am. Before that, there are some (mostly tourists) who started to arrive. Once they opened, a line started to form but after you order you'll get your order within a few minutes. It was then time to taste what the hype was about. The chicken rice will cost around 3-7SGD depending on what size you get, though there are other dishes they do have. It wasn't the best tasting dish of anything chicken I've had. However, the sauce provided helps made it much more interesting and it was tender. Was it the greatest food experience? Not really, more of good not great. I would come back, but I would also look into trying the chicken rice from other vendors
5
Tian tian located in maxwell hawker, near budha temple and close from maxwell bus stop. You have to come early because this stand have a long quee. We come at 10am and have to wait in quee about 30 minutes. Tian tian was very famoust hainan chicken rice in singapore, they win again chef gordon ramsy and become singapore hero. Ordering whole chicken and four steam rice and also saite vegetable for four persons. The chicken was delicious, it's tasty and juicy soo good.
4
I had read that a neighbouring food stall would provide about as good chicken rice, but when we came (7.30 p.m.), they were closing, and ten people were queuing to this "famous one". So, we waited for 20 minutes and got our chicken&rice. It was good, perhaps very good, and if I would live in a hotel in Chinatown I might come again. But I would not walk one mile anymore
3
Few Singaporeans would venture here knowing its a tourist set up hyped by tourists(woefully) whom have not more than 5 chicken rice in their lifetime and think this is the greatest food since sluiced bread.If you have not been to chicken rice places anywhere n everywhere in Singapore please qualify your comments to avoid misleading others. I have taken a number of Hainanese people here esp. from Malaysia and heartland Singapore and ordered chicken from nearby stalls and their response was others was better coz the chicken was firm and not as placid/soft like the ones they served at Tian Tian.Not saying the chicken here is best in town except go try neighbouring less hyped stall before giving it 5 stars ! I m ok if you r a 'not local' Singaporean giving this 4 stars but 5 star is 'over the top' whatever the other good chicken stalls/chains are boon tong Kee, etc . check them out too ! the 40 deep queue at 11 to 3 is due to over hype tourist books hype
4
Long snaking queue at this food stall. The rice is tasty. However the chicken is not fat, not totally cooked and not very tasty. Even the famous sauce was lost due to the chicken quality. And the price was too high for something that has somewhat lost its zing
5
We ate here at least once a day when we stayed in Chinatown. Yes, it's that good but if Chicken rice is not your thing then there are plenty of other choices to be had at Maxwell food center, try the kampong carrot cake it's really delicious too
3
This Chicken rice shop was in our plan as it is located very close to our hotel. So this was the first meal in Singapore, we arrived at about 10.00-11.00 am. and there was a queue already. So we had to be in a line about 15 minutes and got a half chicken, Pak choi and rice to share. Um, it was just different from what I had in Thailand but I will not compare the taste as it is totally different! So the rice itself was good but can be more flavouring, the chicken was tender but little bland while Pak Choi was just normal. So all in all, it was value for money and you may love it (local do), but for us, one time is enough
4
This place near China Town. Visitor can choose what type of chicken they like. Price is worth on that 4SGD and taste is cool
5
Wonderful Hainanese chicken rice. Best ever -- highly recommend. But, be early as they run out and close when they run out of chicken.
5
Worth the queue. (It looks long but didn't take that long anyway)
Fragrant well cooked rice, great quality chicken (we ordered the drumstick), great chilli sauce, even the cucumber was great. Cannot fault. Best chicken rice I've had!
5
Really tasty chicken rice that is probably one of the best in Singapore! During peak hours, the queue can be pretty long so be prepared to wait at least 10-20 minutes!
4
Fortunately, we were staying within a 20 minute walk of the Maxwell Food Centre, and we arrived on New Year's Day. We wandered over there from our hotel, and about half the stalls were closed. Surprisingly, I had been prepared to go to a different stall, but Tia Tian was open, and there were only a few people in line. We ordered two large portions (which were actually just right) of the famous chicken rice. For what it was, it was good. Very simple dish of white meat chicken, sort of au jus, served on rice. The "sauce" is more of a special juice, and it does make the chicken moist. I was most impressed that what appears to be steamed chicken was very white in color. It was definitely tasty, but I wouldn't go out of my way for the dish anywhere. If you must try it and are in the neighborhood, then you stop by this place that has been featured on so many food shows in the U.S. BTW, the Maxwell Food Centre does a great job of keeping the area clean. There are people who bus the tables and sweep the floors regularly. Only ceiling fans, so if it is really hot, you won't cool off much inside the food court. We stopped by a few days later, and the whole center was closed for Spring Cleaning. Very Singapore
3
Went during off peak hour at 4pm and there was still a short queue of about 5 people. Ordered and paid at cashier counter then proceeded to the collection counter. It was a breeze. Food wasn't that great. I find the sauce too thick and sweet to my liking. The chicken was nice and tender though. The steamed bean sprout with cuttlefish was just average
4
This is the best place for hainanese chicken rice. The rice is aromatic, the chicken is tender and juicy, the sauce is juicy and the price is cheap ! What else do you need from a chicken rice ?Eat with their vegetables and the soup, like bok choy, to balance the taste.The only downside is a hot eating space and a quite a long que.It's located in Maxwell Road Hawker Center with the neares MRT Stop : Tanjong Pagar.(Instagram : @adjimantoro
5
Beautiful in its simplicity, boiled chicken served with fragrant rice, cooked in the boiled chicken liquid. You make it your own with chili and soy sauces. Its delicious, and it was so close to where I stayed I had to resist the temptation to have it every day
5
One of the many stalls in the hawkers' market, Tian Tian had an impressive queue. We figured if that many people were waiting to order, it had to be worth a try. We queued for around 30 minutes, then ordered the chicken rice and a side of vegetables. Delicious! A fresh, hot, filling meal at an incredibly reasonable price
3
Seriously, why the mad hype?Thanks, Anthony Bourdain.AMBIANCE=========Hawker-style.There will be a line, but it moves quickly.FOOD=====Ordered the $3.50 small order which comes with rice and steamed chicken.Chicken and rice were decent, nothing mind blowing.Rice wasn't THAT fragrant. The chicken wasn't THAT flavorful. RATING: 3/5OVERALL========It's "ai-right".Had better, but for a few bucks, it's not bad for lunch
5
Fast food at its best.
Cheap and delicious Hainan Chicken, boneless chicken works for everyone. Flavored rice was very tasty and you can even just have the rice itself.
3
There is a queue but the food is not fantastic. Not worth the wait nor the queue. Could have visited other chicken rice stall with similar taste
5
It's all the way in the back so don't get discouraged there are three rows of stalls. The wait really isn't very long and there's plenty of seating in the plaza. Food is good and cheaper than in other parts of Chinatown
4
There are many places that serve good Chicken Rice in Singapore but this has to be one of the best. There is a reason for the long que. Just melts in your mouth flavorful.
4
i'm not a chicken rice expert, but the skin tasted better here than in other chicken rice hawkers we went to
the only downside is the looooooong line. you'll be so hungry that everything you order will really taste good haha
2
The chicken i moist, but it is still one of the most boring dishes I have tried. Go for something else instead. Maxwell has a bunch of options.
4
For a very reasonable price, you get an enough serving of deliciously made chicken with rice. Though it might look very plain and simple, the chicken is soft and tasty.
3
Haven't been the same since the chef left and set up shop a few units away as Ah-Tai. Service at Tian Tian, however, is better organised: takeaways are served at one half of the stall, and eat-ins at the other. As such, the queues tend to move faster.The chicken slices are of a good size, and chewy. Rice is warm and fragrant.For comparisons, I'd suggest you alternate between this stall and Ah-Tai
4
If you speak to the locals about chicken rice one shop always comes up and it's tian tian at maxwell foodcourt. On weekends the waiting line stretches outside the foodcourt so recommend trying outside of the usual eating times. Ok so I will say it's good chicken rice. The chicken is smooth and for me it's the rice that's the standout. Fragrant and flavourful. Now is it worth the wait? Personally I would not wait 45 (or more) minutes in line for it. Two stores down is the competing chicken rice stall owned by the original tian tian cook and it's very close to the same thing that I'm happy to say if the line at tian tian goes more than 10 people long and you are not in the mood to wait then walk two stalls down and the line is likely 5 people long instead
3
Hainanese Chicken Rice is always a tasty Chinese food. For tourists and 1st timers eating Hainanese chicken rice ... obviously you will said it was good here. If you follows the social media ..... then you will be hyped up to join the long queue too. Actually, you do not find many local uncles and aunties eating here, as they can get the same or even better over the other few chicken rice stalls just around the corner in the same food court
4
We went there after 12 and there was a long line already. But the food is great. Chicken is tender and the rice is so tasty with the dark soy sauce. It was definitely worth the wait.
5
The chicken is supremely tender, and the rice is so good cooked in probably chicken stock with lots of garlicky flavor. Simple and perfect. Recommended by several people and did not disappoint.
4
Long line!
One orders first and pays, then proceed further down the line to collect the order.
Chicken was juicy and soft.
Rice was fragrant, just a tad too dry.
Tasty!
3
All the long lines of people to get mediocre chicken rice. There are stalls in other hawker centers & coffee shops who make much better. And their prices are ridiculous. It's all hype just because some celebrity chefs went there to eat. Will these chefs know to go Toa Payoh, Bukit Merah or Ang Mo Kio coffee shops / hawker centers to try
4
It was my family's first time to try authentic hainanese chicken. I ordered one whole chicken, bean sprouts & five orders of chicken rice for our family of two adults and three kids (12,7,4 years old). Chicken was COLD (this surprised me.. i did not know), FRESH, TENDER, FLAVORFUL and ORGANIC. Not the usual store bought chicken we'd usually have. Let's face it, were used to eating hot (or at least warm) chicken. It took me a while to get used to it. The chicken's skin was gelatinous and the sauces (ginger & soya sauce) were delicious. Best chicken part for me was the breast part. Got to compare it cause we had the whole chicken to munch on!The chicken rice was so umami/flavorful! Fatty but I didn't care! The bean sprouts were unusually fat, fresh and crunchy - and the sauce was sweet & salty. Delicious!They did not have drinks but the stall right across it sold so many varieties of fresh juices, shakes, cold desserts, etc. The kids loved the Milo shake! I tried the longgan juice. My husband had fresh coconut!The aunties and uncles weren't too friendly, probably due to the long queue. It was a busy lunch time when we went there. But it was okay. We were there for their famous chicken. Thanks to Anthony Bourdain's feature!Tables there are for sharing! Especially during busy hours! Just politely ask if it's okay to share!! Another tip, just bear with the long queue. It's gonna be worth it
5
Tian Tian Chicken Rice cooks better than Gordon Ramsay a couple of years ago. Its fame and popularity have since skyrocketed. At lunch time, it takes 45 minutes to get my lunch and the lineup doesn't get shorter. The chicken is silky smooth, and the rice is as fragrant as jasmine. Needless to say, it will only get busier from here as more and more people spread the words of good food, including Anthony Bourdain
5
This restaurant is only 5-10 mins walk from MRT China Town (Exit A), located in Maxwell Food court. The taste is as good as everybody tell me. The price is very reasonable and it is worth for its taste!I went there with my friends, we ordered half chicken and 4 rice. The price per person (average) is only about 4.x SGD. I have been to SG about 4 times, 3 out of 4 times I visited this restaurant and would go back again if I have chance to visit SG
5
So glad we came here to try out the rice chicken as seen on The Layover with Anthony Bourdain! The place had a line up at around 11:30am and the people just kept coming the whole time we were there. The chicken was really good, so juicy, tender and flavourful, the rice had a nice, mild orange taste to it and the veggies we ordered were mouth watering.I forget exactly what we payed for our meals but it was very reasonable. I highly recommend this place
4
Cab to Maxwell at 11am and there were few people in line. You can order chicken rice that comes with few pieces of chicken top with rice or order separately. We got half chicken and medium bowl of rice. The chicken was soft and smooth top with gravy and the rice was flavored and delicious. As we were eating the line got longer and longer
2
Many people say it's the best chicken rice, so i decided to queue up and try it. Try only the white chicken not the roasted chicken, but i feel it over rated. Not really very fantastic but ok only.Will not try again. Next, i shall try zhen zhen porridge
4
love the chicken drumstick with rice here! it taste better than the other part because it's so soft and tender!
5
This is really really good chicken rice. I waited in line about 20 minutes I think and it was worth every second!
5
deliciously fragrant and amazingly tender chicken. You can spot this place by the LONG line at lunch time, but it moves fast and is totally worth the wait.
5
This place serves the best Hainanese Chicken Rice I've had in my entire life, hands down. I've been ruined for Chicken Rice for basically the rest of my life, and can't wait to return to Singapore to have this again!
4
I like the flavours of chicken rice, I hate the fiddley bits of bone to work around. That's my review.My partner is from Singapore originally, so here's the expert review.-Chicken rice was delicious. authentic. Slightly more expensive than other places for the serving size. Chicken was cooked well with the chicken skin nicely gelatinous (as it should be). Rice could be a little more fragrant, but was still nice.
2
Over hyped over ratedIn previous years used to be quite good and affordable for the areaThe standard now is up and downMaybe business is too good - on several occasions rice was soggyThere are at least 2 stalls with better standard in the same marketIn the rest of singapore there are many better quality and value for money stall
4
People in Singapore keep talking about it. So I was there. Had my chicken. It was good. But not divorce-your-wife-leave-your-kids-move-in good. Have I had better? Maybe at some random Chinese places in San Gabriel Valley. Can't remember because it's not so memorable. But now it's off my bucket list. The ambience just killed it. maybe that's why i didn't think it was as good as people think. maybe taking it back to your air-conditioned hotel/home would make the difference. this place is in an outdoor food court with no air conditioner and it was humid and hot and the ventilation isn't the best. it doesn't appear to be the most sanitary but i was raised in china so i've seen it all. nothing can shock me anymore, it seems. in short. come try it. cross it off. if you love it, come back again.
5
Was advised to try the Chicken Rice at Maxwell Food court (the stall with the largest que)!! It was amazing, for such a plain dish, the flavours are out of this world. The chicken is so soft and the rice is so fragrant. My friend has given me the recipe for this...a must try when I get home ......(somehow don't think it will be nearly as good though
4
The chicken is so good and am so sorry that I only got the one dish if I had of known I would of taken as much as I could of carried like some of the locals they had so many dishes that they needed many family members to help carry. Next time I am in Singapore I sure will take a trolly to pick up dishes
5
The rice is so fragrant and the chicken meat is very tender. The only bad thing here is the long queue,it's like the whole food centre is only this stall is doing business. I think the best time to eat here is 14.00 onwards to avoid long queue. I queued for around 20 minutes during lunch time
5
The chicken is tender and juicy. The rice is flavorful and fragrant. What's not to like? The Maxwell Food Centre is located 10 mins from the Chinatown MRT and is easy to find.
3
Ok chicken rice, but not my favourite in Singapore... Chicken is not tasty. Rice is ok. Soup is average. Chilli and Ginger is not my liking. Black sauce is ok.
5
I must admit that when I first saw it, I was a little unsure and thought it might be a little too bland for my liking but boy was I wrong. It was fragrant and absolutely delicious!
4
An excellent choice for chicken rice, very flavorful. It always has a long line waiting, an indication of how good it is.
4
I think it is important to read a bit about the history and the preparation of this dish (and ideally have tried other version prior) to really appreciate the long queue and the zen like simplicity of this dish. I can understand many unprepared people going 'it's chicken, cold .. with rice, what's the big deal?' ... and I feel sorry for them ... Tian Tian has over the years and with some celebrity success perfected their business model, to the point that there is no charm left whatsoever .. but still very good food! Come early
5
I went to this place based on recommendation of a friend. It turned out to be a good recommendation, as the chicken rice there is very nice. I was not sure if it is the best, but it was sure well above average. The place itself and the serving is just like your average chicken rice stall, but the taste is more delicate and smoother
4
I came here twice at 6 & 7pm and guess what it's already been sold out.So the first important thing: go for lunch and not for dinner.It's located inside Maxwell foodcourtThe long line of queue just amazed meVery touristy indeedIt's delicious, big portion, the rice's really wonderful as advertised, the chicken's tender and juicy but a little bit lack of salt for me.For me it would be the most delicious chicken rice if only they add more flavour to the chicken.It's really cheap for a very touristy spotAround 5SGD for 1 big portion, good valueMy suggestion for fellow travellers: you must try this chicken rice while you are in SG, but do try another hainanese chicken rice stalls inside Maxwell foodcourt and maybe you will find the most delicious of them al

A Singaporean blog I've been following said Tian Tian at Maxwell Food Centre had the best Hainan Chicken Rice. Worst meal I've had in Singapore! Rice was soggy, chicken was over cooked - soaked in shiny cornstarch liquid.The worst thing was the 50 metre queue of tourists - I can hear Hong Kong, Malaysians, Australians, Americans, Euros.I asked myself, 'why so many tourists in the one spot?'The answer became clear. As I approached the front of the queue, there it was - Anthony Bourdain's mug plastered on the front of the stall. The speech bubble coming out of his mouth blared, 'The chicken rice is so fragrant and delicious it can be eaten on its own!'. Newsflash - the Chicken Rice at Tian Tian was not delicious.I had not known who this guy was until I started travelling through Asia, but I noticed a pronounced pattern ~ 1) American/Hong Kong/Singaporean tourists talked a lot about him, and 2) I would often eat at a highly-rated stall, be shocked that it's filled with foreigners, only to Google it afterwards to find that this 'television personality' had promoted it. Let's say this was not the only time I've been 'Bourdain-ed' on my travels (most recently in Yangon and Penang). One of my golden rules of travel now is to generally avoid restaurants promoted by television. They inevitably get overrun by foreigners, squeezing out locals, and they stop trying.I'm sure Tian Tian must have been good at some stage
5
When u want to eat the chicken rice in Maxwell ...must looking for Tian Tian chicken rice...because in maxwell have a lot of chicken rice shop and the sign look the same blue colour ....I'm recommend this Tian Tian hainsnese chicken rice it the best in the world . 
4
In my opinion this is the best chicken rice in Singapore. Recommended to my friends from Malaysia & overseas. They love the chicken rice too. The chicken is always succulent, tender & juicy. The rice is fragrant & good mouth feel. Be prepared to queue as this is a famous chip rice stall.
5
Very tasty and cheap! I enjoyed my meal very much. The chicken is very tender and full of flavour. Everything about this meal is perfect!
5
We had dinner here; chicken and rice. The portions were very large for an excellent price. Well worth the money and you get to eat with the locals. The staff were really friendly.
4
It's certainly a must whilst visiting Singapore just to say you've been, but I'm not sure it deserves quite the hype. You can expect above average chicken rice; however, vendors of equal or superior caliber aren't hard to find either.
5
After hearing name of SINGAPORE CHICKEN RICE. Here it is. The touch point everyone must observe. It could be guarantee by it's very long queue within Maxwell Food centre. Chicken is soft and super juicy! YUMMY!
3
Very long queue and it is nothing so special for the chicken rice. It is a place full with tourist because it seems like a tourist must visit spot.
5
After a guided tour in Chinatown, we asked our guide where was the best place to eat hainanese chicken rice. He directed us to tian tian restaurant in maxwell hawker centre. We arrived there at 1pm on a Saturday. Long long long queue! We were on queue for a good 15-20 min but it was well worthed. The chicken and sooooo tender, so soft and the chicken skin literally melts in your mouth. I was surprised it was so cheap under 6$ SGD. AmaZing!
4
I visited this shop around 11:30am..There was already a long queue..waited about 15 minutes to order and a couple of minutes to get my chiken rice. A serve of chicken rice and small chicken breast was $5.70 (sin dollars) Has the price gone up?? I thought it was $3.30 for a plate...anyway still cheap lunch. Nothing fancy about the shop. But the chicken was moist, tender and juicy yum yum yum! Worth try :
5
Regardless of anointments by world reknown chefs, Tian Tian serves a delicious hainanese chicken rice. It's simple, flavourful, and affordable. The chicken is quite tender and juicy. The ginger and chicken stock infused rice is the perfect complement to the chicken. We were lucky enough to be served a siding of the stall's homemade soy sauce which, I understand from our guide, is not provided unless asked
3
I don't get what the fuss about this Tian Tian. Every day they have a long queue.I tried Tian Tian on my first day having such a high expectation about the food, the chicken meat has pretty beautiful texture and the rice is fluffy yet fragrant. That's it. Not really that good.They don't give me the broth soup and charge me $5 for chicken rice although the menu says $3.50 (i hv no idea and didn't bother asking because the uncle is pretty unfriendly.)My recommendation is for you to try Ah Tai. I think it's better
5
This would be the best chicken rice I have ever had! Don't be put off by the que, it moves fast and is worth every second you wait. Everything was perfect, the rice, the chicken, the chilli sauce, all perfect! We will be visiting again before we leave!
5
The best chicken rice, I have ever tried in singapore. Always very long queue in lunch hour. The rice is very tasty and the chicken is so soft. The sauce is nice. Overall : two thumbs up!
4
It always says something about a place when there's a long line. I've been about 5 times now and its a close call between the 2 Chicken Rice stalls in the Maxwell Complex.
5
I waited in a very long queue for my turn. Luckily it's run quite fast. I loved the juicy chicken. They are so glossy and yummy.
5
long queue, I taook about 40 mins, but worthwhile. rice is well cooked. Tigh chicken is good and crispy. Well done.
4
Rice was fragrant and appetising but the chicken was the same as those from other stalls. The long queue was daunting and it didn't help that the service was not fantastic during the busy lunch hour.
5
The rice is so fragrant and delicious. If you love chicken rice you gotta go try this place out! Set in a hawker centre so there's plenty of other cheap options for food and drink too. But seriously the best chicken rice I've had!
3
Compare to a few years back, the taste of TianTian Chicken rice is not as good as it use to be. The original taste is no longer there. The rice is not as fragance as before and the meat is dried and tasteless. The chili sauce is average and there is no soup given. It look like the original people who manage the stall is no more there. The are still many people queueing but most of them are tourists who may be eating for the first time. I am a Singaporean and have eaten chicken rice for decades. And Tian Tian is just an average Chicken rice and not worth the queue
5
We've been to Tian Tian for the very first time last month during our short visit in Singapore. We absolutely love the Hainanese Chicken Rice there. The quality of marinated chickens is divine! The sauce was really nice too.I would definitely go to have Hainanese Chicken Rice again soon

In the past I have tried Hainanese chicken in different places in Singapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong from small stalls up to Chatterbox at the 5-star Mandarin Hotel of Singapore at a price 10 times of this Tian Tian. By now, I can conclude that this Tian Tian is the best in Singapore (and Malaysia) as the meat is tender, price reasonable. Yet, the best Hainanese chicken is found in Hong Kong. Those in Singapore or Malaysia are rather tasteless and plain for me, lack of the original and authentic savour of chicken that it ought to have, and the meat (even the muscle part) is not bouncy.I went last Sunday at noon time and it's a bit raining. The queue just spent me about 15 minutes
4
We queued for a while so it must be good food, chicken rice was 5 bucks each so nice and cheap, really juicy tender chicken, my tip is get extra gravy, it tastes amazing, and you can get a can of coke opposite for 1.20, worth a visit whilst exploring :)
4
It's like a food court like setting, you order your food, paid for it and take your tray of food to find a empty-seat table and enjoy, really tasty chicken and chicken flavored rice.
4
It just cost $3.50 for one plate of hainanese chicken rice. The meat is very tender and smooth but the rice is not one of the best rice for chicken rice. The illustrations is not correct as well as there is no soup given too.
5
I visited a lot of Hainanese chicken rice in Singapore, and this place served the best! Simply and delicious. Moist and the gravy was perfect. The chicken breast was also moist.
4
Delicious chicken and fragrant rice! You can order a plate of chicken on its own, or with rice. Not to be missed when visiting the Maxwell Food Centre!
3
It is tasty, but would i want to queue for 20minutes for this? maybe not. There are other stalls here that serve equally good chicken rice.
4
Went for an early dinner to the Maxwell food court, accross the road from the Buddhist temple as we didn't want to fight the crowds. Great hainanese chichen (steamed chicken served with rice), ordered Chinese veggies as well , husband ordered the chicken rice, the chicken is roasted and a couple of pieces were not cooked thoroughly.$15,for the lot!It's an experience that many tourists should embrace, obviously check what you order unless you are very adventurous
5
Love the chicken, love the rice. That's all you need to know! Go earlier as we've arrived for dinner before but they've shut as they do such good business that it sold out that day at lunch time. Queues can also be long but they move you through as quick as possible.

Said to be the best chinese rice restaurant in Singapore.Tian Tian is just a stall in the Maxwell Food Centre, which is a typical Singapore open air hawker centre near the China Town. We arrived there at around 11am and there is nobody queuing which is a big plus! (all the information I checked beforehand said one has to queue for at least 45 min to get the food).We bought half a chicken, a plate of liver and kidney, a plate of bean sprout and some rice for about S$20. The chicken is really nice - soft and with good chicken taste. And half chicken is quite a lot. The liver and kidney is also very good, particular for those who like these very unhealthy things. It is really yummy.We definitely will go back again next time
5
Absolutely fell in love with this extremely cheap and good place to eat.We spent $10 in two, but the taste was extremely good.I've never eaten such a good rice, same is for the chicken.I would highly recommend it to tourist, but of course I can't compare it with other stands yet because I didn't try.Anyway, I think I'm not trying other chicken rice, simply because I loved it and I'll eat again in the next days.Enjoy

Yes, many of the reviews are mixed. I believe it is love/hate when it comes to Hainanese Chicken Rice in Singapore as there are so many different receipes. But nevertheless, it surely is my favo chicken rice in Singapore. (We have tried three different ones)The chicken, of course, is very tender. The skin is intacted. (some of the places we had been to, actually ripped the skin whilst cutting and one restaurant even offer an accidentially-no-skin chicken rice) You might ask why it is important to have intacted chicken skin, because this shows carving skills and how well the chicken is cooked, and most important, how long has the chicken been sitting in the shelf. Their special sauce, a light brown broth is acutally what makes Tian Tian stands out. I (wild guess) believe that the broth is made of chicken stock and a hint of oyster sauce (don't quote me on that) which had formed a jelly-like broth that keeps the chicken moist and juicy!I personally really liked the hot sauce. Their special receipe I assumed, as the other chicken rice places we had been to, lacked the sour-sweet taste of their sauce. So, be sure to visit it when you are in Singapore
4
Located at Maxwell foodcourt. A must try Chicken rice, delicious and succelent. Anthony Bourdin pnce tried this chicken rice. Maxwell foodcourt is nice as we can find variety of food. They all look tempting. Price is reasonable.
5
Tian Tian at Maxwell hawker center is the ultimate chicken rice experience! The secret is really in the rice (and only secondarily in the chicken).
5
Wooooow..... If there's a hainanese world championship, I'm believe this place would be a world champion.... Its the best hainanese chicken rice I've ever had...
5
Always a queue around lunch hour. Waited 20 mins in the noon heat the first time but this is worth the wait. I love it so much that I came back for a second time in a week. The rice is well cooked and consistently tasty. The chicken though can be up and down at times (the chilly sauce would help). The rice is so good that one can finish a plate even without the chicken!Restaurant closes in the afternoon after all chickens are served. Don't wait for dinner times and come early to avoid disappointment
5
The chicken is just cooked well. Taste is good, and the rice isvfull chicken test and not oily. but by some reason... probably I forgot, that usually Hainan chicken rice should come with a soup as a set but I didn't got it this tine. Anyway, just S5 is unreasonable cheap for a meal like it
4
I tried chicken rice when I was in Tokyo couple years ago but I had to try it from Singapore, birth place of chicken rice(not sure how true it is). I must say my family and I did not disappoint, for 4-5 USD, each of us got a place of rice with chicken and a stirred-fry bean sprout with squid. The chicken and rice was flavorful. The rice was not greasy/oily and chicken is moist. I would say the chicken rice here is better than the Boon Tung Kee restaurant off River Valley Rd. One interesting note, I think Tian Tian won the Singapore vs Ramsay hawker contest, and celebrity chef Anthony B. ate here before too
5
Went out of my way to visit here based on the reviews. It was closed early one evening, having sold out, so I went back for a lunch. There was already a huge queue, mostly of locals, so I knew something must be good about it!I opted for the half chicken with the rice, was fascinating to watch it being prepared. The chicken had excellent flavour and texture, was superbly tender. The rice was a great accompaniment and the chilli sauce had just the kick I wanted.There is nothing fancy about this place, it's just excellent street food at great prices
5
Came here on a Wednesday evening at approximately 5:00pm to avoid the long lines based on reading previous reviews. To my pleasant surprise, there was no line at all. I ordered their staple Hainanese chicken rice dish. It comes with rice, chicken, sauce drizzled on top, and some cucumbers on the side. Rice was fluffy and mouth-watering. Chicken was tender and moist. Overall it was a great dish. I enjoyed it so much I ordered a second plate. Don't read too much into all the hype surrounding this place. Just enjoy the food for what it is.
4
The 3 key points (in my humble opinion) when deciding if a Hainanese Chicken Rice is good are:Chicken (duh!) - Tian Tian's chicken was well done, with the even the breast meat being relatively juicy. This might not seem like a big deal to most, but as any cook/chef will tell you it's extremely difficult to avoid drying up of chicken breast meat due to lack of fat.Rice - The rice was nice, but honestly not the nicest I've had. During the time I was there the rice seems slightly uncooked, and the infusion of chicken stock flavor was rather weak.Chili - Excellent blend of spicy and sourness. A mix of the chili and dark thick soy sauce, was good enough to act as a gravy for the rice.Overall the it's very good, but still room for improvement (RICE!!!!)
4
Came here Solo and early because I heard that the lines at this place could get long, and I am happy I was early, because after I arrived, there was a huge line. Very Very good tasting chicken and the rice was also very flavorful. If you can, have a cold beer here too. Will come back again
4
We were early before the crowd started, the rice was tastefully with chicken stock, and the chicken was tender. It taste good on its own or with the chilli sauce.
5
Liked this very much- Chicken rice done right...cooked to perfection with a generous helping. The rice is good enough to eat by itself.
Disliked - if you are unlucky the queue can be long....
4
Simple and cheap. Highly recommend it if you're in the area. There is always a line here so be prepared to wait.
2
This is my second time here and both times were extremely disappointing. The buzz is over rated and the chicken and the rice is average in taste and the texture to be soft and soggy. Almost all the other chicken rice places in maxwell are way better. Only reason this place is so hyped up is because Anthony Bourdain stopped by. If you ask me, I won't even bother.
2
Been trying this last week once, and took some friends to try yesterday. will never visit again.. comment below:-1. No soup serve anymore like in the pictures2. Too long queue3. Confirmed ..full of MSG. After having chicken, I felt so thirsty. Yesterday, I took a group of friends to try too. They all complained that tasty but thirsty and made them sick whole afternoon
4
Literally you can have Hainanese chicken rice anywhere in Singapore, but come to Tian Tian if you happen to be in Chinatown, or somewhere close to it. But watch you what time in the day you are going though. Avoid the rush hours if you can, or expect to queue up. I went there at 4pm and I get my rice in 5 minutes. However there is a chance the chicken would be sold out, so go at 2~3pm I'd say would be the best time to be so happy you made it there to taste that fragrant rice and tender succulent chicken
4
This is on my Top 5 list to do and see while in Singapore. After Anthony Bourdain raved about this place, I've been dreaming about eating the Chicken and Rice. Line was not that long when I got there since its way past lunch hour. I had to wait about 5 minutes before placing my order. The serving was fast and efficient. The chicken is tender and juicy, flavorful, the rice was fluffy, perfectly seasoned, the side order or bean sprouts was excellent, crispy and seasoned well. I must say the chicken is better at Tian Tian, but I think the rice is more flavorful at Ah Tai Hainanese Chicken which is 2 stalls down. The condiments is also better at Ah Tai. Well definitely recommend to anyone to try, must place to eat if you are in Singapore. Price is affordable.
5
You must be queueing to get your hands on this yummy Hainanese Chicken Rice. This dish worth the queue since my friend had to queue for around 30 minutes (but you may avoid the super long queue by going on weekdays or before lunch time). The meat is juicy and tender, although I'm very sure they use broiler chicken for making the dish. Super yum, will come here next time I'm in town
4
The chicken was tender, the rice super tasty and that chili sauce had a kick to it! The line was long when we got there, but moved fast so we only waited for 15 minutes. They're increasing their prices, we paid SGD 5 for a plate when it used to be 3, but it's still so cheap it wasn't much of an issue.Compared to Smith street in Chinatown, Maxwell Food Center felt much more like the real deal
3
I'm a foodie in general and Hainan Chicken Rice is one of the food that I crave constantly. I've heard about this place from time to time and decided to give it a go last week. I arrived at Maxwell food centre and marched straight to Tian Tian. Queue was okay, I had to wait for about 5 minutes before I could put my orders. Serving was fast and efficient, no complaint. I ordered Chicken rice, 5 dollars, standard price IMHO. So here goes the food tasting. The chicken was soft and tender, rice was not fluffy and a bit over-cooked. Overall, the chicken rice taste just like most other chicken rice in Singapore. I wasn't disappointed but wasn't really happy as well. I would recommend visiting Boon Tong Kee for a better Chicken rice experience
5
This was our first stop after checking into our hotel, I would have to say it would have been some of the best chicken rice I had during our holiday in Singapore, cant wait to go back to Singapore and have it again soon.
3
Boiled chicken over rice, with non-descript gravy over it. By the way people were talking about it and watching reviews from Bourdain/Zimmern, I thought this would be Food From The Gods. Not even close.
4
Was in Singapore for another contributor's trip and taken by our guide to this Chicken Rice. Nothing fancy about the shop. But that's what I like. Like most simple places with just simple tables and humble chairs, they serve good food. The chicken was moist, tender, juicy it absorb the sambal nicely and combined perfectly with the rice. It arrived on our table quickly. And also gone from our sights quickly ;-) Since my first trial, I always came back for it whenever I am in the city
3
I made my pilgrimage to Tian Tain based on the rave reviews online. The first time I got there, it was closed at 8pm. I was told they shut once the chickens are sold out. So I made another special detour to Tian Tian during another trip to Singapore, and made sure I got there early to try this fantastic chicken that everyone has been gushing about. I must admit, I was disappointed. Don't get me wrong. It was nice, tender chicken, nice subtle flavour etc, but was not as amazing as I anticipated. The chicken was not de-boned, with bone fragments inside most pieces of chicken meat; the skin was soggy and fatty. I have had better chicken in Sydney and China. I won't be back in a hurry
5
Saw this on Anthony Bourdain so we had to add it to the list. The queue wrapped around the back of the building. I don't know what they do to this chicken and I don't care. I just want it to get into my mouth now. I have never had such delicious, tender, juicy chicken in my life. If I lived in Singapore I would eat this every day
5
This place is an authentic Singaporean epicurean experience, you should start joining the queue. Chop (reserve) your seat first as it is very busy at Maxwell Food Centre. If Ramsay and Bourdain's recommendation fail to convince you to eat here, you are completely beyond help as a culinary traveler
4
I went to Maxwell Food Centre with my sister to try the famed chicken rice. There is always a line for it, but it moves quickly and the food comes out fast! There was a bit of a communication breakdown between my sister and the people in the shop because we got three dishes instead of two! The chicken rice was lovely, the chicken succulent and the rice with hints of smooth sauce. A good place to visit - chicken rice express on Killiney Rd is also a good place to get your chicken rice fix
5
Yes, you can have them everyday. Tian Tian chicken rice at Maxwell did indeed prove it could withstand its reputation. Quite good, quite tasty and the price was right too. The only angst was the queue, but would be quickly forgiven on the first spoonful of the food.We were in a queue for about 10 mins which was not too bad as sometimes it could be much longer. We ordered a half steam/half roast chicken together, with some serves of rice. The chicken was tender and sweet. The rice which could be cooked in chicken stock was nice and yummy to eat. The meal was shared amongst our family of four and quickly disappeared. We also shared some other nice dishes and drinks which will be highlighted elsewhere.We came to Maxwell on several occasions late during the evening after our day trips only to find out TT chicken rice had its door closed, while plenty other stalls opened (including 3 other stalls of chicken rice). The last time trying to beat it we came earlier and we were successfully having our meal.When there, the process was paying at one end of the double stall then given a docket to collect your meal at the other end. They worked efficiently to be able to serve the long Q.If you’re in Singapore try to come to Maxwell as both sides deserve each other; but it would be hot, no air con, only ceiling fans; but then that’s nothing for a TT chicken rice
4
When the bustle of China Town wears you down, stroll over the road to the Maxwell Hawker Center and seek out Tian Tian. We were there at about 1.30pm and the queue was only 3 people. A small dish of the chicken rice was only Sig$5 and a very adequate lunch. Moist, succulent, perfect
5
After reading so much about trying the Hawker Centers, we went to the Maxwell Center and tried the famous Tian Tian chicken rice. Highly recommend it. The chicken was very moist and flavorful and the rice had very good flavor. We came at lunch time, so it was very crowded. They have a sign board of their offerings and it's best to make your decision before you reach the front of the line. This stall had a long line, but it went fairly quickly because people knew what they wanted. I just ordered the chicken rice. You can't go wrong here if you like steamed chicken
5
Liked the food, did not like the speed, could have eaten more and also add a side dish, but one was never offered
4
good especially the drum sticks but 'tis a shame about the cheap throwaway plastic forks & spoons ...have to put up with long queues at the weekends ...
5
I love hainanese chicken rice and this Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice is brilliant ! There is always a line but its worth the wait ! don't miss out !
4
We ordered the roasted chicken and rice together with a Tiger beer it made great meal. It comes with a small cucumber and carrot salad. Also you get a bowl of chicken broth.
5
You won't miss this restaurant at the food courte because you will see the huge line to order the food, stay and you won't regret! Food is simple but very tasty and cheap! I loved it! And I have never tried so delicious rice.
5
It is worth the trip through all the Chinatown souvenir sellers to enjoy this legendary hawkers food stall. Check the service times at the Buddhist tooth relic temple before enjoying the chicken rice and other delights at the Maxwell Food Centre. There is nothing else to order just the jump in the line and enjoy the chicken rice. Grab a sugar cane juice from the stall on the same side to complete the experience
4
We'd heard about this stall from tourist guides and decided to try it out whilst in China town. The queue was very long, took about 30 mins to be served. It was just over S$7 for a large chicken rice. The food was good but it didn't blow me away as I expected given it gets such raving reviews. I had just as good chicken rice in the marina bay mall food court. Maxwell street hawker centre is smaller than I thought & doesn't have that much seating for the number of people it serves. It's somewhere I've been to from my list if places to visit & the food was good but I won't be rushing back
5
We found the chicken to be extremely succulent and the rice extremely flavorful and not too greasy. The line (or queue) was long and stretching about 12 people deep but it went pretty quickly within 15 min. They were pretty efficient and got the orders processed quickly. From a taste and price viewpoint it certainly beats many others we've eaten at, and certainly beats the pants off the ridiculously overpriced Chatterbox. Their reputation is well deserved indeed
3
This "famous" chicken rice stall at maxwell hawker centre is 1 of the star tourist and local attractions there. To avoid disappointment if you have high expectations, I suggest you go outside peak hours. Then you just wait 5mins instead of 30mins to get your chicken rice and decide for yourself whether it's worth the fuss and wait. To me, it tastes quite mundane really, and even when I was there "early" for dinner at 6pm, they were already almost out chicken, and ran out of drumsticks. I had to settle for a small normal plate which was quite underwhelming . And of course, there's not exactly an ambience to talk about
1
There was once when Tian Tian was your favorite friendly hawker center chicken rice stall that you would go to for a comfort meal. Not anymore. It's a factory production line now. At the order department, I asked for drumstick and was told it's not available, fine. I took whatever was available. At the collection department, I saw a lot of drumsticks on individual plates. I was given a plate of chicken that was full of bones. I took my seat near the stall and at the same table, a couple of tourists sat down and they had a plate of chicken which was almost boneless. At the same table a group of 3 diners ordered chicken rice from their competitor Ah Zhai. I realized that Tian Tian chicken rice factory has short changed their customers, there was no soup, no ginger sauce and no black sauce. I concluded that the choice meat goes to those who order a whole or half chicken, the drumstick/boneless chicken goes to the tourists to get a good review. And the local faithful customers gets the bony hardly any meat part. It was my worst chicken rice meal. I wished I had spotted Tong Fong Fatt Boneless Chicken Rice first. They are much better
1
chicken was too cold... liked the rice with sauce, but would have not eaten at all unless starving.
5
I have to agree chicken rice at this place one of the best I ever eat but if anyone want to try be prepare will be a line but very short wait
4
Tian Tian chicken rice has been my favourite chicken rice stall for as long as I can remember. It's chicken is very tender, coupled with great sauce. It's rice is also very fragrant. Side dishes are also equally good. Highly recommended.
4
Eating here is a cultural experience, so just go for it. You'll have to wait in line, but that's part of the experience.
5
Came to this well publicized Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice. In general, it's worth the trip and the taste did impress me. Price is decent, about S$4.00 per plate. Here's my two cents,1) Rice alone taste great, lives up to it's name. Taste great to eat even by itself2) Chicken alone is bland but texture is good, I guess the favor has gone to either the rice or the chicken oil3) Chicken with Chicken Oil(Yes, the gravy is solely Chicken oil) taste came in great, the chicken favor are all in the chicken oil4) Chilli sauce are not hot and has some lime and garlic. Be cautious if you hate garlic5) Chicken + Chicken Oil + Rice + Chilli sauce = HEAVEN!!!Lastly, expect long line..... especially during lunch time for about 30 min
5
A few of my friends told me about this restaurant in the Maxwell Food Center near Chinatown in Singapore. They said they have the best Chicken Rice in Singapore. When I went there at 10am, there was already a line up. I brought a plate of their famous Hainanese Chicken Rice for SGD $5. The chicken is so smooth, texture was excellent. The rice is so yummy. The dipping sauce is also very good. The only thing I suggest maybe is the chicken can have a stronger "chicken taste", and more cucumber slices
2
I have to agree with those who say the Hainanese Chicken Rice at Tian Tian is overrated. We made a special trip to Maxwell Food Centre on our last day to try this highly recommended dish and stand. If the food had been outstanding, it would have been worth the trouble and the less than ideal surroundings. I found the chicken and fried rice we had at a similar food center in Chinatown to be much tastier, and the facilities much more inviting. Definitely have Chicken Rice in Singapore, but I wouldn't feel as if you MUST go to this food stand to experience it
5
Chicken Rice is of course one of the must-try dishes in Singapore and this is the place to do it. Yes, there will be a long que at lunch time. Stand in it. Actually stand in any food line in Singapore, it always works out! This dish is so simple and yet so tasty. The chili sauce and the black sauce they serve it with are amazing and add so much flavor to an otherwise simple flavor. Also you cannot beat the price, S3.50
3
I echo ErikF from Manila when he says nothing special. I was really looking forward to eating Chicken Rice for the first time here and expected to be blown away.We arrived at around 7.30-8 pm and it seemed we got the last chicken rice as they were closing. The chicken was juicy and tender but cold. (Maybe it is supposed to be - I don´t know as it was our first time eating it.) The rice was good if you like ginger. Personally, for me it was a bit too strong tasting of ginger. They gave us a small pot of chilli but no other garnish, the reason being is because we had not ordered enough!Basically they were in a rush to close so maybe lunch time is better. However, there are plenty of other chicken rice stalls in Maxwell Rd so don´t be too disappointed if you find it is closed or have run out of chicken
3
I have high hopes for this one. But I was shot down. I found the chicken to be tough and dry.But the sauce is good and the Chicken rice is flavorful. Came back a day after just to be sureThat the chicken that I tasted was dud. But they were already so I settled for the restaurant nextDoor Ah Tai Hainanese Chicken Rice and I would say the chicken is way much better
4
it's OK. But compare to another place eg Thailand I don't think you HAVE TO try. The queue seems to be long but only 15 minutes I have to wait
4
I had been advised by an expat that I must try this, then Anthony Bourdain recommended Tian Tian. That made it a must do. I did queue for 20 minutes & it was well worth the wait. It was fresh, tasty & delicious.
5
They have the best chicken rice in the entire planet!!! At SGD 5, it's a real bargain. I am still dreaming about it still. Yum!!!
5
As the title, the rice was really great that I encored for one more bowl. The chicken was also OK but compared with the rice, the latter was the lead!
2
Chicken served cold, no taste at all. Had better rice and chicken at one of the food stalls in Chinatown. This resturant is highly overrated.
4
Tian tian has one of the best chicken rice in Singapore. Long queue every day so try to avoid lunch hour.
2
I normally don't like eating at food courts much because I don't want to look for tables, queuing to buy food etc. Anyway, I heard many non-locals rave about this place, I decided to give it a try while a friend is visiting me here in Singapore. While my friend went around to look for a table, I spent 15 minutes in line waiting to order and to pick up. People who work there seem grumpy, unfriendly, no smiles on their faces. I had high expectation for their food as so many people were talking about it, however, I was very disappointed after taking a bite from the chicken and rice. To be honest, I've had better chicken rice including my own home-cooked chicken rice! Their's nothing special about their rice/chicken. Not worth it, skip it and spend your money and time at a different place, perhaps an in-door food court where it's cleaner and you don't have to sweat while eating
4
Tian Tian was has been one of the most mentioned place for delicious Hainanese chicken rice. I finally made it to visit the shop during my recent trip to Singapore.Situated in the popular Maxwell food centre nearby China town, the shop was easily recognizable by the long queue in front of the shop, and its prominent and well lit signage. It's a no frills shop where everyone came for the chicken rice only. Following the queue one would have to place order and pay at the cash register, get the plate of food next to it and find a seat at one of the tables scattered around.For SGD5 only one would get a plate of rich flavored rice with juicy tasty chicken on top. An easy top pick for a excellent quick meal
4
You'll have a long debate with a Singaporean if you ask them what they think is the best Hainanese Chicken Rise Spot in the city - there's a ton of them. This place ranks as one of the best and that's asking quite a number of Singaporeans. Personally, I thought the rice, sauces and the broth were particularly outstanding while the chicken was very good
4
Chicken rice is one of my favourite dishes. When I was in university, I ate chicken rice almost every single day. Since then, I have been into the mission of finding the best chicken rice and I guess I have found one. The first time I tried Tian Tian I walked from different mrt station and it was quite far, it was super worth it! I ordered chicken rice and beansprout and seriously their I couldnt get the chicken enough, you will hit long line if you come right in the lunch or dinner time. I will definitely give them 4.5 star rating for price, food, and atmosphere (it is quick and fast kind of eatery, you couldnt expect much as it is food court). I will definitely recommend tian tian to everyone :)
3
It is nice rice and chicken is delicious. However it is not so good that it is worth to stand in line for half hour.
5
Good tender and juicy chicken rice. Even Anthony Bourday ate there. A must to try!!!! Prince very resonable. 👍👍☝
5
Can't brave the queue? Boohoo. It's incredible to think that Chatterbox is 5-6 times the price of Tian Tian. Both famous, one far more expensive than the other, but both of top quality.
5 stars.
4
I went there after 3pm which is ideal if you don't want to wait for more than half an hour in the queue. The rice was very flavoursome and the chicken was tender. I didn't find myself as thirsty as the ex-chef food a couple of stalls away
5
Hainanese Chicken Rice is one of those must-try things in Singapore and to be honest, the chicken is pretty amazing everywhere. What makes this place stand out is the rice. The flavour of the rice packs a punch because it is cooked in the chicken stock for a long time. It is definitely worth a try! They ran out of chicken drumsticks around midday, so get in early
3
Chicken Rice is the one thing everyone raves about when discussing top Singaporean food. I'm Chinese, born and raised in SF, so good chinese food is always at my fingertips. I was super excited to go to the Maxwell Hawker centre for some bomb chicken rice but was left a bit underwhelmed. The price is a bit high for a half chicken ($12) and the chicken was exactly how its prepared back home. The best part about the dish was probably the rice. It cooks in the chicken stock for a good amount of time and definitely has great flavor. If I come to singapore again, i'd probably skip this, (and all the stands for that matter), for the tastier and cleaner prepared delicacies around.
4
went there a bit after 2pm so they were running out chicken thighs already (Asians usually like thighs more as they are more tender). So we had it with a less meaty part of the chicken and it was really good! The chicken was Tender and burst with flavor and the rice was chewy and absorbed all the essence from cooking the chicken! the chickenbrice together with a bowl of nice chicken soup only codt about 3 SGD! Must try for anyone who like this local delicacy
3
Go for the white skin chicken. Rice at Tian Tian in Maxwell market is good. They're famous but generally standards at Maxwell market is high. I eat there occasionally before gordon ramsay came. Now the queues are really long. I'm a local and will go for the other chicken rice stalls inside Maxwell market. Especially the one which uses brown paper for takeaway instead of Styrofoam box. Environmentally friendly.  Don't go for the roasted skin chicken at Tian Tian. Its dry compared to other stalls.
4
Who would have thought that a dish so simple could be so delicious and comforting. Had to try some Hainan chicken rice after watching Anthony Bourdain on No Reservations rave about Tian Tian! Luckily our hotel was literally walking distance right across from the Maxwell food court so I was ready to eat this every single day it was that delicious!! For $3.50 Singapore dollars which was basically equivalent to ~$3 US you get a pretty decent portion of chicken and rice plus a bowl of the chicken broth. The rice smells heavenly. The chicken is moist but pretty bland by itself. However, it's all about mixing the chili sauce and brown sauce with your chicken! My goodness! There is usually a line so be prepared for a wait but there at Tian Tian the service is pretty fast! Definitely a must have while visiting Singapore!!
3
Since I heard a lot of this place I travelled from Bencoolen to This place to try the so called best chicken rice in SG. After being in the Q for 15 odd minutes, go to taste an average chicken rice. Rice was nice but chicken had bones in it and was overcooked. There are other places that serve better chicken rice so this place is definitely overrated

The chicken was soft and juicy but the nice jelly skin non-existent. The rice was the biggest let down though. No dedelicate fragrance. I've had better chilli sauce too. Would not recommend. Maybe go to the stalls next door.
1
Stood in line and thought I was in for a treat but chicken rice was greasy and a little gross to be honest. Horrendous service.

Best Hainanese Chicken, comparable for me that is with Chatterbox located at the ground floor of the Mandarin Meritus Hotel. And even better tasting and cheaper too !
4
Place is famous due to all the TV press and tourist websites claiming it is the best in all of Singapore. Is it the best? The rice here is unmatched hands down. I think the chicken was eh... The super long line is what did me in... God that line was long. Personally, I think Tiong Bahru Boneless Hainanese Chicken Rice is a little bit better but that could because there are rarely any lines there

This is raved by many as a 'die-die-must-try' dish in Singapore. Bourdain and Ramsay had given their stamp of approval, so I figure I should give it a try.We came on a Saturday, at 1.30pm, and the queue was already around the corner. However, it moved quite fast, and in 15 minutes we got to the counter and ordered 3 chicken rice (rice with chicken on top, not rice and chicken separately).The chicken was moist, tender, and the skin so thick and glossy it is almost like gelatin. Without the special sauce (like soy sauce but not exactly soy sauce) on top of the chicken, I found it to be a bit bland, as I like my chicken with more garlic and sesame-oil taste.The rice was another thing. It was fragrant, oily (in a good way) and beautiful. I really could eat the rice alone and be happy. I really could say that the rice at Tian Tian was the best hainanese-chicken-rice rice I've ever tasted, and yes, I've tasted quite many chicken rice in Indonesia and Singapore. To me, the die-die-must-try is the rice.For a plate of chicken rice (rice with chicken on top), I paid SGD 3.50, and it was definitely a fulfilling dish, in portion, taste, and price.When you look at it, the presentation is indeed flat. But perhaps, that's the beauty of this dish, the simplicity, and how the taste speaks for itself.As for service, you really can't expect much for the aunties or uncles at Singapore hawker centers. Know what you want to order before you reach the counter (in front of the stall are big signboards with menu and price), don't expect niceties like hellos, how are yous, and thank yous. Order, pay, move to the next counter to pick up your order.I don't think the 30-minutes (or more) queue on weekends and lunchtime is worth it, though. Come early before 12pm or a bit later after 2pm and come on weekdays
3
Heard people talking about tian tian chicken rice so many times. After waiting for long queue about 20mins finally tried, went there sunday around 5pm so definitely picked the right time. Totally dissapointed with the taste, less than what I expected since this stall holds the tag for one of the best hainanese chicken rice in Singapore. The chicken was too soft, rice too dry. Simply could not understand people are still eager to queue everyday. No offence
4
Looking at my plate of pale, room-temperature, boiled chicken on top of a mountain of rice, I thought, "we cued 30 minutes for this?!?"We specifically went to Maxwell Road for this, and initally, I was taken aback. I had wanted hot, vibrant looking food. That's not what chicken rice was. The colours were in the sauces and the garnish of vegg, not on the hero that is the chicken. Then again, the charm of the dish is in exactly how it is prepared, cooked, and presented - simple, cold and all. I definitely liked the flavours of the chicken rice in Tian Tian, but I wonder if the cue is a result of Bourdain's featuring it on 'No Reservations'. The line was not that long in the show, compared to what it is now. But that's just a presupposition.I just wonder, with the mild and mundane flavours of the dish, how many variations can it have? I enjoyed Hainanese chicken rice in Malaysia a few days before this trip to Maxwell Road and was not disappointed, even after having tried Tian Tian's famous version. There wouldn't be a secret spice or procedure, right? It is Hainanese chicken, meaning it is prepared a specific way. I reckon if there would be variations, it would be in the condiments. But, would I go back? Sure. But not because I craved for Mr. Loi's (?) version of chicken rice. I would return as one would revisit a tourist attraction, say a museum, unless I'm really hungry
4
As a Singaporean, I have been eating chicken rice all my life. For the last 20 years or so, it was pretty clear to me that the standard of chicken rice has been slowly declining. Although Tian Tian chicken rice is not the best I have eaten, it is probably the last few good chicken rice stalls in Singapore. The rice is fluffy and fragrant; the chicken is chopped to much chunkier sizes as compared to many places (this is a personal preference), needless to say it's very succulent; and their side dishes such as the chicken web and gizzard are cooked just nice (not overcooked). The stallholders are friendly, fast and quick to serve the long queues, so waiting time is not really an issue. In my opinion, it's great chicken rice overall; it may even be outstanding to non-locals who do not eat chicken rice often. Definitely worth a try if you haven't tasted it and definitely worth coming back to
5
You can expect to wait quite a while but for the delicious, cheap chicken rice it's worth it. The first time I visited they had run out of chicken (!) but I returned the next day and wasn't disappointed. The service is efficient and no-frills. Good for a snack or a quick easy meal
4
I enjoyed the chicken rice, tho' other locals said that they found it a bit oily. I tried other stalls in other neighbourhoods and they were nice but not as flavoursome. The rice had that little bit more body and the gravy was more substancial. The server had his oriental brashness, as is the way in these parts. Fast food experience delivered at a fast and furious pace.I'm in the same camp as Anthony Bourdain when it comes to this place - and I make "No Reservations" in saying so . . . !!
4
Always long queue in front of the stall! But worth waiting! Chicken meat is soft and juicy. Rice is fine. If you have tried the rice in Bangkok, you will understand that rice in Singapore is not so good as in Bangkok.
5
There is something special about the chicken rice here, just has a very authentic taste and local atmosphere. It's not a very rich tasting meal, but if your looking for cheap and local don't go any further!
4
Very long queue but it was worth it. Cheap and great value in the hawker centre
The chicken rice was great and did not disappoint. I recommend going early around 10-11am so the line is not as long.
5
A very delicious meal that comes with affordable price. The rice is fragrant, the chicken is juicy. All in all, I was so happy after the first bite and wanted to have more and more, only if there's more room in my stomach. I still remember the taste as it was so special. Come early to avoid the queue

After a long, scorching stroll around Chinatown's alleys, our pack trudged through Maxwell Food Centre (within the vicinity of the huge Buddha Tooth Relic Temple) for lunch at the storied Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice stall. Didn't need directions upon entering the food court -- the queue was conspicuous enough, situated in the middle. Waiting time took past half an hour.Had the regular set for nearly 4 SGD, which consists of 1 piece white chicken on top of steamed chicken rice, broth, and the sauces. I had really high expectations of how delicious it is, hearing so many raves about it. Maybe it's just a matter of taste, but I did not find their version of the chicken flavourful (bland even). Normally I don't even dip chicken in sauces, but for this occasion I needed to (I guess that is the part of the magic). The rice was steamed perfectly and fragrant. It wasn't the best chicken rice I've had, but I still enjoyed it because of the local element - another one ticked off the must-do Singapore food trip
4
As a Singaporean I have tried many other chicken rice and have tried to avoid the queue at Maxwell Tian Tian. This morning we decided to go there for brunch and join in the queue. The chicken was succulent and rice was fragrant. The chilli was also nicely spicy. Yum. Will be back for more
4
10軒ほどチキンライスを食べ歩きましたが、個人的に味・値段のバランスがここが一番いいだと思いました。そりゃ高い値段でおいしいチキンライスを食べられるのは当然ですが、3SD台でこの味はほんとにすばらしいと思います。ランチやディナーの時間帯は行列になっていますし常に10分くらいは待たなければなりませんがその価値ありです。スタッフの対応はあまりよくないしフードコート内なので席取りもちょと手間がかかります。それでも毎日行列ができているということはそういうことなんでしょうね。ちなみにシンガポール人5人くらいに「一番おすすめのチキンライスは？」と聞いたら、全員ここって返してきましたｗI had chicken rice at ten restaurants in Singapore, and this shop was the best balance of taste & price! It's no surprise that you can meet delicious one if pay a lot of money, but It's amazing to be able to eat this tasty chicken rice with around 3.5 SD. not good staff service and long queue though. I asked five Singaporean "which chicken rice is the best?" , they gave me same answer. haha :
5
Went back three lunch times and joined the queues of locals waiting for this dish - Legendary remarkable chicken rice - the best I have ever tasted succulent perfectly prepared perfect sauces perfect rice and perfect soup full of flavor -If it was open at night I would have been back The owner needs to be given Singapore's living legend award and the keys to the city even made prime ministe
5
Gordon Ramsay lost to TianTian in a friendly Singapore Hawker competition, but that's not the point. Anyway Tian Tian is one of the most popular Chicken Rice Stalls in Singapore. As a Singaporean, i gotta say the chicken rice is GOOD! Fragrant rice, succulent steam chicken, the combi is fantastic and it doesn't cost a bomb for it. Do try it if you are in the area. Anyway the queue is always Long, due to MANY tourists queuing for it. However you do not see many locals queuing. The food is good, but I personally do not feel that it's worth that 20 to 30 mins queue for a plate of chicken rice. There are at least 4 other chicken rice stalls in the same hawker center. Join the queue if you are a first timer, try other stalls if you are lazy to queue (i.e. Me
4
Honestly, if you explain to anyone how simple a meal this is, you wouldn't expect it to be anything special, but it's a real treat. We both had the chicken rice after waiting in line. The staff helpfully/quickly showed me how to best eat it, and we sat down. It was SO good, very cheap, and one of our favorite meals in Singapore
4
Tian tian hainanese chicken is juicy. The meat is very tender. What i don't like is, there's a little redness near the bone. In other country, they have stop the practice of medium cook. But other wise perfect.
5
this chicken rice was rated by Anthony Bourdain as one of the best, the name speaks for itself. we had our 3rd time:)
5
Very authentic Hainanese Chicken Rice, succulent chicken with the chilli sauce, make the queueing all worthwhile. Go during odd hours if you don't like long long queue.
5
We've been coming here for years, and it's a must stop for my family whenever we come to visit Singapore. The negatives are that it's outdoor, and it's not the cleanest place to eat. Also the wait...But the chicken is very tender, the rice flavorful. Add a few cups of sugarcane juice, and it's simply a wonderful lunch. Be sure to get the hot sauce and the chicken broth
5
It is what it is, good chicken rice consisting of good silky chicken, rice packed with flavour, tasty sauce and chicken stock soup. You just have to patiently wait in line for 40mins, and then pay $5 bucks for a serve. It's brilliant if you can live with the line. We were there at 2.30pm on a weekday
1
If you're like me (i.e. a westerner) you might be expecting something akin to the chicken and rice dish you know and love back home... perhaps with some funky asian spices thrown in to boot. This is not that. Its cold, fairly bland, and overall utterly disgusting. They've somehow achieved the impressive feat of serving up raw-but-cooked chicken. The whole dish is white - no tasting charring, no burnt edges... just white and gooey. The white, dotted skin of the chicken, and the accompanying layer of chicken fat, dominates the dish. If you want meat, its a bit of a mission... you have to dig around the bones, fat and skin to pull away the rare piece of boiled (tasteless) white meat. Which begs the question... why not just boil your own at home? Better yet, cook it properly and enjoy chicken the way it ought be enjoyed! Came to Singapore with my adventure hat on, ready to explore the best of Asian cuisine. After a gruesome experience at 'clay pot' and a second fail with Tian Tian... I'm about ready to throw in the towel. Another two weeks here... the thought of another 'haiwanese chicken rice' makes me feel ill. Really, physically ill. Think I'll be relegated to the Western intrusions for the rest of my stay. American fast food surely beats the questionable hygiene and unfamiliar cuts of meat in Singapore's hawker centres...
5
It's big, juicy, tender. People queue up during lunch and dinner just to get a taste of their chicken, and the wait is all worth it. A whole chicken is good for 6-8 persons; rice is ordered separately if you're getting the whole chicken. When ordering the a whole chicken, recommend making it half roasted and half steamed so you'll be able to taste both without the additional cost. Tips: 1. Be sure to get table before you order. it can get hard to get a table on peak hours. 2. You can share table with other people.3. Bring your own tissue paper
5
This place received raving reviews but the first time we went the queue was just way to long to wait so I've grabbed some Haianese chicken from another stall, however the temptation to have the meal at Tian Tian was still there so the next day we went really early. At about 10-10:30 we got this famous meal, only a very short queue and we were served.It was fantastic! Absolutely loved it. The chicken was very moist but with a subtle and wonderful taste. The rice was amazing and I'm not a huge rice eater but I couldn't stop eating it and the chilli sauce which went with it absolutely fabulous,Tian Tian is already on our to 'revisit' list when we go back in a few months time, absolutely worth it and the prices are great too
5
I found this stall by wandering around Maxwell Road Food Centre, looking at what people were eating, picking the most gluten free option, and judging the length of the queues. Long must mean it is a decent feed. I wasn't disappointed. Delicious, fragrant rice and succulent chicken. They understood when I mentioned I needed gluten free and put a note on my order not to put the gravy on. The meal was still very tasty, even without the sauce. The red chilli paste is a wonderful accompaniment. Just treat it with respect. When I ate there in the morning I received a bowl of broth. The queue wasn't too bad. When I went back for a late lunch the following day, the queue was round the corner and no broth. Friendly, efficient staff. A well oiled operation. Highly recommended
4
Came outside the main lunch time period, around 3pm, short wait and was served. As mentioned by Anthony Bourdain the fragrance of the rice is fantastic. My kids also thoroughly enjoyed the rice. The chicken, the broth and the chilli sauce were all good but not great. Overall happy we went, the neighbouring juice stands in the Hawker centre were also very good. If in Chinatown I would go again
5
the dish is meant to be served cold, which is unusual for many people. The chicken was juicy and the rice was plump with chicken broth. Bought 2 plates to avoid lining up again - must recommend!
4
Visited this hawker stall around lunch time. Was certainly the busiest with a long but fairly fast moving queue. Staff were flat out and no smiles or finesse about the service. Chicken was tasty but somehow the experience was dulled by the service.
5
Fragrant rice, tender chicken, and tasty soup! I think it's much better if they also provide soy sauce and chilies to accompany the dish.
5
There are other decent chicken rice stalls in Maxwell but you should try Tian Tian first. As evidenced by the long but relatively quick line, locals and tourists get their fill of Hainanese Chicken Rice here.Chicken is plump and juicy, and despite it being just steamed, very flavorful. The rice, as Bourdain says, can be eaten by itself. Careful though, their version has bones in it, perhaps the reason why it's more flavourful unlike the other stalls' more convenient, though blander, boneless offerings.It's very affordable too
4
Succulent chicken served with a well-flavoured broth and rice. Not fancy, perhaps not all that aesthetically pleasing, but well worth queuing for. Visitors to Singapore should be aware that it is traditional to serve the chicken at room temperature (but the rice and broth hot). Some of the disappointed reviewers, here, seem to have expected piping-hot chicken
5
this is my 5th time in Singapore and I wanted to try the "best" Chicken rice. So after a few minutes of googling and watching Anthony Bourdain's episode on youtube, i decided to come here. The line was long when i went around 4pm. The lady at the hawker center didn't talk much, all you have to do is tell her what you want. The chicken was perfectly cooked. The only complaint was i didn't come back for the second time =
5
Ok, so I am a huge Anthony Bourdain follower and it was because of the great Bourdain that I put this place on my "places to visit" list during my recent holiday in Singapore. The joint did not disappoint. The chicken was perfectly boiled and was not mushy or watered down. The chicken had been boiled in special stock water and so it had a distinct fragrance and flavor. Same idea with the rice. The dipping sauce was divine. It helped coalesce everything great about this unassumingly scrumptuous dish. Reasonably priced. Ate there at 3pm on weekday and there was no line at all. Probably a different story during the lunch and dinner hours. Had a cold Heineken with the meal and I was good to go for the reason of my Singapore "walk". I even had chicken rice from another stall in Maxwell. No comparison. Minimalist brilliance at its finest
4
We had a simple reason for going here - Bourdain. The MAN said the hainanese chicken was great, and the owner has posted all these newspaper and magazine clippings to make sure that all and sundry will know that he said it. The line was long but moving, and when we finally got our chicken and rice, we happily ate it all. Late diners take note, they close at around 8pm, but nearby stalls offer not-disappointing alternatives, as we found out on our last night in singapore
4
My partner and I went to Maxwell Food Center and were originally hesitant in getting in line at Tian Tian. We got (also delicious) meals from other stalls, but that wasn't good enough for me. Nowhere near. Without saying a word, I got up and walked to the back of the 35-40 person line, which weaved around numerous corners like one giant chicken hungry snake. Eventually, it was my turn and I promptly asked for a half chicken and a 70 cent rice. I got it reasonably quickly and took it to the table where my missus and I tucked in to the highly hyped piece of poultry.A little cold it was, but the brown gravy like glaze heated it up somewhat and it was absolutely yummy. My partner (who usually eats less than an ant on a diet) and I ate it all in quick time without fail; a testament to how great it was. Is it worth waiting in line? It was for us, but we did have chicken rice from other places that were still great. So it's up to you whether it's really worth your time. If you're there though, I say get yourself a chicken and tuck into that little feller
2
So, in touring the Chinatown area, my plan was to visit the Maxwell Road Hawker Centre and grab a bite here. The rave reviews for the chicken rice made this worthwhile. So, around midday on a Saturday, I parked myself in line to wait. Granted there was confusion because there is a "pay" line and a "food" line - both were very long - and customers were confusing the two. I placed my order in line 1 and waited in line 2. When I sat down (plenty of open seats for a solo diner) my expectations were dashed. I tried the chicken and it was flat out cold. Not just lukewarm, but cold. I made sure it was cooked (no red), but apparently during the reheating it did not get hot at all. I actually ended up placing the chicken pieces in the broth (soup) and let them warm up in there. I do understand things get busy, but this is a major fail for me. Cold food. YIKES
4
this area has really good food, tian tian is one of them. go slightly later to avoid the queue. they usually sell out at about 9pm. be adventurous, try some chicken liver, or gizzard. service is average.
3
Wow, very long lines for both order and receive foods. I didn't think "Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice" was the best chicken rice in Singapore, but I thought that one of the best foods at Maxwell Food Centre.
3
it's famous and with a long queue, but the rice was dry and the chicken was tasteless. there are better "hainanese chicken rice" in other parts of south east asia....
2
The restaurant is very basic and not very tidy. Some waitresses do not speak English. Their famous chicken rice is extremely disappointing. Other dishes are not better.
3
The taste of the hainanese rice is the same as other stalls. I don't know if it has changed but for me there was no a "wow" factor when I tried it.
3
The taste was moderate but one good thing is the chicken was juicy. The rest i would say it was really moderate
4
There are a few chicken rice stalls in this centre but this one always seem to have a long line every time I visit. Yes the line is made up of a lot tourists who saw the Anthony Bourdain episode but the chicken rice is still worth the queue time. Don't expect any pleasantries when you order. know what you want, order quickly, take your receipt and move along very quickly...an experience for the uninitiated! They seem to have expanded the menu to include some side dishes but you are better off trying some of the other stalls for these. If there are two or more of you suggest you go for a half or whole chicken between you plus rice. Much better value. Try to get a seat outside in the open. If you're lucky you may even find a breeze. The inside of the centre can get very hot and humid
4
Had to search a bit for this place which is very close to chinatown. There was a long queue for lunch as expected. But the wait was worth every penny. Decently priced and awesomely tasty, this place is good if you do not like too much of spices
4
This version of chicken rice is quite delicious compared to many others that I have tasted. The chicken is moist and juicy, even the chicken breast meat. The rice is fragrant and fluffy and at the same time, isn't too oily. The chilli sauce is definitely a winner too and contains that extra kick - because of the usage of lime juice instead of vinegar as an ingredient.There is usually a queue during peak meal times, but the wait is definitely worth it.It is certainly a version of our chicken rice that I would patronise again when I have the craving for chicken rice.To see some pictures and read a more in-depth review, do check out my blog post: http://www.prischew.com/food/best-hawker-chicken-rice-singapore
5
Empire cafe@ Raffles is nodoubt, but if you want to try something local Tian Tian is fine choice.Chicken Rice served with tasty Chicken soup, queued up for 6 to 7min to had my late lunch never makes me feel any stress but just amplify my appetite
4
The chicken rice is really delicious and not expensive. We arrived the food centre just after lunch hour and the queue took us 15 to 20 minutes. I took one serve and I would love to have one more!
4
So good, although you must wait too long to get what you want but it deserves. Chicken and rice are soft, and price is not too expensive.
2
I'm not even going to waste words. Disappointing chicken rice.. Save your time (10 minute queue) and money. Very average and no broth. Was this an off day- we'll never know as we wouldn't go back.Go elsewhere- plenty of others to chose from.
4
One aspect of food in Singapore to note is that their standards are very high, and competition is stiff. This hawker stand food became even more famous after being on television, so the lines are always long. I waited (queued up) about 20 minutes. Service is average, and they will yell at you if you aren't prepared to order by the time you reach the front. The chicken and the rice were very good, and probably better than any equivalent offering available in the United States. It's probably average in comparison to other Hainanese Chicken in Singapore. The soup broth was mediocre.I'd definitely return again, but would try other Hainanese chicken stands in the city first
4
The chicken, sauce and rice are all nice. Soup is average. We queue up for 30mins for order, and self service. The staff is not really friendly, probably because they are too busy. The food court is hot, so prepare to sweat a lot having lunch there
4
I tried the one in Maxwell Road Hawker Centre & found it's not really that good. But then I tried their outlet in Joo Chiat Road & found the chicken rice is more delicious and the restaurant is more comfortable, although a bit more expensive. But it's worth
3
Chicken Rice is available on every corner in Singapore and although the quality and portions vary in general it tastes more or less the same everywhere. For some reason this restaurant has now become the famous one where even international celebrity chefs like Gordon Ramsay head to because of its fame. It seems a bit pointless to make a detour for it since your average Food Republic or run-of-the-mill hawker center will be able to serve you something similar Katong is a lovely area for a stroll and has plenty of other excellent dining option.
1
Been there cause everybody Tian Tian is a must in Singapore.... But...it was not close to a word tasty at all.Lots of people said Tian Tian chicken rice is legendary thing that you must have if you are going to Singapore. This is all completely wrong. After lined up for more than half an hour, I REALLY disappointed in the TASET period.It is just eatable, but not even close to the word delicious.Another thing I did ordered regular size which the price should be only 3 S$ according to the price list, but they charged me for 5 S$. Careful for what you ordered. They do not have a standard in the pricing. It is all up to them.If you are looking for Singapore style chicken rice, go some other place.Does not worth it
3
Finally ate at this stall in Maxwell Market. In comparison, there are quite a few chicken rice stalls here.I arrived before the lunch crowd so I gladly bought a plate. The rice was soft (maybe too soft / soggy for some) and the meat was quite tender. The sauce that they used was quite unique in that I had not had that kind of sauce at other chicken rice stalls. I prefer deboned chicken so this was a minor disappointment. I also prefer saltier sauces so the sauce will appeal to those who are more health conscious than I am.All in, I should think that I will only try this again if the queue was maximum 5 people and even then maybe never since there's another stall in the same centre that I prefer. It's good but not amazing.$3.50 a plate which is normal. (I usually get a plate of chicken rice for $2.50 near my place though
4
Went to Maxwell food court with family and had tried the chicken rice today. Meat was very tender and rice was quite nice fragrant and delicious. The only shortfall was the queue. Extremely long. Pay first and come food concept in another lane. Good to try once. No ambience since it's located in the food court and no service. If you are lack of patience. Go Boon Tong Kee chicken rice as most of their shops were air condition. Try this for once. If you like come back and be prepared to queue. A bowl of chicken rice cost $3.50. Reasonable portion... Based on reviews. This seems to be the most popular chicken rice amongst local..
5
Best Chicken Rice ever. At Maxwell Foodcourt Chinatown. very cheap only 4 Dollar you get Drumpstick chicken rice.
3
It's nothing fancy. You could make this in your home and if you can't you should not be out traveling the world. The location I went to was over in China Town. It was quick but the food court area was packed and finding a seat may be a trick. Besides that I don't know if I would go out of my way to eat this dish. There is so much more in Singapore that's worth seeking out in terms of food
5
We went here on the recommendation of friends who swear it's the best place to eat chicken rice. It was my first experience so I wouldn't consider myself an expert on chicken rice but we loved it. I consider it a good place to start your food adventure in Singapore

This review is for the Tian Tian branch located at 443 Joo Chiat Road rather than the more famous Maxwell Hawker Centre location. I happened to stumble across this restaurant while wandering around the area as I was staying at a hotel nearby so decided to try it out as I have eaten chicken rice at the Maxwell Food centre a couple of times in the past and always enjoyed it. For starters this is more like a "proper" restaurant than a hawker centre so indoors with aircon and white painted interiors (and price premium to match) I had a chicken rice set and whilst it was decent & tasty enough - it seemed to be lacking something that the Maxwell version has. I visted quite late in the evening so that may have had something to do with it. If you're in the area I'd recommend it but wouldn't suggest a special trip to visit this branch - just visit the original location
5
I went to the Joo Chiat - Tian Tian hainanese chicken rice restaurant. It was around 5:30pm on a Wednesday, it wasn't crowded. I ordered steamed chicken rice for 1 with soup and cutterfish with beansprout + lemon ice tea for $15. The chicken is soft, lender, juicy and yummy. The beansprout is also great too. Their service is fine and serve up quickly.Also, SBS transit no.16 bus stop is only 2 mins walk away
2
The hype machine strikes again. Make some rice with garlic. Put some boiled chicken on it. Seriously, you can easily do this at home.Because of limited seating, I sat with a friendly Singaporean girl. It was her first time eating at Tian Tian, because the stand she usually eats at wasn't open yet.She said it was just okay, not great. And she said the rice was a bit too rich. Not sure what that means. Anyway. That's my review
2
Having not come back to Tian Tian for a while, i was pretty excited to have been able to call ahead and pick this up for a party of 5 for dinner. i did not really think about it but Tian Tian had been delivering good quality chicken rice for a while now- hence its well gardnered reputation. i also remembered they lost one of their chefs a while ago, but i did not figure this to be a key issue.Well- having tasted the chicken last night- i can tell you it is a BIG issue. Rice, Chili, Black Sauce, Ginger all rank high up there as far as quality and standards are concerned. But the chicken standard has dropped to pittance. Dont bother trying. i know the other chef opened a Chicken Rice stall at Maxwell. Not sure you want to try that one. But also Tong Fatt (the one with photos of our Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew and current Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong) is also there, and i can tell you Tong Fatt serves up a much better chicken rice without doubt.Sad. Last time i am trying Tian Tian
4
Portion is just nice. From the powerful chilli to the rice and chicken. Everything that makes a good chicken rice is present. The rice is cooked to perfection not too hard or soft. The chicken is tender with a tinge of lemon and present in chunky bits.
4
We went to this local food market after watching Anthony Bourdain visit it. It helps to know a ittle history of the place before going, it made the experience that much better. You can almost immediately spot the place by the long line. The first line you wait in is to order the food. Then you get a claim ticket and stand in another line to actually get your food. Chicken and Rice is their most famous dish, 3.00 for a small and 3.50 for a large. The food is excellent, seems simple but really tastes good. If you travel with multiple people have one stand in line, then someone find a seat as the place fills up. There are also lots of fresh juice stands right next to this stall. Overall a super place to eat and is a great way to experience local food

I visited the Simpang Bedok outlet for a takeaway. For starters, I received an extremely hostile treatment the very moment I stepped into the eatery, which was supposedly an air conditioned restaurant with premium pricing. I took quite a while to decide on the item I wanted to order. Even then, that was just two minutes delay and there wasn't any other patrons in the eatery. I was further 'greeted' with more hostility when I asked for an extra packet of dark soy sauce and chilli sauce. Obviously, this eatery serving common fare with premium pricing needs to work harder to be considered a restaurant. This place certainly doesn't have to worry about shortage of its chilli and dark soya sauce because its restaurant crew guards them with their lives and I certainly won't be stepping in to make any request for the sauces ever again

I like the chicken. The texture was very soft and yum but the gravy was very salty - way too salty for me.
5
The taste was so good n the chicken texture so soft...don't come too late or all chicken were sold out...must try !
5
This chicken rice shop is the best in the whole Singapore.. Be it any other famous ones, this one is still the best :)
Loving it!
4
I was at Maxwell at about 9 and the Tian Tian staff told me that they would start at 10. Went to the City Museum next door, went back at 10, waited a bit and ordered. I was not disappointed. The Chicken Rice was good.
5
The chicken rice at Tian Tian is the best one we have had so far. Granted, I have probably only had 5 or 6, but this is definitely one to go to.We got there by recommendation, and then were surprised to find that it was the same one Anthony Bourdain visited a few years ago (the have a picture next to the cash register). The rice and chicken were delicious, and the bean sprouts were very nice. In general, the combination was very good! The price was 15 SGD for 3 people, which is about average for a hawker centre.The juice stall was also very nice (cant remember the name).The locale is decent (pretty much like you would expect any hawker centre), with working fans. We were there during lunch time on a work day, and it was very full, so keep this in mind. There was also about a 5-10 minute queue for the rice (but here, no queue, no good...).In general, very highly recommended
4
Even though there were several Hainanese places in the hawker center, we tried this one based on the hype. The chicken was very tender. The rice was not as fragrant as others have described and the soup was just average. We also ordered the bean sprouts which was delicious. Considering how expensive it is to eat at a sit-down restaurant, we were very happy with the food at Tian Tian.
5
Don't need to write much about this. Enter maxwell food centre and it's the hawker stall with the queue. Easy the best $3US you'll spend. Straight forward, Hainan chicken, rice, dipping sauces.Across from it, get pearl milk teas and exotic juices like jackfruit or soursop for $1.It's in a food court so don't expect atmosphere. It's all about the food. You may have to share tables with other people. Go late afternoon for less people (we were lucky).Don't miss it! MUST TRY
5
If you come to Singapore do not pass this stall. I with my wife and my daughter always come to here where in Singapore. Even it is very crowded at the lunch time but very worth it. Try the beansprout and skinless chicken. Very yummy. Do not worry with the price. Not too expensive compare with another stall. You will be satisfied. Trust me
4
After reading so many reviews, we had to try Tian Tian! We ordered a large chicken rice each, which was $5SGD and came with two breasts of chicken - which is amazing value! We arrived at 11:30am to avoid any queues, there was only a small queue of 5 people, but the queue was huge when we left.The chicken was well cooked and the sauces spicy. The portion serving was huge - especially after eating plane food for 14hrs prior!The broth and rice were good too. I do prefer Loy Kee's chicken rice though.
3
I read a lot about Tian Tian hainanese chicken rice from internet reviews so I decided to join the long queue during lunch time. The rice was a bit hard, not as fragrant as I thought. The chicken was tender but a bit bland. The price was okay. But look away from the dirty dishes tray, you definitely don't buy cleanliness there :
3
We went to Maxwell food centre for this as our first meal in this Singapore trip. The portion is big and the price is very reasonable. But, I was disappointed as the taste is just average. Not impressed.
2
the rice no longer that fragrant as before. maybe standards dropped slightly. yet there are many people queuing for this stall. there are some other stalls around in maxwell market offering better taste and experience minus the queue and wait.
4
We went to the one at Maxwell center. Though need to queue for a bit, but the rice is nice and chicken is tender.
The spicy sauce is great too.
4
Great smooth and tender chicken with great chilli and soy sauces! The rice cooked with chicken stock is one of the best I've tasted.
5
Cant believe i can find such a nice chicken rice here! Very very nice! Must try when you visit Singapore. Price is affordable.
4
My office was near there. I used to eat there quite often. The rice is tasteful, the chicken portion is good, soup is tasty. You can ask for big bowl of soup if you like. I did it everytime i eat.
5
Saw this place on the show 'No Reservations' with Anthony Bourdain, so of course we had to try it on our trip to Singapore.We walked a good 2.5 miles from our hotel to get here, but well worth the walk. Such a fun market place full of different foods and drinks, and across the street is the out door market place where they sell clothes and other goods. China town is one of the best things about Singapore, and so is Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice! The line is usually a bit long, and the lady there who is in charge keeps it moving (very organized). The rice is perfect and delish, and the chicken is very tender, and you will also get a bowl of Miso soup as well with your order. Make sure that you get the sauces that go with it (a spicy sauce and a thick teriyaki sauce) and your spoon and fork. The entire meal for both my husband and I was about $4.20 (American dollars). Amazing right?So glad that we tried it! So Delicious! It's a must go to when visiting Singapore
3
In all fairness, Singaporeans are very picky on street food n the best gauge if how good or bad the food is how long you queue for your food at peak hours.Here it's always a long if not longest queue at lunchtime so you have your answer. I noticed most foreigners comments are its awesome, scintillating etc. I m not surprised ESP if they are from western countries where steam chicken is unusual meal as they normal have their chicken stewed grilled fried except just steamed.The only helpful tip I can offer is order $5 ask for chicken with some skin n get some thick black sauce n chili of costs.I would come back but not at peak hour. There are many other good chicken rice stores through out Singapore so have a good eat throughout
3
Extremely long queues especially lunch hours. Waiting time may take up to half an hour or more. Rice was a bit hard to my taste. Chicken was tender. Overall alright but a bit on the flavourful side, not too much to my personal liking but would be great for those who just likes more flavourful food
4
We ate Tian-Tian chicken rice at Maxwell food court, proceed through MRT Tanjong Pagar then took exit G. You can enjoy at lunch cause the food court don't open at night. The rice is so tasteful, the soup also. Chicken is superb taste..enjoy the lunch with the best chicken rice in Singapor
5
Was so excited to try it out and it didn't disappoint! Best Hainanese chicken I've had. Can't wait to go back!
5
So darn good that I'd travel back for. Went to the one near Bedok and have been to the one at Maxwell's a couple of times. The flavors are consistent and the service no fuss.
3
Not worth your time queuing for chicken rice at this stall. The service is average and the food is also average. It used to be good but that's the past!
5
I have stayed in Singapore for more than 7yrs and tasted chicken rice in dozens of shops, this one is the best one absolutely! Every my friend and family who come to singapore I will treat them this and it never let me down.Shortages, 1. Long long quene lines, and u hv to quene twice! One for casher, another for dishes.2. Headquarters in Maxwell hawker center: Hygiene around eating area is just so so, but right now whole center is under renovation till this Dec, hope we can see a brand new looking after that
4
I love hainese chicken rice and I love Tian Tian's version. However I really don't like to eat it at their Maxwell branch because:1. LONG QUEUEs! - don't even bother coming during lunch time. It's full of office people and you'd be lucky to get a spot if they haven't closed yet. They are that popular. In the evenings it's pretty much the same. Once we were already on queue but just our luck - when our turn came they told us WE ARE CLOSED ALREADY - they've reached their quota for the day. Ended up eating in another stall in Maxwell.2. Maxwell Food Centre - I know its old and the government has renovated it and all - but its still full of little cockroaches crawling in your seats and under the tables, and from the gutters. Not the best place to eat for me.I would rather suggest that you go to Tian Tian's restaurant with airconditioning and serving THE SAME FOOD WITH THE SAME PRICE at their East Coast branch in Joo Chiat Road. Here you can sit down, have decent toilet, and enjoy the same thing you will eat in Maxwell
4
The title says it all. The chicken is flavourful and not tough or dry, like how it can get at some other chicken rice stalls. The sauce drizzled over the chicken is also tasty and fragrant; I love to scoop some of the sauce out and drizzle it over my rice. They go very well. And the best part, the price of a plate of chicken rice is not exorbitant.
4
This restaurant sells Hainanese chicken rice, with a choice of 3 vegetable dishes, and a range of soft drinks. Not very exciting? Well, I prefer a place with a small menu that cooks to perfection rather than one with a wide menu that cannot cook even the basics.The place is very clean and bright, if a little spartan. The staff are pleasant and efficient. The prices are very reasonable.It's hard to criticise the place really.Recommended
5
I know this is a well travelled place, but the chicken was really good enough and live up to the Bourdain hype. I am sure there are other places just as good, but this place is well documented, easy to fine, the the chicken was divine. Probably the most memorable dish we ate in Singapore
5
If you are a fan of Chicken rice, do give this place a try. It has a few branches and the rice and chicken are of better quality as compared to some of the places.The chilly is probably the highlight. If you like sprouts, the cuttlefish and sprouts would be a good be
3
I worked just next door to the food centre yet i dont really bother to queue for this. Its supposed to be one of the best in SG but i only find the chilli nice and hot. The rice and chicken are in small portions and just ok. Nothing to rave about.
5
A must go in Singapore. Tasty chicken, rice with the sauces. Please be noted that all the Tien Tien will be closed in every Monday.
5
We're there every weekend for lunch. An apparently simple meal brought to life with delicious rice, perfect chicken, and the right condiments (love my black sauce!). Friendly staff, but don't park there and shop elsewhere - a vigilant parking warden clamps cars!
4
The chicken is well done and texture is smooth, best with the chilly sauce. Beside chicken they also serve vegetables and other dishes.
4
went there for lunch and the chicken rice was just perfect. had a bit of a queue but worth the wait. will definitely return back!
4
This is the best Chicken Rice in S'pore I have tried. It's very long queue, but no worry, they have very good ordering system and it's fast.
5
Chicken rice is something unique, the steamed white chicken with fragrance oil rice and cucumber.... I love this.
5
I can't really say the dish is heavenly for the rice can be a bit better, but i am astounded by the overall dish of steam chicken rice especially the perfect tenderness of the chicken and the delicious sauce accompanying it. The chili is also pretty good. The bad thing is when I tried to reorder my second plate, they ran out of it :
5
Maxwell Road hawker center is a collection of some of the best food stalls in Singapore. Here you find Tian Tian Chicken Rice Stall. There is always a queue waiting for their orders. The wait is worth it. One chicken was selected on you places your order. The hawker then cut up the chicken skillfully. The pieces are placed artistry on the serving plate. Suggest you order the gizzards, livers and chicken feet too. The rice is just so soft and fragrant. You will need a plate of the famous signature chilly sauce, black sauce and ginger. A bowl of hot chicken broth is given free to you. The chicken is so tender and skin slippery soft. Must eat. Die die must try.
5
Just to add that you don't need to stand in queue for Tian Tian's chicken rice anymore I suppose - we were served right away at the Joo Chiat Branch where, on lunch time, there were still enough empty tables waiting. This branch may be a little more touristy (they offer roasted chicken as well- not traditional and not their strongest dish), but the traditional Hainanese chicken/rice has the same great taste. The service is fast and the place has white wooden tables - so much better for taking there visiting business associates to savor one of the most exceptional dishes of Singapore IMHO
5
Anthony Bourdain wasn't kidding. This is the best food on the island. Everyone knows this stall #10 in the Maxwell Center. Chicken so full of flavor and you see lines and lines of people coming here. The broth! The moiist chicken! The rice! The ginger! The spicy sauces! The dark sauce! It's all here and it costs you probably $4Read this: http://smashgods.com/2010/04/06/the-best-meal-ive-ever-had
5
The rice is fragrant. The chicken is juicy. The chillie sauce has got the perfect balance of salt, sweet and heat.
5
Great stuff! It's the size of the birds they use and the extra care taken to prepare the dish. Awesome!
4
Anthony Bourdain ate here so i decided to come here. My expectation was high due to the show a well as other forums saying that it sells the best hainanese chicken on the island. Actually the chicken is not bad. It's juicy. the queue was long. But it's just not the food that makes me want to come back to this place. Still, it's a must try place
5
It is worth to queue for the chicken rice (my boyfriend's choice) as well as the veggies (me). The orange sauce is indeed as spicy as it looks, so have your beer or other refreshing beverage ready before you try it!Also, reserve a table (by simply putting a tissue pack there) before you order
4
Went there with new friends (German), we were told by our youth hostel (Tree In Lodge) to try it out it was very good. But make sure you go in advance as there was a 30mins waiting line!!! Which tells a lot of the place.. ENJOY I
3
Since it was my first time to visit Singapore, I made a point to research well-talked about food of the said country. In every MUST-TRY list, chicken rice is on the list. And everyone is just raving about this particular stall at Maxwell Food Center -- Tian Tian. Even watch Anthony Bourdain on YoutTube as he enjoyed this famous dish. So I did include this to our itinerary and visited the infamous stall for our lunch. You have to queue to purchase this particular dish. It's definitely selling like hotcakes as people wait for their turn to purchase this favorite Singaporean dish.I cannot actually rate their service as my cousin already got our order when we arrived. She got us one order of the steamed chicken and one order of the roasted chicken. I was so looking forward to eating the dish and knowing what the hype was all about. However, it did not meet my expectation. I find the dish a little bland and the taste a little too familiar. Maybe because I also came from an Asian country that this dish did not have that extra appeal on me. I did finish the dish so it's not bad at all. I would still recommend that you try it though. And pass your own judgement on this favorite Singapore dish
5
Loved, loved, loved Tian Tian. Most of the chicken rice we saw at Hawker food centers was weird chicken parts and meat that didn't look great. This was very flavorful, and good quality chicken. The chili sauce is a must- warning it is spicy. Make sure to find this food stand on your trip! Make sure to go in the line to order first, then you get in a second line to get your food, most people were in the wrong line
4
Went to the Maxwell Food Centre at around 3pm to try Tian Tian Hainanese chicken rice. There was, as expected, no queue. Chicken was served warm; it was tasty and soft. The rice,on the other hand, can be eaten on its own. Typical of hawker centers around Singapore, the place was a bit uncomfortable. I got sweaty after finishing my meal. The stall was easy to find. It is just minutes away from Buddha Tooth Relic Temple & Museum in Chinatown
3
Tian Tian Chicken rice is average according to my taste bud. There are better ones around in any hawker centre or Kopitiam (Hokkien for coffee shop). There is one 2 stalls away from Tian Tian on the left when you face the stall that taste as good. The curry puff beside the stall is also good. Don't know their name. I was not impressed with Tian Tian
3
Many rave about Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice but when I went I found the chicken of average quality. The chicken was fat and cold (like chilled cold) and I felt the rice grain used could have been of a better quality type. Personal preference perhaps.
4
This was recommended by several people as the best chicken rice place in Singapore. They were correct, and you will wait in line because it is very popular with locals. The food is excellent. Choose a variety and share among your group.
3
You have had one you have had them all, it is obvious the teachings of asian cooking was not handed down.
5
My favorite white chicken rice in Singapore. The rice alone is worth the super long queue. A little pricey, but consistently amazingly fragrant.
Do not come near this stall if you're on a diet.
3
It's good chicken rice but the other chicken rice stalls at Maxwell are good too.
4
Chicken Rice is one of my favouriate menus. I really love Chicken Rice in Thailand as well as this restaurant. It is easy to find the food centre. The price is reasonable. Such a yummy Chicken Rice
4
Good rice, good chicken, good chilli. and now in two locations
5
When I first tried it a few year ago I was amazed at how good something as simple as this could be- I could eat bowls of the rice on its own. The chilli sauce is great and the chicken is cooked really well. I go here every time I am in SG- and all for less than AUD2.50 per plate
5
We went to the Maxwell Food Centre mostly for Tian Tian Chicken Rice.It was up to its reputation.Not only the chicken is super good, but the rice is very flavourful. They have their secret way of cooking and I like it.Very affordable for two.Mandatory stop for visitors
5
Chicken rice -- the unofficial national dish of Singapore. The best chicken rice I had in Singapore was here, matter of fact, it's the best I've ever had anywhere. The chicken is very moist and tender and the rice is definitely something special. Looks like a bed of plain white rice, which many other chicken rice stalls give, but it really is not. It's cooked and prepared differently using chicken stock and the difference is definitely in the taste and compliments the chicken perfectly. Really wanted to come back here at least two more times during my time in Singapore, but there is so much other food to try and only a limited amount of room in my stomach. Any future return trips I have to Singapore will include a stop here
5
I found LONG line at this place around 4PM. I wasn't that hungry, but I was so curious, so I joined the line. Glad I did!I had millions of chicken in my life, but eating their chicken rice was something else. SO tender and flavorful. Singaporean chicken rice is very tender, but this place is exceptionally good. I will definitely come back again.
4
Good meal set and great value. The rice is good enough to eat on its own!
4
I love chicken rice and there are many good places for it, but this is a solid very price-competitive place to try the classic Singaporean (OK Hainanese really) dish.
5
Definitely one of the best chicken rice in singapore, not expensive, the queue is long but worth the wait, one of the favorite eating place in singapore
5
Delicious chicken.
Fragrant rice.
Tasty chilli.
Queue can be long but it moves fast.
5
Words cannot describe how scrumptious Tian Tian's chicken rice is...this is definitely a must try! Will definitely change your life!
3
I had better chicken rice elsewhere in Asia. This is way overhyped.
4
Certainly a great dish to introduce S'pore great street cuisine to the world. Diners, from all works of life - locals, office workers, tourists, anyone hungry...throng the food store daily. So be prepare to queue at least 20-30min during peak hours (1130am -130pm) just to taste the stall signature dish. Food Critique - Anthony Bordain raved about it, and so do plenty local and regional food critiques...Be reminded this a self-serve in hawker centre and the ambience is one of street food and can get warm on a sunny day. You can order various dishes like oyster veg, bean sprouts (with or without cuttlefish), chicken intestines, etc to accompany the dish. Your order will be accompany with a bowl of hot chicken soup, chilli and dark soya sauce on the side.Orders are taken and Payment (cash only) are collected when you are near the cashier. Keep the receipt for collection of your order just a few steps down the cashier. Lose that receipt and lose your meal (if you need to order extra rice half way through the meal, just proceed to order wth the cashier and DON'T queue again).For 4 persons - 1 whole chicken is recommend, for 2 person (half)...depending on appetite.One advance: secure a seat first before getting your meal, can be a challenging affair. Do share a table with table with others. It's the best option. Especially during peak hours....Bon appetite ^__^ Like the stall name "Tian Tian Lai" implies, you will want to "Everyday comes" (literally)
3
We travel to Singapore a lot. We go there because of the food mainly. Chicken rice is one of my staple foods while there. After watching the Bordain roadshow where he raved on about the chicken we thought next time we are there and in the area we would give it a try.We arrived at the stall and admired all the Bordain rants and raves plastered on the window and joined the queue. After doing the 30 minute line dance shuffle we finally got our food. The chicken was tasteless and the water or supposed soup tasted, well, like water. It was cheap and nasty. Of course we found a great roast duck place a few doors up and really pigged out. Advice: Dont just go by what what celebrity chefs tell you, look around first. If it catches your eye, it must be good. But then........Hmmm
4
Many things have been written about this famous chicken rice, which can be found humbly tucked away at Maxwell food center in China town. Prices are still quite cheap, it is inside a food hall, so not much atmosphere can be expected. But, you get the usual good taste. The chicken has a most interesting tender texture, sort of melt in the mouth, goes perfectly with the flavored rice. The ginger-chili sauce and sweet soy sauce add the final touch to this special dish. Perfect with a glass of soya bean milk. I think this is a dish any visitors to Singapore must try
5
This place came well reviewed and I can see why. It was very good quality chicken rice and the price very good. I got a large order size at S$3.50 which was ample food for either a lunch or dinner.Service was very quick, from when I ordered to delivery was less than 1 minute. Can't complain about that.The Maxwell Food Centre is a must visit, very few tourists and mostly locals, which always fills me with confidence. So many places to choose from in there but this is a consistent winner.Ross...
4
We went to the one in East Coast and it is very nice!I was not surprised that it was third.The chicken rice there is popular and famous.However,I must say that it is not the best chicken rice
5
Ordered the large portion (non leg part) Rice was perfect, chicken was perfect. Ginger, chilli and Soy also perfect. There was a line of around 10 people, but got served in less than 5 minutes.
5
Bourdain was correct the chicken & rice there is fragrant & tasty, Waited in line for about 10min but it was worth it, Paid $3.50, The chilli side sauce was mmmmmmm.
4
More often than not, long queues await the Chicken Rice lovers. But its all worth it.
Tian Tian is efficient, but there is just such a great demand!
4
My family of 12 went there for a early dinner. Although its quite hard to find the this eating place which is inside a hawker center (local food courts) it was worth it. We arrive there around 6pm and we were the last customer to be given their world famous chicken rice. In fact, we ordered for 3 whole chicken but they only had 1.5 left. As soonas their chicken will be out of stock, they will close down. There are more stores or eating place serving chicken rice besides them but their chicken always runs out first. It was featured in Anthony Bourdian's show - No reservation. The lady was kind enough to give us the rice for free for being the last customer for the day. I've tried many chicken rice in Singapore and I can say that this is the best.My advice to thise who wish to try the best chicken rice in Singapore - go there as early as possible!!
4
Very cheap and very delicious Hainanese Chicken Rice.Before going to Singapore I did my homework and researched the best Hainanese Chicken Rice. It was definitely worth going to. There was a long line but who cares! Price is very reasonable. I also had Hainanese chicken rice to go and they packed it pretty well. Still delicious when we ate it the next day.I will definitely come back here again when I visit Singapore next time
2
We checked out the reviews for eating in Singapore and the Maxwell Food Centre was a must. We lined up for 35 minutes as it was very busy, and ordered the large chicken and rice x 2.(S$3.50each) One plate had a part of breast sliced on top of rice and the other plate had a sickly looking undercooked wing and a bit of breast on the rice. Both had the soup in separate bowls. The flavour was underwhelming and needed every bit of the chilli jam served separately. We discarded the anaemic looking wing and shared the part breast. I am sorry we didn't order from somewhere else, there were plenty of good looking food stalls. Unfortunately, this soured our experience of Singapore Chicken Rice and we didn't try it anywhere else.Overall a very disappointing experience, and we were accosted by a beggar outside who wouldn't leave us alone until we gave him money
3
Finally was able to venture over to the Maxwell Food Court in Singapore. Had to try the Chicken Rice Bourdain swore by. The large plate cost S3.50 and came with the house soup. The flavor was just average, good but not great. I was expecting more flavor since it was so hyped. I have had better Chicken Rice in Singapore and elsewhere. Disappointing after the anticipation from the hype
3
Went to Tian Tian in the Maxwell Food Center although the food was average to good. I had also eaten Hainanese chicken and rice at two other places in the Maxwell Food Center while in Singapore and found them to be just a little bit better. The Tian Tian food stall however was from what I could see probably the largest and one of the cleanest in the market. It also had the longest lines, which usally tanslates into good things usally. I found my chicken to be cold and not as flavorfull as the other two places, (sorry I don't remember the names of the other two place). I would still recommend this restaurant however for a good cheap meal
5
Its amazing how a simple looking dish can be so tasty. Tasty, but not in a sense that its like bursting with heavy flavours from lots of spices that will leave your tongue tingling for a few hours. No. This is a simple dish that is deliciously satisfying for the masses - no frills and straight to the point yum. A perfect light meal for breakfast, lunch, dinner or even as a 'snack'. No wonder its a 'national dish' in many regions. Regular condiments are available to add taste should you want to venture out of simplicity on occasions
4
As said by some other, not sure if its the best, but for me definitely the best i ever had.
next trip to Singapore i will be back really worth?!
5
You can find this place by the line of customers. It is worth the wait! The chicken we had was boneless and delicious. The rice had a great flavor. Be sure to get some of the condiments as well.
2
went to the newly opened branch at Joo Chiat Road and what a disappointment!
operationally it was a mess, chicken was under cooked.service was slow and all over the place.
only saving grace was the place was airconditioned. not returning again!
4
One of my favourite chicken rice!!
5
A HK friend introduced to me Tian Tian and she was raving to me about Anthony Bourdain's review. Now, what does Anthony Bourdain know ANYTHING about local food?Wrong. I have tried Five-Star, Boon Tong Kee, Wee Nam Kee, Pow Sing (yes, I find Chatterbox WAY over-rated)....and if there is ONE chicken rice I'd put on calories for.....it is Tian Tian Chicken Rice. I then introduced this to an American Japanese friend and he was so impressed that he sent me a picture to make my mouth water.Tian Tian just opened a shop in Joo Chiat.....to be honest, the Maxwell Road's Tian Tian is still much better. Eat chicken rice at your peril.... it is VERY FATTENING!
3
We went to this place a couple of times and also tried a couple of other places. This was not the best chicken. Ours was tough, flavorless, and cold. But the rice was so good! Fragrant and yummy, I could eat 4 bowls of that. I'd want to wait in line just to order the rice, but every time I do, I figure I'm in line I should get the chicken, maybe it's better than the last time I had it. And I'd be disappointed.A place across the street in Chinatown is much better, has air-conditioning, sit-down service and of course higher prices. (It's on South Bridge Road, next to the Chinese monastery). Their chicken was warm and with a lot of flavor. Of course, Tian Tian is the true Singapore experience -- eating in a outdoor foodcourt, with other locals. But honestly, not the mind-blowing chicken & rice I'd hope it to be
4
After watching Anthony Bourdain's video in YouTube, we decided to try the famous Hainanese chicken rice at Tian Tian. It's not really a restaurant, but a food stall in Maxwell's Food Centre. It's a nice gastronomic experience though, and a good deal: the large plate is only SGD 3.3. Chicken rice is a very simple Singaporean dish with no frills, consisting of very tender chicken meat with fragrant rice. It's delicious. The plate comes with cucumbers and a bowl of soup. Chili and soy sauce is also provided. The only problem is the long queue, specially during lunch time. It's worth the wait anyway
4
Last weekend I went to Singapore and I decided to go to the restaurant because of the reviews. I must say I was not that impressed but not disappointed either. The restaurant is located at the counter number 10 of the Maxwell food center and there was no A/C there. The wait was about 30 minutes and the food was good but really I have had better chicken rice at a couple of places in Bangkok. At the same time, you can't complain because the price was very cheap... $2.80 for a regular portion and $3.20 for a large portion.I might go there again if I happen to be in the area but definitely I will never take a long cab ride just to have chicken rice there. It was all in all good tasting and great for value but that's just my opinion
5
If you had to eat only one thing in Singapore, eat the Hainanese Chicken Rice at Tian Tian. This dish is not overspiced. The chicken is complex in flavor yet understated, the rice is full bodied yet still fluffy. There were more than 20 food stalls, yet there were about 20 people waiting in line for this dish. There was a camera crew on site filming this place
5
This classic in the Maxwell Food Centre is worth the time and effort to find and wait in line! When I visited here for lunch on a Saturday the line was about 20 minutes long. the Chicken Rice, along with a portion of vegetables with oyster sauce, was outstanding
5
This was so good and a must when you go to Singapore.

Extremely popular and well-known foodstall in Maxwell Food Centre, specializing in Hainan Chicken Rice. We usually do a take-away order by phoning beforehand, to avoid the queue. Hopefully, this does not hold up anyone waiting in line to be served. The Chicken always turns out great and the flagrant Rice is just as tasty. The dish pairs unexpectedly well with a very good White Burgundy

Stumbled onto this place by accident as I saw a line of people waiting to be served when all other food court outlets were deserted. This had to be good I thought so joined the line30 mins later and 2 chicken rice's in hand. I was not left disappointed

During our family trip to Singapore this past X'mas holidays we had the opportunity to visit the famous TianTian Chicken rice stall at the Maxwell Hawker Center in Chinatown. There are two sections in this hawker center. The TianTian chicken rice stall is on left section. You will not miss it as it's the one with the long line. The wait for us actually was not too bad, around 15min. We got half chicken, rice, veggie and soup for total of around SGD20. I must say we were not disappointed with the Hainanese chicken as it was tender, moist and flavorful. The rice was equally tasty, with that chicken fragrance drifting with every bite. The soup and veggie were ok. The only minor negative was that the half chicken portion was rather small, so really not enough meat nor pieces for four of us. Next time we will order the whole chicken instead.Interestingly it seems there is another popular stall at the other section selling porridge as that stall also had a long line too. Will check it out next time

Amid the sea of hawker stalls that make up the Maxwell Road Food Center, one stands out to even the casual observer. It alone has a line/queue. Apparantely Tian Tian has people waiting for its food virtually all the time. I visited during what I thought would be a between-meal lull in foot traffic, around 4PM, and sure enough there were still about 10 people waiting ahead of me. No other stall in the Center had a queue.The reason is obvious after you taste their Chicken Rice. How they infuse so much flavor into the chicken meat from a boiling/steaming cooking process is remarkable. The bowl of clear broth that comes with it has a similar flavor and is quite nice. The "Vegetable with Oyster Sauce" dish that I also ordered was surprising delicious: baby bok choy infused with thse same wonderful flavors found in the chicken. And all of it came to a little over S$6.00 (US$5.00) for food quality that many much more expensive Asian restuarants can't match.[A hint for fellow tourists: hawker stalls like this don't provide napkins, and to use the wash rooms to clean up will cost you ten cents (exact change helps). Also Tian Tian doesn't sells beverages. For something with an Asian flair that's easily accessible to everyone's palate I recommend the sugar cane juice from the stall directly across from Tian Tian]

Tian Tian is a classic. You can know by the snaking long queues that there's something serious happeniing here. Their chicken rice is to die for. Why settle for one plate ? Be a glutton. But hey, visit early...their chicken rice often runs out by 2pm

This is one of the best chicken rice I've ever tasted! The chicken is tender and juicy while the rice is flavorful and can be eaten on its own! I barely used the chili sauce on my chicken because I wanted to savor every bit of its flavor. Highly recommended
