Service was quick, loved the option to put our own order in via an Ipad only down side is there's no option for special requirements (eg - didn't want ice in my drink)
Food came out quick
Overall some good options, would go back

My spouse and I have often visited Fish n Co.. Loved their platter as always. So far I had been to their numerous locations more than 20 times in a family or couple and was always well served and food were always delicious. The last meal we had was a vivo. Got a seafood platter for one (yummy) prawns were super delicious that day. got an add on (clams in butter curry). This one is a bomb. a must have... serving was big and for $6.95 it was superb.... We also got the set lunch of peri2 catch( Grill fish with sambal) Marvellous I can say and add on fried fish skin. Well all this for the both of us... and well yeah we cant finish it up. without having to say, the waitress offered to pack it up for us nicely. Lovely... just superb experience. Keep it up..

The successful Singaporean restaurant opened a branch in Kuwait at Dalal Complex Salmiyah. The restaurant is spacious but empty and only two tables were occupied including ours. The staff are very unprofessional and failed to serve properly despite being almost empty and were taken by the personal chit chat amongst each other. Unfortunately the food in the pan was cooled and needed more heating spoiling the nicely presented plates. Overall not recommende

Fish & Co. is a newly opened Singaporean restaurant in Kuwait city. It is located in Dalal Mall, Salmiya. Fish & Co. serves Seafood in a pan. I had baked salmon lunch. I love seafood. The waiter in charge recommended an Award winning appetizer. Blue Mussels in garlic & lemon butter sauce is the winner. I agreed and I was not disappointed. Fish & Co. has an airy location and with Marina design. The dominant colors are of a sailor’s colors of blue, sky blue and white. Marina elements of timonel and a compass are symbols of navigation. Fish & Co. is opened in 11 locations 9 of the 11 are Asian countries; UAE and Kuwait are new locations on the map. The menu is big with varied choices of seafood suitable for adults and kids. Fish & Co. serves 6 styles of Fish & Chips from around the world. The London Fish & Chips is the original one, the New York Fish & Chips has Parmesan crust, the Danish one has mozzarella, the Bombay one has spices, the Singaporean one had Chili crab sauce and the Swiss Fish & Chips has oregano. The amazing menu includes Pots, platters, Baked rice and Pizza. The drinks list is varied. You have juices, cocktails, mocktails and blends. I had 10 Blue Mussels only for my appetizer; the total order contains 22 mussels. The Mussels were very tasty and well cooked. The garlic lemon sauce was creamy and savory. The Baked salmon with citrus crust (breadcrumbs) is served with boiled vegetables like celery and courgette, prepared with rice & raisins, topped with Mushroom cream sauce. The salmon was soft and well cooked. I love Lychee; hence I had the ever-refreshing Lychee mojito. Today’s lunch was tasty, light and healthy, I will surely go back for the 22 blue mussels and the Nonalcoholic root beer float with vanilla ice cream. Chef Roberto is the man behind the ultimate flavor of Fish & Co.SEE photos for food and interior

Was in town for a 10 day business trip and our local colleagues took us here for lunch. It was easy access from the Harbor Front One Tower via a skywalk. Our table of 8 all enjoyed our lunch specials of fried fish (Best Fish, Bombay Fish, Danish Fish, and Singapore Fish). My colleague and I split two orders so I could taste her Best Fish and she could taste my Danish Fish. While both were good, we both agreed that the Danish Fish was better. The food, prices, and service were all good

We went to F&co as a group of 10. The service by Avi was friendly and efficient, especially as the group arrived over a period of time. The waiting time for the food was acceptable as we had platters and individual dishes. Overall the food was fresh, warm and tasty. Everybody has plenty to eat and the bill at the end was surprisingly lower than expected. It was a good place for a early evening meal and in a convenient location

Fish & Co. may initially strike you as rather expensive and not for the budget-conscious. However, you will discover that the serving sizes are actually for sharing. But price is not the main draw of this resto. It's food quality. If you're looking for fresh seafood cooked in a simple tasty manner, you may want to try its many menu items that revolve around fish and seafood. My first time here, I ordered salad with grilled chicken as starter. Leaves were crisp, fresh. Dressing was light. It was filling by itself. Main dish was salmon with citrus crust. It had baked pumpkin and simple paella as side dishes. The sauce was richer but equally tasty. Both items are highly recommended. Big taste, for sharing

Horrible fish & chips for a fish & chips specialty restaurant.I find it quite humorous really. If you can't live up to your name and type of food you specialize in, you might as well don't do it.I know for a long time they don't serve decent fish & chips but since I'm having a major craving for fish & chips, thought I'll just settle for fish & co. I know they try to innovate and be creative but they can't even serve up a typical fish & chips right! Can you imagine? My craving for typical English / Aussie fish & chips were set out for great disappointment but it's not unexpected just that it tasted far worse than I expected!!The batter was thick, a strong scent of recycled oil and the whole fish disintegrate when I pour vinegar over.By right, vinegar should help the fish & chips stay crispy but no, it disintegrates!!! I went to the one at Seletar Mall. The waitresses there were helpful. Particularly the manager who got me things I requested. I asked for her to bring me white vinegar and she did. Very friendly and helpful. Sadly, the food just isn't palatable. Obviously not a place for 'real' fish & chips and seafood. Note:I almost throw up after removing the stale oil-taste of the batter and when I get to the fish, it's texture taste like its expirin

We used to go to fish and Co everywhere we can find one.Yesterday our experience at Tampines mall was average. The service remained excellent but it seems the kitchen annit take the pressure of busy time.Our fish and fried veggies were not at the standard we used to get...
1
We order a caesar salad at the branch outside sea aquariumCompletely unacceptable standardFor a price of 5,90, wr got 6 salad leaves.No croutons, no bacons, tomato nor any other ingredients? Please ,.. I would rather pay 10 sgd and get a proper salad...I wont go there agai

My family (9pax including baby & toddler) and I were at Fish & Co. Bugis+ and we end up waiting and waiting for our fiod to arrive and still after 40 mins of waiting; not just the adults are hungry but my kids are so hungry. When i approach the staffs they claim that the food are arriving and asked for another two minutes and still preparing the kids meal. I told them that there were a group of 5 people queing up and sat down and the ordered and their food arrived. Even the family next to us started eating and other diners who go their orders later than ours has arrive; yet nothing was serve except two plates of soup, caesar salad, coke, passionfruit drink 4 kids orange juice. That all there is. I can be very patient but its taking way too long. Unfortunately we decided to leave and foot the bill. If they're really good at customer service they should waive the bill and serve the next customer better. Look and compare the time on the receipt. Its really a long wait.Thinking about it, IF Fish & co loves their customers, and provide a gd service they should have not charged me that $20+ salad and a few drinks. Had to part with my hubby's $20 cash voucher and top up in cash on top of that! Its daylight robbery. I thought my family and immediate family could have a good meal but instead we had to wait and wait and felt cheated. Other diners who came after us sat down and was being served. What kind of service is that??!!! Who's going to compensate the time wasted and had no choice to leave (kids hungry & disappointed) had to dine at another restaurant that provide better customer service; and paid $100+ in cash

Very strange but the 3 or 4 times we tried Paragon, the food was very bland. We decided not to go back there. Whereas at 313 Somerset the food (same meals) were excellent! Not sure how this has happened as they LOOK the same, but the flavor just ISN'T THERE with meals served at Paragon.So as a review of the 313 Somerset outlet, it is fantastic. Big portions, family friendly venues. The service is hit and miss though and you have to put your own order into an iPad which is a bit weird. But overall a great experience and very YUMMY

The Fish & Co restaurant which we had visited was on 91 East Coast Road. You get 15% discount if you stay in Santa Grand Hotel East Coast.My 2 friends & I were absolutely famished when we got there. Sensitive to our needs, our food was brought to us pretty quick. Best of all, my dish, the great white fish with ebiko was excellent! I had ordered their coleslaw & grilled pumpkin as side orders. They were absolutely fantastic!!! I was pleasantly surprised. In addition, we had their crispy white bait as appetizer & no regrets there! The fish & chips which my friend had ordered was OK too. The seafood baked rice was a little too sour for my tastebuds though.We wanted to order dessert but their portion was just so big that we could not even have room for dessert! But do go & try them out. They looked so delicious! It was definitely our loss!We're coming back the next time we're in Singapore. That's for sure

Recommended! Along with our friends, we've order a lot! Variety of Pizza, Platters, Pasta, Paella, Fish and Chips, etc.The large platters for 2 are more than generous and offer excellent variety in one meal, king prawn, white fish, squid, scallops and delicious rice as well as chips meant we all enjoyed a little of everything and plenty of our particular favorites. The staff are very attentive, cheerful and eager to please. Fish & Co is well worth a visit. Definitely we will come back
4
We went there for a late lunch and enjoyed our salad and fish & chips very much. The fish was melting in your mouth, but unfortunately, they didn't have cod fish on that day. French fries were thick and delicious, however, the tartar sauce is a bit sweet. The drinks are too sweet (we had virgin lychee mojito and ice tea) and we had to order water to dissolve a bit. The service was casual, but not attentive and on many occasions staff were just chit chatting while you try to get their attention. Good place for a quick bite.
2
The restaurant ran out of cod so I was not able to order my usual Fish and Chips. Then I made the mistake of ordering Pizza in a fish restaurant.I ordered the Fiery Peri Peri Chicken Pizza. Right off the first bite I knew I would not enjoy this meal. The sauce was overloaded with garlic. I mean don't get me wrong. I love garlic but it just killed all the flavors. Secondly, there was hardly any mozzarella cheese on the pizza and sadly, the Peri Peri chicken had been in the freezer, thawed and re heated. It did not taste fresh at all.Overall, I totally recommended not trying this particular Pizza. Steer away folk Steer away. In all fainess, I have to admit my sister in law did like her calamari

i visited the fish and co in paragon. the Q is not that long. as gadget illiterate as me, she helped me order in the ipad. when i received my chicked and peri prawn platter, im so shocked because of the huge serving. prawn is fresh and very tasty. but when i tasted the chicken minus the chili, taste bland. i usually apprepciate if the chicken itself would be tasty. the problem with some resto, they disregard this thing. i hope they will marinate the chicken better. price is reasonable

Visited on 22ndNov2015 with 3 ladies at Somerset 313 branch. Service is good,crew did keep on checking on our needs. Ordered is through ipad n it do have further discount if u ordered drinks with every main course.Food wise,big portion as 3 of us,couldn't finished,the only one that could finished was because she ordered seafood pasta. I tried the Grilled white fish with rice n chips. Really a big potion n is quite yummy. Overall, have a good experience. 4 of us,spend $93+
5
Good spot to have our meal. Not so crowded and food was fast and served hot. Meat was tender and staff is friendly.
4
Nice seafood platter for one. I chose the one with prawns, fish, calamari, chips and their nice rice. Not sure what kind but delicious rice. Friendly staff. Interesting placing order using the Ipad.
5
excellent food quality maintained by the company a near about standard cuisine(not chinese not malay) which proved a good food for us
5
The aroma and flavour of freshly prepared fish and chips, so yummy. It is value for money and the service is superb. Even Shahrukh Khan endorsed. A not to be missed place in your itinerary.
4
I went to the one located in Paragon a couple of times. Each time I ordered the seafood platter which was served in the cooking pot. It consists a combination of jumbo shrimp, clams, mussels and scallops. All were tasted deliciously. It was also reasonably priced. I also tried the same restaurant in Terminal 2 at Changi airport and found the quality there not nearly as good. I definitely recommend it to anyone who likes cajun style seafood
3
I ordered a baked Pollock with mediterranean vegetables (garlic, olives and some chopped tomatoes) and a kid meal of fish fingers with rice (+ milo drink and an ice-cream). The fish fingers were a bit over fried and dry, I can only reviewed my order (have not try their whole range of menu yet)..the baked fish was a little bland and i must admit that i could see a layer of oil at the base of my pan (especially at the base where my fish rested on)..a bit too oily for my liking, The rice was aromatic with the right tad of fluffiness and the coleslaw was surprisingly tasty. A good deal as the restaurant is having a promotion of order 1 main dish and the kids' meal free. Will try other dishes maybe in the near future
5
It is 18 months since I last visited this resaurant and they still serve the best fish and chips not only in Singapore but in the whole of Asia.Perfectly cooked fish in a light crispy batter. You may have to wait for seat but it is well worth the wait.Still with high prices in Singapore now this restaurant is still good value for mone
4
I was in the same restaurant in Kuta, Bali. It was great food in Singapore as well on Bali. Fish is just fantastic; tasty, juicy. Sauce is also great. Only, thing that was not so satisfying was the service time. We had to wait quite a while to get our order. Yes it was crowded thus you had to wait a bit more. However, I think they could have been faster
4
We decided to have some seafood for dinner, so we ended up going to Fish & Co. For starters we had curry clams (tasty), grilled calamari (really delicious). For the main dish, i had chicken and prawn combo with rice and mash potatoes. They restaurant has good fish and chips too but i didn't have it today. Bon appetite!
3
Went for dinner on a weekday. It was not crowded, we were seated after 5 minutes.During the meal, I was actually quite shocked when I saw the service staff sweeping the floor. It happened twice during my meal. :(The seafood platter was served luke warm, disappointed. The prawns did not taste fresh.Luckily the London fish & chips were very good. Hot, fresh and crispy
4
Clementi Mall outlets was less crowded comparing to other outlets and food is really good. Staff were pretty friendly and helpful. would visit again for sure.
4
Yum yum yum. Great fish restaurant. As an aussie expat living in Singapore I am used to fresh fish. These guys don't disappoint. The food is beautiful and well cooked. Staff recognise my husband and I and its little touches like this that make you happy to return again and again. Thoroughly recommend
4
This is our first time at The Glass House in Penang Road, we came for late lunch with 4 people. 3 of us had fish and chips, and their special promotions of fish and mussels with side order of mashed potatoes. The potions was good size and the fish battered was cooked crisper on the outside and moist inside. The waiting staff was friendly and explained their ordering process that I found too complicated by giving us the iPad (it's like going online to order your foods) when you hungry and just want someone to take your order! Overall, the fish and chips is great and recommend this restaurant. 
3
Visited the joint at SEA Sentosa.Disappointed that it was a self service joint.Food portions are smaller, business was poor even during dinner time.Thankfully the food taste the same as their normal restaurants.But will give it a miss. There are too many other food outlets on Sentosa

I went to orchard paragon for dinner.i expect to be serve but i was so shocked by The waitress hack care attitude...Her name is Sammy and she just passed the ipad and ask me to key in the details myself and then just walked away....then i ask myself what is the use of the waitress then and still charge service charge if they do not even bother to serve customers...this is shocking.so i ask e philipino or malay waiter he told me customer can choose whether to ask them serve or to key in so in explain the logic to him if customer do everything by themselves what is the waiter for and he glare at me and gives me a black face...Their food was okary two big dory fish at least better than manhattan fish market only a small dory in a basket... but they really got to brush up on their service and at least smile a bit....customer dont go there to see a sulky face,last but not least the waitress sammy did not pass the ice cream to me but to my other family member.as if avoidance , I think that is so rude of her..
1
The Paragon branch is so much better in service and in food quality. At my first visit to somerset 313 fish n Co at B3 level, it was extremely disappointing. The food prep is poor. Prawn sizes are small. 2nd mains came 35 minutes later. The food standard was just terrible compared to paragon branch where I've eaten many times. I asked the waitress and she said every branch cooks differently and when she brought me the wrong order twice she told me the same. I'm never going back to this place and going to the trusted and tested Paragon Fish n Co which is a few minutes walk up Orchard road.
5
i so love the salmon with a black sesame seeds,it almost melt into my mouth and it doesn't smell fishy at all. Everytime i think about my dinner lastnight,i am salivating that i promised to myself i have to come back to that place again. The ambience inside the restaurant was really nice,staff are nice and the service was really quick
4
If you're looking for a relatively moderate Sea food price in expensive Singapore, then go for the fish and Co. and you won't regret it. We had a platter for 2 persons including 12 Jumbo Shrimps, Soup, Paella, fries, A fried fish, 1/3 KG of Friend Calimari all topped with tasty lemon butter sauce PLUS 3 Pepsi topped with Vanilla Ice cream PLUS 2 mushroom soups all for round 60 USD wich is good in expensive Singapore
3
We ordered the best Fish and Chips in the world from the menu. Fish was soft, almost mushy. Not good at all - chips were fine though. EntrÃ©e of squid was very good. Service quick and efficient. Lot of people dining here this night so maybe we ordered the wrong item
4
Welcomed by a friendly staff and attended by other friendly staff, too. Paid attention to details, even replacing our plates for shells from the food without being asked. Nice quantity and food. The only complain I have the table for 2 rather small to have so many things placed on it. Love the magazine like menus. It was nice for the staff to check if everything was ok. That little effort did make the dining experience pleasant
1
Went there with my friends. Wanted to introduce them a local restaurant that served good fish.
But disappointed, fish was not fully cooked and the chef choose not to change a new set but re-cook the leftover fish.
Such a disgrace to their brand.
4
went to the new branch at Clementi Mall, was not disappointed.
Staff was attentive and food was served hot.
Standard expected and maintained.
Must try!
4
Nicest fish and chips ever. Also other exciting sea food options. A chain restaurant that you find around Singapore.
5
Every time we go to Fish & Co it is for the mussels, although we do eat the other dishes (I also love the scallops) it is the mussels that keep bring us back each time.The staff have always gone above and beyond as well, all we can say is we are coming back again, and again and again
5
Went to the glass house at park mall for dinner with my gf. we ordered the seafood platter for two. you can't go wrong with this dish when it is a dinner for two. live band started at around 7.30pm. however, the live band could get kinda loud.overall, we are very satisfied with the dining experience
3
Went to the outlet at Glass House. After not patronising them for a long time, I was surprised to find a few changes. Firstly, they are using an iPad to take orders but they still give you the physical menu which I think it is a waste of resources. The servers have to return to the table to collect the iPad and the menu after some time. Secondly, the food came within 10 minutes which I felt was quite reasonable. However, the food was not hot at all which made me think that the food was left unattended for quite some time before it was served to us. Thirdly, sauces were served together with the food in the past. However, during my visit, there was no attempt by the servers to ask whether any sauces were needed which I think is quite bad on the part of the servers. To sum up, Fish n Co could do better in their quality of food and their management of resources.
5
I was missing eating fish and chips as I live abroad and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the dish: batter is very light, the fish is moist and the chips are crispy outside and soft inside. The waiters were very polite and helpful. To be fair the first one was not that smily but she warmed up to me. They gave an extra delicious butter lemon sauce serving without me asking.I shall definitely go back
2
I said I wouldnt visit this restaurant at Tampines again after I was served something that had the texture of swordfish collar rather than the cod that I ordered tho the service then was pretty good. This time, my son and I came before noon and the place was relatively empty. Staff at reception looked up. I indicated table for 2 and she muttered stg which I didn't catch and took off. Thinking she would lead us to a table, we followed but itwas not to be as she proceeded to walk all over the restaurant. Another staff, I presume was a waiter then came out from the kitchen and grabbed a set of menu before proceeding to take us to a table muttering about the soup of the day. Again no smile and no greeting.After seating, he disappeared. We decided on our orders and proceeded to hail a waitress who was looking our way. A sign of recognition of our presence showed on her face but no smile or acknowledgement as she went on to another table. Eventually caught the eye of the same waiter who lead us to the table and completed our orders. He said food will take some 25 mins cos some equipment were out of order. A redeeming point was the waitress who delivered our orders, not the same one we tried to hail earlier. She smiled, greeted us, was polite and hoped we enjoyed our meal. That might get me to return
5
Fish & Co are the best fish and chips outside the UK. I have also been to fish & co in Jakarta, Indonesia and you get the same good food.Nice cooked fish in a beautiful crispy batter. This comes served in a frying pan with real chips. I grew up in the UK and went to many fish and chip shops and Fish & Co is like home from home
4
I went there with my friend cus we want some fish and chips. We went to 313 Somerset branch. At the time we went, there was only one table dining (it was 12:00 pm already). The atmosphere was so so. There was no any decoration that caught my attention. There was no services fr waiter/waitress since we needed to order food fr tablet. we ordered Swizz one and the originl one. The fish is very fresh and the fries is quite nice. It came in very big portion so we were very full. If I want to eat fish and chips again, I will definitely visit this place
3
Dropped by for dinner and was somewhat satisfied afterwards. Being from Boston, westernized seafood in Asia just doesn't cut it. We ordered one of the pan dishes which was incredibly hot so that was good, and we also ordered the fish and chips, which was also decent, just nothing amazing. DO NOT order the mushroom soup top up option as it is bland and not tasty at all. Most likely will not be going back.
3
It must have been at least 2 years since I last ate at Fish & Co. This time, I visited the Park Mall branch for dinner with a friend prior to a concert. Good 'new' menu with loads of options, most of them decently priced. Chose the bouillabaise - err...reasonably tasty but wasn't exactly what I expected of the traditional French seafood soup but I guess it was just the restaurant's version of it. Look for a table as far in as possible. We got a table that was just too close to the entrance - affected the atmosphere quite a bit as there was a constant flow of guests walking to and fro behind me. Service wasn't great, took a long time to attract the waiting staff's attention and for the food to arrive but to be fair, they did look under-staffed that night
4
Three family members decided to have lunch at Fish & Company, location was in tje basement of Paragon, Orchard Road. The seating is informal and our waiter introduced us with the daily specials. We decided on pasta and shrimp, fish and Chips Singapore style and Fried squid. All the dishes were tasty and quantity was big. However, we did not enjoy the fried squid. It was very deep fried and filled with a tasteless cheese sauce. Prices are reasonable but I wish they had free refills on drinks.Overall, a goid expeience. Next time I will order the fried calamari.For those who care, all Fish & Company restsurants are 'Halal Certified.

We visited Fish & Co restaurant at Tampines 1 Mall last Thursday and was terribly disappointed with the Seafood Food platter served at our table. Except for the freshly prepared French fries, all the seafood in the pan (Mussels, Prawns, Calamares, Fish cutlet and rice) felt just lukewarm and appears that the food was pre-cooked earlier on and placed in a room temperature (cold) serving pan. We waited almost 20 to 30 minutes for our food to be served and did not expect such a horrid cold meal at the table. Despite our complaint to the duty head staff at this Fish & Co outlet that SEAFOOD IN THE PAN WAS NOT EVEN WARM AT ALL, the food was send back to the kitchen but returned slightly warmer. Apparently, they microwaved the same dish briefly and returned it back to our table within 5 minutes waiting time. We have dined at several other Fish & Co outlets around Singapore, but have never come across such a bad dining experience as this outlet at Tampines 1 Mall. I think we will steer clear of any Fish & Co restaurants from now on
1
Seriously they should shut it out....high prices for lousy food. Visited it for the first time this weekend and have made my mind never to visit again...ever. They absolutely have no flavor in the food and portions are way too small for the prices they want to charge.Worst was at the entrance they had a staff taking the order who was absolutely reluctant to open his mouth and answer us for questions like which type of fish is used and all.Some how this left a very negative impression on us and we were clueless about this coldness. Again the same happened when we were ordering the drinks but thankfully they turned out to be decent .Immediately after paying our bill we came out and ate at some other place because portions were really small.And not to forget the food was cold when it came.So please dont waste your time and money for this place at least.I am not returning even if they sell free food
5
Ate at the glass house Fish and Co on Penang Road. Service was the best I have experienced in Singapore. Really friendly waitress showed us how to self order via an iPad and took our Childs order. The experience of ordering via the iPad was great. Food arrived quickly and was very good. We had a mixture of baked dishes and Fish and Chips. The baked dishes were exceptionally good, and the Fish and Chips where very good by Singapore standards. Great live music and general ambience
2
Everything was done well this evening. Service was good and prompt even though restaurant was full. Kids were given jigsaw puzzles & lovely bookmarks plus kids' dining ware in girly colors. I was so ready for a good evening. Sadly, all this got cancelled out when the food came. I ordered what was called 'The Best Fish & Chips in Town' was anything but! What is 'white fish' turned out to be the cheapo Sutchi/Catfish which integrated the minute I cut it. I was charged $16.75 for this dish - could have bought me a fab dish across the hall at Ichiban-Boshi where I could expect good and fresh fish!The rating of 2 is for the great effort in everything else in this restaurant. Unfortunately, that's not what you are there for in a restaurant. Good food is still the order of the day, guys, get that right

Arriving at Changi Airport we needed to find somewhere to have dinner and came across Fish & Co. Having our luggage on a trolley with us proved no difficulty as they have an area for trolleys. Shown to a table by a very happy waitress, given a menu - too many choices for weary travellers. Decided on altantic salmon and grilled barrumundi, both good choices very enjoyable, both dishes cooked perfectly, Finished with coffe for 2. Bill came to S$51.00 which we thought was very reasonable and would certainly recommend this restaurant to anyone passing through Changi Airport
1
We went to F.I.S.H @ 313 Somerset.... As it was by Fish & Co, we thought the food would be of similar standard.... How terribly wrong we were!The altantic cod fillet I ordered was rubbery and hard, the worst I had ever eaten in a restaurant..... most of it was left on my plate....Even the salmon my friend had was way overcooked, making it very dry.....The service was really terrible.... One of my friends and I ordered a Chocolate eXXXstasy each...... The waiter didn't bother to inform us that it was a gigantic mug! We will have only ordered one if we had known.... The menu also didn't state that it was much bigger than normal....When the first mug arrived, we tried to cancel the 2nd order but was rejected! The worst thing, the drink fell way short of expectations... it looked nothing like what was shown on the menu.... The picture shown was of a dark colour chocolate drink.... whereas the real drink was more like watered down milo drink....even Meiji chocolate milk tasted much more delicious than it...We felt really cheated! To top it off, my friend had diarrhea later that night....I will never go back to this place again and definitely not recommend it to anyone...
3
Visited F.I.S.H by Fish & Co @ 313 Somerset for lunch with 2 friends.We ordered 2 starters for sharing - crispy silver fish and stuffed squid. The portion especially for the crispy silver fish seemed to be very little (not enough for one person). The stuffed squid is towards the bland side although it was drizzled generously with a thick cream sauce.The main courses that we ordered looked unappetizing and not presented tastefully. The pictures on the menu looked more appealing. The range of prices are reasonable
5
Place to try put seafood in a variety of styles and fashion. Great service and excellent food choice.
3
I think the portion is a lot and it's also a bit on the expensive side. Nevertheless, I would buy platters for sharing as eating too much fried food gets boring and oily.
2
The food was horrible, I did not enjoy it one bit and will not return.. I have certain expectations when it comes to sea food restraints and unfortunately those expectations were not met.
3
It used to be good, but recently the standard dropped. Price is also not as competitive as Manhattan's Fish Market. About $3 to $4 difference just for the basic fish and chips.
4
We like the way the fish options. After eating red meat dinners, we need the fish option, and this came as the natural choice.
The location is easy to get to. The fav'd Fish & Chips (with Vineger!) is the de facto choice.
3
Paid quite a lot of money ($50+ for 4 people) for child-like food. I ordered a dish that had a small fried fish plate along with undercooked bland rice. Not Recommended.
1
I don't usually like to write negative reviews, but this place is so bad it warrants one! We are a family of five and were shown to a table that normally sits four. To accommodate us an extra chair was added to the end of the table (in the walkway) but no extra cutlery or place mat was given (bad start). After about 15 minutes our order was finally taken. A garden salad, that we ordered to have WITH the meal, was incorrectly delivered in the form of a Ceaser Salad. All five mains were delivered (looking nothing like the photos in the menu). My daughter ordered mussels which were delivered almost cold and which were promptly sent back. Our "starter" of crispy fried white bait was delivered 10 minutes AFTER all the mains had been delivered and were cold?? We had to ask three times for my youngest child's dessert and eventually gave up trying and just asked for the bill. The staff were young and obviously in-experienced with no sense of customer service or urgency. The food in itself was also very bland, most were already going cold (in the case of the mussels just not cooked/heated up properly) and so very over priced. We also noticed that the family next to us was also missing a meal for their child after half an hour of the adults receiving their meals! We felt very "ripped off" after paying a small fortune for this rubbish. Don't bother going here - there are so many good restaurants and hawker stalls in Singapore to enjoy

Click : http://www.dairycream.blogspot.sg/2013/04/fish-co-brand-new-menu.html for full Review and PicturesAfter dining at Fish & Co several times, I am delighted to learn about their revamped menu with new tasty dishes. The menu has become a stylish magazine with a 50s retro feel. The choice of light blue colour scheme also effectively highlighted its nautical theme.Clams with Curry Butter $11.95--The use of butter in this dish produced a smooth and creamy texture which makes it a perfect dip for the focaccia bread served alongside. The curry is mildly sweet and won't leave your tongue burning.Another new addition is the Soft Shell Crab Salad($11.95), a giant deep-fried crab with beautiful sweet flavours. Be sure to dig in quickly before the dish gets soggy.For a place that is renowned for seafood, I did not expect the Black Pepper Chicken Baked Rice ($13.95) to be so flavourful. Each mouthful of rice grains is moist and peppery, balanced with sweetness from the luscious caramelised onions. Be sure to scrape the burnt bits of cheese like what I did. Simply spectacular and addictive!visit: www.dairycream.blogspot.sg for full pos

Fresh fish is one of my favourite meals,so this looked a good bet. However the battered fish portion was small and must have been 80% batter. The small fish filet species contained within could not be identified by the waiter and it looked like it had been just defrosted. I asked for tap water, initially they had run out of glasses, then the water was from the hot tap! Staff were friendly but where was the local fish

We thought we would try a meal here during a visit to Singapore but I came away disappointed. We both ordered Cajun Salmon. You get a choice of sides - I got mixed vegetables and mashed potatoes while mum ordered the vegetables and rice. The salmon was cooked to my liking (not too rare which I prefer) but the spices were a bit disappointing. I expected a bit more flavour. A lemon or lime wedge on the side would've gone down well but we didn't get one. The "mixed" vegetables consisted of huge chunks of carrot and an unidentifiable white vegetable - boiled. Very unappetizing. The mashed potato tasted like that instant just-add-hot-water stuff with a dollop of cheesy sauce on top. Mum's rice was bland when it looked like it should've been tasty. The menu is extensive... overwhelming actually. They need to cut back on their menu and focus on creating a handful of really tasty seafood dishes. Then maybe their reviews would be better
3
Read nice reviews so we tried it. I though it was a bit pricey and tasted greasy. Nothing special; didn't leave me with desire to return though nothing overtly bad.
4
The Grilled Salmon n Swordtail fish collar is a MUST try(but not always available)
Will go eat there if we happened to be at Jurong Point shopping
Worth a visit !
4
What can I say about a seafood joint? Order one platter first cause servings will surprise you (unless you're hefty, then it's alright). Calamari is always a good thing here.
3
Service here is hit and miss. Really like the fish it tastes great but you have to be constantly following up on your order to make sure they haven't forgotten something!
3
this is one of those theme restaurants but basically fish and chips with some other seafood based pasta on the menu. not bad for the price but flavors not too sophisticated. perfect for the kids.
3
While I like the idea of a good fish restaurant in Singapore remember this is a chain restaurant so do not expect too much and you wont be disappointed.Service is polite but the food is bland and tasteless which given the options they have at their disposal is disappointing

I love fish and we had dined at Co Fish &Co in 2008 on recommendation, on that occasion our visit coincided with the company's 10th anniversary . It was excellent then and we found it to be equally outstanding on this visit. It is chain whose quality and blend of tastes make it one of our favourite eateries. The large platters for 2 are more than generous and offer excellent variety in one meal, king prawn, white fish, squid, scallops and delicious rice as well as chips meant we both enjoyed a little of everything and plenty of our particular favourites. The staff are very attentive, cheerful and eager to please. We enjoyed fish & co very much, on a second visiting I had the whole seabass which was delicious and my husband had one of the several fish & chips options and commended that also. If you like sea food and want casual dining in a good chain restaurant Fish & Co is well worth a visit
3
Many items on the menu to choose from. Food is good, service staff is attentive to provide extra sauce without asking. Remember to check your bill before payment. One of our item was billed as SGD42.00 instead of SGD39.00. However, they were quick to rectify when pointed out. Overall pleasant experience
1
We waited to be served and although the waiter signalized a few times that he would come, he didn't. In the end someone came down to tell us that we had to move because later that area would be sanitized with unhealthy chemicals (?). So we moved and wanted to order at the uninterested waiter. 3 things of the menu were not available and there was no alternative (us: "Have you got another salad with fish then?" reply: "No, you have to pick something else from the menu"). When the food was brought we got a plate of fries. After 5 minutes (and after we ate of it), another waiter came to pick it up ("Sorry, this is not for you") and put it on the table next to us with other guests.
3
had diner meal here for 2nd time and wasnt the same. Is over 18months since was here before and had meal. Late evening meal this time and service poor. Found waiter taking order was confused with our selection. Took a while for actual meals turned up and not what was ordered. Out of three meals only one right and eaten. Other 2 not totally consumed with more than half left over
1
The locals love this place and I made the mistake of agreeing to join some friends here. food was not good.
wont go again.
2
been there several times with friends but never quite impressed especially when fish is their staple but most often i find their fish overcooked, limp or simply too greasy. it's a good hangout place that is affordable, for the young adult crowd.
4
The only thing that made me come back every time would be the seafood platter. And the mussels in lemon butter sauce.
4
For those who is Fish lover, please do not miss the F&C here. The fish and Chip was the best. You can fill your mouth with the Crispy and juicy fresh fish meat. There will have some surprised when you first taste....experience yourself here and you sure will like it. :

Had lunch with my family at Fish & Co. restaurant in Changi airport. Fish & chips were really great. However, we were not pleased with the service. The pretty girl with long hair was very accommodating and friendly and served us with a smile but the kinda overweight girl seemed pissed to serve us. Like she was not interested to work at all. Even making certain comments to prove herself right, (because she was not listening and when we had to repeat because she did not get it the first time, she made a remark that made us even feel bitter about her) I think she should just find another job that could make her happy. Restaurants are affected by the poor service of the restaurant staff. Train your staff well and get feedbacks from customers
5
If you like Fish & Chips, this is the place to go. Love the Fish & Chips here. The Newyorker Fish & Chips, Philadelphia Fish and Chips and Best Fish & Chips in Town are one of my favs. A must try when in Singapore. Located at Paragong Mall Basemen

Found Fish & Co by accident, looking for another restauurant. We ate here twice during our week in Singapore and had grilled fish both times. The fish was very fresh, nicely presented in an individual frypan with steamed vegies and chips. We really enjoyed both meals. This is a buzzy place, with reasonably priced fresh food. No problem just having water with our meal. We didnt feel hurried through our meal. We are fussy about restaurants and really liked this one and recommend it
5
Service and food is awesome. You can ask for more side dish without extra charge. The staff were very friendly. The manager ensures that everybody gets a drink (water is the minimum and the sky juice is free, of course). He would tell his crew to ask the customer again if you require drink should he spot that there's no drinks on your table
2
This place is designed to get you in the door, ram food and a drink down your throat and get you the hell out as quickly as possible. Reasonable price and an interesting menu but I like to enjoy my meal and be treated politely. I don't go here anymore (Parkway Parade)
3
I used to feel the Fish & Chips here are very nice. Now still nice but i feel old time better. As for other dishes, I think just average. The soup like cooked instantly, which suppose shoudn't be the case. They have seafood platter but sometime I did feel the prawn not very fresh. So if I go there now, I will just get the original Fish & Chips. The simple the best.They had increase the price, so quite pricey to have the quality that I can get else where which is cheaper
3
Nothing spectacular, but good for fish lovers in a comfortable place. Prices quite reasonable.
1
can do better.
Average mcdonalds - for- fish kind of place.
avoid.
3
variety of fish offered was less than satisfactory. Dory fish seems to dominate the menu. not my healthy choice. the quantity though was quite pleasing
2
Was good when they first open at Novena Square. But lately the quality seems to have taken a dive. The food don't taste (and smell) all that fresh and sometimes the shrimp and mussels get over-cooked.
4
I may not have visited every Fish & Co outlet but the ones I've been had staff that were enthusiastic and energetic and made you feel welcome and taken care of. Birthday folks there get treated to a cool song from the crew too!
4
For their prices, the food is good and portions are big. Nothing to complain about.
5
The best fish and chips I've had in a quite a while! I so liked the food that I went there again for dinner on the same day, this time they gave us an iPad to order the food.
2
I had my valentine's meal with my wife in this restaurant, the soup was just average, but the main course was disappointed! the fish tasteless, maybe they forgot to add salt is it? I can understand that chained restaurants always have their central kitchen to standardized the food quality, but the outlet staffs ruined my dining mood by served me a plate of seafood (which inculded tomato based mussels, two pcs deep fried battered fish and some rubbery squids!) with room temperature instead of served it hot. I just paid after meal and never made a complaint, but with only 1 time visit! I'm a hotel cook and I'm really angry with their services and quality of food, they never check before they serve? Valentine's Day always busy but this is not an excuse
3
Maybe we went on the wrong dat. The mocktails we wanted werent available. The oven wasnt working so we couldnt get the pizza we wanted. We did get a fish and rice dish that was good. We ordered drinks that were available. And the quantity of everything was huge. So was the price. We were in for a shock when the bill came. Otherwise, the place has a huge menu and many interesting things can be tried there. Just do look at the price first !
2
We went Fish and Co, dozens of times. We recently visited their Sembawang outlet. Staff - food and preparation - all took a dive. We missed the sparkling environment at Fish and Co. Our last two visits were dissapointing, this one confirms the negative trend. i hope they can turn it around back to pre-crisis levels
4
Always enjoy our Fish & Co. dining experience. Always fresh, tasty and good service
3
oily fish literally. tried it once or twice. a lot of fried stuff. not exceptional.
1
The seafood is not fresh, I've got tummy ache and diarrhea twice; have stopped going there.
4
Loved the Seafood platter and the serving size which can feed 2.
2
dory was served mashed up under the fried coating. I found bones in my fish. Not that all fishes have no bone, but I'd expect my fillet to be treated. If I'd want a bone in my fish, I'd go to a Chinese restaurant.
4
I like their staff as they smile & strive to make your dining experience a pleasant one, like the waiter at Changi Airport who offered us some fries on the house while we waited -a long time though- for our food.
1
What went wrong - prices went up and and up and the value is just not there - Manhattan is a 100% better choice - sorry but true
1
I still have yet to understand how this place manages to stay in business - all they serve is fried food, and sometimes the oil hasn't been changed - you can tell by the way the item is fried. Plus the service is non-existent. Each outlet I've been to has that hanging odor of old oil, which puts any diner off. I guess the people that go there have a cold or major sinus problems
2
The fish and chips have different kinds of cheeses in the batter and it's the only nice part about them. For most part, the fish tends to be dry. Much prefer beer-batter fish and chips served elsewhere. Don't bother with the rest of the menu. Best of the lot: Danish fish and chips. With mozarella cheese
4
Discovered this restaurant in the ION Orchard shopping centre, on Orchard Road.Its basic premise, as the name suggests is fish related dishes.We started with a plate of shared nachos (SGD$7.95), which were passable but not outstanding.For the mains we chose the seafood plate for two (SGD$39.95). This was presented in a large pan and contained far more than we expected. Ten large tiger prawns, mussels, squid rings and 2 pieces of snapper. This was served on a bed of cous cous and came with a side of chips (French fries). We left a little, in part due to the food cooling off by the end of the meal. Good value and we would order it again.The restaurant appeared not to serve alcohol, so we opted for juices (SGD$4)10% service charge was added to final bill
4
food is tasty and leaves you wanting more. not exactly cheap grub, but value for money.
4
I love their appetizers and their selection of fish and chips are good. Service staff are wonderful and I love the mints after dinner. Price of food is reasonable.
3
The servings are usually too large for Asian appetites that it is best for 3 people to share 2 dishes.
5
Many wide variety of fish menu- fried or grill, american, japanese or local style. Fulfil everyone appetite. My fav dining place when I crave for fish
5
seafood platter feast = ichi ban! Very near our hotel (YMCA/Orchard road)
4
The food was very good and the price was good. I do recommend this restaurant for Fish and Chips lovers.
4
I love the Fish & Chips and the Calamari! Now can get for $1 with voucher from www.fish-co.com/earthhour
3
V hearty fish n chips
4
Above average. The calamari is quite nice though.

it has been some time since my friends and i visited fish & co. having last patronised manhattan fish market.. a supposed similar rival to fish & co, we decided to check out whats new @ fish & co. there was an option to top up $5.90 to any main course dish. this allows you to choose from a list of 5 (mini) add-on dishes. i do not recall all the dishes but the few were white baits, scallops and swordfish (?). we decided to pass on this option, thinking.... it was not worth the price for a small quantity. seafood platter for 2 or seafood feast? we went for the latter. $59.90. 10 bucks more than the former but, since we were there to try out the new items, we went for the feast. what did we get? the awesome rice... fries, fish, calamari, prawns, 2 king prawns, mussels, 5 scallops. well....... for $59.90.... im not complaining. every item that we had in that meal was awesome. just the way we like it and just the way we remember it to be..... that made us continually go back for more!the staff at the paragon outlet where we visited were also friendly and polite. added to the great meal that we had. service was prompt. less the 'still dirty' plates that we received. there were stain sauce marks remaining on the edges of the plates....... which was certainly unacceptable. in our opinion at least. we did not make much of a fuss as the plates were duly changed for us when we requested. would i be back at fish & co paragon? certainly! :

Seafood Platter For 1:My favourite dish for the day!
