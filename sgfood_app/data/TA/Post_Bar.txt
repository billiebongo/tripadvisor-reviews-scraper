Nice bar in historic building, appropriately themed drinks and tidbits with local flavor and twist. We had a good time with great service, good music, and delicious Post-themed cocktail drinks.

During our stay in Singapore we decided to go for a drink at the Post Bar in the Fullerton Hotel. We arrived at 11:20 PM and instead of a warm welcome we have been informed that the lady, who welcomed us, need to check if we can still have a drink. A few minutes later we learned that we can have a last drink as the bar is closing at 12. Why can I have only 1 drink if the bar closes in 40 minutes ?!During our whole stay we didn’t feel welcome at all. I believe the other customers felt similar especially as they where refused a last drink at 11:40 pm.That’s definitely not the kind of service you expect in this type of bar

I would have liked to try it, but they wouldn't let us in, even though we were guests at the hotel. We did have a voucher for a free cocktail, but I don't know what it tasted like because it was booked for a private function

Great CBD location. Beers are cold, and the wine selection is decent. Cocktails are hit-and-misses: for example, mojitos are 90% ice, margaritas are not cold enough, and negronis taste somewhere between an Americano and a ‘real’ negroni. Some of the waiting staff (in particular the female ones) are too stressed - never smiling, sometimes exhibiting a cavalier, almost brusque attitude

We reached around 7 pm in the evening..it was bit busy evening but get a table in 5 min ..service is good as expected..they have happy hour but the menu for the happy hour is limited ...the popcorn which they give complimentary was really good ..one must try it .. we had booked dinner in other restaurant of the hotel so we need to go after couple of rounds of drinks ..over all it was a good evening..will love to come back again In future .

Not a good start when they didn't seem to have my reservation on record. But the place was quite empty (to be fair, it was a Thursday night) so we found a table. But while the wood accents in the interior are nice, the whole place just seemed very sparse, not ideal if you're looking to chill. And the music was really poor. Still, all that could maybe still be excused if the drinks were good. But our cocktails were poor. The mojito had an overpowering cucumber taste; the gimlet was bland; and my rum swizzle (which they had to Google to mix) came out as fruit punch. It didn't seem like there was a dedicated bartender there, just staff who could mix the drinks on a sadly limited, staid cocktail menu. We left quickly after one round, and found a much nicer bar a few minutes' walk away at the Landing Point.

Beautiful setting featuring great Happy Hour discounts (signature drinks for 15S$ and 1:1 on well drinks, beer, and two house wines). Cocktails were expertly crafted - we would give especially high marks to the proper Moscow Mule and the unique Singapore Sling (which was not cloying, and featured a healthy garnish of thyme to balance the mild sweetness). Complimentary bar snacks included a yummy garlic popcorn and a flatbread that was a cross between roti/papadums). Staff was attentive, efficient, and had a great sense of humor. Will definitely return

Went here to meet a friend on his recommendation. Called the Post Bar as it has a British red Post Box in the entrance, it's roomy, not too dark with some good background music. The seating is great - comfy or high stools and the staff, including DOS, were really friendly and helpful. Food and drinks were nice if expensive. Well recommended

I can easily call this bar a "luxury bar". But I did not really understand why would cover charge be applicable for wine, which taste like it's decayed? In this case, wine should not be under coupon drink at all.Outside you can purchase one glass of wine for $9 which would be much more pleasant to drink. $20 is just too much for non-quality

Nice ambience Service goodNice truffled popcornsNot impressed why champagne has no HH rate. You are forced to take only house wine at HH which is not impressive. National gallery bars all have HH rate for champagne. If you serve HH for wine you should hv for champagne or at least prosecco otherwise dun serve HH at all otherwise it makes de bar look cheap.
5
Ambience was warm and absolutely love their bar snack - popcorn. Service staff were attentive and friendly.
3
Handy bar if you are staying at the Fullerton
No particularly good aspect and needs an acoustic consultant
And they know how to charge
But the beer was cold and the service was good

Decided to have a nightcap with a visiting friend at this bar. Irish Coffee. Came with a delicious slice of kek lapis. Very friendly service from the Romanian lady.
5
Amazing cocktails in the bar set within the Fullerton Hotel. Great location with fantastic service. Lovely atmosphere.
4
Had drinks with colleagues here after work. Drinks are nice and the finger food too, esp. the chicken bites and mini burgers. A good place to chill out after work.
5
Very friendly and knowledgeable bar staff. Vast amount of cocktails or let the barmen surprise you with their own mixtures.
2
We gave this place a second chance. The staff were attentive and engaging but the cocktails fall short every time. Free popcorn and papadums -though appreciated, were wildly over seasoned. This is the last time for us.
5
I asked my husband to take me for a Singapore sling on my birthday. After Raffles, I came here. It was a new take on the old classic served with crisps and popcorn. It was fantastic so we had two!
5
Any bar that serves Ruinart Blanc de Blanc by the glass is alright by me! A fun, pretty casual bar in the lobby of the gorgeous Fullerton Hotel - a good place to rest and hydrate after some walking around down town Singapore
5
We loved the fact that we were greeted with a rose and a beautifully decorated table ( being that it was Valentine's Day ). The service was good - authorities th we had to wait slightly longer, but the staff made sure that we were well taken care off. Food was delicious and just made the right way. We've always enjoyed food at the Fullerton and will definitely visit again.

Drinks served are nice and ambience is nice. Hotline was efficient and helpful.
However, service on site wasn't exactly great. Staff wasn't attentive and hard to find. And drinks orders are forgotten too.

We were at the Fullerton Post Bar during an afternoon Tango Milonga on Chinese New Year. The experience was really enjoyable (we both are Tango dancers) and the staff very attentive. The setting is pleasant.
4
Located inside the Fullerton Hotel & the home to a working post box this is a a great pit stop when walking the Singapore River. Service for cocktails can be a little slow. Complimentary truffle popcorn is delicious.
4
We went for drinks and were nicely welcomed. Big smoking area outside and happy hour till midnight. We were sitting in the garden area.

Very nice Japanese buffet but the choice is very limited. The waitress brought more food to the table but the food that was there was great. Overpriced for what you get

I love the Fullerton hotel, it looks great and service is great. But what have they done to their bar? The Post Bar used to be a great place to hang out, grab a couple of drinks and unwind. It's not that the service is poor or unfriendly - but the atmosphere is dead. Totally bland, and the place could do with a freshening up. Also probably the most expensive beer I've bought in Singapore and surprisingly more expensive than dinner.Please make this bar more attractive and hopefully the crowds will be back

I remember I was here when the hotel first opened in 2001, and now, after at least 15 years, it still has a cool vibe. We all had The Merlion (SGD21/GBP12/USD15 per glass), a vibrantly coloured drink of Tequila, grenadine syrup, lime juice, cane syrup, ginger juice and egg white (or so the menu says). It's a tad sweet and can be served as a non-alcoholic drink too. We had truffle-infused popcorn and spiced parpadum (a crispy wafer-like Indian snack) and actually preferred the latter, which was surprisingly tastier.

The Fullerton Hotel was until 1995 the General Post Office in Singapore. Since its transformation to hotel, the bar takes its name from the Post Office and hence The Post Bar. It's a wonderful place to wait to meet up with friends. It's conveniently located in the central business district. It has music which is not too loud to be distracting and therefore you can have a conversation between yourselves. The bar also offers snacks. The bar operates with a happy hour - until 8pm I believe, and prices are very attractive during this period.Certainly a very nice place to relax and have a quiet drink.

Overall, not a good experience considering this is the bar of a hotel with such gravitas. I was here for drinks with friends on a Friday evening, prior to a function which was supposed to take place at the bar (it turned out to be at the open-air area behind the bar, but that's another story). There was a bit of a crowd but it wasn't packed to the brim. All of us experienced great difficulty getting attention from the service staff. Perhaps they were a bit stretched because of the other function - but we were there well before the function was due to start, and surely a hotel would have done this enough times to know how to cope with the additional requirements. Even when we were actually being attended to by staff, their overall demeanour (and attire) was not what you would expect at a 5-star hotel bar. Communication between the staff also seems lacking as there was tremendous confusion over our 1-for-1 happy hour orders. Considering the number of excellent bars that have sprung up around the area in recent years, Post Bar really needs to up its game

We stayed at the Fullerton so tried the bar. I had heard they made good Singapore Slings. Not only are they good - they are wonderful. All freshly made by Hairul. He is magic. They have different varieties of the sling - all great. The staff there are so much fun. Dos and the others have time for the guests at Post Bar and are very attentive. We watched the European Cup at this Bar. Had our table in front of the TV. There were 3 TVs and a big screen. Able to order light meals there. They provide nibbles. Had a great time at this locatio

Nice bar in Fullerton hotel. Quiet - doesn't get packed which is great if you want to have a conversation. Nice Postbox in the center. Service was so-so which was surprising since they weren't crowded. And quite expensive.
5
I dine at Post Bar because I enjoy quiet ambiance and unhurried service, which is perfect for talking and actually conducting business.

Popped in for a happy hour glass of wine just to check out this bar in the old Post Office (now the Fullerton Hotel). Staff friendly and snacks came with drinks. Pleasant hotel lounge bar and nice place to take the weight off your feet after a visit to the Asian Cultures Museum. Wine by the glass was fine and good value during Happy Hour. Surroundings worth a look; quite clever how they have converted the old Post Office building. Had hoped for VR or EVIIR pillar box but I guess an EIIR now has some history

Good bar to go for a drink with colleagues or clients, but it's a little overpriced for what it is if you're paying yourself.Drinks are good however and so is the service, and it's usually not too busy so good to get away from the crowds and heat.You're better off going to one of the many other bars nearby which offer better atmosphere at better prices

Awesome place to chill after work. Irman and team are he epitome of perfection and style . The drinks and food are affordable . The band is also awesome. A place I would go for any occasion. Look for Irman - he will ensure your night is always a pleasant one.

This is my first time visited the Post Bar at Fullerton Hote, but i must tell you its a supperb service by the manager name Irman and his team who treated us like a king and queen. the mini burger, pizza and all of the drinks was really good. Definitely i will recommend my friends to come here next time because everything was tipto

We have visited the Fullerton Hotel many times over the last 15 years when we are in Singapore. The Sunday Brunch is the best you can get and we always receive fantastic service from Mr Allison Li and his staff. We recently discovered the happy hour in the Post Bar and are always exactly looked after by Irman and his team. Its excellent value for money with 1 for 1 on beers and a special discounted price on the cocktails. They have a band on and big screens for the Sports during the weekends. Would highly recommend giving this bar a visi

The Post Bar as you may have already experienced or read, is situated in the lobby of the Fullerton. Did not bother to go all the way to the Raffles for a Singapore Sling and had but 20 mins so I decided to visit the Post Bar instead. When in Rome... so I ordered a Singapore Sling, I have to admit it's the best I've ever had, usually I keep avoiding this cocktail elsewhere in the world because for some reason I can't explain they all come out bubble gum-my and it's like sipping some syrup from the 80's with some alcohol. The music was good, the layout ok and the service very professional. It is true, it is a bit expensive, especially when adding the service charge (I was sitting right there at the bar!), but it was worth my mone

Let me ask you - how much talent does it require to screw up margarita? Well at the Post Bar managed to do this every single time.Please, save your $ and go somewhere. This place has overpriced drinks (even for Singapore standard) and terrible service. The only reason why one might go there is for a live music event and they managed to screw up sound system as well.Just don't

As always, I love my lunch at Post Bar. I enjoy the ambiance. I love the service & I am always treated as if I am a royal princess...even when I did not go for a few months...the staff remembers my name, knows what I like to drink including warm water before I eat, decaffeinated cappuccino after the meal. Many small details that creates such a great impression...and makes me smile. The chef has created very exquisite and special meals for me. Every lunch time is such a beautiful experience. I love Post bar!

Don't even think about it. It's overpriced and the service is soooooooooooo utterly atrocious. You can better service and better drinks else where

The Post Bar appears to have made a habit of over charging it's customers. Please check your bill. Two drinks may appear as two bottles!
3
A good place for a quiet drink after work. Usual Singapore drink prices apply so make sure you bring plenty of cash. I've never actually seen this place busy: always seems to be fairly quiet.
4
Not too much to say about this bar which is nice enough and has excellent complimentary snacks - except they have PHENOMENAL chips! They come accompanied by a roasted onion mayonnaise. Divine!!
5
A must do if you're a tourist but equally good for sundowners - good (strong) cocktails, excellent food, and probably the best (free) bar nuts in Singapore!!! (Located in the former colonial Singapore General Post Office - its a spectacular property - and the Post Bar with its lofty coffered ceiling from when it used to be the General Post Officeâ€™s transaction hall makes it a sight to behold) - Indian Curry Buffet (on Friday's) is a must. However, be prepared to spend $$$ - the Fullerton is an international renowned 5-star hotel.

Myself, my partner and my parents were all very disappointed with a vastly overpriced evening meal at the Post Bar, situated in the Fullerton Hotel. While the staff were helpful and apologetic, this was no substitute for poor quality. The lasagne looked unappetising and was badly cooked. The pizzas were alright and the fish & chips were adequate. We had no appetite for desert after our meal and even the live music didn't help. A very disappointing meal and very overpriced for the quality of food

I couldn't wait to get to the Post Bar for their famous burger. My mind and mouth have memories of the tenderness of the meat and the flavor...mmmmm... and then there are the signature potato chips.. I was salivating and quite excited to take a client there for lunch. O Oh....The recipe for the burger has changed, they now put garlic in the patty and since I'm allergic I couldn't order it. My lunch guest did though and I was almost as excited to see their face when they took their fist bite. I had to settle for a piece of fried steak instead. Alas the famous burger is no longer what it was. It's thinner and definitely not the best burger ever tried - I was a bit embarrassed as I'd built it up. The fries were still good but the serving which I remember as generous was, well stingy....6 or seven chips each. At least I have the memories of what it used to be and remember when it was hard to get a table any day of the week. No problem now, plenty of space.... sometimes it's best to leave the memories as just that. Memories. But for a different atmosphere, attentive staff and no trouble getting a table I'm sure others will make new memories there

Been wanting to visit this place for a while, and I finally got to do so on the last night of March 2015. The Post Bar speaks volumes when it comes to conveying the history of The Fullerton Hotel - a posh place converted from the building of the old general post office.The settings are sleek, chic and classy in their modern honey onyx tones and standing artichoke cardboard lamps. The motif walls and coffered ceilings are retained from the original days of when this place was used as the post office - and of course, the most obvious feature would be the red post box greeting customers at the front of the lounge (see first photo in this blog entry) - and this postbox is STILL in operation, mind you.Besides the sophisticated ambience and polite service, they have a really awesome band. I forgot to ask for their name and charges - but the male singer had a very smooth and soothing voice - completely moving me when they did Lionel Richie's "Hello".The SIL started with a Mai Tai (SGD$19.00), a large bowl-glass of cocktail sweetened by pineapple. It was certainly a very refreshing drink, and they were generous with the alcohol.I began my thirst quenching with a Classic Mojito (SGD$22.00) - they also have the strawberry or raspberry flavored ones. There was a good balance of mint and lime amongst the rum, though I would have loved the mint to be stronger. They were also very generous with the rum here.The Bro ordered a Lychee Sling - a vintage cocktail with a fruity twist, concocted by their dedicated mixologists. They actually have many different and unique flavors of Sling other than the classic Singapore Sling - such as Almond, Hazelnut, Vanilla etc. The drink was a little too sweet, like mocktails, with slight hints of alcohol in this case.For me, I ended the evening with a Raspberry Daiquiri - dashes of raspberry juice with tequila and Triple Sec, strong enough for my liking but sweetened by the dash of raspberry. I enjoyed this drink as well.For full review and more detailed information, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2015/04/drinks-at-post-bar-fullerton-hotel.htm

We went on a Monday evening. there were a few tables taken - enough so we didn't feel alone but not so many that we couldn't talk to each other. The service was outstanding and the Singapore Sling was the best I have tasted (way better than at the Long Bar!). We had some flavoured popcorn and poppadom crisps as free snacks and they were amazing. They kept being refilled as well without us even noticing. Would visit again and highly recommend

Great service is what makes up for the shortfall of ambience.Can get quite noisy if you choose to sit around near the main entrance(indoors) as the seating arrangement between tables are pretty close to one another. The outdoor area offers a nice view as you chill to the music. Great drinks selection and complimentary snack is very much appreciated, however I just don't get the idea why the snack offered has to be popcorn... but despite that, what stood out was the friendly servers who are attentive and always smiling and that gives you a genuine feeling of being welcomed at this bar
