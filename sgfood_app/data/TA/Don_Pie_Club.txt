Ordered via Waitrr for lunch and had the Curry Chicken Pie. The curry isn't too spicy and the filling was quite generous.

Don serves perfectly baked chicken pies and this is one of the few places that serves good shepard's pies in Singapore. Their original outlet in China Square has a spacious seating area for you to enjoy your pies.

Loved their chicken pie!!! Crusty and flaky on the outside but moist and chewy on the inside. Lots of chicken and veggies... It isn't a hollow chicken pie.. It can be quite filling

I've been buying from Don Pie Club since he opened his shop near Raffles Place some 14 yrs ago. When he was a one man shop. Recently bought one for my 10 yr old nephew when o dropped by for a visit. They loved it. This is excellent gift to bring when visiting someone's home. Children love the egg and potatoes. I get mine from Vivocity.
