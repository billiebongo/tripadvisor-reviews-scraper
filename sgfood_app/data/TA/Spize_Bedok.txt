Place to go if you're hunting for local food. Price range cheap. Food taste okay, nothing to complaint - average. The Padprik fried rice and Kampung fried rice is good.
3
Went there for our business training dinner to build up the bond and team work. Once get seated, we ordered some brunch to get started for the night and follow with light dinner. Quality is just average .
5
Always go to this outlet because food is definitely better compared to RV. Bedok's one ever disappoint!
4
Drinks were served fast. But food took a long time. And it was not cooked properly. Overall good experience.
5
food was on time as well as the drinks. Service its all excellent. would definitely come down to spize again!

This is a popular restaurant in the east but I suspect the customers did not go there for its Penang char kway teow.Instead of Penang char kway teow, what I got was something far from it and probably a combination of Singapore char kway teow, kl hokkien mee and hor fun.It was big gooey mass of sweet syrupy kway teow with no taste of any of the three dishes it tried to pass itself as.I suspect the cook has no idea what is Penang char kway teow and employed his imagination to the fullest attempt possible.Perhaps its better with western dishes though its rack of lamb was also on the sweet side and the waiter did not think it necessary to ask for our preference on doneness.Oh..btw..this restaurant charges 50c for water and they do not tell you its chargeable. It also doesnt take credit card payments, only nets or cash.I will not return

Been to this place a few times previously and it hasn't disappoint me. Maybe the crowd on Sunday (3 Sep) is less. Nevertheless the food choices are just amazing and they keep adding on new food items to their menu. We tried the Sriracha and Honey Chicken Wings and they are really good.It's a ritual that we always keep rooms for dessert.The Molly's Brownies are still the BEST I have tried, even comparing to many 5 stars eateries or hotels. The Chendol Sling is good too, as it's not too sweet with a generous serving of Gula Melaka.Overall, reasonably priced good with acceptable service.Will be back again very soon.Thank you Spiz

Brought here by a colleague when I was on a business trip and since I was looking for something local, this was a good place to bring me from around the Changi Business Park area.The malay dishes were pretty good and nicely priced. There were a lot of local clients there which shows the good draw and local fare this place serves.We had the nasi goreng (fried rice) dishes as we needed to rush back for meetings but there were other choices better suited for groups and would be happy to recommend this place for the malay food as well as the hawker-like ambiance for both lunches and dinners

Singapore was the first stop on our visit to this region. We ended up on the beach and nearly choked at the prices being charged by those situated beachfront, but most importantly it weren't HALAL... so it was always going to be a massive NO.Someone suggested BEDOK and good old UBER were on hand to oblige. Spize won the palate on the night, not having any prior knowledge of this place. This place is amazing. 5 blokes, all too critical of their food and all walruses in the food experience. We were genuinely knocked back at the food taste. It was just on another level. The premise was spread outside infront of other daytime business that had closed. The restaurant, no way near enough to meet demand, so in the soaring heat, outside seating was just a bonus. With at least 150-200 persons sat down, there as a que all the time we were there, apprx hour and half. If you love food as much as I do, sorry WE do, don't leave Singapore without trying this place. Any more plugging, I would have to charge them commission

Went with a group of friends (about 8) on a Friday night. They lost the order for our drinks once, and we had to prod them about the drinks twice when it did not arrive. My friend's meal was also lost and we had to re-order that and wait an extra 15 minutes for them to prepare the meal.I ordered a mushroom grilled burger and requested for an extra egg as well as removal of beef, and was pleased with their flexibility to accommodate my special order.Signboard was huge and obvious, and location was good. Plenty of parking available.Prices are typical of restaurants, with a meal averaging S$13, excluding drinks
5
Venue was good. food was good except that the waiting time for fried noodles took much more longer time compared to other food. Food was tasty. Especially the satay were good!
5
Pricing is a bit pricey.... but overall its great and a nice place to chit chat and chills with friends and families...... if possible try to lower down bit of the price... Thank You Spize
5
Enjoyed the food, service was good. From pre- to post reservation, was done very professionally. Keep it up.
4
Wide menu selection and very affordable. Tastes good too. :) open till late. Prompt delivery as well.
4
Food was awesome and big in portion! The services stuff is very helpful and the food comes in fast and pipping hot!
2
The lowest review I have ever given. The saving grace was the friendly service. Each one of the dish we ordered, prata, mee goreng, cha Kway teow and rojak was overly sauced, lacks a fried taste, as if they were made from pre-mix.
4
Food was good and service was fast. It was a bit hot though but that can't be helped cause it's open air seating
4
We like to bring our guests to Spize.
There are so many variety of food to choose from.
One pet peeves about this place is the attitude of the servers. I hope that there'll be an improvement on how the servers handle guests.
2
Have been here for the 7th time. Asked for a medium steak (can't trust them for any rarer). Got a bien cuit . There is no problem from the staff's perspective. May be they are not expecting me to observe.. I got sh t
3
Was walking around this area and happened to pass by this restaurant. It was packed during lunch so I thought maybe I'll give it a try.Ordered the maggie goreng pattaya. Took at least 15-20 min before it arrived. Guess it's due to the heavy lunch crowd. But when it arrived, I find it rather soggy. The serving was generous though
5
Love their steak! It's so tempting! Gonna make another trip again. And I am from west zone .. it's far for me to travel for good food.
5
Variety of great food at a convenient location. We were glad when they gave us a sit in an air condition room as there were 12 of us. Thank you for the service!
5
Nice food all the time. You will get a good quality local cuisine. This is not air-conditioned place, be prepared for a humid and hot experience to be added to the spicy food :-)
5
Great food for gathering. Food portion is big and worth the price. Staff are friendly, good service.
4
What is amazing about the menu is its variety. It ranges from local favourites to western food and even Mediterranean. The drinks menu is also wonderful. Prices are reasonable as well.
4
The portions are huge, and are pretty affordable. However, take note that they take pretty long to serve their food during peak periods etc. supper & dinner. But other than that, the food is great!
5
foods are delicious, entire place is very clean and organized and their services are very good. overall, a tip-top services!
5
I like coming here with my colleagues, they have a very wide range of food to suit the taste and needs of my friends from around the region.
5
Staff Friendly & Patience....
Food tip top!
Drinks awesome....
Never even being chase out even sitting & chilling till late night...
5
Believe me or not, this is the first time we had choose "Spize" for our dinner lol. Opted for delivery service and it was more then we had expected.Had chosen for dinner to arrive at 910pm, but it actually reach us at around 845pm. That was fast! Food were amazingly delicious too! Definitely a happy tummy :
5
Spize at Bedok or Well known as 'Simpang Bedok' is a must go. There are really various and lots of choices for the menu.
A must try. Price is affordable. Service was Excellent. Highly Recommended !
Thumbs up !
4
They have a wide selection of food. Local, Seafood, Indian, Western, Middle East. The portions are generous and the food tastes great. Their desserts are fantastic too. Can be very crowded during peak hours.
5
My Daughter lithium will whack it every time ! 24/7 always open, beside is 24hours giant, so convenient. Bus 9,2 and many more
5
Always drop by to Spize for great comfort food with reasonable price. Roti john and murtabak. The chicken shawarma is my father's favourite.
This eatery has been around for a while and keep getting better. It really gives good service too!
4
We go to Spize at least once a week. It is great. The menu has reduced in recent years and that has improved the quality.
Something for everyone and even if not they will accomodate your request.
A true gem in the Singapore food scene.
5
Everything there is superb! Great food! great atmosphere! great service! kids friendly! Will recommend this to all my other relatives!
5
I just visited Spize, Bedok outlet for dinner tonight. it was by accident that I found this place but I am glad I did. with a vast menu selection from Indian, Mediterranean, Western, Indonesian, Malaysian, Thai this is place is absolute value for money considering the quantity and quality of the food. The outdoor sitting is well lit and well maintained. The staff is friendly and quick to assist you. Absolutely recommended
5
Always loved their gigantic grande drinks! Their roti john is to die for, and amongst the other things I like too are their spice star burger, shawarma, Nasi goreng Ayam tiga rasa, Mee goreng pattaya and oat prawns. It is THE only place that sells a variety of food from different cuisines
4
My local busy restaurant is always consistent with menu and quality. Great selection of dishes from local and international, always busy and fresh. Very much in tune with the local area so be advised no beer or wine etc. However, upstairs or next door have the wider appeal for those in need of a beer

i. I used to had a good impression about this restaurant because I used to come few times after working nearby with my Malay colleague. o Famouso Successful. The crowd gives you the illusion that the food was good. o If you're hungry, food was served quickly.o Good portion. x Hot hot hot hotx Terrible terrible service. I am doubting my eagerness to revisit. ii. A night that I deliberately brought my parents here after our visit to Gardens by the Bay because in my mind, it was or supposed to be good. From the excellent Garden by the Bay to this Simpang Bedok's restaurant, the distance and hunger kinda built our hopes up since I sold my parents the "awesomeness" of this shop. It turns out to be a great let down. The expectancy was under-delivered. iii. It was already 9PM when we arrived, the crowds weren't as packed anymore. Plenty of seats and we sat down with one waiter wiping the table for us upon arrival. It was the only gesture of hospitality. We were in the very front where the cashier can see us, yet we waited for more than five minutes for the menus. It was very evident that we were new customers and just arrived, but their lack of observance caused us to feel unwelcome and not relevant. Huge disappointment. If we weren't there for food, why are we even there? (Should have taken the initiative to pass us few copies of menus, that is Restaurant Service 101.) iv. The unpleasant experience extended to our time of check out where the cashier showed no hospitality and respect. It was a total disaster. Not to mention the quality of food. It almost felt like there is prejudice in their treatment based on the people you're with. x the food was under expectationv. We ordered three different dishes, let's start off with the Spize Burger. The burger was large, the beef patty was quite granulated. It did not taste very fresh. The buns were thick and not really edible, presentation is fine. Fries are normal frozen supermarket fries. I'd rate this dish overall 2/5. vi. This is the worst dish: the "Penang Fried Kuay Teow". This dish is utterly an insult to the authentic Penang Kuay Teow. First of all, it was wet and flooded with sauce. The taste was not even remotely close to 20% that of the Penang one, it was sour with slight hints of sweetness. Presentation was mediocre. Overall 1/5.vii. The best of the three during our dining experience. The Pattaya Fried Rice was well done with the rice rich in spices and flavor. Not wet and not to dry while the eggs are excellently wrapped around the fried rice, setting a standard of the basic presentation of Pattaya Fried Rice. I would rate 4/5
5
atmosphere is excellent and service was mostly prompt. only complaint is that one of our meals was served half hour after the break fast time. that was unpleasant
5
Love it all! Great food & excellent service. Food was in time for break fast & delicious too. Everyone was happy. Thank you.
5
It's very nice. I had a great time :) food was good as well! There's a lot of variety I can choose from!
4
Chope is a good alternative mode of reservation. We did our reservation midday. An hour before our reservation time, we got a phone call to double confirm.
4
Food is good and price is worth the quality of food. Better to go earlier to avoid having to queue :)
5
Excellent ambience in aircon room. Good variety of food and service. My 2nd visit & brought my family this time & they were impressed. Will definitely be back.
5
Was given a place in the aircon area when requested eventhough the area was supposed to be open after 7pm. Food arrive was not long. Service was friendly n warm.
5
A delightful outdoor eating outlet at Simpang Bedok hete has an aura of stylish alfresco dining area which proved to be popular in the eastern part of Singapore.The menu in this outlet is so varied that one has problem in choosing what to have. It serves local, regional, continental and western cuisines much to our tasteful delights.Service has improved tremendously well and staff are well trained in taking orders and clearing tables.Takeaway items are also available and getting in and out there is easy as abc with many bus and taxi services available. There is ample parking nearby and ATM machines placed around the surrounding area.Come early in the evening espeially ad it gets crowded after 7 pm
4
I went there twice, two days in a row. Oh My! I've been to Singapore to streets food many times but to be honest this one was the best. Best prices best taste and just awesome. Its a must try!! The portion is quite bigMy fave was hummus and mee goreng seafood. Their fries is absolute deal! I definitely coming back. Spize is spizentastic xx
5
Before leaving on vacation, we had listed Spize as a possible place to eat in Singapore. We arrived on their doorstep with hungry kids and without a reservation. The queue was 20min but the staff made every effort to seat us quickly amidst the young and trendy crowd. The atmosphere was light and relaxed, service friendly and helpful. The food was reasonably priced and very tasty. The waiter's recommendations were helpful and a huge ice cold milo was perfect for our 6 year old who was almost asleep on his feet. A good experience, well worth another visit
4
Though it was well-packed with customers, the flow was surprisingly smooth. Not to mention the great food, well-served and value for money 👍👍
4
Excellent service and the food was awesome. The children loves the wide variety.of choices available.
4
Cheap and nice food, with cooling environment. Ideal place to invitate foriegner friends over for a local makan food place.
5
Staff are attentive, great food, portion just nice, tidy, clean and well organized. Will be back for more and highly recommend for our friends.
5
A very crowded place to eat at since the food is well, pretty sick ! as in awesome.. But the service and waiting time is not that long, you'll still have an enjoyable meal be it with family or friends !
5
Great food with ambience. Food is cheap and service is extrememly prompt. Try the mushroom soup is super!
3
Nice night gathering with family and friends.. use to have great great great foods.. we did not mind the expensive cost.. until recently, the quality has went down.. not that nice anymore.. but we will certainly come back and try a different dish for a change.
5
This was the second time I visited the outlet. Online booking for 20 pax and additional add on to 27 pax without any hassle. Very impressed with their staff service and attentiveness. Though they were extremely busy during the CNY period, they were well mannered and always smile. Super good service and the food was great. Highly recommended for any company events
1
We have been waited for our order for more than 1 hour.Their clams and seafoods are not fresh. Their food pricing are Expensive. We regret to say that this restaurant is just Full of disappointments
4
Always heard about the place but neven been here. It was so happen that my friend's house just opposite the place so when i visited her, i came here for dinner. Usually, you have to queue during dinner time as it always full house. there are wide range of food you can choose, from Malay, Indian, chinese, western, mediterranean, Thai etc. This restaurant is halal certified, hence Malay friends can dine in safely. I tried twice, food generally are good. Will come again if i am around her
4
Had a great dinner with family. Lots of food choices to choose from. Loved it.. Will be back soon to try out others.
4
loved the steaks and the local delights. good quality and quantity. definately recommend for family outings and late night dinners.
3
Food quality can be improved and also price is a bit steep. Mushroom soup is a must try. Atmosphere is electrifying if there is a live soccer match.
4
Nice place to have a meal. Lots of option from the menu. Ordered the roasted lamb wrap, tasted great. Went there on Mon afternoon, lots of empty seats, food came out straight away, great service. Price is reasonable. Would definitely return ...
4
A place where you can be yourself. Not a place where you can relax, but it was a good experience with a chatty family of mine! we enjoyed celebrating our brothers birthday, thank you SPIZE corner for the wonderful service! oh yes a place where you better make reservations earlier
1
It was saturday night. Place was packed. So we waited patiently for our food to be served. After an hour of waiting, to our amazement, customers around our table who came later than us and ordered the local cuisine too, got their food except us. Had to ask the workers for our food more than 5 times. Terrible. And i just ordered chicken rice and i had to wait for an hour. Great. Spoiled my family appettite to eat and also our mood for that day
4
Since I stay nearby Spize is perfect for our midnight cravings! The price is reasonable and the food is superb. Their steak (about $25) is something we always look forward to ordering. Service is fast, not to mention that it's always busy for the most time we were there.
3
The food was served timely especially during the Ramadhan Iftar time. However food quality need some improvement in taste.I would have rank it very good if the food taste is good but......I had Char Keow Teow Penang style. This was on soup style but it was too watery and spoils the taste
3
This is THE place to go if you are looking for halal food especially on late nights.Its always crowded. Service is fast. Be prepared to queue during peak period even when they have available seats, they expect you to queue. I had walked into sit with my husband (there were at least space for 10 pax), the waiter asked me to go out and stand at the Q line (there was no one there queing) and when we walked back to stand in Q, he signalled us to come back and sit at the same spot where we had earlier sat! That put me off.Anyway, be prepared to pay $2-$3 more than what you pay in other eateries. The penang char kway teow tasted ok with a miserable tiny 4-5 clams and 3 medium sized prawns. Damage? $6.50My husband ordered the tasty Tiga rasa seafood fried rice. $7.20. Yes, it is expensive. We ordered mineral water costing $1.80 but we were given their in house Spize water bottle (not mineral water mind you). I felt cheated of coz.Their drinks are $2+ onwards normally and that is coz they r large sized. Including drinks, main meal and chicken cheese roti john (if you are lucky you can get about 3 small pcs of chicken in it), our meal was $28+.i have been patronising this outlet like once in a month normally for supper. But i feel that for the expensive rates, it is high time, i find an alternative
4
Spize at Simpang Bedok is a great place to have meal with friends or family. A non air condition restaurant. The restaurant is a favourite amongst the local. Spize have varieties of dishes. From prata, few style of nasi goreng, western food and lots more. Ther price is very reasonable. Weekend evening are mostly crowded
3
Nice place, close to MRT, typical area for this section of town could. I went with my wife, and the place had average prices and service. Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
4
Have always been dining here and never get bored. Lots of choices from local to western and grills. Food was great and affordable definitely. Waiting time depends on crowd.
5
Check out Zion Rd (central) if you have a seeking-attention personality disorder. Zouk is just a distance away so u might expect-expats coming along to spice up the night.!
5
There is a wide variety of food, quality ingredients with good portion and wonderful service! Will definitely go there again! Highly recommended

I and my wife have dinner at Bedok Spize.We order Tom yam Seafood Soup ,$12.50 .Fresh large prawn and tasty.Nasi Goreng Seafood $5.80 seafood was also very fresh .Bullet Steak $17.90 steak sauce was good ,large portion of Fresh Veg.steak portion was atleast 220gm value for money.Sour Plum Limau & Avocado milk shake was little too sweet.But be prepare to wait 30min or more for your food to come during dinner time but is worth waiting for .Service staff was attentive and very friendly

As much as it pains me to write this review as a frequent patron of this establishment, Spize Bedok broke the cardinal rule of the F&B business. I patronize Spize at least once a week and this recent incident has undoubtedly tarnished the reputation of Spize. This is a message to the management and owners - do not serve food that you yourself would not eat. You can afford to flout all the other principles of running a good F&B establishment but I'm afraid this is one rule you must not contravene. It is utterly disrespectful to the very people who support your business. Please see the attached picture - burnt steak, absolutely not fit to be served to your valued guests. Any self-respecting cook/chef or business owner would certainly not allow such a thing to happen. To the management - you are free to discuss this matter with me. This happened on 10th January 2015 and was a take-out order
1
sat at an empty table with 2 other friends but was told we cant order from that table due to unpaid bills from previous patrons!? Staff attending to us was an FT with no basic professionalism and courtesy. Ridiculous and appalling attitudes from the staff
4
The menu offered an extensive range of culinary options to choose from, leaving us spoilt for choices which was a good start to begin with. In fact, so much so that it took us a while before we decided what we wanted. Options ranged from a whole variety of delightful Asian dishes to Western delights. We ended up having Roti John Mutton with Cheese and Nasi Goreng Daging with basil of which both were superb. Taste- wise, both items will score a 5/5. I would however have to mention that the serving portion for the Nasi Goreng was albeit a little small especially so if this was meant a man. It would definitely be more than enough if this was for a lady though.Service levels were awesome to begin with.We were attended to, the moment we arrived and were pleasantly surprised by the short waiting time before both the dishes were served piping hot. I would also have to notably credit the staff who took our orders for his attentiveness. We had requested for an additional plastic cup for my 3rd old while placing the order and while a lot of waiters would not have included this on their list forgetting this much later that we even had this request based on past experiences. All our drinks were served along with the additional request we had made. Thumbs up once again! :) Food prices were a little higher compared to the usual hawker fares, however having said that the taste and service levels definitely does make up for this aspect. The outdoor seating was especially cool given the generous numbers of fans that were switched on to ease the humidity. However, this I might add did turn the food cold sooner than it should. A small drawback here. Perhaps they could reduce the speed of the fans. On the whole, it was a more than satisfying dining experience. I will recommend this place
4
They offer a good range of Asian favourites with a few Western dishes, so no-one should be stuck for choice. The portions are good too, as is the value for money. The steaks are particularly good for the price (ok, it's not prime US or kobe beef, but you're not paying for that).There are plenty of tables in the open air here, and the place is generally busy, particularly at weekends. It is not a venue for a quiet romantic evening with a loved one, but roll up your sleeves and tuck into some good food. I have not been disappointed yet
2
We order a couple of orders : taken order by In charge BERNIE... Promise to tried his best in delivering but received the order late by more den 20minutes .... It was a fasting month we dont expect much but we still have to wait for our order for more den 20 minutes and the delivery charges are as much as Sgd 12.00 .. Its unreasonable for the preson to Only apologising and doing Nothing ,.... GOOD FOOD BUT BAD SERVICE !!!!!
