We went on a weekday afternoon for lunch. Most items on the menu are not available. Quite disappointing. The pandan chiffon cake is one of the best we have tasted.
4
When we visited, many of the food items were not available as they were in the process of changing the menu. Food was good but pricey even with the Entertainer app.

Good atmosphere to take people visiting singapore to have quality local food. However, the local food is understandably more expensive than the hawker stores.

not my first visit at 1933 capitol, conveniently located at cityhall mrt exit D , a great meetup place for me and my friends working in town. fav dishes include the grilled pork chop and laksa pasta.

Service staff are very attentive and polite. Food is affordable and tasty. Portions are just nice too (: The satay is really good!
4
The staff are all friendly and provided prompt service. The local food is great but pricey for the portion. Enjoyed our evening here.

Brought my Japanese friend here to try Hainanese Chicken Rice. For some reason, the chicken RICE was sold out. I begged her to ask the chef to whip up a plate just for my Japanese friend as that night (Saturday) was her last night in Singapore. The 1933 kitchen had run out of chicken rice but they still had chicken. In the end, the chef managed to give my JP friend the chicken rice she wanted. So thank u to the chef and Allisha for helping us out. My JP friend rated the chicken rice 10/10!I had the Laksa Pasta (since can't order chicken rice). Not their best. I do not recommend this bland Laksa dish. Rating: 1/10. Yes it was not nice at all. And too much coconut!We had the Pandan Cake with Gula Melaka. Excellent! Rating 9/1

I try pasta with local lasa flavor and it is delicious but not really up to expectation. Food menu look interesting where they mixed western and local food with different arrangement and flavors. If you sit in the corner near escalator you will get difficulties to get attention of waiters and need to take long to order something.

we ordered a bread bowl mushroom soup.. and was serve soup in a bowl and 5 piece of bread separately..Staff said, oh I forgot to tell you we've run out of Bread bowl. and we ask for more bread because the bread given is very little compare to the bread bowl portion. and in the end we were charged for the additional bread-.- the staff ask me to check my bill and bread wasn't included, and upon paying using credit card the bread was included. Staff not honest. how can my checking and actual of bill vary?but we did ask them to waived off

It was basic Toastbox fare at double the price. But it is a great location - certainly not as crowded as Toastbox outlets are normally. The Capitol Piazza is an interesting place to hang out - not overly popular, yet, but it has a lot going for it in terms of ambience (and that great Singapore tradition of combining colonial architecture with modern styling)

highly recommend 1933's pork chops! super tender and we all know its not easy to get pork chops right. the sauce n salad that came with the pork chop was great too
3
We had breakfast at this small restaurant and it was good. Limited Menge for breakfast but what was on offer was very enjoyable. Coffee is ok
5
really nice place to chill out with friend in late afternoon.
The service is professional, warm and prompt.
the food is good and prices are reasonable.
That's Toast Box with service at table !
4
Overall, I enjoy my meals here. Service is great and vigilant with servers topping up water. However, quantity can be improved especially Set lunch soup which is meagre. Set lunch is only 2-course and excludes coffee/ tea. Taste is good and food thoughtfully prepared.
4
1933 set lunch was worth it. Food was better than expected. Only disappointment was the pandan chiffon was came highly recommended. Didn't look as good as the pictures.
4
Overall good experience, food was good. Portions are huge, price was worth it. Atmosphere is generally ok

One, i just love the Capitol Piazza, warm and opulent ambience. The food at 1933 is divine. The mushroom soup takes you on a taste voyage.
Do yourself a favour and try out the Hananaise chicken.
5
Being a third visit to this place and food quality still remained impressed. Has been pretty affordable and love the portion served on every visit.

I saw online that this place opens at 8am so I booked a table via Chope for a informal work meeting for my boss at 10am. The reservation was accepted. On the day itself, they arrived to find it closed. I checked online again & saw they changed their opening time to 1030am. But no one informed me in advance. Thankfully my boss was very understanding & did not blame me. Surely they should inform customers with reservations if they are not open at that time

Popped into 1933 at Capitol Piazza after lunch last week for some local tea. Service was a bit slow, but the tea was pretty much the same as it normally is for local tea. Slightly nicer surroundings than the usual local tea place which justifies the higher prices
4
Cannot miss a Singaporean breakfast. Always available all day long.
Still cheaper than the rest around the mall
5
Portion of the food was generous. Service was good, and so was the ambience. The steak was nicely done up. Two thumbs up. Third time visiting 1933 and still happy with my dining experience ;)

The local food is good and authentic. The service is good too with friendly staff. However, this place is a tad too warm to enjoy a good dinner.
5
Good for tourist to dine but locals may not fancy the 'high class' local food dining experience.
Still cheaper than the rest around the mall

Love the ambience. But because we came too early, they only served the breakfast menu. Likely to come back for the rest of the menu, and to check out the Capitol Theatre.
5
Their location is perfect because you feel like dining al fresco only it is airconditioned. The place is very quaint as I was informed it was a former theatre. Well they still have a theatre but with so much food choices around.We just ordered desserts and I like it... I forgot the name but took a picture of it. Coffee is good! The were good too... Service was quick and staff was friendly.

I visited 1933 for dinner and had a good time. The staff were friendly and service was decent although some were inexperienced (when pouring wine some spilled to the table), the dinner portions were big and the prices very affordable. The fish and chips and grilled pork we ordered were delicious. Would visit again soon
5
This was my second visit but this time round was a lunch session. Expected heavy lunch crowd but still managed to get the attention from the servers and also good alternative executive lunch set from their manager. Love the food portion, taste and presentation. Will definitely recommend to my friends and be back for more in near future

I was there for the nanyang curry chicken. Despite running out of white rice, they did not inform me but served me chicken rice instead. How can you have chicken rice with curry? That's way too oily. They don't even bother to.inform me. What lousy service is that
4
I had this delightful Nanyang Curry Chicken, which was served in a crusty yet soft bread bowl! It was yummy!

Well done again break talk group. Good service by restaurant manager Ken!
The set dinner is really decent, and wine at happy hour comes with satay!
Satay is divine! Salivate.
Steak is well done and the lamb loin is good.
Pretty impressed by breaktalk.

The ambience is good, it's bright and aircon is not too cold. Local and the usual cafe food which is fine but "nothing special"
3
I think the idea behind the restaurant is to serve premium hawker style food. It is a bit hard to justify hainan chicken rice at six times the price at a hawker's. For the money you get to sit inside an airconditioned premium shopping mall.
4
Tried their New year set, was quite impressed as the dishes are quite delicious! No complaints :) Highly recommended!

Pretty exquisite place to spend your dough. The ambience is more towards fine dining though it has a tinge of open air concept. Menu however is quite limited and it feels too costly for whatever you are paying for. But still, good place to try at least onc

1933 serves good local food, although it is a little pricey. Service was good and they had some lunch promotions which was nice. The taste of the local food is also more in tune with the tourists. E.g. The chilli can be more sweet than spicy. Locals might not find the food here authentic enough for them. Had the chicken rice and the laksa pasta which was delightful. The only dessert which was the pandan cake, was also nice.Good experience overall, just not a place that is value for money
4
Restaurant is very accessible and I love it that it's in the Capitol, new mall but trying to preserve touches from the past. It's also not overly packed like most of the commercial malls, makes a good option for a quiet lunch date.Food portion was very decent, tasted really good too! Had their grilled pork loin, was very well done, meat was so tender and nicely seasoned, it was falling off the bone. Rib eye was great too. Sides were of good quality (e.g. the tomatoes they used were sweet etc.

My friends and I were glad to return to 1933@Capitol Piazza again for lunch on 16 Feb 16 (as our last visit was in late Nov 15). We were seated immediately upon our arrival as there was no crowd, probably a consequence of post-Lunar New Year respite.We ordered the lunch sets for each of us: Grilled Chicken Leg and Pan-fried Salmon Fish Fillet. As previously, each set was served with a fair portion of potato cuts and mixed vegetables; as well as a soup-in-bread, a slice of pandan-cake and a frothy iced lemon-tea.We thoroughly enjoyed the food, which were served in satisfactory portions without ever getting a feeling of overeating (of course, affordably priced too). The black pepper sauce complemented and enhanced the tender chicken well. Real yummy! Staff were amiable and attentive, tactfully maintaining a discreet distance from customers while also promptly responsive to their needs. A good outing for us indeed
