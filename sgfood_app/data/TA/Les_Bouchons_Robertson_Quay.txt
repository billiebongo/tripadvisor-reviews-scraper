Small 'french style' restaurant.
We loved the onion soup; the meat and french fries were OK.
But average service and a bit over priced.
4
Not the biggest menu but when steak is this good, it doesn't need to be... The fillet steak is excellent, comes with a decent salad and free flow fries, what's not to like...
4
I went to Les bouchons a couple of times already and I do not have much to say except that their food is very tasty and I always look forward to dine here. Overall great friendly staff to have a nice diner.
4
The steak is of big portion which can be shared if you are a smaller eater. Not really cheap but affordable for the quality. We had the bone marrow and onion soup too which is really delicious.
4
Steak was great. Good and friendly service. Price is on higher side.
Restaurant has tables both inside and outside, next to Singapore river.
Menu is limited.
1
Ordered the cote de beuf for 3 person but sharing for 2 they said no free flow of fries. Look at the price come on it was just fries, we were just tourist trying your food, we even ordered dessert don’t understand why we cannot have free flow of fries. Was served by a pleasant looking lady we had indoor and she was crying that I had to offer a tissue, guess it is really not a nice place there. That all I can say is employees first then they will treat your customers right. Overall we regretted dining there though the lady was nice

I made an online reservation prior to my visit to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday in Singapore. We ordered the Giant “Cote de Boeuf” (Prime Rib) 1Kg, one of the "specials of the house," which came with a bowl of salad, bread, and free flow of french fries. The prime rib cooked medium both looked and tasted so good we couldn't stop eating! At the end of the meal, we ordered a chocolate cake, which came on a nicely decorated plate with a message "happy birthday" (I asked them if they could do a little surprise on our dessert plate through email when I made the reservation!). The staffs were friendly and generous throughout our stay and undoubtedly nice enough to celebrate and take pictures of us for my boyfriend's birthday. They definitely succeeded at making us walk out of the restaurant with our stomachs full, hearts warm, and lots of smiles! Access is also great as it's located along the river, so you can take a nice 15-minute walk to Clark Quay station. Again, thank you so much for everything. Will definitely come back again (from Japan!):

This was my last night of a ten week bounce around Asia. I decided to treat myself to a meal here. I passed it, looked at the menu and thought "Why not?"Good decision. After being well welcomed, I decided to go for the duck and ordered a bottle of red bojo (chilled, perfect)The chef came out to chat and how specifically I wanted my duck cooked. Nice touch and shows a good sense of precision and service.It arrived absolutely spot on. Delicious. And with the most perfect fries, à volonté, everyone's a winner.Lovely food, lovely wine and great service. I couldn't finish a whole bottle of bojo so sent a glass in to the chef to say thanks. Hope he enjoyed it.

A pleasant restaurant in a nice spot, with an outside terrace, and a view.Good service and a nice menu mainly with meat cuts.We had first a good terrine, and then a grilled sirloin, with french fries of course!Great meat, juicy and cooked to our liking.A decent wines list with a good rosé wine too, ideal in this hot weather.Ready to good back as soon as i am tired of the local delicacies.Bravo

Eating steaks can be an expensive business, but you needn’t spend big money to eat good ones.Although not cheap-as-chips, Les Bouchons Rive Gauche is a quaint little French restaurant at Robertson Quay. Although I had a placed a reservation, the table I was allocated was in a twilight zone spot of the restaurant….partially inside and partially outside the restaurant. I ended up being moved to three different tables that one evening. That would have, on a normal night, spoiled my mood and appetite but the restaurant manager – Valentine, was absolutely gracious throughout and did his best to ensure we have a good experience.Now about the food…you can demolish either the grilled rib eye steak with “vigneron” butter or grilled sirloin steak with herbs, both served with Mixed Salad & Free Flow of Home Made French Fries. Either one and you will end the evening feeling pretty damn satisfied.I need to tell you about the fries. They are cooked in duck fat. Duck, fat and fries are three words that please most people. Combining them is a very beautiful thing. There’s no looking back once you have tried these brown and crispy fries.While not quite as revelatory as the hype might suggest, Les Bouchons Rive Gauche certainly dishes out good steaks. This is the true truth as I say it as it is

This is a good steak restaurant, quality food, good service, great location, and just a nice easy going place to meet friends and have a good catch up over great wine and food.
5
Went here for a birthday dinner and had such an incredible meal! The staff were wonderful, the service fast, the steaks perfectly cooked and the salads and bread delicious. Each steak comes with a good sized side salad, a lot of fries and a selection of four sauces as well as a complimentary bread basket. The rib-eye was delicious, melted in my mouth and only cost 39 dollars! Not bad at all. The creme brulee was excellent and I could have easily closed my eyes and been eating and drinking along the Seine in Paris. Highly recommend this place
5
Cute little piece of Paris in Singapore. Tried to find a small place for a somewhat romantic dinner and found it here. Food was good with not too expensive price tag. Service was friendly and exceptionally fast. Menu is short and simple so the kitchen is able to meet the demand. Hint: make a table reservation online especially on a weekend night - even if it was just an hour before your dining time
5
We really fancied a good steak and we got one. My wife and I shared the Cote De Boeuf. What a great steak. It was just so tasty and cooked exactly as we ordered. Had a really nice bottle of red to go with it and had a really enjoyable evening. Staff were great and chilled ice water was continually topped up
4
Birthday dinner for a friend was great. The steak was superb. Love the steak. The service was good as well as the staffs was very patient and polite with us despite us having troubles in ordering our food as we not too sure what to order. They served us the birthday cake with the lights off as well. Thanks for snapping for us pictures as well. I'm a hotel concierge that is located nearby robertson quay and I will definitely recommend this restaurant to my guest without a doubt.

Although the place is rather hidden, it was not very difficult to find behind the renovation works. Nothing to boast about the outside view as it was all cordoned off with. However the cozy ambience in the restaurant could make up. It was not a decadent deco, just warm and relaxing surroundings with kopitiam chairs, simple list of menu and bits of French posters.The restaurant wait staff are helpful, Restaurant Manager is friendly and can provide good recommendation. We ordered a ribeye steak and sirloin steak. They are quite huge (approx. 200-300 grams). Served with generous portion of salad and fries. Steaks are great, delicious and a real value for money. I asked them to change the fries to salad and I received two large portion of salad, the service staff accommodated to my request happily. Genuine, hearty food. They have quite extensive options for wine, but their house wine was wonderful! I have never enjoyed red wine as smooth as theirs. The dessert was unassumingly fantastic. I love how the cherries was soaked and drenched in brandy with two scoops of vanilla ice-cream. This is a little heaven
2
Bit difficult to find due to surrounding renovation works. View all blocked and was brought to a horrible corner table (just because we were early). Anyway, our experience:- Bread rolls served cold. - Butter frozen. - Servers casually dressed, could do with better uniform.- Steaks were done nicely.- Frites look unappetising but tasted good.- Salad portion was nice. - Chardonnay's good. Would we visit again? Probably not. Ambience and warm hospitality were severely lacking for this $150 meal.
5
Les Bouchons moved recently from its former location but only a very short distance and is still located within sight of the waters edge at Robertsons Quay.This was our first visit, we were seated at a table outside although the opened up interior looked just as good.We ordered two sirloin steaks and one rib eye and a cap rest salad to share for starters together with plenty of drinks.The steaks were perfectly cooked and tasted delicious, the service was attentive without being bothersome and we had an interesting chat with the charming French manager.All in all a most enjoyable evening
4
Had the Ribeye steak on my visit. Requested the steak to cooked rare. The portion was relatively big, accompanied by a huge portion of French Fries. The steak I would say was one of the nicer steaks I had tried. Although it was a relatively short Anniversary celebration with my wife, I enjoyed the dinner
4
Met a couple of friends for dinner as it had been recommended. Menu offers mainly steak but there were a couple of alternativesWe all had rump steak which was served with chips and a side salad. I ordered medium rare and that's exactly how it was served. A delicious streak beautifully cooked and every relish to accompany it was offered
3
Food and service was average. Good value for the steak and frites. Selection was good. Service not so good, they seemed to be rushing us along.
4
The meat and vegetables are great, but French fries are a bit overcooked, too burned for us.
And the desserts are a bit too sweet.
Apart from that, for meat lovers, it is delicious!
5
very vood Food and wine very good service evrything perferct i recommend to any people like french food
3
The steaks and fries were good, but service could have been better. Good place to go for a weekday craving
5
Great food and friendly service. Must book as it is very popular every day of the week. Try the weekend special menu, it is very authentic.
4
Singapore is known to give you steak at super small sizes. Atleast here with the hefty price tag, you get genuine service and the steak is nice and big.
3
Had to send our steaks twice to the litchen because they kept bringing undercooked meat.
You would think a steak house would know what well-done means.
5
This is my favorite place for authentic steak frites in Singapore, with a very reasonably priced menu and great al fresco atmosphere flanking the Singapore River along Robertson Quay. Passed by yesterday evening and discovered from its website that the restaurant is moving to the Quayside a few steps down – will miss the original, quieter location
1
Came here with my partner and I asked to be sitted inside. The staff that served us wasn't very happy as she sitted us outside. We ordered for Grilled lamb and Sirlion steak but instead of received Grilled Lamb we got smth else instead, my partner was starving so he just ate it. The steak was good and worth the amount paid for which was about $40. Everything else was not worth the price at all. The red house wine was terrible. I wouldn't recommend the restaurant
2
Went to this outlet since the one at Ann Siang was fully booked. It was a family dinner outing and other than the lovely setting overlooking the river, everything else turned out to be a damp squib. Service quality was very very basic, steak quality definitely very poor (The Ribeye was extremely stringy and the fat content too much). We had ordered for Medium rare and it wasnt done to perfection. Overall, it felt as if we were dining at a highway restaurant in the US. Value for money was also not very good. The housepour wine at 16++S$ was terrible
5
Lovely setting, excellent service, food was very tasty and well cooked, my very rare fillet steak melted in the mouth. Dessert options good and were well worth having
5
The environment around is awesome! Recommended! Good service with very polite staff! I would go again!
4
Great ambience because we had a table outdoor with a great view of the river. Food was great. Service was average as one of the waitresses seemed to have little knowledge of what's on the menu, hence unable to answer some of our questions.
4
Good but not great! The second time we went to the restaurant the Os A Moelle ( Beef Bone Marrow With Toast ) was served warm (not hot) and uncooked inside. We loved the Grilled Lamb Couscous. A good place with great ambiance for couples.
4
I ordered my steak to be charred on the outside and rare on the inside and got the waitress rudely rolling her eyes at me with the 'oh, another stupid Singaporean with a stupid order' look on her face. She thought I didn't see it but I did
4
The steak was really juicy and well grilled, was juicy with the surface grilled just nice to give that slight yummy crispy coating. the classic Parisian bistro decor to the authentic menu- every detail has been meticulously thought out and beautifully rendered. The waitstaff were attentive and the wine here - they have a great selection too. The price is reasonable as well. I would definitely return to try the rest of the dishes. Overall a great experience without French fries
2
Simple offering, poor execution. Les bouchons use to be a good option on Rob Quay but no longer. Staff don't care, they would not give you a table in a empty restaurant because they are fully booked (what you only use your table once per night?!!) and they can serve you cold meat without even being embarrassed
5
The staff were very very nice to have held our table. We had to revise our reservation from 7.30pm to 8pm and we were late because we had taken the bus to the wrong outlet. Staff were accommodating and v helpful. And we enjoyed our steak a lot. Will definitely recommend and return.
2
No service for 15 minutes, no bread basket, burnt steak, light fittings and air con units that have seen better days, confused wait staff. We’re not on to a great start are we? Well, the concept of this restaurant is good – limited menu serving simple food, done well. In this case, steak frites is the star menu item but unfortunately the restaurant’s standards are slipping very fast. This was my first time sitting indoors here and before I even looked at the menu, I noticed that the once-impressive chandelier above my head, was missing several light bulbs. It looked dreadful! Directly in my line of sight was an aircon unit that looked dusty and mouldy, quite frankly disgusting! Why did I stay on? Well, because I’d been here before and the food had been good on those occasions, so I thought I’d ignore the cosmetic aspects of the restaurant and look forward to a nice steak. Had a hard time getting a waiter’s attention and it was 15 minutes before I even got a glass of water. No matter, we proceeded to order our food. We then noticed that all the tables around us got a bread basket, but not us. We ordered fillet steaks, one of the best cuts on the menu, and when mine arrived (ordered to be cooked ‘medium’), it was so burnt it left a nasty aftertaste! I requested this to be changed as it was unpalatable and as is usual in Singapore, the waiter had to “check with the manager” first. The manager / Maitre D’ was very courteous and helped to fix the situation immediately, no questions asked. The frites were a different story altogether – greasy, limp, with a few burnt bits scattered in for good measure. And the salad? If you like soggy leaves drizzled in so much vinegar it would make you wince, then come here. It’s like the kitchen staff have completely lost their passion for cooking – this was such a miserable experience. Perhaps it’s time for the management and staff to take a break, shut the doors and overhaul everything about this restaurant
2
We have always been wanting to give this restaurant a shot and finally ended up here while talking a walk around the area. Service: nothing extraordinary.Food: average - definitely not worth the price. Most importantly, portions for the mains are just excessive and lead to a loads of wastage. Management should either rethink the portions or else inform the customers accordingly. We didn't find it worth at all. Better places in Robertson quay - you can give it a miss !
4
Ribeye steak medium rare was perfectly grilled. Portion is big. Well grilled, every bite has got flavour, meat was tender with good marbling of fat at the side.
Fries were home made and cut in-house, very tasty too.
3
The starters and desserts were good but I was disappointed with my steak. It was tough and very fatty, which I didn't expect for supposedly the house best. The fries were delicious though.
5
Fantastic.. Will definitely come again
Reservation was handled properly
Service was impeccable and the food was excellent.. Vigneron steak a definite recommendation
5
We had a lovely meal with friends & family the steaks were full of flavour & cooked to perfection! A great atmosphere with a great view & efficient staff.
3
Firstly I'd like to thank the manager Zach for being accommodating and giving us an indoor seat although the restaurant was fully booked on Christmas Eve. For the food, it's unfortunate that I was underwhelmed by it. Sirloin steak had too much fats in it, and the frites were limp. My salmon was too oily and I couldn't finish half of it. Our appetiser Os A Moelle (beef bone marrow) was extremely oily and it was a bit too heavy on the palette. Perhaps this is French cooking for you but for me, it wasn't the most pleasant eating experience. 2 mains with 1 appetiser came up to $115.
4
Have visited this restaurant many times.Our meal was very good and the service was of a good standard. The restaurant is very close to the river and you can choose between inside and outside.If you are after a good quality steak in Singapore, look no further
5
There are cheaper steaks, and there are better steaks for a lot more money. But in terms of best value for money for a mouthwatering steak, you can't go past Les Bouchons. With free flow fries, dinner rolls and a side salad, you don't need to even order an appetiser. Best choice, go with the extra-tender Beef Filet with the Blue Cheese sauce
3
The restaurant was ok and so was the service. I had the brochette of marinated lamb with salad and chips. It was passable, but nothing to rave about. Would not say this place is value for money. Love the look and the ambiance, the location by the river is lovely. Might be worth visiting for a nice drink by the river side
1
We had so much expectation from this place. However, food quality had dropped so much. We ordered cold cut and escargot as appetizers. Escargot was salty, fishy and oily. We ordered 1kg steak for 2 share. 1/3 of it was fats and bones that we couldn't eat! Our billed ended up to be $400. We will never come back!
4
Les Bouchons is always my choice of restaurant for good steak. This time I ordered the cote de boeuf for 3 pax (2 adult and 1 child) sharing. When the steak arrived, it was near perfect. As usual, the meat is tender and juicy, well grilled to medium to our delight. However, the meat around the bone is rare. Maybe, the next time I will request the bone to be well cook so I can bite on it. My kid feels that the fries should be crispier and that will be perfect
4
Although we waited for the table, the steaks were absolutely perfect.
The staff is far from perfect, but in the end is more than worth the visit
4
Quality of their steak is fantastic, though accompanied by a huge quantity of fries and over-vinegared salad. The chicken served with the Couscous Royale was dry but the rest of it was great.
4
Good job
Good service
Good day
Good mates
Nice air
Nice toilet
Nice food
When why must write so much chop?
5
Food took a while to come even though we were one of the earliest there. Other than that it was a lovely evening. Food tasted great and the service was just nice.
3
Service was great but food was just average. After reading the reviews I was looking forward to try but turn out to be just
4
Well-priced French steak and frites, Les Bouchons also throws the best Beaujolais Nouveau party on the river!
5
I use to spend some days in Singapore 2 times per year. The first evening when I need to resource myself, I'm going in this very pleasant place. I take a a huge surloin steak with home made frenc fries.When I'm living, I'm full and relax
4
Went to Les Bouchons chiefly for its couscous royal n it turned out to be excellent. Meat is tender n merguez is very tasty. Brought us back to Quartier Latin in Paris, while we're just here in Singapore! Only missing some French musics to suit the ambianc
1
Poor service, due to poorly trained staff, our waiter couldn't remember who ordered what from the aperitif drinks to the deserts. We ordered a 150$ red wine bottle but they couldn't serve it in proper red wine glasses (we had some kind of enhanced water or white wine glasses instead). Salad was over vinegared and when finally the meat came, we were relieved because it was the only enchantment of our dinner, quickly spoiled as the staff told us that there will be no free flow of salad, while it was very clearly written on the menu (they called it a misunderstanding!) Last, avoid the brownie for desert, it had barely no chocolate taste, was served with a very average industrial vanilla ice cream, and was way over cooked.
3
Heard and read reviews that the steak from this place was one of the best. However, I was a little disappointed as a birthday dinner turned out to be one of the most unforgettable experience. There was a fly or mosquito flying around inside the restaurant and service was bad.The steak is not too bad and the portion is huge but the salad and cold fries were disappointing
4
We sat outside on tables right on the rive front, very nice environment for a relax, people watch and quite for conversation to easily be heard.
4
The steaks were not bad. Could improve on the fries though (they went cold pretty quickly).
Has a good selection of wine to go with your steak.
5
Situated on th Singapore river, great steak and the wines not bad too, although the wine is S$12.50 a glass (£6) , rib eye steak £17 ish. You can ay £25 for entrecôte. Had a lovely night, staff are friendly and helpful.
3
This was our second visit to the restaurant, and I must say that the first one was better. The service was good up to the point that we were seated, then we felt forgotten about. The French manager is wonderful, but the staff not so much. For some reason, we had fruit flies buzzing around our table. The first time we told a server, he just waled away looking confused. The French manager later brought a bottle of Febreeze (wonder how thats going to counter the flies), sprayed that around the table and left, apologising profusely. In the end, we got a table outside.The food takes a very long time to arrive. It's good for a lengthy meal, but if you want to have dinner in an hour and be out of there, this is not the place to be.The steaks are very value for money, and the wine selection is good for the price you pay, but the quality of the steaks isn't really the best. But what more could you expect for $40?We had the bone marrow to start with, and while it was buttery and delicious, it was a tad under seasoned. It needed a squeeze of lemon to cut through it's richness.Desserts were good, and one friend commented that he would come back just for dessert, not for the mains.Would we go back? Yes. Because you won't find more value for money steaks anywhere short of making them yourself. The restaurant looks more expensive than it is, which is always a plus in my book.
2
This was the third or fourth visit to the restaurant but unfortunately on this occasion we did not enjoy our meal due to the poor quality and toughness of the steak. We complained and were offered a complimentary dessert which we did not want. We asked for a reduction on the bill and were refused so ended up taking the steaks home for the dog who seemed to enjoy them. This was a special occasion with a visiting relative and was very disappointing. We will not go again.  
5
We made reservations through Chope and I highly recommend it. We had originally put in a request for indoor seating but all requests are not guaranteed. When we arrived, we were told that our reservation came in after all indoor tables were booked. Looking around I could see why. The inside of the restaurant was tiny. They were wonderful at finding us a seat outside and although it was a particularly hot night, they had fans outside which kept us comfortable. Turns out that it was more enjoyable sitting outside by the bustling River. I'll make outdoor reservations next time. The service was knowledgeable and attentive. We had a wonderful evening and the food was delicious and reasonably priced. I look forward to our next visit and will be using Chope reservations again
4
We were craving the famous steak frites and were excited to find Les Bouchons. The welcome was efficient, but not overly warm. The server was very knowledgeable and helpful in making recommendations. The food was faultless and the portions were ample, so we were not able to take advantage of the offer of bottomless chips...and the chips are fantastic. Our only slight gripe is that they close after lunch at 2PM. We will definitely be back
3
The steak is what they are famous for, and they can do that well and for a decent price ($38). However, the fries are below par, with perhaps only one slightly crispy chip out of 10. Entrées are average. Stay away from the house wine ($12), which is really not potable. Average service.There are more vibrant places in Singapore where you can have a good steak, and accompany that with decent entrées and wine
1
Our visit got off to a bad start when on arrival instead of a warm welcome we were told wait there I will check your booking. Service was poor the food worse. The staff made no attempt to be friendly or welcoming, they performed their work as if we were a necessary evil rather than a valued customer.My wife ordered Rib Eye medium to well, the meat arrived black on the outside cooked past well done, dry and tough. We passed this along to the waiter who in fairness offered to replace it but it took so long to attract the attention of the staff that my wife didn't wish to wait for another. There was no further attention from the staff other than to ask if we wanted more to drink.It was my first visit I certainly won't be visiting again. I prefer not to feel like an intruder.
4
Used to go to the Ann Siang restaurant every Saturday without fail when we lived in Singapore, but always found the Rive Gauche restaurant (despite the setting) a step or two off the pace. However, was back in town last week with my son (14), and we visited the riverside version Saturday night along with a friend. It may have helped that the excellent Ann Siang manager happened to be at the riverside version for a week (and recognized us from a few years ago), but our food was absolutely outstanding, as was the whole evening. Usual starters included smoked salmon and terrine de maison, but it was the filets that killed it...absolutely delicious, and perfectly cooked. Desserts were completely unnecessary...so we had them anyway. Only reason it's not 5* is the prices these days..and even that's a little unfair since it's the same story all over Singapore. Absolutely terrific
5
went on a weekday, it was a nice and quiet place for a romantic dinner with my so. had the signature steak and fries and it was fantastic! service staff were polite and friendly. would wanna visit this place again!
3
Arrived on time for 7:30pm booking. We were acknowledged by the Maitre'd however he stated he would be back.A couple of mins later one of the waiting staff approached us to enquire if he could help. We stated we had a reservation for 7:30pm in the name given at the time of booking. He checked and confirmed our details and directed us to our table.Our waitress was pleasant, but seemed to be in a terrible rush.Having delivered menus were were asked shortly afterwards if we were ready to order. I know its a simple menu, but we had come out for a nice relaxing meal, not really what one has come to expect of Les Bouchon.We placed our order for main courses, we had already decided to skip the starters, and shortly afterwards the salads arrived along with cold bread rolls.This is something that both branches have continued to fail on for a good few years. Originally the rolls were served warm, now it appears one has to request them to be warmed once they have been delivered.Shortly afterwards the main courses arrived a. Both steaks were cooked as ordered, medium rare, and medium. I must compliment this branch on their frites - They are out of this world!!!! A lot better than the Ang Siang Hill branch where the fries always seem to have been cooked and are reheated under a grill which results in rock hard frites.From start to finish, including settling the bill, 57 mins!!'Finally someone has come up with a Fast Food version of Steak & Frites!!!!!!!!Overall, not the type of evening my wife and I were expecting.The frites were Tres Bon, but I doubt very much we will not be returning to this branch.Service - 7/10Service Speed - 11/10Frites 10/10 Ang Siang Hill Frites (4/10

Hi everyone,  My friend who is living in Singapore was trying to book a table for my venue with my family but it seems to be a "tourist trap!" We asked a booking for 14peoples, they called me to inform that we have to pay minimum charges 150SGD which is around 100USD for a steak and fries???? Couldn't be serious? Even we take many bottles of red wine but seriously for 14 people it is a LOT! I am disappointed of the reaction of the owner. Is that not too greedy to take advantage of tourist in this way? There is a lot of restaurants in Singapore, we found a great one in Duxton Hill "l'entrecote" with charming chophouse in the area so we did our booking without any problem
4
Great location just by the river, had steak with fries (free flow but did not ask for seconds as it is a lot.). Was served bread as a starter accompanied by salad. Salad was good however the bread is disappointing as it is cold and hard, making it hard to chew. The steak however was amazing. Kudos to the steak. Service is prompt and attentive. Overall was a great experience despite the rock-hard bread
1
Me and my fiance tried to find this restaurant for like half an hour and we could not find it. Probably they have closed down? we went to Vino Rosso instead and it was a good substitute
3
That about sums up my experience at Les Bouchons last Friday. While I was happy that they did not scrimp on the portion of the salmon, the fish didn't taste very fresh and it was quite oily when it was supposed to be grilled. Same with the salad that came with the dish. At least my husband enjoyed his steak which he said was pretty good and well prepared. Service was good and efficient. Located at Robertson Quay, the restaurant has a lovely view of the river that runs next to it. On Fridays, the area usually comes alive with people looking to welcome the weekend properly with good food and some drinks
4
We ate here on our second night in Singapore prior to flying out to Lombok the next day. Having spent a long day walking several miles with a few liquid refreshment stops, we were in need of a hearty meal and opted for Les Bouchons in Robertson Quay. The steak was very good with plenty of chips and a pleasant half carafe of red wine. Unsurprisingly it was quite expensive but par for the course in Singapore considering the location
3
I little piece of beef, perfectly cooked served with burned, soft French fries and a good salad for S$44.The piece of beef was probably worth S$20. They are super proud of their homemade French Fries, but looks like no one knows how to make the best of it.No, I am not recommending this restaurant
1
Sorry - bad experience. I asked for a medium rare entrecote. The 400g entrecote was just overcooked - like a shoe - and the general manager claimed it was not. Very arrogant attitude, bad discussion, and bad overall experience. Don't go here if you appreciate a good piece of meet
4
Had the chance to go for a team dinner during a working trip. Was staying at the Gallery hotel and this restaurants is right there at Robertson Quay. Brilliant ambiance to begin with. Excellent food - recommend the steak for sure. Look forward to going back for another round soon
4
delicious meat with the vigneron butter, french fries excellent, large choice of famous wine...
staff members so friendly
4
Not sure why so many Singapore restaurants are focused on serving French fries, albeit they are "French".... I had the Filet which was excellent, and the only other thing on my plate was a huge pile of fries, which just did not seem appropriate.
4
French style and taste, steaks of the fine art, great fries, sitting inside cool or outside a bit warmer, hip environment, wonderful appetizers, you name it. Add friendly service, pay for the value you get and you will leave the place feeling good and satisfied. I went there with friends and we just enjoyed it
1
I ordered lamb kebabs and friends ordered steaks. A friend (French) complained his steak was overdone and an Asian friend complained her steak was overdone but their steak was still edible as they asked for rare and they gave them medium. My lamb was over done as well, I asked for medium. Also The lamb kebabs had big nerves that made eating it unpleasant as can't chew on the nerves. All the fries served were brown and inedible. A total let down.. They have a French floor manager who is absolutely friendly and nice but he has to be tough with his kitchen to reject food that looks inedible if no one cares and customers feedback! Definitely a place where I am not sure if anyone takes pride in their work.. What a pity. It has a decent bistro feel. Don't attempt , not worth it.

Good ol steak frites much like you would expect in a good cafe in a major European city. Service was attentive without being over bearing. Make sure you sit outside if possible as the inside has exactly zero atmosphere. Dont both with the beef from Normandy just get the regular sirloin with fries and a side you like and off you go. Enjoy

One of the best, if not THE best filet steak I have had the pleasure of devouring anywhere in the world! And the never ending supply of beautifully cooked chips was very welcome, as they were so good also. A favourite restaurant of my Son who eats there regularly and I could really understand why on this evening's evidence. Yes, I can agree that there is little to commend the restaurant interior. If atmosphere is your priority then Les Bouchons is probably not for you but if you are looking for, possibly, the best steak in Singapore then you have to try Les Bouchons Rive Gauche (if you'll pardon my french!)

Came here with my family and although it was a bit pricey the food was very good. The steak was tender and had lots of flavours, but definitely come for the chips. They were very crunchy, like they were deep fried three times, and they have unlimited friesIf your in Singapore, and your in need of something french or something else besides Asian, come to Les bouchons, and you also get a great vie

Been going very regularly at Les Bouchons, every time I crave for a simple but very efficient meal. The "steak frites" is just excellent. Served perfectly grilled, withe a nut of butter atop. The french fries are home made, not these frozen stuff served in most restaurants. Sauces are the immortal mayonnaise and bÃ©arnaise. As a starter they serve you a well balanced green salad with wholenuts. They could do a little bit better with the wine per glass's quality. Nice terrace which brings the perfect atmosphere to share a simple dinner, at a very reasonable price, with some friends. An excellent ratio quality/price which never deceive

I have tried many steak houses in singapore but this one is definitely my favorite.The meat is delicious and so are the fries (if you like them overfried)and all of this at a reareasonable price for singaporeTheir outdoor tables have a nice atmosphere, but it's very bland inside so get an outside table

Overlooking the upper reaches of the river on Robertson Quay this restaurant offers good value for simple food, well-prepared. Three of us had steak and chips, one had lamb and sausage kebabs and chips. With a bottle of wine and other drinks the bill as 75$S each, or about 38GBP

Set in a French style Brasserie along Singapore river, a restaurant that offers very high quality meat dishes prepared to perfection.
Service is professional and very pleasant
Wine list offers good value wines.

Unfortunately, it was not. I have tried the little sister in Club St a couple of times and that. Has been pretty good. Tried the special. EntrecÃ´te from Normandy but it disappointed. It was big, way too big but had no taste. Taste is the most important thing with steak. Wine was good and good value. Starters were also pretty good. Great if you like people watching but be careful with your choice....

I have been here before, but stopped by again last night for a steak, together with a client. We took a table outside, to soak in the atmosphere of the Singapore river. The menu is short, but the food is well executed and geared towards steaks. I had a rib eye steak and my colleague had lamb skewers, both of which came with a mixed salad served beforehand. I ordered my steak rare, and it came just as ordered. We were debating whether to have a starter, but I am glad we didn't because the portions are generous. Fries came as "free-flow", which is a bit of a gimmick, because I don't know anyone who has actually finished the first portion! The wine list contains a selection of good wines under S$100 a bottle. Dinner for two with a bottle of good red wine was just under Sin$200, which in Singapore is pretty reasonable value for what you get.I recommend this place for anyone looking for a good, honest steak in a relaxing setting

After three days of mostly asian food, a colleague and I decided we wanted red meat. This restaurant has quite a small interior but plenty of space outside.Staff were attentive, steaks were fine. My rib eye was a bit too fatty so a fair amount of waste. My colleague had an entrecote which didn't look like it had been rested properly because there was plenty of blood on the plate by the time he was done. But he seemed happy enough.The bottle of wine we had was fine but expensive. Overall, fine, but not outstanding given their prices

This place is located under Singapore Tyler Print Institute and was a real surprise. I was really satisfied by the size of the steaks (300g) and the chips (free flow) were excellent. Nice location on the river, but they need to look at reducing their corkage. $30 a bottle and the cheapest wine on the menu is a average drop. We sat outside and the fans were just right

Les Bouchons' Restaurant at the River is in a nice location and the outside seating is just great (when it does not rain). Indoor lacks the ambiance of the Ann Siang location and is just too bright and without atmosphere. The food is similar, or is it just the ambiance that makes China Town the better steak? Good quality of meat and fries, a good selection of affordable french wines, but the service could be more attentive and is not that personal

Me and my husband visited the restaurant whilst on honeymoon. We'd just arrived in Singapore and we came across the restaurant on a walk by the river. The waitress quickly organised a table for us, gave us menus and took our drinks order. The menu does not offer a huge list of choice but the 'steaks and fries' dishes that are available, left me with a tough decision, they all sounded delicious! we ordered starters which were lovely but when the main courses arrived I wished we'd not had them as the portion was huge. The rib eye steak although about the same price you'd expect to pay in the uk was twice the size and perfectly cooked to my request of medium rare. Then the fries... I don't know how they cooked them but they were the best fries I've ever had! A whole mountain of them and they were 'free flowing' ...the waitress actually asked if I wanted more! All in all we left very satisfied, the perfect start to our 3 night visit to Singapore. The staff made sure our glasses were topped up all night and were very polite and friendly. The only negative I will mention is that the tables are very close together so its not somewhere to dine if you want privacy but other than that I would recommend it to anyone in Singapore

A wonderful setting, a simple but effective menu... Don't expect what they are not selling. It's not a romantic fine dining place. It's a great place to have fun with friends or with your family! Everything on the menu is as it should be done! Go on weekends and enjoy their couscous! Go any other day and you won't be disappointed! An address to keep in mind!

Had a dinner for 5 on Satrurday night.Service was professional and attentive and the food was very good.I had the Escargots followed by a half share of a cote de boeuf. All very good and priced highly but reasonably. None of my fellow diners had any complaints with their respective dishes.Tips - be careful with you appetizer size and the amount of bread you eat. Leave room for your main course!ProsAwesome french bread and authentic butter (a rarity in Singapore)Very good serviceFree flow chipsConsFree flow chips (don't overeat!!)Portion sizes are very larg

Went with friends for a birthday celebration, well, without the birthday cake thingy.It was my first visit, not knowing what to expect. But the reviews on this site says great stuff!The food was by far, just average. We have had better, but one certainly can't expect much for a S$46++ prime rib for 2! starters were below average, escargot had too much oil, the salads which came with the rib were full of mustards, fries were great as it was served hot. Skip the desert if you can, totally forgettable.Took about 30 mins for the main to arrive, we ordered 3 sets of prime ribs with various done-ness and an additional main to share, we were given fries enough to feed 10. We are well aware that the fries are free flow but the servers seemed to be conditioned in such a way that all accompanying fries need to be served with the mains, regardless if the table was overcrowded for more plates or for this case, baskets of fries. My point is, if the fries are free flow, come as when it is required, they do not need to arrive at the table with the main when there were more then enough fries. The servers do not seem to understand it, and they seem to be constantly under pressure, not sure why but they all look indifferent and definitely not too happy to be working there. They were amateurish at best, and didn't know what to recommend or even to caution if we have over ordered, which we did!The restaurant was full but i am not sure if it was just me, it was terribly hot and stuffy in their, definitely not a pleasant atmosphere. While the prime ribs looks pretty reasonable on the menu (S$48++ for 2 persons), the total bill didn't tell us that, it was close to S$600 for 6 persons. To be fair, other that the 3 prime ribs, we had king prawns (S$40++), a bottle of wine (S$105++), 2 coffees, a scoop of ice cream, escargots, caprese and creme brulee. OK, this was a case of us over ordering, just a note to self not to repeat it if i am to come back here, or try their better outlet on Club Street. (By the way, we came to Robertson Quay as Club Street was fully booked)Tip for those who wants to visit, the rib is big enough for 3 or even 4 if you are a small eater. The fries should be sufficient to let you walk out of the restaurant feeling full
