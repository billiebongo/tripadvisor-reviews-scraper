Pizzas is pretty good to go with a cold beer. View isn’t to bad can watch the world go by. Good place to pitch pre water show.

I had a Singapore Sling in the place. It was ok, price and quality on average. The nice thing about the place is the view and the sight offered by the bay.

Visited today! The views outside are great. The food was nice! But shocked how 2 sandwiches and 1/2 a pint of San Miguel was $42! Over €10 of that was added as a service charge! Rip off!!

We were looking for a quality easy casual meal .It took us by surprise it was just what we wanted . A bottle of Shaw & Smith Sauvignon Blanc Meat lovers Pizza and a flavoursome burger chips and salad .We popped in another night for a pure blonde - glass of Vas Felix dry white and shared an open top grilled Hawaiian ham cheese pineapple sandwich.Even though is naughty food it was nicely prepared and taste was spot on , staff were excellent. A full bar and a great view of the nightly light show when the renovations out the front are complete

Good quality food and great location, very friendly and helpful staff, drinks were nice and cold and the fish and chips and burgers were cooked perfectly, like most places at the Marina Bay Sands it was getting up there price wise, we had 4 burgers and fries and 1 fish and chips and a drink each - all up nearly $200 SGD, very nice food though

After staying in the outer part of the city for a week, myself and my partner had been really disappointed in the service (or lack there of) we had received at other places we’d frequented during our week long stay from Australia. We’d stopped by Dallas cafe for dinner and a few drinks is and was greeted with the best service we had received in Singapore. It was so refreshing to know that customer service was still important!! (Especially to me), and given the 10% service charge is automatically added in Singapore, you kinda expect at least a moderate greeting - which we’d not received prior to dining at Dallas. The cocktails were delicious (and strong!), moderately priced (about $14) and the burger and fish and chips were great. We had a great view by the water (and of the laser/water show) and would recommend for a stop in for others.

After a culinary journey to the 2 of the celebrity restaurants at the Shoppes Mall, we decided to check out Dallas Cafe & Bar which was nicely located outside of the luxurious mall, with a full view the awesome 'Light and Water Show,' it's kind of an American-style bar and food. Not disappointed with the ordered food, appetizing lamb burger and fish tacos and good french fries, had also the best fudge brownie sundae prepared by the friendly and accomodating Kay, good service at that! Highly recommend Dallas Cafe & Bar for casual lunch or dinner

After visiting Gardens by the Bay I decided to check out the places here at the Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands. Given the location you should expect it to be expensive...& it is. But look where you are and the stores around you: some one has to pay for all this! The spot has a partial view of the inner harbour and downtown core with some huge palm trees providing shade. There is an indoor section and an outdoor section. Theses are separated by glass panels that were open on my visit. The tables were all high tops and stretched out onto the promenade. I needed cooling down so I sat inside at the bar under the air conditioning vent and ceiling fan. The bartenders and waiters worked as a team and everyone checked on me. They have a great selection of drinks that they craft for you-see the menu. I stuck to San Miguel draught lager but could watch the tenders in action. They make some awesome cocktails! I wanted lunch so I grabbed a menu. The food selection is not that huge, but there is something for everyone. I chose the fish & chips. It turned out to be the best I’ve had to date in Singapore. Fries were exceptional as was the fish...even the cole slaw was great. So I guess I differ with most reviews on the food here. If you’re looking for a casual American style bar with familiar food, I’d have to highly recommend Dallas Cafe-please don’t be shocked by the prices-after all this is Marina Bay Sands! Cheers..

Walking around Singapore on my last day, which was sunny and very hot, and decided to stop here for a beer. Much quieter on this side of the marina outside of the huge shopping mall in front of the Marina Bay Sands hotel. Places are a bit more stylish too. Service was good as was the pint of Stella. Shaded seating too just by the open doors and a good view across the water
