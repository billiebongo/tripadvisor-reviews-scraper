We ate here this afternoon and found the food to be tasty. The various pasta dishes ordered were tomatoey and the pizza was lovely.
With the breeze, dining outside was really pleasant.
Would definitely come here again.

A great selection of pasta dishes and our choice of Linguine al Funghi was exceptional. The flavour was mouthwatering good. Being street food there were no drinks or desserts but we would come here again.

good place to have a quick meal. You get pizzas soup and pasta.. It is bang on main road and ideal place for shoppers to have a meal. Overall good place to have lunch /dinner at reasonable price.

The food was horrible and with no taste at all. We ordered 6 sets of baked rice and those were the worst baked rice I have eaten so far. The service is also horrible . You have to go to the cashier and then make payments and then collect your drinks and pretty much you have to do everything except for cooking

Pastamania had many italian options. We ordered baked rice with mushroom and veg pizza ..an apple basilica with a nutty chocolatta pizza for dessert...The dinner was good...The dessert took about 20 minutes to get to our table...But the wait was worth it..Price is a little high as compared to the portions offered by other restaurants...Enjoy a tasty meal here.

Was surprised after so long not coming to this outlet and found out they changed the concept of being the "FRESCA" type of branch instead of the normal outlets.Food choices was limited, more expensive especially the drinks, and desserts choices was a letdown which both my kids favorite was not in the menu. Guess will be the first and last to visit this oultet

My friend's family and I decided to take our dinner at Pastamania near Summerset. The price indeed and I chose the Seafood Marinara. Though a little bit sour because of the tomato sauce, I highly recommend it for Pasta lover. I really enjoy the food and it's tasty. They have variety of Pasta to choose from. :
