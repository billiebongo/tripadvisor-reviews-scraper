Some of the dishes here (dry spicy paneer & chicken manchurian) are excellent. Reasonably priced. Also try the hot and sour soup and yang show rice.

Been to Mayura quite a number of times. Quality of food has only been better. There are various dishes to try and you can walk out of the restaurant satisfied. A little pricey but worth the cost for sure. Love the ambience too.

A medium sized place at 723 East Coast Road,Singapore. Decor is simple just plain clean place .Advertise themselves as " Authentic Indian -Chinese & Exclusive Indian Cuisine,,".We ordered Hakka Noodles,chilli and sezewan chicken . The food was good and tasty .Worth trying at least once

We went there with a big group of friends last week and i must say the service was pretty quick for a group of 15 of us.The Indo chinese food was excellent and on special request 'msg' is also not added to the food, only you ask !!!!The North indian food is ok ok but definately a must visit if you are an Indo-chinese food fan!The ambience is fairly average but the food quality overrules it.Overall, a restaurant i will definitely visit more than once for its good food

We went to this restaurant with my god family in Singapore. This is my first time with Indian food with Chinese style it was very delicious and good taste ever. The staff there and GM of the restaurant very friendly and helpful. After dinner we had homemade ice scream that very amazing. Highly recommend this restaurant to all travelers, very good value for money

Not sure what the fuss is about this place, with so many ppl raving about it as the best Chindian food this side of town. I went there with my family (4 adults and 3 kids) and ordered some classic Chindian dishes - Chk. Manchurian, Garlic Chicken, Manchow Soup, Hakka Noodles etc. The food was served after a not short wait; but we were not complaining. However the food itself was very mediocre in taste. We ended up over-ordering, in our enthusiasm and ended up doggy-bagging some of the stuff. Ate it the next day and discovered that age did nothing to improve the taste. On the plus side, the portions were generous. Service was good. Cost us around 32$ per person; which IMHO was completely unjustified by the taste

Among the best Pepper Chilli Paneer in town? Authentic Indian Spicy Chinese food? Mayura is the place.Honestly, this place doesn’t deserve to be so low in ranking here. We have been fan of this place for Indian version of Chinese food. It has spices, it is spicy and the dish distinctly serves what it should.Reaching here is a troublesome task unless you drive or always hooked on Taxi. Bedok mrt is the nearest and from there a bus. One of the main reasons we don’t go very often.This time we were surprised that the restaurant has added Thai dishes also. Though we just tried Thai Mango salad in Thai and it was good. Pepper Chilli Paneer, Chicken lollipop were mind blowing. Everyone loved it including kids. Vegetable Manchurian and Schz friend rice were good. Make sure to specify your spice level. Medium spicy should be good.Things to highlight is the portion size, it is on a higher side on a comparative basis. Order less and gradually order more if it is not sufficient. Reasonably priced. Ambience is average, no frill, nothing eye-catchy.Presentation could be improved. Servers are helpful, service was okay. But after having such a awesome spicy food, you would want to forget everything and just drool over it. Go with a good mood, have Chinese dishes, I am sure you would enjoy

Mayura turned out to be a great experience for Indian Chinese and Thai food. On top of it all, the service was really good. Go for it!

Mayura serves the best Indian food I've tasted in Singapore! Their crispy spinach dish is a really good starter! Do not give this restaurant a miss if you're staying in the East!

I went to Mayura along with my wife as we were craving for Indian Chinese dishes. We went to the place because Indian Wok, where we actually wanted to go to, was full and we had to find an alternative. Glad we went to this place. The staff was courteous. The menu had a lot of choices. We ordered Corn Salt and Pepper, chicken Manchurian and egg fried rice which was all good and more than enough for two of us. However, we ended up paying ~SG$50 which is quite expensive by any standard. Anyways worth going once in a while

Mayura has the kind of atmosphere that might be endearing for some, or might be annoying for others. It is set out like a formal restaurant, there`s no dress code, it`s very family friendly, and serves Indian-Chinese food. In short, Mayura has the vibe of most middle-end Indian-Chinese restaurants. The service was good, but a bit slow. The waitress was nice, and served us with efficiency. There was nothing remarkable about the service, apart from its slight slowness. The service was basically average. Most of the food was priced more or less around the benchmark of mid-range Indian restaurants in Singapore, but some dishes were more expensive. All dishes came in reasonable serving sizes, a relief due to their prices. The one dish which was absolutely fabulous was the Chilly Paneer starter. It had a crispy skin, but was still soft on the inside. It was not spicy to the point of overpowering, and other ingredients could be tasted. Each paneer piece was a nice, big one, which made it easy to spear with a fork and eat. The Chilly Paneer is certainly the best I have had till now. In conclusion, a must-try in Mayura is the Chilly Paneer starter. Mayura is slightly more expensive than the average rate, but the serving sizes are reasonable. Service is decent, but a bit slow. The restaurant is very family friendly, but is still done up in a very formal style. This place is worth a visit, in my opinion

The place is along the east coast and among the many eateries over there this one is worth trying for.. The starters are mouth-watering and yes since you overeat (like we did) the main menu you won't find so yum ! So better is to have starters less :) The ambience is well maintained and yes a place for Indian food it is. A must visit if you are staying near east coast or even close by

Food - Food is tasty. Has decent vegetarian options. Some items very a bit spicy for us. But overall tasted good.Ambience - The ambience is very good. Not very noisy even on weekends also. Plays perfect music.Service - Customer service is very good. They also helped in booking a return cab for us

- Good Ambience- Indian Chinese , Punjabi Food and Thai Food- Innovative Menu- Excellent Chinese Starters - Crackling Spinach, Crispy Babycorn, Pepper Chilli Paneer, etc.- Mains are also good including Thai.- Restricted but Decent Vegetarian options for Indian Restaurant.- Portions are big
3
We were a group of 6 adults and 3 children. The ambience is decent being a casual dining place and the cleanliness standards are acceptable too. Ordered 3 types of soups, 2-3 types of starters, few cocktails and liquor as well as 2 main course dishes. The preparation was typical of an indian Chinese chef with nothing much to complain about, but, no wow factor as well. Few issues we highlighted...the bread crumbs were not fresh, a main course dish with fish was not well prepared. The staff was also quite stretched and not too friendly. Overall, a decent place for a change, but, not something to crave for

We were a group of 5 families. One of the dishes ordered was Schezwan Fried Rice. Since there were so many of us, we realised half way thru that the rice serves was vegetable fried rice and the schezwan fried rice. We called the manager ( dont remember his name ) and he said that it was vegetable friend rice that we had ordered and not the schezwan fried rice. I was doubly sure as the waitress had confirmed the order to me and in fact that was the first dish that was ordered. I asked the manager whether he confirmed with the waitress and he was like yes, we are aware that the order was for veg fried rice. At this point , he asked us curtly that sice we have finished half portion of the rice, whether we wanted to place a /new' order for the schezwan fried rice. I happened to see the waitress who had initially noted the orders from us. I called her at the same time and asked her what was our order..whether it was veg fried rice or schezwan fried rice...She confirmed that our order was Schezwan fried rice and she had more idea about customer service. So she said the dish would be replaced. To my utter dismay, they still billed for the veg fried rice. Only on specifically mentioning about the same, they removed it from the bill. From the look of it, i guess they wanted to just bill and see whether we accepted

I like their american choupsey and garlic noodles with manchurian or stir fry.
On indian food side I would recommend only dal and paneer (we are vegetarians).
Value for money place.

Food was great and amazing. It wasn't spicy yet tasty. Nice Ambience.
However a word of caution - the sizzles are not good though and it takes quite some time (25 min) to get served.
5
My wife always avoided indian food but I managed to persuade her to try Mayura one evening. Suffice it to say that this turned into our favourite restaurant in Singapore, both for dine in and take away. The northern Indian menu with Chinese influences is interesting and very tasty. Initially we just told the waiter what we liked or didn't like and he would just send out some different dishes and a couple of these dishes became our favourites - we have tried some at other restaurants and they just don't stack up.Reasonably priced and very clean premises make this a nice place to eat as well.It does get very busy from about 8:30pm onwards so get in early if you haven't booked
5
My family and I went down to Mayura for dinner on the 19th. Mr Lingam was very friendly and approachable. He recommended dishes that were definitely worth the buy. The sizzler tofu and mushroom with cheese was really good!The staff were polite and friendly. We loved the ambience to. Our desert was the brownie with the ice cream and it is probably one of the best I've ever eaten. Would definitely recommend to my friends and family. Definitely worth the cost! Great job Mayura

We stay at the east coast and have visited mayura couple of time. The quality of food is not only good but the quantity is also sufficient enough for one person. Recently we ordered catering from mayura for our daughters birthday. The quantity they gave was more than we asked for and food was piping hot and tasty. Spices and all just right as demanded. Mr.lingam restaurant manager helped me to design the menu according to my criteria with affordable price. The table set up and all was very neatly and well organized and laid. I would strongly recommend mayura if anybody planning for catering. Cheers

One of the most terrible north indian food I had in Singapore. overly priced. For sure no value for money. staff is arrogant, no customer service attitude and they take ages to serve your food. I do not understand why restaurants want to serve a cuisine that they are not capable fo serving
2
Ordered the Szechuan vegetarian fried rice, sizzling tofu, Red curry and gobi manchurian. Everything was bland, the red curry was thick, had too much coconut milk and it was green. It was a red curry that was green. Staff even tried to say that it's more authentic when the red curry is green, it was just pathetic. Food took over 45 minutes from order to when it was being served and ours wasn't the only table experiencing slow service. First time and last time visiting this awful restaurant

We used Mayura Catering services for a work function in the function room where we live. We live in the Singapore CBD so around Raffles Quay. The response in terms of the menu etc was handled quite well with responses received promtly for enquiries. The food was very good no complaints in this department ... Presentation was very good as well.Here are a few points I thought to share where they could improve their service. The delivery and setup was approx 2 hours late! The delivery and setup of the food was arranged fo 5:45pm as our function was starting at 6:30pm. At 5:30 the delivery personnel contacted us and told us that they were at our condo so we told them to make their way to our function room. The exact details of where the function room was located was clearly stated on the invoice. At 6pm there was no sign of them. We contacted them and they said they were here and trying to get to the function room, my husband asked them exactly where they were but they could not give us their exact location. We were simply told we are here and getting a pass from the security desk. My son went to look for them but there was no sign of them. We called them at least 6 times and everytime we were told we will be there shortly. At 6:20pm my husband went looking for them, he walked around the vicinity of our condo. He spotted them approx 500m away at an office building trying to access the building. My husband pointed them in the right direction and they arrived at our condo function room at 6:45pm. At this time our guests were already here. This was a work function for my husband but he was not at the function room to greet the guests as he was out looking for the catering people. Setup took place one hour after the scheduled time. The food could only be consumed at 7:30 as it needed to be heated up again due to it being in the Catering van for at least 2hours door-to-door. As a consequence one vegetable dish was very dry and guests did not eat this and we had to throw it. The reason that the catering personnel were late in their words was 'that they were at our condo but the security officer told them that this was not the right condo'. The invoice address was very specific so I don't see how the security officers could have led them astray. Especially as we had told the conceirge at the security desk that we were expecting catering to be delivered to the function room. We are most disappointed in the manner of the delivery of the food. I would suggest to Mayura Catering Management that if they are unfamiliar with where to deliver the catering then they should do a look see to make sure they know exactly where the food is to be delivered instead of driving around looking for the address with the food sitting in their van .... not very professional on their part. We were also very disappointed as our guests had arrived but there was no food and they had to witness the caterers setting up the food etc . Most definitely doesn't reflect positively on the company providing the catering ... in this case Mayura. I was also disappointed in the quality of the crockery and cutlery that was provided by Mayura. The standard was that which you find in Hawkers Centres. I would suggest that either provide cutlery and crockery of a higher standard or don't include this in your price. I was actually quite embarrassed with what was provided. Had the setup happened when it should have I would have come down to my apartment and taken better plates and cutlery to be used. But as the food was nearly 2 hours late and my guests needed to eat I was not in a position to change the crockery and cutlery. Our function was on a Saturday and I waited until Tuesday to see if Mayura would contact us about the late delivery and setup of the food. I did not hear from Mayura so I did contact them to give them feedback of their Catering services. Mayura's response was that 'our security had led the delivery personnel astray'. We live in a very popular condo in the CBD and there are functions in our Function Room every weekend. There is absolutely no way that security would have done that. The delivery personnel would have needed to show the invoice and the address was clearly stated there - so no confusion there. They said they did and were told that this is not the address ... highly unlikely.Mayura: Take ownership of your mistake.  Conduct a look see of the premises of the function prior to the day so as to ensure setup is done before guests arrrive - this leaves a good impression for both the host and the Catering Company. Change your crockery and cutlery.I would be very hesitant to use Mayura again ..

Very consistent in quality and taste. Tom yam seafood soup was tangy, paneer tikka was fresh and just rightly spiced. Schezwan rice and black bean fish were yum.Even the veg options were good. Ended with sizzling brownie and rasmalai, just ok nothing great though.Good prompt service

Seems there has been some big changes lately which aren't working in their favour. We used to be regular there and found the food quality food and consistent always. However this visit was a disappointment. Did quality was pretty average and you could get better fare at most of the other restaurants in Little India at less than half the price. The service staff was good just as before but it seems the Cook has changed and they have hiked the prices.

Average Indian but good Indian chinese food. Indian curries were bit tasteless but Indian Chinese food was almost like home
3
It was ok not bad just had a wait because it is both Indian and continental and because other Thai and Chinese restaurants closed early because of Chinese New Years it good busy otherwise food is good
4
Nice ambience, great food, good service.
Indian Chinese fusion food was great.. Loved the Cauliflower manchurian and pepper chili fish.
4
I really liked all food we have ordered here especially the hot chocolate cake with chocolate sauce.But my friends found the restaurant to be costly
4
Tried couple of dishes.. Dry Cauliflower Manchurian for starter. Great taste.Then Szechwan Noodles for main course. We took the vegetarian one and asked to add eggs. Pretty good food. Enough portion for 2. Good Service.
Costed around 30 dollars.

Went for Valentines dinner with my wife. Food came after a good 1 hour of ordering, half of restaurant was booked for some bday party, felt frustated while waiting.But when food came it was worth waiting. We ordered Indo-Chinese as well as north indian.Munchow soup was authentic, Chilli chicken was nicely done spices well balanced and chicken was fresh. Portion size was generous.Good tasty food, worth visit

My wife loves Mayura and we go there quite regularly. The food is a mix of North Indian and some Indian-Chinese dishes (which is meant to be nothing like Chinese cuisine).The food is quite good and the service is decent. The sizzlers are quite nice, as are some of the Schezuan flavoured dishes
4
We went to this place because we had heard a lot and it indeed turned out to be very good. The food was nice, ambience was good and the staff was very friendly. And we went there as a family and everybody was appreciative. I would love to go back and I also recommend this if you want to try good Indian food

The restaurant is well located on the East coast road close to the beach side, and is one of the very popular restaurants on the lane. It is well known for its Indian Chinese cuisine, and the dishes are worth spending on. However, if you aren't a big fan of Indian Chinese, you might be disappointed to visit this place. The very usual north-indian cuisine preparations are below average. We ordered some Afgani chicken starters, followed by butter chicken and Malai Kofta, and didn't really enjoy any of those dishes. The chicken was dry and stiff. The thing that disappointed me the most was service. They were short-staffed, and didn't seem very keen taking the orders. We had to wait for good 15 mins to get our order noted. I would recommend this place, if any only if you are keen on exploring the Indian Chinese. If you are looking for a 3 course north-indian meal, there are better options in the city to explore

My brother has been raving about this place ever since his friend took him there to try the food.Finally found time to try the food there. The order taker was very knowledgeable with the food and even suggested that we try a vegetable dish that would 'surprise' us. :D I asked if this was the cauliflower cos my brother just couldn't stop talking about this dish. This Dry Cauliflower Manchurian really doesn't taste at all like cauliflower and you simply have to try this signature dish of theirs.We loved the naan which was nice and crisp when eaten immediately. The butter chicken masala was also very well flavoured.The dessert of Rasgulla, cotton balls of cheese and semolina cooked in syrup, was a little too sweet for me though the waiter took his time to patiently explain to us the 'correct' way of eating it.He even explained about the fennel which was provided at the end to freshen the mouth and help with the digestion.Service was very good! Get to savour Indian food as well as Indo Chinese food here in Mayura which is along the main road
