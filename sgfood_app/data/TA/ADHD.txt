Other than the swanky chic decor and cool catchy name, the dishes served are disappointing. Restaurant also seems a little unprepared for service probably due to the soft launch of the hotel housing it.

Service was excellent for a Singapore restaurant. Very impressed with the attention to detail. Service was from the heart and not forced. Good food in a beautifully designed establishment. Cant wait to see the rooms in this casual chic hotel.

Excellent rack of lamb and tomato salad I believe it is one of the best lamb dish in singapore , really top quality and supreme taste , great sauce selection for the steak and lamb rack

Breakfast at ADHD was very "good" standard - good selections of food and breads. Set lunches also value for money. Of course if you are willing to spend a bit more, the ala carte menu has more interesting food choices and selections. The decor in the restaurant is beautiful and "atlas". Will return for dinner

The ambience of the place was nice and cosy. Quite a variety of food from the ala carte menu, with asian, malay, indian and western dishes. The food was not bad and the presentation was nice, my friend liked the soto soup she ordered. My fish was also quite nicely done, considering that most restaurants tend to overcook their fish. According to my friend who went a second time, they would change the items on the menu as there was no soto soup then. But during her second visit, the quality of the food seems to have dropped. Service of staff was so so, one of the staff wanted to clear my plate without asking, when I was not even done with my food. I was still holding the cutlery in my hand! Quite appalled at the service standard. Staff should be better trained.Not really impressed, don't think will recommend

I went there with my friends to check out the place as its a new hotel. We didnt have any reservation but they welcomed us and gave us a very nice table. I really love The interior of the restaurant, classy, cozy, & quiet. The food is good, affordable with its quality and quantity. A lot of choices but thanks to the Assistant Manager Mr. ivo who helped us and explained to us the recommended food And we all enjoyed it. The service is remarble, they are all very attentive and friendly. We will probably come back again, as we had a superb dining experience.

Well its a new Restaurant - Well designed and yes it has a pretty large menu. The normal hotel stuff and yes Asian dishes and a good selection of Chinese food as well. We enjoyed our stay and yes there are still some hick-ups between kitchen and service but sure that will be settled one day soon.

We are really amazed at the beautiful interior decor of the South Beach hotel ( designed by Philip Starck) and the interior of ADHD is equally exceptional and amazing. This restaurant has 2 exceptional chefs, one trained in the european culinary cuisine and other is famous for the cantonese and local asian fare. We selected the 3 course Chinese New Year set menu for our casual lunch and the service was very good (though a bit inexperienced - to be expected since this is a fairly new restaurant) The food presentation and the taste was up to our palettes. The timing of the dishes was impeccable. We did not feel rushed or interrupted during our whole lunch which extended into coffee and tea. I would definitely come back to try the dinner experience and look forward to more enjoyable experiences at this cozy and elegant restaurant again and again

Had dinner there; this restaurant is still relatively unknown. While service staff are friendly, some of them still need to be trained. We have a mix of Western and local fare: panini, tenderloin steak, burger and beef rendang. None were remarkable. The food is really average and the ambience is romantic - read dim. For folks with poorer eyesight, the interior of the entire hotel, including this restaurant, needs to have the lighting levels increased for the sake of safety.

First time at ADHD and I am sure I will be back. As per any new establishment, a couple of the service staff seem rather awkward in presenting the menu and identifying out reservation. However, I believe that will be improved overtime with training and experience. For the food, variety is way overwhelming in a good sense. They have the exquisite Western European fare and also local Singaporean dishes for a balance. We had the truffled oxtail and prawn lollipops as starters and immediately we were asking for more. We can smell the truffle before it was even presented on our table. Though it is a fried fish, the oxtail remains tender within the crispy fragrant crust. Must order. The prawn lollipops tasted interested with crispy fried potatoes shreds wrapped around. For potatoes lover like myself, it is heaven.We had the herb crusted veal tenderloin and yes, very local Mee Goreng (a spicy fried noodles garnished with prawns and chicken bits). For the veal, we had medium well but I thought it was a little too much to the well done side. As for the herb crusted portion, the marinate didn't quite blend into the meat and hence not much of the herb taste and flavour. Can be improved certainly with a little more marinate and time for meat to rest. The Mee goreng was excellent , not soggy like some you have experienced from the Hawker centres. Spicy and a good filling main for sure
