Came across this stall when I saw other customers with their Japanese food order during lunch yesterday and it looked good. Decided to get this for dinner takeaway on the same day. Oh my!! It was worth every penny, ordered chicken teriyaki and salmon teriyaki. They were so good that I enjoyed every bit of it. The portion was quite big and the teriyaki sauce was heavenly. Would not hesitate recommending to my friends. Definitely going back there again to try other food. Many choices available to try.The chef and his mum are very friendly. Price wise, it is reasonable as compared to other japanese restaurants, given its portion and yummy taste! GO for it

This stall is run by a young friendly man ( the chef), assisted by his mum. The stall is well designed. Very flashy & bright. The extensive menu & accolades are presented clearly on the front of stall. You can't really miss it as it sets it apart from the row of other dull looking stalls.The chef will recommend his few specialties if you asked him. The menu itself also highlighted these. The menu is pretty wide, with the usual Japanese fares - so really depends on what you like to eat. Have tried a few of the different types eg Katsu, Ebi, Teriyaki chicken, Pepper Salmon ,etc. Must say they are generally very good.Don't come early as they open only at 12.00pm & closes at 8.30pm daily. Except Saturday, when it is closed.If you want good Japanese food without paying high restaurant prices & don't mind eating at a humble place, then you should not miss coming here. I have been here many times. It is highly recommended
