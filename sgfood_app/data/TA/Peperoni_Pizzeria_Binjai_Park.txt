Went there with my family first time. Nice outdoor ambience and we order XXL pizza, vongole, Aglio Olio and Pamas Mozza. Food was good and we all enjoyed our dinner.

THE GOOD: cheaper than eating at those fanciful pizza joints in the city
THE BAD: not all are suitable for local appetite coz it contains certain ingredients that are not liked...

I went there after a long time. Enjoyed the food and beer. It was a Saturday and the staff were quite busy. Had some fish and chip and pasta. Both were awesome. Will go back again.

Pizzas here taste excellent and value for money. Pasta taste good as well. One of my Favourite hangouts around Bukit Timah

Went with a large group of friends for dinner and we all enjoyed the scrumptious pizzas. Love the pizza margherita and the one with rockets and parmesan shards. Highly recommend the chocolate lava cake and the panna cotta. The food is well priced and the service is great! The ambience is casual and cozy and I highly recommend it for family dinners and large groups in specific because you can pre order food and the staff is attentive and super friendly

First time, last time. Thought of to have some fun overall environment, but wasn't exactly the case. The host was very polite & helpful. While server were all also nice & efficient. Just that we couldn't find a niche, nice & tasty pizzas as supposed to be special. Otherwise its just average.

Always loved their pizza. Very generous portion and you get to customize few flavours in one pizza! How good is that! My favourite is always the salmon. But there's once where me and my friends got into serious diarrhea after consuming the pizza from this shop. Not sure which food has gone wrong but it didn't stop us from coming back

My children really love the squid ink pasta and the large pizzas. Beware of the very hot piece of pepper that is in the pasta. I have been there with a gorp of 12 which they accomodated but we had to call ahead to be sure we had seatLocation is in a quite neighborhood off Bukit Timah. We like the ambience.They have a valet service some evenings; in case you are worried about parking. Do call them in advance to chec

I'd normally patronised the Peperoni Pizzeria at Greenwood Avenue, but I'd decided to go to the Binjai Park outlet for dinner on a October Saturday evening. As I'd arrived closed to 9.00pm, there was no problem in getting a table. I'd ordered a bruschetta starter, a linguine pasta aglio olio with prawns and a Leffle Blond beer.The food did not take long to arrive. They were well presented and tasted good. The pasta has a strong chili flavour which I like.Overall the service was good. But the air con didn't seemed to work well even though I was seated indoor, I was perspiring

Used to be great coming here for a weekend dinner but not any more. Their service quality has dropped, no one picks up the ringing phone, lights in the toilet are blown, the kitchen exhaust fan is broken and has been broken for a month. As a result of that, half to two thirds of the pasta dishes are off the menu. The staff have no idea when it would be fixed.I would advise against coming here until they get their act back together
