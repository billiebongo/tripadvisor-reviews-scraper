A simply decorated eatery, I do see the owner/Chef is really passionate about things London. It definitely brought back fond memories for me as seeing the wall decor reminds me of my days in London a few years ago. The menu comprises of Italian (pizza and pasta) and English dishes (bangers and mash, fish and chips). I like that the Chef is able to customise dishes according to your dietary needs. Service is minimal as the cutlery and serviettes are already placed on each table. You also help yourself to drinking water from a side station. There is a large red phone booth outside, just like the ones in London; and it provides you with a photo opportunity

You get a sense of familiarity when you walk into this cafe. Streets of London has a life-size red phone booth, similar to the ones you see in London. It makes a nice addition to your photo. Chef Thomas is extremely hospitable and personally makes it a point to speak to his patrons. He makes recommendations and even said that he is able to customise my order according to my diet. Well done, Chef Thomas. The grilled white snapper fish with special seasoning served with spaghetti and mushrooms in a light creamy sauce was cooked to perfection and was very light. Overall, it was a satisfactory experience and I will not hesitate to recommend this cafe to my friends and family

First off, it's not at Bukit Merah. It's at 451 Joo Chiat Road Katong Point Mall.A non appealing place that you will probably walk past without noticing that they actually have food, or even wonder if they serve any food or drinks because they display none of such from the outside.I was brought there by a friend stating the beef stew is excellent. It is pretty good. Nothing to cry out loud for, but you could taste that it's only been made that very day, period. That is good enough for many that I have tasted locally.The pizzas were excellent in fact. Light and thin crust, non heavy but sumptuous toppings, and reasonable pricing. It was so good I had gulped down 2 pizzas, between the 2 of us.The only thing I'd grumble about is - they could have elaborated on the Bacon toppings, for when they said "Bacon", they meant "Bacon Bits". It's a lot of difference for pizza lovers like me.But overall, I like this place. Non pretentious. No staff or boss coming over to pretend to want to understand your day at work, no ladies coming to get you to drink more, no heavy recommendation on every item on menu being their signature dish. It's the perfect place to unwind a day.I'd certainly return to dine again

Unpretentious place - great food cooked with love by Chef Thomas. My family had cream pasta with sausage, baby back ribs (half slab) and IPA chicken chop today. The pasta was tasty and the sausage was great - homemade and seasoned to perfection. The IPA chicken chop was well marinated and tasted great. The baby back ribs were juicy and tender. The fries were crispy on the outside and soft in the inside. The chicken wings were great starters. Overall a great place to chill and have a good meal at very affordable prices. Definitely a gem in the east of Singapore. Will be back to try the other signature dish - fish and chips
