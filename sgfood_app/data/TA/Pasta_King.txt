This is a restaurant run by an Italian couple who pride themselves on using only the freshest air flown Italian ingredients. The food is good and authentic, and the service is so good. I'll definitely visit it again.

Excellent, authentic Italian cuisine right in the middle of a mature HDB estate!Food is prepared with ingredients from Italy and cooked by an Italian chef, with much pride and love. We had the Cannelloni with Bolognese beef sauce and the Tortelli with black truffle. Homemade pasta for any pasta lover like myself. This is a hidden gem worth discovering.I will definitely be back here.

We found this italian restaurant near our church and decided to visit it last Sunday. Its a small homely simple restaurant located in a ground floor HDB shop units. Run by an italian couple, they offer home cooked style pastas, meats, lasagnes, sausages and desserts. Very home cooked style, like eating with an italian family at home for a meal. It was a full house on sunday and i sensed that the couple and thier kitchen can't cope. So we just ordered various pasta like pesto, vongole to try. It tasted ok. Pasta was al dante, we added a small pinch of salt and some pepper to enhance the flavour. Overall the food was alright. We striked up a convo with the couple and they shared that they started this restaurant about 1 year plus only. So far so good
