We wait for some time after ordering the food. There is a long queue or orders before us but only 1 chef cooking.
Food is delicious n good price. Do hav some patience if you wish to dine here on weekends

Located in the iconic Round Market in Tampines, this is a favourite of easterners. Has been around for more than 20 years and the quality of the dishes is still as good as ever. Gets very busy during weekend dinners with long waiting times. Cheap and unpretentious Zhi Char that will definitely leave you satisfied. Would recommend the Claypot Beancurd, Oyster Eggs, Hot Plate Beancurd, the Claypot Fish Head
