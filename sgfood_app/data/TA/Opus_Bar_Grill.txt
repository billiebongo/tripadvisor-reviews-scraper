Enjoyed the good quality food and quiet surrounding during lunch buffet.The wide salad spread and fresh seafood on ice were well-presented and worth going for a second helping !The Chinese dishes were well-prepared and tasted good.Desserts consisted mainly of cakes and fruits - the cheese cakes were great !On the whole a great lunch at an average price of S$55++

very recommended for those who like dessert and cakes. they also have some other food, like chicken rice, etc. great place for hi te

Second consecutive visit back to the restaurant for the Vday's set dinner. Food was amazing and portion size too. Thank you for the pleasant dinner service

Have booked this restaurant yesterday night to celebrate valentine day one day earlier. The good thing is that from 10 to 13 Feb the valentine day set menu is slightly cheaper than the actual day, moreover there is a 15% discount for using chope for reservation. However since I am allergy to seafood, the bad thing is that the hotel is unable to change the menu for me. Thus we ordered 1 set of valentine day set menu which consist of appetizer, main and dessert plus champagne as well as ala carte main dish. The hotel setting is good and lighting is dim, romantic for couple enjoying the meal. The waiter and waitress are all very friendly, food serving is not very fast though. The food arrived is in big portion, taste is delicious. Dessert is also in big portion and this meal is totally worth the value. Highly recommended to try, definitely will be back to try the other items on the menu

It was a unforgettable dining experience for my date n I.Cozy Beautiful settingImpeccable delights of flavourful set dinner specials.Good choice of meat cuts n juicy lobster, scallops n fish....to die forGreat dining experience :

This time around, I must say that the service standard improved significantly. Food wise quality was good. I was most impressed that they took my earlier feedback seriously

This was our first time trying the Sunday brunch at the Hilton. It's a less crowded and stressful affair than at many other 'big' hotels. The spread is a little less than at alternatives but most importantly everything we tried was excellent. One of my usual complaints at these brunches is that the roast meats are often not up to much, but at this steak-focused restaurant the meats were superb, from the charcuterie to the roasts. One stand out was a scotch egg cooked to perfection.For whatever reason I seemed full far quicker than usual, so didn't get to taste any of the pastas or cooked main dishes, but all looked lovely. Also - and this is quite a sin - the cheese room was overlooked in favour of the deserts. These were simply amazing and the macaroons in particular were to die for. Well, at least that gives us something else to look forward to next time.Only slight blot was that we often had to ask for our glasses to be topped up. I don't think any attempt to be stingy it just seemed the waiting staff were pre-occupied with other tasks

Really good service. The OP steak for 2 is value for money especially when purchased under the steak and wine promotion
4
We paid about $189 for the Bourbon Whiskey Aged Tomahawk Steak (for 2), and it came with free-flow red/white wine since we dined on a weekday night. The beef was really value for money for its taste and quality, although we felt that the whiskey that was poured over the beef was just for show, since it didn't really infuse into the beef. The restaurant was dimly lit, but just enough for a romantic dinner date. However, the seats on the side of the sofa were a little low which made it a little uncomfortable to eat.
5
Enjoyed our porterhouse which was evenly cooked (medium rare) with 2 hr free flow wine. Not only food was great but service was excellent! Will definitely revisit as free flow wine and steak is perfect combi! :

ヒルトン内に入ってるステーキハウスです。宿泊中に利用しました。朝食と同じ会場なので期待していなかったのですが、夜は雰囲気がまったく違いびっくりしました！お店の女性スタッフがとてもフレンドリーで気持ちよかったです。少しの日本語もしゃべってくれました。　料理はどれも最高でした！　8人家族で食事をしましたが、料理の出てくるスピードもっとてもよかったです。　訪れた時間、カップルのみで静かなレストランでしたが、途中から家族連れが多く、お店は結構賑やかになっていました。とても素敵なレストランです。大満足！We visit the restaurant for dinner with 8 persons. One of the woman staff is very friendly and nice service, so we have nice dinner with good mood.The foods are all nice and total cost is ok. I love this restaurant
5
Nice ambience. Awesome and attentive service! Food was amazing too, and it comes with free flow of wine for weekdays! Staff knew that I was celebrating my friend's birthday and presented us with a complimentary slice of cheesecake! Kudos! Thank you
5
We went back to Opus again for the brunch. Overall, the experience was even better with the earlier session. Was very impressed with the range of food available, particularly the tenderloin with foie gras. It was simply cooked to excellence. Will definitely return again
4
Service was definitely good and attentive by the service crew. Was late for almost half hour due to the jam, but they didnt cancel my reservation. thanks.
5
Excellent steak and the service is very attentive. The ambiance is romantically dark. The chatter is average enough to hold a conversation
2
Christmas eve dinner at this grill. Table setting was like in a canteen. This restaurant is supposed to be in a five star hotel yet, the ambiance is not up to standard. Semi-buffet was OK. The main course of steak was of low quality and overcooked for a medium steak. Lobster bisque was diluted, bland and lukewarm. Told staff and nothing happens.
2
We were recommended to try the Signature 800g from the Beef Selection, so we ordered it in Medium Rare. The beef came really Rare, but we decided to try it first. We didn’t ask for a change as we didn’t want to trouble the staff, hence, we tried to eat more of the beef until we really couldn’t chew anymore. About half the beef in, we gave up and decided to takeaway the rest. The staff offerred to cook it more before we took it away so A+ for service! However, we really didn’t enjoy ourselves, hence the poor overall rating.
4
This is my 2nd visit here and I’ve tried both the Rangus Valley Angus & US whisky aged tomahawk and I love them all.Love the idea of free flow wine with my steaks. Great place for dinner. I’ve been recommending this place to my friends and family. I will definitely be back again
5
Celebrated Xmas eve dinner. And the restaurant is exceed my expectation. I did love the place. The food is good taste and I was impressed by cheese room. There’re 30 types of cheese. If you are crazy on cheese, I will like it for sure.
4
Had the signature beef for 2 with free flow wine for 2 hrs. Really enjoyed the wine serving, nice red, white and sparkling wine with generous refilling but Beef is only average. Nice dining ambience and good service
5
Very good service and steak. Free flow white and red wine made it even better. Bday cake on the house. Will be back
5
My partner booked a table for dinner to celebrate my 30th Birthday. We had the tomahawk steak to share which caught my attention after seeing reviews and pictures online. We were not dissapointed - this was super thick and succulent and had a great accompaniment of salts and sauces. Was also a pleasant treat to have the steak flambe'd at our table.Enjoyed the ambiance of the restaurant and was given some excellent service particularly by Bong who looked after us the entire night. We requested to have a quieter area in the corner and he gladly assisted. He was also very knowledgeable about the menu recommendations and also arranged for my birthday cake. Couldn't ask for better service for the occasion. Thank you Bong
4
This is my second visit to Opus Bar and Grill. Food was excellent. However, what marred the night was the poor service from the manager (the one wearing the jacket). The other service staff were better. This particular manager was only interested in serving "1 table", plus he was very rude on my first visit.I would highly recommend you the food, albeit the not so good service.Service can certainly be improved
4
The buffet brunch at Opus Bar and Grill was great! Food selection was not massive but quality of food was great. Especially loved the cheese room. Wonderful selection of cheeses from all over the world
2
Booked this place in advance for anniversary dinner with my boyfriend. Specifically requested for a quiet spot but we were given a table next to a huge group. Upon being seated, we requested for a change of seat. The waitress did not get back to us after 15 mins of waiting, and my boyfriend was literally walking around trying to catch the waitresses' attention to get our seats changed. Read reviews that the restaurant provides a complimentary cake for special occasions, but we didn't get the cake even though I stated it was our anniversary dinner. If you're thinking of a quiet, romantic dinner with your partner for a special occasion, this is not the place for you because the restaurant was anything but quiet. It's more suitable for communal dining. Given the price, I would have expected much better service level. It seems like they are short-handed and we had get off our seat multiple times, walk to the waiters personally to get their attention. I had high hopes when I read about this place, but the overall dining experience was such a disappointment
4
A smart casual dining restaurant offering great steaks in above average price. Nice ambience but some parts of the dining area is too dim to see what you are eating.
2
medium tomahawk steak. the meat was too tough and the fats portion was chewy. the whiskey didnt go well with the meat taste too. quite a disappointment. the restaurant was also too noisy for a nice quiet date
3
Arrived at the front desk and stood there for a full 5 minutes alone as no one was manning it. The place is severely understaffed and it took another 15 minutes to get someone's attention to place my order. Food itself didn't take long to arrive, with the bread served shortly after ordering and the steaks and sides a bit after we were done with the bread. The tenderloin and ribeye steaks were of above average quality and it was a pity we were not hungry enough for the tomahawk, which looked quite impressive from the next table. Getting the bill was, again, a difficult process. Staff were pleasant and apologetic about the waits so this is clearly a management staffing problem and not a direct service issue
5
Brought boyfriend there for his Birthday Celebration and we were attended by wonderful servers. Food was great!! Recommendations was good!! We had the Porterhouse Steak when we told Manager Riduan we want something more tender and he recommended this. Steak was really awesome and the appertizers were all great too!! Thank you Riduan and his team for giving us such a wonderful experience. We will be back soon
4
We ordered the porterhouse steak for 2 Pax with free flow of wines. The steak was nicely done and we enjoyed the food including the sides. However, the place is quite crowded and the tables are too close together. We don't have much privacy and it was abit noisy with all the crowds. Overall, it's a good place if you want to have a legit steak meal
4
We were able to walk-into this pleasant eatery without a booking, which I suspect was a little lucky as it certainly filled up quickly. It had a nice feel about it and the service was attentive. The menu was pretty much what you'd expect from a grill and the wine list had some interesting choices. Overall we were fairly happy although some of my lamb chops were completely rare on the inside, not medium rare. But at least this was acknowledged by taking the cost of one of of our desserts off the bill. After some days of only eating noodles and rice, we were happy enough overall with our experience of a European style eatery
5
came with my partner for his birthday celebration. service was good and a great atmosphere. will definitely come again.

After long day of work, i felt like treating myself for a great steak, having a great experience from my last visit at Opus I decided to give it a go again, but by this time I am alone. I walk in and saw that they are running a full house, knowing that I could be possibly denied cause I didnt book any reservation, I appreciate Riduan's initiative to seat me down despite the fact that he and the others staffs are too occupied... I am please and surprise that he remembers me from my last visit, he even told me that I took what he suggested which is the OP RIB and give me the right pair of wine for it, it feels awesome even if you don't frequently visit you are remembered. After being seated, I ask him to give me sometime to check on the menu so he could attend to other tables as it is really busy so as not to take his time on me. After sometime, still looking confuse on which to eat, this very lovely korean lady approach me and she could tell that I can't decide on what to eat, she is well verse with what Opus is good at. I am convince to order Sirloin steak, a side dish and glass of red, I appreciate her help and anticipation to a confuse guest like me, job well done for her.Food came out fast, I was expecting it will be delayed, but I would completely understand since it's busy, I am very please with my Ribeye, it was fantastic with the bonemarrow sauce on the side. Another worth spending night and excellent Opus experience for me. I will be coming back again and will ask friends to come along with as Opus is honestly the best steakhouse in Singapore.Keep up the superb service and delicious food you guys provide!
4
Nice place to have a good meal without too much fuss. Surprisingly there was a set menu for dinner which wad quite worth it.
5
Great staff who was very attentive and great service overall. Food was good, especially the porterhouse for 2. The free flow wine was the icing on the cake
3
I've read good reviews about the place so I was extremely excited to try it out. We ordered a Tomahawk, truffle fries and a green salad. When the food arrived, everything was perfect. Not to mention the instagram-bility of the presentation, flaming steak and all. The steak was fantastic and the salad was nicely dressed and superbly yummy.However, as the crowd started coming, service standards started dropping too. There are enough staff for the entire floor but they seemed to be all over the place. Said my thank you's and not even a nod or smile. I stopped being nice after awhile.We ordered a second Tomahawk and that one was just lacklustre. My friends were sorely disappointed. Even the way they flambe our steak was just disappointing. Definitely not worth the price tag this time.
4
The food was yummy;The staff was friendly; Delayed cleaning of plates as maybe shorthanded andThey forgot about our request for mini cake slice to celebrate friend's birthday until after 3 reminders. Overall experience still good.
5
Nice open kitchen where you can see the meat being grilledComfortable seating Disappointed at lack of taste / flavor with the Tomahawk despite it looking like a great piece of grilled meatPortions were value for money, overall pleased with quality of food and side dishes
4
This is my first time having dinner at Opus Bar & Grill. I celebrated my husband's birthday. We ordered the Tomahawk, with free flow of sparkling, red & white wine. A complimentary slice of cheese cake was given to my husband. The food & cake were yummy. Will be there again.
5
Server Peggy was excellent. She was attentive, patient, very approachable and accommodative. The rest of the staff were just of mediocre service. It was Peggyâ€™s attitude that was really worth commending as she was outstanding. She set the bar really high. She was the one that made our evening there special
4
We had:- Whisky Aged Tomahawk x2 - Expected this to be much more smoky- Porterhouse x1- Angus x2 - Excellent cut
4
Service was really good despite the crowds and multiple requests! And this friendly attitude not only coming from one staff but all of them. A very good teamwork indeed which makes my dinner a great one! Food on the other hand is disappointing. The steak was tough and tasteless.The truffle mushroom sauce tasted like soya sauce :( Maybe should give other steak a tr
4
Great ambience and food. Nice welcome cocktail as well. Except maybe for the tedious reservation process. This is the only buffet that asks to fill in form with credit details. And need to send the form back, and will be charged for cancellation within 2 days and no refund for no show. Really would be quite perfect if not for the reservation.
5
Came here on a whim and it was worth it. They have some sort of deal right now when you buy meats, you get unlimited wine. My partner and I took full advantage of the deal. Meat was great, sides were yummy and the service was on point. Green peppercorn sauce is where it's at. Would definitely come again
5
My family and I had a wonderful time at the restaurant. The food was amazing and the service exceptional. A special shout out to Riduan and Bae for being such great hosts
5
Food and cocktail are good. We bought our toddler along. Is a child friendly restaurant. Staff are attentive as well.
4
Great steaks + wines selection in a comfortable dining room. The wine promotions are a bonus. We shall return
5
My third visits, service and ambience were great as usual.. enjoy the steak and free flow of wine. A bit disappointed as the steak is abit cooked despite I order medium
5
Excellent service provided by Riduan who himself give us a great recommendation for Steak(OP-rib) and wine that goes along with it. Side dishes are also fantastic, well season portobello mushroom, creamy mac and cheese and truffle fries. Staffs were very attentive as well especially Fauzi who is very engaging to the guest and checking out how was everything on that evening. Great job for the chefs as well as it turn out a worst train breakdown to an unforgetable dinner
1
1. Food served real slow2. Customers who came later than us were already half way finishing their meals 3. Steaks got wrongly cooked also 4. Paid for 3 course meal but only served 2, missing a dessert5. Manager should refund / void the bill, instead they proposed to give us a voucher for next visit – this is totally unacceptable 6. Still water was not billed at first, server came back with another bill to pay for the bottle of $17.66 water again 7. Poor management with insufficient and insufficient staffs especially the poor fellow stationed to grill the steaks all by himself on a Friday dinner ( restaurant was 80 % full) thus the slow serving 8. Not impressed by the food either, nothing is worth to re-visit 
4
Although the Buffet area doesn’t look so wide as others, there were quite a wide spread of food. We didn’t try everything as we were very selective. Wouldn’t want to waste our stomach capacity. Our favourites were the foie gras, oysters, fresh prawns and the cheese room. For the price we paid, it was quite reasonable. The pay 2, dine 3 offer is the best deal. Wine served was good as well. Worth to give it a tr
4
Spread ain’t big but we loved the well roasted beef strip loin and the very huge fresh tiger prawns. Sashimi ought to be sliced thicker and sushi presentation need to be improved. I thought the tom yam sauce was lacking in the squid ink pasta with tiger prawn. The sauce should be more and thicker consistency.
4
Wide selection, pride in preparation, good service, nice flavours and reasonable pricing makes Opus a great option for a steak night out. The free flow wines promo during weekdays was a big bonus
3
Had lunch there because they had a "chope" promotion which made it good value for 2 .First of all the good points. The waiting staff were good. They were attentive, friendly and pretty much did their job well. Like the ambience too.The presentation of the food too was good. There was a reasonably decent spread of $48. The sashimi/sushi, roast duck, chicken dishes,prawn salad, cheese spread were pretty decent.The beef and fish in the cook section were somewhat over cooked and became a bit dry and tough. Maybe it's been in the warmer makes it so.The lamb roast looked good but ended up a bit dry and tough which was a pity. It had all the necessary condiments but the main dish could have been much better. The pasta section could be improved too. Although it was cooked on the spot , the final product still leaves room for improvement.There was Indian food but it was mainly vegetarian so I passed , I would suggest dropping the Indian section so the staff can concentrate on improving the rest of the spread. More is not always better :-)A small nitpicking point about the dessert. After a while the cheese cake looked a bit messed up. The staff should "tidy" it up so it wouldn't look so messy.Free flow of hot beverages is always welcome, thank you for that,Overall I like the restaurant for the ambience and good service. The head chef was also very friendly and positive. I get the feeling that he was genuinely interested in feedback so that he could improve the spread. So I hope he takes this constructively. The restaurant has the potential to be much better 
4
As a whole, Opus steakhouse is a great place to go if you want excellent steak at reasonable prices. I was especially fond of the Rangers' Valley Angus Rib and the Grainge Angus Tenderloin. I can recommend the tuna tartare, the scallops and the foie gras from the starters, and the grilled pineapple and the Bombe Alaska from the desserts were amazing. Avoid the smoked risotto though.
5
Very much enjoyed the daily buffet breakfast in Opus, good variety, great egg options, fabulous pastries tho a little imagination lacking with the fresh items/fruits

Read the good reviews here last month and made a reservation for 2 pax way in advance with a mention of a birthday celebration. Arrived and despite the restaurant being almost-empty, we were shown to a table in the middle of the restaurant, right beside a couple who probably wanted some privacy too. We asked to change tables and good thing our request was granted. Food wise, the cheese selection was very average, while my partner's lamb dish was somewhat tough. Unfortunately, I had to send back my rib-eye steak not once but twice, as they simply could not do medium rare. When I alerted the waiter that my second steak was still well done, he asked in a slightly frustrated tone if I wanted rare instead. We felt this jibe was unnecessary. We left almost immediately after we had finished the food as the mood was somewhat tarnished.The only saving grace: Good service at some point from one particular waitress. We don't think there was any value for the money we paid hence we will not be back. Could've had a better birthday dinner somewhere else
5
Good value for their steak with free flow wine! The side dishes were glorious as well, and the dessert was great-- chocolate lava flowed smoothly and it was so pretty i almost didnt wanna eat it
3
This is our 2nd trip and definitely didn't leave up to our 1st experience. The porterhouse was not done medium as we requested.I doubt we will go back again
2
Very disappointing.Price wise extremely expensive mainly if ones takes onto consideration the ridiculous size of the portions . No real value for your money.
4
We were here for a celebratory Sunday Brunch, and Opus proved to be the perfect choice. The food selection, while not as diverse as other hotel restaurants in Singapore, makes up for what it lacks in variety with quality.Highlight of our meal was the foie gras served on a fillet of wagyu beef - this was decadence on another level. Opus is also one of the few places in Singapore to serve Scotch Eggs, and they do it so very well, with the eggs turning out perfectly crisp on the outside while remaining on the right side of well done on the inside.A good selection of cheeses and access to their well-stocked dessert counter rounds off a very satisfying brunch experience
5
Quality ingredients throughout simplicity with lots of creativity.Purity of grilling with sustainable seafood and unique cocktails.
3
steak was not cooked well. We ordered medium, but came up with rare. It may be good for other things, but not at cooking steak
5
I booked this place for a birthday celebration with my husband. I am glad that I chose this place as the staff is attentive and great service. We had 2 course dinner and we were happy with our food selection. The steak is great and the appetizer foie gras and tartar is yums
5
The atmosphere is awesome with great service. I dont eat beef but my friends said that the beef is super delicious and they finished all of them up within mins. As for me, I ordered fish. I thought the fish wouldnt be that great because their main menu are mainly beef, but I was super wrong. It was exceptionally good! I will highly recommend this to people who love beef
5
Nice ambient and the service is good. The set dinner is value for money. The grill steak coming with free flow of wine
4
We dined on the free-flow wine deal on steak midweek. We tried a tenderloin which was indeed tender and flavoursome. The other dishes were equally as good. Very generous with the wine pouring and as you'd expect from the venue it's quite decent. A very enjoyable evening
5
I was visiting Singapore and catching up with friends. We had dinner at Opus at the Singapore Hilton because a) it was near where I was staying and b) because we'd heard about their fabulous grill. We certainly were not disappointed. Three of us ordered the 250gm Grainge Angus, 150 day grain fed rib eye and one friend ordered the U.S. Greater Omaha 220gm prime grade 100 day corn fed sirloin. We ordered a lovely selection of sides and sauces. Steaks were cooked to perfection. And best of all we got the most out of the promo deal of "free pour" wines with any steak ordered! Definitely worth a return visit
5
One of the few restaurants in Singapore that has delivers in terms of its food, service and overall dining experience. The oysters were fresh and succulent, and the ranger valley t-bone mb4 delicious. Have it with the accompanying salts to bring out its full flavour. Service is warm and exceptional as staff really go out of their way to make the experience an enjoyable one which keeps me coming back. Despite a minor slip-up during one visit where my booking was wrongly keyed in, I was won over by the sincerity of the staff who immediately rectified the error and won me over with their cheerfulness, attention to detail and effort to make my dining experience a pleasant one. Kudos to the team!
5
Tried the cold pasta with Hokkaido Scallops and Uni and it was amazing. The set meals are affordable and value for money.
5
It was our first time at Opus for Sunday Btunch. The food and service were impeccable. We will definitely be back!
5
Great food, comfortable elegant ambience, attentive service and surprising value for money prices - What else could we ask for?Loved the tandoori chicken skewer, smoked mozzarella salad and Hokkaido scallops for starters.The Opus Grill burger was among the best I've had. Their special dry aged beef was very good. We loved the sides too - Mac & Cheese, portobello mushrooms, green asparagus.Must end the meal with Grilled pineapple cake
4
Tried the porterhouse steak that comes with 2 free sides. Steak was awesome. Had red wine as well as there is a 50% promotion off. Nice recommendation for those who likes steak
5
I've been to Opus about 5 times now and they are consistently excellent. The quality of their steaks are cooked to perfection, medium rare is indeed medium rare. Their service staff - top notch, friendly, warm, attentive and diligent. It's the place to get your steak "fix
5
We were staying at shangri la and wondered down to the Hilton. Opus grill is a very nice restaurant with beautiful cuts of meat.
4
The Porterhouse Steak was grilled to a perfect medium rare. What made the meal even more enjoyable was the promotion of 2 hrs free flow wine & 2 free side dishes of your choice. Nice to see the action in the Kitchen. Staff were all very friendly and cheerful and service was very good. Nice ambience but found it too dim esp the tables further away from the kitchen.Hope Hilton will keep having great promotions like this.
5
They have an excellent promotion, $128 for 1-1.2kg porterhouse with free flow wine. The steak was delicious and mind you, the wine with the promotion was decent. What was exceptional was the service. They were all very attentive and patient in explaining the menu.
4
I visited this restaurant three times. Once I ordered the rib eye. I never had such a thin steak. Looked mangled too. At the same sitting I had the mushroom soup. That was so good almost made up for the disappointing steak. On the next visit we ordered the porterhouse steak for 2. That was real steak. Big, nicely cooked, cut up so you don't have to fight with your dining companion. They had a special with it: two sides and unlimited wine. On another occasion I had the wild seabass. Comes on a bad of shellfish and fish stew. They were all very delicious

Brought my Wife to celebrated her birthday tonight. After reading up on all the reviews on TripAdvisor (TA) I knew I couldn't be wrong. After calling a couple of times a few days back I was told that it was fully booked and I would not be able to make any reservations. But after looking on TA I decided to email and enquire about reservations. To my delight, Richard replied and advised me that I could select the second seating at 830pm, which I gladly confirmed. When we arrived, we were shown to a private corner at the restaurant. I was delighted. Right off the bat I will tell you that the service from the start to the end of the night was perfect. Their attention, their friendliness and their knowledge of the menu is next to none. We knew exactly what to order after speaking to Peggy (two thumbs up to her). For starters I ordered the oysters and my wife ordered the tuna tartar. (Hands down, arguably the best oysters I've ever had). And I've had many before. For mains we went with the Angus Ops rib eyes for two. It was cooked to perfection and was plenty for the two of us, coupled with the asparagus and broccoli sides. #foodcoma I was already informed by Richard (at the first email) that we would get a Complimentary slice of cake for my wife's birthday. True to their word they discreetly came by with the surprise of my wife. She was happy. And as you know, happy Wife happy life. :) Overall, we had a tremendously enjoyable night and I would 100% recommend everyone to make that visit to Opus. Amazing service, amazing staff and great food. I know I will be back.

2nd visit-and they had a new porter house steak promo for Father's DayMixed reviews - porterhouse steak wasn't great but no fault of restaurant as my personal preference was ribeyeChoice of free flow wine was merlot for red which I felt didn't bring out the flavourful steak. 2nd time I felt this way since the last time we had the ribeye steak. A more full bodied red is prob better.They ran out of sparkling wine and our oysters took a while to be served.Will I be back? If they change the red wine , it will be a big yes.if not, mehhhhh
3
Went for the 800g $120 angus steak which was excellent, smokey flavour and cooked on the bone.3 course set dinners are value for money, main with either steak or one type of fish.Only let down was poor service of staff, had to call for a waitress a few times before our order was taken, food took about 1hr+ to be served, and they forgot one of the sides.
5
Steak was good. Lamb rack is so so. Wine has 50% off which is a good deal. If not, really expensive plac

Went for a celebration.. expected better staff service for the hotel standard of the Hilton name..was left disappointed. We arrived 10mins early and waited for a while before a staff appeared to inform us blandly that we were too early. Good that the buffet spread was ready.. wide range of live stations and cooked food but we were sadly not able to attempt all. Seafood was not very fresh for the price of the buffet but alright, not terrible too.. there were notably some flies with a stronger than usual smell given off by the seafood. Service by one of the waiter serving wine was not very welcoming as we were given a rather glaring stare and not duly informed of what we could have (we booked the free flow sparkling and wines brunch).. There appeared to be a different treatment based on the guest type. I had to check online to confirm our entitlement. (Sparkling, red, white and beer). We did not end up drinking a lot either due to a limited stomach space. Red wine, however is of good quality. No sub standards wine were served for buffet. Another waiter appeared to be injured as he had some kind of arm-guard on (the kind one with a sprain wears), and he ended up spilling some wine when pouring it. I was wondering what he was doing working if not well. The saving grace of service possibly came from the waiters at the Grilled Meats section who knew their stuff and were friendly & professional enough. Meats were well cooked and delicious. Foie gras melts in the mouth. It was rather disappointing to note a strand of hair in one of my foods, although unknown if it belongs to a guest or a staff.At the cheese section, while there was a wide variety of cheeses, along with the acclaimed Raclette, most of the cheeses were not yet cut or sliced for guests to pick from. Perhaps it was too early, or its not expected of the staff to assist guests. We had to cut the cheese ourselves from a large block which made us hesistant as we not want to destroy the large block, not to mention it was rather tough to use the cheese cutter. The solo staff was standing there watching us. Another guest had to kindly offer his service. Desserts is a wide spread of sugar. They do better with the pretty desserts in a bottle, and the cakes selection. Loved the fruits selection for fondue, but not the chocolate. candies variety pleasantly brought me back to my childhood days. Overall rather over priced brunch in my opinion with the service standards not up to par.
5
Excellent Service! We had booked a promo on Prime steak+ free flow wine on Fri evening but was told there was an error. However they were glad to honour it as I explained it was my birthday dinner. The steak was well executed and we enjoyed it thoroughly. They were rather quick to dispense the wine.The Filipino manager even asked if I would like a pc of cake, hearing we were there for my birthday. Excellent service although I declined it. The whole service team was great!Well done, team

reasonable price for prime cut dry-aged of meat, service staff was excellent, atmosphere was cosy, location was great, and will definitely recommend my friend.

I had a group of 10 dining at Opus last night. The chef is kind enough to create special dish for my vegetarian friend (photo). The lamb rack is heavenly, I would definitely go there for that again! Only 1 minus point I was charged according to the 1st order list submitted when I have already made changes to my order 1 week ago. They charged me for a side dish that I didn't get to eat. Extra plus point when they allow everyone to settle the bill individually. Save the accounting headache as we normally encounter.Overall it was a lovely experience. Special shoutout to Dewi for being attentive to our table and Sarah for taking care of us from email arrangement until dinner time.

I had a great experience for dinner here. The restaurant remembered my Chope request for a quiet dinner, and the server was prompt in highlighting the various promotions, including the Citibank 20% discount. Food variety was limited, but quality was reasonably good. the chicken skewers came in big portions, so were the sides! The main courses of wagyu burger and Australian wagyu steak were also ok. The server also remembered it was my wedding anniversary and provided the (complimentary) famous Hilton cheesecake for dessert. A great way to end the night

We were introduced to Opus during a couples gathering last week. I have to admit I am not much of a red meat consumer but I was pleasantly surprised by my visit to Opus. Hidden behind the lobby lounge in an artfully designed decor, Opus offered a rustic ambience of a modern day steakhouse with open kitchen and displays of a selection of aged meats. I decided to go with a dinner selection menu which started with tuna tartar followed by a tenderloin medium rare. The steak was prepped to perfection and sized just right for my liking....tender and juicy. My partner ordered the seabass which will be my choice to sample in a future visit. We enjoyed the privacy of the seating arrangements which allowed for private conversations away from the main flow into the restaurant. There were tables available for a Friday evening so if you are looking for a good steak experience, Opus is a good option in Orchard especially after a long week of work and travels.

We absolutely loved OPUS. A great offer of free flow with you steak main course. The quality of the meat if spot on and the service very attentive. We truly had a lovely time. Highly recommend it
3
I ordered the signature 800 grams Rangers Valley Angus OP Rib Dry-Aged (Marbling Score 4) and a Tartare of Bluefin Tuna, both for sharing. Perhaps due to the sheer thickness of the cut of meat, the ribs had uneven cooking (I asked for medium doneness), some parts were dry and somewhat became tougher to chew. We couldn't finish it in the end. The accompanying sauces were good, and the tuna was ok as well
5
The steak was excellent and the portion was good for 2 people. The service was good as well, they were very friendly and polite.
4
Went there for the $100Gourmet event organised in conjunction with CitiBank. It was extremely good value for money as we had a 6 course dinner for just $100. Service was prompt (but not that impressive) and the food was good. I especially enjoyed the cod, oyster and foie gras. Would definitely be interested in returning to try out the usual menu. Hopefully the regular dishes are just as good as the one-off dishes
5
Wide spread of fresh live seafood, signature charcoal grill prime cuts and not forgetting the yummy foie gras jn 3 different styles. Definitely worth the price!
5
Great food selection including Alaskan King Crab, Oysters, lobsters, prawns, sushi, sushimi, a good variety of cooked dishes, Carvery including beef, lamb, chicken and pork. Amazing cheese room and dessert selection, Too much food to mention. We took the wine package, which was good value as it included a Sparkling, White and Red French wine. Special mention goes our waiter to Dave Tang who provided great customer service

This is one very versatile location.This is the 'coffee shop' of the Hotel so is also where breakfast is served.Lunch typically has a buffet as well as a la carte.Dinner is a la carte and is a high end grill.I did not realise it was a high end grill so was a bit surprised when we ate dinner there to be confronted with fine dining rather than just a coffee shop.Food was good, service was good, the price was a bit of a shocker though

Opus in the Hilton is a lovely place to dine, and not merely because the uneven and unfriendly service has greatly improved, when compared to late-2016 in a previous visit for steak and oysters and asparagus. Unfortunately, the good food was let down by several mistakes in other areas.Other than walking out without smelling like the food being cooked in various ways regardless of where you are seated, the setting is romantic and pleasantly quiet in the evening, although the atmosphere may be slightly affected if a large party of more than 10 people is present at a table. Friday evening is popular so if you prefer less people around, choose a different weekday evening. The round onion cheese loaf which was sliced into 4 quarters and served can be purchased from the D9 Cakery, outside the restaurant and bar. Sadly, the bread appeared to have been warmed and then left sitting for too long, before being served. It is delicious when served warm, and the butter enhances it. Sadly, this was not the case today. Is it too difficult to expect warm bread being properly served in a restaurant which seemingly prides itself on high standards and decor, without needing to tell the wait staff? There is a need to ensure wines are stored properly after opening and before opening, so as not to affect the initial positive impression of the restaurant, when patrons order wines by the glass. The 2013 riesling from Leeuwin Estate 'Art Series" of the Margaret river would have been a welcome match for the main course of fish, except the temperature was too warm when served and the contents appear to have oxidised, upon one sip and tasting the dourness of what was poured out. Château Mont-Redon is renowned for Châteauneuf-du-Pape, but I could not remember if the Southern blend of viognier and roussanne from 2015 would be decent. It is still too young to drink, on top of its flaws which include too much mineral, and no amount of airing in a decanter will improve its current tasting notes leaning too far to the herbal, although the grapefruit is discernible. The ingredients used for the tartar of bluefin tuna is top-notch and incredibly fresh. The cheese wafer atop it was cold (resembling a manner of having been left out in the open for too long), not crispy and did not compliment the tartar, so it was left unfinished after 2 bites. Unfortunately, the tartar as a whole was underwhelming. Good ingredients can only take a dish so far, and there needs to be more thought put into this dish to heighten the flavours and contrast of the avocado and tuna beyond the use of olive oil. This restaurant has received an MSC certificate for using sustainable seafood prior to opening, but I am surprised that the Marine Stewardship Council would issue a certificate including bluefin tuna as sustainable, given all the news reports about bluefin tuna available when quickly using Google to check. The wild sea bass sitting atop ingredients such as clams, black mussels and vine-ripened tomatoes in a large bowl containing a sweet.light and savoury broth was wonderful. Crisp on top, juicy and firm in every bite, this was superior to the medium-rare Kobe cuisine Australian wagyu I once ordered for dinner in 2016. The skillfully-executed broth and superb preparation of the fish reminded me of enjoying Australia's top-notch fine-dining seafood restaurants. It would have been better if a plate was also provided, so the fish could be eaten more easily than attempting a balancing act. However, a lone crustacean feeler was fished out and a bit later, as the broth was significantly reduced after happy consumption, a fish bone at least 14 millimetres in length was also fished out. Not a surprise I enjoyed. The 2015 Borgo Maragliano "La Caliera" Moscato d'Asti DOCG is a good choice in the wine list as a dessert wine, and went well with the dessert of coconut-calamansi ice-cream, charcoal-grilled bananas and dollops of smoked salted caramel. The amount of caramel was just right. A delightful ending. For a set dinner or a la carte menu, Opus provides excellent value for money and quality and choices. The negatives are jarring, but not enough to deter one from returning, unless the litany of mistakes continue. I hope the restaurant will continue its improvements, because it has the potential to be a well-loved institution in Singapore, such as when one thinks of Gordon Grill in Goodwood Park Hotel

I'd been once before and the experience was generally very good, and most of our evening on this occasion was too. I get the impression that it never gets too busy, and subsequently the atmosphere is on the quiet side. But the setting is nice and comfortable.One goes primarily for the steak, though the deal on drinks is also extremely good (we had the 50% off any bottle of wine valid all evening Fri + Sat). We were a table of six and had three of the large sharing steaks with a host of sides. Two steaks were the high quality one expects but the other was surprisingly poor. Not inedible but hardly worth eating. The restaurant didn't charge us for that one when we demanded that, and the service was good throughout.Overall a very nice evening and I will go again
3
Opus was a great find - clean, comfortable, cool and very convenient for Hilton guests. The cakes were mouth-watering
4
This was the first time we had been to this restaurant in the Hilton. We had read reviews and went there for my wife's birthday. Unfortunately their "system" was down so our reservation was lost. Nevertheless we got our table straight away. The place was quite busy for a Monday night which seemed a good sign. We opted for the set dinner menu. Starters were ok but not out of this world. Steaks arrived but not the sides. We started to eat the steaks but when the sides still did not arrive we stopped. Waitress arrived and went to search for our sides, which arrived a few minutes later. This was disappointing, especially was the sides of creamy mash potatoes, broccoli and truffle fries combined with the steaks wonderfully. Steaks were good with good flavour. The sides were very hot and fresh, which always helps. Deserts were good and a slice of cheesecake with a candle for my wife's birthday was duly delivered. The waitress told us they would not charge us for the sides. Who doesn't like it when a restaurant recognises a mistake and does something to make you feel better? Good coffee to finish off what was in the end a very enjoyable meal. Hope to come back to sample some of the other steaks. Good job
3
Stopping by because my friend wants to eat the cheesecake here. We ordered blueberry cheesecake, cappuccino, crunchy callipso, berrylicious. All is tasty!
5
We had the aged steak and it was very good. We went to the restaurant when Opus bar was celebrating its 2nd anniversary, so there was a very good on-going promotion where we had free flow wine for 2h. Even without the promotion, I think the food was superb and service attentive.
4
Tried the Sunday Brunch. Great value with promo. Delicious foie gras and meat carvings. King crab legs are fresh and sweet initially, but the quality dropped in subsequent refills. Tried the unique dragon's breath too. Enjoyed the brunch
3
We only visited for dinner and were quite impressed with the place.The set up, food and ambience were amazing. Unfortunately the service wasn't so great - the waitress who although was absolutely lovely, struggled to open the bottle of wine we had ordered. No fuss but it did take a while and my partner in fact offered to help her open it just before she was able to sort it out.Around 10/10.30pm she also informed us that the kitchen was closed and that we couldn't order dessert. Which was not a big issue. But then she mentioned she had informed the person who made the reservation (which was the concierge at the Marriott hotel we were staying at that night) it seemed almost as if she was trying to make sure she wouldn't get in trouble and that we "had been informed." Which was a bit strange. Somewhat made us wonder about whether she worked in fear of losing her job. Lol.Nevertheless it was a lovely dinner and we will be back, but we may try a different restaurant
4
Attentive service, everyone was nice and welcoming. Relaxed, clubby atmosphere, a bit quiet in the early evening. Steak was excellent, well cooked and plentiful, alas no room left for desert
5
We were celebrating our daughter's result for A-levels. Decided to try out this place. Excellent service and food. Their specially is beef. Don't miss their dry-aged Angus. Although it was good for 2, it will serve 4! Their starters are tantalizing and appetite wetting. Fantastic service by their staff. Highly recommended.
5
Opus Grill at the Hilton Hotel has managed where many hotel restaurants fail. Great, cosy, romantic atmosphere with the open grill operation in full view of guests. And, most important of all - they kept the prices to normal levels. Wonderful menu and not just for meat eaters - all priced to present great value. The food was excellent and artistically presented. The service by our attendant named MEGA was very attentive and professional. We can highly recommend this restaurant. A must go when in Singapore
4
Fabulous meal! Shared a 1kg T-Bone...beautifully done, plenty for 2. Tuna tartare and prawn skewer for starters. And amazingly free flow wine for 2 hours. Excellent service too. Definitely going back!
5
My partner and I enjoyed the ambience, food and service quality offered at Ops Bar & Grill, great place for a date
5
My parents enjoyed the food a lot. And also they love the ambience that the place had to provide. It was extremely romantic during the Valentine's Day period and they had an amazing 4 course set dinner prepared for them :

$85++ per pax with 15% off via chope booking. Food was not as good as I expected but passable. Staff were friendly and provided good servic

Love the the aged beef steak being done according to our liking. The service was excellent! Our wine glass was never empty and the staff was very attentive. Will definitely come back again
4
The waitress was very friendly and we had a really good time on Valentine's Day! Nice ambience and decent food
5
Ordered the valentine's day menu and was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food. The scallops with bernaise sauce was the highlight of the meal!
5
The service and food was good excellent. And the price of their vday menu is quite reasonable comepare to other fine dining places
5
Restaurant was pleasant in reserving a window seat as per request. Smooth arrival process. Food was great and table server was good. One improvement that would be good is for the food runner to have more excitement and smiles when introducing the dishes instead of reciting the dishes' ingredients as a jo

Getting a good steak is Singapore is fairly easy, the biggest challenge is deciding which restaurant to go to. We have our favourites but decided to try Opus, it was surprisingly empty, the service was not bad until towards the end when an icecream for our somewhat tired and grumpy Daughter took 20 mins.The steak was fine, not the best but not the worse either.The highlight was another table celebrating a birthday with a cake, decided to share the cake with all the other diners, bless them.So it's one of those OK reviews, wouldn't rush there again but wouldn't avoid it either
5
Seafood was highlight, though I find the dessert offerings limited. Overall the spread was sufficient and luxurious. Would go again if there is a promotion.
4
Great place for grilled food. Yummy and affordable sides. Set meal is not bad value at all and as is expected of a Hilton property service is quite excellent.
5
Went to Opus specially for their Signature 800g OP Rib steak. Ordered it medium-rare and it was perfectly done. Beautiful marbling in the meat, very tender and fatty. The cost of $120 for this to share among 2 people was value-for-money compared to ordering separate steak dishes. We had Bearnaise sauce and mushroom sauce. I don't recommend Bearnaise sauce with this steak as the steak itself is too fatty and the taste of the sauce is overpowered. The mushroom sauce goes very well with it. I would also think the red wine sauce may go well with the steak.The only complaint was this: we were seated where we had a straight view into the kitchen where they slice the steak before serving it. It seems that the chef slicing the steak left a sliver of meat from the middle of the steak on the chopping board and apparently helped himself to it when his back was to the restaurant. We were disappointed that such an incident would happen but the steak was really so good that I still give this restaurant a full 5 stars. We will return for the steak but hopefully not notice similar unprofessionalism.

We visited on a Friday night for dinner. The staff informed us that we could order a bottle of wine at half price with any steak order. They also told us about their festive set menu. We ended up ordering one festive set menu, which had a main of 180grams of Australian Omaha ribeye, and an ala cartel order of 220grams of Kobe wagyu. We then ordered a bottle of 2009 Barolo at $80 after the discount - a very good deal!Both steaks were excellent in different ways. The Wagyu was melt-in-the-mouth, but the Omaha was very flavoursome. We shared an appetizer of tuna tartare with avocado, and a dessert of grilled banana with ice cream. Both the appetizer and dessert were good though not outstanding.Overall we enjoyed the visit to Opus. The food is of a good quality at a decent price
5
It serve a variety of cold dish, sushi. Dining place is modern and there are a lot of friendly staff
3
We had a t-bone to share, which was a little bit disappointing. Very expensive, but nothing special. The atmosphere of the place is quite nice, cosy and classy at the same time. Service could be more attentive. Order of couses was not observed and two courses were served at the same time, which was quite annoying. A soup was not hot enough
4
Good ambience, good service just that till the end took quite a while for our bill.Slightly overprice, food taste average
2
Came here for a quick lunch with friends and we all ordered the Opus burger with two choices of accompaniment. We all had bacon and cheddar cheese as our first choice of cheese was not available. When the burgers arrived we were busy scraping off the "cheddar" from our burger patties as the yellow plastic sheet didn't look edible. Expected the Hilton to at least serve real cheddar cheese and not the sheet plastics one sees in fast food cafes. We had to ask for tomatoe catchup and remind the staff to give a teaspoon as it came in a little saucer. The onion sambal advertised on the menu was found on the side of the bottom bun under the pattis with two minuscule slivers of gherkins, the tiniest I have ever seen. Definitely a burger made without love.
5
I have been to many places but missed this one for one reason or another because it is very low profile. Was there with the family for brunch recently and what a find. The seafood including oysters from different places and Alaskan crab legs were not only succulent ad sweet but we're constantly being replenish because of the heavy demand. The roast were as good as any you can get at a good steak house and the foie gras with tenderloin was to die for. One cannot get to everything that they throw in but even the sweets were great. Their cheese cake is still the best in town and I told the pastry chef she did a wonderful job to live up to the Hilton's reputation. If you do drink, go for the free flow wine inclusive as it is worth the money. I certainly will be back at this joint more often now that I discovered this hidden treasure
5
Dinner at Opus was a delightful experience. The ambience was quiet yet warm and cozy. The food was delightful. The oysters were fresh and succulent, the wagyu ribeye flavoursome especially with the special salts on the side. Rounded it all off with a coconut tart from the cafÃ©. It was a satisfying meal and the service was first class. Kudos to the wonderful staff who were helpful, attentive and sincere.
5
Had the $92 wagyu steak which was very good but frankly, failed to blow my mind. Next time would probably go for something simpler. With that aside, my missus' tuna tar tar was delicious, garlic fries were just sublime and my foie gras almost made me dirty my pants. In all respects, a great place to spend your evening at. +++

We kindly responded to staff who understood Japanese. Thank you (^^).It is very calm atmosphere grill

excellent dinning experience with friends Very good Steaks deal with free flow of good french wines Try the dessert .....famous cheese cakeService was at the topThanksWe will definitely come bac

Came to the Opus restaurant for my birthday dinner. Ordered the Tenderloin steak, fries, green salad and asked for mustard with it.The first course was the Tuna tartare. This was quite good.After the first course, it took an inordinate amount of time for the steak to arrive. When it finally turned up, it was cold. Seriously. The sauce (served in a separate dish) was warmer than the steak. Very odd. I got the impression that the steak sat somewhere, cooling off, waiting to be served.I had ordered a side of fries, which only came after I asked for it, halfway after finishing the steak. The mustard only came with the fries. Disappointing.Not too sure I will return to the restaurant
5
Opus bar and Grill interior has a simple yet elegant ambience. The seatingâ€™s are spaciously apart where you can enjoy your intimate and cozy dining with your love ones. They have a show kitchen for diners to enjoy the culinary team preparing and grilling the food.We tried their signature 800g Rangers Valley Angus OP rib dry aged with a marble score of 4. The steak is rich and flavorful; beautifully charred with a pinkish medium raw within. A good value steak for a start. Loved their grilled portobello mushrooms. Servers are attentive as well. The only thing that should be improved is to serve their complimentary onion loaf warm.Over all experience with Opus is excellent and will definitely go back to try their prime steak
5
Was taken by surprise that a hotel's all - day dining outlet can whip up such a fine meal ! Dined at ' Opus ' during this edition of Restaurant Week & the dinner was excellent . Generous portion size f succulent scallops started the dinner set , followed by Angus ribeye with a superb truffle Mushroom sauce . And dessert -- it leaves one speechless !

The restaurant was one of the many restaurants which offered restaurant week menu during the one week long Singapore Restaurant Week. As I was early for my reservation for lunch which cost $40++ for a 3-course set meal, I was asked to take a seat at the bar area before showing to my table in the restaurant. Interestingly the restaurant was also offering buffet during lunch time. There was a huge noisy group sitting behind me who were having the buffet option.I was served onion cheese loaf with butter on a wooden chopping board. I would preferred the bread to be served hot. The bread was soft, filled with bits of soft, brown onion bits.Tartar of Bluefin Tuna (ala carte $17++)avocado, chives, trout roe, extra virgin olive oilThe raw fish was well marinated and flavourful, with the sea salt enhancing the taste.Wild Sea Bass (ala carte $36++)clams, black mussels, artichokes, vine tomatoes and thymeThe serving was much bigger than expected. The fish was chunky and firm. The stock which served was light and flavourful.Grilled Honey Pineapple (ala carte $12++)vanilla ice-cream, crumbles and rum sauceThe dehydrated pineapple was crunchy and full of the fruit flavours. The rum sauce was rich but was easily overpowered by the vanilla ice cream. The crumbles added texture to the simple looking dessert.Overall food was great. Service was great too with water refilled regularly and the service staffs checking on me regularly. One even asked if I needed some magazines. Bill was presented on top of a wooden box

We were here for the Restaurant Week menu, and had a very pleasant evening. The place is simple, but very pleasant - quiet enough to have a private evening, elegant enough for business meetings, and I like how tables are set comfortably far apart, which in recent times, is becoming hard to find in other restaurants. Service was very good - fast (Without being pressurising), polite, friendly. Everyone was cheery and helpful. The food - everything was great, from the bread (including their French butter), the Rib Eye, the Snapper, and even the sides were beautifully done. I am not very fond of Bailey's ice cream, but the Chocolate Dome they served today with Baileys Ice cream inside, was a great balance of flavours. Great place to go to, lovely and pleasant, we will be back :
4
A lovely grill with quiet ambience and the steak is very nice. Weekdays order from the main menu etc n you are entitled to free flow of wine for 2 hours. Weekends any wine is 50% off subject to terms but well worth it if you love your booze n steak. The side dishes are all worth trying as well from the mushrooms to truffle fries or the mac and cheese.
4
We went for the PRIME CUTS + WINES deal and tried the dry-aged steak! There was so much and we couldn't finish the sides. Smoked risotto has a nice smoky taste but when it was came was undercooked. So we requested to cook it more to be al dente. Free flow of wine from 7pm - 9pm
4
Very good service and food in excellent ambientBusiness dinner, customer satisfiedSides served later respect main courses. Smoked risotto below expectationVery good wines serve

Restaurant provided excellent customer service, served good food. The steaks are cooked well but they are quite bland.

The title says it all , fantastic experience in a wonderful atmosphere.went there last sunday with friends , we do not miss home anymore.Food was simply delicious , macarons were the best I ve ever had , seafood is a pure delight , wide range of cheese selection for all taste.Let's make it simple , it is a tremendous experience with premium service.Hope to see you there , cause I ll definitly come back..But seriously tho , those macarons....
5
Entire cheese room waiting to be devoured, Special award for the lamb chops perfectly medium red cooked, smooth and tasty. Set up quite clever, high quality of service no doubt you are having lunch at Hilton, will come back. Very good value for money.
5
I went there with my friends and this place was just spectacular. Impeccable service - Dorothy our serveur was so attentive, I never had to ask for anything, my wine glass was just automatically refilled without me even noticing. The food spread was wonderful - lovely mix of Western European and oriental. I especially loved the seafood buffet - the crabs were a delight. The lobster bique and double broiled chicken soup were so so great for a Sunday hungover the cheesecake was the perfect cherry on top (it did actually have very fresh cherries on top). I actually asked if they had a certain kind of crab as well, which they didn't have on the buffet spread, but the chef made it specially for me (and it wasn't even my birthday or some occasion, they just have great service). Will definitely come back. I left feeling like I just didn't have enough stomach space for it!! Strongly recommend this.
5
Good for famillies, friends or couples. The atmosphere is very nice and the food it s worth than a five stars restauran
5
Me and my friends went to Opus Grill last weekend for the Sunday brunch, the free flow of food and alcohol made our bellies explode! We are still recovering at this very moment, but it was worth it. I especially recommend the cheese, seafood and beef, not necessarily in that order. Service was awesome, special thanks to Dorothee

The evening was pleasant overall. The Hilton has limited parking which meant that with the carpark full we had to choose to valet or park else where. Valet was $10 flat fee. The restaurant was surprising empty on a Saturday evening and seating was prompt. The atmosphere was warm if a little dimly lit. There was a family seated behind us and the kids were a little noisy and ran about at some point in the evening. We had the fois gras and the scallops to start. The portion for the fois gras was generous but the scallops (3 full scallops) was the star of the evening. We also tried the dry aged Omaha beef and the Australian Kobe beef Wagyu both cooked medium rare with a side of Arugula salad. The beef was grilled to desired doneness and was flavourful but not spectacular. For desserts we had the grilled banana, coconut and calamansi ice cream and an additional order of the chocolate bomb. The coconut and calamansi had an intriguing and surprisingly pleasant flavour. The chocolqte bomb was dramatic with hot chocolate and liquer poured over the chocolate ball/bomb into a melted soup revealing chunks of raspberries and hints of alcohol with every spoonful. The wine selection was reasonable and wonderful to know it was an evening promotion for any ala carte main ordered resulting in a 50% discount on the first bottle of wine. Overall the meal was pleasant without being spectacular and the atmosphere was reasonable with the exception of the young kids being a distraction. Service staff was generally attentive and was nice that the food did not require explanations nor did they interrupt the meal with regular check-ins on how the meal was as in some restaurants. A nice place, not crowded and food quality was good but not anything to rave about. Price is on the expensive side with the evening running up a tab of over $400 for 3 pax. a bottle of red wine, 2 chef recommended set dinners and an order off the ala carte menu.
5
A perfect place to dine... simple yet cozy ambience. The staff were great and their service is superb, from the reservation to the dinner itself. The set menu was good and their Kobe Cuisine Australian Wagyu is really worth a try. The whole experience was great and it made my sister's birthday celebration more special

One of our friends tried this restaurant a few weeks ago and was impressed enough to return with the rest of us. The steaks are cooked over a charcoal open flame grill. The four of us shared the 800g Rangers Valley Angus OP rib for two persons, and the 1.2kg T-bone steak for two. The portions combined are enough to feed 6 persons actually. Both were rather fatty for my taste, but you can cut away the fat. I also preferred medium to the medium rare we chose which was too pink for me. But overall it was good beef, helped by the various types of sauces and flavored salts provided which enhanced the taste. The side dishes, all reasonably priced at $6, were very good - green salad, portobello mushrooms, asparagus and truffle fries. Our starter of Irish oysters were good as well. The place is classy and conducive for conversations which tables well spaced out. The free flow promotion of sparkling, red and white wine if you order more than $58 per person helps keep the meal affordable, although I didn't like the sparkling and white wines and stuck to the red merlot. I will try the tenderloin beef on my next visit. They also serve grilled fish, chicken, lamb, pork belly and wagyu burger.

I've been here twice for brunch now over the past few years, the food never fails to disappoint - delicious and so much quality choices. This time though the drinks service wasn't up to scratch considering the price. In addition to having empty glasses a number of times, we were told at 240pm that it was last drinks in preparation of the buffet closing at 3pm. I would have assumed that paying good money for champagne from 12 to 3pm meant we would have champagne until 3pm - asked to speak to a manager but were told that's how it was. Hmmm

Steak ordered was so thinly sliced that it looked like it was a leftover..dessert was nothing spectacular n overall, spent close to 200 for 2 pax. Poor value for

been to this stunning restaurant for a good 4 times? never once did it disappoint. reservation can be made online. this place serves good dry-aged beef topped up with free flow of wine/sparkling water as long the meal cost over 50 bucks. I do not think anywhere in Singapore can you find such a deal since wine and beef are inseparable. see the chefs in action and the Himalayan salt tile cabinet right smack in the middle of the restaurant.their signature ranger valley Angus beef serves a good 2 pax. with that, both you and your partner gets to enjoy free flow of wine.You will be able to choose 3 types of sauce from its menu, with the black truffle and mushroom sauce being my favorite. HImalayan salts are served as well if you require them. After being seated, the staff serves fresh out of the oven cheese bread.a special imported steak knife will be presented to you if you order beef. talk about service! our wine glasses never once ran out and is constantly being topped up by the ever friendly and attentive service crew. they serve with a smile and occasionally ask how is the food. not many restaurants do that nowadays although some call themselves "fine-dining". i think it means a lot. they even prepared a complementary cake for my mum when we brought my parents for celebrate the occasion :)one of the finest place i have been to in my entire life, no kidding! good food and good service. the prices are not sky rocket high, but they definitely serve with passion!10/10 for me! P.S : if you don't drink wine, they do substitute it with fresh fruit juice as well
5
Went there with 2 friends for weekend brunch. Free flow alcohol which Christine the wonderful server gladly topped up for us each time our glass was empty. Christine is the epitome of great customer service; always smiling and joked with us each time she came to the table. Very very warm. Food was excellent; oysters, foie gras which was amazing, roast beef, wide range of different cheeses to choose from, just to name some. The selection was great! Had a wonderful afternoon there and will no doubt return!!!

Over the years I have been to many brunch buffets but this one in Singaore has it to a tea.The price is one of the best around with the option of a couple of drinks to free flowing champain, the choice is yours.The food is out of this world, if you like seafood it has it all. The same goes with the meats there is such a choice. The cheese board has over 30 different ones to choose from. The deserts are hand made pieces of perfection.There is a small counter serving their home made scotch egg. It's a warm scotch egg as they are made in front of you and the taste is amazing, could not put my finger on the secret ingredient but they were amazing.There are curries, salads, breads the choice is simply bewildering. To sum up, excellent staff, stunning variety of food, loads of it, full of locals which means its good, book so you get a space

The Wagyu Ribeye was one of the best meat I had, charcoal grilled with the smokey flavorful taste. Served medium rare, meat was tender, and the sides asparagus was superb for a non-asparagus lover like me. Had free flow of wines but I thought that the wine could have been better with other selections. Pierre Jean seemed too main stream
5
Had dinner at Opus during Singapore Restaurant Week in March and were very happy with the experience, the food, and the service. The setting is modern with open seating, a bit like a Dining hall and not the best place for a romantic date. The Food was good in taste and the presentation 5Star (look at the pictures). An nice Restaurant, likely to return during another Restaurant Wee

Great value for money. Lots of variety and seafood was really fresh. Loved the oysters and lobsters a lot.

As part of the meeting package, we were served lunch at the restaurant. This restaurant occupied a small area on the ground floor and in my personal opinion, certain areas, particularly around the buffet spread; was a little crammed. The spread was well grouped and given its lack of space, the food selection was extensive enough. I wish they had a wider selection of fruit though. I also experienced difficulty getting myself some baguette slices as the necessary tools were not available to make it easy. On the day I was there, I only had the knife but not the cloth that is usually wrapped around the bread. I obviously had to try the cheesecake since the hotel was quite renowned for it. Service was genuine and attention was paid to us whenever necessary, especially coming from Kris. He pleasantly obliged and accommodated when we asked that a chair be placed at our table though it was not meant for 5 people. Thank you, Kris for a pleasant experience.

The steak was nicely done and generous serving size. The mashed potato and portobello mushroom sides were excellent! Service staff was diligent in making sure that our wine was top up. All in all, a superb value
5
Nice ambience. Good service and pleasant staff. Attentive manager. Nice wine. Good food. The t bone steak was lovely and the Burnside and truffle sauce was lovely. Especially like the truffle fries and the mashed potatoes were lovely and smooth. Nice night with nice wine and nice company. Thanks Opus for making it a lovely night overall
4
Last night in Singapore so just stayed in Hilton. We went to Opus with no great expectations. Very nice ambiance in a minimalist way. attentive staff.Steaks came with complimentary and very pleasant red wine. Steaks were excellent.Cost 400 Sing$ for 5 - pretty good for a high end hotel
5
Given the location in a top hotel, we were pleasantly surprised to find the restaurant value for money. Food was delicious and elegantly presented. The best part was 50% discount for a bottle of wine as we ordered steak which was cooked perfectly as well. Definitely would come back again
5
We had the buffet at Opus during our visit to Singapore. The buffet spread is so vast with so many live preparations!The desserts are a must-try!!! with different types of sweets and fruits, this place definitely has everything to cater to your sweet tooth
5
Amazing food and service as usual! The t bone steak was lovely and so were the truffle fries, broccoli and garlic mash side. The free flow wine also made the meal very worth it. Service staff were very attentive and very nice, will visit soon again
4
Have been to the restaurant three times since it opened and tried various dishes. The one that truly stands out is the 1-1.2kg T-Bone steak for two. Most diners would go for the 800gm dry aged OP ribs which is also for two since it has a higher marbling score. I prefer the texture and the taste of the T-Bone steak so even at 1kg, it was effortless to polish off the whole thing by two persons. The paprika salt definitely complements the steak but I can't say I enjoyed the sauces nor the other types of salt. Service is impeccable as always. The service staff are always friendly and professional. Its worth a visit if you love steaks and they are running a free flow of wines for two hours promotion now
5
This is the ongoing hotel breakfast & Lunch restaurant, but in the evenings it is an open grill restaurant serving a wide variety of grill dishes prepared fantastically to create wonderful experience to the carnivores among you
5
I was here for my girlfriend's birthday and I really it was totally worth it! called in advance and they even provided complimentary slice of delicious cheese cake as the birthday cake ! Being steak lovers we ordered the 220g wagyu grade 6 n it was one of the best steaks we had in sg. service was tip top staff were constantly asking us if everything was ok. totally worth the money I spent . keep it up!
4
We went for the steak promotion set with 2 hours of free wine. Service was great and servings of the wine were generous. Sauces not good though
5
Excellent food, service & amazing setting! The steak and sauces were pretty amazing, and the bread was out of this world. We were there to celebrate my dad's birthday and I think he was very very pleased. We will definitely be back
5
The quality of the food and level of service caught us by surprise far exceeding our expectations. With just an overnight stay in the Hilton we decided to dine on the premises. The steak was tender but flaversome and expertly cooked. The range of sides, seasoning and sauces complemented the meal very well. We would certainly eat there again
5
Had my dinner here and was very happy with the gastronomic performance. This is an amazing streak house situated in Hilton hotel with very good quality beef. They dry-age their own OP rib and you can watch as everything is prepared for you.Service staff is very good in guiding you through the various options on the menu, and making sure that you get the experience you are looking for. The chefs cooked my OP rib to perfection and it was out of this world good!!! Juicy and flavorful as an OP rib should be! Well prepared sides and tasty sauces! Can definitely recommend this place, and make sure to let them guide you so you can experience their professional knowledge and unique food
5
Being a steak lover, I've been sniffing out the scene in Singapore for years. I would rate opus as one of the top within this price range. Will definately be visiting them again soon
3
We went there for the steakPaid $88 for the Wagyu I would expect it to be nicely seasoned but it's way too saltyHad to send back twice and still gotten a sub standard steak which I could have easily get a decent one at a fraction of a cos
3
Visited Opus twice over the past two months. The first experience was brilliant. The medium OP Rib was perfectly cooked and service was impeccable. However, my second visit last night was disappointing. Ordered a medium OP Rib that was served burnt and almost well done. The steak wasn't sent back considering that it was a celebratory dinner, but I certainly won't be back anytime soon for burnt and well done steaks.
2
I stayed in the Singapore Hilton for two weeks on a row for a business trip. Had a few dinners outside the hotel but ate most of the time inside due to long working days. Tried the Opus Grill two times and both were disappointing. The Grill advertises with ageing their meat themselves but to be honest the quality of the meat is very disappointing: tasteless piece of shoe sole. You might be ageing your own meat but if you dont buy quality to start with then the ageing is not going to help you. For the current price level one could expect some goog meat. Good choice of wines and correct staff. The Italian restaurant at the top is way better: outside seating when weather permits, good wines and excellent Italian food and romantic for couples. Very attentive staff too

Usually at a buffet, some eatery may sacrifice delight for variety, not at Opus Bar & Grill. I'm a fan of waking up for Sunday Brunches, and Opus Bar & Grill is delightful. I This is my first visit to Opus Grill, and apart from having read good reviews about the brunch, I didn't know what to expect. The oysters selection are heavenly, seafood spread is marvellous, if you are a fan of cheeses and ham, this is your pod.Grill department is commendable, if you are needing protein to start the week off, this is it. Meat grilled to your choice of perfection. I wanted a cut of the roast beef that's medium rare...and I got it.Foie Gras for those who are defying cholesterol for a moment of indulgence, try it both ways there, pan friend and served as a canape. Overall, i walked away feeling satisfied, and am wondering menu will change periodically. Overall, the group that I was with, a mix of singaporeans, koreans and hong kongers found this brunch hearty and well worth it
5
Our name was not on the reservation list. The manager found us a table without much embarrassment. The restaurant appeared full. Sunday brunch with the Champagne option was probably the best meal time experience I've had. Fantastic service, incredible assortment, beautiful display and presentation. All you can eat lobster, fresh shucked oysters, jumbo crab legs, sushi as well as an assortment of the sushi fish, cooked to order lamb chops, fillets and Japanese beef, maybe 20 different kinds of gourmet cheeses, breads, olives, Italian and Spanish hams, decadent desserts and a Roderer (sic) Champagne glass that was never empty. A splurge that was a bargain. Almost forgot, help yourself foi gras
5
Wonderful experience. From the warmth of the welcome to the help with the menu to the friendliness throughou

Within 2 short weeks, I was at Opus on 2 seperate occasions. Very nice place, newly renovated. Good staff, prompt service and generally very accommodating. But the food, the highlight of its menu, the steaks turned 2 different way.I ordered the Opus steak for 2 ($120 per serving) on both occasions;First time - good and juicy, tender and flavourful. second time - badly charred, bitter to the bite, overcooked inside (I ordered medium). I sent 2 pieces of it back to the kitchen. What irks me was that the waiter came back and said that the chef said it was due to the "caramelisation of the exterior", and thats how it is. I was very disappointed to be treated this way with such a lame reason. Its burnt, full stop, what kind of caramelisation is that? Maybe when the caramel is burnt! I insisted to have it returned for a new one. Although it came back pretty well later, it is already one step behind everyone else in the group and we could only managed half of it.In ending, the server waived (we didnt ask for it, excuse me) the order of the 3 sides ($18 in total)Nonetheless, I hope that it is just one off. Maybe I should give it another chance
5
Celebrated a friend's dinner @ Opus. As soon as we were seated, we were asked if we wanted warm water. Yes! The onion bread was yummy! Liked the set dinner menu variety - couldn't decide on my choice of starters of tuna tartar, Hokkaido scallops or foie gras. The set dinner portion was just right. Food was good as was the creative plating. The desserts were different and we enjoyed it - grilled banana with calamansi/coconut ice cream
5
I visited OPUS 3 times in the past 2 months. First time, the Angus OP Rib was a bit on the rare side. The Chef said he could do a bit more 'well' if that was what I wanted, On my 2nd visit, he did exactly that, and it was excellent. The 3rd visit was 2 nights ago, and the quality remained ... as excellent as ever. This is the place to enjoy a tasty piece of beef.The Chateaubriand was good on my 1st visit, but not so on my 2nd visit. However, OPUS redeemed itself on the 3rd visit with an excellent preparation. I was told that I did not pre-order on my 2nd visit and therefore, the preparation was not as excellent as it should be
5
My husband and I had an excellent dinner at Opus tonight. My starter was scallops with a pea purée. And for a main I had a fillet steak with sauce béarnaise. Both dishes were absolutely delicious! And what made them even more amazing was they were prepared without garlic because I am allergic to garlic. The staff were attentive and looked after us really well. We enjoyed our evening so much that we have booked again for the evening before we leave Singapore
4
Prior to my dinner appointment, I was invited to make my pre-order so that my fiance and I would be served quickly. The email correspondence were friendly and prompt. When we arrived at the restaurant, we were greeted warmly at the reception and brought to our table. The service staff were attentive and polite. The food served for restaurant week was awesome. We had the Angus steak with king prawn for mains and we enjoyed it thoroughly. Overall, we enjoyed our dining experience at Opus and we had great conversation throughout
5
worth visiting again for desert which are house in the fridge which you can hardly see else where. good serving of oysters and live station of grill lamp chop and tenderloi
5
Having been to many champagne lunches in Singapore, I have to say, this is one of the best. Firstly, the champagne is Louis Roederer. One of my faves, and one of the best NV champagnes around. And if you like a Bloody Mary, grab one freshly made from the drink cart traveling the room. Then comes the food. Highlights are the Scotch egg, freshly sliced Iberico, jabby macheroni, and an awesome cheese selection. And there is the usual seafood station, great salads, the grill and an awesome dessert bar. And a personal welcome from Angel Hu, the food and beverage manager, was lovely. You will not be disappointed.
5
It was an enjoyable evening, from start to end. Service staff were polite and attentive and food was really great value. We had the 800g beef to share and that was awesome! I highly recommend
5
The steak was delicious! Love the free-flow wine (part of promo). Nice place. Low-key. Not pretentious
4
The steak was really good. And the promotion was really worth it. Had a great night out with a friend
4
I enjoyed a steak dinner at Opus during my recent business trip to Singapore. One thing that attracted me was the special offer of freeflow wine if you ordered a steak. The free flow red wine, I have to say, was an absolutely appalling French Bordeaux that made me shudder as I tried it. I explained to the restaurant supervisor/manager, Angel, that I could not drink it and said I would like to order a glass of the Chilean Cabernet Sauvignon even if it meant giving up free wine. Well, on signing my bill after dinner the charge for the glass of wine had been waived as a discretionary token of goodwill since I was not able to avail myself of the freeflow. It is a small cost to the hotel, though probably less than giving away multiple glasses of the Bordeaux, but the gesture was greatly appreciated and showed a high desire to ensure a guest left with - pardon the pun - a good taste in the mouth. Very much appreciated
4
Great food and wine served. Very polite staff who are attentive to our needs. Had a very enjoyable evening.
5
Superb meal with great customer service!Quality added with freshness of the seafood plus different region of oysters.Wow
4
 A very good service with quality spread of seafood with main course plus dessert. The staff were accommodating and patient with 1st timer like myself taking a sumptuous free flow champagne brunch
4
We have now visited the Opus Bar in the Hilton Hotel on Orchard Road a few times. It is a well designed and comfortable bar and not too dark as some bars seem to be these days. It is perfectly OK to enjoy a tea or coffee as well as an alcoholic drink. There is a very good cake shop attached. The menu is very clear and the service was consistently friendly and efficient. The prices are not cheap but if you consider the location of the bar it was never going to be. Give it a try I honestly think you will be pleased you did
4
Food has good spread and of high quality. Foie gras was great but the Alaskan crab legs were strangely quite tasteless. Cheese selection was fantastic, more than 20 to choose from. But they were out of tenderloin steaks at one point, however. If I have go pick on something, it is that the ambience was a bit noisy and crowded, not quite what I was expecting when I picked this place to celebrate Valentine's day with my wife. Was hoping for a lazy quiet Sunday brunch, but this is not the case, so take note
4
good food with a good ambience. Prep to order food was not too particularly impressive as the steaks were overcooked (Tenderloin & Flank) but the other food were very well done!Foie gras was good as well as the cold seafood choices were good with exception of the king crabs which were a tad tasteless. Desert was brilliant and all tasted good.Will be back for sure
4
Nice Sunday Brunch for Valentine's Day. Staff are very attentive. When my wife and I highlighted that the foie gras is undercooked, the service staff immediate feedback to the chef and make a replacement for us.
4
The steaks are decent but not the best that I've had. staff are very attentive and helpful. Provided a complimentary slice of cake to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday. =
5
Very spacious and nice restaurant. The waitress was very professional to recommend the various food and wine avavilable. The steak was very delicious and goes well with the red wine.
5
One of the best buffet brunch! Excellent wine & food. Their amazing selection of cheese & dessert were my favorite. The staff were very friendly (except the female barista)
5
We have visited a few of the buffet places in SGP (Shangri-La, Hyatt, Mandarin Oriental, Pan Pacific) and I like this one best. The concept of helping yourself from 20-30 different kinds of food works particularly well if you have visitors from another side of the world - it gives everyone a chance to try different local or international dishes. The presentation of the food was outstanding. I recommend this place for the largest selection og cheese and sweets seen so far (they even served small sweets frozen in liquid nitrogen), amazing dim sum, and excellent selection of lobster, oysters and crab. There was less Indian food and sushi than in other buffets, but still an amazing selection. There was also a separate line of expats queuing for freshly made scotch eggs :) Nice, comfy tables with plenty of room, elegant and modern interior. The restaurant itself is not too big, which makes it not so noisy and a good place for date and conversation. Price wise - it's excellent value for money. Service was excellent, booking was quick, really easy and the booking team (managed by Angel) is also extremely helpful and friendly. A great brunch experience
5
Excellent attention and fantastic ambience. Good food lovely wine. Staff was friendly and not too hard on the walle
5
Again some fantastic steak, seafood starters and an excellent wine. The entire menu regularly gets varied. From steak sauces, sides, starters. The new chefs selection menu is nice but the serving sizes are noticeably smaller than ordering similar al carte dishes
5
Bought the dry aged prine rib and it was fantastic. Truffle mushroom sauce with asparagus and truffle fries. Meat cooked to my specification and service was great. Will be back very soon
4
I'm not a big fan of buffets, but here you could find everything you wanted: from Italian, over French, over Indonesian and Japanese food. This room is also used for breakfast: some of the staff were very attentive, observant and friendly. Some of the staff were just putting in the hours
5
My Girlfriend and I ordered our starters, the king prawn skewer and the foie gras. Both were extremely good . Especially the foie gras , it goes well with the duck jus and condiments that paired with it like the brioche. Main course was the 800g bone in op rib. It was grilled to perfection with the charred flavour that simply melt in your mouth! Great steakhouse with a great view to watch the chefs in action.Another thing that enhanced my dinner experience is the service rendered by Edza. She poised herself well with her wellarticulated English and product knowledge of the item she's selling and she even persuaded me to try most of the dishes that I ordered. She was simply amazing and is a true gem to the service industry. It was an amazing experience. Thank you !
5
I have a totally wonderful experience with Opus Bar & Grill. They have wonderful and friendly staff who are so well-trained in whatever they do.They have a great variety of delicacies, like the Seafood served were so fresh that the meat tasted real sweet. The other meats were so tender that it makes you wanting to have more of them! The price is not quite affordable but it is worth it! Remember to make your reservation before visiting :)Thank you Opus Bar & Grill, and all your servicing staff for the wonderful experience
4
I met a friend at the bar, as I often do when I'm at the Hilton. It's causal, comfortable and near the Orchard MRT station. After a renovation, the bar looks bigger and a lot more cozy. New furniture and wooden touches to the walls make it very homy. As for the menu, it's fairly standard and what you'd expect from a hotel like the Hilton. The staff are friendly and serve you quickly.
5
Steaks are great with the different salt, sides like the whip potato are fanstatic.... kinda miss the platter though, hope they bring the platter back to the table....oh the grilled banana is heavenly!
4
Was with my friends at Opus today. When we 1st walked in, there was a lot of smoke coming out from the kitchen area. We thought the fire alarm was going to go off any time, but the situation was under control quite swiftly.Once seated, we started off with the champagne before going for the food. We weren't sitting at the main area, so getting the appetisers was really convenient, just a stretch of the arm and we got them. The variety of food choice wasn't much, but quality is awesome!Wouldn't mind coming back again during special occasions
4
Amazing selection and flavours, very nice staff, good decor and atmosphere. Food was excellent with a huge choice of food and dishes. Will leave very content and pleased.Well worth it if you have the time
4
As part of my annual tradition of a champagne brunch birthday celebration, I chose Opus to be the venue for 2015. I was here on 20 December and it was a memorable celebration from the bubbly, food, right down to the complimentary birthday cake! My party of 6 was very well taken care of by the very hospitable and professional staff. Though the range of food wasn't as extensive as some of the other Champagne Brunches I've been to, everything they had was of premium quality! The oysters were superb (though it ran out midway through the serving and maybe that's why), the meats were awesome and the deserts were indulgent! The bubbly served was great and the icing on the cake was the complimentary birthday cheesecake which Hilton is renowned for, Very good value for money and definitely worth a visit
5
I had by breakfast as well as Dinner here and loved the Tandoori Chicken Skewers in the evening. you have good corners available in the outlet to sit at calm and enjoy your food/drin
5
We went there for Sunday brunch @ 13 Dec 2015. The cold seafood section were excellent. Oysters, prawns, etc were fresh. Hot station food like seared foie gras, scallops, orange sauce with seabass, etc were tasty.There are more than 10 type of cheese, 5/6 type of ham/bacon, variety selection!!Highly recommended!
5
Tried the Sunday brunch (13th dec 2015). Great service by the F&B team. The food is excellent couple with great ambience. All in all we had a great time
5
Nice ambience, great steak, awesome staff. Many unique cocktails as well, would recommend the kaya cocktail
4
Good restaurant-perhaps more like a café style. Nice escargot for starter and a lovely pork belly for main course. Red banana with ice cream for dessert . Ok servic
4
Tried the Champagne Brunch today (15 Nov 2015), and we all had a great time! Items that stood out for us: the oysters were fresh, seared foie gras tasty and the lamb chops were succulent. The Louis Roderer champagne was excellent accompaniment to the food :-) We'll be back

Sunday brunch - Very disappointing in terms of service & variety. Read about their brunch on 2 different blogs, decided to try it – bad idea! There were only 3 types of oysters, and there was nothing shucked when the brunch started. There was such a long queue to get your oysters. We waited for about 15-20mins. When it was our turn, the lady chef taking the orders rudely said: “3 of each. 9 plus 9, so u want 18??” Erm, yes thanks. In fact I’ll order 40 for myself if this guy shucks fast enough. Did he learn how to shuck oysters just last week? And if he’s this slow, maybe the oysters should be shucked a little beforehand? I saw quite a few people dropping out of the queue when I was there. When I was in the queue, all I saw was that surly lady dumping new oysters onto the buckets on the counter in the most boorish manner. She also brushed past me rudely when she wanted to refill the lemon wedges – was it necessary? All I was thinking was – What put this lady in such a foul mood at 12.15pm? Does she know she still has another 2hrs and 45mins? Oh no! Only 1 type of white wine, and 1 red available. And these inexpensive wines can be readily found in supermarkets in sg. We ordered our proseccos before we went to get our food. 15mins later, we see 2 empty glasses on our table. Confused, I thought it was some sort of self-service system for the drinks, but each time I went to the wine station to ask about our drinks, I would be brushed off, saying it will be served. I had to walk to the wine station 3 times before we were eventually served by one of the managers (same guy who was at the door). When our 2 glasses of proseccos finished, it was yet another frustrating 15mins of trying to get any waitperson’s attention. Once again, I had to walk to the wine station to get someone to refill our glasses. So we’ve sat there for about 45 mins, more than half of which was spent trying to get SOME service – not great.Next, I went to try the scotch egg, which I’ve heard sooo many good things about. Go up there and cheerily ask for a serving. Greeted by another grumpy lady chef. They’ve got some unhappy people working here! Tried the grill next. It was nice to have the chef approach u and tell u about what’s nice, what’s available. He recommended the tenderloin and the lamb chop. I ordered a piece of tenderloin (small piece, 1 inch thick) and 1 piece of lamb chop (pointing to the rack they have on display). The order is served to the table – another nice touch. Beef was succulent and lamb was tasty. However, I’m left wondering what happened to our discussion of thickness of the meats? Both were only 1 cm thick – strange way to serve your meats in a grill restaurant, where u would want to showcase your meats.In summary, I thought most of the staff (chefs & waitpeople) were generally unfriendly and not the most customer-oriented. I noticed one of the manager (guy at the door) doing a lot more than others. He was clearing plates, topping up drinks, folding napkins. But when all the managers were away, the same problem came up again – no wait staff in the vicinity, can’t get any service. The best service I got was probably from this temp staff, when I asked her where the Ladies was, and she offered to take me there. I felt I was in some 2 or 3 star hotel, definitely not Hilton

My wife and I decided to try this restaurant in Hilton which is at the quiet corner of Orchard Road. We wanted some respite from the thronging crowd and I had recalled reading a very good review of this newly opened restaurant in the local papers .The ambience was generally pleasant. The place was done up with soothing hues and all the modern aesthetic. It was spacious, open and comfortable. The air seems a bit dense though and my wife remarked that she felt the air was slighly stuffy. Service is warm and polished. The affable staffs were always on hand and seem to be all out to please.I had a starter of their signature sticky pork belly in potato and leek gravy, with roasted baby potato and wild betel leaf. The pork was tender, with the right balance of fats and meat and when eaten with the gravy, gives just the right tangy note that I enjoyed.For my main course, I chose the wagyu beef burger as I was hungry. The burger was hulking, enough to feed 2. The beef is of good quality and chopped roughly, which I enjoyed as there is bite in every corner of the patty. The bun was toasted just right. The other condiments in the burger were middling though, the burger could be crispier and the onions were slightly overdone. If these can improve, it would definitely move this up a notch. The accompanying fries was excellent. Lovingly made and ultimately satisfying.The desert of Grilled Elstar apple is essentially a crispy puff pastry, creme fraiche , toasted oats and marzipan. Simple but tasty.Overall, a very nice dining experienc
5
There is a new Sunday brunch buffet and it is impressive even by the elevated Singapore standards. Truly top quality and vast choice of superb and top of the line offerings, really worth a visit
4
This review is for the Sunday Brunch.Absolutely excellent variety and value. For SGD100 all in, one gets an exquisite selection of items, including italian sopressata, jamon iberico, fine de claire oysters, alaskan king crab and a fantastic prime rib. We were told by the Chef it was a new menu, which in fact was better than what i recalled a year ago (which wasn't bad in itself, just not as good). Some fine tuning is required -the truffle scotch egg is a good idea, but needed to be cooked a bit longer; the homemade pasta had a touch too much garlic-, but really a bountiful. Sadly was too filled to try the plethora of beautiful cheese shapes.There's also a nice Bloody Mary with infused vodkas as a starter. Great experience and you won't leave hungry like you would in a lot of pseudo fancy places
5
After our long day, my family decided to try the new Steak restaurant at Hilton Hotel. We are craving for nice cut of steak, we ordered the Angus Ribeye & T-bone with side dishes. It's a huge cut of Rib bone-in. My father loved it and no doubt it was cooked to perfection. Though we've waited for it for almost an hour. Staffs are very friendly & attentive. A lady in white is also knowledgeable in all the dishes and explained all well. They also gave as complimentary cheesecake for my sister's birthday. Overall it was a nice fine dinner. If we got a chance we will come back again
5
By far the best breakfast I ever had, the options of food is very good and offers selection like western, indian, Chinese, Korean and Japanese food. Service was attentive and friendly, gets busy for breakfast when having groups.
4
Decor/Ambience - 4/5The dining area was appropriately lit for a comfortable evening. Suitable for a couples night, or a relaxed intimate dinner.Service - 5/5Serving staff were quick to attend to our queries, and came by to ensure if there was anything they could do to improve our dinner experience. A caveat here: the restaurant wasn't fully booked.Food - 4/5I would highly recommend the pork belly and the tempura onion rings. Both were extremely delightful dishes. The pork belly in particular was a highlight, tender and full of flavour.The wagyu beef was disappointing. We asked for the steak to be done medium, but it was first served well-done. After we sent it back, the replacement was more medium-rare. Considering that the wagyu is highly marbled, serving it medium-rare wastes the juices from the marbling, and can get a little difficult to digest after a couple of bites
3
The quality of food was good but it was bit hard to get the attention of the waiters. We had the SG50 set dinner priced at $50++ and still had to pay extra $20 for the Angus Grain Fed Beef. I feel this was too excessive. Since this is to celebrate SG50 then be generous about it or not offer this item if the restaurant is concerned about the hefty cost
4
Decided to try this restaurant on Sunday evening. Nice decor and atmosphere. The open kitchen with the grill was a nice feature.The food was good - especially the pork belly which was a hit with everyone.The wine list is a bit limited but we still found a nice Shiraz.If you are staying at the Hilton I'd recommend a visit
2
i want to know why it is so hard to get real service in SG. i mean this. from a previous life in the wine and food industry, how can service be so entirely void here. we were speaking freely in front of our server about starters... mentioned the stuffed zucchini flowers, decided we'd go for them.. when she says:"oh, we are out of those..." anyway, won't bore you. it is a steak house, we ordered medium, it cam rare/med rare at the ends. had to redo a whole steak. cheese plate? we ordered three of the four offered, surprise surprise.. no fontina... it was a trainwreck at the end of the day. and, positive that when they brought the bill they would say something like:"hey, so sorry, the steak is on us tonight"... nope. NOTHING. that's until i had a word with the manager. PEOPLE- if you are out of stock, say it right away. come back and ask how the meat is cooked... these things are basic. someone, please let me know if there is a spot here that delivers in both food and SERVICE...
4
I'm staying in the hotel and popped in for dinner on my first night here.Service is efficient but not friendly and the food was delicious. Not excited by the service but everything okay.Would return but not my first choice
5
The fellas behind the fire were so friendly & approachable! I was taking a photo behind the glass panel overlooking the fire & they actually welcome me inside for a much better shot! What else can I say

I've read gd reviews about Opus and decided to give it a go since it's a new spot in town. Food was lackluster - bread served was not warm and we feedback to the staff; they were nice enough to bring us another round but sadly it was still not as warm as we would have expected it to be (benchmark against other restaurants that serves complimentary bread) The lemon wedges that came with the oysters we ordered were too thinly sliced, which makes it hard to squeeze. There was also no teaspoon that comes with the sauce ( did u expect us to pour the sauce directly from the pot into the oyster?). The scallops and king prawns were recommended by the server, they were ok but not outstanding. I was ready to let it go as the highlight of the visit was the steak. We ordered the Kobe Wagyu beef and apart from the v nice smokiness of the steak, everything else is flat. Flavour of the beef was flat, the foie gras sauce was too sweet for a savoury meal (it tastes like sweet dark sauce with added bits of foie gras). We ordered medium fineness but it was slightly overlooked. Unfortunately I'm not impressed at all and I would not return. I hope the feedback will help improve the food quality and overall service/operation and then maybe I will go it another go. But in short, I would not return in the near future.

It was a delicious meal, focusing mainly on grilled meats. Seafood was also available. The breads were yummy and so were the dippings. We had seared Hokkaido scallops for starters, pork belly and Angus tenderloin for mains. The pork belly was melt-in-your-mouth and the beef was flavorful. We had a surprise and complementary slice of cake for the birthday occasion. It was a last minute request but the restaurant handled it well.

Great range of food and very good quality. Reasonably priced wine list and very good service. Worth a visit.
