Went there to try the salted egg pork ribs and it was quite alright. Was quite impressed with the spicy clams (La La) which was very tasty and price was quite decent. Expect a long queue and do go early!

Honestly I think this is one of the slightly more overpriced and overhyped meals. I like the texture of the pork ribs here - chewy and tender. However, the sauce is so one dimensional. You don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t really get enough saltiness from it and the flavour is very flat and one dimensional. It gets very cloying after a few mouthfuls. Too tasteless for its creaminess.

That was what the website said. Sadly it was from the Smart Local website, which is weak at best, insular and naive on a good day, but usually just trash written by brainwashed trend followers. Unfortunately that's about the best online guide you can get in Singapore. So, like everyone in New Station, I ordered the pork swimming in salted egg. While eating it, it was special. Off the scale unhealthy but worth it.Afterwards both gorgeous wife and I had to sit down as we wanted to spew. If your body is a temple, don't treat it like a toilet. But if you wanna get decadent, smash the salted egg pork and treat yourself to an ice cold Coke afterwards and clean yourself up

Visited during lunch, they had a good crowd but was lucky to snag a seat for two. We ordered a la carte a fried rice, their famous salted egg yolk pork ribs and a kai lan.Everything was pretty good! The pork was juicy and very saucy although I would have liked if the sauce was a bit stronger. The kai lan was nicely done although a bit greasy and the fried rice very very tasty but a bit wetter than we normally liked.Would recommend, definitely would go back to try other dishes

Generally are eatable. We were very hungry tonight.. I think vegetables are nice and also a bit to salty for the sambal kangkung. Stew tofu was so so, although the give much of sotong and prawns, prawns are not naturally crunchy. The best dish is sales egg prawns with the shell. The shell is quite soft, prawns are big. This is the best dish,
