This place is not a breakfast spot but more catered to lunch and dinner crowd. Good thing is that there are 2 adjacent parking lots to this hawker center. Quite a good variety to suit different taste buds.

Pasir Panjang food center is just a few steps from Pasir Panjang MRT, very convenient situated without the need to cross the rial, just at the door step. Besides beers, satay, tau-hu goreng, bbq chicken wings and seafood are great stuff, price are reasonable. The best food in my opinion is Singapore Rojak, which is phenomenon, no where else can find better than this. Having a catch-up meal with friends would never be disappointed. Thumbs up for Pasir Panjang hawker food with great varieties and multi-cultural foods. Apart for local generally, I think it would be a great place for tourists to experience great foods particularly our local authentic food. Guarantee a great experience for tourists with reasonable spending similar to our local spending

Tong Yi Congee is incredible! A must try in Singapore. Locals queue up for it. Always a good sign. The owner uses the freshest ingredients to create the most amazing congee and clay pots I've tasted in Asia. The frog leg clay pot with dried chilli, ginger, and onion is a winner, as is the frog leg congee clay pot. This place is awesome and totally affordable. You can get a killer bowl of congee for $3.50. It's true comfort food and always excellent. I've been coming for four years and think of this place as one of Singapore's finest local eateries. If you love congee and clay pots, the food will blow you away and keep you coming back for more.

If you stay in the west and want to come here, next to PSA. The Satay from Yusoff Haji is not bad. Freshly grilled. Li Yuan or luak or oyster omelette is the worst Ive tried so far. The egg is dry. But oyster is fresh. Alan Banana Leaves BBQ Seafood had good stingray. You want to avoid those that pregrill their stuff as the stingray will be too dry. This was just nice.Open air. Convenient with big public car park and next to MRT. Next time we will try the crab but we were very full when we checked this out.

My first time here. Decided to try the famous "Char Kuay Teow with a lot of vegetables". It did not disappoint me. The Char Kuay Teow was delicious. The texture was just nice and not too oily. And the generous portion of vegetables on top of the Char Kuay Teow balances the Char Kuay Teow perfectly. Must try

Yusoff Haji's satays are flavorful. Well marinated and very tender though it tends to be on the sweet side. The rice was a great accompaniment, moist and soft. Tahu Goreng was also a winner - served piping hot with fresh grated peanut sauce.Hua Kee's seafood is probably over-hyped. Stingray was dry and tough with mediocre chili. The lala was sweetened which seemed artificial. 2 stalls away, the oyster omelette was well fried and served with plump oysters. Ivy's mutton soup - great clay pot soup with tender pieces of mutton and tendon. Excellent soup without the gaminess of mutton.

Happened upon this place with some colleagues from work. There is a Thai place in the corner that does BBQ seafood and it is amazing value for money.Three of us has BBQ squid, Clams, and Stingray and Green beans with minced pork - I think - and roce for three. All of this for 44 bucks.The Stingray was moist and succulent, the sambal on top was pretty hot but the meatiness of the stingray could stand it. The clams were good but the squid and sauce were delicious.No Michelin stars here but just great food at very very good prices.It is worth a visit

This Malay Nasi padang stall is really very good. Their Chilli is to die for. Combination taste of sweet and mild spiciness. Complemented with the rice and dishes very well.The fried chicken is a must to order. Super yummy and tender chicken drumsticks and thighs. The two Malay ladies managing the stall are Super kind and generous. The price of a meat with two vegetables or with ikan bilis and peanuts and fried fermented soybeans etc. Price range about 3 to 3.50 sgd. really value for money. Their beef rendang and sambal cuttlefish is so yummy. I'm very grateful to this kind of hawker people who maintain the prices Low and reasonable for the common working class consumer. I will always go back regularly as I miss the two lovely Malay ladies that created so many delicious dishes. The stall starts as early as 6am. Morning dishes are lontong and Nasi lemak. You will see the morning crowd at 6am Their lontong is TOP in my view.... the gravy is authentic with the cabbage and tofu cook to perfection. Must try! Only 2 dollars,,..! Hope you will try this stall if you are there. No regrets
