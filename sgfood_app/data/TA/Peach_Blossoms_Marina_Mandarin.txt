Had lunch with some friends yesterday (21 Jan 2018) and had Dim Sum with some other dishes. There were 7 of us and the bill came to around $420. Seems pricey just for a dim sum lunch. However food was good.

THE FOOD WAS GREAT! i Love the food and restaurant. Terry and team service is sooo good. I would go back again:)
From Auyong fAMILY

The food range is fine. The staff service is good and this makes the dining experience a good one. The place is pretty crowded and reservation is needed.I must say that the price maybe a bit on the high side. Take a look at my photos taken

Visited with extended family members and ordered a substantial feast comprising yusheng, a giant steamed marble goby, roasted chicken, sweet and sour pork with lychees, braised tofu in crab sauce, vegetarian sharksfin and glutinous rice steamed in lotus leaves. Dessert was yuzu cheesecake from the coffee shop on Level 4. Everyone enjoyed the meal. There was so much food we had to take away some of the rice and the dessert. The yusheng was a Marina Mandarin specialty, comprising fruit and salmon - really worth paying a premium for. We used a dining voucher which shaved about $300 off the total bill. Final bill was about $600 - a steal, given the food was of good quality and was for 11 pax
5
Good food with equally good service to match especially from Terry & the team! Not a huge fan of Chinese cuisine but dare I say it's the best I've had so far. All round good experience :

It was a Sunday night 8pm and no reservation.Although the restaurant was really full girl at the desk was very helpful and found us a table .Our waitress Mun Fung was very helpful and I enjoyed mandarin Mojito with out the sugar and a glass of Kapuka New Zealand wine by the glass .We ordered the live pan fried prawns in oriental sauce , sensational multigrain fried rice with chilli and seasonal vegetables fungi and garlic .All in all a great fresh Chinese meal with terrific service Yes we would come back
5
We are so in love with the wonderful team! Special thanks to chef ah teck, Mr Terry, Ms Sook Teng and Ms Bowie for giving us such an amazing experience celebrating my father's 70th birthday!
5
The service and food was impeccable as per usual. Do look for Jeff! He made the experience even greater with great recommendations, his eye for detail, and adorable sweet gestures (e.g. cute plating of birthday cake)

We have been coming back here every year for birthdays and anniversaries celebration. Their high quality of food and services have been consistent
5
We organized a birthday party and a group traveled there to attend this party. From booking the venue via e-mail to the night of the party the staff were very helpful and responsive. The selection of dishes were delicious, the service way amazing and I must say for a big hotel the price was reasonable. They made it special for the group and accommodated every single request
5
Very enjoyable lunch with my friends for his birthday celebration thanks to all the friendly staffs.. to take the effort to present the cake on a plate with chinese poems...
5
Having lunch with friends. Food was delicious and price reasonable. The service staff was friendly and help making recommendations of the dim sum. Thanks to Terry Lim for the great service will definitely come back again.
5
Always like the food here when we visit. Special thanks to Bowie, Terry, Sharon and Sook Teng who made the evening a very enjoyable one, from making a reservation to payment, it was awesome.
5
Thank chef Edward chong for preparing a feast for my family. The food does not only look good but taste good too
2
Neither is the menu creative nor are the standard dishes any great. I may have given the place 4 stars had it been in a hawker center but you have different expectations from a Mandarin Hotel restaurant
5
My first visit. Had a good experience. Will return.We were seated near the entrance next to a German table with animated conversation. My request for change of table was efficiently attended to.The combination platter with prawns, cod, scallops, chicken and otah was excellent in presentation, flavours and fusion cuisine.The tea smoked chicken was moist and tasty.The prawns and scallops in spicy sauce with snow peas were fine.The charcoal beancurd with mushrooms and spinach was unique and delicious.The baby bokchoy with wolfenberries and cordyceps flowers in superior broth was light and not commonplace.The multigrain fried rice with chicken in spicy sauce was excellent
5
Had a early birthday celebration for my dad with my family & relatives at Peach Blossoms Marina Mandarin. Thanks Bowie, Nobel & Terry for the excellent services. Terry did a great flour sculpting job as a gift to my dad. Overall good service and nice environment for gathering

Peach Blossoms Located at #05-00 6 Raffles Boulevard, Marina Mandarin, There are abundance of great Cantonese Chinese restaurants in Singapore... so I feel knowledgeable to say the Peach Blossoms in Singapore is an absolutely fabulous place to spend an evening. It is a stylishly furnished Chinese restaurant that's found a home at the Marina Mandarin, with tastefully ambience, unique blend of warm and cool tones, and a modern, sophisticated very comfortable place where you can enjoy an authentic fine dining experience. It is a distinctive but good up-market Cantonese fine dining restaurant with Good service, and tasty harmonious food. What we really love about the exquisite mouthwatering Chinese cuisine is the usage of fresh, premium ingredients. One of the dish that really stand out was the Steamed Honey Glazed Pork Bun! So far Peach Blossoms has the BEST Char Siew Bao as the skin was so so fluffy that no other hotel Chinese restaurants can do it. And the filling was not too sweet. Overall it's melt in the mouth! .The restaurant also offers a Weekday All-You-Can-Eat Dim Sum lunch buffet .The price tags are definitely high, but I guess that is the way in Singapore everything is quite inflated. Lastly, thumbs up to the service, it is impeccably...very professional and sophisticated, yet friendly. Staff are very professional the service is excellent and very friendly and attentive. A perfect night. I truly recommend this place if you want high quality fine dining Fusion Chinese cuisine. Will definitely come back. Very soooon. Awesome!!

A late family dinner at Peach Blossoms was a great experience. A wide range of chinese fusion foods together with a long list of beverages. Excellent customer service. A bit pricy but worth the experience. Crispy squid and wasabi prawns were signature dishes. Dessert too were fantastic.
5
It was an awesome experience for us when we dined at the Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin Hotel) this afternoon for lunch. There were nine of us and we received excellent service from Alicia and Alden. They even looked into minute details, from serving the older folks first to the young. The food was of fine quality and we even requested for a customized dish and the chef did the dish superbly well. Definitely worth coming back. All thumbs up to the chefs, Tuck Wai and Edward and their amazing staff
5
Excellent service lead by Terry & his team, good food (value for money) & clean & comfortable environment.

Food is always good and the service from the staff - all very friendly especially Alden, Terry, Nobel, Bowie, Jeff & Sharon. You feel so at home and every meal is a happy and satisfactory one
5
Spurred by good reviews on this site, a group of us went to Peach Blossoms for dinner. The location is great with potential views of parts of the Singapore skyline (not the best parts though) and the pretty Marina Mandarin interior hotel lobby. Menu is extensive (and expensive), service excellent, and interior decor attractive (but not romantic). Place was full of groups/families; didn't see couples. Food was very good. Try the avocado/chocolate ice cream dessert to conclude your delicious meal. Strongly recommend reservations
5
Had a birthday celebration with my grandpa & relatives at peach blossoms marina mandarin. What an experience! Food is good. Service is excellent. Sook Teng took great care of us, ever look out to our needs. Terry did a great flour sculpting job as a gift to my grandpa. Tks for the wonderful memories
5
Service was excellent! We called to ask about the parking and were given very good instructions. Drinks were refilled consistently and the service crew were attentive and knowledgeable. Food wise, the range was excellent and prices were very reasonable for the quality. Overall, had a great experience and will definitely go back again

First time bring my mum for dinner,She was impressed with the ambience,the food was scrumptious and the services she received from Terry,Bowie and Jeff. They kept changing new and clean plates and refill tea without even asking.They were observant to our needs.Terry recommended new dishes like steam fish. My wife loved to eat chillies and they serve a lot of chillies.My wife finished all the chillies. Food,services,ambience,and great company made our day
5
I am not a frequent contributor but i needed to write about Peach Blossoms. The only thing better than the service was the food. The best Dim Sum I have ever had. Lookup Alden Gan the manager.and the best waitress in Singapore Mun Fung...they will look after you a trea
5
My brother in law celebrated his 60th Birthday in Peach Blossoms.The decor is nice and warm. Most of the family members were first time customers and were pleasantly surprise with the layouts and setting . The restaurant gave us a sizable and good partition for our 3 tables which was also very cozy. The serving staff (especially Ms Nobel, Bowie and Vivian) were very friendly and attentive, The manage, Mr Gan, kept popping by to ensure all things ok. The food was really nice, well presented and with good qualities. The new chef is also very creative, he presented a huge 'fruit basket' with dry ice effect and that was complementary.. really appreciate that great effort!Would highly recommend this restaurant for family, social gathering and functions.M/M Wong, Nov 11,1

The food here was fantastic and the customer service was excellent and friendly. Would totally recommend this restaurant for special occasion! Cheers! :

Had a voucher to be utilised at Marina Mandarin, so decided to splurge on dim sum. Service was fast, the prices are not cheap but the food tasted good. Had vegetarian options (thank you!!) and requests to remove spring onion were entertained
5
Would like to give Vivian Cheng a 100% thumbs up in providing a superb and excellent service all the way from the preparation time to actual event day (5 Nov 2017) in celebrating my 25th Silver Anniversary with my wife and other 45 invited family members. She was so committed and professional in giving guidance advice resulting in a memorable occasion for us. Despite she was on her annual leave, she was willing to spend time communicating with me to ensure things were carried out in meeting our needs. Thanks very much Vivian! Cheers

We had our dinner at peach blossom restaurant. The most unforgettable birthday experience we had is from terry lim ,who provided us with the best service. We love the chinese poems with the little figurines on the plate. Great food recommended by him. Really appreciated it. We will be back soon. Thank u . ：）

We have been in this nice restaurant to have a nice view of marina sands while we were eating and we have not been disappointed.The place in the 5th level of the marina mandarin hotel.We order a tea and the degustation menu A and everything was good, but definitely too expansive for the whole experience
4
We enjoyed a nice Dim Sum lunch. The best Chinese we have visited during our 2 week trips, we were surprised by the generally poor quality of food or the extremely high price for average food, so it was nice to find a restaurant were we enjoyed the meal.Not a budget conscious restaurant, half a dozen dishes cost more than $100 Singapore dollars.
5
Last night , 8 of us celebrated our good friend birthday at Peach Blossoms, Marina Mandarin. We really had an enjoyable night and delicious dinner . We were greeted by friendly staffs namely Bowei, Vivian, Nobel. and others! I must say Terry is very professional , friendly and entertaining . After we told him what kind of dishes we prefer and he recommended Marble Gorby , BBQ Meat Trio, Wasabi prawns, Wagyu beef, Fish maw, Dong Po Pork , Egg plants. We love all the dishes.

I am veey delighted to have visited this renowned rumoured restaurant from my friends and families during my visit to Singapore. The food I have tasted there is incredibly scrumptious. Undeniably, the design of the restaurant is matching and the service of the waiters at the restaurant is well and fast to response to any additional order. They smile and serve you with their all. I am very glad to have visited this restauran
5
Today my family and I went to this restaurant in lunch time We order a la carte include fish skin and sotong and some food.During our time the server who's name munfong keep smile and make some friendly service make us very happy and Terry tell us some special in Singapore make us know more about here.The food is delicious ,server very friendly we very enjoy it.Thank you Peach Blossom, thank you MMS.If we come to Singapore again we will visit here
5
Wonder how was their claypot dishes, suggest my buddies to give it a dry. We ordered 3 dishes, never disappointed us. The price was reasonable, I like the fish lips and fish maw. The braised mixed vegetables was a bit salty, may be because of fermented bean curd. As usual, service always been well taken care.

We had our wedding solemnisation and lunch held at the Peach Blossoms Restaurant in July. We chose the venue due to the Delicious & unique food, great natural lighting and beautiful interiors which showed up well in our wedding pictures.Vivian was our wedding coordinator and has made the experience a smooth sailing and stress free process. She was very friendly and responsive throughout the wedding planning process and gave lots of helpful suggestions which we very much appreciate. We enjoyed the flexibility of not having to confirm finer details eg menu, guest list till closer to the date which made wedding planning a breeze. For couples who don't want a stressful wedding planning process vs the traditional wedding banquets, I will highly recommend this place. Guests had fantastic comments on the food, we were able to customise our own menu. Feedback on the food tasting was well taken into account on the actual day which we very much appreciated. My favourite dishes were Roast chicken with dried chilli and Steamed grouper with chinese ham. Very yummy and highly recommended! Vivian went out of her way to make sure the day ran smoothly by staying back after operating hours to conduct a wedding rehearsal for us which was her own suggestion. She was very patient throughout the process. Vivian also personally help cut and plate our wedding cake and her plating skills were impressive! We had such a memorable day and will highly recommend Peach Blossoms restaurant! Thanks to the staff of Peach Blossoms who went out the way to make our day so special! We could not have asked for a better experience and venue to hold our wedding

We have just dined at Peach Blossom, unfortunately. After reading great reviews we thought we would book. One of my favourite and my husbands absolute favourite dishes is Peking Duck. We ordered 1/2 a duck, this was not carved at the table... not a problem, but what we were brought already wrapped 8 pancakes filled with a small square (8x8mm) of duck skin, just skin, no fat, no meat. We were then bought fried rice with tiny chunks of brown duck meat. Hmm wonder what happened to the breast meat if our duck? We also had the jelly fish and the XO Cod, neither were particularly good. But the Peking Duck, ridiculous :
4
Stayed at the MM hotel for two nights and tried dining at this Chinese Restaurant. Quite skilful and refine cooking especially on the roast duck and wasabi prawn. The abalone mushroom was great. Service is five star and personnel are courteous and responsive.
5
Visited the restaurant for lunch. Wasabi prawn is one of my favorite dish. I also enjoyed the dessert with dry ice effect. Their special dessert Almond cream Hands with Whole Coconut was fantastic. Service was never..never disappoint us. Keep it up
5
Our family of 11 went to the Peach Blossom at Marina Mandarin recently to celebrate my birthday. I want to thank each of its staff for making it a truly memorable one, especially Nobel, Terry, Sun Jing, Christine and Vivian. Their service was truly commendable. Terry wowed us with his Chinese calligraphy on birthday wishes on the birthday cake. The food was wonderful, as was the ambience. Kudos to the team once again
4
We stayed at the Marina Mandarin for 5 nights, but only ate once at one of its restaurants - Peach Blossoms - after reading Trip Advisor reviews. We chose off the menu, rather than having a fixed menu, and found the food to be very good, as was the service.
5
Nice environment, delicious food, friendly staff, good service.
Highly recommend to bring family and friends to enjoy the great food.
5
Nothing to complain about. Everything was perfect. Our friends were happy. Manager Terry was calm & experienced, he knew what to recommend (we were with our Taiwanese friends) & how much to order. Everyone liked the recommendations. The portions were generous. Food was really good. Excellent. Thank you Terry
5
We ate at this restaurant almost every night as it was perfect for jet lagged travelers. Quiet, nice menu with many choices. Excellent service. My husband uses crutches to walk and they were very helpful to us finding a seat with a place to store them.
5
We celebrated a birthday occasion on the 27 Aug 2017. And I am sure is a memorable one. Christine and her staff had attends to us professionally with all our need and even made a small deity of longevity with the birthday cake to mark the occasion. It really brightens the ambience it is really beyond their duties. Thanks to Christine, Terry and staff that made our evening meaningful.
4
Thanks for the lovely time given to my family and my wife for her birthday, the Wagyu rib with Black Truffle was amazing. But the presentation of the cake really 'takes the cake'! Appreciate the staff (Terry, Nobel, Sok Teng and especially Christine) that made this day special *thumbs-up
5
It was a pleasure dinner at peach blossoms , thanks Terry , Bowie, Christine for the best service ever . Thanks for the birthday cake n the Creative poem on the plate. We will definitely come back .
5
Celebrated my aunt's birthday here. Great service and the food very delicious. Sook peng and Terry made us feel like having meal at home... Not just ordinary tim sum dinning.
5
We celebrated a birthday event at this restaurant which was superb. The food was delicious but what made it more special was the efforts of the staff to make our event special. Christine who was serving us was great with her service and her birthday wishes salutations to the birthday girl. Well done Christine. Also Terry who especially made a small birthday gift fashioned in the form of miniature Chinese " Sau Pow" . was exquisitely done. Birthday girl was delighted.Well done Peach Blossom. Thank You once again for great service , great food and your wonderful staff who are always cheerful and so service oriented
5
Celebrated my mother in law's birthday here. 9 course dinner starting with the prosperity buns and ended with an amazing desert of coconut ice cream, coconut shavings, mango pudding. The vermicelli was something, as was the fish cooked in their home made sauce. Haven't had any of these dishes before this evening and I'd recommend anyone going there to check it out. To top it off, you won't find an even more attentive service crew, coupled with a Chinese rendition of a birthday poem for my mother in law at the end of our dinner. Thank you Alden, Terry, Sok Teng, Sun Jing and Christine. And thank you marina mandarin
5
We dine here every other month, celebrate birthdays, special occasions and the service is always great! Especially from Manager Terry, every attentive and offering superior service!
5
First time visit with friends. Food was nice and delicious. Service was great. It's definitely worth to go with friends or family.
5
The meal was great. Service was excellent. Care was taken in the small details. The ambience was great.
4
Wonderful Chinese fine dining with assurance of freshness and skilful cooking. The starter was great with a good mixture of cold dish. The Peking duck was well prepared. The service staff are friendly and efficient. Just felt sad to notice that the Shark Fin soup are still on the menu of this relatively well known Chinese Restaurant in Singapore. Maybe the management could be more conscious of the rampant killing of the sharks.
5
Hi management,I held a birthday celebration for my mother at Peach Blossoms.I am extremely impressed by the service given by Mr Terry. The pleasant encounter started from my phone call to booking and finally the feast itself.It is rare now to find a staff as polite and professional as Terry. My family and i are very happy with all the arrangements and extra effort put in and coordinated by her.I would not be surprised to see her rising in rank among the staff. Your company is lucky to have Mr Terry.We thank you the time
5
Decided to bring my in-laws here for my mil's birthday celebration. They did not disappoint with their food and service. Kudos to manager Terry and server Christine! They really made the day for my in laws. Thank you for making her birthday celebration special!
5
I quite impressed with the home cook dishes when invited by friend. Hokkien noodles remind me during college time in KL, Kong Bak pau not easy to find in many restaurant but at Peach Blossoms. Hope the restaurant can remain those oldies dishes. Price is reasonable and service was attentive
4
With my friends who's mum was in the hospitality business. This family goes from from good restaurant to another awesome restaurant. You name it .... this family would have been there. Tonight, it was peach blossom for the first time. Why ? I asked my friends. Both brothers, both so much into good food, wines & whiskeys. They were here to give support to their new manager, Alden Gan. He was with another Szechuan restaurant before joining this joint.This is twice in a month for them visiting the restaurant. We kicked start la la (seashell congee) with black fungus. It was an excellent soupy dish. Next comes, the Yong Tau foo. Wasn't bad as the minced pork on the bean curd had a touch of salty fish which I really like. Fried asparagus was good but the coffee pork ribs were so good. A must ... here.Wagyu beef was next, wasn't bad followed by shiitake & mushrooms, really vegetarian n seriously very tasty too.My friends were loving the Wagyu beef so much that we had another order to what everyone's appetite. Next dish surprised me ... Cantonese cuisine n their special this month was the black flat Hokkien KL style noodles. It was superb. Very very good indeed. I would have finished the plate myself, tasty n reminds me of good Hokkien mee over in the state of Kuala Lumpur.Desserts of jelly & beautiful moon cakes were served. A good night & definitely I will be back with my other friends.Service was awesome. Restaurant manager, Alden Gan just made me a satisfied customer who would drop in again any time soon. 9.5/10 for food.10/10 service.9/10 ambience.
5
Had my Solemnization luncheon here on 28 June 2017 and being served professionally by Mr. Alden Gan & his team who has provided my guest and I a very comfortable luncheon experience in Peach Blossoms (Lotus Room). Despite a slight shock to my nephew due to the waiter who accidentally drop a plate from his tray to the floor, and perhaps personally I felt that the soup was slightly salty for me. Nevertheless, the great service with delicious food and its overall ambience compensate it all. Initially we booked at 12 pm, but due to some circumstances we arrived early to the restaurant at 11.15 am in the midst of setting up the room, but Mr. Alden & his team done their best to speed up and set up everything nicely and allowed our guests to enter around 15 minutes later! Amazing! The dishes has been distributed and served individually for the convenience of our guest. We ordered a customized set meal which served 7 dishes with 1 dessert. The black chicken soup starter was delicious! Loved the Peking Duck too, was hoping for more though hahahaha! Great Mango pudding dessert! Thanks Mr. Alden & team!Summary- Food taste: 4.5 / 5- Food presentation on each plate: 4.5 / 5- Ambience: 5 / 5 - Table setup: 5 / 5- View from Lotus Room: 5 / 5 (Thumbs up! Overlooking Shenton Way.)- Room size: 4 / 5 (Slightly cramp for two big tables for 22 pax, but its still great!)- Service: 4 / 5 (Slight delay on the serving of food, in coincidence there was another private lunch too, thus the waitress & waiter have to served both rooms.)- Price: As stated $$$$, but worth it!- Overall: Deserved 5 / 5 and highly recommended for private functions
4
Visited Peach Blossom again.Noticed they have changed their menu and ordered some chef recommendation dishes to try.Still loved their peking duck and shark fin soup.Staff is always very accommodating and polite.Strongly recommend peach blossom for lunch, dinner after business and family gathering.Dr E Chow
5
Had the pleasure of celebrating my Dad's Birthday (together with Father's Day) last Friday evening at Peach Blossoms and as usual, the restaurant delivered beyond expectations.Despite the large dinner crowd, service was prompt, impeccable and always delivered with a smile. My parents were effusive in their praise of Mr Alden Gan and his service crew and that set the tone for an excellent evening,Food was exquisite and delicious, justifying its reputation as one of the leading chinese restaurants in Singapore.Thanks for a wonderful evening Peach Blossoms
5
We have try the buffet a few days ago the food was very nice and the service was excellent ,frienly value for money .
5
I am not huge fan of Chinese cousin.
Harmonious and fresh ingredients,
proper seasoning makes me hungry while I was eating.
5
Called to reserved a table for 2 at Peach Blossoms for dinner at Sunday 11/6 by a friendly manager Terry Lim. ... food was good and delicious especially the dessert was quite Creative with dry ice splitting smoke .. the staffs service was excellent and thoughtful cos when I order too much food they even remind me of it. Thinking of trying their lunch for the Tim Sum next tim
5
Great food and service. Special thanks for the manager, Terry for writing the beautiful and thoughtful Chinese birthday greeting, and hand made the God of Longevity. Not forgetting Christine and Bowie for the excellent service with a wonderful smile all the time! Thanks for making this birthday celebration a very memorable one!

Went there on a Friday with my Friend and was recommended the Chef recommended set meal and you can't believe it's from a restaurant of this standard.First after the first two dishes we had to wait more than half an hour for the next dishes while our eight ERS were already served two dishes. Second they served Wagyu beef but the sauce was too sweet and the sweetness overpowered all the taste and you couldn't even tell if it was Wagyu beef, really terrible.Third the entrance was some kind of sweet and sour fish but again it was extremely sweet as if eating sugar.Good for our long waiting the manager offered some roast meat and duck.Advise if you go to this place; don't ever order the set meal as it's really crap.Order the traditional Cantonese à la carte menu, roasted meat, dim sum or fried rice.Tasted the god as if it was hawker food and then when the bill of $217.00 came, really not worth and agreed with my Friend that better we ordered some roast meat, Cantonese soup and some vegetables.Bottom line again don't order any set meal there you'll be completely disappointed

It was the start of a six week holiday and we were so looking forward to a great first night extravanganza meal.Regrettably we were so disappointed. The restaurant was only 25% full and that should have alerted me that it is no longer popular.We chose the Set Dinner for $S62. The portions were tiny, lacked imagination and flavour. The duck entree had two tiny slivers of duck, the prawn and and scallop dish had one prawn and one scallop. The main of honey infused lamb loin had two sugar cube size portions of fatty lamb. The fried cod in a BBQ sauce was nice. With a bottle of wine the cost for two was $S290. Maybe the entry level menu did not showcase the gourmet offerings that might be available from the more expensive set menu options, but the food we were presented with sure wouldn't encourage us to want to venture back and pay even more money.The week before we had just enjoyed an entry level set menu experience at China Doll in Sydney for a similiar price and that meal was just fantastic. Every course was delicous
5
Came here to dine with my family on a super busy Saturday afternoon but was still served promptly with much professionalism and food was great. Had a good mix of Dim Sum and dishes from the main menu.The Dim Sum served was really of good quality and price is affordable too. Particularly love the Siew Mai, Spare Ribs in Black Bean Sauce and Scallop with Filo String. We also had steamed prawns and fish, that was superbly fresh and delicious. Would definitely come back here again for the food and quality service. Great for nice meals with the family in a comfortable ambiance and setting
5
Had a family dinner with excellent food and service by Terry Lim... All the food recommended was to our liking... Will visit again...
5
Having dinner with my family at peach blossom. With their manager Terry Lim servicing us and taking care of all our needs. Had a great dinner there, the good is great and ambience of the place is good
4
Went for Sunday dimsum brunch. Service wasn't fantastic (knowledgeable but no smiles) a little typical of Chinese restaurants but I expected more from 5 star hotel Best: roasted pork and duck n chicken , steamed dumpings. Fish Maw soup to die for (i had 3)Mediocre: pork trotters in vinegar. Excessively sweet n v disappointing Not 4 stars but 3.
4
Good food and service. But expensive and food portion a little small. Nice ambience for gathering with friends or family.
5
Attentive and friendly staff. Great quality of dim sum and other Chinese selection even pick from the a la carte Buffet dim sum. Price is reasonable, especially with the Maybank credit card promotion.

Spent 4 days at the wonderful Marina Mandarin Hotel . We chose Peach Blossom for our last night , anticipating a special evening . We were let down by timing and lack of ambiance. Our order consisted of 2 soups , 1 main , special fried rice & 2 glasses of wine. Our mains appeared on the table as we were eating soup. We were a bit perplexed by the timing of the service. Adding to the disappointment was a large table next to us with 2 toddlers who were allowed to noisily run around their table. Their baby was also crying. We are parents ourselves but wouldn't choose to bring children to such a restaurant after 8.30pm . While this was beyond the control of staff it showed a lack of thought and planning. The restaurant was divided into two sections . Why weren't couples seated elsewhere? Loved the view of Marina Bay sands but our $ 150 could have been better spent elsewhere.

Managed to find this restaurant from Tripadvisor after reading those favorable comments. Decided to try out with relatives to celebrate birthday & Mother's Day for dinner . It was indeed a good choice. Food was delicious & tasty but what really surprises us was the level of service extended by the staff to make our meal an unforgettable experience. They were exceptionally courteous & friendly plus went that extra mile with trimmings, complimentary birthday desserts & takeaway mother's day & birthday gifts. Special mention goes to the two ladies staff who served us by the name of Christine and Mun Fong plus their other colleagues Alvin, Terry, Bowie, Sook Teng, Hui Hoon, Sun Jing & Akira. I have been to many restaurants that serves good food but this is one of the very few restaurants that the staff really go all out to delight their customers. Will definitely come again. Hope they will maintain the high quality service

The restaurant give us a traditional environment for dining. The menu has large range of selections. Its good my friends and I had our birthday's dinner, food and service was excellent. Recommend one of the fish - Dong Bo Spare Ribs...Yummy

We stayed in the hotel and decided to go for dinner. We didn't expect much but was astonished at how delicious our dinner was. Peking duck and roasted pork were amazing. This restaurant serves better Cantonese cuisine better than others

We have our lunch and delighted by the smiles and attractiveness of the staff which is rare in Singapore.
Like to thanks these staff: Alden and his team Terryville, Vivian, Munich Finger , Sun Jing, Christine, Douglas and Akira. Kudos!!

Honorable mention to Terry, Nobel, Bowei, Mun Foong, Sun Jing, Jeff, Vivian, and Christine. They made the birthday celebration even better, livening up the atmosphere, even singing for us.

Great choice, introduced by the manager. It is really value for money. Was told the Chilli crab is good there, have not tried it. But will definitely find time to try. $300 to $350 for 5. Tim Sum and stir fried. Lobster, fish, prawn..... lots to hav

My wife and I had dinner when staying at the Marina Mandarin. It was delicious. So tasty and light, not like lots of Chinese meals we have eaten in the past. The staff are very elegant and the restaurant is very relaxing
5
At Peach Blossoms tonight. Good services, an enjoyable dining experience. Thanks to the talented Terry, the bubbly joyful Christine, and the other team members Alden, Nobel, Sook Teng, Mum Fang and Akira
5
We have double birthday celebrations for my dad and myself at Peach Blossom Restaurant.The staff, Terry, Soon Teng, Akira and Christine served our table with utmost sincerity and earnestness to let us feel welcome. We let off our guards and spoke freely with them as if I had been a regular customer. But this was my first time there and I want to go back again for more occasions. Other staff Alden and Mun Fong smiled to us even though they were serving other tables.Special mention and praises to Terry who wrote well wishes calligraphy on 2 plates for my dad and me. He crafted dough figurines of a pig and shou gong for me and dad respectively. I will show pics of his masterpieces. He took great pain to wish us in the most appropriate poems.Christine read out his poetic phrases and sang birthday songs.They left indelible impression in our birthday celebrations. Kudos to Terry n Christine on the extra mile of services and special thanks to Akira and Soon Teng for their dedicated services
5
We are really enjoyed our birthday dinner. The food and service were excellent. special thank you to all the staffs at Peach Blossoms. Mr Alden, Terry, Nobel, Sook Teng, Mun Fung, Christine and Akira. They have made a memories dinner for us.

Mum’s birthday dinner recently at Peach Blossom, Marina Mandarin was very pleasant one. The food was delicious and staff was very warm and friendly.They helped with the Peking duck so presentable with the side sauce. The rest of the duck meat cooked with dried chilies and cashew nuts – bot crispy and tasty! Other dishes includes vegetables with scallops and tang hoon was refreshing with a unique clean clear taste. The ostrich meat was tender and nice, and the Fried Rice recommended by our waiter was a “WOW” – DELICIOUS!We had dessert – glutinous rice with ice cream and avocado with ice cream served o dry ice flowing. So impressive! Both refreshing and delicious. Then come the longevity buns… it came with a big plate of beautiful wordings and read out cheerfully by their staff Christine. What a sweet gesture! The buns were so delicious that we ordered another 10 to take away!We enjoyed so much that we forgot to take photos of the food. We learnt that the figurines made from flour by one of your staff Terry after his working hours! So creative and Impressive! He said it takes about 7 days to solidify – a charming souvenir indeed!We would like to thank Terry, Jeff, Alden and Christine for making our mother’s birthday dinner so unexpectedly memorable. This place has simple hidden charm.. and we would love to come back may times again

I have dined in this restaurant 2 years ago and the quality is very good. This time when I went there for dim-sum again, found out their quality deteriorated a lot. All the dim-sum are pre-made and pre-steamed, after we placed order within 5 minutes all the dim-sum is served on our table. By the taste you can tell they have been sitting around in the kitchen for a while. With its price, I expect the quality to be higher with made-to-order dim sum. This restaurant is not very busy, I do not see a need to pre-steamed all dim-sum and serve in a speed of fast food restaurant. Will not recommend it.

Last night I and my siblings took my mum to marina mandarin peach blossoms to have dinner and celebrate her birthday.We order poach silver cob fish,coffee spare rib,seafood claypot and other dishes …my mum like all the food and the service is excellent,Christine is very cheerful and friendly,Alden the restaurant manager and Jeff thank you for the warm service.And Terry give my mum a wonderful and unforgettable birthday.a birthday poem written on a plate with the tart cake my brother brought . Overall ,it was a lovely dinner we had.

The Husband (he has been given an upgrade) and I brought his family there for his father's birthday celebration. Expectedly, the food was flavourful and did not fail us. But what really got our notice was their service (or should I say, relationship) to their diners.Frequent diners, I assumed, were called by their first names. One service staff even remembered a diner's birthday had just passed.That weekend saw many diners celebrating their loved ones' birthdays. We heard a birthday rap done by a service staff and wondered if it was only for that table.Nope! We got a birthday specialty too - a birthday poem penned by the manager, with a figurine to boot. Apparently, Peach Blossom's assistant manager goes the extra mile by making these flour figurines for diners on his day off from work.Overall, it was an engaging and lovely dinner. Thank you Terry, Nobel, Bowei, Sook Teng, Akira, Mun Fang and of course, Christine for the warm service. See you again on 9/4/17 (i am so sold on their service that im bringing my family there soon).This is so not a paid advertisement
5
Dear officer in charge, Please help me to thank them for their wonderful service. Mr Terry and his team service with their hearts and make sure our needs were taken care of promptly. They also proactively ask for feedback with regard to our dishes. Definitely indispensable assets to Peach BlossomsWe really feel at home eating. Regards, Eric Chi

Webt back to celebrate my dad's birthday. As usual my family came here because of the excellent service Terry gave to us. Dad was extremely happy with the food and the special cake arrangements. Thank you Terry for giving us a wonderful dining experience
5
Fully impressed with the tip Top service! Special thanks to the service team! Especially Mr Terry for taking the good time and effort on preparation of the nice chinese calligraphy and together with Bowei on presenting the longevity buns for my Mum's birthday! Both my mum and I definitely enjoyed our dining experience with Nobel, Alicia, Sun Jing, Akira and Christine, they have fantastic service and good vocal as their birthday song will leave us an unforgettable memory! We will be back!!

Me and my wife are very pleased with the excellent service rendered by the staff and chefs of Peach Blossoms which helped make our wedding banquet on 8 Jan 2017 a smooth and memorable one. Special thanks to Bowie, Alden and Vivian for their efforts in coordinating pre-wedding plans, including designing a sumptuous menu for our occasion, making it an unforgettable experience for all our guests. Always felt so much hospitality whenever we are back at the place for a meal. Strongly recommend this place if you are looking for fine-dining with a personal touch at a Chinese Restaurant. Have also added a list of highly recommended dishes you should try during your visit. =
5
The food is well display and nicely presented,I would like to thank the staff for giving the good service.
5
Very nice food with very courtesy staffs. They are Bowie and Alicia. Will back back more often. Member of life and style and entitled to 25% discount and can used given cash vouchers.
5
Peking duck was awesome and crispy and the crepes were placed on top of a steamer. Had a few other dishes, fried prawns in cheesy sauce, roast pork, fried oatmeal doufu, salted egg yolk soft shell crab, fried squid tentacles. Which were all very good.Do not miss these 2 other dishes, seafood horfun(half of which was stir fried but the other half deep fried - very delicious and unique) and stir fried scallops with celery and macadamia nuts which was bursting with wok-hei.Staff are very polite and attentive - will definitely visit agai
5
Every school holiday visited Singapore, definitely went back to Peach Blossoms for the dim sum buffet, the service staff informed the Maybank promotion is on going at $88 nett for 2 persons. Need to special mentioned the dishes, Cheese Lobster, Buddha jump over the wall......really enjoyed
5
Having lunch and settled for set lunch B at $62 per person with a minimum of 2 persons. Nice food and thanks Bowie and Alicia for serving us
5
Went down for a ala-carte dimsum lunch buffet. Atmosphere was relatively tranquil with a strong historical chinese vibe throughout the restaurant which complements well with the food. Service was super prompt and staffs are relatively friendly and nice!!!! Special thanks to staff Jeff, Sook Teng, Douglas and Noel for serving our table!! The staffs are well trained, relatively patient, prompt in serving; refilling and attending to our needs!! :-) restaurant is strongly recommended for family gatherings!
5
Booked the place for dim sum lunch under the Meritus card voucher - giving me 30% discount for food, a bottle of wine and a cake. To my dismay, I was informed the voucher cannot be used for the buffet dim sum. My pre-selected white wine, Sauvignon blanc, was also not available at the restaurant as they only serve Chardonnay. Both were not told to me when I booked the restaurant via the card concierge. Fortunately, Mr Alden Goh (Restaurant Manager), noticed our unhappiness and turned the situation around. He explained the terms of the voucher and although the restaurant does not carry Sauvignon blanc, he made arrangements for us to have it (instead of the Chardonnay). He also made sure that we are well-attended to throughout the lunch. Although, we still could not take up the buffet dim sum - took ala carte, the food was of good quality and the entire dining experience went really well. I must say that the service we received is exceptional, thanks to the exemplary service from Alden. Thank you
5
I have been here many times and always had very nice experience.The food is absolutely delicious and the service is excellent. The staff is super thoughtful and pleasant. Highly recommend
5
Wanted to bring my parents and elderly relatives for a good Chinese dinner and Peach Blossoms was undoubtedly my #1 choice. As usual, we left delighted after yet another highly satisfying meal that had everyone beaming from ear to ear.The ongoing Peking duck promotion was excellent value for money, especially when you take into account how succulent the duck was compared to many of its competitor's offerings. The other dishes were equally scrumptious and divine as well and spoke volumes about the restaurant's pride in their craft. The quality that distiguishes Peach Blossoms from the rest must be the superb service of its staff led by restaurant manager Alden. Alden's warm and personable style ensured that everyone had a comfortable evening of laughter paired with the thoughtful food recommendations he made.Thanks to his trusted suggestions, our entire dining party (both young and old) got to enjoy a delectable mix of dishes that catered to all our tastebuds.Another memorable evening! Thank you Alden and Peach Blossoms
5
Yesterday, my family and I had the pleasure to dine at Peach Blossoms for dinner with my grandparents. Although it was very crowded, the staff were extremely friendly and the service was fast. The dishes were succulent and main courses tantalizing. Coupled with the high quality desserts we ordered(fried durian), it is fair to say that we had the perfect ending to a scrumptious meal
5
We having a buffet lunch at peach blossom a few day back the food was very delicious and the staffs was friendly and helpful will bring more Friends to try the buffet lunch
5
Staff service at the restaurant is great. Very attentive and friendly. Special mention to staff Ms Vivian, Mun Fung, Faam Lee Lee and Alden. Always make my dining experience a joy there. Thanks , guys!
5
this restaurant is voted amongst the top 10 in asia
and has a pairing of tea with each course if preferred
the tea selection is top notch and the food is unrivalled
3
Plenty to choose from, what we did have was very nice. Service was very slow with staff opting to serve Asian customers and friends / family of the kitchen staff first. We ordered 12 spring rolls, a vegetable dish & 2 mains, we questioned if that would be enough for two and advised would be more than enough. We aren't big eaters and found we were still hungry when we left. Dishes were a lot smaller and more expensive than all the other restaurants we ate at this week. Had to ask twice for the bill which was strange as they didn't look busy with only 1/3 of tables occupied. Bit of a shame as had read good reviews about this place, the hotel was first class on the other hand.
3
We were the only non-Chinese in the restaurant when we went for dinner which was a good sign. It was far from crowded but we were greeted at the door as if we should have made reservations. The food was very good but not as good as I had hoped. I had the idea it was a family restaurant as there were many children.
5
Had a awesome birthday dinner at peach blossom yesterday.... Excellent service rendered by terry and team... Looking forward to my next visit!
5
Received excellent service from manager terry lim. Very knowledgeable abt his menu. Delicious dish recommended by him. Memorable experience. We will be back soon!! Good work terry lim.
5
First reputable restaurant where we got service from practically every staff who passes by. And it was from the manager to staff servicing other diners. The service started with the staff who settled us down and continuously came around to top up our tea cups and change our side plates to the manager who was passing by when we asked him to add some Tim Sum to our meal. Which he did immediately by writing them down and punching the order into the computer. We would have loved to order the a la carte Tim Sum buffet but it would had busted up too many diets. Just go and try it out. Better still stay in the hotel like we did many years ago, go back to the suite to drop everything after some shopping and wash up a little before going for a meal at the restaurant. Don't sign the bill to your hotel account as they always have credit card promotions on a la carte meals

Just had our wedding lunch banquet done at peach blossoms. We had countless of praises from our family and friends on the food served at our wedding. Love all the dishes, yummy!We were also very thankful for Vivian from peach blossoms. She is always very prompt in replying our email enquiries and she has also helped us a lot in coordinating our events. She has also recommended for us to change some of the dishes and we love her recommendations!Thanks Vivian and everyone at peach blossoms! All my guests were very satisfied with the food and venue :
5
Booked Peach blossoms for a team dinner and was very satisfied with the overall experience. The food esp the scallop crab meat fish roe and mushroom was delicious. The service by Terry, Noble, Sook Teng, Lee Lee, Christine and Mun Fung was good as well. We have a enjoyable celebration and dinner. Thanks to Terry also for the great plate art and poem which is also another key highlight. Will definitely visit again.
5
The staff is friendly and the meal is awesome. Dim sum buffet is quite good, we will go back for lunch again.
5
The meal was well prepared. Food was great. Service was great. Very nice personalized service with attentive staff.
5
We booked a table for reunion dinner on the Chinese New Year’s Eve. The dishes were delicious with very nice presentation. The services were simply impeccable. The waitress who served our table presented each dish properly, and she politely introduce to us the auspicious meanings of the Cantonese dishes. She also suggested us order a bottle of wine instead of by glass, as it would be more cost efficient. It was a pleasant evening. We are planning to go there again, although it is a little bit pricey
5
My family and I had a wonderful dinner and we are served so well by the friendly staff, Mr Terry, Ms Sook Teng, Ms Bowei and Ms Christine. I will definitely recommend to all my associates
5
We had dim sum buffet for lunch over there. The food is quite nice and The staff are very friendy. Highly recommand this restaurant for lunch and dinner
5
Had Chinese new year dinner at your restaurant on 9th Feb 2017 with my contractor, The food is fantastic and the service is excellent especially the staff name Terry Lim, he is really helpful and thoughtful. I had the lobsters, In order not to dirty my fingers so I decided not to eat the pincer but Terry help me to peel it. That really surprised me!! This is the first time i experienced in a restaurant that the staff do to the extra miles to peel the pincer for us. He even went around the 10 tables to help the rest of people who need help!! Really good service staff!!! Will visit again. Thank you Terry Lim
5
Had a lovely lunch with good service. The lohei was tasty. I liked the roast pork n roast duck as the meat was tender n cripsy. The salted egg salmon skin was also a nice treat. We tried the xiao long bao and it was juicy, the dumpling skin was not too thick. Overall the experience was really good. The food was fresh and not crowded for a Sunday lunch. Perhaps every was busy shopping since it was the last weekend before CNY.
5
I want to give special thanks to Terry, sook teng and chef Teck for presenting a memorable birthday celebration for my dearest sister. 2 thumbs up for the excellent service provided by them.
5
I celebrated my birthday and had a very memorable experience with my family. I want to specially thank Ms Sim Sook Teng, Mr Terry Lim and Chef Teck. My family love them so much and will always remember them!

Shared a business lunch for r. Out of the seven or so courses we shared, only one was really good. Service was not attentive--each of us took turns pouring tea. At end of meal, waiters moved in a table to set it up? Very uncouyh
5
Staff very kindly helped us choose the best dim sum menu. There was also an ala carte and set menus to choose from. Very happy with our choice.
2
Food:Roasted pork - the ratio of lean meat, fat, skin is totally wrong. Apparently over-cooked and very hard to chew.Roasted duck - way too dry, way too tough!Shrimp vermicelli roll - there is only 1 shrimp in each roll, which is very absurd. If you are running low on shrimps, then put it as out-of-stock.The only dishes that are okay are shrimp dumpling (har gaw) and egg custard bun.Service:Upon arriving, they couldn't find our reservation (we called like 3 hours ahead to make reservation yet they lost track). And the lady at front desk just pointed at a chair saying "you sit over there first" without any apology or politeness. We waited for 15min and no one came to us with any information, hence we had to ask again.The girl named Emma took our order and she is the only one that we find friendly and responsible. After confirming our order, she left the menu with us so we could add on if needed. 2min later, another lady came over (named something like soon teng) and grabbed the menu away. Then she asked whether we've ordered, so we told her that we want to keep the menu. She said okay and placed the menu randomly on another side of the table, blocking the position for serving dishes. The basic courtesy we expect is that she at least places it where she took it, but no
5
This was our 1st visit to Peach Blossoms and our experience matched many of reviews we read before make our reservation. Excellent staff/service and the menu/food was fantastic. All added to by the very kind thoughts and effort that went into the very personalised thoughts/birthday message & desert.A return to Peach Blossoms will certainly be on our must do list when we next return to Singapor
5
Back again for the dim sum buffet during the school holiday. The quality of food and service standard were still maintain high. We really enjoyed our meal there. Merry Christmas and Happy New Year 2017
5
The Dim Sum variety and quality are good, while service was excellent. Terry was careful not to let us over order and Mun Fong was very attentive to our needs. Fabulous experience

superb food and service.thanks to Terry , Nobel , Jeff and Christine!the fish was exceptional so was the vegetables. Waitress Christine was very hospitable and cheerful.
5
It was my first time visited this restaurant, delicious food and awesome service. The staff are friendly and the dim sum buffet is quite reasonable. Highly recommend this restaurant for dining

We had dinner at Peach Blossoms on a weekday evening. It wasn't busy. We got a table of three, a good view of the Marina Sands, but the table was a bit wobbly. It's a Chinese fine dinning restaurant with beautiful decor. All the dishes we had was very tasty and beautifully presented. The staff was very friendly and service was good
5
Went to this restaurant for my Mum's birthday lunch on 25th November 2016. The food was really really good and the price was reasonable. Restaurant Manager Alden Gan was in charge of our sector; he and his staff were very friendly and made the dining experience a pleasant one.We really enjoyed the lunch and will definitely return to this restaurant for more chinese cuisine
5
Nice meal,and had a great time in this restaurant. The food quality is nice, the service staff is excellent and friendly! Will recommend more friends visit here. We really enjoy the buffet lunch here. It's an unforgettable dining experience. I will definitely come here having meal again
5
The food is nice and good atmosphere the service is great the service staff are very friendly we all really enjoyed the dinner will recommend more friends to this restauran

they have a good food and good atmosphere there but the outstanding was the service which is very good, food was not so wow but overall good enough to recommen
5
12 people among them 2 TOP VIP's. Taylor-made menu. Best wasabi prawns ever, great service, Peking Duck lovely presentation and carved on the table-side. Wonderful ambience and overall a delightful experience. Business events in Singapore with authentic Cantonese cuisine, yet nothing too spicy or "exotic" for Western tastes. I highly recommend this restaurant. Finish the evening in their lobby bar downstairs and sip a cocktail under the largest atrium in the region.
5
Today is my wife birthday so we decided to celebrate at Peach Blossoms Chinese restaurant with my family. The food here is good and the service we received is awesome. The staff is very friendly. I got to know a few of them is Terry, Jeff, Mun Fang and Christine. Especially i need to mention is Christine, she gave my wife a unforgettable birthday experience by singing birthday song with us and prepare the cake on a plate with blessing wording on it. I will highly recommend this restaurant to everyone.
5
This restaurant has it all for Brunch; Decor, Service, and the FoodIf you wish to impress a first time visitor to Singapore, and transport them to what must have been like dining in the Imperial court of China. The decor has been tastefully designed to provide a hint of the Chinese court yard, without feeling like you're in Disneyland. The service is so discreet ,polite, and helpful in making suggestions. But it the food that takes center stage here. Its creative, visually stunning and most of all, delicious. Do not come if you are on a diet; you will only torture yourself. It is impossible to resist asking for seconds and third servings
4
Selected this Restruant to celebrate a special occasion and was not disappointed. We had one of the many selected menus and there was plenty of food and all enjoyable. Wine is expensive but again this is a high end venue. Location was extremely good and offered a variety of seating, big or small groups
5
Came to celebrate my dad birthday. Was served by the friendly team; terry , Nobel , Jeff and Christine. Had a memorable experience w special thanks to Terry for his calligraphy plate presentation.

One of the good Cantonese restaurants in Singapore with ‘prestige’ ambience and professional service. It has never scored below 7.5 in my personal scale of 1 to 10 but also never above 9. This meal proved no different.Unlike the last time, I was a guest and therefore did not choose the meal. I probably would not have chosen what my host chose given that there were only three of us. To start, she chose ginseng oolong tea. Crisp with only a slight after taste of the ginseng. The only problem is that it does not go well with all dishes and clashed with two dishes in particular. Stock to the Imperial Pu Er or have it at the end of the meal.We started with mushrooms in white truffle oil. I do not like truffle oil at the best of times (though I would make an exception for the lobster and glass noodles at the Imperial, Asia Square) and the oil did little to highlight the subtle ‘fifth’ flavor of the mushrooms. The crispy roast pork was very good. Dry to the touch, moist underneath with no fatty after taste. The jasmine tea smoked chicken clashed badly with our tea but the other two did not seem to mind. Maybe I am too fussy. Because of my decision to no longer eat things that are or could be endangered, she gave the shark fin and birds nest a miss. Instead we had the restaurants’ version of Monk Jumps over the Wall. It is notoriously difficult to get right but at this meal it was the standout dish. The steam fish, whilst good, was too much after the sensory and stomach overloading soup. The braised rice vermicelli with fish and bitter gourd again clashed with the tea. However, the coconut pudding with its three layers and unconventional pairings of different parts of the coconut left me again revising the meal upwards again. 8 out of 10 methinks

We booked this restaurant for tonight 12th November when we were in England based on the great reviews on here that also determined that we would stay at the hotel.We booked for 930 as we were arriving from Jakarta. Arriving at the restaurant we were kept waiting while they found a table. I'm guessing there must have been a worse one., but we were tucked in the corner next to the servers station - dirty plates and other dishes a glorious sight!!The food was okay but we were rushed - perhaps the proximity of 1030 and the closing time of the restaurant was to blame.The servers were not attentive and the ambience of which others have spoken was non existent. We could barely make ourselves heard over the clattering of plates and dishes as they tidied and prepared the tables for the next day.There was nothing special about the meal - equally as good food can found in other restaurants.A huge disappointmen
5
Good service there and would definitely recommend it to my friend. Staffs there were very friendly and nice,I would definitely like to go there again:)
5
We really love the ambience of the place and a few dishes that I would really recommend is the roasted pork, wasabi prawns and wagyu beef cubes with longan. The dishes were really tasty. Also it was my mum's actual birthday and manager Terry actually offered to provide her with 寿桃, what surprised us was how intricately the birthday dish was displayed with handmade flour decorative items and written with really meaningful chinese words. Thanks Christine for being so enthusiastic with us in taking the photos as well! We really had a wonderful dinner last night :
5
Made a reservation through Terry. Was there for my b.d lunch with family. We got ourself a nice seating next to the wine rack. The ambience was nice and comfy not too loud and was quite relaxing to be able to hear the birds chirping outside. The staffs were extremely helpful and observant to details. The foods tasted delicious and were well presented, my recommendation goes to the soya sauce chicken. Lastly, Terry prepared a nice gift together with the cake on a plate where he penned down his well wishes in mandarin. This is my 2nd time having my b.d celebrated over a meal with family there, peach blossom never fails to impress. Thank you.
5
the dishes were exquisite and of a high standard, which I usually do not expect from similar offerings. As food and dim sum are very good good and The hostesses thanks to ( TERRY and SHU QING as well as the rest of the team )They gave us excellent services through out the 3 times we have visited this place , no matter is normal dinning or celebrating birthday as a family , they gave us a memorable moment when we are in the restauran
5
Had a casual dinner with family. Great food (very fresh crab) and atmosphere. The service is impeccable. Special shoutout to Alden, Sook Teng, Bowie, Mun Fung and Christine for making every visit so special. would look forward to my next visit here again

I decided to bring my family to the dim sum buffet in Peach Blossoms, since it has been a number of years I last patronised the restaurant. The decor remains the same, and the service remains great. The dim sum buffet was quite different from the one three or four years ago. For one, they have a trolley that carries several popular dim sum dishes from which you can choose from. Secondly, they offer a select range of choice appetizers you can choose from (one choice per diner). So you get to try abalone, lobster, sharks' fin dishes in the buffet.Choices are abundant in this a la carte buffet. You can choose main courses, porridge, noodles, rice, djm sum, soup and even desserts. Since it's a buffet, you can order dishes any number of times. Portions are not small, nor are they huge. The food is also not too oiley. I didn't get the bloated feel after the meal.The buffet is available between 11:30 and 3 pm. It's a good deal, for a person at $58++. Children below 6 years old are free. Great to try if you will like to
5
My family celebrated my father's birhday at Peach Blossom. The service was great, the food was delicious! Special thanks to Terry Lim, Mun Fung and Bowi
5
Celebrated my wedding anniversary at Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin) last night and was pleasantly surprised with a small piece of cake and singing wishes by one of the staff. Is the thought that counts and the staff was attentive especially the Restaurant Manager Alden and his team namely Terry, Jeff, Alicia and Christine. A very pleasant and memorable experience
5
This place was recommended to me by friend and she said the dim sum was a must try, we left more than satisfied! The food was excellent and the service was top notch! I have to give credit where it's due, Jeff and Terry were our servers and they were excellent, very nice, polite and attentive.
5
Again good food, and one of the best service team I've ever encountered. We will be back every time visiting Singapore.

We made the right choice to celebrate my brother's birthday at Peach Blossom (Marina Mandaring)! Service was excellent and food was delicious. We enjoyed every dish especially the silver cod in rice wine. I must commend the attentive service extended by Terry, Jeff and Christine. We were pleasantly surprised when the birthday cake was brought out on a well decorated big plate with the birthday greetings for my brother beautifully handwritten in calligraphy on the plate itself. Thanks, Terry for doing this and Christine for the cheerful delivery of the birthday greetings in high spirits. The outstanding service has made this birthday celebration a memorable one for the family. We will definitely return for another happy occasion

This is a place where we still like to patronise after a couple of years because of its quality food like Peking duck and Claypot salted fish with doufu and chicken. Also, the staff are attentive, especially Terry and Mun Fong.

I organised a special dinner for my father's 79th birthday for 19 guests and planned this about a month in advance. Terry was wonderful and obliged with a private room at the back of the main restaurant. The private room had a really nice ambience and had views of the skyline of the financial centre and Marina Bay Sands. He also helped plan the menu, taking into account my father's special dietary requirements. The service was impeccable and he and Christine devoted themselves to our room, introducing each dish and course as it came and them serving individually, while at the same time ensuring that our drinks were always filled.The food was excellent. The soup was a clear double boiled consommé with free range chicken and was really flavourful. I particularly enjoyed the garlic roasted chicken and the korobuta pork chop was spectacular, with every delicious morsel melting in the mouth.After dessert there was a birthday cake placed on a large plate on which was inscribed a Chinese poem written personally by Terry, who also incidentally personally arranged the flowers on the plate. All in all it was a memorable dinner which my father hugely enjoyed. Many thanks to Terry and Christine and we will certainly return

I was here with a group of vinophiles on Wed doing a small wine tasting cum dinner. We were pleasantly surprise when Terry took the initiative to offer us brand new stemware when we just wanted a glass will do. Service was prompt and delivery of food was just right with our flight of wines. Although the restaurant was pretty packed that night, Sook Teng managed to handle our request well and always with a genuine smileI am here again tonight with another group of friends for a casual dinner and that high level of service with tasty fresh cuisine consistently delivered by Bowie.Well done and keep up the good work and smile

I had the pleasure of celebrating my mother's 68th birthday at Peach Blossom with my family and we had a fabulous evening to remember. As always, Peach Blossom delivered on its reputation as one of the finest Cantonese restaurants in Singapore. We ordered a set dinner for 5 and the food was scrumptious and servings plentiful. The icing on the cake was clearly the service level delivered by the restaurant staff. Terry and Nobel were warm, delightful and made us feel like royalty. Thank you for such a wonderful celebration

My family celebrated my mother's birthday earlier this month with a fine dinner at Peach Blossom. The excellent service and food made our day for the joyous occasion. Thank you

The restaurant is filled with authentically Chinese design and have an amazing view of Marina Bay Sands. The environment and ambiance is very cozy and homely too. Not to mention the staff as well, Christine, Sun Jing, Mun Fung and Terry very helpful and attentive towards the needs of guests despite of the restaurant being busy and full house during lunch hour. Keep up the good work!Credits to the chef, the food itself taste amazing especially the custard bun. I would say, what you pay is what you get.Recommend to try this restaurant

we had the unfortunate experience of having dinner here. we did not make a reservation on Saturday evening. when we walked in at 630pm, the staff got us a table rather quickly, although it did seem that they were not happy. nevertheless, we ordered our food, which arrived quickly. the menu is extensive and not too pricey. we ordered our soup of the day which was individually served and delicious. the and while we were enjoying the fried rice with scallops and the bbq meat trio, other guests arrived. the table next to ours became filled with people who did not think twice about talking so loudly. so while the food was great, the noise totally spoilt our dinner. we could not get out of the restaurant fast enough
4
we had a sumptuous seafood dinner to celebrate our clinic's anniversary at a quiet corner of the restaurant. Food was beautifully presented especially the lobster salad in dragonfruit and the pumpkin puree dessert. Terry, Alicia and Christine were friendly and made the celebration a memorable one
5
Thanks Terry and Sook Teng for the wonderful service! Really enjoyed the food and company! I will recommend my family and friends to visit this wonderful restaurant for awesome delicious delicacies
5
I ate here last year whilst staying at the Ritz Carlton, The food was beautifully cooked.Would definitely recommend this restaurant and I would also attend again in a heartbeat.very luxurious and great service
5
Greeted with a genuine smile and escorted to a nice quiet table. Drinks menu were offered immediately after cold towel were served. What a relief after such a hot and humid evening at the F1 race. The food is awesome complimented with Chef Kam coming to say hello after I gave feedback on the glass noodles which my guest enjoyed. A great delight and opportunity to see the service crew working so well with the kitchen staff. Excellent service rendered to my guest especially from Sook Teng, Alicia and Bowie. I will be back with more of my VIPs. Thanks for a fantastic evening

Had dinner in this restaurant before leaving Singapore the next day. It 's conviniently located in Marina Manderin Hotel but hard to assess because of the formula one race. The food was lovely, and the chef cooked excellent quality food that we all enjoyed. However, the service was on average only. A waitress accidentally breaked a teacup in our table while serving food, which reflected on the terrible handling of glassware and ruined the overall service and ambience of the restaurant. Otherwise, the service will have been nice. The price was expensive but Reasonable because of the high quality food served.
4
Celebrated my mum's 80th birthday. Food was good and service excellent especially Christine who attended to us. Thanks to Bowie and Terry who made the extra effort to ensure we had a memorable and enjoyable evening. My mum was very happy with the birthday longevity buns and the birthday greetings written nicely by Terry. They also sent a birthday song for my mom. Such caring and attentive service together with good food will definitely encourage us to return again. Keep up the good food and service

Dear friends, On the 11th September, my family celebrated our Parents' 40th Wedding Anniversary at Peach Blossoms in Marina Mandarin located on the 5th floor. We reserved 7 tables for family and friends to be held there for dinner. Our immediate family had lunch together there too. It was a very memorable meaningful time together and we had the best service there ever. We are regular patrons at Peach Blossoms over the years at Marina Mandarin and have come to be acquainted with the staff there as well. The staff are very pleasant, friendly, helpful, attentive and gracious. They are willing to go the extra mile for you and are willing to go the full nine yards. They are attentive to the details and are willing to assist in our preparations. They are very patient and remembers what we have told them in advance and carry it out later for us. They are motivated individuals who takes initiatives too. My family's event went very smoothly without a hitch and it's all 'Thanks & Credit to the staff - Assistant Restaurant Manager Nobel Chang and her team Bowie, Sun Jing and Hui Hoon(unsure if I spell it correctly the name)". They have been truly professional, hospitable, and helpful to us. My family are very thankful to them and grateful for their service. We will certainly be going there for meals and our guests thoroughly enjoyed their meals commending it as tasty, sumptuous and delicious. Peach Blossoms ought to take pride in their staff from Chefs to Service Staff. Thank you Peach Blossoms at Marina Mandarin for a blessed memorable experience. With Gratitude, Desmond De Silv

Have celebrated a few wedding anniversaries including our own and a few birthdays in Peach Blossoms, Marina Mandarin Hotel Singapore. Variety and quality of food is good. I have personally known one of the service team leaders, Terry Lim for many years and he has always been very attentive to his customers, knowing their likes and dislikes. We just had a dinner with another couple friends in Peach Blossoms a few days back to celebrate the birthday (of the wife) and their wedding anniversary. Though Terry was away selling mooncakes but his colleagues, Nobel, Christine and Alicia served us with equal attentiveness, and arranged a pleasant surprise for our friends. They had an enjoyable dining experience that evening.Thank you Nobel, Christine, Alicia and Terry. Keep up the good work! It takes a big heart and humility for one to be able to work in the F&B industry with passion despite the long hours and numerous challenges with difficult customers from time to time. I see these in you! :
5
Came here for my birthday dinner with my family. Probably one of the best service I have ever received in S'pore. Very personalized by the service staff, Christine, who was so bubbly and cheerful throughout the entire night. Also big thanks to the other staff members, Terry, Bowie and Nobel who i understood played a huge supporting role in the preparation of the dishes. Most importantly, the food was amazing, and i think the highlight for me had to be the wasabi prawns, ying yang hor fun and the beef cubes. I was even pleasantly surprised by the calligraphy written next to the cake and Christine even rapped it out for us! Will definitely come here again in the future. Highly recommend this place!
5
I strongly recommend this place because the food is delicious and especially Sook Teng attentive service. She serve us with passion and go beyond her duty
5
My family and i were absolutely delighted to be served by Ms Sook Teng who served us with so much patience, passion and joy.
5
Came here for a family dinner and thoroughly enjoyed the evening! Food was great; the wasabi prawns, the Ying yang hor fun, and the silver cod in Chinese wine were particularly good. Service was fantastic, particularly the attentiveness of our main service staff, Christine. We were also celebrating a birthday and were pleasantly surprised that the birthday cake was decked on a plate with a Chinese poem handwritten calligraphy style! There was even a cute little figurine made of sugar. Many thanks to Terry, Bowie and Nobel who were working hard behind the scenes to create the yummy dishes and the wonderful birthday surprise.Definitely coming back again. A very good dining experience, the food was very yummy, and the birthday boy was very happy - a thoroughly enjoyable evening made possible particularly because of the wonderful service of our service staff Christine! Highly recommended if you seek an enjoyable evening with good food and service that will not disappoint

Excellent service but very bland food and overpriced. The spring rolls tasted as if they were bought frozen from a supermarket. The Soy chicken was a very small serving and tasted like it was simply poached in water with no sauce, flavour or seasoning to speak of. The pork collar in xo sauce had no punch at all. We also requested tap water but was presented with 3 bottles of water over the course of the meal valued @ $10 each which was only realised when paying the bill. Very disappointing overall.
5
Knowledgeable and has an aptitude to engage her clients.
I have taken time to commend her because I myself appreciate good, professional service.
5
Had a lovely dim sum lunch with the family! Tried some of the creative dim sums by the master chef. Otah siew mai was a delightful pick! The black truffle mushroom bao was visually interesting and a fun creation by the chef. kids love it! The usual dim sum items were of fine quality and the dining experience was really pleasant! Very attentive and prompt service
5
I came here meeting my friends last week. To my surprise, the food and service the Peach Blossoms provided us are so great even through I have been told they are very good. I would like to come back again and recommend it to my friends. 非常棒的餐厅。我跟我的朋友们来用餐，优雅舒适的环境，可口的餐食和非常棒的服务，让我们的用餐非常愉快。我们决定以后经常来这里
4
My family was celebrating my birthday dinner on 210816 and it is our 2nd time having dinner at this place. I was very touched by the personal service rendered by Terry, Mum Fung and Christine. The birthday cake was placed on a big plate, decorated with mandarin greeting idiom and a handmade figurine done by Terry. I really appreciate these efforts by the team and will surely remember my 41 birthday dinner. Thank you
5
We requested Master Chef Francis CHong to arrange a menu for 6 of us. The dishes he arranged were fantastic, good portions, tasty, impressive presentation and most of all, all my grusts showed a "thumbs-up" for the whole meal. Master Chef Francis is indeed an expert in chinese cuisine, not only on taste, but also not forgetting the chinese cuisine traditional culture. Will definitely recommend more friends to go to Peach Blossom for delicious Chinese Cuisine by Master Chef Francis Chong
5
Our continued visits were always pleasant due a waitress named Nobel Chang. Most of our meals were recommended dishes and my family and myself will want to credit her for her notable effort in making good, knowledgeable recommendations that accommodate well the day of our moods.A pleasant waitress with a much know how, a big Thank You

Was looking forward for a nice birthday dinner. Made reservations specifying this is for a couple birthday dinner. Came to restaurant, they had no reservation but got a table as restaurant was empty. We got put in a bad spot with worn furniture from the last decade with no atmosphere whatsoever and floodlight lighting. Servers were extremely non-attentive and after waiting and finally checking what's going on they were all chatting in a corner. Food came out of the kitchen spread over 15 minutes. It was hard to just have a regular meal. Either just rice or just meat or just vegetables, nothing together. BAD. Just choose one of the many restaurants in the city
4
We had a small family dinner for my sister's birthday at Peach Blossom. It's a small cosy restaurant which serves generally good Chinese food esp yifu noodles and salted egg prawns. The waiters/waitresses were pretty attentive. The only issue was that the food came rather slowly when the restaurant was full.The staff who attended us wes very good, especially Nobel and Christine who even sang the birthday well wishes for my sister
5
When my friend told me that this restaurant has tied up with UOB to offer ala carte buffet lunch for 2 persons at a nett price of $95. Of course,I cant miss the opportunity to revisit the restaurant again with my friend and at the same time to celebrate her birthday.We ordered quite a fair bit from the menu and what I loved most was the prawn dumplings, roasted pork belly, honey char siew and tou miao. This offer came with a specialty menu where every customer is entitled to order one item from it. I ordered the "wagyu beef in a cone" and it was lovely.I not sure when this offer will end, but i do hope that i can visit it again before it expired
5
Had lunch with my families. The foods were nice and severed hot. Good portion served on each dish. Will recommend to friends
5
We were there yesterday to celebrate my parents' 60th wedding anniversary. Love the ambience and the food was delicious, we enjoy all food from our menu. The service staff Ms Christine, is friendly and helpful. Her manager, Mr Lim, specially prepared poem for my parents and read out by Ms Christine, we were really impressed
5
We went there with two good friends and were assigned a table deep inside the restaurant, an area very quiet and private. We tried the Peking Duck in 2 styles, and some other dishes. The foods were in excellent quality. Highly recommended to friends who go to Singapore who either on business or vacation purposes.
5
The food was nice and delicious. very personal service by Terry and Christine. Thanks for everything. I will recommend my friends to peach blossoms.
5
We had a session here! Nice environment here! The service was great, the food was delicious! Special thanks to NOBEL, BOWIE, ALICIA and MUN FUNG for the service~
5
Come to Peach Blossoms again on last few day and receive very great warm greeting from the waiter and waitress, especially Hui hoon and mun fung, their AM (Nobel) recommend us some new dish and that are so delicious.The manager Alden are so nice and helpful, their service are getting more excellent then before, same as the food :-
5
Great place to have dinner. We had a 10 course dinner. All the dishes are prepared with fresh ingredients. Personally, I like the peach blossom 5 combination platter, double boiled squad with fish maw and morel mushroom, chilli crabs (Chef Chong speciality), black pepper crabs, steam giant marble goby and the desserts which include chilled coconut jelly with mango puree served with coconut ice-cream and chocolate truffle cake. Will definitely visit again
5
I will recommend Peking duck and chili crab and will bring friends and family there regularly. Price is also reasonable
5
Dined at the restaurant through friend's recommendation. I was impressed with the choices of dishes, especially the Baked lobster and char xiu meat. Service was friendly even the restaurant was busy. Would definitely go back there for lunch because is value for money
5
Excellent food,menu prepared by Terry . Christine the waitress,is very caring and attentive. She is also our photographer.All staff on duty very attentive.
5
Over the weekend I had once again visited Peach Blossoms for Fathers' Day. It has been an unforgettable experience for me and my family. It wasn't the first time I am having dinner at Peach Blossoms. Besides my favourite dishes, the Wagyu Beef and Brinjal from the menu that never disappoints, I am so delighted to know that the staffs are really attentive and fast in the response. I remember vividly one of the ladies by the name of Nobel. She was really fast and responsive whenever we made requests from warm water, refill of hot tea and even remember minute details such as our preference in the menu and our special requests of chilli padi when we are done with our order. Her initiative in remembering small details warm our hearts. Definitely spending more occasions there
5
This is my second family leisure trip to Singapore with the purpose for my anniversary celebration. The foods is so delicious. Highly recommended.
5
I have been patronising this restaurant for more than 5 years. Every visit is never a disappointment. There is no need for me to read the menu when ordering as the Assistant Manager Bowie would arrange each time. Her food recommendation and services are fabulous.
5
The ambience was great. The food was delicious. The service from terry was marvellous👍👍👍👍👍. He is good in giving suggestions on the menu. Can't wait to visit again. Good job terry.
5
The ambiance is perfect and the service is impeccable. The service staff is friendly snd helpful. I always feel very comfortable and relaxed when I have dinner here.
5
Dining in the restaurant with friends. It was a good lunch. The service provided by Terry Lim was excellent. He is very attentive and friendly. We are very impress of his service and appreciated.
5
We had an early Father's Day celebration over dinner and thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of the meal - the food was exquisite, the ambience was elegant and comfortable, and the personalized service from Mr Alden and other attentive staff made us feel very well taken care of. We had a voucher which allowed us to claim a complimentary bottle of wine and a cake, which was beautifully presented on a large plate with calligraphic writings relating to fathers. Loved the nice touch this lent to the occasion! We will definitely return again for future meals and celebrations :
5
My family had the pleasure of dining at Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin) earlier today to celebrate the 70th birthday of my father jointly with Father's Day.In short, the whole experience was AWESOME!We opted for the Dim Sum Lunch Buffet and despite the fact that the restaurant was full and busy (probably due to happy regulars), the food quality was superb and service top-notch.The folks at Peach Blossoms delivered a knockout performance. Every dish we ordered hit the right spot and was met with unanimous approval from our entire table of 10 diners. The dim sum were delectable and main courses succulent. All dishes were presented in a mouth-watering fashion that certainly helped to whet our appetites. Coupled with the high quality of desserts offered (we ordered the entire range to share), it is fair to say that we had the perfect ending to a scrumptious meal. The happy smile on the face of the birthday boy (my dad) meant a lot to us and we are so pleased to have chosen to celebrate this important occasion at Peach Blossoms.Kudos to Lu Ping, Alden and Vivian who attended to all of our needs in an impeccable, intuitive and warm manner throughout our entire lunch. We look forward to many more celebrations at your restaurant in the future
5
The ambiance is nice. The food is delicious and also the staff Terry Lim is helpful and thoughtful through out the dinner. My family enjoyed and felt comfortable having dinner here.
5
Excellent and consistent food through the years. Very personal service by Terry and Nobel. I highly recommend the cod fish in chinese wine sauce.
5
We had organized a birthday dinner at the restaurant for our family. Chef Chong created a wonderful delectable menu of exquisite local and Cantonese cuisine. Service by the staff was impeccable, great attention to detail and even had artistic chinese calligraphy on the birthday plate with meaningful creative phrases by their staff Terry Lim. We had a wonderful evening and would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone. Thanks to Chef Chong, Alden, Terry and Sun Jing for making such a memorable experience for us
5
Fantastic service, special thanks to min fung (if I no mistaken) 😉 she provide professional to us. Food was delicious. Environment was nice.
5
Good dim sum buffet with Maybank promotion, 2pax just paying $100 nett. I will bring more friends over here to try. Thanks the service staff for the good service rendered and their friendly service
5
First time dine in the restaurant, it was a good lunch. The service provided by Terry Lim was excellent,he very attentive and friendly.We very much appreciated
4
We ordered from the ala carte menu and we felt that it was more valued for money than the set menu. We had cod fish for many of the dishes and I must say, the food was fresh and definitely tasty. The only pity thing is that the portion is too small, even the large portion was too small for a table of 11 + 1 child. Food was also served very slowly. Although it allowed us to have ample time to sample the dishes, the serving pace could be faster. Would not mind going back for another meal to try out some dishes which I did not have a chance to order
5
It's my second year to choose Peach Blossoms for the Mother's Day lunch and I am still discovering the great flavours from the dishes served at the restaurant!I took the Ala-Carte dim-sum menu (for lunch only) and even though it was only a selection of 19 items, all of them were not disappointing at all. I recommend the Xiao Long Bao, Steamed Chicken with Wolfberries and Chinese Wine, and Poached Shrimp Dumpling in "Szechuan" Spicy Sauce.For those who had experiences with szechuan dumplings with red hot chili oil, the dumplings that I mentioned above aren't those that you expected. This is filled with an incredible mix of tantalizing tastes. MUST TRY!Not only the dim-sum, the tea selection was great and I heard before that some of the tea were personally brought over from China! A great effort for the smallest item on the menu.Will definitely visit Peach Blossoms again
5
Mum wanted to be back here to celebrate Mother's Day. Food was good and service was fantastic. Mum loved how Terry Lim served us. She was also very happy with the home made figurine that Terry made to give her for Mother's Day. Thank you so much for making my mum happy!
5
Thanks to Terry Lim (Assistant Manager) & his team of service staff ( Nobel, Mun Fung, Hui Hoon, Sook Teng & Sun Jing) for excellent service whenever we dine in this restaurant. Food is always fantastic... Will be back again soon..

Extremely happy that I've made the decision to enjoy my dinner at peach blossom today! Not only did I get to enjoy many mouth watering food but also got to experience the outstanding service by the assistant manager Terry Lim. Terry is an extremely humble and helpful person that will go an extra mile for the customers, for example he will take his time to slowly explain the different type of dishes in order for us to make the best decision to our liking, he also gives great recommendation to what he feel is best. Will definitely recommend this restaurant as well as the service of Terry.
5
We had sumptous dinner @ Peach Blossom. The food was delicious and most importantly we are being delicately served by Sook Teng. She remembers all our favorite dishes and have them prepared according to our preference and taste. She would advise us on the selection base on our preference. Even though the restaurant is packed on weekend, she serves us equally well like any other days. We would love to visit again soon
4
A family dinner to celebrate a birthday, and the food was exceptional + service was commendable. The highlight of the dinner was the longevity bun platter with its exquisite dough(?) God Of Longevity, and a well crafted Chinese Poem for the birthday girl. Kudos to the restaurant manager (Aidan?) and his team for a wonderful dinner
5
Come to have dinner at this restaurant last week which recommended by friends. My friend and I just have some conservation and I think the waiter heard our chit chat about my friend's B'day and got surprise which we din't expected.

I wrote about them 2 years back about the excellent situation management, recently I was back there again after 15 months break or so, but the most surprising thing was that when I led to my table, one long serving staff--Noble, immediately call out my name, very impressed and still remember a customer have not patronage for the last 15 months or so.The same kind of warmth and friendliness continue to flow, as there are few other staffs also happy to see us back.I did not asked if they have a new chef, but the food served continue to be good and enjoyable...actually I enjoy more the friendship and recognition each time I visit Peach Blossoms, at the end of my meal, I was given a fruit platter complimentary, so nice and thoughtful of them to extend such a welcome to me.Will be back here for many more years

He also good at recommend dishes to us. Will definitely reccommend friend and family to this restaurant

My mum & I just had the dim-sum buffet lunch at Peach Blossoms.The front-line service was praiseworthy. Reservation was smooth. Reception was warm. The waitress (Alicia) was attentive & thoughtful. It is thus regrettable the kitchen's standard detracted the service quality from the front-line team.Right from the start, the speed of food readiness was not exactly expeditious. Especially for a non-crowded restaurant. It was tolerable ... until the last order of main dish was made. It was a simple order of just 1 small portion of noodles. After 10 minutes, Alicia took the initiative to hasten the food. After 20 minutes, I asked for the bill. After the bill was signed, then the 1 portion of ordinary noodles finally appeared. By then, it was more than 23 minutes since the order was made.Perhaps the kitchen team mistook the concept of dim-sum buffet to be that of Slow Food Movement. The original intention was to assess if the place's a potential venue for a birthday celebration at month-end. The kitchen team has made the decision for us
5
Was served by Alden and his team. Their service is impeccable. The food itself was delicious and we savoured every bite! Thank you Peach Blossoms for a wonderful dinner!
5
The food is superb at Peace Blossoms! I like the Peking duck served in wraps, and the remaining meat served with lettuce and noodles. All the staff are friendly and professional. Special thanks to Terry Lim and Ryan for their excellent customer service and good recommendations. Will visit again!
5
We contacted Mr. Terry of Peach Blossoms a week before setting up a lunch with family to celebrate our dad's birthday. He planned the menu and arranged a very nice room to accommodate 23 of us. Everything was PERFECT! Food was fabulous, great service and fantastic ambience!Mr. Terry even asked his fellow colleagues to greet my dad before we left the restaurant.

Food is good though portions are extremely small. Especially of good value is their set dinner. The waitresses are extremely cheerful and friendly. Same could not be said about the lady are taking our orders. She are grumpy and unhappy and seems intent to let it be known to us

I hosted 2 Chinese New Year family gatherings last week at Peach Blossoms. The staff at the restaurant took the extra mile to make sure we all enjoyed the events. As usual, the food was excellent. Our requirement for vegetarian menu on the 1st day of the Chinese New Year lunch was met more than what we expected. I would also like, in particular, to commend Terry, Vivian, Bowie, Nobel, Jeff, Mun Fung and Sook Teng for the service quality extended to us for not just the recent events but for the overall experience we have enjoyed over the past few years at Peach Blossoms

THE GOOD:great dim sumgreat food overallgreat serviceTHE NOT SO GOOD:Not much, perhaps if being fussy. Having Cheung fun on the menu.Having googled for best dim sum restaurants to go to, this was close to our hotel and ticked a few boxes. The service was brilliant and the food was very good. There are so much to choose from and the food is just delicious. I really can not wait for another trip to Singapore as this will be top of my list to come and eat at.What is brilliant about the menu is that you get freshly cooked food in small portions so you can savour even more dishes. The price for lunch is brilliant, you will be challenged to find a better value for money restaurant in Singapore.Some of our favourites to try is the Xiao Long Bao, the crispy fried squid balls and the salmon skins

Last Saturday I had my first dinner together with my friend at Peach Blossoms to celebrate my Birthday, I must say the service of the staffs, made my birthday celebration all the more memorable. First when we ordered our foods, the staff - Vivian had suggested to take out one dish cause she said we had ordered too much, true enough the food we order was just nice. To cap off a wonderful dinner, they served me a birthday cake on a plate calligraphed with a chinese poem honoring my birthday and also singing birthday song to me, on top of that there was one figurines of the 'monkey' carved out of dough which were crafted by Terry (Peach Blossoms AM)personally. Really love the calligraphy & 'Monkey' very much. On the whole, this is a good fine dining restaurant where the service and the food are worth paying for. I like to thank Terry, Bowie, Aiden, Vivian, Sharon & Iris

Celebrate my friend's birthday at here with the birthday poem prepared by Terry making us so surprise, the peom are so winderful and also receive the cute flour figuring from Terry. For sure will come back again next time with all my friends and family.

About a week ago when we were visiting from Sydney, we were brought by a dear friend to this restaurant for dinner. I must say the service of the staff and especially the manager, Terry made our visit all the more memorable. Knowing that we were invited guest from overseas, he paid special attention and was particularly helpful in recommending the dishes of that night. To cap off a wonderful dinner, the dessert was served on a plate calligraphed with a chinese poem honoring our visit and there were two figurines of the 'monkey and goldfish' carved out of dough which were crafted by him personally. On the whole, this is a good fine dining restaurant where the service and the food are worth paying for. 
5
The dim sum buffet was very nice and the pricing is very affordable for a 5-star hotel. More than 70 varieties of items to select. The staffs are friendly.
5
I saw the recommendation for the Dim sum buffet through this website and have tried it.I came with my friends to celebrate a birthday bash. We were served with a plate of birthday wishes in the form of chinese poem. The food quality is good and value for money.Their sevice staff is very friendly and attentive to us. The birthday wishes are also well written. I understand the poem was by their service staff, Terry. This venue is worth a second visit
5
We had lunch buffet and weren't particularly impressed by the menu initially. But we were pleasantly surprised by the food quality! It was a full house yet the service was immaculate. Service manager Mr Terry deserved special mention for his prompt and detailed attention to our needs despite a relatively overwhelming crowd turnout that afternoon. He remembered every fine detail that my friends would request of him. It was definitely money well spent at Peach Blossoms. Looking forward to their new menu!

I saw this restaurant on a list of the top 10 Dim Sum restaurants, and was excited to try... in short very disappointing. It could have been a really bad day for the restaurant, and maybe a one off, but I felt that the review needed to go forward in the hope that there is some way the management can learn from it.We were the first in the restaurant on this Sunday morning, and we quickly settled in to ordering from the a la carte buffet. The most basic items they had on hand on the tray they brought to our table, but when we ordered off the menu, this is where all the problems began. We actually waited 90 minutes for our orders to come out, and with three small kids, this was not an ideal situation. At this point, other tables which came to the restaurant almost an hour after our arrival, started receiving food that we had ordered, and yet... still nothing for us.At this point I asked one of the staff where our orders had gone, and the staff just said they would check on it. Still no answer or anyone came back, so I called for the manager. Finally when the manager made time for us, he told us that the computer system had got jammed up and the orders weren't coming through. It would appear that they didn't think telling anyone they screwed up was in order. Shame they couldn't use something more advanced, like a piece of paper and a pen.So... finally after multiple complaints, the food started to arrive. One order which was mean to be Lobster in a Cheese Sauce, turned out to be lobster in a basic canned nacho cheese, this felt like it completely ruined that lobster. Then when we got the beef, it was way undercooked, and all gristle.Finally the biggest insult was that we had a friend who avoided pork due to her faith, and because if this I ordered roast duck, and then for my kids roast pork, which I made as two separate orders. They then decided that because they were way over time, they put the two items together on the same plate. When they brought it our, I explained that there was a reason why I separated the two orders. The waiter's suggestion was then to put the existing dish on two separate plates... I almost fell off my chair.I really wanted to love this place, I was excited, and my wife can tell you how much I wanted to come... but really.... very very very bad experience

lou hei yu sheng invited by peach blossoms marina mandarin are very surprise which i never seen before in my life for the monkey head mega yu sheng, the food for tonight are very delicious, th service are also very bravo espeacially Terry, Nobel, Bowie and Ryan, they serve us very nice are care

We were there 2 days ago. Good food. Delightful ambiance. Very high standard of service displayed by staff. Managers Alden and Terry were there to make sure that everything was running smoothly. We were very impressed and enjoyed our meal there

Dined here with a few friends and the service is very warm and hospitable. They allowed me to use my Mandarin Lifestyle voucher which granted me 35% off and a free bottle of wine, plus a 500g cake. However, the cake needed 3 days advance notice (which the voucher didn't mention) and I will have to collect swing by again to collect the cake in future. On first glance, the menu is quite expensive and their premium selection of teas also feels a bit too expensive, but the great friendly service really makes up for it. the staff were very attentive and were prompt in changing new plates, topping up our tea and water and were helpful in suggesting dishes and recommendations. The trio of meats were really nice (char siew, soya chicken and roast duck) and we also ordered half a peking duck which they used the meat for a fried mee sua. The crispy roast pork was also very well done and paired with the mustard sauce, was very delicious. For the negatives, in one of our dishes, home made tofu with seafood, one scallop was completely off and the waitress gladly gave us a replacement dish of prawn with wasabi mayo. That was good customer service and generous of them. In this day and age, I also expected sharks' fin to no longer be on any menu, but they still had it on as a premium item. I hope they will end this unethical dish and stop serving it in the near future. Overall, after using our voucher, dinner came up to be $35 per person and we were really full and happy with the food and service. Hence, without the voucher it would have been $50 per person and that's still a very reasonable price for fine dining chinese restaurant. We'll definitely come back

Whenever we have a meal at Peach Blossoms, whether just 2 persons or a dinner event, the staff, Nobel, Bowie, Vivian, Jeff, Terry, Sook Teng are always patient with our requirements and changes, trying to accommodate our requests. They really put in a effort to ensure all is smooth during the dinner event.The food standard is still good, receiving good comments from friends with whom we had dinner with. Our son had soup and he said that it tasted like home cooked
3
This is average when compared to a Hong Kong dim sum restaurant. You might find the comparison unreasonable since this is Singapore but there are many good dim sum venues in Singapore. We had prawn rice rolls and also pork rice rolls which were good but came in a strange soy that I've never had before and I've eaten a lot of rice rolls - trust me. The won ton noodle soup is good however for a won ton. We also had dumplings in spicy sauce which tasted average at best. The service is good, however when we were there the place was practically empty so it was to be expected. The restaurant itself is fairly standard looking so not sure it would be ideal for celebrations but it is fine for dim sum if you are in that area. Would I go again?? Probably not.. Would I recommend.. Yes if in the area and had to eat dim sum or was staying in the hotel and didn't fancy taking a walk outside
5
Nice restaurant with good service and outstanding food. We booked a table for twelve and were pleased with the ambience, recommended dinner items from the waiter and relative value. We all shared thanks to the lazy susan a terrific dinner: - Cream of corn and crab soup x 4 - Pumpkin soup in a nice squash bowl x 2 - Hot and sour soup x 2 (spicy and flavorful) - Red grouper steamed in light soy sauce x 2 - Seafood fried rice - Fried noodles with seafood - Vegetables with garlic, ginger and scallops - Whole crispy roast chicken - Wagyu beef cubes with vegetables (and lychees ... a bit surprising there but good) - Shrimp with wasabi sauce (delicious)Again, everything tasted great and was presented well
5
Had this place booked for a while for Christmas Day dinner which was part of a big birthday trip to Singapore ,warmly welcomed and greeted by name at the door without even disclosing who we were! The resturant interior is beautiful , calm with very efficient service. We opted for some safe Cantonese food with the stand out dishes being the Peking duck and Kurobuta pork which were divine. The bill was reasonable for the quality and presentation of dishes and my friends at work even sent me over a bottle of bubbly from the UK which the staff set up , a nice surprise and it made the day even more special . If you are around the Marina Bay Area well worth a visit ,The set meals also look interesting and varied

Visited this restaurant and had dinner celebration for my sis in law. The food is refined and atmosphere was very good! The Service manager Terry was also very helpful and gave good advise on which food was suitable for old people and youngsters! Will definitely go there to eat again real soon!
5
I was amazed by the attentive service provided by Terry Lim and Alden throughout the dinner. The service provided by the service crews was excellent and the food were delicious and that were the main reasons why my father in law insist to be back there to have his birthday dinner. Terry was friendly and approachable. His small gesture of making the elephant flour figurine for my little gal just make her so happy. Overall experience was excellent. Keep up the good work.
5
Celebrated my birthday here with my friends and I must say the service here is really good, all are very attentive and friendly. Terry gave me a hand-made gift which is so cute and really appreciate him for the gesture. On top of that, he also took the initiative and prepared my favourite salted egg yolk custard bun as one of the desserts. Overall, I really enjoy my dinner here and I would definitely be back again. Once again, thanks for the wonderful evening. :

My fiance and I were looking for ROM dinner location and decided to check out Peach blossom as he recalled having good Chinese food there. We called the restaurant and was served by a lady called Vivian. We were lucky as there was still private rooms available on our ROM date so Vivian further engaged us through email. She was really patient and nice as we had myriad questions but she would address them one by one in the email.Needless to say we had a smooth rom dinner with our immediate family and we are pleased with their staff's excellent service, in particular Sook Teng who served us throughout the dinner. Will recommend this restaurant to other couples too :

went there for a family dinner . Atmosphere was pleasant and service staff were attentive , friendly and very helpful . The food is good and too certain dishes are worth mentioning - like especially their cod fish slices in chinese wine, beef cubes with lychee , beancurd with seafood in claypot . You can even choose the menu items on line and so makes planning for a bigger party easier and less stressful ; they will also offer suggestions through the same medium . Prices are reasonable and if you have their Lifestyle membership card , you can obtain further discounts. would certainly return if i want a dinner for special occasion
5
This is my third time coming to Peach Blossoms, which I get to stay with my friend, Andrew in the Marina Mandarin hotel. The food is delicious and they serve us with just a quick click. The staff which is Terry, Amy and Nobel was friendly and the service was the best I ever had. I will come often to have my breakfast, lunch and dinner over at Peach Blossoms again. If you ever to to this place, do look for them
5
Hosting a birthday party at this restaurant was marked by high anticipation of a rewarding evening. I was not disappointed by either the food or the service. Food quality was high and the service was attentive. Ingredients used were fresh and the cooking was to perfection, whether it was the roasted suckling pig or the winter melon soup or the steamed whole fish. Each dish was served piping hot with no lag time that results in soggy yuck. Guests enjoyed every morsel and felt deep satisfaction with the well prepared food that made the evening memorable
5
1st time eating at Peach Blossoms, recommended by friends. I love the roasted pork, scallop, egg custard steam bun, fried carrot cake & egg tarts. I was impressed by the Chinese wordings written on the plate. It was written by one of the restaurant staff & the creative hand made figuring.
5
Peach Blossem has been my favourite Chinese restaurant for a number of years. The ambience is uniquely oriental and the tables are quite spaciously arranged.The chef table in the private room is most distinct and almost without fail every such dinning experience receive top marks from my business associates.When come to service, the team always attain a level of excellence. In particular Bowie gives good recommendation for food variety. She is always attentive and responsive. Mun Fung can remember my favourite tea for every of my visit.Overall the restaurant gives me a warm and homely feel.
5
I love the ambience here @ Peach Blossoms. I frequently dine here, not because only of the food, but because of the great rapport I have with the assistant manager, Terry. His service is so good, recommending us food, and also the effort he puts in the flour figurine is impressive. his hard work is commendable. If there is any celebrations/ events/ or the need to host a dinner for clients, just give Terry a call & he will settle everything smoothly for us, he never fails to impress me.
5
I dine here frequently with my family & friends, @ Peach Blossom. The staff & service here's very good, and we always look for the assistant manager, Terry and the service staff Mun Fung. Terry is a very friendly and approachable person, and never fails to attend to us. Mun Fung is a very friendly lady too. I am also very impressed with the flour figurine that Terry makes. I am never once disappointed by the service here. & the food here is up to standard

Peach Blossoms has always been one of my favorite Chinese restaurant. Not only the foods are awesome, the services are great too, especially staffs like Nobel Chang, Sook Teng and Hui Hoon.

A very good place to have buffet dim sum at Singapore, the price are just reasonable where there is including not just dim sum but also soup, main course and dessert. You can't imagine with the price of 38++ sing dollar can have so many type of dish including mini Buddha jump.The staff are well train and they provide their best service to us, they change our dirty plate without our calling, introduce each of their dish to us by patiently In the end, I strongly recommend this Chinese restaurant to all people who looking for a great buffet dim su

We had a splendid dinner on the eve of Deepavali. The food was great especially the Peking duck and I simply love their soup. Service was excellent and nice ambience too. I would love to bring my family again for my FIL's birthday in December too. Thumbs up everything!!
5
I am a regular diner. One of my favourite dishes is the Peking duck, superior to that in several other Chinese restaurants that serve the dish. One reason why I keep coming back to the restaurant is the excellent service of the staff. They are professional and attentive. I specially commend manager Terry Lim. He knows our tastes and we always take his recommendations when there are new dishes. My aunt was very impressed when he presented her with a handmade å¯¿ figurine when we were there for her birthday celebration.
5
Friends brought me to peach blossom for dinner and I must say the Chinese cuisine here is excellent! Great service by staffs, especially Terry Lim the assistant manager, who ensured that we had a great time dining on top of helping and giving me tips on how the hairy crab is to be consumed. Waitress Mun Fung who ensured our glasses are always filled and food was up to our expectations was another role model on how customers should be served. I will definitely recommend this place to everyone I know and will visit once more for its great food and hospitality
5
Great food and great service. The set dinner is great when you are alone or only two of you. Sweet and sour pork is splendid, must try. Very friend waitresses. Recently we have the set dinner with hairy crab. The crab meat fried with eggs melt in my mouth
5
Nice, clean, quite, comfortable room, good food special Peach Blossoms, The assistant manger Terry Lim is very friendly, provide excellent service, so are the rest of the staff. A la cartel buffet at Peach Blossoms is value for money.....

This evening I had dinner with my family at Peach Blossoms, Marina Mandarin. The Manager, Mr Terry Lim, was friendly and enthusiastic. He recommended us dishes that were delicious and balanced after finding out our likes and dislikes. The service staff were equally pleasant and attentive especially Ms Nobel. All these made our dining experience tonight a pleasant and memorable one
5
Have been to Peach Blossoms several times with my family members and my mother simply loves the food. (Note: My mother is quite picky with what she eats).Personally I loved the pumpkin soup (served in small golden pumpkin), wasabi prawn, cod fish and many others more... On top of that, the seasonal specials is also highly recommended.Lastly, thumbs up on the services. The waiters and waitresses give you ample room for privacy chats with friends but are ever ready to spring into action whenever we need something.... This is the place that I will be visiting very often
5
I do come to Peach Blossoms last month and having the dinner here and the food was so tasty and delicious, the service staff are so warm and nice to serve us especially when I ask for drink from their manager, she explain it very well to me. a very good place to have your meal. Totally recommen

Ala carte dish was good. However the dim sum was a great disappointment. Har kow and siew mai taste like those from supermarket straight to the table

Been to peach blossom for many times but hasn't written any review so decided to give a review for my dinner experience...The restaurant is bright, clean and cosy. Specially crowded during weekend nights where many families will come for dinner. As the meritus lifestyle member, you do get great discount for dining.Ordered the shark fin soup with crabmeat, crispy chicken, fried bean curd with oatmeal, wasabi prawn and waygu beef. The serving was fast and the staff are very professional. Food was delicious too!Great restaurant for family or friends gathering! Not forgetting the restaurant also serve authentic Tim Sum during lunch!Dr E Cho

For full review and photos, please visit: http://summerlovestoeat.blogspot.sg/2015/08/ala-carte-dim-sum-buffet-at-peach.htmlThe service here was not so good. No one attended to us to take our drinks order after we were seated for around 5-10 mins - We have to call for them. There were quite a few times we couldn't find any staff nearby us to place our food order whereby the restaurant was only half-filled. As this restaurant has 3 sections, they should assign 1 or 2 staff at each section to standby since this is a 5 star hotel. Most of the staff were not with any smile too except one of them was good.I would like to highly recommend their Steamed Honey Glazed Pork Bun! So far Peach Blossoms has the BEST Char Siew Bao as the skin was so so fluffy that no other hotel chinese restaurants can do it. And the filling was not too sweet. Overall it's melt in the mouth!Overall their food quality was quite good, slightly higher than other 5 star hotel chinese restaurants that I've visited, except some of the dim sum and their dessert really needs much improvements! If only the service can be warm and better, this place will be perfect. I felt that with this price of SGD58++ per person for only 2 hours buffet during weekend is quite rush. Most people would rather go for Jade@Fullerton at only $38++ with free flow tea for about the same dining hours

We ate there on our first evening in Singapore and were not dissapointed.
We were well explained and advised, and the food was good.
Expensive, especially the drinks, as everythere in that area.
5
Service was prompt and the staff was very attentive. Great tasting food coupled with nice ambience. An overall great and satisfying experience. Would strongly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for an enjoyable dining experience.
5
First time in Singapore and at this restaurant. Stayed at Marina Mandarin and thought we would try the Chinese restaurant Peach Blossoms. The food was absolutely beautiful. Our waitress Vivian was terrific. She was so helpful, welcoming and friendly. The chef cooked food to our preference and modified the menu items to suit us personally.We would strongly recommend you visit this restaurant.(We were en route from Australia to Scotland and will be sure to visit this restaurant next time

Peach Blossoms have introduced an old-school concept to their restaurant. They are bringing back the Dim sum trolley. I liked this concept, as it brings back memories of yester-years and my visits to Hong Kong, where you look out for trollies with your favourite dim sum and you enjoy the whole dining experience. The dim sum trolley is available for lunch on weekdays and weekends and it’s a buffet, where you have over 61 items to choose from for weekdays and more for weekends. I came on a weekday lunch with a friend and we ate till we were more than stuffed. From the Dim sum trolley, which is pushed around by the waitresses and you can pick what you like:- Steamed ‘Phoenix’ feet with oyster sauce: The chicken feet were deep fried and then steamed with oyster sauce and cut chilli. Its mildly spicy.- Steamed pork spare rib with black bean: I liked this. The pork ribs were tender and tasty.- Steamed radish cake with preserved meat: You get a cube of radish cake which is yellowish in color. I like the texture and taste of this. This was gone in no time.- Siew mai: Petite in size, easy to put into the mouth and eat. Not bad.- Steamed Honey glazed pork bun:- Steamed Har Gao: Small petite sized yummy goodness. Nice.- Baked egg tart: Thin flaky crust and the egg filling was soft and smooth.- Steamed vegetarian crystal dumpling with assorted wild mushroom: I found the skin a little on the thicker side, but fillings were nice.- Steamed chicken with wolfberries and Chinese wine: This was good. Meat was tender and juicy and I even drank the soup.- Poached Shrimp dumpling in Szechuan spicy sauce: Tangy sauce which gave the dish a good kick. For the ala-carte specials- Whole abalone and wanton in superior broth: This was good. I loved the soup, which is slow boiled with old mother hens. The whole abalone was also nice and had a good bite. Recommended!- Bird’s nest on steamed egg white: The bird nest had no taste. But when you eat this with the pieces of Yunnan ham, which was salty, it added a new dimension to the dish.- Baked lobster with cheese: Half a lobster which is topped with cheese and baked. It’s fresh and delicious.- Pan-fried foie gras with smoked duck served on fried mantou: This was unique. It’s like a Chinese hamburger, with BBQ sauce drizzled over it. Eating with chopsticks was a bummer though, as you had to eat the items individually. The foie gras is the strar ingredient of this dish. We ended the meal with a glass bowl of Chilled mango puree with sago and pomelo. It’s nice and refreshing and it’s a good end to the meal.It’s nice to be able to enjoy this dim sum trolley concept, which is hard to find in Singapore

Dining at Peach Blossom has always been an enjoyable experience. We are regulars at Peach Blossom and has been for past 5 years. The standard of food has always been consistent. Even when we host dinners with more than 30 people. The dim sum dishes are also very good. Service and ambiance is good. Good for business entertainment too as they have private rooms
1
My family was at the restaurant this afternoon. Surprisingly this restaurant was only treated their regular guests with the warm hospitality. As we are the first timer we did not receive what a normal customer should receive. No staff take our order or served drink after sat down for more than 10 minutes, no change of plate, order was forgotten etc..

Came here for yumcha and dim-sum on a Sunday. The food here is at high quality, for us coming from HK also felt the dim-sum here is of very good standard.You have stunning view of MBS while enjoy your meal. Price is expensive and portion is small, as expected in a top 5 class hotel. Size of dim-sum is tiny. Recommend for business lunch or a good treat for family

We ordered their specialties- beef wagyou and prawns with wasabi and mayo. The beef was tender and cooked just right. It had lychees which was unusual and heightened the meat's flavor. The prawns were big, topped with roe and were equally delicious. Fried rice with fish roe completed our meal. Even the jasmine tea that was served was good quality.Since we are staying at Marina Mandarin and it was raining, dining here was convenient. The setting is similar to most high end Chinese restaurants. We did not get to enjoy the view as mentioned in other reviews. Our table was far away from the window. Nevertheless, it was a very good meal

This is an excellent place to eat lovely ambience, great food and exceptional service staff must mention Nobel who is gem among service staff. I have no hesitation in recommending this restaurant to all of the people I know.

Ate dinner here with my team. We ordered a couple of dishes which included this fried soft shell crab and wasabi prawn which was really really good. The ambiance was typical fine dining Chinese resto, service was ok, but what won me over were those two dishes. Would come back to order them if ever I am in the area. The place is good for both family and business gatherings

Food is good but service is spotty during Chinese New Year period. We have no issues with the food nor the pace of food being served but the staff are simply too overwhelmed to be able to remember other requests.

There on business we decided on the meal for 2. Expecting a real feast we ended up still hungry at the end and for 200 Singapore dollars including a little wine monstrously expensive. Two soup courses, no rice, grumpy staff no return.

Came to dine with my family and ordered a few dishes and it was excellent! The Multigrain Rice and 3 Eggs Spinach are my recommendations, loved the textures and flavour of the rice.Service is great and the ambience is really relaxing with the wooden decor. Would recommend others to come and will definitely be back soon

The setup and ambiance is very good. Very Chinese decorations with hostesses in cheongsam. There are many round tables which could sit up to 12-14 pax. We could see that the restaurant has tried to come up with new and special dishes to stand out among the other restaurants. But unfortunately, my family and I agreed that after eating there for 3 times in the last year, the "unique" dishes are not as good as the classic dishes. For example, their "normal" siew mai is better than their specialty quail egg siew mai. Overall, though the food is average, i felt that the price was slightly high considering the quality of food. But I must say that the setting of the restaurant was very cosy

This is now our 10th meal at Peach Blossoms, at least, since we often stay at the Marina Mandarin Hotel when in Singapore. We love the quality of the food, the ambiance of the restaurant and the ease of access when staying at the hotel. Everything is excellent except they let themselves down with easily fixed logistic errors.First they serve all the dishes so quickly without warming stands that you feel under pressure to eat quickly so that the dishes are still warm when consumed. All they need to do is have warming stands or to be prepared to serve dishes in a sequential order.Second, we ordered a bottle of wine and each time our glasses were empty we had to ask the waitress to serve more wine - either be more attentive, have a dedicated sommelier or place the wine bucket beside the table so you can self-serve.Prices are confident but not over the top considering the quality of the food. All in all a good dining experience that could so easily be a great dining experience if they paid more attention to the details described above.David

our first night at the hotel and to celebrate we thought we would have a good Chinese meal at Peach Blossom. The broccoli was over cooked, the spring rolls were soggy, the rice tasted like it had been cooked in old oil, the prawns in egg tasted like they had been rolled in sand first but the worst thing was that although we had left more than 80% of our meal not once were we asked if everything was ok!! very disappointing...

The restaurant is actually pretty small but it creates a cozy atmosphere and you ask for a table by a window, you'll get to enjoy a very nice view of the Singapore skyline. Overall, the food was really good and the service excellent. I highly recommend the wasabi prawns. The only trouble is actually how to find the entrance to the Marina Mandarin hotel from Marina Square Shopping Center
5
The look of the restaurant from outside is quite interesting including inside when you walk in. The seat is comfortable with varieties of foods to choose. I am during the abalone promotion with abalone set menu. I enjoy the taste of the food here. Furthermore, staffs are very friendly and help you with all the description of the food. I might suggest the soya chicken, abalone and soup.the price is quite reasonable compared with the food we ordered. This restaurant is quite highly recommended to visit

I had the set lunch there, had low expectations as it was not ala carte but pretty decent , nice sweet and sour pork. Roast duck and chicken combination was great too. However, didn't rate it a five as it is rather standard fare though well prepared, no special differentiating factor that caught my attention. Service was efficient and the decor was great, worthy of photographs; nice view of the harbour and not too cramped like the restaurants in the malls, space is a commodity in singapore. Would recommend if you are avoiding the common noisy chinese restaurant
5
Went there alone but the staff was very helpful in making the selection. They even adapted for my taste the Wagyu beef by replacing the longan with asparagus. The seafood rice was outstanding too. Yes, it is an expensive place but that is kind of expected
5
This is an excellent restaurant with wonderful Chinese food, with a more modern approach and dishes you rarely find in other countries. Although this is in an expensive hotel, this was very reasonably priced provided you do not choose wine.
5
Lovely food & ambience. The menu is extensive & there are also set menus for those who can't decide. The real birds outside in the atrium sing for you during the daylight hours - just enjoy!

Not quite a crisis, but it was an unexpected situation that excellently managed by the restaurant staffs and making things amicable for the diners.I was having my birthday dinner at the restaurant on 2/Mar, just as we have started the dinner, suddenly some lights went off and next to minimum light source, by then the restaurant staff informed us there was a fire on the same floor and restaurant kitchen need to cease operation right away, so our dinner have to be discontinued. The staffs quickly offered us to dine at alternate restaurant on the next floor, so that the celebration will not be affected.when we got to the next floor restaurant, everything have set up for us nicely, complimentary wines were provided as a gesture for the inconvenience caused. best of all, we also need not pay for the meals....a wonderful way of customer relationship management.Like to place on record for this commendable action by the restaurant staffs

A very nice setting but sadly the food was bland and uninspiring. The peeking duck was delivered to the table in very small pancakes, we would have preferred to have done our own. The pancakes were tiny and very thin. The skin was not at all crispy. The soft shelled crab had a sad heavy coating and lacked flavour. The noodles with the remaining duck meat were very bland. The clay pot chicken was definitely the best part of the meal. We were encouraged to have rice dumplings for dessert, these were small chewing gum textured balls with dried longon, wolfberries and lotus bean paste in a warm sweet liquid. Sounded great but they were AWFUL! Cost approximately Â£90 and we came out hungry. Not to be recommended

First of all, I need to highlight that items that I ordered are all in Individual portion. Food is served in per plate per pax. I was puzzled that presentation and serving of food was all served together! First came my soup, Almond with Fish Maw Soup very quickly follow by appetiser Soft Shell Crab w Salted Egg which is fine. Quite immediately after appetiser is served came Peking Duck with Foie Gras, by which time we were struggling to drink the soup, eat the crab and Peking Dark. And the rest of dishes follow suit. When Wagyu Beef with Longan arrive, I was quite annoyed and displeased and told the server to please hold the dishes till we are almost done with at least 70% of what is on the Table. As by which time there are about 8 plates for 2 diners.The last dish Seasonal Veg with Abalone was still served immediately despite my my request to hold dishes till we clear the table.Being Chinese myself, I understand if I order the dishes as a whole plate to share...it's definitely fine to serve few dishes all at one go.But with an individual pax serving..I think the server should have an eye for details ie. be prepared or standby the kitchen when guests is almost done with one of the dish before you present the next. I think it's a normal dining standards for restaurants like Peach Blossom. . The manager who took our order was friendly and cheerful. But the Service staff were kinda impatient...giving that can you help to make way for these plates I'm holding??!!! Service standard was not exactly good as compare to food standard.The bill was $230 for 2 pax. It wasn't exactly a good dining experience

Signature dishes like wagyu beef with longan and wasabi-mayonnaise prawns continued to be very good. Service personnel were very courteous and professional. We couldn't decide on the choice of noodle or rice. Service attendant politely recommended their one of their specialty fried rice, which was a very good choice. He also asked if we wanted the dishes served at the same time (like typical Chinese family meal) or one after another (like Western meals).Restaurant ambience was good - background music didn't overpower conversations, window view of MBS, S'pore Flyer, Mandarin Oriental Hotel & sky made the restaurant bright and wide (not claustrophobic) & pleasant Chinese decor.Complimentary parking is available when dining payment is S$50 or more

We had lunch. The dim sum was very nice with quite a good variety. I don't eat meat, but friends I was with had the Peking duck and it was good. The meat dim sum was also very good.The service is excellent except the uniforms should be looked into. The slim waitresses look very good in them, however the plump and shorter waitresses look terrible in them and there was even one waitress that had a split near the zipper and was walking around without even knowing

This must be our sixth or seventh dinner at Peach Blossoms in the Marina Mandarin and we love the chef's signature dishes particularly Almond soup with fish maw and Wagyu beef. We have tried to get them to serve dishes selected sequentially but they always seem to come together without warming stands, so you either race the excellent food down your throat or eat some of it cold. Easily fixed by thinking about service logistics more. Also on this occasion the service was attentive to the point of being irritating - virtually watching you to swallow a mouthful or serve the last items from a dish before whipping it away. All in all felt like pressure to eat and get out, not assisted by the need to rush to eat the food while hot. It was not like this on previous occasions that we dined at Peach Blossoms so we will probably go again and see if we can get the dinner served in a sequence.At the prices charged, the restaurant fails to do justice to its excellent chef and needs to lift its game.David

I travelled with my family and on our last night at the hotel we decided to try Peach Blossoms. The food was average and overpriced. We ordered the Peking Duck and could barely eat it. Was full of bones - I've eaten Peking Duck many times and not come across this so not sure what the idea is but a lot was wasted due to the bones.Service was also disappointing as the staff focused on the local customers. It was clear we were toursits and guests of the hotel (perhaps the staff figure we may not return so no need to provide good service?). At one point the chef came out and did the rounds of the restaurant, focusing on the locals - we were all but ignored.Were provided the dessert menu however our waiter never returned to our table so we had to forgoe dessert, get the bill and leave

This restaurant has such great Chinese vegetarian dishes, but what really caught my attention was the free appetizer pickles given as a complimentary starter, I think the best pickled vegetable dishI have ever tasted. I asked for three bowls of it, and was graciously granted willingly with a smile. I would have been happy with that and rice, but am glad I had three other vegetarian dishes which were delicious. Nice ambience. Great service

My first dinner upon arriving in Singapore when I entertained three ladies from my old school. I did not choose the meal but it was very good and I believe we all enjoyed it.

Food and service very good...atmosphere was great.....but expensive and drink prices a little over the top
5
I would come and stay at the marina mandarin just to eat here, the dim sum buffet is incredible, and the choice staggering! Beautiful dim sum with attentive staff. My favourite dim sum restaurant in the world!
5
we had yum cha on our last day and wished we had of had an evening meal; pricey but worth a treat to yourselves; stick to chinese tea and it keeps the costs down!

The quality of the food was matched by the service.

I try to avoid to eat in hotels because the menu there is usually limited and prices high. In cause of Peach Blossom in Marina Mandarin it works - the prices are exorbitant and the food quality is average comparing to the Singapore in the whole

One of my favorite Chinese restaurants in Singapore, Peach Blossom provides contemporary chinese cuisine in a nice quiet setting. I strongly reccomend a party of 4-6 people as any lesser, you wouldn't be able to order an assortment of dishes enough to compliment your palate. To start off, the soft shell crabs in salted egg yokes were delightfully cripsy. It's also not overly salted and the egg yoke coating wasn't soggy either unlike many Chinese eateries. Next up, the Peking duck. It cost about $70 per duck and serves about 15 servings of tiny little crepes packing in the fragrant duck skin, cucumbers and the delectable sauce too. It is unlikely u would stop at 2 crepes. The seafood fried rice with salmon roe was delicious too and to think we polished our bowls thoroughly even towards the end of the dinner is a compliment enough for this simple but tasty dish
5
Soft shell crabs, which are difficult to cook without being oily, I always regard them at a test of a true chef, and boy I've been served some horrors. Here they, as was all the food of the highest standard and truly succulent, service was creditable and we would have to give it a massive 10/10, and we never have gone over 8/10 even at our favourite comfort food restaurant, congratulations to the management and staff, they rounded off a wonderful da

We stayed at the Marina Mandarin for two nights and the restaurant was recommended online.The menu was varied and slightly confusing regarding cost per portion/person.The staff were very helpful in choosing, in serving and in attention to detail. The food was very good, some of the best scallops (chinese style) I have had. For a higher end restaurant with good service, the value was good

Am sure there are better dim sum places but because my husband and I didn't have enough time to hunt for one and we were also hungry, we decided to eat at peach blossoms since we were staying in the same hotel anyway. Surprisingly, the dim sum was really good... Not a wide variety but taste was very good... We also had noodles with chicken along with a selection of dim sum, best one is the steamed pork in soy sauce with chopped red chilies! I love spicy food and this was our fave!!!
