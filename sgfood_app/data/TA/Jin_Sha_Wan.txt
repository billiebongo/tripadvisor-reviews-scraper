I was the one who initiated Trip Advisor to add this eatery in order for one that's me who's been visiting this joint for past 18 months. Thanks to my Friend, William who certainly knows where the good Zhi char stall to patronise.In the past 4 weeks. I had a couple of dinners here. Located nearby Kovan in a small coffee shop with an open air concept. The signature dish here is the curry fish head. Fresh fish head & in an awesome curry broth on hot fire sitting in a Claypot. The generosity of beautiful lady fingers, egg plants, cabbage. Despite the massive vegetables, don't ignore their recommendation of local fried vegetables with garlic. It's outstanding.Their other signature dishes got to be the salted egg crab which is absolutely delicious, more like in heaven if the crab is female n had lots of roe.The night we were there. We had also a beautiful steamed fish. Fresh no doubt, a delight to finish it leaving just the bones. Also, their sambal potato leaves leave me very happy, eagerly waiting to return to the place fir another feast.Another sambal dish. The sea shells (la la) using the same sambal dried shrimp was cooked to perfection. Whet in the mouth.Always a night of full fulfilment n contentment leaving the restaurant a happy man.
