First visit to Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao, tried their Pan Fried Dumplings. It's quite tasty. Not the best dumplings, but definitely above average as compared to many others I have tried.

Their Xiao Long Bao & Zhechuan Spicy Wonton are just so delicious and price is sooo... reasonable, XLB $6 (10pcs) & ZSW $4.5 (10pcs). I doubled the order after happy face eating their good.

I come here quite often since the food is delicious and the owners are really nice. It seems like a litte family business which everyone should support!

Hawker centre stall serves XLB, dumplings and noodles. XLB are the best and well worth a trip. Noodles more average. Surroundings are pretty chaotic and rough, be prepared to clean your own table.

Great, down to earth food place to get your Xiao Long Bao fix! Authentic and reasonably priced. Be prepared to sweat though, as no AC.

Best i hv eaten so far. 10 pcs of dumpling going for $5. Its worth it. You can ask for chilli oil tas a dip. Delicious. It found on the red section, a short distance walk from escalator nearest to one tooth relic temple.

Quite reluctant to give good review as when I ate 2 years ago there was hardly queue but now getting more and more popular that queue is getting longer and longer. Best hong you chow shou (chilli oil dumpling) that i have ever eaten and best xiao long bao (standard not below Ding Tai Fung). Price is $6 for 10pcs xiao long bao and $4.50 for 8pcs chilli oil dumpling. Really value for money

The only place I've ever tried XLB was at Din Tai Fung in Seattle. Even though others love it, I never thought it was that good and just assumed XLB was supposed to be that way. My views on XLB changed after going to Zhong Guo La Mian. For about $4.50 USD you get 10 amazingly juicy and perfectly steamed XLB that packs so much amazing flavor that you'll crave for months. If I can find a way back to Singapore, this spot is a must stop

Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao wanted to try this place for a while now. Located in Blk 335 Smith St #02-135, Chinatown Complex Market .Itâ€™s great to be able to see their dumplings being made by hand, Just watching the chefs preparing the dumplings in front of you was a delight. The handmade dumplings with various fillings are delicious. The dumplings were fresh, juicy and the skin wrapper was delicate and thin. These were better than any that I've had at Din Tai Fung or any other soup dumping restaurant, we order their Xiao Long Bao was only ($6 for 10), are quite good, again perfectly made and delicate and very moist. The Szechuan wonton ($ 4 for 10) is a unique flavor of vinegar and spicy oil, and it's not for everyone. It might be an acquired taste, definitely worth checking out while you're in Chinatown. Be prepared to queue for some time because this place is highly visited, waiting time can be 30 minutes over, try to avoid peak times around noon and 6pm. big plus also goes for the service is efficient, and the staff were friendly and thoughtful
