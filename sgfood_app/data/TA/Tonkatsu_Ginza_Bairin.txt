Everything was good.
The staff is always friendly and courteous and it's pretty easy to be seated without reservations.

My favourite type of don - unagi with egg! Nom nom. This don comes with a bowl of miso soup and is priced at 20.50.

Best lunch for only $17 a set with soup
Pickles rice salad and separated dressing
Better than equivalent in Melb which would cost double
Highly recommended
Have desert at 3 shops down Bake Cheese Tart

I really love this restaurant. Reminds me of my last Japan trip. I had their pork tonkatsu set 100gr.. the set comes with rice and soup. Very nice will come back again to try another menu

Ever since I came to Singapore for tertiary studies this place has been one of my favourite restaurants in Singapore. I've been eating here regularly (once every 2-3 weeks) since 2011. I recently came to Singapore on vacation and tried this restaurant again.Not disappointed. Still as good as I can remember, still makes the highlight of my meals in Singapore. Over the years I've been here there were also a lot of Japanese people dining in, so you know it's legit.I always get the Special Pork Katsudon, the egg topping on it is perfect. Might seem a bit pricey (to me at least) at SGD20, but well worth it

Yup, their tonkatsu is very well done and authentic taste, so good that even Japanese here says it is similar to theirs back home. And that is as good as it gets! Have always anjoyed a hearty meal here and it did not disappoint. When there is a special promotion, the crowd may cause a longer waiting time to be served though, but the servers are usually rushing around and not idling (unless it is off peak meal times).Note: Order out front and pay in advance before entering the restaurant. Free seating, fuss free, fast food service. But still, clean and nice ambience (brawling kids could be a problem though). So it is kids friendly. Serves alcohol too. Famous for their pork but have other meals too. Slighlt more expensive than food court, but hey, this is a Japanese restaurant, and the tasty food is value for money

We had the Tonkatsu Donburi with fried pork and egg served in a bowl of rice with savory sauce. We also ordered a side of fried Ebi prawn , which was not entirely fresh tasting as the meat was mushy and soft. We found the food average tasting but the ambience and seating was not the most comfortable, fast food setting

Ginza Bairin has one of the best tonkatsu I like. I always go for there for the donburi but the latest I tried the curry tonkatsu. It tasted great too. The miso soup is refillable and most of the time I will have 2 bowls. Very good to go with the meal!

Had a take-out just recently for the family - Wife had the Special Fillet Katsu-don, son had the Katsu Curry and I had the Pork Loin Katsu Set. All were delicious and filling. This would be about the 6th time we had Tonkatsu from Ginza Bairin and the flavour, texture and quality of the meats have been consistent. Still the best Tonkatsu I had so far

The Tonkatsu is succulent and crispy, tender and juicy. Very generous portions of meat, cabbage and rice. I had the Black pig tonkatsu.
The setup in the restaurant is casual and sometimes food takes some time to be ready as it is quite popular.

It was really a good deal, it was a lot of food for the price. It's a good place to stop if you're shopping in the mall. The seating at the stand is clean and the service is really fast.

Tried the Pork Cutlet set with curry, which was good. Meat was juicy yet not too fat and platter was crispy. Katsu curry was very tasty and rich too. If u have Ion card, show them to get 10% discount.

Yes, this is one of the best Black Pig Tonkatsu resto in Singapore. The taste is always consistent , most of the lunch/dinner time you have to queue as the space is not really that big & bit noisy too.

There is 1-1 promotion because of its anniversary. Its the first time my bf and I were trying the tonkatsu at this place. Its quite value for money. We had the iberican pork curry. The tonkatsu was crispy and juicy, with a good balance of the amount of meat and fats. The curry tasted normal. We waited a little while to get a seat as there were quite a lot of people

Visited twice so far and have been served both times with Tonkatsu that was lightly crisp on the outside (not too oily) and juicy and flavourful on the inside. Food arrived very quickly on both occasions too, despite the dinner crowd. It's our new go-to spot in Orchard for a Tonkatsu fix

For those of you who have fallen in love with soupy Japanese ramen Tokyo style, Tonkatsu Ginza Bairin caters to a busy crowd especially during peak hours. Located at Ion's food gallery floor, the seats are pretty close and you can peer into what your neighbours are ordering.There are many combinations and I would opt for the traditional ones. Best eaten on an empty stomach as the helping is quite filling. A great place to go to if you are really hungry

I love the Tonkatsu Curry rice at Ginza Bairin. The Pork Chop is crispy on the outside and meat is juicy on the inside. The Japanese curry was good, not spicy at all. Their Pork Katsudon rice is very delicious as well. I feel this is the best Tonkatsu Pork Chop in Singapore

I found this restaurant about two years ago on a visit to Singapore. The tonkatsu is as good as I've found in Tokyo, so I always return to this one every time I'm in Singapore. We were only in Singapore for six days this last time and our hotel wasn't close to it. But we made certain we had two lunches here. It is worth making a visit to Orchard Road just to eat here

Decided to try Tonkatsu Ginza Bairin while in Ion Mall as we fancied a Quick bite to eat.I had the standard pork katsu curry with rice. Batter was nice and crispy, if not a little bit oily tasting. Meat was nice and moist. Curry sauce was very nice.If one doesn't like battered Tonkatsu style, there really isn't anything else on the menu.I would definitely eat here again if in Ion and looking for a quite bite. However, I wouldn't say it's a destination restaurant
