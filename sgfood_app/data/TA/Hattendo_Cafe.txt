Long queues formed outside this famous snack chain from Japan when it first opened here but their latest offerings of melon buns and muffins are a lot better than their original buns.

Custard cream bun was weird. The cream was light and fluffy but a really weird Combi w the bread. Bread tasted like over-soft airline bread. Taste of bread was Weird too, doesn't complement the cream. Texture of bread wasn't nice and sticks to ur teeth or mouth. Over priced place which charges 1.00 for ice water.

dropped by this place for a quick snack on way home - its location is great - just by the MRT station. being our first time there, we asked quite a few questions about the various fillings (level of sweetness) before making up our minds. the staff (didn't get his name) was very patient and made recommendations. He was the only person manning the counter at 6plus pm. he was efficient and polite. great service and overall the bun was nice and went well with black tea

Hattendo Cafe is a Japanese style cafe located in Tanjong Pagar, the center of Singapore's financial district. Despite its busy, metropolitan surroundings, Hattendo Cafe offers a relaxing environment best suited for a meet up with friends or a quick, relaxing escape session from daily life. The cafe specializes in cream buns and also serves coffee and burgers. Everything is homemade- in fact, there is one section of the cafe that allows customers to experience the pastry's baking process. One feature that I would like to note is the making of the cream puff's cream/paste, In addition, the cafe has free wifi and has excellent service.I would like to praise Kurniawan, one of the cafe's employees, for providing fantastic customer service along with a friendly, helpful attitude. In my years of restaurant reviewing and cafe-hopping, I have rarely seen an employee with as positive of a demeanour of Kurniawan's.While at Hattendo Cafe, I had the Long Black (Coffee) as well as the ice late. Both drinks were wonderful and were reasonably priced, especially for such a central location such as Tanjong Pagar. I would highly recommend Hattendo Cafe to everyone. I will surely come back again and I look forward to my next visit

Surprisely for a Sunday afternoon, the place was pretty crowded. The female manning the cashier was working half heartedly. One could see that she had already to leave as her friends were waiting for her to knock off from work. She kept interrupting the staff in the kitchen, whom one could see having problems keeping an eye on the stove through the open kitchen. One could not help but notice that he had thrown what was on the pan to the bin. For an order of french toast, I had waited almost 30 minutes for it.French Toast($9.00)Selected custard bun for the dish, which was pan fried with slightly top and bottom. It was served with pieces of fruit such as lemon, kiwi, blue berries, orange and strawberries, and a scoop of vanilla ice cream by the side. The caramelised crust of the bun gave a different feel to the bun.Topup $2.50 for a cup of hot tea to go with it

These bread buns are filled with a range of plain or flavoured cream /custard. You have a choice of a soft bun or the melon version which is meant to have a crispy top (those familiar with bolo buns from Chinese style bakeries will know all about this). On this visit we had the soft bun version of the original cream and red bean cream. The filling was not Tok sweet which is a plus point. We had a good coffee to go with our little snack. Service is friendly and efficient. If you prefer the traditional choux pastry style cream puffs, these might not be for you

Tried the matcha bun with tea. It's a good deal and the cream is rich cold and buttery. The melon bun with a crispy exterior is also good with the cream inside.

Cream was very fresh. $2.50 to $3.50 each for the custard, asuki and matcha. Worth trying ! Long queue at lunch time and it is sold out by 9.30 p.m

No-so-sweet custard puffs. Level of sweetness is fine, though perhaps we had too high expectations on the custard. The puffs were not as fluffy as I prefer. It's a nice dessert, but nothing to crow about.
