I will always pop by whenever I am at Katong area and I love the dark chocolate ice-cream which I can't recall the actual name.

Decided to come here after a family meal in Katong! Tried the strawberry basil on a thyme cone, great for a Summer's day treat :)

How can I go back to having normal flavored gelato now that I have tried the Chamomile Torch Ginger Blossoms from Birds of Paradise? The spread of flavors makes you want to come back oh so often.

We shared a delicious strawberry basil gelato in a waffle thyme-flavored cone. A nice break on our stroll in the Katong area.

The thyme infused waffle cones are a different but, tasty treat. We loved the strawberry basil and the chrysanthemum flavour. Fun and interesting.

As a Katong native, I am joyful for budding young entrepreneurs to set artisan ice-cream shops like Birds of Paradise, giving a new lease of life to the precinct. There is always a queue at this store. So I never bothered. Today, at an off-peak hour, I decided to drop in to get a scoop of gelato. Mind you, I am an ice-cream fan. Open up by freezer and you will find a wide range of ice-cream Flavours ....in tubs. Yes, the ice cream is more than the frozen food. Perhaps I have been so spoilt. Having been round the world eating ice-cream... Perhaps the hype overweighted my expectations. I tasted the white chrysanthemums and one other flavour.....it was all too sweet. I asked for a flavour that is less sweet....the recommended mint cacao hits the right spot. And I am usually not a fan of mint ice-creams but I am a huge herbal person. Love the presentation of the shop. Would like to explore other Flavours another time ...

Amazing gelato taste! Tried the Lychee Raspberry and Earl Grey Lemongrass, really great flavours and not too sweet! A double scoop in a cup costs $7.70! Staff are patient and friendly to allow tasting of flavours even when there is already a queue! Will definitely return!

Situated along the popular Katong street, it was very crowded with diners after their dinner. The outlet is simply yet tastefully done up. 4 staff were there to help their customers out. Tried the lemongrass ginger flavour as well as the chocolate. 2 scoops of ice cream was $7.70 but added $1 for the chocolate flavour. Ice cream is just right, not too sweet! Check out the photos taken. Will return to try other flavou

I, myself tried when they first open (service was superb!) and would like to introduce to my friend yesterday evening but utterly disappointed with the staff's behaviour. So it was my friend's 1st on botanical flavored gelato, we asked to try Spiced Pear & White Chrysanthemum. I have decided to get 1 scoop of Spiced Pear (wanted with cone but sold out). While my friend was not sure about WC, he asked the staff if he could try Lychee Raspberry. Her face immediately turned black & asked if there are any other flavors we would like to try in a higher pitch & fake smile. Being treated in such manner, we knew we could just leave but we decided to get not 1 but 2 scoops of the gelato (WC & SP) plus the crunch nibbles (this is good). We find LR abit too sweet. Will we return? No.

We knew this place would be great from the size of the queue when we walked past. They serve the ice cream on thyme flavoured cones, which might sound strange but tasted really good. All the flavours are unique and interesting. We tried the strawberry basil, and the chrysanthemum flavour. Both were delicious, although the chrysanthemum was my personal favourite.

Try their gelatos with the infused waffle cones. When I went they had rosemary waffle cones which were absolutely divine.
5
Ice-cream that tastes so natural and not too sweet, I've made several trips there to try out all the flavours!
5
Love the variety of ice creams that they have. Must try white chrysanthemum and also basil. A pity they do not have seats.
5
I have to say, excellent gelato with intriguing botanical flavors! I tried them all but my favourite was the White Chrysanthemum. Loved it! My sister loved the Lychee and Raspberry. Will definitely visit soon!
5
We tried the chrysanthemum gelato and also the lemongrass ginger gelato - both in the thyme wafer cones and both excellent! There were other interesting flavors to sample too. Would definitely return for more.

Just 6 flavours a day but each, a slice of heaven!
A great place for desserts after a meal in the Katong area.

Lychee raspberry: rose tinged freshness.
Basil: subtle and goes well with the thyme cone.
Acai pomegranate: almost chocolatey.
Pandan: my favorite
Lemongrass ginger: this..was amazing
5
Quaint little place run by a cool guy, flavors with a twist, offering some unique local combinations, love the lemongrass flavor.
Very smooth and natural taste, as its all handmade.
Definitely worth a visit if you are into Gelato!
Reminded me of Gelato Messina Australia!

Really enjoyed the ice cream we had here today. Between the 3 of us we had pandan and fig + vanilla, chrysanthemum and lychee + raspberry, basil and spiced pear. I thought the best ones were spiced pear and fig and vanilla. Generous portions, very tasty had made cones, although I think this was more ice cream than gelato. Thought slightly pricey at $7.70 for a double scoop, but worth trying.
