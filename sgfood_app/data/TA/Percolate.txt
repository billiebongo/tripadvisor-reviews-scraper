My friend really loves Baby Breath so we picked this place for that! Turned out coffee was good and lightly roasted with an authentic flavor. Percolate has a lovely ambiance with light jazz music. Perfect for an easy evening chat or meet up.

Filter coffee options are limited to Kenya and Columbia from Singapore and UK breweries and taste is good. Black velvet cake is worth to try. Very friendly and helpful staff and place is more crowded than one would expect in this area. Recommended!

Staff was very nice explaining their coffee when I enquired.Ambience was nice.seating arrangement was reasonably spacious,does not have the cramp feeling like some cafe. Matcha yuzu cake is special. Drinking water was free flow. Overall good experience.

Delightful hideaway for a cuppa in the middle of the heartland.
Decent selection of drinks and snacks to have time alone, or gathering of friends to catch up or wile away the time.
Pleasant and helpful staff.

Stopped by for a quick coffee while running some classes in this neighbourhood. Simple cup of long black to try the place with a slice of orange poppyseed loaf. Fantastic cuppa coffee. The loaf was delicious - moist, flavorful with the orange rind and poppy seeds, just right amount of sweetness.Nice ambiance to spend some quality time alone or with company. This is a great cafe in the hidden neighbourhood area.

If you are looking for a full robust coffee in Bedok area then you MUST visit Percolate. A little on the expensive side however the coffee and milk are of high quality. We enjoyed the Santa Petrona coffee bean - El Salvador. They have a range of patries n croissants. Quite delicious though i came for the coffee. It's hard to find good coffee in Singapore. The name brand coffee joints are really ordinary when compared to cafes like Percolate. Excellent house music. Smallish cafe seating approx 50 the decor is modern n fresh. A short walk from Bedok Mall along Bedok North Street 1 to the T intersection - Percolate is almost opposite.

Talking about it and Im hungry now!Good lightings for good photo shot too!A recommended neighbourhood cafe with good services!Yums,Jazly

Nicely tucked in a corner of a housing estate. Atmosphere is good but when it gets crowded, its comparable to a marketplace I can only recommend to locals (I don't see how and why any tourist would wanna be here) who wants a quiet spot @ prices below Starbucks but don't expect much frills or super comfy seats

Love the ambience and cozy little place. It does get crowded on weekends but never the less it has great coffee n good variety of cakes. Good hangout place with friendly staff. I am Over there nearly every alternate week or when i have friends to hang out

Was brought here by a friend who lives locally and is a regular to Percolate. He recommended the Chicken Tom Yam Ciabatta sandwich which was like a Thai Curry in a roll and very tasty. Friendly atmosphere and modern decor with tables inside and out. The service was personal and friendly and I would definitely return if `I am in the area again. Next time would try out the cakes which looked really good

Had a cup of latte. Nice environment, small cozy..but it does get crowded on the weekends. Sitting outside may be hot with the local weather. My favourite time is after dinner in the evenings. Slow jazzy music...just a great place to relax and u wind. They serve several pastries, tasty for most cakes. Good service from the counter staff - friendly and polite

Percolate was our first coffee hop for Sunday. Staff were extremely warm and friendly. Service was great too. I had a long black and a carrot cake. The long black unfortunately wasn't to my liking, I found it extremely acidic. I took a few sips and gave up. It was rich and strong and well made but very sour. Perhaps I could have ordered a cappuccino or .....something that has milk in it. The carrot cake on the other hand was rich and moist and full of flavour. Love it

Passby this cafe a few times so decided to drop by for tea on a weekend. It was very packed inside and most table would at least order a cup of coffee. I ordered a take-away for their signature Peanut butter chocolate banana cake. It's not too sweet but the taste of the cream is salty and sweet. May not be everyone's liking. I may come back again if there's available table but most likely will try their coffee instead.

Staffs are friendly and very kind. Our drinks are served to us and they even told us where we can get the cutleries and plain water from. Coffee is well made and the earl grey tea was very well presented. It is served in a small transparent teapot with a small glass. Desserts are also sold in the cafe. Like red velvet cake and some other pastry. Price is acceptable as it is priced similarly to other cafes in Singapore Cafe was originally very small and cosy with very pretty interior. Now, it has expanded and is bigger, Yet to go there for a second visit! Would definitely go there again

Hidden inconspicuously in one of the suburbs in Singapore. A rather good independent cafe with a range of choices of coffees, and an interesting selection of cakes. If you are in the Bedok area, you should definitely try it. Sure beats going to a soulless global coffee chain. The staff are impeccably polite

Very friendly staff who took pride in explaining their different coffees to my partner and me, we ordered the curry croissants and tom yum chicken sandwich to go with our coffee, and the food sas very good. Read the newspapers provided and had a great time.

We had a cappucino and some sort of tea with cinnamon which my wife loved. Also a raspberry and chocolate pie which was amazing. You can sit inside or outdoors. It's a really nice place and my wife definitely preferred this one above Starbucks. Will go there again.

Little quaint cafe in the heartlands exudes quaint Japanese cafe vibe.Came with family so could really try almost everything on offer. Not too big a menu.Good coffee as expected since beans are from respected sources.Managed to try all their sandwiches (4 - ham&cheese, curry egg, salmon wasabi, chilli crab). All are delightful and well-made with the flavours coming through immediately as it enters the palate.Could do with a slightly expansive menu as long as service and quality is not compromised
