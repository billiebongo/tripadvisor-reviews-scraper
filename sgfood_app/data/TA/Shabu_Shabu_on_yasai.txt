Fresh food with tasty broth. Fast service. Fish was amazingly fresh. Try the herbal soup. The soy soup was odd but each to their own.

The food is very fresh and the soup is really good! The selection of sauces for the meat is also pretty wide and it's a good experience.

We came to this restaurant because our tour guide told us this was a very old convent that was restored and is now a restaurant. We ordered their lunch menu which is the prime menu, we get choices of herbal soup or mushroom truffle soup and much more, we were also served with fresh mussels, jumbo shrimp, clams, fish and variety of mushrooms. Absolutely great food and service, servers were so polite and helpful, I highly recommend this restaurant

3 tiers of dinner buffet menu. We chose the mid one @39.90++. Free flow of soft drinks @ 8++ extra is abit steep so we opted for green tea @1.90++ instead. Prawns and the seabass were fresh. Service was prompt. They have a fine spread of meat as well, a super plus point for meat lovers. would recommend the thinly sliced beef karubi with the golden truffle soup base. Down-side: the restaurant is quite hot with full house and the steam from hotpot. would be perfect if the AC temp was lower. ice cream was strictly limited to one serving/ pax. I would think the price paid should be covering unlimited

Lunch set is fine except vegetables are not very fresh and standard of meat is inconsistent.We are unfortunate enough to be served by an elder waiter named Jeffery if I didn't get his name wrong. His face clearly suggests how much he hates his job thus customers in the restaurant, we paid 10% service charge, but his trademark sour face made us feel that we owe him a living. When I asked him to top up the soup base, he looked really angry. Other than this particular waiter, other staff are all very helpful, especially Doreen with her usual warm smile. Would have rated this restaurant 'very good' if not for the rude waiter

It was my first time patronising the restaurant and I am quite sold on the restaurant. Had lunch on a weekday and the place started packing out close to half past noon when the office workers started streaming in. Service by the wait staff was prompt and they acceded to the requests we put in. I ordered the beef set and the 4 of us chose 2 soup base. While the soy soup took a while to boil, the soup bases were well prepared. While the meat was thinly sliced (I'm a meat lover btw), there were enough pieces to go around as well. The fresh vegetables are free-flow and we had at least 4 servings of it. The restaurant is also located in the central part of Singapore and would be an ideal place for a meal or a get-together

My niece and I recently had a shabu-shabu dinner at On-Yasai@Chijmes. We opted for the Value-Buffet@$39.90++/pax (fronted by a 5-meat platter with the usual 1.5-hr cap applicable).While buffet items like fresh veggies, roots, mushrooms, seafood, tempura, sushi were “unlimited” in serving, the dessert was strangely preordained and restricted to 1 small ice-cream only.Of the 8 different types of soup-bases available, we could opt for 2. Happily, there were many types of sauces, condiments and dips to challenge our creative mix-and-match skills.The finely-sliced raw meats, stacked choke-full on the serving tray, were served in their original form i.e. no application of enhancing or tenderizing substances.The signature Chicken Tsumire (minced meat/meatballs) as well as the quail eggs proved to be highly delectable items. We tried without any success to configure the minced meat into meatballs for the hotpot but ended up with a floating “bak-chor” broth (Chinese-style cuisine). While staff were generally attentive to our needs, it was oftentimes difficult for us to spot them anywhere.While there was a variegated spread of buffet and was truly a paradise for avid meat-eaters (not us, though), we were nevertheless disappointed with the lack of choice for the dessert

I visited this restaurant with 4 of my work collogues. This is a very good way to have a fun a social dinner .We tried different packages (the best way to select the food , easy way to choose )All the different meet I tried were very good, sliced thin. With the right amount of fat

I love shabu shabu but have never eaten it outside of Japan.Absolutelyl loved the Singapore adjustment which allowed me to cook the beef in a spicy soup while keeping the vegetables in the more traditional miso soup.Service was excellent and will definitely come back
