Having landed in Singapore and searching for an Indian joint for satisfying my home palate, it took a day to identify this restaurant. With predominantly yellow colored walls, this offers south Indian snacks apart from meals.I went for the south indian thali and added an omelette too. The sambar was Ok, but the yummy one was the kaarakozhambu. Butter milk was around too and lightly spiced rasam. All costing about 5.80 SGD
