Happened upon this place by chance on a street full of bars and restaurants. The gallettes, cheese and wine are excellent. Recommended for a casual dinner.
5
Stopped by for a late lunch and had the caramel apple crepe. I thought it was very well prepared.
Came here by myself and the staff was very pleasant but not intrusive.
Nice atmosphere to sit outside.
2
I had a very disappointing meal as I ordered the savory crepes. Really didn't like the taste of it, maybe its me. But to play safe, order their sweet crepes.
5
Everything about the meal here was great. From the food, to the ambiance. The service was my favourite part and I truly enjoyed myself. Would recommend everyone to try it
4
Service was great and nice ambience for an early relaxing brunch!
Coffee was very bitter though. Had an americano and first time i had such a bitter strong americano!
4
Went with a total of 4 pax and ordered Food: 1. Dolce Vita; 2. Duck it!;3. Crab Avocado Maki;4. Scallopin; and 5. The 79(These were Galettes, which are a type savoury crepe) Alcohol:1. 1 Glass of "Rose Palm"; and 2. 1 Bottle of "Fournier BrutThe atmosphere was good and the service staff were very friendly. The staff was also very knowledgeable about the menu and recommended the wines which went very well with the food. Also, this restaurant was unique in that the alcohol is directly imported from France and kept in a temperature regulating storage units. Overall a very good experience
5
Great if you want a little diversions from the fabulous noodle options on the street. A good selection of savoury and sweet galettes/crepes (not going in to the difference here).A good selection of other options as well as drinks.Nice touch to the area and hope it remains
5
Definitely one of the best French restaurant in Singapore. It is usually not crowded even on weekends however I recommend you to book a table (using apps like Quandoo), you can also give them a call. I went there many times and the food and service never disappointed me. The crÃªpes and galettes taste absolutely fantastic and they have a good range of wine, beers, and ciders. This is the place to go if you're looking for a calm place with a great ambiance and delicious food
5
Very nice and pleasant place in the heart of Boat quay. Quick lunch with friends and great deserts. Great for lunch and eating outside, watching people passing by.A bit on a pricy side, but we are in Singapore, so no surprises there.Great staff, very nice and helpful. Just ask and they will get you set. Will be back there for sure
5
Service was excellent. Warm friendly and hospitable, thanks to the staff, Prem and Girlie.The galletes were great, we had the club salad, sea bass, the English breakfast gallete and burger with truffle fries. For dessert we ordered the salted caramel crepe.Loved the galletes and crepe. Coffee is abit weak and not as aromatic as id love it to be but the ambience, the warm service staff and the food made it a worthy trip.One of my fav places to be at and we will definitely return again
5
Nice dining experience at O comptoir with exceptional service by the crews. I liked the Duck it! crepe.
3
Had dinner there with family recently. Table outside on the road was great to observe the activity of the area. Service was very friendly. Truffle fries barely tasted of truffle. Ciders are ok. The bucklewheat galettes are ok. Nothing to rave about.
5
Being a vegetarian and still having options to choose from , was really good. The taste was very good and would definitely come back !
The atmosphere and the servers at the restaurant were very friendly too !
4
Walk in is possible during the earlier timing but reservations is best needed if you're coming in after 12pm. Love their savoury crepes - filling and good. Sweet crepes - although cheaper but plain looking. Good service.
5
Was offered the loan of an umbrella so I stayed to pass the rain. Helpful and friendly staff, good drinks menu, good happy hour. It's open on both sides and central. Great for friends, couples and work highly recommend.
5
Had a great time. Friendly service and good value food and drinks. It was busy and one dish must have gotten missed out from our order somehow. Upon asking about it, the staff were kind enough to quickly get the dish and insisted on not charging for it. Honestly I was very surprised at this commitment to service recovery, and am very impressed. It was above and beyond my personal expectation. Thank you to the team for always making it a great night. Loved the high fives too. :
4
We had two crepes, one with Nutella and the other with dark chocolate. The crepes were very good, not too sweet. The staff lady was nice and polite and made some suggestions (which we followed). We also tried the ciders, the rose and the apple one, and liked them as well
5
Wonderful afternoon spent with my wife in Singapore.The manager and the staff brought out smiles and great services to us. The recommendations and attention to details will make any meal here amazing with small or big group.Try the galettes and crepes here and Wednesday night looks good for a wine fiesta.The ambience won us over as we spent our hours here to chil
5
Shift manager Kid served us consistently well - making adjustments for preparation preferences, checking on us only at appropriate junctures and exchanging brief witty banter. The goat cheese crepe salad was healthy, substantial and delicious. We were in such a good mood after dessert we had the small glasses of champagne too. Well done guys!
3
Came back here for lunch again last week. Opted for one of the standard mains and had some iced water to wash it down. Didn't have to wait long and out it came, all quite tasty. Friendly and efficient service. Only criticism remains as with previous visits that I'm usually still a bit hungry afterwards.
4
Authentic ham and cheese savoury crepe together with old style butter sugar dessert crepe. Recommended!
5
Attentive service. good atmosphere for brunch with family. buckwheat crepes as good as you could hope for. surprisingly good coffee
3
Had the classic crepe just as a snack. A little chewy but overall texture was good. Will try other types next time
2
French? Ciders? Yes. But the food? Crisis. They offer these maki looking-curry flavoured galettes,for real? and it taste even funnier! The place-good. Staff singing to this funnycore. This is definitely fusion gone wrong, ha!
4
Ordered the brunch set & Menage 5. Enjoyed both dishes especially the handmade salted caramel crepe! Lady that attended to us was very hospitable too :)
5
wonderful service, made a reservation and got a nice table for 2 opposite a pink neon sign inside the shop which was pretty cool, great ambience and lighting, highly recommend for couples.started with a cider as recommended by my colleague - the waitress (who was good with the french names in the menu) quickly helped us pick something and we didnt even need to consult the menu.on to the food which was quite phenomenal for the price - we tried one savoury and one sweet crepe as suggested by the waitress - she was very helpful in explaining the nuances, food arrived on time and looked very neat. everything from temperature and crispness of the crepe to the flavours and taste (we wanted a cheesy crepe) was excellent. this applied to both the savoury and the sweet dessert crepe (with ice cream - wasnt too hot nor too cold). everything went smoothly and it was a fine evening for us setting the tone for a nice stroll down the promenade
4
It's a little strange seeing a place like O Comptoir in the back alley of Boat Quay. But a refreshing change. Drinks are not priced in line with the typical happy hour / big night out kind of prices offered by most bars in the area. But this place offers a good seating room, and very good music. Service staff is friendly. Def a must visit during a bar hopping trip in Boat Quay
4
Steak Tartare was good, Sea Bass was okay but Duck it is a must try! Though the dish kind of lacked some texture, it was seasoned very well!The service was awesome too! Great job to Grace and everyone at ÅŒ Comptoir! Will definitely be back for another duck it!
3
The food was ok but pretty average. The galette could use a bit more filling, sometimes there was more galette taste than anything else.Service was friendly and good. No complaints there.The place was pretty empty most of the evening which was strange because it was Saturday. We arrived at 7 and stayed until after midnight
5
Our first time visiting the restaurant. It was on a Saturday evening. The restaurant was almost 90% full but it's not noisy. The service from the waiters are good. They gave recommendation and the guy who attended the bar knows his stuff. He will recommend wine to pair with the food that you order.Price for the food are average and wine list is very reasonable. I would say is slightly cheaper than the average French and Italian restaurants. Food quality are good.We will definitely visit the restaurant again for weekend brunch
4
Had dinner with friends here. Really nice place with well trained and friendly staff. We had a savoury galette which was a bit too sour (tasted almost like a dosa/ thosai!) but the sweet crepe was great! Plenty of drink options which was also good.
5
The staff were very attentive and patiently explained the menu. Loved the restaurant setting and the food was good as well.
4
Go-to place for somewhere near work for a casual weekday catch up dinner. All items are affordable (below S$20 for mains) and rather filling, and it's easy to get a quick drink to unwind too. Not too noisy and staff while sometimes lean are friendly.
4
If you want to find good crepe, come over to this restaurant! I love their ciders as well. Ciders are directly imported from France!
5
Staff were very extremely friendly and considerate. Very relaxing and calming atmosphere. Food was great and worth for money. Drinks were alright as well. Very good in overall, will go there again.
5
Made reservation via Chope app which was very convenient and fuss-free. Throughout our dining experience, we were very well attended by the staff there, proactively offering to refill our water and also asking us for feedback on the taste of the food and any other requests. We had a 'Duck-it' and Caesar Salad crepe. The portion is generous and food-waiting time was unexpectedly short, which was a good surprise. I really like the Caesar Salad being piled on top of the buckwheat crepe; the savoury salad had leafy, juicy greens, crunchy chicken and toppings which was a great pairing with the buckwheat crepe that had a hint of natural sour taste. The ambience was amazing; warm fairy lights, quote on the wall by the famous playwright Oscar Wilde, light music and bar display...definitely coming back for another tasting for their sweet crepes
5
Third time going to o comptoir, the crepes are great (really like the one with salted caramel), the cider too and a real big thank you to the staff (especially Kid who is super professional,nice and fun). The service is good, quick and people super friendly! Loved the food, the drink, the place and will definitely come back soon!!!
5
O Comptoir, like its little brother (or sister) - O Batignoles is a great place for lunch or dinner in the area. Speciality is Crepes and they have introduced some surprising and bold recipes to integrate the best of this French speciality food and Asia. So appart from the usual suspects (eggs, ham, cheese, etc.) you can find some crepes like "Khao San Road" , "Seafood spirit" or Japanese inspired crepes which are all a great inspiration and wonderfully balanced. One very important great thing to notice about O Comptoir: the service. Whatever you ask, you always get a yes and a smile. I love it ! Congratulations to the whole team and see you again soon 
4
I stopped by last Friday around 6pm with my colleague and we had crepes and a couple of glasses of wine. The food was good and the wine reasonably priced but what truly stood out was the high standard of service. The staff seemed to genuinely care about making you happy. Highly recommend the place
4
My wife and I had a lunch date at this place and were pleasantly surprised with the options on the menu for vegetarians. Would recommend this to anyone looking for a good option near Boat Quay area. The Service was excellent and food was served in surprisingly quick time
3
Tried the galettes on my trip there. A bit too sour for our liking but the fillings were quite good. I had the Duck It! galette
4
The masala chicken buckwheat crepe is perfect with the chili 🌶 sauce. The service staffs were friendly and attentive.
5
Wife had the seabass, which was cooked to perfection.
Steak tartare was super authentic and a generous portion as well.
The wine was good and well priced for Singapore.
Need to go back for the crepes now, they looked super good as well!
4
I loved for the salted options in buckwheat, but for the sweets is flavor is sour. The staff is really good!!! I will return for sure, but I would like more options gluten free for sweets
5
I enjoyed the atmosphere of O Comptoir which offers a respite from the hustle and bustle of the Central Business District area all around it. Enjoy a bottle of Magnum wine while you're at it! Most of all, I appreciated the friendly and professional staff. In particular, I like to commend Chai Wen Xiang (Kid) for going the extra mile and making the company at our table feel special. Thank you for serving with a smile
5
We went as a school group of 15 students. Everyone was delighted with their food and the ambiance. We were warned that because it was a large group it might take some time but, in fact, the food service was very quick. Kid, our waiter, was charming and fun and really added to the evening. Thank you
5
O Comptoir is absolutely a must- I've been here many many times and will go again over and over again!The food is really incredible- beautiful ingredients, they source fantastic fresh and delicious ingredients for everything. I've tried many of their dishes and you really can't go wrong! Some favourites include their salmon salad galette, blue cheese ravioli (this is a lunch special so you're lucky if you are there on the right day!), truffle fries, and veggie diet galette. Plenty of super fresh and delicious healthy options. But everything they make is delicious. For dessert- the coco Chanel and ps I love you crepes are seriously amazing. The ambience is great, music is really good, and the service is out of this world.Can't say enough good things about the staff- everyone is super friendly, attentive, knowledgeable and on the ball with everything that's going on. Have never had a bad experience- you can be sure you'll be well looked after here. Best service staff I've come across in Singapore.Hands down my current favourite restaurant in Singapore. Definitely a fun place for drinks with friends, coffee and meetings, and romantic dinner :) enjoy! ❤️ thank you o comptoir for being so spectacular and standing out from the crowd
3
Lunch on a Sunday, slow, no crowd, great service, one of not many crepes locations around. Not being rushed makes it more relaxing, enjoy the food and what you are eating, allow conversations to flow, probably the taste makes this possible. Really enjoyed the ambience with the right food packaged together
5
O Comptoir have been really great in all aspects, from my initial enquires for a larger party (14 people) and the possible menu options, to ease of booking, to service on the day and fantastic food. Such great value for such fresh food and a great selection too. I will be a repeat customer and highly recommend
5
Great staff, great service, great food and great cider. I had a group booking of 7 for dinner on a Saturday night and the service was fantastic. all the food arrived at the same time (rare for Singapore!) and every order was correct. The sweet and savoury crepes are all delicious
5
Second time visiting. We find it a great value for money. Everything is very fresh and the service is very attentive.
4
They have a wide range of very yummy galettes and sweet crepes. the butter sugar lemon crepe and the salted caramel crepe is a must try. Good atmosphere and service.
5
My partner said the crepes is authentic, it reminds him of home.
Ask to be served by "Kid" yep, his name is Kid, he will bring you to another dining experience, in the most excellent way
4
The fermented batter gave a nice tang and bubbly texture to the crepe! Fillings were just right and not soggy. Service could be better and less ostentatious/pushy.
3
There were 8 of us. The waitress filled our glasses with only 1/4 cup of water (not sure why).. They then proceeded to serve half the table salad and the other half 20 minutes later. It was terrible.
4
O Comptoir helped me to organise my birthday (20 people) it was great, Communication was smooth and they were very helpfull before the event and During the Event. Great place to celebrate your birthday with your frends.
5
Went there for anniversary lunch and it was definitely a great experience! Food and service were great!
1
I had dined here before and recently went back to eat here, but the quality of the food has gone down. It feels as though the chefs had lost their passion in cooking. Very disappointed this time. On the plus side, the service staff is still as friendly. Though I doubt I'll be dining back here again in the future
5
My husband and I met friends here for lunch yesterday and had a great experience. Our waitress was very warm and attentive, ensuring we were well looked after during our lunch. The food was excellent, particularly the savoury galettes we had for our main courses. Myself and my friend both had the 'I Did It My Way', filled with goat cheese, pears, walnuts and honey. The sweet and savoury combo was perfect, the goat cheese with the honey and crispy walnuts the perfect balance of flavours and textures. I also managed to try a sweet crepe for dessert, with apples and salted caramel sauce, which was also delicious. The galettes and crepes were huge and stuffed with fillings, making for a very satisfying meal. We'll definitely be back again
5
We booked the O comptoir for a birthday celebration and we were very pleased with the service! I communicated with the team via email prior to the event and they were very responsive and accommodated all of my requests. The organization ran smoothly and it was easy for all the guests on the night of the event. Many thanks to the great team of O comptoir
5
Sunday lunch: Duck It! and Crab Me (off their special menu). Both were pretty good, hearty and filling. We received pleasant and attentive service. Indoor seating was comfortable and airy.
3
Located on cicular road corner, nice venue for drinks between friends in the happening backend of boat quay. Food quality is average between standard french crepes and a delicious steak tartar served with truffle french fries!
5
Thanks to the team, we had a great time at O Comptoir !
Great venue for a very convenient location. The food is great and the free flow formula was perfect for our birthday night ! Thanks again ! Best crêpes in Singapore !
4
A good place for french food and wine. the service staff were also good considering the place was packed.
5
Great location, charming building, Singaporian flatiron, casual friendly French atmosphere, very tasty French galettes, ..what else?
Clearly recommend to chill out and enjoy a piece of France in a lovely and charming environment.
4
Came back here yesterday for lunch and opted for the 79 crepe. Really very tasty. Efficient service, if a bit over the top in upselling additional products. The food is decent and it's worth another visit.
4
I often go there for lunch since I am working nearby. Their lunch set offers a salad and a nice crepe for a reasonable price. The service is just great and the crepes are very good. Not as good as in France but it is good and scarce enough to enjoy a perfect casual lunch. When I don't plan to be productive, I also order come cider and a salted caramel butter crepe for dessert
5
Went there for dinner and was really surprised by the awesome services they provide. They knew the menu well and asked for comments. The crepes went really well with the duck and the duck was juicy max! Ambience for the place was great and washroom is provided in it.
3
Service staff were excellent, very warm and friendly. Prompt service and eagerness to help made the evening lovely but food was pretty normal, nothing too exciting... We ordered 3 crepes (2 out of 3 were listed as recommended by Chope - Khao San Road, PS I Love You, and a Salad Crepe. The salad crepe came in a super generous serving, which was a surprise. We tried the ciders too. Ordered two glasses and felt that the portion given could have been more.
3
The galette pastry is very well done and the quantity of ingredients reasonable. Nevertheless i found it not flovored enought, maybe the quality of the ingredients?The crÃªpe pastry are also very good but the dosage of the sweetness from the intgredients is not well balanc
5
The food wasd very nice, the crèpes and galettes made me travel back to France. The service is great, and efficient. The atmosphere is relaxed and friendly! We had a really good time.
5
Great experience for authentic French crepes and wonderful ambience. Recommended for anyone who wants to have a great date.
4
Good bar with a fun crowd, serving decent drinks . Food snacks are also available . Atmosphere is good and you kinda sit outside on the street , so a good vibe. Very central
3
Came here today for lunch with a friend and chose one of the specialty crepes with prosciutto and cheese. The food was decent, service efficient. Still felt a little hungry afterwards but otherwise no complaints.
5
By far the BEST and EXCELLENT ambience, food and FABULOUS SERVICE in Boat Quay area! Creative menu of crepes, generous portion with ciders/wine at great value! Cosy setting and not noisy at all. I went back twice in two weeks and will defo go back again!
4
Headed down during a Monday lunch and it was pretty quiet initially, although the restaurant began to fill up in the late afternoon.The outdoor seating is well-ventilated with fans (important in Singapore!) and the vibes are excellent - music was pretty jazzy and I almost felt like I was back in Paris.The galettes! That's what you come here for. Yes, I've definitely had better in Paris but honestly if you're looking for galettes in Singapore, I doubt you'd be able to find anything more authentic than this. Very reasonably priced as well. They also have a good selection of apple cider (I miss this from the French crÃªperies) and wines. And the service was excellent. Prompt and friendly, I'd say it's at the very least above average.Will definitely be back
5
I was really impressed with the service standards at O' Comptoir! The service staff made me and my family feel really comfortable, and at home. They were friendly and approachable. As to the food, you have to try the truffle fries because it is truly one of the best truffle fries I've ever eaten
5
Thank you to the O Comptoir team for hosting my fabulous lunch party! Food was just as fantastic as every other time I've been to O Comptoir. You consistency in food & service is what brings us back time and time again. Thanks for being flexible in your offerings for my party..everyone had a blast. :) Ciao, GQP 
4
My family and I had a good experience at the restaurant. We liked the food and had the Galette dish mainly. Portion is huge and can feed 2 hungry adults. The cider served in the traditional 'bolee' glass also adds a different touch to the dining experience
4
O Comptoir is a surprisingly authentic creperie located in a busy district of Singapore. It offers a rich selection of sweet and salty crepes at reasonable prices.Pros:-Good mix of creative and traditional crepes-Relaxed setting-Selection of imported cidersCons:-Relatively limited choice of traditional "brasserie" dishes - although the steak tartare was quite goo
4
The premises are bright and airy, and the service is great. The four of us ordered the set menu for $32 which included a crepe, 3 drinks, and a pastry/yoghurt. All in all a great spot for brunch.
5
Nice, cozy place a short walk from Raffles place mrt. Serves excellent crepes and galettes. Loved the menage a 5 galette (emmental cheese, ham, tomato, mushrooms and egg). Service was great too. Perfect place for a Sunday brunch.
5
I am a regular at this place for their good French wine selection at very affordable prices (for Singapore standards). Service is always great, staff is attentive and the vibe is relaxed yet classy, unlike most of the other bars on the same road.
4
The place is walking distance from Raffles mrt (Singapore's red line).
They have great varieties of crepes & wines. We had a great time together as we had celebrated the birthday of our friend's dad☺️👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
4
Lovely restaurant with both indoor and outdoor seating. Very friendly staff and good service and the food came very quickly. We had the "Mustard day" galletes and one "goat cheese salad in a wrap". Tasted good and fresh, could have been more salt though. Great place!
5
After eating the worst asian food ever on Tioman and Perenthians for a week, we arrived in Singapore with empty stomach. Even with our backpacker look, waiters took care of us like if we were prince and princess. We tried a sweet crÃªpe and a bottle of cider. Everything was delicious, cider is even better that the one we are used to drink in France and the caramel is just fantasticThanks for this moment.
5
My highlight about this place is on the staff, most definitely. I would go to the other outlet, Obatignoles for a nice, sit down meal, but i love the staffs in Ocomptoir. They are bubbly and it suits the cosy-fun ambience. You can see that people are comfortable being there, and they seemed to have quite a few regulars. They have an array of cider selection which is awesome
5
Booked a table for 2 on a Friday night and it was one of the best experiences I've had! Got the swing by the window and the service was simply splendid. They allowed me to taste the wine before I made my order, and even after I left when I called them back, they remembered who I was! :) will def be back. Oh not to mention, the food was lovely!
4
I was craving crepes for breakfast and this place did not disappoint. My 4yo loved the chocolate and banana crepe and I loved the salted caramel and apple. My only criticism was the salted caramel tasted a little burnt, but I hope it was just that batch. I'll be come back to try it again. I'd also recommend the grenadine syrup - a perfect drink to have with a crepe. (it was too early for cider
4
After waiting way too long, I finally gave O Comptoir a shot. It didn't disappoint, though at a recent lunchtime, the place was full of tai-tai women - or women who lunch. Lunchtime is still the best time to go, as Circular Rd tends to get quite sleazy in the evenings. Had a sensibly-priced lunch set (about $17) - for a good garden salad and an excellent crepe called the mustard day. Tried a couple of other crepes including a dessert one with maple syrup - all excellent stuf
4
Lovely French crepes with an extensive menu. Definitely a change from your usual dining menu. The bar & restaurant has a great ambiance on a Friday evening - fab music, great location and good selection of drinks.
4
Good choices of set lunch. Nice French galette. Good cider. Bright place. Would be nice if set dot dinner
5
If you're looking to eat french crepes without going all the way to France, try O'Comptoir. Easy to locate, high service standards and pleasant atmosphere. Decent food quality with a decent price tag (SGD 10+ to 20+ depending on what you order)
4
Great place for French Crepes!
The location is convenient, the service is courteous and attentive, and the food is fantastic. It is a great relaxing place for meetups and gatherings with friends and family. Highly recommended.
5
Loved the service and how they made sure that everything great for us and we are served.
Something that is a basic thing but somehow is widely lacking in Singapore, except this spot.
5
If you are looking to have French crepes in Singapore, go to O Comptoir! There is a wide range of crepes in the menu to choose from. Whether you like it sweet or savory, pair it with a glass of cider to complete your meal! Love the service there too, the friendly and attentive staff makes the environment a homely and cosy place to dine in
4
Came here for lunch this week with a friend and opted for one of the crepe lunch sets at $17++. The food was really very tasty but the serving was a bit small: I was still hungry afterwards and needed to supplement with something else later. It's still worth a visit, but the lunch sets are a bit small
4
Its often seems to be pretty hard to find a decent place that cooks Eggs Benedict without the Eggs being an undercooked mess so find this place was a nice surprise. The breakfast was cooked perfectly and instead of salmon or cheap ham they instead used prosciutto which was a good change. The coffee was very average and just came from a basic machine however the cider selection was great and also very cheap which made up for it
5
Held my birthday party here at O Comptoir last Friday as I've always liked the ambience, quality of staff and affordable drinks. I was in correspondence with the events manager, Aliff, for two weeks before the event. He was always quick to respond and very helpful in suggesting alternatives to consider for the party package. Settled on a 2 hour free-flow event for 25 guests and on the day itself it was extremely well executed. My guests did not have to wait to be tagged (in fact we were late to the venue by an hour and the staff were very accommodating, holding our tables etc.) or for our drinks even when the rest of the bar was at full capacity. We were taken very good care of by one of the senior staff - Kid, who checked on each table periodically to make sure that everyone had enough to drink or didn't need anything else
4
Laid back place with good staff, decent menu, tasty food. We had dinner here recently, and had savoury crepes for main, along with a crispy salad, and sweet crepes for desserts. All tasted really good, freshly made, and unique. The staff were very efficient, friendly and a rarity, they actually smiled! Would recommend this place
5
Expect nothing less, this place is packed With great food, great servers and excellent priced wine. It's a great place especially for gathering , servers are very helpful and they are attentive to your needs- even ice water!
5
I was craving French food and I was not disappointed. The Crepes are really authentic! I will definately come back again and take a cider glass with that!
4
While wandering through Roberson Quay, stopped in for a quick drink. Nice wine list, good atmosphere and service. Looked like nice light bar menu as well. Can't wait to go back.
5
Tasty and authentic galettes in a nice atmosphere and with good service. My second visit - I'm glad I went back and i will go again.
5
Great food , friendly staff, the pricing is good for Singapore. I came twice, both times happy with food and service. Try the gazpacho if it's in season. It's off the hook.
5
First time held a small team event here. Service is excellent prior event date with good recommendation to fit the team night. On event day, the serving crew is awesome. They are very helpful and friendly. Excellent service rendered thru out the night. For sure, we had a great night and this is one of the best place for gathering. Thanks to everyone especially Aliff and Kid
5
Had a small event and it was well handled.....From marketing staff to outlet manager and service staff - all was great.We had a great night and everyone complimenting great crepes, great place and great staff.Thanks to everyone who had made our event great! (Aliff, Nicholas and Kid

When a friend asked me to meet him at circular road for crepes and galettes, I was scratching my head a little. Crepes on circular road? Turns out it's one of those bars I've walked passed before but that also serves "real" food. And the location is quite prominent, right at the intersection of circular road and a smaller road. We came for brunch (yes, a "bar" that opens for brunch) and I tried the mÃ©nage a cinq, a mixture of fried egg, mushroom, ham, tomatoes and emmental cheese wrapped in a buckwheat crepe (galette). At $16, it wasn't overly expensive and was actually quite filling. Service staff was polite but the food took a bit of time to arrive. Would I go back? Yes. I'd like to try their regular crepes as well as their sweet crepes. Ah, if only they offer takeaways. I can imagine walking down the street in a Nutella and banana crepe
4
We went to O Comptoir for a special occasion with friends and family. We were very satisfied. Food was tasty and simple - as we wanted to. All our guests were happy with it. The staff was reactive: one of the waitress was fully dedicated to us and was running around the whole night, always with a smile, to serve us. Last but not least, management was accommodating by finding an inside large table inspite of the rain.Overall they showed flexibility for such a large table (17 pax). O Comptoir definitely matched our expectations. We'll come back there, definitely
4
Just left the restaurant after a nice catch up dinner with friends. Market under the entertainer application we ordered 2 mains and got 2 free.We got seated outside and the waiter was very friendly and funny - he made us feel welcome and also didn't mind repeating a few times the same thing to us. We ordered 4 crepes and they arrived very quickly - we were with a French who rated the Crepe 79 very very good. And I agree.Ambient is lively with music but still perfect to talk.Most definitely we will be back.Thanks
5
Very nice galettes and crepes. Pleasant environment that suggests Brittany. Need to go back in the evening to have a few ciders.
5
relaxed atmosphere, friendly staff, cold beer. A bit quiet because of Christmas holidays. Recommend to come here for a drink
4
We've sent the wine back twice - the rose tasted bizarre! The crepes and the burgers were yummy and delicious though.
2
Not worthy, far too expensive for such a food and the service is too long. And I know French cuisine, I am French!

Reserved a nice table for us that came with a swing. Staff were very friendly & attentive, coming by twice to check on the food. Would be great if the place was air conditioned though as the afternoon sun (and haze) was rather unbearable.

We visited this restaurant one Saturday evening for dinner and it was a superb dining experience...from food, wine and definitely the service. The manager named Girlie was so welcoming, accommodating and attentive in getting and delivering our orders and even gave us recommendations on the 'must try' in the menu. We didnt wait for long for our food and drinks as she was so alert and attentive to us and to other customers with a smile which made our dining experience even better. Keep up the good job guys

If you are looking for something different for brunch during the weekend, this is a lovely little place on the corner of Circular Road and Lorong Telok.We sat outside on the shaded terrace. The brunch set ($32) gets you orange juice, a savoury crepe, a sweet crepe and 2 hots drinks served at the beginning of the meal and at the end. You get to customize your savoury crepe too. I chose a ham and mushroom buckwheat galette which was served with a runny egg. We didn't want to eat too much so the hubby ordered the 79 crepe (cheese, bacon, caramelized onions and bacon) and asked for 2 coffees (from the brunch set ) to be served at the end). Both crepes were delicious. For dessert, we had the sugar crepe which was lovely too.It was great to enjoy the charm of boat quay on a quiet Saturday morning. Our server Grace Ann was friendly and efficient - as far as I could tell she was the only one taking care of the tables on the terrace. We never felt neglected nor rushed.Will definitely be back!

I was looking for somewhere to quietly sit and do some work while enjoying a cheeky beverage and was stoked with this corner joint. Awesome cider list (which is a complement coming from Aus, we have a few classics!) and equally awesome staff who made me feel super welcome and always were there for a chat. To put it into perspective I came for a drink and left 3 hours later... Get into it and enjoy!

I come here whenever I am free on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon for brunch. My personal recommendation for brunch food would be the egg benedict. Le Comptoir's egg benedict is well cooked, their eggs are prepared to perfection, the toast is made by themselves which is truly unique. Every bite of the toast with salmon, yolk and hollandaise sauce screams perfection. Other food I would recommend would be Marinated Salmon with Scrambled Eggs and their crepes. The pricing is reasonable for the Boat Quay area (for one person, I never spend more than $40.00 including drinks). The staff are friendly and attentive, always coming by to check on our food and if we need anything more. My only complain is the standard of the tables. While inside seating is reasonable, their outside tables are all shaky, even when I try to remedy with coasters at the legs, it still shakes. Besides that, there is no reason not to like this restaurant

We organized a monthly, networking drink at Le Comptoir for around 70 people. The staff was very good by offering quick service. Atmosphere was great and people liked it that the Circular Road is closed for cars during the evening on Fridays and Saturdays.

A mate and I went to Le Comptoir this evening for a couple of drinks.
A bit off the beaten track in Clarke Quay, this place doesn't disappoint.
Great cocktails, cool crepes and outstanding service.
Highly recommended.

Love this little gem hidden behind boat quay. It serves up great easy meals and has a nice selection of beers and wines. We stumbled across this one at lunch time and loved the ambience. Love the crepes!

This is a great restaurant. The crepes are really authentic and delicious, the desert is yummy too. The design / deco is very cool and the staff are professional.

O'Comptoir occupies a great space on a busy corner of Circular Road. There is a mix of indoor and outdoor seating. They are open for lunch and dinner: at lunch there is a good value set menu and the galettes and pancakes are available all day. Their drinks prices are quite reasonable and on Wednesdays if a group of 4 ladies book a table after 7pm you'll get a free bottle of RosÃ¨. Can't beat that

I have been to Le Comptoir around four times and their crepes are really tasty and filling. Their wide variety of savory and dessert crepes give options for seafood, vegetarian and meat eaters. My personal favorite dessert crepe is the Normandy Landing which is their salted caramel butter and I usually pair this with demi sec apple cider.

The ambience is very good. The decor and the lighting are just nice. The restaurant has a nice table with a swing set, which adds to the charm.The associates are friendly and quick to serve/assist. The selection are very good. My two friends and I ordered three different crepes namely The 79, Cheese Ambition and Seafood Spirit. And we ended up ordering an extra The 79. We believe it's the best among the selection!Since we made our reservation via Chope.com which has current promotion with Le Comptoir (for the month of February only) that would give complimentary sweet crepe. My friends and I were expecting that we would only get one serving of Sweet Crepe but in the end we each had one! The dessert was simply good. I would definitely go back and try their other crepes.

I have been to Singapore so many times and have been to Boat Quay a number of times. But I had missed this back street behind it, lined with a number of bars and reasonably priced restaurants. So Le Comptoir is a trendy bar in the middle section of the street, and it was nearly deserted on the Saturday evening around 8 pm when I visited. Just had a glass of wine here. The waiter said this place is in business under this name for the past 9 months. It is busy on Wednesdays and Fridays because of the young office crowd. On weekends people shop and spend time with families. So if you are a visitor, you can either avoid Wednesday's and Fridays if you don't like crowd and music or the opposite.

It could be that I spent the previous few weeks in SE Asia where there is a lack of decent wine to say the least, but I was so happy to step into this place. I got a mix crepe plate which 4 different cheeses and a glass of Chote de Rhoune for $30 in total. Staff were very friendly, and the service was everything you would expect at a French eaterie. Decent funky house music and low level lighting created a great relaxing ambiance
