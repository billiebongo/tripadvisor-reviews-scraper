Affordable and good small cafe. More on European food. Staff are accommodating and efficient. $7 meals on Wednesday promo.

This place is just in the ground floor of our hotel, Peninsula Excelsior. We ordered dessert, blue berry cheese cake and black forest cake. both were delicious.

For the person on-the-go, there is a decent variety of sweets and savouries to choose from. And the coffee isnt bad. The location is just a tad dull.

Considering Singapore is an international city for business etc. I am amazed at how little English is underatood in many businesses out of China Town. This coffee shop is at the base of a large hotel. I ordered 2 Ice Coffees with my best slow Australian accent but this still wasnt understood and I was given eye rolls until it got through. I would have walked out only we had walked all day and were looking forward to sitting down and having a cool drink. Better value for an iced coffee around the corner at Sidewalk Food. They also have little English but cater to the locals and are very friendly to tourists

A small corner coffee shop / cafe on Coleman Street attached to the Peninsula part of the Peninsula-Excelsior Hotel. Had a mid-afternoon Latte and slice of Strawberry Cheesecake here whilst staying at the hotel and it was very good. Better than a Starbucks! Costs were average for this kind of establishment, Latte was SG$5.60 and the Cheesecake was SG$5.90 (about GBÂ£6.75) and service was efficient
5
Whilst staying in the attached hotel found this coffee bar offering a good range of morning light meals and much more importantly proper breakfast tea. We chose scrambled egg on toast which was freshly prepared and served very quickly. There was also a good range of pastries muffins etc to tempt but I was a good boy.Called in later in the day for a refreshing cuppa before heading for the airport

Spinelli Coffee Company is located in Coleman Street beside the lobby of Peninsula Excelsior Hotel. Depending on the day of the week it opens between 8 and 9am and closes between 8-10pm. It serves good tasting coffee, teas, iced based beverages and other drinks. They also have wraps, sandwiches, cakes and muffins. This was a great place to take a break each day from our tourist activities

The food and coffee was not bad but NOT what I ordered and when it came out, I realized... instead of trying to fix the problem, I received dirty looks by the staff. I guess the small chicken salad can easily be mistaken for their deluxe mealsAll in all it could be worse I just wished they could own up to their mistake and apologize as oppose to making me feel the way they did.Food & drink: 1 point / Service: - 
5
Located directly under the Peninsula excelsior this little hidden gem has some incredible food and iced tea. The chicken puffs and the wraps are absolutely delicious. I would recomend the food here over the food that the above hotel serves every day of the week. Food comes quick and the service is grea

For a tourist finding a good cup of coffee in Singapore can present a challenge. We have had a few disasters most of them undrinkable. But this little place is a winner. A real cup of coffee..what a relief. It is a coffee shop setup offering a variety of snacks at reasonable prices..sometimes a welcome change from the Asian food on offer everywhere. If you want a break from noodles and all the rest or if you just need a good coffee this is the place. 
4
Stopped off a couple of times here when we only wanted something light. Good range of snacks and great fruit smoothies.
5
Great coffee, we had afternoon tea, supper & breakfast at this mid-priced, affordable café - would visit again if in Singapore.
4
This cofffee shop have good coffee, cold sandwiches however their hot food items are not the best and would recommend going to an actual shop if you are really hungry.
4
Located at Peninsula Tower. Cake was so delicious. I love cheese cake. But there was some chairs so in Spinelli, it can't accommodate for many people.
4
Food and coffee very good quality. Actually, coffee can be excellent. Service good and outlet very clean
5
I regularly hang out with my friend to have a nice coffee and chit chat or serious discussions. Place is nice and quiet and staffs are friendly. They know what I am going to order depend on the times that I visited the cafe.
4
Convenient, comfortable seating, and not too crowded muchnof the day. Small range of cabinet food, but some good items and acceptable coffee though not cheap even for Singapore. GLuten free Chocolate cake delicious..little dry. Iced yuzu tea cake excellent.
5
I was staying at the adjoining hotel and my room did not include breakfast, this great little café has excellent breakfast options at very reasonable prices. Good coffee.
5
good coffe and also good choices for breakfast. Everything was very tasty and the staff is also nice. I would come again :-)
3
Of the major coffee chains in Singapore I occasionally choose to visit Spinelli, which I feel offers marginally better coffee. But really you're much better off making the effort to explore some of Singapore's growing selection of specialty cafes and coffee outlets. Spinelli is an acceptable compromise if you're in a place with limited alternatives.
4
This was a good place for a quick breakfast. Good coffee and also there is good snacks or lunch options too.
4
Had their fruitti berry smoothie and honey mustard tuna sandwich which taste good! Would be likely to visit again in the future.
4
Breakfast is good and well priced with a reasonable range. Certainly cheaper than the Peninsula Excelsior Hotel, Coffee is OK, Twisties ( juice drinks) are good.
5
Have had breakfast many times as its below the hotel I stay at. Coffee and food is good value. Service always friendly
5
Very nice and handy location as it was just outside the hotel. The coffee was good & the food was good as well, they have a variety of food & pastries.

Little Coffee place at the entry of the Peninsular Excelsior - I was told to check on their sweets and also on a diet, took the blueberry cheese cake. A very wonderful flavor and utterly tasty. Of course place is not fancy (almost like all the today's coffee/starbucks style places) but friendly staff, pretty efficient (Singapore staff typically work slow and peaceful so I was impressed how fast the little girl was managing our over the counter orders). If you love sweets, go ther

Im a coffee addict and sometimes its hard to find a good capuccino or latte in Singapore.This is the place if you are staying near St Andrews Church or Peninsula Plaza.Great coffee, clean, great barrista not outrageously expensive.Just the place for me.Go there

This review is for the owner. If I owned this place I would want my customers to tell me straight. It is Sunday morning May 15 at 11 as I write . There are two girls working here. One is small who is really nice and helpful and hygienic. A great employee and cares about her customers. And I imagine cares about her boss. The big girl just does not want to be here. She does not care. She is abrupt when you ask questions to the point of rudeness making it tough to make choices from the menu. I really did not want to stay but needed to eat. If she was my employee I suggest she find a job where no customer interface necessary. I like your Cafes but wish your coffee was stronger. A triple shot is not the answer!! Choice of beans is critical. I know coffee preferences vary world wide but even France is changing after a few more French travel and discover a better coffee world. But nice caf

Staying in a nearby hotel, on an "all meals extra" basis, which was 100% OK, but it meant we needed somewhere for breakfast. The hotel was not too expensive for a full cooked breakfast, but when all you want is coffee and a light bite, somewhere else is the answer. We popped in here - a good sized mug of OUTSTANDING coffee (OK maybe I am a little biased as first thing in the morning, especially after a poor night's sleep (jet lag, not booze!), I need a good coffee to kick start the old brain cells). Great value in scrambled eggs on toast and a croquet monsieur sandwich. Breakfast for 2 in Singapore for less than Singapore$ 17? WOW. It was so good we used it several times! HGMLWell worth a visit

This is a small walk-up cafe on the ground floor of the Peninsula-Excelsior hotel, right near the bell hops. they have small sandwiches and some nice desserts here and lots of hot and cold drinks. it's not cheap, but the workers are very nice and helpful.
4
Good value, coffee good and a range of reasonable western style breakfast options. Close to central amenities and ground floor of Peninsula Excelsior Hotel
3
Just out side the Peninsula hotel main lobby. Pleasant place to chill and have a cup of coffee/tea, while you wait for your taxi to the airport. Service was good, fair menu and clean.
4
drinks and foods is good but a bit expensive than other franchise. I like this cafe which they have AMEX promition right now...
4
Best for Fresh Healthy Food Not a very large menu but all good things worth trying Moderately priced
4
Stayed at the Peninsula Excelsior Hotel next door and used this place for getting coffee in the morning and/or snacks during the day (loved the muffin!). Friendly staff, good quality of drinks/food.
5
A great little coffee shop on Coleman street
Great place to drop into for a cake and a quick coffee during the afternoon
4
Great place for a quick coffee and cake handy if your staying in one of the hotels on Coleman street good hot chocolate
4
Small cafe. Good choice. Reasonable cost. Good food. Bacon and eggs for hubby - muffins and coffee - toast. Great coffee.
3
This is a quite nice little coffee shop tucked away in Coleman st. Chef Salad was great for Gluten Free diet. My husband enjoyed toasted chicken sandwiches, we dropped in frequently for light lunches during a two week stay.

Spinelli is a café at street level right next to the Peninsula Excelsior Hotel. While the Coleman Café at the hotel serves a good buffet breakfast, personally, I don't always want that sort or quantity of food in the morning. Spinelli is an excellent alternative venue for breakfast. Staff is pleasant and there is amply choice from which to chose.If just cereal and coffee, or a muffin and coffee is all that needed for breakfast, here it's easy to have just that, not have to pay too much and slip away fairly quickly afterwards. Having said that, I recall one morning a gentleman started a conversation with me about about the history and politics of Singapore and an hour later I excused myself. Nevertheless, it was an enjoyable way to start the day talking with one of the local characters - and, of course, I learned a few things, too.The eatery is very popular and certainly worth a visit.I'll definitely go back when next in Singapore
4
Meals were simple and inexpensive. Breakfast was good.
The place is always busy which speaks for itself.
3
The food looked good, but don't ask for what they advertise is in the sandwich, lettuce and tomato cost more than the advertised price because "it's an old ticket" - then when I asked for the extras, they didn't put them in.
4
If staying at the Penisular Excellsior hotel its a great place to coffee either on way out or way in - or both :)
Good coffee and snacks - but not cheap...
5
As Spinellis was next door to our hotel we went there for coffee and cake very often, the staff were great were very helpfull and friendly would recommend this place even for lunch or dinner a just go place to visit
5
We have afternoon coffee and apple cake.
The coffee is good, the cake was excellent.
Specifically we liked the service, it is not too common is such places to get such excellent service.
4
The coffee was a bit strong for me but nothing wrong with the tea. The food was fantastic. Quick and well priced. Great place to grab a meal or snack
4
Good cafe just beside the Peninsula Excelsior Hotel, Singapore. Good place for coffee, brekkie & lunch.
3
Taste and temperature fluctuated. Staff friendly and helpful.
Free WiFi is great as the hotel above doesn't have it.
5
this place was at the base of our hotel ,It was good coffee friendly service.
good for a quick coffee or tea at a good price .
4
We stayed at the Peninsula Excelsior for a number of days and instead of getting robbed by their breakfast prices, we went downstairs for breakfastâ€“my family of five ate meals totalling just over the price of one breakfast at the hotel, and it was good! Coffee was good, the breakfast sandwiches were good and my wife really loved her granola and yoghurt. Good job
