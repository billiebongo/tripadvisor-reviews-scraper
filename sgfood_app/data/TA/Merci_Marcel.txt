We went for brunch. Good food. Good services. Simple food but good quality ingredient makes this place successful.
Raviolis and pain au chocolat were the best!
We will come back!

Excited to try this new French cafe in our neighbourhood and decided to dine there tonight. Somehow we are not impressed with the food.

I did an online reservation and got seated in the bar with my girlfriend which is fine but bit surprised so if that is an issue for you confirm it before.The overall atmosphere and location being near to home will make me go again and I am hoping to have an better experience with lessons learned. The beef was very good but already mixed with a delicious mushroom sauce. Scallops main was good but way to small. Asparagus with sea salt must have taken a swim in the ocean before and was not the best picked produce/quality.Weighing in price and our experience makes it a 3 but it so close to 4 rating. Until next time bonne apetit

Beautiful cafe with a lovely ambiance. The service was quick and the staff were friendly. Too many questions asked by too many staff back to back with regards to the food Served etc, However I’m sure it is simply to gain feedback and opinions from customers. Will definitely be back again!

Went with my husband and another couple. Beautiful decor and location with decent price/quality French wines by Singapore standards - much like their sister restaurant O’bagtinolle. We loved it on first impressions as we had our first drink. Unfortunately, food was terrible. We had the duck rillette, crab rillette, cheese croquette, handcut chips with truffle oil, mushroom side, asparagus, steak and chicken. The only nice item was the duck rillette. The cheese croquette was really a potato croquette. We couldn’t taste the Comte. Steak was so-so. The mushroom looked like it came out of a tin and cooked into a creamy mush. Steak was not worth $46 and chicken was mediocre. Service was unnatural and inexperienced. We would go back only for a bottle of wine. Not a dinner place.

This French cafe offers such a great food w/ a good service. The Ambience is nice & cozy. Music is just right, not too loud. We came here for breakfast on Friday morning. The crowd starts at 10.00 so come early if u like it quiet or come around 11.00 if u love d lively ambience^^ The scramble eggs w/ truffles was very nice. Hot americano is also good, not too strong. My husband’s Croque Marcel looked inviting w/ a lovely sunny side up fried egg. Daytime Menu starts at 11.00, make sure u make a reservation on weekend visit. Staffs are so lovely and attentive. Definitely come back again

That's the way a cozy coffee with a croissant has to be in the morning. A quiet atmosphere with good background music. Not as crowded and noisy as the well-known Tiong Bahru Bakery next door. Very nice service and free Wifi (which is probably also appreciated by the guests next door ;)

Was there for a late lunch with the wife. Shared the Caesar salad, saucisson, truffle scrambled eggs, platter of 3 soft cheeses and a glass of French cider. Recommend the cheese and cider, and the standout for me was the great service. When we first sat down there was a nice introduction that they only recently opened for business and the server explained the menu well. We also requested to move tables (without getting any frowns) as we ran out of table space with the food ordered. The server also had the initiative to offer to slice the saucisson for us without prompting

Loving the overall aesthetic a bright setting in the day and bar in the night. Went for my first visit 2 weeks back and the fresh toast is awesome!! The coffee is deeply roast which isn't my kind but overall, great experience and I'll definitely revisit ;

Absolutely stunning food & service from the crew of Merci Marcel .Situated just in the heart of Tiong Bahru , this bistro exudes tinge of french vibes with lotsa coziness . From the perfectly curated cheese platter to the buttery croissant and the generous scattered almonds flakes, with a tangy summer berries french toast , everything was perfectly executed.! Though the queue was long , but the amazing service and food has made the wait worth it . Will definitely be back to try the dinner men
