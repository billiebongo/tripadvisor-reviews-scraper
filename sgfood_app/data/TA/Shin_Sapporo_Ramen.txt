Visited the outlet at Orchard Gateway near Somerset mrt and opted for the lunch set with Miso ramen, 3 pieces of gyoza and some green tea at $10.80++. Service was abrupt but efficient, although the restaurant was virtually empty. The ramen was nothing special but the gyoza was reasonable. There are definitely better options for ramen

Piping hot bowls of ramen topped with half a hard boiled egg with runny yolk and paper thin slices of melt-in-the-mouth Japanese style pork chashu can be had from as little as S$13.80++ (US$10 before service & tax) at Shin Sapporo ramen. Diners have a choice of the type of ramen and a choice of soup base from miso broth, shoyu broth, tonkotsu broth, seafood based broth, wakame or seafood based broth or pork bone broth. There is a small selection of donburi - bowls of Japanese rice with various toppings and side dishes such as chicken teriyaki, gyoza, grilled mackerel etc for those who wish to have more dishes to go with their mains. Service used to be more attentive, but declining service standards seem to be quite commin in casual dining establishments, department stores and standalone retail outlets in Singapore in recent years

Having just arrived back at the hotel after a 10hr working day, its nice to be able to walk across the street and find this place. Service is very quick, I barely had time to look this place up before my food arrived.I ordered the Miso pork flavoured special thick noodles. Oh how I wish I had walked in here last week when I was feeling crummy, this was delicious comfort food! I enjoyed the thick broth and the egg, and of course the noodles, which they served al dente. I am not a big eater so about half the noodles remained after I was finished eating, so the serving size would suit a guy. This place would suit someone looking to stay close to the hotel (Conrad) and doesn't have time to sit around, may have finished work late and bit hungry..

Tried their Orchard Gateway outlet and had a Shio Ramen. I know Shio is supposed to be a light salted broth but the ingredients were "light" too: 2 slices of pork, a piece of sea weed, half an egg, pickles and some veges. $13.80 with service charge and GST came up to $16.24. Doesn't feel like a satisfying meal.

I believe this is the location that is right across the street from the Conrad Centennial, which is where I stayed.As someone who is genetically predisposed to understand the subtle flavorings of ramen ... I can assure you that it is very good. Either that or I was extremely hungry at the time.Dining area is very small. Servers do speak Japanese. I had the miso tonkotsu ramen with shiso gyoza and a mug of Sapporo nama beer, which all told cost me $33. A bit on the expensive side in my opinion, but compared to cost of eating at the hotel restaurant it is not bad. It started to close around 9:40pm.Suggest eating here if you are staying at the Conrad and want a quick meal before heading off to the lobby bar and listening to the piano player sing

During summer or even late spring, it is common for ramen-ya in Japan to churn out cold noodles in a bid to draw customers who are sweating profusely under hot temperatures of 36-37 degrees. Thanks to the air-conditioners in Singapore, I have hardly spotted any of such cold ramen around but I'm glad Shin Sapporo has pioneered a truly refreshing bowl called " Tenchirashi Ramen" $15.80 that are served with tempura mushrooms and prawns. The room-temperature thin noodles were not as chilled as expected, but slurps down the throat easily thanks to the poached egg that congeals everything together. Saved from the dousing of hot broth, the noodles preserved the touch of al dente and the flavours emerging from the transparent dashi sauce were clean and subtly sweet. Ebi Tofu ($6.80)-- two square cold beancurd topped with bouncy shrimps and greens, served as a very light and healthy appetizer or side dish to share, though the peanut dressing was slightly murky. So I prefer the sizzling Miso Tofu Steak ($6.80) on hot plate as the homemade miso paste were more punchy. Plus, who could have expected some tantalizing deep-fried potato slices at the base?Miso broth tends to be more intense in the umami factor than shoyu broth and these two bowls of ramen are no exception. The Wakayama Tonkotsu Shoyu ($14.80) pairs straight-thin noodles with a well-balanced seafood and pork broth while the Shin-Sapporo Kara Miso Ramen ($14.80) marries an orangey miso stock with thick-curly noodles. That's what I call attention to details, for not every matchmaking session between the noodles and the broth turn out well.  I am not a fan of cloyingly rich broth, but somehow I find that both bowls were easier to manage than those I've had in Japan, though I wished the broths were served piping hot and the roast pork bellies could bulk up more meat.

I find a lot of ramen shops to have over-salted broth. I've had the mini lunch set twice in Tampines location and have tried a shoyu and kara-tonkotsu bowls along with their gyozas and Menchi - an original and well-seasoned dish of fluffy, tender pork mince. I even enjoyed the accompanying cabbage salads. Everything in this chain restaurant seems to be appropriately seasoned. Free ice cream with Facebook like on my latest visit FTW. Chilli ramen next time. Soon.

Was here a number of times and I believe that they served pretty good ramen here.The restaurant is small and I would estimate that it could only accomodate maybe 15-20 guest at one time. It has an open kitchen concept which is common among ramen restaurant. Restaurant is simply furnished an tables close together which is a pity. I can literally here what the patrons beside our table were speaking.No frills ramen and service. Simple an nice and the price is pretty standard for a bowl of ramen in Singapore, which is between 12-18 sing dollars a bowl. The broth is tasty and flavorful. Maybe a 7-8 out of ten
