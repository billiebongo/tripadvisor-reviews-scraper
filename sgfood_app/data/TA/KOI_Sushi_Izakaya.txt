When looking for a good healthy meal I often think of Japanese food. Izakaya restaurant served a nice array of food with good miso and refills of green tea. The service was excellent and it was a good experience.

MY BEST SUSHI EXPERIENCE EVER..!!!Personally i love eating sushi and have always been on a lookout for great sushi joints. This restaurant has brought my expectations to a whole new level with their mouth watering SALMON ABURI..! Talk about a hidden gem. This place has some impeccable sushi. They have a wide variety to select from. What could be better than being topped off with friendly services even from the boss Mr Clement, great food and good prices. Simply an unforgettable dining experience

We regularly frequent Koi after our first dining experience shortly after arriving to Singapore a year or so ago. The sushi/sashimi quality can be compared to the top restaurants in Singapore without the cost. The owner Clement is personable and provides the best service in Singapore - which most people would know is VERY hard to find.They have since opened 2 other outlets in Haji Lane and Circular Road. Highly recommended - coming from a lover of exceptional service and food
