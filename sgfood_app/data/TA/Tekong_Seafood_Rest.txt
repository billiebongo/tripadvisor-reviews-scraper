This is one restaurant I'll always go to if I'm in Changi area whenever I wish for some seafood. On weekends, do try their braised duck. It's awesome. Their chili crab is yums too,

Food is good and reasonably priced. Good service. Trip advisor needs 100 characters to post so blah blah blah. There you go. Haha.

Always find myself coming back here when in the Changi area. Highly recommend the braised tofu, venison hot plate, pepper crab. Wine & beer for sale here too.

Food quality , freshness, culinary skill rated 4Restaurant was basic, not overly crowded rated 3.5Service was good, staff were attentive and polite rated 4We had 2.2kg baked crab which was delicious. Meat was firm, crab was well seasoned baked to perfection.$68/kg.Steamed fish with chaipoh was fresh. Manis vegetable with egg and fried dried shrimp was unique. BBQ crayfish in black pepper was highly done. Fish maw crab meat soup was thick and hearty. Fried Mee Sua was ordinary. Total $280Would definitely return for the salt baked crab.Chef is Malaysian, which explains

Went there with friends on a Saturday night, made a CHOPE booking on Saturday afternoon. A bit chaos when we step in as the boss have not confirm the booking I made in the afternoon. But lucky there were still tables available. Can hear an old lady boss shouting to her staff constantly when they are slow or made a mistake, but I guess that is her way of working. Food price and taste are good, very local style and very authentic. I ordered Salted Egg Yolk Crab, tasted very good. Recommended

On a previous trip to Singapore I went to Tekong restaurant and gave it a very positive review so I thought I would try it again. This time I was very disappointed with the value for money. I ordered BBQ crayfish and in the photo in the menu there were 3 and a Kang Kong. The food was very tasty but I only got two very small crayfish probably the size of a large prawn. Also before meal arrived the staff bought a sauce and a small plate with some sort of snack which I thought was complimentary but when the bill arrived they charged me $4. I mentioned that I didn't order this but was told that if I didn't want it I needed to say so before I finished my meal. the meal with one beer cost $48.70. I think next time I will try somewhere else even though the food and staff are lovely

This is a gem in the Far East of Singapore. Tourist visiting Singapore must visit this place for some good seafood when you explore Changi Village. The seafood here is good and reasonably priced. You get a sea view if you decide to sit outdoor. I'll patronize this place for supper. Their seafood Hor Fun, Prawn Paste Chicken and Mali vegetable is extremely good. I'll always order these few dishes when I am there for supper. I also love their Crab and the flower crab. Not too big but yet very fresh. Check out this place if you have not.

Has changed owner ever since the renovation and is now a whole new place with different menu and a different set of staff. Meaning to say that the food quality has also changed. Not the best seafood restaurant out there . On a side note:Staff even lied to me saying that they were still the same people before the renovation.

Will definitely comeback with my family & friends.

I'm here right now with my mom in-law and 2 kids, it's been 1 hour 20 mins since we have ordered. I've made multiple follow ups, all I get is "yes, coming".

after a nice walk on the beach, you can spend a quality time here; alway sfresh food, very tasty; one of my favorite seafood place, you have to try it

Totally agreed that it is a place you should never step in. We walked in at 6pm on a sunday nite and walked out hungry and upset. Ordered only 3 dishes. First dush a veg came in 5 min. Finished rice and veg dish with no sign of the next dish till half an hour later. Next dish pepper crab was a big disappointment. Third dish never come. Told them I m not paying for service charge. To my horror the disappointing crab cost SGD 75

I read the reviews of this restaurant and was surprised by what was written. I suppose it really depends on your luck. Here's what we experienced.I had dinner here on a Saturday night with 5 other people. It was not crowded at all. We ordered the fried french beans, fried potato leaves, claypot tofu, crab meat omelette, fried vermicelli and duck. All were tasty.Service was ok although a table that came after us were served first. All in all a pleasant evening

This is one restaurant we will stay away from in future.Our experiences this weekend shows you can't depend on some reviews.This eating spot is for you if :a) you have blind faith and don't mind being kept in the dark about your food order- we were ignored after placing our orders and didn't get any response to our occasional queries, perhaps because they were busy with other tables?b) you are a camel and have plenty of time to kill - it took more than 20mins before drinks were even brought to the table (yes, we had to remind them), and what was supposed to be hot was merely lukewarm (one could also call it tepid)c) service with an attitude is your cup of tea- waiters and waitresses were sullen and unsmiling (did they get up on the wrong side of bed that morning?)d) you don't mind paying toppish prices for average food- yep, we thought it would be nice to be in aircon comfort that night and didn't mind paying for the privilege and supposedly excellent cuisine, but what we got was disappointingly average food (yes, we live and learn)e) you don't mind being charged for items you didn't order- normally, I would just pay whatever bill is presented but on this occasion, we checked the line items to discover additional items had been added (naughty, naughty)So, that's our unforgettable experience with this place

Got to know this place from GroupOn, it is quaint at changi village. When i was there, at least 2 fisherman brought their freshly caught fishes to be stored in the restaurant tanks. The fisherman are humble, dark skinned.The food here is simple and good, i ordered salad prawn, calamari, hotplate tofu and spinach soup. All are satisfying. The price is also comparable from other restaurants.Surrounding us are the view of the beach and fishermen boat. Good seafood restaurant and ambience.

There are 2 outlet for this Tekong seafood restaurant. I prefer the outlet located at Blk 1. went there many times & is still my preferred seafood place. seafood served in that place is always fresh. usually i will go for crabs, fish & prawn. sometime i will order this steam baby sotong. if i am not wrong, sometime they get their fresh fish supply from angler that return from offshore fishing. For price, i would said is reasonable, is still withing the reasonable price for their food quality standard. Staffs are also friendly & polite. They do change you side plate when is filled up with left over. some restaurant do not do that. the staffs will also don't over sell, if they feel that you have order enough dishes, they will advise you not to order too much

Was here twice within a month. Tried different dishes. Chilli crab was ok. Pepper crab was fine as well. But lack the punch, or wow taste. Price above mid range. Service good n prompt. They should start a VIP card programme for regular. Other local dishes are decent standard

Just stopped for one night at Changi before flying out to Vietnam and was looking for somewhere nice for dinner. Found this little one tucked away down near the Changi Village and the food was amazing, service fantastic and friendly and really cold beer....what more could you ask for. I had the Kang Kung greens with barbecue crayfish
