This breakfast is simple, tasty and nutritious more like my comfort food. The soft boiled eggs are nicely cooked to my liking and perfection on toast.

Ya Kun is famous for its runny soft boiled eggs. You may prefer your eggs hard boiled. It is not mentioned in the menu, but you can ask for hard boiled eggs - all it takes is just a 10 minute wait. The quality of their eggs is really satisfying with a lovely all bright yolk (yup..no "grey" in those yolks) that is unforgettable in taste and texture. You cannot get freshly made boiled eggs elsewhere...it arrives too hot to hold and you gotta peel it yourself. Just add a dash of salt n pepper and enjoy the simple pleasure of eggs as you like it

The kaya toast was a surprising treat and it went very well with the poach eggs. The portion is somewhat small and I could have eaten several plates of this. The eggs came out just right and the combination of kaya toast and eggs were perfect. The coffee at this shop was also very good and fairly low price compared to other comparable coffee house

Yakun is popular with its home made kaya. But it certainly is not popular with generosity. We came to have breakfast every morning but we have decided that it is our last visit. They are stingy with the spread of kaya. Why call it kaya shop when they spread so little on the bread? When you ask for more they ask you to pay. I realise too that the kaya here is not as fantastic as they claimed to be. There are other places that are so much better and even tastier. Like “Toast Box”, “Coffee and Toast” and even the one at “Toast Junction” in Raffles City food court are thumbs up! And they are generous with their kaya! Will go to these places from now on.

Called in to try a local breakfast of kaya toast with butter, soft boiled eggs and coffee. The place was busy with locals enjoying the same breakfast but this was not to my western taste... worth trying for the experience but will try something else next time

I had some training on how Singaporean orders their eggs and the teas/coffee here. We have ordered a set of the kaya toast with two soft boiled eggs and the tea.The kaya toast was sweet and with butter but it tastes good. The soft boiled eggs on the other hand wasn't what I had in mind so I didn't dare to try.... it came pretty much like uncooked eggs - that's how they would have it... with salt, pepper or some soya sauce.... drink it down... Now... how to order the tea/coffee, Singaporean style... tea and coffee one the menu means tea with sugar. Tea and coffee with an O actually means without milk and sugar, the O is actually the first alphabet for the Chinese dialect that means black... tea and coffee with a C means it will be served with the condensed milk.... pretty confusing right?? But I am learning to allow me to order what I really need in a local kind of place. The chair isn't comfortable as they don't want you to stay too long. Service is very fast but not very attentive

I will not miss having my breakfast at Ya Kun Kaya toast in Singapore. It is my go-to breakfast. Always order the Set 1 which consists of kaya toast, soft-boiled eggs and tea/coffee. Perfect yet simple breakfast. Make sure to buy their kaya as a gifts

So I had heard about ya kun toast and local teas. Raffles City was walking distance from our hotel and we explored this mall a couple of times. We are glad we tried this little Cafe in the mall. I have tried ya kun toast with local tea and coffee in a couple of places and this place is very good. We all loved it and were a little sad we discovered this only in our last days. It's not for everyone, it isn't the finest of culinary delights but it is a delight all the same. Really happy Singapore has embraced this and it's still on offer for us to try it and enjoy it. Will definitely go here again. Recommend it

We visited here with a Singaporean friend. She ordered for us. Crispy light toast sandwich with a rectangle of butter (with a jam) and barley water and strong tea with milk. It was superb. Along side a plate of 2 eggs still half cooked. Mix the eggs in the plate. Add some soy sauce and dip the bread in the wet mixture. Eggy bread Singapore style! You can't go wrong on the price either at under 5 Singapore dollars

It's one of a kind. My 11 and 15 year old particularly liked the steamed kaya with peanut butter (not soo much peanut butter that it because over powering), and the original. The kopi is served in very small cups (compared to US cups), so order the large
