This is a great little food complex (walking distance from Nichol Highway MRT) We ate in numerous stalls & enjoyed all our meals. Good supermarket too. Very close to bus depot where buses depart to Malaysia

I stayed at the Destination Hotel which is across of this place. Came to eat dinner for 3 days and truly enjoyed the food. The place is very clean and not crowded like other hawker centre which is nice because you can enjoy your food peacefully. Recommendation: Thai Nana - Tom Yum Seafood Soup, Wantan Noodle

This hawker centre was directly opposite our hotel the Destination Beach. We came here a couple of times for meals.The stalls are over a couple of floors in the centre. The centre is covered but there is no air conditioning. We found the coolest spots to be tables on the side.As it was our first experience of a hawker centre we spent a while just looking at what the stalls were selling. Fortunately all the menus are in English with accompanying photos of the various dishes. Note that you buy drinks from different stalls to the food .We liked the food from stall 84 on level 1, they do fish and seafood soups. Although cheap you get very large bowls and the soups contain noodles so are quite filling.This centre is very popular with the locals and you will not see too many tourists here

Very much the same with many amazing local food at affordable price. Too many selection to choice from and I tried the fried char kway teow on the second level that adds kai lan and fried sliver fish as topping. It has the char tar favor which is nice and hard to find nowadays. Surely will come back to try others next time.

This food centre is very popular with office workers and tourists because it offers a good variety of local street food at very reasonable prices. It is always crowded during lunch time. Here are my favourite dishes: hainan hokkien mee, chicken rice, char kway teow, mutton soup/sup tulang, yong tau foo. Koothurar nasi biryani is at Blk 17 Beach Road, behind the food centre. The nasi biryani is excellent. Kopi More at B1-49 sells Nanyang coffee (local blend) prepared wit expresso machine. There are also stalls selling drinks and fruits. You're spoilt for choice

3 levels of multiple food court, with every type of food, dessert and drinks you would like! Cost is reasonable and there are plenty of seats. Only stairs no lift so not pram friendly. Other than that it seems very authentic food as I see mostly locals around here. Would recommend!

This hawker centre was opposite our hotel and was our first experience with Hawker centres. Didnt know what to really expect and wondered about the hygeine of the place. Therew as no reason to worry and Singapore is very strict when it comes to health and Hygeine. A hawker centre consists of different food stalls, ranging from chinese to malay to indian (and others). Walking around you feel like having a bit of everything, it felt so alien yet familiar at the same time.First day we went to this Indian place who cooked the food that is of comfort. The kid of food you get your hands dirty for. Every dish was delicately spiced, the paya, okra bhaji, you name it. Came with steaming hot roti and rice.It was at this place that I was introduced to Sup Tulang (bone marrow soup) well Sup is a bit misleading. Its bone marrow in a thick red sauce which goes very well with roti or rice. We sure got our hands dirty for that one (as evident by red stained hands still the next day)Drinks are sold seperately from a different stall including the famous pulled tea.Hawker centres are awesome cheap and full of delicious food, if you goto Singapore try to at least goto one Hawker centre as you will miss out if you don'

We enjoyed halal chicken rice on the bottom floor and followed that up with fruit drinks from a place called Sara also on the bottom floor. Altogether, we paid maybe $35 SD for 5 people. Masjid Hajjah Fatimah is very close by and worth visiting before coming here

Go to Kopi More if you want to have a cup of delicious local blend coffee prepared with an expresso machine. The coffee is rich and has no acidic aftertaste. Can be pared with the local hawker food sold there. Must tries include the Hainan hokkien mee, Golden Mile Special Yong Tau Foo, Keng Heng Teo Chew Lor Mee and Yew Chuan clay pot rice. Most of these stalls will have a long queue during lunch, go before 11 am or after 1.30 pm to avoid the lunch crowd

Two levels of good food awaits. From chicken rice to prawn noddles and fried Hokkien Mee to fish soup. Lunch time would see a many office workers from nearby offices.
Try going after lunch hours to avoid long Qs.

A wide range of stalls with lots of different menus. Lots of choice here regardless of what you like.
Getting a seat first and then making a choice is a good idea

Went here in July - lots of different stands here...we were after sup tulang and found the place in the bottom floor that sold it. No price in the menu and afterwards ended up paying too much for 1 course.On other stand we had chicken & rice, good as well. Most stands have dishes around 3-6 dollars, you'll probably find something that suits you

Looking out of our room from our Hotel, Destination, we noticed this food court. Took us 1 minute to walk over and little more time to find a nice stall for something to eat. Dinner consisted of a plate of Pad Thai, best my wife and daughter ever had, a plate of Thai pineapple rice (delicious), 20 satay and some lime juice for S$25. Free seating around the stalls n a local atmosphere. So if you stay at the Destination and are hungry......run

Coffee stall in Golden Mile Food Centre basements. Freshly grounded beans, The owners prepares each coffee aka "Kopi" with his coffee machine. There is also tea (Teh) and salted egg custard buns. His coffee has a very strongly taste as compared to normal sweet coffee in Singapore

Finding a low cost place to eat in Singapore isn't easy and this is where hawker centres come into their own. This centre is immediately opposite the Destination Hotel (where we stayed) and at little more than $5 a head for a filling meal, one can't go wrong. Freshly squeezed juices can also be had for around $1- $2

Just went to Golden mile food centre for lunch with my mate.Not too crowded, pretty well ventilated and of course, lots of choices to choose from at cheap prices.The roasted duck rice, prawn noodles and beef noodles are some of the dishes worth trying for.

This popular hawker center has been around for more than 30 years. It offers plenty of Singaporean Chinese eats by day and is dominated by Indian Muslim and Malay food by night. This venue offers 3 levels of local food stalls, many of which have developed regular patrons.Favorites include Yong Tau Foo, boneless chicken rice, Hokkien Prawn Mee, curry mee and glutinous rice ball desserts. We particularly enjoy the Indian Muslim mutton soup, new goreng and sup tulang in the basement.

We stayed in Premier Inn which was just across from the Golden Mile Food Centre. There are many stalls with many different kind of food for us to try. Food are cheap but delicious. But you need to get used to eating with no air-conditioning in hot Singapore. We were sweating while eating but it's all worth it, Try to find a table near a fan makes a difference. You need to be an adventurous travelers in order to enjoy this eating experience. We had breakfast, lunch and dinner during our 4 days stay at the Premier Inn

We stayed at the fairly new Premier Inn across the street and we were lucky to have this a 2min walk away. Wish we could've tried more, but there is so much to eat in Singapore and your stomach is only so big! We tried several stalls mentioned before including the Pauline Thai, a Malay Laksa stand, and a vietnamese place. The ultimate find, though, was a guy on the lower level doing delicious black or white singaporean "carrot cake" He also did an oyster omelet that looked fantastic. It seemed like mostly locals no matter the time, but everyone we encountered was super friendly to us. Prices were a little less than other stands we visited, and quality was just as good or better depending on the dish. Definitely would return, and would even go out of my way since it seemed like more of an authentic experience than Maxwell Road or Lau Pa Sat, which while very pretty, was our least favorite center
