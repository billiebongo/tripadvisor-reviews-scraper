Food is good but price is on the high side. Service is excellent . The lotus bun tastes good. May go again if there is an occasion.
4
Very nice dim sum place but expect the price to be on the higher end. Nice ambience for family dining.
3
I met a friend for lunch here and enjoyed a shared bowl of congee with century egg and dimsum. The fried taro was very nice but the siomai and shrimp dumplings were ordinary.
4
decided to visit for lunch one day and tried their seasonal seafood bamboo clam which was very fresh and had good texture. overall the dim sum items were good and reasonably priced. would recommend people to try out their lunch as its more affordable
4
Loved the ambience, however the waitress serving us spoilt my mother's birthday cake surprise. We did tell her it was a surprise.
The roasted peking duck was so-so, it would have been better to let us wrap the skin ourself. :)
4
Have a wonderful dinner at the restuarant with my family. The staff were provide
Ing excellent service. Will visit again

We usually book this restaurant for special occasion as we rather have a peace of mind. CNY is around the corner and their ambience was great with those decorations. Food were served in timely manner which is good for those hungry kids. And one of the dish we ordered (tofu) had become everyone's favorite.
5
Booked dim sum for lunch here, I was seriously impressed by all the dishes. Siew mai was juicy and prawns was crunchiness. Highlight was the steamed bamboo clams, inaniwa udon with prawns and the daily soup. The daily soup is something I can drink every day, filled with the goodness of the fresh ingredients.More importantly, the service staff actually showed me warm hospitality i feel is lacking in today's F &B scene. The madam servicing my table told me to eat my bamboo clam while its hot, attentively changing my plate whenever it looked a bit wet. Impressed

We had dinner with family of 10 at this restaurant on a Saturday night. Most of their chicken dishes were sold out. Be sure to pre-order the chicken dish especially the crispy roast chicken during reservation. The manager recommended the ginger chicken in Hong Kong style which they had the last half left. It's like our Hainanese chicken version which I find it not bad. Half chicken cost $21.00. The crispy pork belly is a must order which cost $14.80++ for 9 pieces. Luckily they still have Peking duck available which was good. The manager also recommended the braised eggplant and minced pork in clay pot which was full of flavour. However, the dishes were slow to come. They had forgotten our pork ribs dish which we had to cancel since we finished all our dishes. A little disappointing for that night. Overall, it was still quite an enjoyable dinner for the family though price was on the high side and we are expecting better service

My family came here for lunch yesterday and the food was fantastic ... really authentic Cantonese cuisine!Not just the steamed dumplings like har gao and siew mai, the other dim sum dishes like zhar leong (rice roll with fritter) and dace ball congee were great!We found that this Crystal Jade Palace served Cantonese cuisine, whereas the one opposite atParagon had more Teochew dishes like porridge with pomfret
4
Was there to celebrate my MIL’s birthday and the staff really put in a lot of effort! They will dress up the cake and put shou taos around it. Plus the staff will sing happy birthday along with you!
1
To cite the most unpleasant experience of all was the collection of plates and utensils when we had not even finished our dinner.
4
The food here is not cheap but is simply delightful. I had a half roast chicken which had crispy skin and juicy meat... the perfect combination for this dish. Would definitely be back for more.
4
Quality food and service was good! Definitely a good value for family or gathering with friends. Try their specialty crispy chicken or Beijing duck!
4
Excellent Cantonese and Teochew cuisine in an upmarket restaurant. Even Teochew porridge is available. It boasts of one Michelin star! Prices are moderate.
4
Great service. Good food. The only minus is that every staff expects me to speak Chinese which I could not. Some staff does not understand English so I had some difficulty communicating (they would then have to call their colleagues over to translate/speak to me)
4
Having not eaten at this restaurant for a number of years I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of their dim sum. This is a large restaurant with a high turnover at weekends yet the food was served hot although there was the occasional delay between dishes. The service was attentive although the staff were obviously stretched. This is a particularly family orientated establishment and thus popular for birthdays
4
This is my go to for dim sum. All items are well made and of excellent quality. While the Crystal Jade Golden Palace at Paragon is more refined (and has an air of stuffiness), I find this outlet at Ngee Ann to be more relaxed yet still good. Items outside of the dim sum menu are all well made too. The inner seating area looks old so if get there before peak meal times, do ask to be seated at the front. It gets busy here around 12pm and 630pm especially on the weekends. Reservations are a must.
4
I have been to this place and familiar with the type of food offered. However, when asked about a particular food that I've ate before and not in the menu (because the captain recommended), the captain commented that is this your first time here? It doesn't feel nice with such comments.However, the captain service was good and environment is great. Definitely a place recommended for gathering or family meal
4
The quality of both food and service dipped significantly, following the sale of the chain to a Private Equity firm. Since then, they have recovered. The Cantonese food (with a few Teochew dishes) is again reliable and good, even if there is no innovation or much experimentation compared to competitors. Service has also improved; the staff make an effort to be helpful and friendly, although recently we had to wait an inexplicable 20 minutes for a simple soy chicken takeaway! Among the majors (which group includes Imperial Treasure, Ocean, etc), this is the only place where you can call on Saturday and manage to get a booking at noon for next day Sunday lunch!
4
Delicious local food. A lot of choices and prompt service. A commendable place to go if you want to try local delicacies.
4
Had a lovely meal with my Wife. It's a mileslife merchant so a great way to have great food and pick up extra miles.
5
Good quality food, staffs very friendly n provide prompt n good service! Is a good place for all sorts of event. Convenient place for gathering! I have been there many times. Will definitely go again n will recommend to all my friends.
4
Had dinner with my Wife. We enjoyed the food and the service was good. Would definitely be back again!
4
Fried quail was tasty and crispy. Mustard green with crab meat and fish maw was slightly salty . Peking duck slice was delicately presented so was the suckling pig slices.
4
Restaurant was very accommodating. Had to change from my reservation for 12 pax to 18 pax, no hassle. Enjoyed our lunch dim sum there. Price was reasonable..
4
Known locally as one of the top places for Cantonese dimsum. Prompt quick service. Consistent quality though probably not up to the best on offer in HK. Good location. Good staff. Can be expensive. Bookings recommended during peak dining times: especially if bringing business associates. Also offers upmarket imaginative Cantonese menu À la Carte. The roast suckling pig very good.
5
I have to admit that I was never attracted to Crystal Jade Palace or Crystal Jade Golden Palace because of its brand positioning as a quick-service noodle restaurant and rather dull dim sum.But over the past month, I have visited Crystal Jade Palace at Ngee Ann City twice. I must say that the food was impressive and so was the service! The price point is rather reasonable at this Cantonese fine-dining level.On my most recent visit, we had: roast pork belly, soup of the day, steamed fish, stir-fried vegetables, crispy noodles with seafood, selection of dim sum (4 items) and dessert, for a lunch part of 4 persons - the bill came to over $300.The food was excellent and exquisitely prepared - portions were appropriate, just enough to please and tease! Overall service was very good too - attentive and prompt.My old friend, Mr Sammy Tam (aka and better known as: 德哥 or Tuck-Gor in Cantonese), formerly from East Ocean, Victoria Peak and Ah Yat, is now managing this Crystal Jade Palace on the 4th floor of Ngee Ann City (Takashimaya).So this has changed my perception of Crystal Jade Palace - no longer merely a Cantonese noodle bar or cheap uneventful dim sum..
5
I went there a couple of times already. And always feel welcome by the hosts & servers. The food is pretty authentic. The dim sum is delicious & average pricing I will say. For a better experience, you should always try to make reservation before going there.
4
Wonderful location. The food we ordered were fantastic. Service was outstanding, with the service staff being very accommodating and friendly.There was a promotional price for the peking duck which was lovely, but the price of the steamed fish came as a bit of a shocker at SGD$128, so that pulled the value down to average for me.But regardless, overall a wonderful experience
5
Food are very delicious, the restaurant are tastefully decorated, great place for dine.
Price is ATAS, but since service is also ATAS, and great taste for all the dishes that we ordered. Especially the roasted chicken, nice
5
one of the best simple & comforting chinese new year dinner that our family enjoyed. we will definitely be visiting crystal jade palace every year from now on.
4
Whenever I am in Singapore, 'Crystal Jade', will be one of my favourite eating place. Good food, good service and comfortable relaxing place.
3
Very nice setting restaurant. But Dim sum lunch was very expensive. Food was ok and as expected for a fine dining restaurant
4
Had a dinner gathering at Crystal Jade Palace with some friends and was very happy with my experience there. Food and service was particularly good. Staff were very friendly and made my French Friend felt very much at home. Keep up the good service.
5
One of the best Chinese restaurants in the city. From the facility, to the menu and the service. You cannot go wrong with Crystal Jade. Food quality is tops. Service is just as good. The person who took our reservation even prepared a simple menu for us. For a group of 10 (or 12, was it?), you can have a private room with your family or friends for a more personalized dining experience. I can recommend the ff based on our last visit:Crispy roasted pork, Chilled century egg with pickled pink ginger, Peking duck, Steam live coral trout with supreme soya sauce, Poached live prawns, Braised Sze Chuan bean curd (mabo tofu), Poached Chinese spinach with egg trio, Wok-fried duck meat served on lettuce, Yang zhou fried rice, Mango sago, Mochi.Efficient service. Helpful waitresses. Fantastic food. Crystal Jade is consistently good
5
Recommended by our hotel concierge as we don't like pork. We ordered shrimp, scallop, tofu, fish and broccoli. Everything was as we expected. Our dim sum was better than what we experienced in Hong Kong.Best service and a huge place located on the 4th floor
4
It was pricey compared to its other outlets but the food quality matches the price hence was satisfied with the overall dining experience except 1 comment on the dish - Hong You Chao Shou which was a disappointment as it tastes plain and nothing near to the food expectation
5
The dim sum lunch was outstanding, great choices and service. We brought our four travelling companions back for dinner, shared 6 courses including rice and noodles, and every dish was superb.The restaurant is very well presented, staff are friendly and efficient and food is 10/10
5
Reached the place on a Sunday 2pm without any queue which is a plus for us in choosing a place to eat dimsum in orchard. We were greeted by cheerful staffs guided to our near the entrance. Food was served very promptly, waitress were swift, dimsum was scrumptious, well prepared and the meal was value for money.
5
Among my favourite restaurants in Singapore, a must on every visit. Start off with dim sums followed by amazing steamed fish. If going there without a reservation then be there early, else the wait can be long.
4
Excellent lunchtime stop for dim sum, fantastic selection of dim sum although make sure you order enough as the service can be rather slow and sometimes it takes forever to get their attention
4
Had lunch there last week. Found the standard still maintained and service good All the staff were attentive and friendly. The crabmeat noodles were fantastic and unusual and roast chicken were very goodThe moon cakes were very good as it was not so sweet and low in sugar. Will definitely returned again
4
Was introduced to this restaurant a few years ago when we were on holiday. It was always pleasant with good food and service.We always make sure we come here every trip. With no surprise we had another good dinner here tonight.The sucking pig, steam fish, veg and crisp skin chicken was all good. Wash down with half bottle of Pinot, that's a good start for our holiday
3
We had dinner for family gathering from overseas. Manage to secure quickly seat for lunch on weekday without any reservation. The food is quite good. Barbeque Pork and roasted pork are good. We also order roasted duck. We ordered steam fish but after 30 mins they approached us and told us that the fish quality is not good and they cannot serve. We were sorry but appreciate the quality control they put in place. Price is at high level. Be ready to fork out your mone
1
Ordered a promotion Beijing duck and only to be told after 15min after placing that it is sold out. Missed out one of my another of my order. Appetitiser only came out in the middle of the meal. For a supposedly the type range of Crystal Jade restaurant, it feels like worst than eating at zhuchar. Soup came first with vegetables and white rice only. There was a pause of 20min after I finish the vegetables and soup. The wait was painful and totally unlike of a Chinese restaurant. This is really not something I would enjoy to have my dishes separately served.Very bad experience which I will not come back again, food was very average
4
It is a good Resturant for family or business. I always show my customer about this Resturant because of the taste. The Resturant serve fine Cantonese steam food at a reasonable rate. The service is not really fantastic but the taste of the food could compensat
5
Have been visiting here for many years and it continues to be a favorite for dim sum lunch in Singapore. really lovely dumplings. Service is great - some quite witty and engaging staff. its a bit of a wait if you turn up without a booking but it provides a great rest and feed on a shopping outing in orchard Rd
3
On the exterior it looks really grand and appealing. At the reception, they missed out my reservation. Which was acceptable as such does happens at times. But the attitude given by the receptionist wasnt too welcoming and warm. Was given a seat in another corner of the restaurant which looks extremely different in terms of decorations and setup. Food wise, average. Used to be one of my favourite dimsum and dining venue. Be the standard has dropped to quite a significant standard. Quite Disappointing.
5
The food served here can be comparable with those served in high class Hong Kong Cantonese restaurant and the food serving was big and value for money (in Singapore terms). Service was good and food can be prepared fast (in lunch time). the restaurant is located in Ngee Ann City, a local landmark that no one would miss, so it is a good place for all travelers to taste Chinese dim sum in Singapore.
2
Was very good, dropped to good and now to below average. This is due to high turnover of Chef. Hope they can get their acts together again.
4
This is a well known Cantonese restaurant in Ngee Ann City. Great for weekend dim sum brunch but best be advised to make advanced reservation. Good selection of favorite dim sum dishes, porridge and ala carte menu. Excellent service especially in private rooms.
3
Nice place, good food and cheap. Went there with some friends and enjoyed Sharing some different Chinese food in a quiet relaxed atmosphere
4
A nice restaurant serving authentic Cantonese food.
The service was efficient and the food was very tasty.
My favourites were the seafood crispy noodles and the wasabi prawns.
The chrysanthemum tea they serve is wonderful to wash it all down with.
Will come here again
4
Enjoyed the first visit, went back again. Selecting from the menu list is easy when accompanied by a local friend. Service is fast, staff efficient, no pressure to move on at the end of the meal. Good value for money.
5
We had our dinner at Crystal Jade Palace, ordered stir-fry beef with mushroom, broccoli with crabmeat and roe, prawns done 2 ways (head was fried with salted egg yolk and meat was sauté with celery), the sandy texture of the salted egg yolk with the crispy prawn head is just perfect.Suckling pig combination is also another dish we love, we mixed it with roast duck and roast pork. The skin of the suckling pig and roast pork is so crispy that it just melt in your mouth with a couple of bites. Worthy to mention is that all the sauté dishes have a very nice smokey taste from the wok(wok-hei). This is very tradition for nice Chinese restaurant to have this taste, as it requires just the right amount of heat to the wok, for the taste to the transferred to the dishes.Definitely we will be back again
4
We ordered mainly Dim Sum like Xiu Mai, Pao, Fried carrot cake, 'Char Siew Shou', Steam rice roll with meat, and a plate of Hor Fun. Also we have Pu-er Tea. Good food quality, fresh shrimps and tasty meat. Hor fun a bit bland but is good for the healthy eater. The only set back is the service staff seems to lose patience on us when we took too long to decide type of tea we want. Ambience is good
4
Of all the dim sum places I have tried, Crystal Jade Palace was my favourite. However, they seem to have changed policies to the food, which has been quite disappointing.The dimsum is still delicious generally, and on my recent outing, we enjoyed har gao (shrimp dumplings), siew mai, carrot cake fried with minced meat, salted egg custard buns.Now, to my disappointments:My favourite, the roasted pork belly ($13 for an approximately 6cm x 6cm square) had gotten more expensive shrunk, but was still crispy and delicious.The glutinous rice had shrunk and they skimped on the minced meat filling. The flavour was gone too.The rice roll was lacking char siu.We were very disappointed with the first two changes because they were the two dishes that set Crystal Jade apart.Reserve a table beforehand to make sure you have a seat, because they fill up quickly on weekends. If you have time, go on a weekday to enjoy a slow lunch. Service is much better then too because the staff are not so harried and hurried

This is one of the restaurants that my family love for having dim sum in Singapore. The dishes that we always order:a. Har gaob. Roasted crispy chickenc. Fried carrot caked. Steamed rice rolls (chee cheong fun)e. Fish porridgee. Signature fried riceDo not need to waste money on its dessert. Not worth it.Sometimes my family also order its char siu sou (baked bbq pork pastry).We often visit Crystal Jade Palace because of the quality of the food and its service. I do not speak Mandarin or any of Chinese dialects and its staffs can speak English. It helps a lot.391 Orchard Road, #04-19 Ngee Ann City, Ngee Ann City, 238872Tel + 65 6735 2388Opens daily from 11.30am – 3pm, 6pm – 11pmPlease make reservation as it is often fully booked

This is Crystal Jade chain's flag ship restaurant in Singapore. It is located inside the Takashimaya shopping centre in the middle of Orchard road. The decor is very nice and upscale. We had dim sum lunch. All the dishes are good and I especially liked their roast duck. It could be because Chinese food is so bad in San Diego where I live... I would definitely go back and it is a good place for a meal if you are shopping on Orchard road
