The appetisers was great! Calamari was good. Spaghetti were nice. Dessert was special. I like the ambiance there. Its a small place and its cosy.
5
I love the ambience of the restaurant. The service was attentive and efficient. The portion of food was sufficient.

My favourite Italian at Changi.
Try "Fai Te" the menu and wait for the surprises. Delicious. Good value for money.
5
Other than the lightly battered calamari rings, you must also try the lovely seafood spaghetti. Remember to keep the garlic bread for the savoury tomato sauce - so rich in beta carotene.
Call for a reservation. It's full house on a Thursday night!

First time here and loving this place, great food and fantastic service. We tried the chicken soup, seafood spaghetti, tiramisu for dessert and my fav chianti (red wine). Would love to try other dishes in my next visit, especially the calamari and prawn!
5
We had calamari and a seafood pasta. The calamari was so soft and delicious. Very different from the usual chewy ones you get here. It was super delicious, It is a small cozy restaurant and even on a weekday night it was almost full. Must reserve a table One of the best Italian places in Singapore I must say

It maybe unfair to rate a restaurant by comparing it to the the origins of the food they state they offer. However, I went there to expect southern Italian cuisine and actually the menu was disappointing, They offered a 6 dish course but only on questioning did I get told that we would probably need at least 1 main or 2 as it may not be enough. Now this selection was $40 SGD ++ each and we would probably need to spend another $25-30 on mains too. This is a small restaurant that is almost identical in decor to when it opened seemed steep.We were placed on the Mezzanine level with the air con aimed directly at us. Admittedly they switched it off for us on request, but put it back on, full blast when another couple joined us. They didn't even adjust the temperature to compromise between the 4 people nor was it switched off when the other 2 left.The wine was great and fairly priced, but the experience other poorly worded menu offerings and almost the disinterest from the proprietor, means we wont be back agin

Have treated my friends to set lunch at Porta porta separately as the fare surely clicked with the ladies. It served world-best calamari, succulent Vongole pasta & warm chicken or fish soup for the soul. Though it's priced above $30 per pax, the authentic cuisine is well worth the price.

This is one of my favorites in the east area for Italian food. Less known probably because of its location, away from the well known eating spots and shopping places. Place is very small, but cozy and welcoming inside.It's not cheap, but definitely worth the money as service and taste of food is excellent.Good for a family dinner/lunch or a small business lunch. Due to the limited space, probably may not fit it a large group.Definitely recommended

We came to this family run restaurant 20 years ago. It still looks the same and the food is delicious as always. It is a very small restaurant far off any crowded place and you will not find it by coincidence. Food is home cooked Italian. No pizzas, no fancy stuff. Solid food like at home. Cozy, friendly and casual place with a very homely feeling. Good pastas and mains. Limited selection of wine. No corkage fee from Mon-Thu. We had the menu for two and it comes with a variety of delicious antipasti and starters, a pasta, a main and two desserts. Once again a great evening at this lovely place
5
Their Calamari dish is a MUST order. The squid is very fresh and lightly battered. My family loves the Prawn cream Farfalle and the Black squid ink pasta. The pasta is always al dente ! For someone new to this restaurant, perhaps, order the Fai Te ( variety of small portions for 2 to share ). For someone who misses authentic Italian food, this is the place for a quick fix.The restaurant isn't big so pre booking will be best.

This is a place we go to with our dear friends in SG. It is their favourite place. It has a homely feel about it. The service is great. The food is really good quality and generous portions. I had their pasta (vongole which is my favourite pasta) which was fantastic. It's not the best location, quite far from the centre of town, near the airport. We go because of our friends and love it.
4
Family dinner at Porta Porta was a great experience. The BYO wine added a lot of charm to the evening (not to mention the fact that the bill looked very reasonable too)!Portions are quite big, but since the food is so tasty, every morsel gets polished off
4
I went there with a group of friends for a Christmas dinner, great place, great food, friendly staff. I ordered the penne which is really good, but for me the highlight was the butterfly pasta (creamy pasta with prawns). It was really good and memorable, I would definitely come back for this meal. The size of restaurant is rather small, so please make sure that you make a reservation in advance. Not really accessible via public transport, so I suggest you take a cab or drive there. Overall, a very pleasant experience, one of the best pasta I have ever had in my life
5
Very pleasant experience for a lunch, you just pick meat or fish and then they serve you a Delicious appetizer of fig with olive oil served with a great bread, then come a small pasta dish, then the main dish then a dessert and a coffee. The lamb was excellent. Good ambiance and service! Recommende

A very down to earth, homely interior decor.. only tried the pastas.. they have quite a variety of pastas.. no pizzas... not a lot of choice or wines but for the month of August, they won't have corkage charge if you byo wines.. not very easily accessible.. but its quite a nice place overall with not too much of the urban buzz, hype and crowd... will be back

The lightly battered and timely fried calamari rings and its BYO policy (on Wednesday nights) is always for my family to Porta Porta. Tucked in a row of old shophouses along Upper Changi Road, just opposite the prison is this long time cosy family restaurant that is always well-patronised by friends, couples, and families. So, do make your reservations to ensure that you will not be disappointed. Our favourite dish is the fried calmari rings which we have purposely tried and compared to many restaurants. So far, none is better than what Porta Porta can produce as they have mastered the duration, amount of batter and heat of the oil very well. Another of our favourite is 'Fai Te' (for min 2 pax) which allows you to have a taste of the variety of tasty Italian food from their menu in smaller portions. The cosiness of its ambience is also a great chill-out place for the mid-week or any family dinners, especially if you are around the eastern side of Singapore

A friend of us suggested this restaurant. So we drove all the way from clark quay. We were a group of six persons. We all ordered pasta. Just 5 dishes came. One dish they forgot. One part of the group has already finished there dish, when the last dish finally arrived. Not one single word of sorry or any complimentary item, nothing. Besides this is the quality of the food just standard. I would not recommend this place 
5
Our kids always asked us to dine at Porta Porta for good reasons. 1. Antipasti is appetising enough. Ciabatta bread with condiments in olive oil is a must have. 2. Calamari is the best one can find! 3. Vongole is consistently succulent. 4. Roast lamb is memorable. 5 Homemade coconut ice cream is fantastic!While we dined, at least 3 couples were turned away as they did not make reservations. It's telling that this place is a favourite to many through word of mouth.
5
Luckily we have family in Singapore who have been to Porta Porta more than a few times otherwise we would never have dropped in on an Italian opposite the prison and next to a gas station! Clearly not a problem for the patrons as we had to book our table and the restaurant was otherwise full! I was compelled to have the tasting menu which I'm sorry I can't remember the Italian name for. Even as I ordered I thought this was a mistake not having the largest of appetites but right from the off, an antipasti with freshly baked bread I was proven wrong. The dishes came thick and fast with calamari, a chicken soup, a pasta dish, a slow roasted slice of lamb plus much more I can't remember it all! The food kept my interest and everything tempted further tasting! Brilliant night, lovely staff and fantastic food! Thank you team Porta Porta

The cream prawn pasta s must to order .The lamb is good .Nice restaurant in a very quiet neighbourhood .

Went here twice now and the food is great and the host very friendly. If you need some good homely Italian food this is the place to be.
5
This was our highlight of Singapore ,great food lovely service .
They put our baggage aside for us as we were on our way to the airport.
The food was the best

No matter if it is our romantic date night, or an anniversary, we choose Porta Porta when we crave Italian food that I love, being Italian myself. Razi, the owner, spent more than 20 years in Italy learning her mother-in-law's recipes. We always get the spaghetti vongole with baby clams. I have even taken the extra sauce home to use in my own pasta the next day! The meat dishes are wonderful too. Her homemade bread dipped in olive oil os yum! The tiramisu is great. make reservations because she is always filled and they do not advertise; it is word of mouth. If you like extar spicy, you can always bring some chillie flakes with you as her food is mild, but very flavorful. I would eat here every week if I could!

Didn't know this place till my partner suggested. Nice, cozy little restaurant situated in an unexpected location, opposite Changi Prison. They only serv 3 types of set lunches. Vegetarian, Meat or Seafood selection. I had the seafood selection but had my soup changed to minestrone. Love the spaghetti vongonle - simply divine. Calamari doesn't come with any dipping sauce. The batter is so light that you don't find it greasy. Tiramisu is one of the best i had so far.This place is definitely my top choice for Italian food.
5
Not an Italian but would think that the fare served is authentic enough. Kids & us adults loved the calamari, vongole pasta & roast lamb, on top of the antipasti & desserts. Go for the more elaborate (Fai te) set dinner menu as the variety will fill & amaze you. We are repeat customers for years. Tasty
5
I was referred by my Singaporean friend to come to visit this restaurant. This is my second time coming here. They have 2 outlet, in Stanley Rd (near MRT Raffles) and Changi area (10 minutes from MRT Expo by cab).My favorite menu is crispy squid. The taste is delicious and indeed very tender. The ambience is cozy and relaxing. Appropriate if you would spend and enjoy your valuable time with your love one.I recommend all of you to visit this restaurant when you are in Singapore

Came here thanks to a friend's rave reviews. Unfortunately, could not find any redeeming quality to the establishment. The decor was pretty kitschy and in dire need of refurbishment. Prices were expensive. Quality of food was appalling. Apparently the black squid ink pasta is good, but this was sold out when I went. The pasta my partner ordered was undercooked. They were kind enough to offer to make a fresh plate. Incredibly the second plate was a touch better, but still not al dente. The proprietor insisted it was, and that was how they had always cooked it. OK, if you say so! Leaving aside the pasta, the sauce tasted like canned tomatoes tossed with some meat and cheese. Definitely not worth the $20+ they were charging. At this point, my partner had had enough and declined the offer to try another dish. The proprietor seemed peeved off by the whole thing and did not seem at all apologetic. To their credit, they did not charge us for that plate. That said, the place was full on a Friday night. Maybe we just ordered the wrong items...In any event, sorry, there are heaps of Italian restaurants out there and there's simply no incentive for us to go back

A little Italian restaurant tucked away in a corner in the eastern part of the island, in suburbia Changi. My partner and I have been going there off and on for the past decade, and the quality of the food has been consistently good. Started by Dino, an Italian from Naples who has since passed away, the restaurant is now helmed by Rozi, Dino's wife. Rozi had been cooking alongside Dino since the restaurant started, and she has kept up the quality of the food. It is the sort of food that your favourite nonna would cook for you.The menu has a set lunch, set dinner, and a la carte. Prices are very sensible since this is not in the city. The servings are generous. We had the house platter of antipasti ($16.50) which consist of 4 items - capsicum peppers, 2 types of mushrooms, aubergines, all cooked in olive oil. The warm bread that came along was lovely.For mains, I ordered black ink pasta ($27.50) which came with chopped squid and chilli. It was spicy and really good. Rozi said many customers love this dish.My partner had seafood linguini ($29.50) in white wine.For dessert my partner ordered his favourite tiramisu ($8.50).I ordered lemon sherbet ($7.50), one of the best, and served frozen in a hollowed-out lemon skin. On my next visit I will order coconut sherbet served frozen in a hollowed-out coconut.We had 3 glasses of sangiovese to go with the meal ($12 each).At the end of the dinner, Rozi sent two glasses of complimentary white sambuca to our table. A very nice touch.We were there on a week night. Weekends tend to be crowded, so best to make reservations. 6545-3108. I think the restaurant can seat 30 people comfortably. It is in two levels.The menu has not changed in all these years, though there are daily specials. What I like very much about this restaurant is its BYO policy Tues - Thurs. Corkage is minimal. The place is closed on Mondays.There is another restaurant by the same name in the city - owned by Dino's sister
5
This restaurant has been here for many years and is always an eating place I will come when I am around Changi. For tourists who visit Changi Chapel, it is just a short walk away. Deco is very retro and you will find that there is no menu. However they have daily special set meal where you can have a few choices. Fantastic food and ambience. Price is reasonable. We love the tiramisu

Beautiful restaurant in a traditional looking shop house . Wonderful ambience and authentic Italian food run by a father son duo. Experience was lovely
5
Me and my Boyfriend had a wonderful time here. We enjoy the food, especially the whole place and ambiance. Very Home'y classic italian style. Romantic,quiet and the music is just right for the place 'Italian music'. Is like you are away from singapore totally different. The food is great. Service is good as well talk to the owner and found out that there's a lot of wonderful story behind it. Its already 33 years since it was establish. People who love arts and romantic, touching stories, food and wines this is the right place for you.We will definetly go here again. :

Situated in a remote east part of Singapore, directly across the Changi Prison. I have completely forgotten about this nice little cosy place where I had a wonderful italian meal abt.15 years ago. Glad I drove pass this place one day and my memories starts recollecting. Reserved a meal on Valentine Day and was concerned the std may have drop after such a long time. Had an enjoyable meal and at a very reasonable cost of $60/pax for a 8-course dinner! The whole ambience is nice and homely. Defintely wld be coming back for more

I first heard of Porta Porta from a taxi driver who said it was the best Italian restaurant in Singapore. I promptly forgot about it, but remembered the name. When I came across a Groupon promotion for the place, I decided to check it out. I'm so glad I did! This was one of the best Italian meals I've had in Singapore. I've been to my fair share of fine dining Italian restaurants in town, including places like Oso, Senso, Valentino etc. I thought Porta Porta was better. They have a vast menu, with plenty of pastas. The calamari we had for a starter was the best I've ever had. It was delicious and crispy without any excess batter. I ordered the spaghetti vongole for my main. It had plenty of taste with lots of clams and a nice spicy kick to it. My partner had the osso bucco which was very tender with a nice, rich sauce to it. Looking around the restaurant, all the dishes looked very appealing, so I don't think you can go wrong with this place! Another plus was the wine servings by glass were very generous. I hate places that try to cut corners and fortunately, Porta Porta isn't one of them. Finally, the service was very attentive and the place had a nice warm, cosy atmosphere (the lighting is a bit bright though, so probably not the most romantic spot). It's not as slick and posh as some other Italian restaurants in town, but trust me, this is a good thing

Other reviewers have already said very positive things about Porta-Porta and I completely agree with them.I ate there twice while visiting two sons and a daughter-in-law in Singapore. We are a family of Italophiles ( I lived in Italy for years and they have all spent considerable time there). They had discovered the restaurant and were fulsome in their praise for it.They recommended the Tasting Menu which we had both times as it was such good value, so interesting and authentic and so reminiscent of Italy.The charming lady who ensures very friendly front-of-house service is the owner. She could hardly be more helpful. The decor is warm and welcoming, the atmosphere relaxing and you could readily be in Italy: photos of the family. the owner and her Italian husband and son, dress the walls alongside photos of prominent Italian stars and celebrities, past and present. Another, unusual attractive aspect of the restaurant is that on certain weekdays you can bring your own wine with no charge for corkage. A not inconsiderable factor in the expensive frequently over-priced dining scene in Singapore
4
A wonderful experience of enjoying qualitative Italian cuisine at great value! The portion was just right. Good dainty sense! Decor is nice with some character for a restaurant. Cosy & good for warm party. Great customer service in cheery spirit. That makes a whole lot of difference to the environment. Good food, good service & good company of course

Porta Porta is a very nice family owned restaurant located away from the center of Singapore, near the Changi Airport. The ambiance is cozy and quiet as it is a very small restaurant, with only about 10 tables. It is a good idea to have a reservation. The service was very personal and attentive. The food was quite good in a city known for excellent cuisine. We had dinner with a friend who lives in Singapore who was familiar with the restaurant, and he recommended that the portions of the tasting menu were pretty large, so we ordered 3 of the tasting menus and 2 additional pasta dishes to share. The food was in general excellent and I particularly enjoyed the roasted red bell pepper in olive oil appetizer, spagetti carbonara, and the egg noodles with squid ink. The prices were reasonable. Overall, this would be a worthwhile place to visit for a meal. It is not easily accessible by subway, so car or cab ride will take about 30-40 minutes in weekend traffic from an area around Orchard
4
Portion of the food is quite generous though you pay slightly more. If you are a small eater, 1 serving is enough to share for 2.Food served at a timely order, so when you are done with your starters, main will be ready.Do call to reserve as seating is limited.Nice ambience.It is actually located very near Changi Airport with bus services 2,4 and 5 from Tampines and Pasir Ris MRT station. If you are taking cab, it is along the main road just opposite the Changi Women's Prison. Worth taking the time and effort to go there to try

I am Italian and I do not like to eat others' Italian cooking because it is never as good as my own or what can be had in Italy.Porta Porta is an exception. The bread is authentic Italian peasant bread with the crusty crust and chewy interior, brought to the table with olive oil and herbs or mushrooms. The spaghetti vongole is genuinely Italian in flavor with numerous baby clams and a tasty white wine sauce with subtle garlic. The minced meat rolls with mozzarella, the chicken rolls, tiramisu, grappa...all bring back many memories of my trips to Italy. I have eaten at Italian restaurants in San Francisco, Montreal, NYC, and Chicago, none excel more than Porta Porta. It us the closest true Italian cooking next to my grandmother. The owner'smother-in- law is Italian and the owner and family lived in Italy many years. It is a cozy, family setting with Italian memorabilia. Each time we dined there the tables were filled by 7 pm. Make reservations and be patient with service.Good homemade food cannot be rushed. Italian food should be made with love and Porta Porta serves it well!

My first visit to Porta Porta must have been somewhere in 2007 and the vongole was an absolute winner for me. And the thing is even after so many years they still serve such delicious vongole in this quiet corner of Singapore. It always gives me that homely feel, nice peaceful with food for the soul. I mean sure there are many Italian restaurants in Singapore but not many I can claim to remember a particular dish except for Porta Porta. They do serve a decent variety of other dishes and are tasty as well. They have got a "Fai Te" (hope i got that right) which is sort of let the chef decides and it is a really worth it deal and a sumptuous spread. But like i said earlier... for me the winner is the vongole
5
I've been patronising Porta since 2007. This is my absolute favourite restaurant, not only because it serves the best vongole in the world, but Rosi and Danesh are now like family to me and my friends. The warmth and love in Porta makes it such a wonderful place that none can compare. It's my little sanctuary when I need comfort food, even my surprise birthday party last year was held there :) absolute love :
5
We are Americans visiting Singapore for the first time. What a wonderful treat we found at Porta Porta. Our friends had lunch here and insisted we join them for dinner. They were certainly right. We have been to Italy many, many times and found this restaurant brought back many wonderful memories. Perfect pasta, terrific rosemary chicken, and a very happy and proud family make this a real gem. Small, intimate, and very friendly. Just trust the staff for recommendations or tell them what you want and it will magically appear. Who would believe an authentic Italian kitchen in the center of Chinatown and Singapore
4
Was recommended this restaurant by friends and I must say it is a great find. Tucked away in a Changi, the restaurant serves one of the best Italian food in Singapore and this is verified by my Italian friends. You should try their vongole...it is really worth dying for...not forgetting the black ink squid pasta. Simply Mama Mia
5
My family and i are regular customer at porta porta, and we always enter from the kitchen. We never had a rude remark from the kitchen staff whenever we enter the kitchen. You must have gone to the wrong restaurant! By the way, their last orders are at 9.00 pm!
5
I was introduced to this little restaurant by a friend of mine. We went for a working lunch. The restaurant is very inconspicuous - you almost need to look out for it amongst the numerous other outlets on Stanley Road. Inside it is decorated to make you feel like you are sitting in an old alleyway in Italy (complete with clothes hanging out to dry). The restaurant was quiet when we were there. The service was very attentive and most friendly.There are three set lunch options (meat, sea food and vegetarian) for very reasonable prices. Of course there is also a la carte if you wish. My friend had the sea food and I had the meat. Soup followed by pasta preceded a rosemary chicken dish. Dessert and coffee are both included. The quantities are well measured. So you are full but not so that you would need to lie down. The quality was truly lovely. I measure Italian restaurants by the quality of their pasta. My spaghetti with tomato sauce was superb.This is a little haven right in the centre of the CBD. My next visit there will be to try it out for an evening meal. Something to look forward to
5
Been there several times for lunch, no problem walking through their kitchen. No frill service but prompt and polite.A warm cosy place serving heart warming Italian food that soothe not only your taste buds but your soul - therapeutic if you want a breather from office stress
4
One of the secret of East Singapore, not advertised but only by word of mouth. We love it there for not having any menu, just tell the wait staff your choice of Beef/Chicken/Fish for main. Then the food starts coming, dishes after dishes and your main.I feel at home, like being invited to a family meal time !
1
the only 2 times i went to the restaurant with my wife for dinner, we were turned away because they say they were closing... at 9.30pm??? and the carpark was at the back of the restaurant so when we asked if we could walk thru the kitchen, the answer was a rude NO!!!1st impressions like that i'd rather not even taste their food even if they begged me... CRAP!!
4
Serves authetic italian food complete with the fizzy drink which is the only italian thinggi that i don't like...The service is great! And the starter platter a must have if u're two to share. I highly recommend the pasta.. Esp the mussle pasta in olive oil...Reservations highly recommended and parking can sometimes be a problem
5
Eat there almost every month.taste is an individual thing.we personally luvvvvvv porta porta because it's cozy,not too many tables,family run and the taste is so unlike big Italian restaurants.I can't put the taste in words.fresh ingredients,not can.....just like eating in an Italian home cook meal.as for the price,yes,porta charges a little bit more but it is worth it if you love the taste.as for us,we've never look at the price as we've found our little Italian food haven.....my 5 year old craves for their calamari,me,the vongole....this is us,like I said,taste is subjective.no harm trying!u may just love it too;
