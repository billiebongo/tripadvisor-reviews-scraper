We enjoyed reasonably priced set meals of eel plus tempura and Waygu beef grilled by the chef behind the counter. Both meals came with rice, broth and various pickles with a plate of watermelon to finish. Very tasty

Had lunch with my colleagues at Nanbantei at Chinatown Point, service was so so but food was really good. Due to lunch time crowd, we had a really rushed lunch as the service staff kept rushing us as we made the wrong reservation.

The food was great with good service.
Waitresses were attentive and friendly.
