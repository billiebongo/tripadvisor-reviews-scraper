A great homemade food, with fresh juice! So far the best food I've tried at Singapore. The staff are lovely and restaurant is very cozy!

Best lunch we had in Singapore so far. All natural, no white sugar. Even the juices were great! The restaurant is small, but very cozy. Love it!

I've been here a couple of times recently to try the smoothies. A reasonable selection of quite healthy products. Service can be a little slow but the end product is good. Located right in the centre of the action along Haji Lane.

Breakfast as early as 830am along Haji lane is rare. This was the only one opened and its Halal! EVERYTHING was yummy and definitely cooked with love. Theres even a breastfeeding room for moms. Safe haven for families. No preservatives, no processed sugar.

A lovely place for a home-cooked meal and freshly squeezed juices (we had delicious pomegranate). It is very much a casual, family place, with just a few tables and a very friendly service. There were babies and (well-behaved!) children own the premises, and so we had a feeling that we were not customers but visitors sitting at their kitchen table. A very pleasant moment during our visit to Haji Lane, and will definitely be back next year
