I havent tried this in awhile. And when i t. i must say it still tastes superb. The portions of cuttlefish, kangkong and pineapple are generous. Its a filling meal all by itself. Oh, dont forget to try the Cheng Teng next door. On a hot day, nothing tastes better than a cold Cheng Teng..The portions are generous with the right amount of sweetness..Have one today..Oh and dont stop at one..I didnt.

I could eat this ....everyday!Happened to be passing by and decided to drop-in, as it has been a looooong while eating this dish. Well, I m on a non-carbs diet. If you walk around any hawker Center, you will be hard-pressed to find a non-carbo dish. This cuttlefish kangkong is the answer ! And it is heavenly !! Check out the Cheng Tng stalk next door too!

I regret to say that the standard has dropped after Andrew the owner passed away. It was unfortunate. The ingredients decreased in volume, the ice increased in quantity and the taste was not as good as before. If Andrew was around, I would give it an excellent rating. The dessert has 11 different ingredients concocted with soups from 2 different troughs. The combination makes for a very tasty and special Cheng Teng that has lasted 3 generation
