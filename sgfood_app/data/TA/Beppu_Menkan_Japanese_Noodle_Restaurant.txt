Stopped here for lunch and really enjoyed the Ramen. Especially the broth was delicious! The staff was friendly and se had a nice chat with them. Would suggest this for a lunch or an casual, cheap dinner.

If you looking to go for real nice authentic ramen then I would not bother coming here. The menu has more than just noodles - but they are the "speciality" here. Try somewhere else.

Visited here on recent trip to Singapore- just looking for somewhere quick and reasonably priced. Didn't disappoint, staff very friendly and helpful and excellent quick service.

I go there over the last 10 years at least once a month, since the first time I am still drooling for the #18, the famous spicy fried chicken ramen. What is so yummy is their ramen soup certainly but what really worth it is the fried chicken, so crispy, so meaty and the best not oily at all, still wonder how they do it ? Sometimes one but sometimes some competition with fiends and go up to 6 . For those who think can handle spicy ramen, come here and you will really challenge yourself what you can really handle. Honestly, above 2 itâ€™s already unusable especially for non south East Asian folks. Try also the potato fried with crab sauce, I like it. No doubt go for it.

I went for lunch with colleagues. Most of the ramen bowls have the option of varying amounts of chilli, from 1 to 9. One chilli is hot, and no-one on our table had more than 3 chillis, even those very used to spicy food. You have been warned

Busy restaurant spot in a busy part of town, with many urban professional lunch time patrons. This place happened to be the favorite of my lunch guests. We has extra eggs, soursop and a teriyaki chicken to fill out the menu for 5. total tab 111 SN

This continues to be one of the places that always seems to be popular, but always worth the visit. If you like your noodles spicy, you're not gong to beat this place, as they offer most ramen dishes with the soup strength to your liking, on a chili range of 1, 2, 4, 6 or 8 chilies, and now they offer a white chili option. The white chili is a little peppery, and comes with the same strength options on most dishes.Freeflow hot and cold tea are available, along with ice water to help you through the chilies. If you've proven your abilities with 8 chilies and would like to push yourself a little further, chef can be encouraged to prepare your meal with 10 chilies

You can choose the spiciness of your ramen soup ranging from non-spicy to super HOT. A usually go for level 4 and consider myself a very good chili eater. You can request up to Level 10 or 12, good luck to you.. :). The Chicken Karage which I usually order has always been consistently good and so has the rest of the menu items. Although I don't work in the area anymore, I will still make a trip here once a month for my spicy ramen fix

I was intro to this place by a mutual fren. At my first glance, what Japanese but I cant take raw food?. As saying goes Don't judge by the look...it was really a heaven for me and I became the regular diner (atleast twice in a month).I was there again yesterday to intro to my new collegues and they love them too.My fav /Signature dish ramen with crispy chicken (some okino something, sorry never get the name) with 1 or 2 chilly.You can choose how spicy you want (don't go more then 4 chilly unless u love spicy).The lady boss yesterday intro us with white paste curry but I n my frens still prefer the authentic one (red curry soup). This goes well with free flow of their Japanese tea served either hot or cold.I would say its a must try food which gave me the confidence that I can survive in Japan with this type of foods
