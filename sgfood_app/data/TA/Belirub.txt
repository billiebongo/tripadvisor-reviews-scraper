The food is prepared meticulously, skilfully, and gently by the one-man-show chef who trained at Le Cordon Bleu in Texas, USA. He is passionate about his food preparation, and also excels in service!! He checks in with us when he's not too busy. He also is very nice and patient, and accommodates when we ask for less salt. He is proud of his food, and rightfully so, freshly prepared, without MSG. I loved the fries, aglio olio (angelhair!!), fish and chips (batter is so light and perfect!), grilled chicken, cajun chicken, multi-layered potato gratin, and the mixed cooked veggies was in a super yummy sauce too! We loved everything we ordered. For around $6 per dish, fantastic quality! The Chef even does his own dishes because he likes them squeaky clean!! Kudos to him
