Kopi Tiam is a great place to bring foreign friends to for a posh taste of local food. Some dishes are a hit, like their curries. And portions tend to be big
3
Had the tauhu telor, which tasted like it was deconstructed. It's hard to find good tauhu telor, and this one certainly isn't. My companion's rice dish was so-so. Maybe some of the other dishes on the menu are better. Hopefully.
3
Lunch crowd can be noisy and a bit slow at the restaurant. Served mostly local cuisines at a slightly higher price.
4
This is an excellent place to try different local dishes. Food is delicious and good portion size for sharing. Service is friendly too.
4
It is a good idea to have special dishes in December. Must try the delicious pumpkin butter tiger prawns!
4
It was very packed for a Monday night. The staff were working at full capacity, but managed to keep up with the pace. Kopi Tiam mimics the traditional coffee shop dining atmosphere, but with a modern flair. The selection of dishes was pretty decent, and coupled with the Lunar New Year special menu, I was spoilt for choice. For the price, you can sample large portions of local delights to share with your dinner party. I certainly hope that Kopi Tiam will refresh their menu a little more often to introduce different Singapore dishes once in a while

2nd time here. In my booking I requested a quiet corner as this is half-business-half-gathering lunch, we got a quiet corner by ourselves. The food took quite awhile because our boss was not around and we requested to serve food first and louhei later. Later our boss came and we requested the louhei to be served (since the food hadn’t arrived yet) and Daniel the manager (my guess) used a stuck-up face to attend to us. My colleague asked if we could serve the louhei but was totally ignored by him. What a bad attitude. But later when he served us the louhei and helped us with the cleaning and pouring of ingredients - these somehow helped I guess? I’ve never came across a waiter like him. We don’t completely want to complain his service because he still helped?! Duh. The food was good overall. Enjoyed my lunch
4
Good selection of local food, taste pretty good in general and fantastic service. Curry fish head was tasty but also fishy, it was replaced by another fish dish after I spoke with our waiter. Good location and fine ambience. Of course it is much more expensive than hawkers, but you get what you pay for. Will defined return again.
2
Location is very bad, hidden behind Swiss Cafe and no direction anywhere in Raffles City to guide customer. When I called the staff for help, the staff could not even tell me that it is just behind Cafe Swiss but gave complex instructions that took me 15mins walking all around on 2nd floor before finding it. If not because I had a foreign friend with me who wanted to taste a range of local cuisine, I would not have bothered. I ordered the 'Taste of Singapore' menu that cost $45 for 2 pax. The quantity were so small for the price we paid. The bak kut teh was nothing like bak kut teh. The ginger, chilli and black sauce was like for 2 bowls full than for the one spoonful serving of chicken rice.
4
Kopitiam is a great showcase for tourists who wants to try local food without the dangers of poor imitations or quality. The food served is generally representative in taste to what is termed local ethnic cuisines: Malay, Chinese, Indian in a restaurant setting. The servings are small though for the price, but that's probably to be expected due to its location: a restaurant within a 5-star hotel
5
Jayden, Siew May, Dinesh and Dee - 6 stars service.
Compliments to the Chef and team. We had chicken satay,popiah, nasi lemak, nasi goreng & tauhu telor - excellent.
1
The standard and quality of this restaurant had fallen drastically. The high prices that they charges for local fares is really not worth it as the taste is not up to standard at all
4
Laksa is overated for it signature. The oysters omelette is fantastic and generous. The chilli crab can be improved. Crispy fried rice is good.
5
Not my first time here but the quality and taste of the food always seems like my first time. Always tasty.
I have to say it is an expensive local food fare but worth for the quality and service.
4
Glad to see the new menu with more food choices. Maybe can consider deploy more staff so that service can be faster during lunch hours.
3
Food was ok but laksa was a bit toooo salty. The stingray and salted egg calamari were really good! Food portions were really big!
2
On our last night in Singapore, a senior colleague wanted to try laksa so we came here. I had a nonya chicken curry - very greasy, overly fragranced but not tasty at all. I was really disappointed in the food, this was the worst meal we had our whole time in Singapore
3
Food was clean. i mean... really clean... which is good. Flavour was great! Food quantity ... not so... may want to increase more quanity & quality? Went to another restaurant after coz quanity wasn't enough after ordering 3 mains & 1 app for 2 pax....... Also, they are very shorthanded. wish they are more prompt in clearing plates. otherwise we have to pile up dishes, making space in order to eat comfortably.
2
Stayed at Swissotel and have a 2 opportunities to have a breakfast here, either at the Cafe Swiss or Kopi Tiam. Forget Cafe Swiss, the queue is longer than Nile river. So I took both days at Kopi Tiam. Nothing spesial here, food variations is as standard as 3 star hotels. Taste is not better than the food hawkers around Singapore. The worst is the coffee. I am not sure what kind of coffee beans this resto used. One thing for sure, I will not drink my morning coffee from this Kopi Tiam no more
3
The food was quite tasty and service generally attentive. We has asked for a quiet location as we are a group of old friends looking forward to a good catch-up. While we are placed at a nice corner table, they also put a party of 10-12 people with 3-4 rowdy kids right next to us (celebrating a birthday). We don't blame the group (we are happy for them) but I wonder why the restaurant put us together so inconsiderately. We had already settled when the noise started to we did not ask to be moved which may also offend the other group. As a feedback, I hope the restaurant can be more considerate in the future.
5
My overseas guests enjoyed the local cuisine especially the Tahu Telor and Chendol.
Showed off the Singapore food galore - from Hainanese Chicken Rice, Char Keow Teow, Fried Carrot cake, etc ... topped off with four local desserts.
Well done, Kopi Tiam.
4
We had the yummy curry fish head, ayam panggang and sambal kangkong. The only gripe I have is that the air-conditioning wasn’t strong enough.
4
This is one of the go-to places to bring foreign friends to try local food in air-conditioned comfort. The menu is fairly extensive, and the quality of the ingredients is good. The food is not as tasty (and cheap) as good hawker fare though!
5
Jayden is an excellent service staff. Friendly, patient, efficient and courteous. 6 star service.
Chef can improve on Hokkien mee which has no "wok mei". Too wet. Prawn mee soup has insufficient prawn taste.
Thanks
5
I recently stayed at the Swisshotel stamford in singapour and was very well looked after by the restaurant manager. Unfortunately I did not make a note of his name. I can be difficult at time and despite this, he changed my order to something more convinient for me to eat. I would recommend Kopi Tiam for genuine singaporian cuisine
3
Very hard to get the attention of the wait staff. We had to try several times and the restaurant had only a few tables which are occupied. The fish head curry was bland and had two half slices of brinjal and two half slices of lady's fingers. The good thing is the fish was plentiful. The oyster omelette was too starchy.
4
I dine regularly at Kopi Tiam, I really feel that it gives me a better dining experience, from the culinary perspective. The taste is generally the same, but the quality of the products and the method of preparation are superior.Service was subpar this visit as the waiters were either new or poorly trained. They group together chatting throughout my 90mins dinner. One waiter really got me puzzled for awhile due to communication barrier. I asked him what the nut-cracker was for, as the crabs served were supposed to be shelled. His response was "yes the crabs are shelled but if you want it more shelled, so you can use this". So I asked him, "so are the crabs shelled or are they not?". We went back and forth a couple more times before I realised that he did not know what shelled means. Instead of saying he did not understand, he used the word like he knows it and created confusion
4
On our first night in Singapore we were kind of restricted as to where we could go to eat so resorted to one of the hotel restaurants. We were both pleasnatly surprised by the quality of food and by the service. Staff were helpful and attentive giving advice when appropriate. Food was very tasty and not too pricey considering it was a hotel. Happy to recommend this restaurant
3
As I tend to have lunch quite often at the restaurant (more for convenience) until couple of months ago, I am have increasingly disappointed by the quality of service. Whereas the food quality is only average, the level of service made up for it, until recently. So, unless you are desperate, you will end up feeling like a fool...
3
Erratic food quality. The seafood hor-fun was excellent but the fish porridge set was sub-par as the braised chicken served by the side was not good. Since it is fish porridge, it would have better to give more fish slices than to serve chicken on the side
3
Not enough staff and service was non existent.. could never get a wait staff. .. mains were so so but the desserts were good ....
5
Good food with excellent service. I am a repeated customer and will definitely return again. Thank you!
1
Food is below average ... some dishes are horrible.
Service is slow due to lack of staff. Unable to cope with the crowd.
The worst is a captain/manager, Chinese, fat, short. His service attitude is not suitable to be in the service industry.
5
As usual, enjoyed good foods and services. My best place to entertain visitors for local dishes. Curryfish head. Lojak, chicken rice, sambal kangkong, claypot dishes, noodles etc.
3
Food is good but not excellent. Portion is very generous for some of the dishes. Nice view and ambience. Wouldn't be my choice if there's no promotion.
4
Food was good we ordered assam fish, daily veg dish and ma po tofu. Just a little fishy smell tasted of the assam fish wish it hadn't been given this was a high end restaurant. Food are slightly overpriced for certain dishes. There was dinner crowd on a Thursday though
3
Local Singapore restaurant. Curry fish head taste all right but the fish head had no meat. Mostly bones ! Rojak is below average compare to other Singapore restaurant. Teh Tarak is not hot enough. It's lukewarm. Chendol is average. The service is average. Lots of room to improve.
3
Order curry fish head , rojak and chen doll. Curry fish head hardly any fish meat. Mostly fish head bones. The style of the rojak is below expectation. It's not as good as previous rojak. Chendol is ordinary. No much to comment. Servers are below average. Services can greatly improved. Especially service with a smile.
4
So I went on 28 July, Friday. As I dine there fairly frequently as a FAR Card member, I noticed that even though there were many more people than usual (I normally go between tuesdays and thursdays) the number of staff on duty did not rise accordingly. This led to some rather overworked staff as I noticed one person had to handle around 2 sections on average. That said, the food was excellent as usual, and my dining companions and I wish you could add the claypot rice to the permanent menu. :
2
Lack the usual service standard they used to possess. 1st impression at level 1 entrance very bad. No greetings. Just point direction to ascent by lift without informing which floor. When asked, extremely hostile. When arrived at 2nd entrance, recep wasn't aware we had a reservation made. We usually spend around $150 per person at equinox. Not expecting such rude service. Will not invite any guest to this place. Bad 1st impression, not going to help seal any Deals here..
3
Their portions seem to be getting smaller even though the prices remain the same. :( They seem a little short on staff during peak lunch hour too.
1
Food standard and quality have dropped. . Restaurant charges 5 times more than food courts or hawker centres. The dishes we had were very salty considering the drive by our society to lower sodium intake.
4
The food was great and the place was nice to hang out in. Service was quick. It was after our prompting that the service staff advised us on the credit card promotion. We will go back again.
5
Ordered fish head. Daniel served us and his service was excellent! I would definitely return for a meal again!
4
Had lunch there with my wife and friends. The menu is rich in local specialties. The food was very delicious and the service was very good. The restaurant is a bit pricy. So, if you are staying at the Swissotel or the Fairmont, ask the if there are any discounts for guests. We stayed at the Swissotel and got a 30 % discount which made the lunch really affordable.
5
Brought our relatives from Medan for dinner at Kopi Tiam and enjoy the food and milk tea (teh tarik).Must eat is the Singapore famous chilli crab and buns (we had two servings). Others include nasi goreng istimewa with satay, fried kway teoh, hainanese chicken rice, fish head curry with crackers and ayam satay (peanut sauce) and ice kacang.We recommend you come and take a family photos at the entrance with the Kopi Tiam signboard and for younger persons take a photo next to the trishaw. Relived the nostalgia of the bygone days
3
food is a bit disappointing as i believe the beef rendang has changed which is not really the authentic rendang. assam fish is a little disappointing, i feel the presentation could have been better like serving the fish in a claypot/stoneware than on a serving plate.
4
Used to work at Raffles City over 20 years ago and would always take overseas friends to Kopi Tiam as a first introduction to Singapore food. Food is good although the price is no longer as affordable. Service is still friendly but alas, service staff are no longer as attentive and quick to respond.
4
Very comprehensive menu, however price was on the steep side. The huge portion and quality of food kinda justify the price. The restaurant setting evokes nostalgia which contrasts with the modern city scape view of the exterior. Good to visit if you want to sample local fares under one roof and don't have the time to visit hawker centres.
5
Singapore has some of the best food in the world. Spicy, fragrant, and full of flavor while maintaining a simple and rustic style. Kopi Tiam is a local hotel-affiliated restaurant in the Raffles City complex/mall, so I was legitimately shocked when it turned out it had fantastic food. I usually stay at an adjacent hotel (Fairmont), and I always eat here near the beginning of my trip, then I feel a little guilty because I end up eating here a 2nd time (with so many amazing food choices in Singapore, eating at any place twice in the same visit may seem silly!) Kopi Tiam has excellent curries, oyster omelets, beef rendang, and a special mention for the fish head curry. This is a wonderful way to experience Singaporean and Indian cuisine
3
Standard drop so much that the fish head curry I ordered was not fully cooked.
Service is also below average as they are TOP busy and too little service staff.
Can skip.
3
Ordered Rojak. Doesn't taste as good as before, they seem to have change the receipe. Nasi lemak was good though.
2
Always ordered the hokkien mee/noodles when I'm there,today portions dropped, 3 prawns and 3 tiny squid and it costs me $18. Ordered the oyster omelette as well, tasted horrible with small tiny oysters.
4
I would prefer the curry fish head to be more spicy and more vegetables. Will definitely visit again.
3
Nice eating place with friends. Served a variety of local dishes. Central location near MRT and many shopping Malls.
4
Service was prompt and always consistent. Though the hawkerfare cost 4 times but portion v generous. Love the oyster omelette, beef rendang, tauhu telok n curry fish head.
4
Asian local cuisine. Yummy. Guest chef dishing out Sing style cuisine. love the stingray, laska. good effort.
5
One of the best restaurant that caters Local Singaporean cuisine especially the Singaporean Chilli Crab. Food was cooked to perfection. Very attentive staff very courteous that would add to your culinary experience attention to details. We were given an apron so you wont stained your attire for the evening. The sauce was so good that you can lick with your fingers. Suggested dish includes the Fish head curry to pair with the Chilli Crab cooked by a local expert. An special offer applies when you booked at the Swissotel The Stamford. What a dinner to remember
2
Not wanting to travel far from where we were, we decided to try Kopi Tiam's rendition of local food.Business was average for a weekend night. The place is dated & had a dingy ambience. The reception received from the chinese male captain in black jacket was less than basic : no courtesy greeting & he was so unmotivated to even speak in complete sentences in response to our enquiry!For a $20 item, the seafood horfun had miserable portions of seafood : 2 prawns, a penny sized scallop & incomplete morsels of fish. We had to cancel an appetiser as it was totally dry & tasteless
3
Tends to be crowded so made table reservation in advance. This time I was disappointed that they could not locate my Chope online reservation. Fortunately, they were able to locate an available table. Not a wide range but adequate representation of local favourite food. One of the few restaurant that serves Teh Tarik, a floamy milk tea beverage.
3
Prior to my reservation, the system generated several reminders periodically, some of which had my surname wrong. Staff was pleasant. Food can be improved (e.g. Popiah). Prices are on the high side for hawker fare.
4
We like to bring our guests from out of town here. Its a one stop shop so our guests get to try all the local food in one sitting.
3
The salted egg yolk crab was fried before stirred fried with salted egg yolk. Quite a challenge to eat the crab as the inner shell (white) broke off easily. Perhaps the crab could be steamed instead of fried.
4
They had a good set of stalls. I had Hainanese chicken curry. That was good, And some chendol. very good. Fast service, decent price, good seating. better than hawker center comfort. no crowds.
4
Service was rather slow on that day despite very few customers present. Food took quite awhile to come as well.
5
brought my australian colleague to this restaurant twice, local food at reasonable price, nice view too
4
Never fails to disappoint, quality of food is good although the taohu telok is a tad too sweet. Could lighten up on the sweetness. Portions are generous.
4
👍good effort in local cuisine. Love the fish head curry. Great view of the CBD. Good for family outings too.
4
I have been coming here for the past 10 years. The food may be pricey considering we can get the same at cheaper prices at hawker centres but the premium prices are made up by the ambience, quality ingredients and good service!I was able to comfortably bring my son here for meals since he was a baby and he is already 10 years old. I never hesitate to find an opportunity to come her
4
If not sure what you might want in terms of local, oriental food, this place provides some variety without being too difficult for a beginner. The food was fine without being spectacular and the service was attentive. We had a nice table by the window which was nice for our first evening in Singapore. The drinks were expensive compared to neaby bars
5
Table was by the window (thank you). The curry was a large serving with a meaty fish head that was so fresh. However we felt the AC was a little warm that day.
5
Overall food was tasty and sufficient but food was not very hot when served . Total service was good. Thanks.
4
Served nice local food. However, the restaurant tends to be noisy when crowded which could be due to the interior structure.
5
Heard great raves about the fish head curry and came down to try using the Amex 50% off deal for 2pax. It was so satisfying deliciously!
5
Love their cod fish, carrot cake (white), curry fish head n Teh Gao (Tarik) Must try! Service staff are attentive when not crowded.
3
Good Hawker food served in a restaurant setting. Place was crowded and busy so service was rushed. Could be too noisy for those who wanted a quieter place for dinner.
4
Its quiet during weekdays. Perfect if you prefer some time being alone. Price wise on the high side but quaity of food is not bad.
3
I went to this restaurant twice within a week. The first visit was delightful though the servers seemed mildly distracted. We assumed that it was because we were the first to arrive.On the second visit water was not served despite several attempts. The food came out cold and the waiter seemed to have completely forgotten about us. I was rather disappointed
3
As we were limited in time, we decided to eat at this restaurant before my friends embarked on their cruise. The ambiance was good, but was I surprised at the very high prices. Yes, it's in a hotel, but it was way, way too expensive! I will not recommend any tourist friends to go there. Food was also rather bland
3
Food was average. Nothing to wow about. Was expecting something better but was disappointed. The kang Kong was not even near to the great taste of some hawker center. Laksa was not hot but rather lukewarm. Prawn paste chicken was ok as the taste is not strong enough. Overall could be better for a high end hotel. I've been to a lower end hotel for similar dishes and it tasted much better. Hope they can improve their standard.
5
Great atmosphere, excellent service and delicious food. All the great flavours of a hawker market in lovely surroundings. Perfect !
3
Service needs improvement. Asked for recommendations but waiter unfamiliar. Got the impression that waiters are part timers,untrained
5
Good value for money. i found the ambience and the food was nice. the crab and rabbis especially were tasty
5
Booked Via ChopeSG!
Paid via Amex Platinum card, 1for1 offers! Super deal!
Food is good! And Service is excellent!
4
Overall service was good. But the claypot beef with Ginger and Onions were average, should have ordered from the A La carte menu.
4
The menu has a great variety and the souffle is a must try. Tried the chocolate souffle and it really melts in the mouth. However it is very crowded especially during the dinner time, hence it's recommended to make a reservation. Due to the restaurant being crowded, my friend and I were sort of asked by the staff to pay the bill immediately after we had finished our meals
4
The food is good and flavourful, albeit expensive, if there are no discounts applicable. And while hawker fare is much cheaper, the quality and quantity in this restaurant goes some way in making the pricing more palatable. Overall a good place to bring visitors who may be concerned about eating in a hawker centre environment
3
This restaurant is part of the Swissotel and advertises itself as a Singapore Restaurant. I am sure that the menu does offer authentic dishes but not sure if they are authentic in terms of flavour. Curry I had was fairly bland.Service was first class and for an in house hotel restaurant it was very good value
3
Service was quick but the food was very average. When the waiter put down my plate of food his thumbs were really far onto the plate - something I personally can't stand (get your hands off my plate please). The price was cheaper than some others nearby, but there are better places to eat than here. I also thought the restaurant lacked atmosphere.
4
Kopitiam is not your usual place to grab a piece of Singapore's gastronomic experience. You can probably get a better deal at the Hawker centres. But if you are a little far away and in need of a relatively better ambience, this is the place to do it. I usually meet people here so this is a pretty good place, not too formal but also not too hawker centre style and the 50% off on FAR dining privileges is great
1
The laksa was insipid. The Claypot chicken and rice was terrible. It took us 15 mins of being seated to get a servers attention.
4
I always enjoy eating here, be it with friends or family. There is something for everyone in the menu.
The tahu telur and ice kachang are consistently tasty.
5
Ate as a family and we got a range of food, Singapore chilli crab, chicken, satays and more. Crab was great lots of nice meat and a good crab. For deserts we had Pisang Goreng which we also really good.
4
Treated to dinner at Kopi Tiam by a Singaporean friend who ordered for us and picked out some really tasty local dishes. We were there quite late (sat down at 9.30) on a Sunday night so the place was empty apart from us - they stayed open just for us I think. Good service, very tasty food, good local experience. Imagine it would be really good when full of people and a bit of buzz going on
5
We had a pleasant lunch at Kopi Tiam where we sampled several yummy items. I would recommend the carrot cake and laksa from what we had. It is a a little pricey but if you have the discount it's much more reasonable. Overall nice casual family lunch restaurant
4
Kopi Tiam at the Swissotel The Stamford offers excellent food in very pleasant surroundings. Certainly an asset to the hotel.I ate some of their Clay Pot specialities and they were delicious.Would definitely eat there again if and when in Singapore.Very attentive service and take good care of the hotel guests
4
When in a foreign country we like to try the local dishes. Found this restaurant , staff were very helpful , explaining the different dishes we had ordered on the set menu. It was very nice but not my favourite . Service was good , our bill was about the same as we would pay at hom
3
Brought a German visitor for some Singaporean food at Kopi Tiam on a Monday afternoon. We were given a table by the window with a nice view of the war memorial and Singapore Recreation Club. We ordered rojak, devil's curry and crab meat fried rice. The rojak was excellent while the curry and fried rice was average. The portions were generous and sufficient for two. The staff were attentive and helpful. The only negative factor are the prices. Our bill for the two of us, including two soft drinks, was over SGD80
1
Very slow service when the restaurant is not even half filled. Had to call for the bill thrice before I finally get to sign it, and they take at least 30mins for the food to be served. And the food itself isnt that tasty.. Not something I will expect from a restaurant under Swissotel.
4
For tourists, this is a good place to sample Singapore's famous local dishes and hawker fare in comfortable surroundings, without the heat and humidity of hawker food centres. All the local favorites such as laksa, Hainanese chicken rice, fried Kway Teow and hor fun are available here. You pay more ($16 to $22 mostly) but they are bigger portions with more ingredients, yet authentic enough. We tried the laksa, fried Kway Teow and beef tenderloin with rice. All pretty good especially the first two. You can sit near the windows with a nice view of the esplanade park and the traffic. Service was good. As we were staying at the Fairmont, we got a 30% discount by charging it to our room. They also have a 50% discount promotion for AMEX platinum card holders till the end of 2016.
3
Tried the Singapore style fish head curry. It was ok but not impressive.
Resturant was comfortable but quite noisy such that we were not able to really chat. Could do with some sound absorbers.
3
Was abit disappointed with this restaurant. Came for breakfast buffet, however the selection was very limited and all contenital. Only came to realise that the restaurant has another buffet section, which we weren't told about towards closing time.
4
nice, bright and good view to stadium place for a lunch meeting. good local food. The only thing to be improved is too few waiters for lunch time.
3
Foods generally good and more of a high end eatery compared to food court but price expensive and can be quite noisy. Will only dine with the 50% discount.
3
This restaurant serves local food in a comfortable setting. The kind of place that tourist would go to try local dishes without venturing into a hawker center. Be prepared to pay at least $20 for each serving
3
We decided to lunch here as we were having seminar upstairs and could not afford to go too far for lunch. The place was packed, but we were smoothly showed to a table at the back of the restaurant. The menu was consisted of local cuisine, with the place decorated with old school chairs and tables. Thus its name Kopi Tiam. Fashioning it after the traditional coffee shop.Capitol Pork Ribs ($22++)pork ribs, sweet and sour sauceThe dish was served with a plate of plain rice. The serving was huge. The pork rib was tender but lacked of the crispiness which I preferred.Beef Rendang ($22++)spiced beef, kaffir lime leaves, coconut milkThe dish was served with a plate of plain rice. The beef was tender and well flavoured. The gravy was rich and creamy, which went very well with the plain rice.Crispy Bean Curd - Teuhu Telur ($16++)deep-fried bean curd, bean sprouts, eggs, peanuts, sweet and sour sauceI was surprised at the size of the serving. Usually it was served as a single piece of bean curd, but here bean curd was cut into tiny pieces and deep fried, which made it easy to eat without tearing apart the bean curd. The sauce was surprising sweet, instead of the spicy sauce which I was expecting. Quite a delicious combination.As I was paying with AMEX credit card with FAR card benefits, there was a 50% discount when dining for 2 persons. It was quite good considering the huge servings of the dishes
4
Got a table for dinner without a reservation. Discount for Swissotel patrons. Satay sticks were delicious. Laksa nice and creamy with a good curry flavour. Mango pudding was excellent. Staff friendly and meals served quickly.
1
Had dinner here (ala carte) and I think this will be the last time. The soup and main course that we ordered was seriously salty. It's like a whole bag of salt was dumped in to the dishes!. It is not edible at all and spoil our taste buds the entire night. What's good was when we informed the staff, he immediately offered to re-do the dishes for us and apologize for the salty food. Kudos to Daniel for his great customer service!. He is definitely an asset for this establishment. I noticed that the the quality of food has deteriorated pretty badly based on the previous visits.I dont think I will dine here again. Location: Raffles Shopping Mall. Nearest MRT - City Hall MRT.If you think this review is useful, please do click on the "helpful" button. Thanks

We arrived at the Swiss The Stamford hotel close to 9pm hungry after a long trip from Australia. We looked around the food court but it was very busy, on Friday evening. We were very happy to be able to get a table at the Kopi Tiam restaurant. Service was impeccable and the food was amazing. We had Singapore Satay, Mee Goreng and Hainanese Chicken. Highly recommended!We loved the food so much that we ended up visiting Kopi Tiam again before departing Singapore
5
Our meal consisted of Pepper Crabs, Hainanese Chicken, Fried Baby Squids and Spicy Eggplant...all superbly served dishes and the tastes is nothing but delicious up to the last bite :-)The service was a bit dull because we arrived around 9:20 pm, a full hour before closing time. The staff were courteous and attentive. Since we were staying at the host hotel (Swissotel, The Stamford) where this restaurant is located on the 2nd floor, we were also treated to a 30% discount on food. Real treat for us, otherwise the crabs don't come cheap. We will definitely be back and try the other dishes on their menu...the next time we shall make it a point to reserve some space for dessert
4
Great variety of buffet food for breakfast. Great service, nothing too much ti trouble the staff here
5
the fish head curry is very good, the whole family loved it. a close second was the crispy sotong-thumbs up!
4
Porridge was fabulous, would be good to be able to order extra plain porridge to go with the side dishes.
5
liked the upmarket local feel of the restaurant. generous portions. service was mixed with one very friendly waitress and one very sullen waiter.
3
Am here at Kopi Tiam. Rather disappointed or maybe the choices we ordered are not popular. Anyway we ordered crab fried rice, wanton noodle soup, Penang style prawn noodle and Nasi goreng istimewa plus a dish of you tiao. All turned out so average and not that fantastic. For such prices, I think hawker food would taste better. :( Won't be back for certain.
4
Kopi Tiam is a nice, unpretentious place with a rural touch and very friendly service, quite diffrent from the western type hotel coffee shops. At lunch their menu has lots of interesting local dishes and they frequently have featured specials, like recently seafood. You can have very spicy dishes, if you like, but also more 'mellow' ones. The portions are reasonable in size and so are their prices. The occupation can be very different, sometimes booked to the gills and on other occasions quite empty, depending whether the Stamford Hotel hosts a major meeting on its 4th floor. I find the place very appealing for local food, both Singapore and Malaysian fares

I have never been so totally impressed by a hotel breakfast restaurant in my life!I actually decided to eat at kopi Tam for breakfast because I knew my colleagues would be in the European breakfast room and I wanted solitude.Well, did I make the right decision! Kopi Tam offered such a variety of food that any culture could be satisfied and the had an egg bar.Aside from the amazing food, the staff was equally, if not more amazing! The wait staff were efficient yet attentive and the hostess went above her duties. I ended up staying an extra week unexpectedly and the hostess knew my name / room number / #of people in my party by mid-trip. She even noticed that I didn't have a lot of time for breakfast every morning and gave me a bag of snacks. I'm sad that I don't remember her name, but if it weren't for the staff I would never have given a 5 (I don't give 5's often).Skip the Swiss breakfast and go to kopi tam

We have had breakfast in many 5 star hotels but Kopi Tiam has the best nasi lemak. The sambal has enough heat and topped with 2 sunny side eggs just yum! Every trip we stayed at the Swissotel, we look forward to Kopi Tiam. The cafe is vibrant and the staff very attentive. They are very friendly and service oriented! Whether the cafe is crowded or not, the staff always look to see if the tables need any further service or the plates to be cleared away. The atmosphere in Kopi Tiam is cozy and comfortable. The service great and the food spread is good quality! We always compare other hotel breakfast nasi lemak to this place

I came here with my mother and family to have lunch. We ordered rice dishes, for example, crab meat fried rice, claypot beancurd rice, ayam panggam and nasi briyani ismewati. As usual, the food quality does not disappoint. Dishes come fast, hot, and are delicious. My children can also finish their dishes on their own. Very satisfying meal indeed
5
I only had breakfast there almost every morning of my stay. The food was good but the reason for my review is the staff. Lady who takes our room numbers down just before entering the restaurant is very nice. I tried to catch her name but i keep forgetting it... She is very friendly, polite and welcoming. My boyfriend's and mine last names are impossible to pronounce for anyone but she tries and does it perfectly fine every single morning when she sees us. Last time i saw her working as a hostess by the door was the morning of 23rd march (maybe that will help management to understand which person i am talking about) . Thank you for your nice smile and making our mornings nice from the very start
4
Among the modern kopi tiam chains TB has the best kaya toast. Once the trays were stacked high and I knocked it spilling a whole cup of teh. They just cleaned up and gave me a fresh cup. No complaints, no fuss.
5
I went in for a breakfast buffet. The Place was packed mostly with stamford guests. It was good but not worth $45,which they charged us!!
4
It was great having breakfast here, Well the breakfast menu is same among all the restaurants in Swiss hotel. But I like this atmosphere here more than other restaurant to have breakfast
3
Been to this place many times but this is the first time I ordered Bak Kut Teh. The soup was so cold!
3
Had lunch at the fish soup stall at Kopi Tiam Plaza Singapura.
Ordered a bowl of fish soup together with a bowl of steamed rice.
Was still hungry after the meal as the quantiy of the ingredients were little.
4
For years I have been coming here for their Curry Laksa..& its a distinctive version not often found generally speaking...exceptionally creamy+ silky noodles , & with unusually good quality prawns along with the usual tofu,etc etc..priced at a slightly high $22++, it is so satisfying I believe its worth it!The environment is spacious & cool, a not unpleasant outlook with friendly staff & an unhurried atmosphere. You can however expect prompt service & thoughtful attention..not bad for an operation tucked away in a (you might imagine) forgotten corner of The Stamford Hotel~ but it's always busy & so their brand of Singaporean cooking obviously has a loyal & appreciative following. Warmly Recommended
3
Used to like this restaurant as they has roti prata many years ago. Now they do have Singaporean dishes which are OK, but one dish was cold and service was not up to standard. Considering that one can eat same dishes in Raffles city for a lot less money and freshly prepared, I would not recommend this restaurant. More tailored to tourists
4
Located within Swisshotel building is Kopi Tiam. Nice size restaurant with an amazing view of Marina Bay Sand. Lunch hour was hectic, good atmosphere and friendly staff. The price on the high side but serving is good portion so not bad. The menu catered for vegetarian, as well as festive menu, or traditional menu; which include local favorites, rice and congee, noodles, chicken curry weekly specials and soup (chef special is $13 and seafood broth is $18.Deserts are plenty to chose from( mango pudding $7 to ice kacang $10, all up 9 dishes)Beverages are extensive for local coffee and tea to juices and and alcoholic beverages (wines, beer and champagne, served in glass or bottle
4
My family and I were staying at Swissotel Stamford and decided to have lunch at Kopi Tiam in the premises. We found the menu very comprehensive and well thought out. The quality of the food was good and the taste fairly authentic. We found the Hainanese chicken rice and Penang Prawn Noodles worth ordering. The Bak Kut Teh was not to our liking, however. Prices are high for local dishes that can be found at most hawker centres or food courts. The great service, and comfortable, well-appointed surroundings could not quite justify the substantial premiums we were paying
4
Always a regular guest at Kopi Tiam at Swissotel and they never fail to live up to their service. They are famous for their curry fish head as the portion is good for 2 men or 3 ladies. Their fish head is always fresh and curry uses is assam curry! I always tell my guests, unless you have preference in food, you can always order anything and it's sure to be good
4
I have eaten here so many times, I practically have my own table. :) Nice array of Singaporean and other regional foods. My fallback is Nasi Goreng, but the Char Kway Teow is also very good.
4
Had lunch with friends. The staff were friendly and ambiance was pleasant. Food quality was ok except the curry fish head was not fresh but the restaurant did an exchange. Food taste was ok. Will return.
4
Nice coffee shop with more than coffee. Strategically located and nearby the swissotel that we stayed at
5
The staff of Kopi Tiam are very friendly. They are very patient in introducing me what's good in Singaporean food. I ordered Chicken rice and Bak Kut Teh. They are yummy.
5
Had dinner at Kopi Tiam, Swissotel The Stamford twice this week. The food was really delicious and not very oily or salty. Way above what I expected. I recommend the fried carrot cake, laksa and tahu telur. For any tourist who wants to try local favorite food, just go here. You can't go wrong
4
Have been a regular diner here as the Amex Platinum card offers a 50% off for 2 diners. In fact, it seems that every monday, there is an on going 50% discount for party of up to 5 pax for the Amex platinum members. Some of the better dishes that i have had -Beef rendang, Laksa, Fish head curry. Staff are generally prompt and polite. The teh tarik is smooth and flavorful, but the price seems a bit steep whereby you can have similar ones just at the basement of the shopping mall ( at probably 20% of it) A tip for Amex platinum or Far members ( the fish head curry is considered as 2 main dish that qualifies for the 50% dining benefit
4
Came here with a group of friends for dinner on a Friday evening. Right from the start, service was abysmal to say the least. It took ages to take our order and serve us, food came before we had plates and cutlery.... But I have to admit we ate everything we ordered and the food was pretty good and reasonably priced for a hotel restaurant.Personally I would have preferred that the food was hotter (temperature wise) but it seems to be the norm in Singapore that food does not always come piping hot, or even all together at the same time.An enjoyable evening with good food for a group of 7, but had we dined alone and waited so long for the order and food, I am sure we would have been very frustrated. The group conversation kept us all going whilst we waited over 30-40mins for the food to come
3
The service was disappointing as we had to wait for a long time for our food. The first 20 minutes we were left alone with no offer of water or table snacks. Subsequently we had remind the waiters to let us have cutlery. Food was pretty average. Will not go again.
3
A limited menu featuring some of the local fare of Singapore: Ok but not great. Chicken satay was mediocre but the prawn dish delivered a more interesting and satisfying meal. The clients seemed to be local families staying in the hotel looking for a quick meal. Singapore has beet food right outside the Hotel door
4
I always say to my friends and guests that any item you order from this menu never goes wrong. With the exception of personal preference, there is nothing in the menu that taste horrible or not up to standard.However, a must have when you are here is there Assam Fish Head in claypot! It is big enough feed 2 grown up men and up to 3-4 ladies, depending on the amount of intake. Next you should try their Nasi Istimewa
5
Handy to be able to charge you bill back to Fairmont or Stamford hotels. Good sie serves. Staff are friendly. Food is well cooked and served nicely.
5
We had the Fish Head Curry on our first night in Singapore here. Amazing. I didn't want to try it at first because of the actual fish head but my husband convinced me too and I am so glad he did as it was fantastic.
4
The outlet has a good menu, offering delicious local cuisine. Spoilt for choice with a great variety.
4
If you are a little confronted by Hawker Food Stalls, but want to taste delicious Singapore specialities, go here. Their Singapore laksa is wonderful, as is their spicy Eggplant.
Really good food.
4
A quiet place to enjoy sit down meal with your select group of firends or family...
offers truly authentic singapore local cuisine...
4
Local favourites like curry fish head, papadum, salted egg yolk with brinjal and chilli prawns. Not the cheapest in town but suitable environment for business and talk. The crowd was not too touristy nor rowdy. Great for small discussions with makan
4
One of the Restaurant that Belongs to the Hotel located at raffles city
Some of the Must try dishes: Chili crab (remember to ask for more gravy), Fried carrot cake, Deep Fried soon Hock (Fish) with Special black sauce etc.
4
I lost count of the number of times I have been to this place. It's not exactly the cheapest place to try Singaporean food, but to me, this is a good place to hang out and eat. I guess the quality of ingredients used could be one reason to justify the prices you will pay for the food.My favorite dishes will be the noodles and rice dishes, like fried rice, hokkien mee, and nasi padang. The portions are generous, so one can feel satisfied with eating one dish alone.Do try the local drinks as well - milo dinosaur is one drink my kids love very much. Bandung is another sweet drink you can consider too.Quiet and nice place to hang out with family or friends. Good service too
4
I guess this restaurant if meant for tourists and business travellers hence serving of local food at about 5-6 times the street price. For example, the fried radish cakes (carrot cake as the locals called it) cost $17++ a plate here while it costs $3 at most food centres.Of course, this is a restaurant.The meal cost the three of us slightly above $100.We shared a plate of fried carrot cake (black). It was tasty and had a few shrimps thrown in.My daughter had a bowl of prawn noodles soup, my wife had the Nonya curry chicken special (special because it is not on the regular menu) and I had the recommended local laksa.The taste was passable though my wife commented that the chicken was cooked separately from the curry (hence the curry flavour could not penetrate the flesh of the chicken).My daughter had aloe vera for dessert while my wife and I had fried banana fritters with ice-cream. I always ordered this dessert.Would I visit Kopi Tiam again? Probably.For the ambiance more than the food, of course. It is relaxing watching the world go by through the glass windows away from the heat

Despite its proximity to a major hotel and despite its convenience for those arriving from transoceanic flights, Kopi Tiam should be avoided. From the outset, the experience was rushed and intrusive; the pushy waiter opened the menus for us, flipped the page, and assertively pointed to dishes that we ought to take. When the victuals arrived, the main course that we had both ordered, a local version of a chicken curry, had slipped to a few degrees above room temperature despite being the sort of offering that should arrive at near-grill heat. During the ordering process, we were misled into thinking that we ought to order a vegetable dish. That dish, commanding a pricy fifteen Singapore dollars, turned out to be a lukewarm melange of cabbage and mushrooms with only the slightest soy sauce flavor--a flavor that, contrary to waiter advice, in no way coincided with the curry flavor profile but that, instead, suggested a damp towel headed for the laundry. When it was clear that the meal had misfired, the waiter appeared to apologize and to "comp" the disastrous vegetable dish, which was well and good, but the free dessert that he offered in reparation turned out to be the cheapest, most modest offering on the menu, which, to boot, was clumsily plated in an old-fashioned bowl that looked somewhat like a postwar emergency vessel and was topped with a dessicated strawberry. Local food at ten times the quality and at one-tenth the price can easily be found only a few steps away in the gigantic food complex underlying Raffles City. Take the elevator down to it and be happier than you would were you to visit Kopi Tiam
5
A giant bowl of mee / wanton soupl for S$3.00 - $3.50.
Fresh fruit juice, druit slices for your hotel fridge and breakfast or midnight snack.
Bras Basah Kopi Tiam......

Relatives from Singapore treated us there to enjoy the local food with Curry Fish, Tofu, eggs and many delicious Singapore local dishes. Would love to go back for more specialities,
3
Rather basic décor. The service was good. The food is Singapore Asian, quality good. Prices a little on the high side, but probably should expect that for a hotel restaurant.
5
Kopi Tiam is a favourite with locals as well, which is always a good endorsement. Always crowded, but always worth it. Service, like most places in Singapore, is superb.
4
Despite the fact that this is a hotel restaurant, most of the clientele seemed to be locals rather than hotel guests which is usually a good sign and definitely was in this case. Good choice of Singapore Asian favourites on the menu, which all seemed to be freshly cooked to order. It was the first night of our trip and we were tired from travelling but this was a good choice - really enjoyed it
3
Was staying at Swissotel Singapore on a business trip and happen to visit this restaurant. They serve breakfast at this place. While the restaurant was ok, the breakfast menu was not exhaustive and the place looked cramped for space.One needs to wait for around 10-15 min atleast to get a table at morning rush hours
3
Popped into Kopitiam yesterday evening for dinner. The restaurant serves a range of local fare including Singapore, Malaysian and Indonesian staples. I ordered the Nasi Goreng. I had visited the restaurant several times in the past and never been disappointed. But I have to say last nights offering was poor. The rice was dry and bland and almost inedible. This was accompanied by some fried chicken and a couple of sticks of satay. Prices are high ($18++) for what you get and the fact there is so much choice for better tasting food nearby. Service is good although the serving of food always appears slow, irrespective of how full the restaurant is. I will probably choose another venue for local food in future
4
Our guests from California loved the large picture window overlooking St Andrews Cathedral. Now California Asians, they enjoyed the "sashimi salad" we call lohei. The husband born and raised in Hong Kong called it "lo bak ko", the wife from Tokyo called it daikon cake, and the Singaporeans called it "chye tow kway".Chicken Rice and oyster omelette, along with bo bo cha cha, ah balling ("mochi balls in sweet soup") rounded out the first sampling of Singapore cuisine.We all agreed on one thing: local "carrot cake" is most misleading. There are no carrots and it is not a cake
4
I can only comment on the breakfasts. We went to this restaurant everyday for a buffet breakfast since it was complimentary during our stay at the Stamford hotel. They have almost everything you can think of: fruits, bread, cereal, American/Indian/Asian style breakfast items, and an egg station (you can get omelettes/scrambled eggs/fried eggs etc on the spot). It's very convenient (being that it's inside the hotel), but if you're on a hunt for cheap local breakfast, you might want to head elsewhere. Joyce is usually the first hostess to greet you a the front door podium and is a very sweet lady. Amanda (the restaurant manager) is a wonderful/talented lady who is always willing to help
5
This restraunt serves dishes that you would find locally, but with the fats cut out and deliciousness added. Their signature dishesbinclide Laksa and also the best Chilli Crab you will ever have. It's not just the food that is outstanding. The service is also very impressive. The service will always be given with a smile
3
great place & good food with reasonable prices with self-services. This is the place for everybody who need fast food and have budget but those who work or come home late. worth a visit.
3
We went here for good local food in a nice setting and were disappointed. The food was passable, but there is much better to be had in Singapore.
5
Attended for a meal on Friday evening with a group of colleagues.
Absolutely beautiful and can recommend the Nasi Goreng.
Staff at the restaurant will do anything for you and are really friendly.
4
Title says it all, nice restaurant with a good selection of dishes to choose from
Food and Wine was a reasonable price and service was efficient and friendly
4
The restaurant provided an extensive buffet breakfast serving great asian and international breakfast choices. The staff were very attentive and the room is well air conditioned with a friendly atmosphere with views to the Cricket Club.
4
Had rise with a basic vege stir fry
Dish was delicious and serve was excellent
Price was reasonable
It was a business meeting, and appreciated that the restaurant was quiet
3
Location was hidden in a corridor next to another restaurant cafe swiss. Service was okay tho food delivery and bill presentation took some time. We had laksa, a claypot dish and rojak. Tastewise, the laksa was average, a bit too much coconut. The claypot aubergine was quite good tho but a bit oily to my liking. Rojak had good crispy youtiou and not as salty as many hawker versions, which is good. Considering the price which average around $18 for each dish there wasnt much quality incredients in any of yhe dishes. Apart from a few large prawns in the laksa there werent any thing in the other dishes to justify that price. In conclusion, tho it had nice decor n friendly staff, I wouldn't go back again
3
I always bring foreign friends to this restaurant solely for the ambience and to try out local dishes. The ambience is good with great views of the Padang and the CBD area. Service is excellent and food is served nearly always promptly. However, the food is just average. Nevertheless, the selection is good reflection of the local hawker fare
4
This is the 'Kopi Tiam' of Swissotel Stamford Hotel. The format of menu has changed to a simplified fold-out menu but the food remained just as good. Service still just as good. Sambal eggplant dish is different. Now, eight 'tubular'-cut eggplant topped with sambal chilli instead of longitudinal whole slice of eggplant - still very tasty. Crispy fried 'Soon Hock' still very good. House red wine selection still very good
5
Kopi Tiam was having an Indian cuisine promotion 'Pearls of India' and we wanted to check out the food. We had got down to choosing what we wanted and after our orders were taken, we were told that the chef, specially flown in for the promotion; had left for the day....and so, we could not have any of the Indian dishes. What a shame as it was the last day of the promotion. We resigned ourselves to ordering from the regular menu....which was just as good, except that we had wanted to try something new. We went with the tahu telor, chicken curry and sambal kang kong. One can never go wrong with those dishes. For something less spicy, the restaurant offers a non-spicy alternative (usually with garlic in place of chili). To advertise the promotion, apart from table tent cards, the restaurant was minimally decorated. By the entrance, a counter had Indian figurines and turmeric powder, amongst other decorative pieces. The team members also donned Indian-inspired uniforms. Our server Marito stood out for her personalized service and observant eye. She never failed to inquire about how we thought of the food. When we desperately wanted to have the Indian dessert gulab jamun, even though the kitchen was closed for the shift, she offered to speak with the chef and managed to get it for us. Well done, Marito. Overall, an enjoyable experience, with minimal crowd (it was way past lunch-time), quality food and quality service
5
Good food,friendly attentive staff in a small venue. Casual eatery with colourful tables and tableware
3
Kopi Tiam's menu was pretty good in featuring local dishes, and the staff were pleasant and helpful. The food was good, but you can get much better in local food malls and little restaurants nearby. They are doing a better job than most hotel restaurants.
3
casual atmosphere but the food and service were great. surprisingly great choices for a business dinner when not wanting to be seen to spend too much money. great and relaxed environment, great to share and try lots of dishes,
5
This restaurant has a wide range of cuisine available on their buffet which you can enjoy with the right ambience. Service is also good.
4
This was a nice quiet restaurant with very good upmarket local food at five star hotel prices and with very good service by attentive and freindly waiters.

We visited this casual outlet in the Swissotel The Stamford Hotel last Sunday. After eating half of our favourite steam fishhead dish, to our disappointment and surprised, we realized that it was not fully cooked. Some portions of it was uncooked or even not fully defrosted yet. Although they have taken out the dish from our bill and asked us to reorder something else , We felt strongly that the outlet should ensure the food is properly cook to maintain the basic standard of a cook food especially It is manage by a renowned Hotel. A check should be carried out before it serve on to the table. Any food is not well cook should not serve to the guest to prevent any food poisoning. Furthermore the dish is a newly creation menu, it surely amazing to know how it could happen
3
Nothing special, there are better options close by. The ambiance is, well, beige. I did not get the same feeling as what is shown in the photos.The service was inconsistent, one minute they fill your water glass every 5 minutes, then you cannot find anyone to bring your check
4
We frequent Kopi Tiam for local fare. The menu is more than decent, but most importantly, the food is delicious. The fish head curry is always a hit and so are all their other local dishes - fried beef kway teow (noodles), ayam panggang (chicken), chicken rice... What perhaps makes the chicken rice good is the accompanying chilli and dark sauce that go with it. The iced-lemon tea is worth a try as with the barley drink. Quality of food is always consistent
5
For a star hotel like the Swissotel, known for the very best of European and Chinese cuisine, to also host a restaurant with local specialities was a treat our family didnt want to pass up. We were thoroughly satisfied with the range of items (vegetarian also, besides seafood, chicken, pork and beef), portion sizes and taste. Helpful servers give good suggestions and the atmosphere was increased with the number of locals who were clearly enjoying their meals and the informality of the place itself. I would suggest sharing since the items are so different reflecting their Thai, Malaysian, Sichuan and other origins. A credit card promotion added to the value of the meal
5
If you want to try authentic and nice local food with a good ambience and nice serving staff, this is the place to go. They have promotions regularly so besides having great foods, they offer discounts and special dishes. We visit this restaurant at least once a month
