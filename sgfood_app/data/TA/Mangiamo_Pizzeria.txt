After a week in Singapore we really needed this place! A traditional Italian pizzeria, we enjoyed it so much we came back the following evening!
Great service, delicious food, and great atmosphere.
Highly recommended.

Ate in this restaurant three times during stopover from Australia. Can't fault it. Staff very friendly, hard working, efficient and very obliging. Food is fantastic. We also had a discount because we were guests at Albert Court Hotel.

I never forget taste of pizza and friendly atmosphere in Mangiamo restaurant.
everything served fresh, quality and price not comparable to other foods.
Owner/Chef and his wife are very kind, I recommend everyone had a trip to Singapore , have a dinner in Mangiamo restaurant.

Excellent food with a good selection of specials including a bucket of 5 bottles of beer. Everything reasonably priced and cooked to order. Family run restaurant.

Had a really nice meal, good prices, very pleasant service and enjoyable - not rushed. My wife had pizza and I had pasta, we had bruschetta to start which was very well presented on a bread board.
Drinks are a good price too. Very enjoyable.

Good quality food , presented well, Chef and Irena were attentive and good humoured at all times. We visited 3 times in December when spending time in Singapore on our way to New Zealand. It was so good we returned in January on our way back to the UK.

Great Pizza and Ribs, the beers is cold and affordable, the wine is also very cheap for a bottle, the husband and wife team work great together and you can choose your seats if you get there a little earlier say 7.00pm. It's certainly worth a visit, you also get a discount if staying at the Albert Court Village Hotel so it's worth a visit, you will enjoy your dinner
