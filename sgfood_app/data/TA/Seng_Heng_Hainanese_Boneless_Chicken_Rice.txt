This stall always has long queues during lunch hours. Indeed, it was rather delicious, and definitely worthy of its name

The shop opens early and the lunch queue starts at 11. At 11:15am, be prepared for a 30 min wait like what I went through. The chicken, rice and soup was delicious. The price cheap. Very clean for a stall, the only gripe is the wait as people place orders for multiples and this increases the wait time. But definitely a chicken rice that you should go and try for yourself

Another rare gem quietly producing what I'd consider the best chicken rice in Singapore. It's always crowded and the queue though long is well worth the wait! The chicken is super tender, the chili sauce outstanding and the rice.... You have to try it for yourself.

The gauge for judging how good a plate of chicken rice is consists of the following components: the chicken, the rice, the chilli, the soup and the side dishes ('spare parts'). Seng Heng excels in all these categories, hands down. Its sell-out favourite is its boiled (white) chicken meat. It is tender and succulent, with the right amount of texture (softly crunchy yet not chewy). The health conscious will pass on the skin, but the true connoisseur will definite appreciate the slippery, al dente texture of Seng Heng's white chicken skin. Order the right part of the chicken (the thigh or drumstick) and you even get to savour the clear 'chicken jelly' that is only found in properly cooked white chicken. Its roast chicken is just as tender and succulent, which is not easy to achieve given the roasted nature of the meat. Lesser competitors will tend to yield drier and chewy variants. Seng Heng chops the chicken into dainty strips that are substantial enough to bite into, yet lets you savour the full flavour of the meat in a dignified manner. The boss is sensitive to the grain of the meat (think steak grain), and the way the chicken is chopped will always allow you to enjoy the succulence and tenderness of the meat. This is one aspect that is the reserve of seasoned masters only. The dressing (which consists mainly of soy sauce, sesame oil, spices) complements both types of chicken without overpowering the natural taste and flavour of the poultry. The rice is simply addictive. It is flavourful with a nice crunch, without being too sticky or oily. It is the perfect complement to either types of chicken. I have even seen many customers order only the rice after they finished their first serving, just so they can prolong the enjoyment...For people who love to spice up their palate, the chilli that Seng Heng makes by itself is fresh, fragrant, light yet punchy. It is never overpowering; instead, I'd dare to say, the complete Seng Heng experience will never be complete if you skip the chilli. The finely minced ginger and garlic dip is nicely balanced in its fragrance and tanginess too.One often overlooked aspect of the whole chicken rice experience is the complementary bowl of clear chicken stock. Many lesser chicken rice sellers (including branded restaurants) treat it as an afterthought. You don't make money from it, after all... Seng Heng's offer, however, provides ample evidence of how sincere and thoughtful the stall owner is. The soup inherits its rich fragrance from the generous use of chicken bone to derive the savoury, comforting bowl of soup. It is almost free of chicken fat, unlike other joints. If your taste buds starts to be overcome by ecstasy, or the punch of Seng Heng's chilli for that matter, there is nothing better to soothe your tongue with than a nice spoonful or two of its chicken soup. For the connoisseur, chicken rice must come with the side dishes that include chicken gizzard, liver, and braised egg. My personal favourite is Seng Heng's gizzard. This organ is devilishly difficult to cook - it will be hard and rubbery if overcooked or undercooked. Seng Heng has mastered the timing such that its gizzard is a delightfully crunchy snack that tops off a heavenly chicken feast.I could go on, but don't take my words for it. The ever-present lunchtime queue at Seng Heng is mute testimony in itself. The stall starts serving around 11.30am, and by 2pm, most of the chicken is gone. So if you want to sample the best chicken rice in Singapore, do be prepared to wait for up to 45minutes for your piece of chicken paradise. Trust me, it is worth it

We were on a trip and stopped by at this market because we smelled aromas from the market, went up to see people lining up at this very normal food stall which says Hainanese Chicken Rice. We queued for some time and it was definitely worth the queue! The chicken was really smooth and tender, and the price of the meal was really reasonable, or i should say, cheap! You can see how the chef was really focus on doing a great job with his wife helping him. Highly recommendable hawker food!

Hidden gem in the Bukit Timah market hawker centre. You have to queue for at least 15 mins though but it is definitely worth it. Tender chicken, fragrant rice, spicy chilli sauce and not to forget the ginger sauce. Really good comfort food, must try alongside the satay bee hoon and bak chuo noodles in Bukit Timah market hawker centre.

We've been coming to Seng Heng for many years now and have hesitated to write a review as they are our hidden secret comfort food haunt in Bukit Timah. And comfort food it is as their chicken rice is sublime. Everybody in the know will agree that their rice is perfectly cooked, each grain individually coated with that amazing combination of chicken stock and oil. The chicken is consistently succulent and the chicken skin is soft as jelly. Best of all the Chilli sauce beats everyone else's...I'm sure not everyone will agree with me but .... Whatever it is come try and see for yourself! Be prepared to queue as there are many others like me who think they are the "goto" for chicken ric

Been to Seng Heng a few times. The Hainanese chicken rice is a cut above most. More delicate and refined in taste. The only gripe I have is the long wait in the queue. Most recently, we patronised Seng Heng on a Saturday when they had just started business for the day. There were about four persons in front of me in the queue. The wait for my turn was almost 40 minutes. The longest we have waited was just over an hour. Reason? Seng Heng takes calls for advance orders from their regulars as well as regulars who cut queue for takeaways. So instead of giving priority to customers who travel from far to queue for their food, they process all these advance takeaway orders and queue cutters. It makes me mad and no chicken rice, no matter how good, will make me want to return if this practice continues. Its not worth being a fan if you are penalised. Seng Heng should re-look at how they operate and change their system. I am rating it Very Good on account of the taste of food and not the overall experience which would have been Poor
