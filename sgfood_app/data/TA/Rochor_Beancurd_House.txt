Beancurds was nice, but the service from the cashier is super lousy. We didn't speak Mandarin so we did not understand any words from her.

A bowl of cold original beancurd to take away for $1,50. Good, soothing dessert for hot day. Would like it more if the beancurd were sweetened a bit, not just added by sugar water before served. Still prefer Lao Ban (Old Airport) over this.

Our group went to this shop for an afternoon snack. It was much better than my expectation. I am not a big fan for the bean curd menu. I do love their black jello , soy milk, and deep-fried dough stick

I was living in Geylang, one of the areas of Singapore more real and full of personality, for years and this place was often the perfect ending for some night at home with friends or after a walking around the area at night. Tables are under the covered walkway, so you can have your chatting with friends looking the night lights in Geylang and enjoying the street life. My favorite things are Beancurd and soya milk are really good and the youtiao that's crispy and not oily. Customers are from every type, rich and simple people, and all of them seem enjoy the food here

Been coming here for many years and still thinks it's the best. Much better than the one at Short Street in my opinion. Soya Bean drink seems more refined thank most places. Dough fritters are freshly made and have just enough crisp. Egg tarts are not that great. But I still love this place

How they modify the durian.As many people do not like the smell of durian, which makes them not eat this king fruit. Try the durian which has been modified, through wrapping it and then fried it.Delicious one and I am sure that the people who formerly hate it, will become the durian manic afterward

Been a regular customer at its upper thomson branch for several years already. Their peanut tang yuans used to ooze out in the past, and it was super soft and chewy. The peanut would just flow smoothly into your mouth.However, their standard has dropped drastically! Over three ocassions, I ordered tau huey with tang yuan, only to be dissapointed. Their tang yuan was as hard as a rock. I'm not sure if they didn't boil it long enough, causing the inside to be severely stiff! Nothing would ooze out. One bite, and the peanut was terribly dry! I did feedback to them on Facebook and they said they'll look into it. Obviously, nothing has been done. How can they possibly serve this to their customers?Their standard of tau huey has also definitely dropped over the years.Super disappointed

Prior to visiting Singapore, I'd never eaten beancurd. I tried it after a few days and loved the stuff. When I heard about Rochor, which is just up the road from our accommodation, I made the walk up and was not disappointed. I got the cold version with red bean topping. Awesome. A bit like custard. The Portuguese tarts were good too.

I dabao the cold beancurd and also tye cold soya milk. The beancurd is super nice. It has a very soft and smooth texture and also very thick tofu. Best!

Visited the outlet in Balestier Rd. Opted for the warm beancurd. Very smooth and soft texture and really quite tasty. Service was efficient but a little surly. Worth a visit.

A over rated place. They are very good some 5 to 10 years ago. Over the years the standard has drop a lot. Drink become also next to plain water. Beancurd is still ok.
5
If you stay in Geylang-road area then Rochor Beancurd House is place for your breakfast. Quickly and cheapy and yummy. Curry puffs, tofu sticks, soya milks, butterfly buns and other traditional local morning items. You can feel like a local.

I had two bowls of their beancurd pudding on a rainy morning in Geylang. The pudding is silky, simple and comforting. Must try. Will drop by again someday.
5
if you like soay beancurd, this is the place to check out!
They are recently promoting the "pudding style" beancurd too.

stopped by every night on our way back as it was open late. wish it were open all around the clock, everything's great. the soymilk, cold or warm. the silky perfect beautiful beancurd. the little pastry buns. deliiiiiicious.

I frequent the Upp Thomon branch of Rochor Beancurd whenever I'm in Singapore. It offers a variety of freshly made beancurd, with topping, hot or cold beancurd drinks - a healthy and not heavy snack, especially in the late hours. The not so healthy but MUST try new crispy durian roll with generous creamy durian filling oozing from every bite. Very good homely atmosphere with soft spoken and friendly boss, Jason Koh, making time to chat with customers. Highly recommended!!!

This is a review on Rochor's Upper Thomson branch. Becoming terribly difficult in Singapore to find good home-made beancurd, Glad to find Rochor still makes it the old way - soft and silky smooth. Try the deep fried chicken pieces, and deep fried tofu slices too. Yum

Nice place for breakfast if you happen to be around geylang road. They have quite an extensive menu in addition to the famous beancurd and you tiao. Ordered their traditional beancurd, soy milk and of course you tiao for dipping (Yummy). Love how the you tiao suck up the soy milk and burst into your mouth when you took a bite. Is simply Yumms.. Tried their fried beancurd too. It taste good. Not too oily and smell really nice. Do give it a try if you have yet to do so :) However, their egg tart and salted pastry failed to impress me. The skin of the egg tart is too hard, with the egg itself not silk enough. The salted Chinese pastry is not warm, with too little paste in it. But overall, the food is still nice. Will definitely head back again if I have a chance

Must go. Fresh and nice.

What is more mouth-watering than a bowl of smooth bean curd after a heavy meal? Or just for a "tea break"....

I believe this shop is by the eldest and the best of the 3 brothers. Texture and taste of beancurd is excellent, silky and smooth that melts in the mouth.
