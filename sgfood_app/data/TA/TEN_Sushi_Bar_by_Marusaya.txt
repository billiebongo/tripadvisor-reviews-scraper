Salmon sushi is very fresh and buttery, the maki selections are not bad. Street scene ambiance is very, very relaxing with fresh breeze of air from the quay. Cost is not bad and serving quantity is fulfilling.

The place had good vibes so we stopped for a late dinner and drinks. Service was quite good, but it took forever for our food to arrive. The food was good, although the menu was quite limited. Enjoyed the seared salmon belly don; nice mix of flavors accentuated by the drizzle of mayo and sweet sauce. Think it was better that the seared salmon and avocado roll, even though the latter is better for sharing. The sushi selection is quite good with a mix of different kinds of chef's choice sushi. I would go back again when I'm not starving and can wait for my meal to slowly appear

1. Service was impeccable- attentive + sincere 2. Case in point: waiter noticed I had used my wet wipe to clean my hands and promptly gave me another 3. Beautiful presentation- we had a very nicely set plate of two oysters. Some restaurants can't be bothered to plate two oysters but Ten did so beautifully 4. Attention paid to order of food served- salad to oyster to roll to sushi 5. Very good quality and fresh food- we ordered salmon sushi; really juicy oysters; perfectly seared melt in mouth salmon sushi and v fresh deluxe sashimi sushi.
