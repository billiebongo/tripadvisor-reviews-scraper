if you want to impress your partner, take her to Odette, it is upmarket and the decor very smart, staff are very attentive, but you feel it is a bit too structured and automated at times, but other than that worth the effort.

Was not our first time dining here but standards have dropped since then. Many other amazing restaurants nearby which we will go to rather then return to odette

I came here with two colleagues after a long week of work. We all opted for the 6 course tasting menu. I got a vegetarian menu, my colleagues had meat. With all of the extra and optional courses, it felt like about 10 courses total. The food was excellent. The beets prepared several ways was particularly good. My colleagues did the wine pairings and enjoyed them. I had a cocktail that was well-prepared. As befits a restaurant of this caliber, the staff was knowledgeable and courteous. Overall, it was an excellent experience, though I was glad we were dining on someone else’s expense account..

THE BEST RESTAURANT IN SINGAPORE. Excellence, talent and passion make this place much more than a restaurant.We experienced a superior enlightment by feeling that chef Julien Royer had a genuine love of the food, respect of the ingredient, genius of simplicity yet extreme refinement and care of details. His "Heirloom Beetroot Variation" showcases a moving tribute to the vegetable and Mother Nature, as well as his artistic mastery of modern culinary style and techniques.Not to be missed either : the 3-way- pigeon with fresh rosemary from his parents' farm in central France...No description will replace the unique experience we had, boosting the 5 senses altogether. The service is top notch : knowledgeable, discreet yet warm, welcoming and smart staff. The sommelier advice is honest and highly professional, never pushing for more or super expensive wines, but the right ones for you.Although not considered as cheap, it is absolutely reasonable given the top standard. It would be significantly more expensive in Paris or Tokyo.The kind of magical moment that make life worth ... loving

Odette -and Chef Julien Royer- lives up to the awards and accolades that have been bestowed. The whole experience is a journey in taste, texture and emotions.Signatures dishes such as “Le Pigeon Fabien Deneour en 3 Service” and the "smoked organic egg" (with black truffe) are incredible highlights of the menu.Service is also at its best. Great experience on the whole. Thank you Odette

so for those of you that follow me you know we frequent Michelin starred restaurants around the world, it's our hobby. I say this so you'll understand that I have a lot of experience to relate this one too and my expectations for a one or two star restaurant is very high. When we planned out trip to Singapore for personal reasons I was very surprised and happy to find an opening on relatively short notice for Odette. We arrived and were not initially disappointed. The atmosphere and people are nothing short of amazing. They treated us like royalty and the food was amazing. We selected the largest tasting menu and wine pairing and for the most part we were very happy. The food was plated beautifully. The wine pairing was excellent and we could tell a lot of thought went into the selection. We really felt like we were seeing the Chef's vision, that is until we received the Foie Gras. My wife makes a Cream of Asparagus soup that is to Die For! She plates small cubes of raw Foie Gras and pours the hot soup over it so that the raw Foie Gras is slightly cooked. Some of the fat dissolves into the soup and it's wonderful. We've had dishes with Foie Gras around the world, many places in France and we feel we know how it should be prepared. However, for some reason the Chef believes his Foie Gras should be served RAW. It comes raw and a broth is poured over the Foie Gras but the broth was only 40 degrees Celsius. Not nearly enough to cook or dissolve any fat. A dozen Michelin Restaurants and hundreds of French restaurants and we've never met a Chef that would serve raw Foie Gras. The flavor of the broth was wonderful, but the Foie Gras was exactly what you expect from a rich, raw meat such at it. And it wasn't good. We were so perplexed we asked multiple times to confirm this was the way the Chef wanted it served. Oh well, it's very expensive and if you take away that one dish it was so worth it. But the overall experience was not up to par and we don't plan on returning again

This one’s a winner , a journey of exceptional taste and service, we chose the 8 course menu which our server explained what to expect and the bottle of Jeffery red we ordered resonated with each dish that was magically served to us, had a rare chance to a selfie with Chef Julian (he invited us both to his kitchen for the selfie). What a unforgettable night and shout out to Ling and John, and the other service staff who poured our wine and served our many dishes , you guys are one of the best. Truly deserving of the 2 Michelin stars !

The venue is part of the Art Gallery building - a worthy setting for this display of beautifully crafted food served by attentive and interested staff. We were fortunate to be seated at a table with full view of the kitchen allowing us to watch the master (chef) at work. We had the tasting menu with matching wines - not inexpensive but well worth it. The staff were able to deal with a food allergy with no difficulty. The ambiance and decor were beautifully calm amidst the hustle and bustle of Christmas in Singapore. A wonderful Christmas present to ourselves

As expected, food and service were above average. Restaurant ambiance was superb. I have dined in several restaurants in the Top 50 in 2016 and 2017. Most recently in the No. 1 Eleven Marison Park. My feedback is in that level of Michelin Star expectations. I had the Chef’s Tasting menu. The food were amazing taste wise and presentation. However, nothing surprised me. Seeing the Chef in action added to the experience, something I did not witness at Eleven Madison and Blue Hill at Stonebarns in NYC and Ledbury in London. I gave 3 stars more for the reason that I felt I was charged more than I should have. I was offered a cheese course that I thought was part of the Tasting Menu. I was not informed it was an additional option. It is a reflection of attention to customers service. At this level, perfect execution is expected
5
From the moment we walked in the service was amazing! We were directed to a beautiful booth seat and were served by several waiters and waitresses who always came with a smile and were attentive to our behavior - coming over when we were needed, serving food at an appropriate pace and entertaining us with some light banter. The food was amazing as we expected from a place like Odette. The ambience is brilliant, Odette creates a quiet environment away from the bustle of the Gallery where you can enjoy your food and companions.

If anyone would like to see and know how food taste perfect you need to visit chef Julien Royer.Food is cooked perfectly and looks such amazing.The service is also well executed.Deco and atmosphere are TOP.Maybe the best restaurant in Singapore.

Beautiful experience, the decor, the service, the food. Lunch is a very good deal for the quality - I’ll try dinner when I’m feeling flush! Thanks to all at Odette :)

This restaurant lives up to the awards and accolades that have been bestowed upon it. The whole experience was a journey in taste, texture and theatre. We chose the 8 course menu and enjoyed every part. The Chef is clearly a master of his craft and shows passion and dedication to the entertainment of the diner. Neither my wife nor I is a red wine drinker so we declined the wine pairings but with a little help from the Sommelier we chose an Argentinian Chardonnay which we both enjoyed immensely. Without doubt the highlights of the evening were the Chef’s signature “Rosemary Smoked Organic Egg” and the “Le Pigeon Fabien Deneour en 3 Service” which came complete with a written message from the Chef attached to the leg as if it were a carrier pigeon dispatch.The only downside to our evening was to be seated next to a table of two whose apparent sole purpose was to be as difficult as possible. For heaven’s sake, make yourself aware of the principles of a degustation menu; let them know if you have allergies or intolerances when you make your booking; don’t ask the sommelier for a cocktail recommendation and then send it back because you don’t like it and above all, don’t feel that you have to raise your voice so that the whole restaurant can hear. All credit to the wait staff who handled this person with grace and patience

Enjoyed a wonderful lunch at Odette. The ambiance is low key, subtle and extremely tasteful. Service was very discreet though attentive. The food was the true highlight. We ordered the four course meal but with the amuse bouche and other additional courses, it felt like an 8 course meal. My Wife was vegetarian and the vegetarian selections were also exceptional Highly recommended.
5
Second time visiting Odette, first being in April. Food is top notch as usual, with the 6 course being actually about 9 courses including the hors d'oeuvre, palette cleanser and petite fours. Service has gotten even better this time, with the young service team (still a tad raw) but much more well seasoned. Overall highly recommended esp for first timers. For repeat customers (I have been to Jaan, where the chef was from), there's several repeated dishes. Love the food

There are very few true fine dining options in Singapore... many restaurants are very expensive but offer either unimaginative food or mediocre service and some times both! On the contrary, Odette, alongside Robuchon, manages to deliver a superb dining experience thanks to Chef Julien Royer’s smart and carefully crafted dishes and the excellent service.The bonito flower was a clever interpretation of kabu and bonito, the beetroot variations simply perfect and the pigeon from Fabien Deneour could not have received a better treatment.The wine list is very good too. Wait staff was great - friendly, with a good sense of humour and well tuned to the needs of the guests. Things to improve? Not much frankly - a small and irrelevant detail but the manager was wearing a jacket way too tight for his ample frame... a bit odd for a restaurant of this standard. Would also have been great to have a clearer interaction with the sommelier, it was not explicit whom she/he was. Overall, an outstanding restaurant, very much deserving of the plaudits it has received in recent months. Great to see there is room for an even more comprehensive experience as it can only grow to truly exceptional standards.

This is our second New Year's Eve count down at Odette. This year they have the special 8 course La Grand menu $468++. We added a glass of rose, one wine pairing $195++ and coffee/tea with our dessert. The final bill was S$653 per head. The food was fine and service as expected. Unfortunately this year we have to rush through our coffee and tea for the count down in the rain at the rooftop. There was no shelter provision for the heavy rain pitter-patter over our nice cloth, bag, shoes, make-up and hair... both guests and staff all stand in the rain with droplets falling into our glasses of champagne, The experience was awful, the view of firework smoky and blur. The worst counter down experience ever! Odette should provide rain check measure

Had an awesome early birthday lunch with my husband. From the moment we stepped in, the elegant decor and beautifully decorated interiors welcomed us. We asked for the 6 and 4 acts (though one service staff mistakenly told us we had to do the same) so that we could try different dishes. The 4 acts allows you to select and curate your own menu. The 6 set is a fixed course. Both the lunch sets are extremely intricately presented and every dish was impressive. The scallops were fresh, crabmeat was sweet, foie gras melt worthy and basically every dish delighted us. I’ve been to other Michelin starred restaurants and usually end up jaded as the experience didn’t match up to expectations. So when we had an amazing lunch at Odette, we were pleasantly wowed. I’m not sure about the cheese platter since they somehow didn’t offer us. Overall wonderful for a festive lunch.

Odette is tucked away in a very pleasant corner of the National Gallery. Chef sponsor, Julian Royer, formerly from Jaan, runs his fine dining restaurant faultlessly. The lunch menu was excellent and the wine pairing was interesting. The meal reminded me of a scaled down but equally enjoyable meal at Le Cinq in Paris.

Spoiler Alert!This is my story of my journey with Odette...a slice of heaven!My fiance took me to this restaurant for our 1 year anniversary. I’d like to raise a glass to the atmosphere. It was absolutely stunning, elegant, and luxurious! Upon our arrival, we were enchanted by the marvellous National Gallery architecture and interior decor. As we entered, the hosts greeted us with warm welcoming smiles and led us to our cozy table in the corner with a fantastic view of the kitchen tucked behind a glass window. The cleanliness and hospitality was fantastic. The server immediately greeted us with cold fresh towels and asked us if we'd like to start with sparkling water. A few moments later, a cart of 7 champagne bottles wheeled up to our table. We were then brought two menus with a choice of a 6 or 8 course. The six course set menu was the best option for us. The menu is artistically displayed with an awe inspiring collection of dishes that will for sure satisfy everyones’ appetiteThe beauty of every individual dish is designed to make your heart melt, eyes water, and excite your palette. The inspiration of each dish was designed by the talented chefs who were working hard behind the scenes pouring their hearts into creating an award winning menu. Each dish was inspired by 4th generation farmers in Cantal, France. Every remarkable dish was handcrafted individually with excellent coordination and expertise. Every bite is paired with wine for all that Mother Nature has to offer. Most importantly, every dish was served with an excellent description of the natural, most simplest ingredients that are infused to create the most magnificent dishes. My absolute favourite dish was the remarkable, 'Rosemary Smoked Organic Egg' paired with Monopole Clasico C.V.N.E 2014 Wine. The egg is slow cooked for 2 hours. The server poured the egg into a smoked potato syphon with Chorizo Iberico and Meuniere. Odette is the perfect romantic setting for families and couples. The music It's very important to book a table at least 1 month in advance as it’s a very popular place to dine. The only downside about Odette is the washroom location as it is quite far from the main restaurant located in the main National Gallery, so be prepared for a walk. The chefs surprised us with a 1 Year Anniversary speciality cake. They prepared it for us during dessert and paired it with a lovely glass of red wine from France. As we left, they presented us a beautiful cupcake to take home to share as a thank you.This wonderful food journey at Odette blew my mind and I would definitely highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to be enchanted and awed. Thank you for an incredible and memorable experience that we will cherish forever

My group of friends and I which are vivid foodies manage to book a table of 4 couple of months back. The amuse bouche were all carefully crafted showing high level of artistry. Bread service was impressive .Savory dishes were pretty light to my amazement , which is great since the tasting menu were quite long . Pastry side was refreshing as well , superb way to end the meal. Our hostess which is korean were delightful , extraordinary set of knowledge and senses . One that you would expect when dining at white table clothes restaurant . Reminded me alot of the standard of service i had at Quince at San Francisco . 3 stars worthy.

Excellent menu exhibiting creativity, flavours, beautiful plating, and mastering of techniques. The only bémol is certain dishes could have been served slightly warmer. Not overly long, but diverse and very good wine list (mainly French). One of the best service staff in Singapore - friendly, knowledgeable and pro-active. In my opinion, the best French restaurant in Singapore - more daring and ‘passionate’ yet less pretentious than its leading competitors
5
I had an absolutely flawless meal at Odette that I will not soon forget. I made the reservation a month in advance as suggested, and added a note that I hoped I would be seated at a regular table (sometimes when dining alone I have been put at a smaller table or at a bar - even with a reservation at a top restaurant). Well they outdid themselves because not only was I was seated at a comfortable table, but I got one of the two coveted tables that faces the kitchen! It was so exciting to see the chefs and staff working and interacting.From start to finish the meal was amazing. I went for the shorter menu since I hate getting too full, and opted for the wine pairing (highly recommended). I loved the theater of the various presentations, the wine pairings were perfect, the ambience was luxurious, the staff attentive and kind, and overall it was truly inspired and exceeded expectations (which were very high). HIGHLY recommended.

On the last night of our short visit to Singapore, we went to Odette and were really impressed. Odette occupies a small, elegant space in the National Gallery of Art. We had the eight course tasting menu. There was not a weak moment. The beetroot salad presented the beets done three ways, interspersed with floral touches and savory flavor. Chef Julien Royer's signature smoky egg dish presented like a scene from Michael Jackson's Thriller:smoke pouring out of an oblong wooden box. The egg itself, rich and creamy, scented with juniper smoke, perfectly cooked, nestled in a foam and buckwheat risotto bed with crunchy bacon. It was voluptuous. The main course was roast duck three ways-gorgeous duck breast, a leg of duck confit and duck consomme with tiny bits of roasted duck heart- all flavorful and compelling. There was a spectacular and beautifully composed cheese course which we were too full to fully sample, but the two cheese my wife chose were outstanding. The dessert was a deconstructed lemon tart with tiny basil leaves and delicate flowers as visual and taste accents. The first four or five dishes came out really fast, but then one of the wait staff thoughtfully asked us about the pacingand agreed to slow things down a little. Royer himself served us a marvelous yuzu based palate cleanser and gave us a chance to thank him in person for a remarkable meal. This was an exceptional restaurant fully worthy of its recently awarded two Michelin Stars. The service was attentive and friendly, and the staff was full of pride in at the elegant meal they delivered. It was also a third less expensive than Waku Ghin,which we tried two nights earlier. Don't miss Odette. In a year, it will be very difficult to get reservations here

went with my wife for her birthday on 23 November and enjoyed from start to end.warm welcome, nice table, nice waiter.we took both menus ie the "light" one and the extended one and one wine package.The variety of dishes is really good, and we had very nice taste surprises. one highlight is of course the "Rosemary" egg (my own given name for that dish) but the beatroot "declinaison" is really interesting as well (and I am not a veggie guy). Pigeon and its message were perfectly cooked. And dessert was really fantastic (and I am not a dessert guy) but this "lemon" tart was scrumptious.I also really enjoyed the wine selection, not made from classical wine producers, but chosen from not so common areas ! discovered new regions and enjoyed it !Of course it is pricey but was one of the best "grande cuisine" experience I have had.And again very helpful and nice service 
5
me and my mom are food tourists, we travel and try to eat in the best restaurants the country/city has to offer. We are not food snobs and will eat wherever is recommended as long as the restaurant has good reviews. i came here with high expectations and Odette hit a home run!Odette has been recommended twice my fellow foodies so i made sure to book a table in advance before heading to singapore. my mom actually got to meet chef julien in manila during the fusion madrid manila in 2017 thats when he invited her to check out his restaurant in singapore.Long story short loved our meal. it was an experience seeing how synchronized the sequencing of food and plating unfolded. we were there close to three hours but never were we waiting for our food. everything arrived on time and the servers took the time to explain every dish.We were lucky enough to get a front row, practically a chef's table. this made the meal more enjoyable. will certainly come back
5
We were lucky enough to dine at Odettes on our final night in Singapore.We certainly kept the best to last. From start to finish the food and service were fantastic.We live in London and travel extensively so we are rather spoilt with our access to excellent restaurants. Odettes certainly holds her own on the world stage.We both had the 6 course tasting menu, mine vegetarian, my husband the anything goes one.Both were excellent. My standout dish was probably the Avocado au Naturel with freeze dried apple and pumpkin seeds. Light, fresh and totally delicious.My husband adored the Rosemary Smoked Egg and the Venison with Celeriac and Chocolate. The Truffle Brioche was also wonderful.This really was a standout meal!Thank you to all the staff from the kitchen to the front of house.

Odette is a place that challenges your imagination of what food ought to be. Full disclaimer I am not an adventurous eater so therefore I found the meal satisfying but challenging. It is a 8 course gastronomy which takes you to tastes of a wide range. The service is awesome and the crew does care about each guest's preference and request. The wine list is extensive (even champagne by the glass has 5 choices!). The ambience is fittingly perfect to a national gallery and kudos to the gov of thinking so far.Perfect place for celebrating an occasion and if you have not been - it is definitely worth to go
5
From the beginning--the unusual champagnes, the tiny but spectacular appetizers--to the end, a remarkable combination of "this is just delicious" and "it's so complex and interesting." The service is cordial and well-informed--and Vinod (sommelier), Charresse (waitress), and Steven (maitre d') made us feel like friends.Save up, you won't regret this

Reservations only dinning and weekends are fully booked for several weeks ahead. Week day dinning is a lot easier and staff was absolutely helpful as made the reservation via email while overseas A few great options with the set menu which I enjoyed as it takes the guess work out and leave more time to catch up with friends and familyWe went for the 5 course menu which was an absolute delight! The dishes were well thought out with clever use of quality fresh ingredients from pork to a simple egg.My personal favourite was the dessert which was one that keeps giving. So for those with a sweet tooth the happy ending is in fact a sweet happy one Service was attentive without being intrusive. And what was particularly well done was how they accommodated our need to be done in 2hours instead of the usual 2.5hrWould be a restaurant that I would re-visit when next in Singapore
5
Among the very best for service, ambiance, food, creativity, elegance, generous amount of food, the most amazing brown sourdough bread with superb crust.
5
The food was divine, the decor understated and the service efficient, prompt and with a smile.:) they were very accommodating of the 8 yo who never eats and so he ended up trying new things and wanting to go back. A night to remember!
5
Odette was on my list of restaurants to experience on my first visit it to Singapore, and now, One of my TOP favorites of all time. My three plus hour experience exceeded all expectations. Housed in The National Gallery Museum it is the perfect setting for a gourmand experience like no other. The room envelops you intimately with a soft and minimal aesthetic. Accented in whispers of soft hues of blush, grey and white which becomes the perfect stage for the presentation of the multi coursed meal. The service staff members are extremely gracious and orchestrate a seamless experience from the moment you arrive. The cuisine is flawless! Offering a four to eight course selection (eight, which I highly recommend) will take your palate to another level. I suggest to go with the pairing of wine, you will not be disappointed and you will be blown away. I have to say, Odette lives up to its 2 Michelin Stars and see 3 in the near future!
5
Fine dining at its best; a beautiful building, very spacious for a dining room and tables set apart so you never feel crowded - fine dining yet relaxed. Excellent service from the kitchen through to delivery. Although the tasting menu suggests 4 courses, there are so many preliminaries and after meal delights that you feel almost over fed.Beautiful quality produce artistically presented.Although I rarely do the matching wine option, Stephen looked after us superbly and made sure the wine selections matched both the meal and our personal preferences.Excellent value for the quality - a wonderful way to spend a leisurely afternoon
5
Our 8 course degustation dinner was a collaboration between owner chef Julien Royer and chef Ricardo Chaneton of Restaurant Petrus in Hong Kong. Everything was served with great theatre and impeccable taste. It was a real production and well worth the cost.Besides the eight courses, there were four snacks to begin and four douceurs to end. You also could elect to have the wine flight as well. Two of the most memorable courses were the Heirloom carrot with Hokkaido Uni and preserved persimmon, and Grilled Monkfish with Green Sauce and Baby Leeks. It was expensive and not something you would do often but the whole experience made it a special night and well worth it
5
Housed within the iconic National Gallery Museum, this 2 Michelin-starred restaurant lived up to its hype. The decor was elegant and cozy and the food was exceptional. Each dish showed the depth of thought that went into it that resulted in new flavours i never tasted before. A truly tantalising gastronomic adventure that left me extremely satisfied. Energetic plating with smoke coming out of one dish also made it was a very instagrammable experience. But the highlight were the attentive and spirited staff that carried a smile all through the night. Their in-depth knowledge of what they were serving displayed their passion in what they did. It was a truly distinct dining experience and i can only hope it will be for you too
5
First experience at a Michelin starred restaurant and it didn't disappoint. The meals were all extrordinarily well presented, service was fantastic as was the decor. Don't be fooled by the price as you definitely walk away extremely full and content. Other restaurants may charge a high price but often leave you wanting more. Not Odette
5
I love this place alot. The price is on the high side. But I appreciate and feel everything is worth it. I was there for a Valentine's dinner. But it would good, if there is a range of dates where they serve the chef's menu on special days. But still the service and the food is the best I have seen. I will visit Odette agai
5
This restaurant is fantastic. The attention to detail is amazing, the service staff are attentive but not intrusive, and the food is balanced and presented like a performance. I did the four course set menu with the wine flight. It was perfection. It's a bit pricey but that's what you have to pay for two Michelin stars! Can't wait to go again
5
My third lunch at Odette since 2015, but still always as enjoyable and full of surprises. We had the six course menu, which had their amazing signatures like the rosemary smoked egg, beetroot variation, confit trout with kurobuta and lemon tart, which we never tire of despite having tried it before. It also has new reinventions of the scallop dish and poulette with crayfish and truffles, which were full of flavour and surprises. The amuse bouche and petit fours are awesome as always. The new lychee sorbet pop is delightful! The tea and cheeses are of very high quality and service was great. This is a restaurant I would want to return again soon, hopefully for the discovery menu or for dinner some day!

Highly recommend ODETTE and totally deserving of so many high accolades of 2017's 50 Best in Asia No. 9 restaurant, Highest New Entry, 2 Michelin Star, Best Chef Award Ambassador 2017. Service is flawless and impeccable and food is beyond AWESOME ! No detail is left out in the execution of presentation and taste, leaving guests with an epic experience !! Congrats to Chef Julien & very well done to Chun who was looking after us for the evening. 8-course degustation menu for weekend at $268++ per pax. One for one wine i.e. If u purchase one bottle of wine, one bottle of wine that u bring is corkage free. We were surprised to be given a GIFT upon departure of homemade jam, our menu for the night was printed on a nice paper and packed together and with a matching paper bag. Gourmet cuisine delivery, beautifully decorated restaurant, super well trained staff, lots of wine choices, amazing food presentation, a lovely farewell gift ... ODETTE epitomizes an epic memorable indulgent culinary experience that is beyond words !!
5
My friend treated my wife and I to the 8-courses dinner during our visit to Singapore. The restaurant is located inside the National Gallery of Singapore. We were treated to a showcase of modern French cuisine. The food is exquisite and every bite is lovely. The environment is relaxing and casual. My only complaint is that the washroom is located quite a distance away, outside the restaurant. Starting at about 400+ SGD person, I think it's worth it for special occasions!
5
I have been following the work of Julien Royer since he was at Jaan. I noticed that he had a way with vegetables and fresh produce. Odette shows how Royer has risen even further. The cooking is fine and seems to have been prepared with meticulous attention, The sommelier is knowledgeable and a pleasure to converse with, The setting is dignified and soothing and fire is enough space between tables for a private conversation, The ball was dropped by one waitress brought the cheese course but did not bring any bread to go with it.
5
After a lunch here, I realize that the name, Odette, not only identifies and represents the restaurant, it also encapsulates the essence of the food here. Adding that "little something" to create dishes is the philosophy of Odette, Chef Julien Royer's grandmother, and the creations here exhibit just that. In addition, every little ingredient used contributes to defining the taste of the food that is meticulously prepared. In fact, I am very impressed that the staffs here are absolutely precise and detailed in their introductions of the dishes. Even the customized tableware and cutleries, which I appreciate for the varied textures and shapes, tell little stories about this restaurant. Well, I leave it to the amazingly professional staffs there to fill you in on the details if you choose to dine at there. On here, I will instead talk about the highlights.Three pieces of tantalizing-looking canapés are served first to give a sneak preview of what this restaurant is all about. The three vary in taste from the pillow-like savoury, crispy canapé filled with a burst of umami, the cute little tart featuring the earthy flavours of peas, to the cake-like creation that has a mild sweetness, completed with shaved cheese for that extra subtle punch. Things are looking up here.Next up are the breads. Being picky about the quality of the breads, I say the breads here have me raving about them. Served warm, the texture and taste of these fresh breads are perfect: the paper thin stretched dough of the viennoiseries have a bit of crisp and are full of buttery goodness, the sour dough bread is unbelievably soft and fluffy. Paired with the rich butter or the lighter lard—both are peppered with extra seasonings, the multitude of flavours resulted is a joy to savour.The clear wholesome broth of the Mushroom tea is packed with woody aroma and umami of mushrooms, which goes so well with the creamy ceps sabayon and accompanying brioche. I love mushrooms, and I love it when the essence of mushrooms is condensed into this pure form.Appetizer of Hokkaido Scallop looks like it is painstakingly prepared with the thin, translucent slices of Nashi pear decked on top of slices of Kyoho grapes and tiny scallop cubes. The fresh scallop cubes, whose silky flesh has the subtle sweetness of the sea, allow the flavours of the pear slices and grapes to seep in between them, thus each mouthful of this dish is bursting with subtle flavours. Though my opinion is that the scallop cubes taste way better with the grapes due to iota of zest in the refreshing juices of the grapes, which complements the light saltiness of the scallop cubes. Nashi pear has that flowery fragrance and honey sweet taste, which are great when eaten on its own, but does not do much for the scallop. As for the savoury scallop roe tartine, it tastes so sinfully good due to the intense briny flavour.Heirloom Beetroot Variation is a sight to behold. In fact, this dish is so pretty that I am at loss on where to start eating from. Well, I decide to try the beetroot sorbet first since I am curious about its taste. It is earthy yet refreshing—a lovely combination, goes well with the other components of the dish. I also love the cheese mousse that gives an extra salty, nutty taste to the mildly sweet beetroot. Another love is the beetroot meringues perching on top of the dollops of cheese mousse. They are like solidified form of puffy clouds saturated with the goodness of beetroot, and when popped into the mouth, melt instantly into a myriad of subtle flavours that please the palates. A delightful dish all in all.Rosemary Smoked Organic Egg, served with smoked pine leaves, is not only aesthetically impressive due to the presentation of the egg in an egg tray filled with dry ice, the taste can match its looks. The runny egg is of such smooth texture that it does not that sticky consistency that most cooked eggs have, and yet it is cooked to the precise point where the flavours of cooked egg are unlocked. And as I reach over to savour the spoonful of egg and equally smooth potato syphon, the smell of smoked pine leaves emitted from below the bowl invokes the feeling of dining in the woods, except this is in the comforts of a restaurant. I appreciate how this dish engages one's senses and imagination. Bits of savoury Iberico chorizo completes this dish by adding extra bite and intensity to the egg and potato.Not all sea basses are the same, some are better than the others. Not to mention the fish dishes of several European restaurants do not score high in my opinion. So naturally, I do wonder if the sea bass here can meet my expectations. Brittany sea bass proves to be a fish of premium quality, coupled with excellent preparation skills, it is a fish very well-done because of the firm yet pliable flesh that showcases flavours of the sea with nary the fishy smell. The crunchy sakura ebi of strong umami flavour, with the sharp rostrum nicely trimmed off, is a great delight to munch on. Paired together with the fish, it is like enjoying the gems of the sea. I got to mention the amazingly smooth pumpkin puree whose earthy flavour gives a clean finish to the taste of the fish, and it tastes wonderful on its own also. And a shout out to that singular pickled onion petal—it introduces a dash of simulating kick to the dish. Despite my love for the ingredients of this main course, I got to admit that I am not wowed by the Thai inspired sauce. The sauce tastes great due to the chock full of spices, so I figure that most people will like it. In fact, I like Thai food also. However, given that I have Thai food almost every fortnightly, I am not that keen to try Thai inspired dishes in a French restaurant. This is more of a personal preference though.Poulette, meaning the chicken, is firm yet succulent, and the unique woody aroma of truffle shaves and the slight sweetness of polenta cake make this even more delightful to tuck into. The fresh prawns are nice additions to give extra dimension to the taste. But to me, the real star of this main course is that green pepper stuffed with foie gras and mashed chicken. Creamy and meaty, it has so many flavours at work here. I sure do not mind having a second helping of this, notwithstanding the fact that I am pretty stuffed at this point in time.Palate cleanser of cucumber, mint and basil surprises me, in a very good way, by not overloading on the sourness side. The cool cucumber refreshes the palate, the lime gives a tang of zest, the creaminess of the milk sorbet tones down the zesty flavours, and the basil adds a hint of exotic flavour. First time I try a palate cleanser that has so many flavours, with so much thought put into creating it. This is by far the best palate cleanser I ever have.The mellow creamy lemon curd and the crispy yet easy to break sable of the dessert is bliss in culinary form. The beautiful foam on top is simulating in taste. I prefer the bottom part of the dessert over the dome, but both can go together in harmony to result in a multifaceted taste. I do like this dessert though I wish there is more of the lemon curd.Petit fours are lovingly presented in a clay pot that can be separated into four layers. Most noteworthy one is the white chocolate lollipop that goes "poof" the moment I pop it into my mouth, and it becomes a cloud of flavours—think white chocolate and a dash of lime. A nice surprise, I must say.Service here is perfect. Professional, prompt, non-intrusive and friendly, I cannot find any fault in this area. I also like the little extra miles they go, like pushing carts of champagnes and cheeses to patrons for our choosing, pouring the sauces over the dishes when served to our tables, to make this a special dining experience.The interior is posh and soft on the eyes due to the panels of light coral colour. The layout is made in such a way that one will feel to be in a world of his or her own, sort of. Or maybe it is because I am seated at the table with semicircle sofa that gives a feeling of being enclosed, in a good way, of course. There are some tables facing the kitchen that is fully viewable through the automatic glass doors. If you want an action-packed meal, not literally, request for the table facing the kitchen.I cannot say that I will come here often since one needs to make a reservation at least one month beforehand. But it is obvious from my post here that I love this place. In fact, this restaurant is now one of my favourites among favourites. For that special occasion in which my company can definitely make it without last minute cancellation, then yes, this is the restaurant that comes to my mind

Perfection Imagine a fine dinning restaurant at the National Gallery where it's not easy to locate if you are a tourist.We have book in before we arrive in Singapore and Joana was very helpful in every way.As we know the Chef use to be at Jann a few years ago where we visit last year.We had a amazing night of fine creative food and service that make it a night to remember.The dinning room was simple and elegant.Food was most creative with a couple old favourites. We particular love the Foie Gras with Abalone and Eel, Smoked Organic Egg and the Pigeon.We have the most professional wait person to compliment the journey.Felicia the manageress was most passionate to details was most helpful. That make the night flow smoothly and enjoyable.We were escort to the Taxis by her and the Sommelier as my mobility wasn't the best.It was a memorable night of fine dinning at its best

We actually went earlier in 2016 but this is the earliest that I could post. There was a lot of hype around this restaurant so my wife and I really wanted to try it. We called to book for a special occasion and they told us that they were all booked up. Later that day they called us back said they hand a "special" table for us. That table ended up being a temp table they stuck next to a pillar in the middle of the room where my wife and I were both facing that pillar for the entire dinner. Had we known before hand, we would have picked another day. The manager seated us and told us about the menu which was the same for everyone, however when we looked around it was clear that other people had things that were not on the menu. We were then told that they were "regulars" so they made special meals for them - but they were not available to us. Great way to start the meal. Throughout the meal, they could not be bother by us and our "kiddie" table even though they knew we were there for a special occasion. For example, the server would spend timing telling some tables about what was being served but most of the servers that served our table just put down the food and walked away. Once in awhile, one of the managers/servers would walk by and check in but couldn't really be bothered by us.After the meal got started, the food was decent but nothing amazing. Most of it was gimmicky with plating and dry ice, etc. One of the dishes, however, was the straw that broke the camel's back. The oyster spring roll ended up having large pieces of shell in it and it almost chipped my wife's tooth. We showed it to one of the managers and explained to him what happened. He quickly took the plate away and said he would take a look at it. Nothing happened other than the next course being plopped down in front of us. At the end of the meal, after we paid in full, I asked to see the manager about the shell in our food. The manager then proceeded, in an aloof manner, to comment that he didn't feel that the shell was that big and that it didn't appear to do any real damage to my wife's teeth. This really annoyed me because the entire meal was definitely not as expected and for the price, you would expect better service. When I explained to him that I made sure to pay my bill before I raised this with him again, the manager became irritated and rude (even though we paid and did not ask for any freebies) and said that we should have followed up even though he felt it wasn't a big issue. By this point, another manager rushed over to see what was going on since the other manager had started to raise his voice. This new manager then apologized on behalf of the restaurant and the rude manager. I declined their offer to come back for a second try. I hope you all have better experiences than I did if you decide to spend money at this place

Decided to join my partner for an experience at a Michelin restaurant. Staff greeted us as if they knew who we were. We were seated with a view of the production line in the kitchen. I was rather impressed with the productivity of output in a small tight space. Staff appeared to communicate and can clearly see the teamwork. Each dish was well presented and the staff was able to articulate the preparation behind each delivery. Loved the show with the dry ice and well balanced tastes. The only downside was my rush for time having to return to the office. However, the staff was able accommodate our 4-course meal in 75mins. Would have loved to enjoy a nice bottle of wine with this culinary experience. Pricey but worth it.

From the warm yet professional greeting to the last gift of a beautifully packaged red currant jelly from the chef/owner Julian, this is a stunning restaurant situated in the newly opened Singapore Gallery.Every dish was created with presentation, flavors and creative twists in mind. Each plate or serving dish was a work of art, setting off the food to perfection. Our dishes were perfectly matched with wines from around the world. The sommelier took the time to come for a chat before we left and had incredible knowledge of Australian wines when he learnt that was our home.The staff were interested, polite and enthusiastic and knew their food.A definite return visit

The moment you are coming into the restaurant, you will be greeted with the majestic timber door frame. Giving an impression of a timeless, elegance, welcoming diners to a special dining experience.This is the place where you would like to have for special occasions. The right word to it probably 'memorable', with their service, food presentation and dining experience.The ambience during lunch time was bright and airy, natural lightings and interior lightings complement very well, giving the pleasure of dining and those who likes to snap the photogenic dishes for their memories.All 14 tables and one private dining room were occupied during my visit. The packed restaurant was not noisy at all, in fact we were comfortably seated away from other diners. Wait staff were prompt and articulate in briefing us the menu. She asked if we need to rush for lunch or have the time to enjoy 8-course culinary journey as it sure took us more than 3 hours to complete. It gives you an impression of formal dining yet gave a cozy atmosphere with two staff attending to each table.As we have picked our set lunch, we were served pre-appetizers. Three types of carefully prepared snacks were daintily served in plates with different sizes. Just right to tease our taste bud. Next come the Amuse-Bouche Brioche with porcini soup served in sake cups. The mild porcini aroma with frothy cream was just awesome to start awaken your palate. After a short pause, here came the first course of appetizer - Hokkaido uni with scallop tartare engulfed in mussel cloud dome and topped with caviar and few gold leaves. Definitely luxurious. It was served in uni shaped of glass bowl. How interesting! I would say they have carefully chosen the table ware that elevates the appearance of each dish. The distinctive taste of uni was perfectly paired with delicate cloud and the caviar just made everything excellent. This is one of memorable dish.Second appetizer was Majestic Oyster. A simple tender oyster was placed on the bed of charred grenalle potato. The most intriguing part of this dish was the Pickled Tosaka seaweed, among the plants the tiny plant was looking dewy. Served with puree. The heavenly texture of oyster was not mushy at all. High skill needed to present this.Next course was Heirloom Beetroot Variation. It consist of a beautiful spread of salt-baked beetroot with unexpected different surprises in texture and sweet flavor. Even the merengue was made of beetroot juice. This is so special.After quite a long pause, here came the exciting Rosemary Smoked Organic Egg. Aesthetically pleasing when the eggs came with a little grand entrance-dry ice heightens the show! These eggs were cooked in 55 minutes in low temperature, served with iberico chorizo and buckwheat lending its crunch. Extra ordinary dish indeed.Coming next was Foie Gras with Vietnamese garnish (basil and mint) in Dashi soup. Served together with few thin slices of Japanese Abalone and smoked eel. These are so flavorful especially after being torched. This set meal came with Wild Atlantic Turbot in Thai curry style. It is aromatic, a fresh herbs in the curry presented. Every dish is like a surprise unveiled in front of you. Not to mention the interesting plating.The main star of this culinary journey is smoked pigeon. My eyes sparkled when one of the chef actually came to bring the little bird on the bed of herbs in baking pan. When it came on the plate, it was gorgeously presented with appetizing colour of smoked meat. A little corn fricassee, confit leg and Liver Parfait. It came with a little secret note from Chef Julien. As we had our fill of our main, there was a palate cleanser so we could start on our petite four. The palate cleanser itself such a refreshing combination of a scoop of cucumber sorbet with green apple and celery granita, served with a dollop of basil cream. It was a soothing palate cleanser.The whole meal was so enjoyable and they were so sweet to present another gift of homemade raspberry jam to take home. This is one restaurant you need to visit at least once for your special occasion

This restaurant got a two star Michelin stars recently and so, my wife decided on a birthday treat for me in the place. The restaurant is located in the National Gallery which is central in the city. Restaurant is very modern but still feels cosy and has around seating for 20+ pax. Surprisingly there are alot of staff and I was told they have up to 40 staff just to serve the 20 tables. We ordered the six course menu which cost $240++. They had a 1 for 1 wine corkage which is great as I always prefer to drink my own aged wines. The overall pace of the food was very good and the dishes were amazing. Very creative and use of interesting ingredients to add flavour and texture to the dishes. Even though it's supposed to be 6 courses, we counted 11 courses, including all the complimentary small courses and bread serving. Frankly we feel so full after that. Service was lovely with a smile and the manager came over to ask how was the meal and made some small talk, which is good and typical of great fine dining restaurants. Overall it was an expensive meal but very worthwhile in my opinion. They even give you a nice box with home made jam as a thank you gift. Very sweet. Definitely worth going despite the price, especially for a special occasion.

This restaurant gives you a very nice and comfortable feeling.
Service is good.
Prices are reasonable.
Food is good too.

Had lunch there. I was impressed with the food. Good service too. It seems like a cosy restaurant - so they do focus on the service. Nice restaurant to celebrate a special occasion (as it not cheap..)

Amazing degustation menu style dining with personalised service make this a must when craving European food in Singapore.
The wine list full of amazing French wines for all budgets and a good selection of them by the glass deserves a special mention.

We came here with very high expectations having waited for a long time to come here for my bday and it exceeded all our expectations. We tried the surprise eight course tasting menu with wine pairing. It's surprise menu as chef will select a variety of his signature and seasonal dishes, the nice touch was we were given the full menu with paired wines to take home along with a small gift of their homemade jam in a very nice gift box. My favorites were uni, oyster, fish and the pigeon was out of this world. Prior coming to Odette, Jaan was my favorite restaurant in Singapore, now the top spot in my heart is replaced by Odette. Loved the modern and minimalist decor, superb service, and their food philosophy to use simplest ingredients to make remarkable dishes which they have truly excel. Look forward coming back here for another special occasion

Odette is a good restaurant; quality of the food is impeccable; service inside is what you can expect of such a place. They smile a little too much; but honestly it's better than not enough. Now comes the problem. You don't want to drive because you know you're gona drink and you're a law abiding citizen. So ... cab it is. It drops you at the opposite side of the National Gallery because roads are blocked (parade is coming; F1 maybe ...) and you have to walk up and down and through corridors to reach the place; but it's not their fault. Now after the dinner (and the bill ... obviously) you order a cab. You're tired; it's been 3 1/2 hours you're there. There comes the marathon again ... you cross the galleries. 20 minutes later after waiting for a cab that does not come you start to get a little annoyed. So you try to order another cab, but it's midnight; cabs don't wanna pick up guests at 11h50 in Singapore because they change shift; they can wait past midnight to get a surcharge. So 45 minutes later you manage 3 blocks away to finally find an Uber with a tired wife who's shoes are seriously not made for walking (but that's another topic of discussion). When you pretend to that kind of service and price; you make sure your guests get in a cab especially if you know that there might be an issue with the location. At Odette ....once you settle the bill ... it's "goodbye". Well we heard you; next we'll go back elsewhere where we can get a taxi when our dinner is over. Apologies to them for not having yet employed a private chauffeur of course ... quite inadmissible indeed

Having heard and read so much about Odette, and unable to get a table on earlier intended dates, we were thrilled to finally be at Odette for their 8-course lunch. We have had a superb experience at Jaan some years ago when it was still under Chef Julian and came to Odette with excitement and lofty expectations. The decor of the restaurant was pleasing to the eye, well-lit and with a soothing color palete of white and wood. Understated and elegant. I love the concept of the kitchen with glass panels, so that diners have a glimpse of how their food is being prepared. I am amazed that with the kitchen right in the dining hall, and with a sliding glass door for the servers to bring out the food, there was not the slightest greasy food stench at all. The air smelt pleasant and clean. The amuse broche was presented in 3 variations. Now, while the ones we had at Jaan was an impressive medley of tastes that tantalized and teased our taste buds, this pales in comparison. Just your normal amuse broche guys. Beautiful and delicate, but oh-so-1-dimensional. The bread was very good though, especially the truffle croissants, the best I've ever had in my life. Just the right temperature slightly warm, very soft and yet delicately flaky. It tasted subtly of black truffle but not overly pungent nor overwhelming. The sour dough was ok, and the olive bread was good too. Then came the plethora of courses. While the courses seriously wowed us at the previous restaurant, the food was comparatively less impressive here. Maybe it was because we have had the rosemary eggs and mushroom soup before, and they don't surprise us anymore. But both dishes were undoubtedly still very good. Can't remember much of the other dishes. Off hand, we didn't really fancy the pigeon. We saw lamb as part of the 5-course and were disappointed we got pigeon instead. The fried eggplant was ok, we also had scallops and foie grass which were not too bad. Reasonably delicious but nothing inforgettable. One thing I remembered was an overuse of citrus flavors and caramel sauce, featured in several dishes. I think sorbet was featured like twice or thrice. And the dessert was lemon as well. The meringue was too cloyingly sweet too, which I don't really fancy. Many of the ingredients and seasonings were repeated. Then came the coffee and petit fours. because the petit fours were unbelievably amazing at the previous restaurant, it is definitely lack luster here. The white chocolate earl grey popsicle was ok, there was a round lemony (again) ball (too sweet and sour), a "traditional cake" thingy (which we didn't like at all) and 2 caramel candies (too soft and sticky).Service was prompt and polite. We also felt like we were rushed through the meals. The plates were cleared as soon as we finished the last morsel of food, and the next dish was served promptly. Also, the table was not cleaned often enough and it is really my pet peeve to eat while being surrounded by food crumbs. I remembered fondly I was served an ENTIRE chocolate fudge cake on my birthday at Jaan and it was absolutely delicious. We could not finish it and they even packed it up for us to bring it home. This time we had the dessert (part of the menu) with the wordings "happy birthday" in chocolate icing on the plate. The neighbouring table had ONE slice of cake (the family/ friends of one of the chefs) but we didn't. How's that for customer service? But that was ok, we understood and weren't too upset. We were also charged $20 for 2 coffee after paying more than $500 for the food. Oh well.I was presented a jar of homemade jam at the door. I appreciate the thought, but I think I would have preferred a slice of cake and coffee really. Because well, I don't even eat jam

Honestly, I went to this restaurant with lowered expectations after having been to Michelin rated and Top 5o restaurants and leaving disappointed. Odette completely surprised me! From the canapes to the dessert, everything was not only beautifully presented but also tasted extraordinary. it was attention to detail all the way. Decor was subtle but upscale. If you do not have a large appetite, the 4 course if more than sufficient as it is actually a 8 course with all the extras before and after. Price-wise, I did not think it was over-priced. I felt I got decent value. One of Singapore's best restaurants in my opinion
5
Tried the 8 course lunch menu with wine pairing. General Manager Steven Mason share the story behind all the wines to pair with the dishes. FOH team and the chef will take turn to table to explain the food they are serving and finest ingredient. Must try. 100/100

The person(s) who ranked this restaurant no. 9 must be either been bribe or blind. I have NEVER experienced this type of service in any fine dining restaurants in Asia Pacific. I booked this place in advance for Friday 16/6. This waitress made contemptuous facial expression which my friends saw whilst I was enquired about the menu. I asked following 1. If the scallops can be cooked2. Can I change slow cooked egg to something else Her reply to 1. That will distract the chefs2. Would you like to change to another menuI was not impressed with her reply to latter, further offend by her making contemptuous facial expressions.How dare she do that, she is NOT fit to be in service industry.How can Odette employ such waitress. Odette may put up a spectacular presentation, but is NOT worthy of being ranked no. 9 overall.My friends & I will NOT spend our money here again. We will NOT recommend anyone to visit Odett

Visited on Saturday for my bday. Food was very good, especially the white asparagus and also the melon and celery palate cleanser. The cherry and almond desert was also very very good. The mushroom tea was very tasty and also one of the highlights. I had the vegetarian menu, which for a red blooded meat eater was brave. However at no point did I feel like I was missing out from the other menu. The service was also personal and friendly, with some great wine recommendations and endless supplies of tasty fresh bread.A very good meal, however don't expect much change from $1000 for a couple. Not quite as much wow factor with some of the dishes as another fine dining experience I recently had. Hence the four stars
5
What a surprising menu. Had a thoroughly enjoyable night with a great set menu and beautiful setting. Not a cheap dinner but well worth the experience.
5
Chef Julien has never disappoint us each time we were there for lunches and dinners. In fact, he amazed us each time we ordered different dishes, his excellent choices of ingredient has made him a master of taste and presentation.
5
Booked into Odette as a solo diner and was treated like a welcome friend! The entire staff were attentive and solicitous, and I met all of them, including Chef Royer who, along with his staff, provided one of the most interesting, inventive, beautiful and tasty dinners I have had in a long time. General Manager Andrew Mason spent much time chatting, and making me feel welcome and at home. This is a superb restaurant. Although there is no a la carte menu, the dishes on the tasting menu were all to my liking (you have a choice of 6 or 8 courses at dinner with optional wine pairings) and the wine pairings were outstanding and included some very unusual selections. Although the meal was not inexpensive, the experience in this beautiful space, of a dinner prepared by an outstanding chef, and served by a wonderful staff was well worth it! A must visit stop in Singapore for lovers of fine dining

I had such a delightful time at Odette! We stepped in the beautiful dining room with its soft, warm and elegant decor, welcomed by a young lady with an inviting smile and sat on very comfortable banquette seats facing the kitchen. First time I actually enjoyed an open kitchen restaurant as you can have a peek to what's happening behind the glass doors but it's not disturbing to the point that's all you see and because it's closed you only smell what's in your plate. The staff is elegant and discreet and didn't mind repeating when I couldn't catch one of the ingredients she just described. The sommelier is young but very knowledgeable and they have a Champagne trolley so we could choose a Champagne by the glass from a selection as an introduction before moving on to wine later. The food is absolutely divine! Everything is so tasteful and very well balanced, I personally liked how the chef mixes textures in each plate in a subtle way and how there's "layers" of taste in each bite that compliment each other without being confusing. I tried not to eat too much bread but it was hard because they're all delicious but my efforts paid off because I still had space to enjoy some cheeses at the end of the meal. I saw the trolley going to the table next to us and knew I had to tried a few before dessert! I would definitely recommend Odette to anyone who would like to have a true fine dining experience, a romantic dinner, celebrate a special occasion or impress a big client. Yes, the bill isn't cheap but for that level of quality of food and service it's totally worth it. No regrets

~I was told by Sarah, this was the place to go and the food was to die for. She'd just finished a tasting menu that was absolutely divine and said I've love Odette~I had dinner here 2016Aug a year ago~the SMS confirmation was a nice touch as is the calling ahead reminder~parking is gonna be a challenge to get in and out... the entrance to the carpark is along St. Andrew's Road past Old Supreme Court & City Hall, IMMEDIATELY just after Coleman Street, on the left there's a slope down going underground to the carpark~the building is HUGE and adjoined to each other, ODETTE is in the Old Supreme Court wing~hostess is polite and prompt in seating at the reserved time~waitstaff however are kinda haughty and rigid... the high handedness of these service staff who look down on any patrons who brings teens for dinner is very strange considering the menu is priced the same as for adults~bottomline I did not like the service at all, on 3 occasions with 3 different people 1. did not bother to explain what was in the dish served beyond repeating the name of the dish (guys it's French fusion food, the name doesn't tell you much of anything beyond a vision unless a key ingredient is mentioned)2. made both my 11 & 15 year old feel unwelcomed (OMG they already had to change into dress shoes and pants to meet the strict dress codes, why are they alienated when attempting to ask questions about the menu) are you certain that your own staff speak fluent French enough to translate in English what the concepts were or were they just repeating all that they knew and could not help but ignore questions from younger people who will grow up hating these places... my younger one did not touch or finish almost all this courses3. now rude service staff is intolerable and I really should have walked out immediately. our primary waitress serving the table is the most dismissive person I've encountered in any restaurant with or without any awards... OMG OMG OMG she did it once to my wife, twice to my kids and once to me... HOW was it Done? when replying to questions in a tone that suggests our ignorance and table manners, etiquette must be followed, and that we should not come bringing children eg menus taken from the teens, speaking over a person assumed unable to make their own decisions about food or drink, behaving like we should know our food choices etc~there was a more senior dressed staff which acceded to our request to vary the menu AND the sommelier is absolutely spot on in pairing and my appetite...food was hits & misses children of any age not recommended, prolly an adult only restaurantUnfortunately I go for good food but will never return for bad service EVER

I don’t really know what it is actually takes to be a Two Michelin Star restaurant, but Odette certainly lived up to providing a very thoroughly enjoyable and holistic dining experience.I recently watched a tv cooking programme where budding Masterchefs cooked a meal under a Two Michelin Star restaurant chef. Food-wise, I can now comprehend what it takes. It must be a multi-course (who says the Chinese 10-course meal is extravagant?) evening of entertainment; not just a meal.Odette serves a Prix Fixe Degustation menu of eight courses, not including the amuse bouche, the wonderful breads with special spreads, and interesting petit fours. There is a vegetarian option which we all felt we ought to try when we return next. Be prepared to sit through more than a few hours as it is meant to be a dining experience.The dining experience is like its location: art in the National Gallery. The ingredients are diligently sourced from the world’s finest and the dishes invented creatively. Then the food is delicately prepared and laid out intricately, again like artwork. They are usually a sophisticated fusion of flavours. Typically, the sauce will be poured as they serve you. Quite often it involves smoke to add the smoky flavour or the dry ice for cooling and drama. Dinner started with the amuse bouche which involved some “chemical reaction” into a yummy froth. Beetroot usually tastes slightly earthy but Odette served several very tasty variations of the deep purple root lined up into a very pretty flower patch.Our pièce de résistance of our fabulous evening at Odette was the Rosemary Smoked Organic Egg. Besides the smoke, the perfectly sou vide egg was served in three-quarter shell in the traditional cardboard egg holder then poured into a bowl. It even came with information on how many degrees it was cooked and instructions on mixing the runny egg a little with the chorizo iberico before eating. It was heavenly.We were slightly distracted from the fish in the Wild Turbot Esprit Thai by the yummy little Sakura ebi garnish. The finale pigeon dish was previewed whole in a bed of herbs to us before they plated it in three ways. The breast was surprising larger than we expected of a pigeon and smooth and silky in taste whilst the confit leg was skinny but crispy; and came with a message from the chef. The liver parfait complete with the heart was rather ... usual.The cutest prize must be between the Lemon Tart in the form of a creature from Pokémon or the clever petit fours served in a four-layered tray spearheaded (pun intended) by a macha lollipop chocolate.Food aside, the service at Odette was not only attentive but down-to-earth and friendly; none of the snooty stuff in a classy restaurant. When we were ordering wine, we said to super friendly GM Steven that we didn’t want to break the bank. He recommended a slightly more robust Pinot Noir from Kooyong; which started a chat around this lesser known wine country on the way from Melbourne to the “what’s the island where you see penguins”. We nicknamed him Philip Island since. He personally guaranteed the wine, else he will come back and drink it himself. Philip, I mean Steven did come back, disappointed.We were served by various staff throughout the dinner who were all articulate about the food and restaurant, and cordial. They all could rattle off details of each dish along with suggestions on how to best savour them. One of them heard us joking about the cutlery not being Safico from Sia Huat, Singapore’s beloved store for f&b businesses and home cooks. Instead of boasting about their Perceval cutlery including the 9.47 from Thiers France, we reminisced about being “kids in a candy store” at Sia Huat. And yes, the handcrafted cutlery, crockery, handblown glasses and tumblers added to Odette being a finely curated restaurant.At the next table, a lady was dining by herself and taking notes. We speculated if she’s a food critic and whether she ordered half a bottle of wine like in the film, Burnt. The same server heard us and recalled with us, Bradley Cooper in this film teaching his restaurant staff to identify the Michelin inspector. Witty!Finally, to top the Odette experience, the décor and graphics have a consistent very pleasing hue of beige. The commissioned artwork of petal-like motifs features in the centrepiece mobile – sorry, aerial installation, paintings and even the stationery and packaging.Surely there must a criticism for Odette? If you force me, I would like the serving staff to have a more elegant and distinctive look to complement their outstanding food and personalities. The shirts with mandarin collars could be less ordinary, smarter and a tad better fitting coming from a bespoke tailor. The managers looked dapper in their grey double-breasted suits and chefs - who can be seen through the large glass doors to the open kitchen, very cute in their newsboy caps and standard whites.If I had a wish to enhance the experience, I wondered if I can watch how the chefs cook and plate my food – via technology; to further appreciate the artisans at work. The eight acts meal was S$268 each; not everybody’s ordinary night out. But I would still rate Odette outstanding for its holistic dining experience, worth the month’s reservation and even if I can’t use my corporate expense account. Well done Odette, and congratulations for retaining Michelin’s Two Star.PS. We didn’t meet Co-owner Chef Julien as he was away but his Sous Chefs and kitchen delivered nonetheless

Celebrated my girlfriend's birthday there and we opted for the lunch set. Beautiful place n embience. While the service staff were professional but there was no warmth or interaction just merely telling u what was in the food. Unlike Foo'd by oldani at Victoria Theatre the staff there were so friendly n interact with guests like old friends yet professional. Well the chef took great effort in preparing my dairy free courses yet did not compromise the taste I really liked it. Everything was beautifully presented. I will go back again.
3
I came here only once for lunch but once was enough.My biggest beef is that the food was meh. A lot of foam used as part of presentation, which I personally feel is so passe. And even more upsetting was that the taste of the food was very muted. Nothing really stood out.The space is beautiful and the uniforms of service staff was so soothing to look at.Service is earnest but at that time, still rather wet behind the ears.In summary, I found the food pedestrian, albeit served in a nice atmosphere. I really fail to understand the hype behind this place

An amazing experience ! I would like to share my experience at Odette Restaurant. Firstly, the location : the restaurant is based in the National Gallery of Singapore, splendid; Wonderful. Secondly, the restaurant : The restaurant is very modern and classic, a real fine dining. The team is very helpful in every circumstances, professional team. Then the food : Thank you for all the team, the Chef, Chef Julien Royer, and all the kitchen for what you provided during this dinner for us. We decided to take the wine pairing, it was perfect, the choice of the wine with the dish, very unusual but perfect, thanks to the sommelier Vincent. From the canapé to the petits fours, everything was excellent, products, cooking, dressing and the atmosphere. Thank you very much for all, it was sublime

Went to Odette with 2 friends for dinner and ordered a 8 Course tasting menu. Food was good, but not extraordinary delicious. Only gave me an impression of 'Just another high end fine dining experience'. Friends commented the ambience gave a cold feeling and the aircon was really cold. Staff service was good. Btw, we took 3 and half hrs to finished our dnr (in between each course took too long). There is still room for improvement

Food is nice to look at, nice to eat but wine pairing was nice to smell , not so nice to drink. It is another expensive western restaurant that are becoming too common. It has no wow effect for me.
5
I went there with a Friend for lunch. The food was seriously so fresh and tasty. Service was very well trained and can explain all the question about the food. Well done!

very good restaurant, very nice service, very good quality of raw material and plate presentation, excellent choices of wines, perfect elegant atmosphere ... 2** stars with laudewhat a pity they do not have the toilette inside the restaurant and you need to go to the public one located in the buildingand also some more italian wine from north which could better pair the seafood plate

Chef Julien is a master of beauty, taste combinations, and colors. He uses very fresh and prime produces and enhances them beautifully. He is a very generous and humble chef who loves to share his passion for fresh and healthy products.He has been my preferred chef in Singapore since his time at Jaan.The whole team makes you feel really welcome

If the wallet allows for us, try to be patient and secure a booking weeks ahead. The wait is worth it....every dish is a piece of art: so beautiful on the plate and such a beautiful experience for your senses. They only have 2 menu options (each with 8 small dishes: vegetarian and non-vegetarian) but they are both selected for the season . The attention to detail is just unbelievable, staff are attentive and knowledgeable and the wine and cheese menus are also impressive. The bill is impressive too. But for special occasions, you will remember the food and the ambience and your special someone that you are sharing the meal with:-)

My son works at this restaurant Finally had the pleasure of dining at Odette 1½ years after it opened! We’re not the type that frequents fine-dining restaurants but it was one of my family members’ birthday and we really had an incredible afternoon thanks to the superbly friendly service staff and the chefs that prepared the food and cake ^^ Thank you all! ❤

I have been lucky enough to dine around the world and this was the best. The 6 course degustation was sublime, even though the wine list is crazy expensive.Do not expect to come here for a cheap meal!!For two $700 but worth every penny. Attentive staff, serious but good atmosphere and for a 'special meal' perfec

Not because it has the Stars but it was very good.They also have 6-course and 8-course menu for lunch but that seems to be a bit much on a working day

Went to lunch recently with family for a birthday celebration. Booked the table one month in advance as heard the place is very popular. Everything was amazing, from the beautifully presented and perfectly tasting dishes served on custom made china, to the friendly and funny staff. Not to mention the great decor and ambiance. Best part is when Chef Julien personally serve the desert which we did not expect. Having been to many Michelin starred restaurants, this is one of our favourite. The place is expensive plus we are not big eaters which is why went for lunch since lunch has choices of 4,6 and 8 course meals. Will definitely be back for more

Odette is one of the few restaurants in Singapore that offer the sense of romance, elegance, and fine food and wine,, Other restaurants in similar pedigree in Singapore I find are Les Amis and Restaurant Andre. It is one place where one would like to dress up for the occasion and have a memorable time.The ambiance was spot on, the decoration was modern, minimalistic, and tasteful, it worked well with the high ceilings and space. The service was courteous, professional, and knowledgeable. They knew when to give you space and when to engage in a conversation; it was appropriate. Our visit to the restaurant to celebrate our wedding anniversary coincided with Chef Julien's special celebration of his journey in Singapore. It was a special event and the menu was a tribute to the places that moved him, the people who shaped him, and the produces that inspired him everyday. It included his signature dishes throughout the years:1. Japan - with Hokkaido uni;2. Bora Bora - Swordfish;3. London - Mushroom tea;4. Chef Michael Bras - Warm vegetable composition;5. Singapore - the 55' Smoked organic egg;6. Thailand - Kinki on the scale;7. Home - Fabien Deneour pigeon en 3 services; and8. Agnes (his wife) - Tout ChocolatIt was personal and we were very happy to be part of the evening. In addition the restaurant prepared a special desserts for our anniversary.We chose the table facing the kitchen via a sliding door window. This kind of reminded us of restaurant Geranium in Copenhagen, where guests had a closer connection with how their foods were prepared. This was a personal choice. Like other guests we were given an Odette apron each after the dinner; this was a nice gesture and pleasant surprise.This restaurant is one that will leave an impression.

The food and service were great. I would certainly go back again...You can either choose wine pairing with an extra cost or just order the wine by glass.
5
Odette's interior is simple yet modern and very quaint. For a fine dining restaurant, the service was above average. Food was perfectly delicious in every way.
5
Menu,food,ambiance,staff-all excellent.A typical French restaurant in the heart of Singapore.I love every single dish,it is definitely worth every penny.
5
We had the 8 course tasting menu with our own selection of wines and one of the best cheese platters I have had in my life. The tables are well spaced apart and the service is attentive while not being pretentious. I couldn't believe we were the only patrons to partake of the cheese platter. It was amazing! Try it. Just once. Overall, the meal was expensive. Very expensive. But worth every penny. Save up and go for a special occasion. We will return
5
This restaurant is a real treat, we went last night and its simply the best meal we have enjoyed for a long time. The restaurant is in the national gallery, it is cool, calm and sophisticated. The staff are attentive and knowledgeable about their menu/wine. there is 2 choices an 8 or 6 course tasting menu, we went for the 6 courses as the main dish was lamb versus pigeon on the 8 course. We also opted for wine pairing which turned out to be a very good choice. There really is not much more to say, the food was attractive, delicious and very enjoyable, you will love this place. There are not many covers, I think 12 tables, and its popular so you need to book and you need to book quite a way in advance, but its really worth it, go and enjoy
2
I enjoy food a great deal. Sure, one man's meat is another's poison,so this is purely my opinion. The bread was certainly the best with a trio of sourdough and truffle brioche and I think a rye bread which was soft inside and toasty outside. The 6 choices menu was pretentious with lots of foaming, sorbets. The chicken breast for main was tasteless with flavor from the sides. I believe it's a two starred restaurant.Michelin is starting to be an unreliable guide. For 150 SGD plus tax, LOL. I really miss Moliere in Sapporo

from the moment we were greeted with a warm smile by the hostess and the by the comfy pastel colour of the restaurant interior we knew we will be enjoying our meal at Odette.we opted the 8 course for our lunchfirst came the canapés nice cute bite size snacks with a boom of flavour to start off our meal.then came chef julien signature mushroom tea serve on a board craved out like the shape of a mushroom with a tea bag and some dried cep mushrooms.in goes the tea from a French press to a cup filled with sabayon and some nuts. tasty!bread was serve with in house butter and lard on a tree bark!its like a onion filled with layers after layers of goodness.first course we had Hokkaido uni and carviar.... that cream foam hidding a bed of uni and the saltiness of the carviar cutting through.. mmmmm i would like to have more.lagostine with bergamot .. my fav dish! the langostine is so sweet and tender accompanied by a hint of bergamont.we also had chef julien"s signature rosemary smoke egg... this dish interestingly remind me of breakfast...the fish course was really nice.. kabocha pumpkin with sakura prawns and thai volute which i heard is chefs secret blend of spice.we had lamb... not my fav meat by hell it came out the most unexpected was and i swap my plates clean! desserts are just as interesting as all the dishes! a pokeball i called it... lemon tart with basil sorbet... you will understand during your visit and pls try the lemon tart.of course not forgetting the front of house that severed a explained all the dishes and the sommelier pushing a "timsum" ops champagne trolley that gave us alot of information abt the wine we are drinkingto the kitchen team of odette and chef julien slogging and putting wonders on diners table thank you all.

Went this evening. Impressions1. Food was below expectation . Must say I certainly was expecting a stellar meal. A lot of emphasis on presentation but taste and combination of textures was underwhelming . In particular , the beetroot dish was too complex- too many temperatures, too many textures ( sorbet, crunchy, jelly etc)2. Scallop and asparagus dish average . Combination of Flavours didn't bring out the best in the dish3. Rosemary egg dish had a good combi of Flavours. Not too complex 4. Fish in that Thai velouté - i didn't appreciate the sudden injection of a very distinct Asian flavour. Again I felt this resulted in an lack of balance in the overall meal 5. Pigeon was good6. Dessert - a lemon curd on sable biscuit with some basil foam on top - was disappointing. Again the lack of balance presented itself - foamy meringue like top overlying a soft lemon curd with a very thin biscuit base resulted in an impression of a very mushy type dessert 7. Staff were good and generally professional
5
We booked weeks in advance for a table on a Saturday but it was well worth the wait. We had the 8-course meal which was excellent. However, I must admit that the egg dish was rather too reminiscent of Jann. All in all the 3-hour long meal was thoroughly enjoyable. All the dishes were excellent except for the liver moose that came with the pigeon main. It was too gamey for me. Even the dessert which I thought was rather too whimsical for posh fine dining proved to be delightful. The ambience was lovely - simple to and understated. Tables were decently far apart. Service staff were attentive, friendly and didn't make us feel obliged to get bottled water as is the case with many fine dining places. Coffee to end the meal was a smooth brew.Will I visit again? Yes but hopefully after a new menu is introduced.

Odette was recommended to me by a couple of blogger friends before they got in the top 10 of Asia's 50 best restaurants 2017. I've always wanted to try more french style of cooking since Manila only had Champetre. To say Odette did not disappoint is a huge understatement. Odette is quite simply and could possibly the best meal of my life as of now. The food was outstanding the service was fantastic. I chose to go for the Spirits selection and was happy with it. They have Adrien Camut Calvados which is liquid from the gods. They really know how to make a customer happy and make it memorable. I loved every dish and every moment.

This restaurant serves innovative cuisine like many others new wave restaurants.
Although the food are nice, it is getting a little less interesting.
Any way, this place has beautiful ambience and good service.
Recommended.
5
Unforgettable! Nice ambience and really really good food. Service is superb too. After eating there for the first time I have come back at least another 2-3 times. The food is just fantastic! Be sure to make your reservation at least one month in advance!
5
Every dish is so well executed and delicious. Food presentations are colorful and beautiful.
Staffs are professional and friendly; made you feel very at home.

Had the 8 course tasting menu day after Valentine's day. I will never forget it! The restaurant is well appointed and somewhat whimsical. The menu, the preparation and the service top notch. 3 hours went by in a flash and we left feeling we had been treated to such a unique experience. The National Gallery is stunning
5
The restaurant was very cosy and quiet- perfect for a romantic meal with your other half. We had the 8 course tasting menu. The pigeon was cooked to perfection and what we really love was the eggs and how it was brought to us. Really enjoyed our anniversary meal here
5
We had the 8 course tasting menu. It was wonderful and filling. The room is beautiful and the National Gallery is an unusual backdrop. Especially liked the foie gras and cod courses. Wait staff was perfect and we liked it enough to stay long enough to close the place

We had an amazing time (3 hours !) at Odette. We went there for dinner, and were lucky enough to get a table on the same day (someone had cancelled last minute!). Just make sure you book ahead of time as it is really busy.In terms of food, it was excellent from beginning to end, Chef Julien definitely earned his 2 stars. The only thing I thought could have been different is the Chicken which is part of the 6 dishes course..the chicken was good, but I would have expected something a bit more exciting for an establishment of this standard.It is a bit pricey indeed (1,000 USD for 2 people!) but we enjoyed every bit of the experience. I would recommend going there on a weekend so that you could enjoy. We went there after work, and it was a very long dinner, so towards the end we were a bit tired.My favorite dish is the beets. The colours, the flavors, the arrangement..everything about it was so different, every bite was exquisite ! The famous egg dish was excellent as well, and impressive to watch when they serve it from the kitchen.Merci Chef Julien pour ce voyage culinaire

I don't really consider myself a "foodie" but I sure love to eat, up and down the spectrum. My wife and I both really enjoyed the meal and the experience. The presentations were impressive but I never felt flavor was left at a disadvantage. We went for the 6-course (your other choice is 8-course) and I wish I hadn't eaten so much bread! But I couldn't help myself, and I thought I could afford it since we went with "only" 6 courses. I was totally stuffed when we left. Sure there are 6 courses but they are I would say larger than average compared to most epicurean establishments and there are multiple amuse bouche, the aforementioned bread with 3 choices of spreads all of which were fabulous. This included house-made lard with sprinkles of crispy bacon, OMG so delicious as you feel guilty slathering it over that bread. I also highly recommend the wine selection, all were very good and 2 of the three really really impressed me, a varietal from Sicily I've never had before and a white with a taste I've never experienced. Well done somelier! Service was also first-rate, professional, friendly, and interesting as well. I'm very pleased I finally visited this restaurant

Odette exceeded my expectation of "haute-gastronomy': excellence at every step of the way resulting in an unforgettable experience.Firstly you have a fabulous squad trained like high-level athletes both behind the stoves and in the room. Special mention to the service team that is extremely professional yet relaxed making you feel instantly comfortable. Secondly a brilliant young Chef - Julien Royer who leads his team like a conductor his orchestra respected for talent and experience rather than authority or fear. Finally there's what's in the plate: an extraordinary outburst of flavors, fragrances, colors and textures that overwhelm your senses and leave you with an impression of what perfection must look like!Run to meet Odette if you're lucky enough to get a table ;
5
I invited my wife for her birthday. We had the 8 course meal with wine flight. It was gorgeous, everything was perfect. The service, the presentation of the dishes was amazing. We could take our time to really enjoy our lunch. It was a great birthday celebration
4
You should be full after the 8 course. Nice ambience and good place to relax but pricey on the extreme high side.
5
2 star michelin restaurant ... indeed a tall order to live to as high expectations on the food is unavoidable. Love the egg dish experience.
5
WOW! What a terrific dining experience this is. Truly and deservedly one of Singapore's best restaurants, if not the best. Julien Royer has made significant strides ahead since his departure from Jaan, where he already delivered stellar dishes, some of which he evidently has his signature on and now presents in even more refined versions here at Odette. Food flavor combinations are clean and intense, textures refined, plating extraordinary. Everything at Odette just works, the calm soothing colors and spacious layout of the dining room, the very comfortable chairs and banquette seating, the expansive glass wall allowing visibility of the well-organised kitchen activities, the waitstaff, the service, the quality... Chapeau, Julien Royer and Odette team

Have been wanting to try for a while, but not easy to get reservations, but i moved out of singapore a year ago. Got a reservation when i was back in town during chinese new yearA minimalist and clean setting. Sadly my view of the open kitchen was blocked by a giant pillarOpted for the 8 course which had the uni starter. The 6 course shares the beetroot and egg courses with the 8. The egg and pigeon courses were dishes the chef did at Jaan, and Jaan still kept the dishes as of 2 years backThe egg dish was probably my favourite , but i can eat this at a few places all over the world nowThe jam gift at the end was a nice touc

We do not consider ourselves experts but we are certainly lovers of good food (who isn't?). I made this reservation on our trip to Singapore to celebrate my dear husband's recent attainment of his fellowship and I think, from his enjoyment of the dinner, my choice was right.We had the eight course degustation with one wine pairing for all dishes and another for four dishes (chosen by the sommelier). The presentation of each dish was stunning and almost too precious that destroying the visage for consumption sake seemed like a sin but, oh, what guilty pleasures it brings. We were in food heaven- more than just tasty food, I thought we were part of the masterpiece being showcased.The service was impeccable. At times, though, we thought the servers could slow down their speech just a tad. But there was definitely a personal touch, especially as the dinner progressed and we got more conversational and bonded with one lovely server our love for Games of Thrones.The sommelier deserves a special mention. He was knowledgeable but not imposing or overbearing. And in no way did he make me feel "lowly" for taking a picture of each wine that we drank... just in case I want to source it myself!The special chocolate dessert with "congratulations" written on the side was such a lovely surprise and I am still in two minds if the beetroot or the egg is the best dish I have ever tasted. The only disappointment we have is that Chef Julien wasn't in the restaurant on the night we visited. We would have loved to meet the artist behind the masterpiece we just partook in.Price wise.. yes.. it is hefty... But this isn't a restaurant for everyday dining for most...unless of course you happen to be one of those rich kids of instagram or the 1%, in which case lucky you! The price does make me feel a little guilty about the decadence of the experience. Because of the price we may never visit again - not because we don't want to (the opposite is true! We want to eat like this everyday!) but because life is too short and we will like to seek out other gastronomic delights. However, our experience at Odette is simply unforgettable and we are glad to have savoured such amazing delights

I have very strong expectation of Odette after so many good words from friends and colleagues on Odette. However, I was left somewhat underwhelmed.Three days before I went to Odette, I had just dined at Jaan, the restaurant where Odette's Chef Julien Royer had come from prior to opening Odette. As such, I could not help but to compare Odette with Jaan.Overall, in my mind, if a chef is to leave a restaurant to open a new one, it should either be a largely different and more interesting menu than the previous; or the quality of food of the new restaurant is ten-fold better than the previous. Unfortunately, to me, Odette failed in fulfilling both points. I ordered the 8-course and many of the dishes were very similar to dishes in Jaan, even to the presentation and the theatrics. They are still good, but it makes me question the 2-star Michelin Odette received vis-a-vis Jaan's 1-star, as both are largely on-par.Furthermore, Odette does not have the help of the fantastic Singapore view that Jaan has, as such, I think it has to beef up its effort to differentiate itself further. The ambience is nothing to shout about as well -- pale in comparison, for example, to Violet Oon's National Kitchen (I know they are different restaurant concept, but the extent National Kitchen went for in term of decor and ambience is an example of how Odette could have brought itself to).In term of pricing, it is also on the high side. To make it worse, it was not clear on the menu that the cheese platter was an additional hefty sum on top of the already-expensive 8-course! That was the first time I had to pay such large sum for expensive degustation for cheese -- in many of the Michelin-star restaurants I have been to, typically it is an option, but not at additional charge; or at least it was stated very clearly of the additional cost. Oh, also some of the staff need to learn not to slur the menu or speak too fast -- we did not catch many of the dish descriptions because of this.That said, I just want to emphasise that the food is still of good quality. And Odette's sommelier is one of the most friendly and helpful I have met recently. Will I re-visit Odette? Most probably not, unless I hear feedback that the menu has been revised
5
Odette is a truly exceptional restaurant and restores my faith in ultra-fine dining after a fair few mediocre experience in the last year. Chef Julien Royer's food is the star of the show, as it should be, but it is backed up by an excellent front of house team and an exquisite dining room in grandest of locations, creating just the right ambience for a special occasion. Our waiter, Chen, was particularly impressive, demonstrating exemplary social awareness, offering just the right amount of attentiveness, humour and culinary understanding to elevate the the whole dining experience to truly world class levels. We also particularly liked the sommelier, who despite his youthful appearance, demonstrated an impressive fountain of knowledge without coming across as smug or precocious. The food it's self manages to accomplish a perfect mix of theatre and deliciousness. Think tablefuls of rosemary scented smoke coupled with mouthfuls of beautifully textured, creamy, crunchy perfection. It's of perhaps no surprise that the restaurant is housed in the National Gallery as artistry is certainly an appropriate word.All in all we were very happy with our experience and consider Odette to be one of the very best restaurants in the World. Having visited numerous 1,2 & 3 Michelin Starred restaurants in Asia, Europe and America, this is not just a unqualified sweeping statement, but a heartfelt appreciation for a group of people at the very top of their game. 
4
Four of us were here tonight to celebrate birthday. There were only 2 menu for the dinner, 6 course ($228) or 8 course ($268). We opted for the 8 course dinner. Like most Michelin star restaurants in Europe, the service is excellent and they will introduce each dish when they serve u. The food is nicely decorated and fairly tasty. A nice place to dine for special occasions.
3
I ate here in May and although the execution of the dishes was excellent, many of the dishes focused more on creativity over substance. The flavours were subtle and complex but I struggled to find a star or a shining example.Layerings of flavours worked but there was no examples of textures to help complete the mouth feel, everything was soft or pure or a light flake.Plays in temp were nice.A must try once to decide for yourself
4
Had a lovely meal here with a friend. Food was beautifully presented and interesting, but flavors were perhaps too subtle. The last savory course of pigeon served 3 ways was fantastic though. Price tag was very hefty at SGD280 for 8 courses, and not great value of money. Honestly, not quite up to snuff with the 2 Michelin starred restaurants in Europe eg. Ledbury.
5
Anniversary menu: amazing from A to Z. Interior just right: not too small, not too big. Same for staff: not too much, not too little.....: still amazed...
5
The restaurant interior is beautifully designed but the food is even more amazing. The signature starters, the beetroot variation and the rosemary smoked egg are the stand outs. The lemon tart dessert is also delightful both in terms of looks and flavour. Portions are just right and flavours are well-balanced. Indeed, one of Singapore's best restaurants
5
Was skeptical on the hype before I went. Amazing food and presentation especially the smoky rosemary and egg . This is one of the best in Singapore! One thing for improvement probably would be the service . Service is good , but would wish that the staffs engage in more conversation .
4
Probably one of the hardest places to get a table in Singapore at the moment and with due cause - this restaurant is newly anointed with two Michelin stars and set in very glamorous surrounds in the national gallery - wow factor galore! Staff are very friendly and well coached on the menu, though I get the impression this has been learned a little by rote rather than something they feel passionately about. The menu is exciting and has some real high notes, together with some adventurous choices in the wine flight that mostly came off - but not everything, hence the 4 out of 5 rather than top marks, particularly at this price point - personal faves were the mushroom soup, the fish and chicken courses and the epic cheese trolley - the rosemary egg on dry ice was however a little gimmicky and the dashi eel mix was not great - the wine list is scarily priced so wine flight is the better way to go. Would I go again? Probably not on my own dollar, for my money Jaan and Tippling Club are a little better value...
5
Lovely setting and a nice intimate restaurant with polite well presented staff. Choice of 6 course or 10 course menu. As they add in 4 other appetisers, palate cleansers etc it ends up being 10 and 14 courses. Lots of fun presentation and a great blend of tastes and flavours. The chocolate peanut butter dessert and the trout stood out for taste while the chicken course lacked flavour to the chicken but was well compensated by the sauce. Nice touch with the takeaway bag. For the theatre and mix would highly recommend
4
But not totally amazing so 4 stars. Booked for 2 for a special occasion. Restaurant is nice but a bit cold with high ceilings. Nice to see the kitchen from dining area. Food is good, creative but I won't be able to remember any dish, so probably lacking a true signature dish. Bill is expensive (1000$ for 2 with 1 bottle of wine). Service is fabulous. The table in the kitchen that staff accommodated for us for the dessert is an interesting experience 
5
My first dinner at Odette , and definitely not my last, though last night was maybe not a true representation of the restaurant as 2 star chef Julien Royer was sharing the cooking with the very talented 3 star chef Andreas Caminada from Switzerland.This is probably the best foodie restaurant I have dined at in Singapore. I love Les Amis though I haven't tried Joel Robuchon as of yet. In terms of service its tip top, the servers were extremely knowledgeable on all aspect of the dishes. The ambiance is fantastic for such a fine dining location as you are made to feel welcome and very comfortable from the moment you arrive. The pace of the meal was fantastic and the quality of cooking is second to none. A very light modern touch, skillful techniques and wonderfully balanced dishes. Odette earned 2 stars recently and rightly so . This is a very pleasurable dining experience from the amuse-bouche to the petit fours . its is definitely a place to impress your wife and/or your girlfriend :) One very small quibble is access as its a long stroll from the taxi stand on St. Andrews road . Its ok for us men but I can imagine it could be quite painful for the ladies in their Jimmy Choo's. Maybe there is a closer entrance but looking around at 11.00pm last night I could not find one
4
What i really liked was how cute some of the courses looked. There was a pokemon looking dessert, a starter that looks like a pillow cradling a golden pearl etc etc... and it all tastes as good as it looks!Odette is situated in the old parliament house turned museum and took a while to find as directions from the museum entrance were not clear. Ambience and interior design are very finely done with a view of the partially open kitchen. Service was good as expected of its fine dining status, but the thing that prevented me for giving the full 5 stars was i think the Captain or Asst. Manager who explained some dishes and took our wine order. Her tone was so condescending that it made me wonder if she thinks she is acting in some downtown abbey show talking to people of lower status. For a moment me and my wife were expecting her to start sniffing her nose at us after every sentence. Maybe because we are not their typical lawyer type guests, as we were in casual wear and taking photos of every single wonderful looking dishes. The normal servers were great though
4
I like the food since the Chef was with Jaan. I had the 8 course dinner before, didnt enjoy the dinner because the food is too much. I actually enjoyed the lunch better. If you go for lunch, take the 4 course, value for money and just nice to fill up the stomach. Nice and romantic restaurant... especially if your table is nearer to the private room side.
5
other than a little hiccup with regard to our religious dietary restrictions, which was more than compensated for by the care and attention given to my wife's gluten free requirements, this really was a perfect mealI was a little nervous as I so wanted the meal to be perfect, and we were all stunned when it wasit is rare to dine in a restaurant where the food is so exquisite, and yet find that the service actually exceeds the culinary aspects of the experience, but this was the case here - I am not exaggerating when I say that the quality of the service was the finest I have ever experienced - Odette may be rate Michelin 2 star, but the service team is definitely 3 starit was an added bonus to discover that the sommelier was a fellow West Country-man!
3
I like the décor albeit rather bright lighting. Enjoyed the variety of bread. Food was okay but not over the top. Felt rather let down after the rave reviews and the huge bill. Better options in town for that hefty price range.
5
Must order the most expensive menus to try everything. Even the bread selection is exceptional. The service is beyond my expectations. You even get a bottle of homemade jam as a takeaway gift.
5
We had a marvellous Saturday lunch recently. The dining room was buzzy but tranquil, the service was very attentive, friendly but not over familiar. They made the occasion special. The tasting menu was varied and catered for different dietary constraints. Each dish was excellent, especially the slow cooked egg, and the various breads were amazing. The desserts and cheese course were also quite delicious. We thoroughly enjoyed it and can't wait to go back again
5
Had a wonderful lunch with my girlfriends. We were deciding on whether to have the 4 or 6 course lunch and am very glad we decided on the former as we were completely stuffed after our meal! Service was flawless and the food was delicious with surprisingly large portions. Wine was a bit on the pricey side but pretty normal for that calibre of restaurant. I'll definitely be back again
4
From the amuse bouche of mushroom soup served with brioche, to the fantastic Iberico pork main course with wine pairing, my girlfriend and I enjoyed the experience, both the ambience and the food, very much! The servers were kind enough to explain the dishes to us and our glasses of water and wine were never empty. One regret though that Chef Julien was not present in the open kitchen that Saturday lunch, on the 27/8! We spent total of $400, nearly worth every cent, I will recommend it to others for their magnificent lunch sets, and will definitely return for their degustation dinner
5
We received a very warm greeting as we arrived, which is always a good start. The dining room is very elegant and the ambience exactly what you'd expect from a 2 Michelin star establishment.We opted for the 6 course tasting menu at lunchtime. Every dish is spectacularly presented without being gimmicky or pretentious - just exquisitely prepared with outstanding flavour and, for me at leat, spot-on portion sizes. There were 'snacks' prior to the first course arriving and then several amuse bouches / palette cleansers between courses.As for price; an expensive lunch by anybody's standard but in my view perfectly good value considering the quality of both of the food and the service
5
A good friend hosted my wife and I to lunch at this restaurant last Wednesday. Not having familiarised myself with the recent list of restaurants conferred by Michelin, I was unaware that this restaurant has just been awarded 2 Michelin Stars. When we arrived at the reception, it was immediately apparent that the is a fine dining restaurant with the hostess greeting and showing us to our table. The ambience was elegantly low key. As I learnt subsequently, we were lucky to be seated in one of the tables with a view of the kitchen, but still not near enough to observe the dextrous working of the chefs. We each ordered the set lunch of 4 Acts for SGD 88++. My wife and I ordered different dishes so that we can share and savour as many flavours as possible. The waiters and waitresses were very attentive and efficient and we were asked what we would like to drink immediately after we sat down. Then came the sommelier, my next favourite person after the chef. The choice of wines was decent but not that fantastic although I appreciated that it has a few half bottles and also wines by the glass. We started with a French sparkling wine which was quite nice and followed by an aged Rioja. The Rioja was perhaps a bit too aged and lacking in fruits but nonetheless drinkable. We were served with 3 varieties of bread accompanied by unsalted French butter and a spread made from pork lard. The dark rye bread was my favourite. The butter was soft and tasty but I found the lard abit too porky for me. Maybe it needed an acquired taste. I had the octopus, foie grah and Iberico pork neck. The dishes were very well presented and delicious. My only grouse, if at all, was that each of the dishes came with a variety of mostly mild flavours, and although they all blended together seamlessly and harmoniously, but not a single flavour struck me as outstanding and memorable. Maybe this was a drawback from being so successful in creating so many different flavours and having them all at once or in close succession. My dessert was strawberry prepared in a few ways and were all good. Tea or coffee were not included in the set lunch. Although we did not mind paying for them, but it would be a good gesture to throw in tea or coffee in the deal. BTW, the semi circular and quartered bench chairs were not comfortable and did not even provide decent lumbar support. My choice of dining chairs must have good lumbar support and arm rests. All in all, the service was excellent and the food was good. An affordable 2 Stars Michelin Restaurant.

This one stands out for many reasons. Firstly. True service has usually been sold out to casual hipster whatever. Not here all the service, pride and quality. The staff are shining with pride and elegance. Well done. The food is of course exceptional and the wine list great for amateur and wine snob alike. Make the effort and enjoy.

Another great work by Julien Royer; was inpressed by his exquisite food art at Jaan previously and another reason more to visit Odette. It's located in National Gallery of Singapore where you can end your food journey with some of the great historical relic displays, really nice combo! I cant decide the signature 55" egg (which I don't wish to miss again) or the foie gras from the lunch set so the chef worked out a custom-made of both and it was a good deal. The fresh and refined interior layout plus a superb view watching the chefs in the glass kitchen, I would highly recommend for its lunch set
4
The place is nice and warm, the food is beautiful and delicious. It would be much better if the service can be more touched, they almost forgot my luggage left in the front desk and they really forgot the bread we are supposed to take away
3
After receiving 2 Michelin Stars I just had to book in to this spot. The restaurant decor and food presentation was exceptional but food was only decent. I enjoyed it overall but the whole experience was a little lower than my expectation (which might have been set too high following the Michelin review). Good vibe overall
4
A much awaited dining experience as you have to book a month or more in advance for a table. I loved the decor, the ambiance and the food (taste, presentation and value) even though it turns out Chef Julien was not in town that day.Would have scored the experience better if the service was as Michelin star worthy. The local lady at the front desk was unfriendly and somewhat snooty though the foreign gentleman at the front desk was warm and genuinely hospitable - exactly what one would expect from a fine dining restaurant. The service staff at my table was impatient to clear the table between courses. At one point, i held up the last bit of food from my plate, haven't yet sent it to my mouth and she swooped to clear the plates. It would also help if it was easier to understand that particular service staff's enunciation when describing our food. I would head back to try again and hope to have the Michelin star experience I know they are worthy of
3
We heard so much about this wonderful restaurant that our expectation was high before we stepped into the place that is very hard to book. It is housed in the newly opened National Gallery. Vaulted ceilings and cathedral windows add a sense of class and nobility to the venue. The food, however, is not as elevated as we have hoped. My guests and I couldn't find any particular praises to sing after the lunch
5
Ever since Chef Julien opened Odette I've always been interested in trying.When Odette received glowing 2 Michelin stars I just have got to get there.We opt for the 8 course menu for lunch (because dinner was already booked out for the whole week) and everything was impeccable.The ambience, decor, service and of course the food, surpassed all expectation.Seemed like even if you're bad in taking pictures, the food shot would still be gorgeous. And if you have a fussy palate, you would find that they were all mild, harmonious and just right. I especially loved the choconuts with tonka bean ice cream. It was amazing, to say the least, the harmony of flavours were so unbelievably delicate and complimenting each other. It was THE dessert that perfectly a finale to outstanding series of meal it literally injected happiness in us. That was lunch par excellence
5
This was our second visit. We decided on the 8 course Chef's menu, which was out of this world, and portion size just right. Our favourites: Hokkaido Uni, Heirloom Beetroot Variation, Crispy Skinned Kinmedai, 'BBQ' Pegeon Fabien Deneour, which all worked very well with the wine pairing. The service was a delight, probably the best in town. The restaurant setting in the National Gallery is just perfect, easy to get to and easy parking. If you have something special to celebrate, this is the place to go. Will be interesting to see when they get their 3rd Michilin star
5
We booked a lunch for 2 for my husband´s birthday the day after Odette was awarded with 2 Michelin´s stars. We had high expectations and were not disappointed. We went for the 6 courses lunch set, one normal and one vegetarian. We also had cheese. We definitely ate too much but it was so worth it. The chef knows how to treat your palate! Service is discrete and professional.If I may express my very much personal point of view, plates are very different from each other in terms of ingredients and tastes, unlike in other gourmet restaurants don´t expect a common story in the menu, Chef Julien cooks each dish with a very own personnality. I am a big fan so I will not hesitate to recommend this place to any fine gourmet person.Small tip - request for the table in front of the kitchen, it is very interesting to observe the ballet happening inside there
5
What can I say that hasn't already been said about this incredible restaurant. Chef Julien and his team deserve every twinkle of their 2 Michelin Stars. It's hard to see how they could make any more improvement - which is remarkable since they only opened seven months ago. I've had the privilege to dine in most of Singapore's top restaurants and Odette is without doubt the finest of them all, especially for those extra-special celebrations and anniversaries. You may not get the spectacular views of he Singapore skyline but you will be enthralled and excited by every tantalizing mouthful. The culinary experience is worth far more than any light show or firework display and the soothing ambiance of the restaurant is absolutely delightful.If your credit card can stand it, I wholly recommend the Tasting Menu, which showcases the very best of Chef Julien's mastery of ingredients and flavours. There is simply no compromise between his creative idea on the plate and the enjoyment on your palate. You will ooh and aah at every mouthful as each exquisitely presented course brings an explosion of taste and nostalgia.I wish the whole team at Odette every success as they strive for their third coveted star. I have no doubt they will earn it. They truly deserve every accolade they receive for their skill, passion and dedication to perfection
5
Just had a fabulous meal in Odette. For any occasion, this is the place to go to. Chef Julien and his team make dining a delightful and enriching experience! By far the best dining experience in town. Deserves its recently awarded 2 Michelin Stars (and if you ask me, a 3rd one).
5
Me and my son were visiting Singapore, and a very old friend told us how he love this restaurant, he made a surprise reservation before we arrived and it was really a nice surprise, we took the menu and it was very creative, in presentation and taste. The service was done by a very nice lady, we had a private room all to ourselves. They were awaiting the visit of Michelin and hoping for one stars. well the last I heard they got 2 stars. So bravo
5
Location: Situated within National Gallery. Easily accessible by MRT at City Hall Station. You may park your car at National Gallery, Parliament House and The Adelphi.Restaurant Staff: Friendly, welcoming and attentive. Know the dishes very well. Able to share about the dishes to whet our appetite. Well dressed and presentable.Food: Very pretty presentation of food! Food is yum! You may choose different number of courses. Love their basket of bread!Overall: Had a wonderful experience of fine dining at this nicely decorated restaurant. Enjoyed their services and will definitely go back for more with friends

We had a great dinner experience at Odette. Tasting menu was a progressive delight with variated and fine tastes.
Only reserve is about the wine list which is not approachable and may be considered as overpriced.
5
Everything is melt in your mouth. Loved the food, the presentation is amazing. Flavours and menu is incredibly well thought through and developed. Good service too! Well trained western style😄
5
One of the top five meals I have enjoyed in Singapore. Great presentation, wonderful flavors, excellent wine selection and attentive service.
5
We had the most delicious meal that we've had since we visit Andre a few years ago. Odette has a beautiful, clean, warm atmosphere with very thoughtful, attentive staff and an outstanding menu that is a surprise with each course. Outstanding in every way.
4
from the entrance, sense of arrival, to the decor,simple and refreshing, to the food presentation and tastes, very creative, it is a culinary explosion and experience of the senses.
5
Went there for dinner with wife and tried their 6 course degustation meal! Everything is meticulously prepared and presented. Their bread is one of the best I have tried and the WOW factor certainly makes the whole dining experience a special time there!The two ladies who served our table are well presented and apart from the washroom facilities (which you would need to walk OUT of the restaurant and utilise those within the National Gallery), I would give the whole dining experience a mighty ten! Of course, the homemade sweet jam is something not to be missed on your way out finishing off!For first-timers, ask your taxi to drop you off at the National Gallery of Singapore - if you say 1 St Andrew's Road, you might be shipped to a location a little bit further away!Highly recommended and not to be missed for fine dining lovers
5
We had a wonderful time in Odette (located within the National Gallery of Singapore / Old Supreme Court) and enjoyed every moment in this opulent restaurant on Valentine's Day 2016!You could tell upon entering the restaurant that the management paid great detail to every part of the process to make a diner feel comfortable and pampered. From the elegant decors to the exquisite wines and amazingly presented food, everything was WOW from the get go!I give two thumbs up (Which is all the thumbs I have on my person...LOL) to the Management, Chef Julian and lovely service staff in Odette for my wonderful dining experience.We even got a bottle of homemade sweet jam on our way out. Talk about making the customer feel special. :DThank you once again for customizing the dessert to include a special message to my wife on our special day.Salut!PS: If you have the time before dinner (i.e. Sunset's golden hour), do take the lift to the rooftop area for a spectacular view of some famous Singapore Landmarks
5
Fine dining is not really my kind of thing, I've tried it across major cities around the world; I often find the whole experience too formal, overtly staged and a slightly stiff (I have to laugh very gently just to fit in). However not here at Odette - the ambience was cozy while understatedly-beautifully decorated, the interactions with staff member were intuitive and full of humor. Steven was such a great host, and Yelicia - a big clap for 新加坡! The food...it was literally like tasting arts and swallowing parts of Chef Julien (please don't read this any other way). What an awesome experience! Thank you Chef, thank you Team Odette
5
I ate herein a party of 5, all of them dedicated foodies. The 8 course meal ranks among the top 3 of my life, and everyone else thought the same.The staff were very concerned to ensure that the set menu didn't cause any problems, and there were substitutes for such few problems as we had. Overall, the level of service was superb, attentive and knowledgeable without being intrusive.There's not much point in describing the individual dishes (let alone the many pre and in between tastes), as the menu changes constantly. It's enough to say that each, like the service, was superb.The decor is beautiful - relaxing but elegant. The tables are so arranged that you don't have any intrusion from conversation at the others, but at the same time, the atmosphere is anything but dead.The wine list is extensive. As many have remarked, many of the wines are expensive, but then, the best always is.If you like fine dining, this place is a must for Singapore - in my view, top of the list, and by a clear margin. It's expensive, but the freshness and quality of the ingredients, coupled with the sheer excellence of the cuisine, helps to explain why. And as with the wines, the best is expensive. And in the result, the value is there for what you get.I can't wait to return on my next visit to Singapore
5
Excellent ambience for dining, excellent location at the beautiful National Gallery. Food was well presented, with a touch of theatre, and tasted even better! Lots of textures and flavours on each plate that was served. The staff were knowledgeable about the plates, and certainly attentive to the diners. Overall we had a marvelous experience and will return again
5
Scores on all fronts - great taste, presentation and service by professional staff. Decor is simple but elegant.
5
I've tried the 6 courses menu. Overall food quality was nice and fresh. The presentation was also great but nothing beyond expectation. What I love the most about this place is the jam they gave us as a souvenir, very yummy.
5
Julien continues to delight with his thoughtful Cusine. Service was very good and knowledgeable. Been with business friends and with my wife and each time the ambience and food made for a great occasion.
5
By its location, its renowned chef, the quality of the staff and the price of the menu Odette surely aim quite high; and probably reach the top 5 of the restaurants of the island.So I can make a very short review : it is very good but also very pricey and you have to be picky not to have a great diner there.This said, I will try to make this a bit longer. On weekends only the 8 course menu is served for diner. Without being hasty the service was efficient enough to brought us through our culinary journey in less than 3 hours, which I was thankful off.I must say that everything was done to perfection with (I hope) top most ingredients and a lot of labor. On the 8 courses I could only remember 3 the next day: the house signature slow cooked egg (tasty and playful); the pigeon breast was cooked to perfection (but cannot beat Carlo Crisciâ€™s one) and the gritty vision of the talon still attached to the leg was on the verge of bad taste, finally the fish with crispy skin and bouillabaisse was my favorite dish. The first two starters were good, but too complex and easily forgotten (and it is a pity to forget you had some caviar oscietre). The desert also excellent, was also easily forgotten, a bit too minimalistic maybe.The wine list is comprehensive and also on the high end, although with a bit of imagination you can find very decent wines at a close to conventional price (Our bottle of Condrieu was close to the price in lesser restaurants). The service is as good as it gets thanks notably to the manager Steven, and the presence of check Julien Royer who often pops out of his kitchen to serve some dishes and some small talk. The dining room itself is a bit disappointing, we though our table, though booked more than 2 month in advance was poorly located but actually the arrangement of place does not seem offer some extraordinary sittings (apart maybe from the table in the kitchen)So overall, this is a great place, worth visiting. I am not sure how often you can go and if the menu will change often enough to entice diners for more frequent visit. The price tag is bit too high as well (this is of course relative),and having the choice of the 6 course may also facilitate my return
5
The ambiance and atmosphere are pleasant, as soon as you enter this restaurant it makes you feel relax. We have got an impressive degustation menu with that feeling of getting punch by so many gorgeous flavours and savours, each bites bring you to heaven. My favorite was the -pancetta wrapped scallops- a perfect blend between softness, crispiness and saltiness top up with black truffles. I loved the Foie Gras too, and also the lobster in bouillabaisse. I am usually not a big fan of dessert, but I really enjoyed theirs, refreshing and not heavy, I have got the strawberries Mille Feuilles, even though I was already full I couldn't stop eating it.The choices of all their ingredients are amazing. The wine list is good, I love the idea of the Champagne trolley which gives you a choice of 5 champagnes by the glass for the aperitif. The selection is excellent and off the beaten track with Cedric Bouchard, Giraud, Gonet, Chartogne taillet and Krug! The service is excellent, the staff is knowledgable and passionated (so rare in Singapore). I was invited but I can imagine the bill, yes it's pricy but so worth it! It's an experience! I want to go back I would be ready to prepare the wallet for it.

Well, I don't write many reviews, but I got to tell : I had 2 wonderful experiences at Odette in 6 months-time and yet still can't get enough, I have to fly from Shanghai to Singapore to purposely come for dinner, exactly like a bird flying back to his nest. The food is incredibly high in quality, the freshest in town. we straight see that vegetables&fruits have been carefully picked in a skilled-gardener traditional patch. then the Meat / fish are obviously coming from nature-lover fishermen / farmers, and the alliance with these very-hard-to-find fresh seasonal herbs is JUST a blast. Chef Julien Royer really deserves a Michelin star for his tremendous creativity. Not to mention the awesome Odette staff (all of them, but particularly Yelicia) showing full passion serving dishes in a perfect tempo. All cheerful and eager to make your experience fantastic, while kitchen chefs under Julien Royer's command, are cooking with impressive stealth. I did really appreciate the little gift box right before I stepped out of the restaurant. I'm counting my days till the day I'll be back to have my 3rd round. I'd conclude : It's not allowed to have a such high level

Odette's is truly excellent. The decor is beautiful (love the colour palette) and the staff is friendly and highly professional. Presentation of food is of course faultless, and all of the eight courses were a delight (aside for the pigeon and it's claw...). Fabulous wines. So you are wondering why 4 and not 5 stars and that is because Odette's is simply overpriced and we actually regret going. We have been fortunate enough to dine at many of the world's top restaurants and I never felt this way. Also 8 courses were too much and by the end it was a struggle, 6 courses on a Saturday should also be an option. So yes, Odette's is fabulous, but for me it was not worth the price.
5
The food looks too good to eat but actually tastes much better than it looks. There was a choice of an 8 course non-vegetarian or vegetarian menu and l the chef to take you on the journey like you haven't experienced before.Incredible fantastic magnificent

I knew that this was going to be an extravagance but I have been looking forward to dinner at the National Gallery. The building is a quite spectacular relic of colonial times which has been painstakingly restored but this restaurant has the feel of a pop up with strange curtains and screens adorning the walls. It's all bland beige and cream and leaves one rather underwhelmed in expectation of hopefully some true art in the form of imaginatively prepared great French good. Sadly, the chef panders to the micro-biological fad that has taken over the world of modern cuisine with far too much focus on theatricals including voloutes, foams, and the ubiquitous dry ice. Personally, I was disappointed. The preliminary courses of the tasting menus so inconsequential as to leave one champing at the bit for some real food. My sea urchin in foam was distinctly overly pungent. When the fish arrived, it was perfectly acceptable with a crispy edible skin, but it was bland and could have done with some accompanying flavour and colour to raise the spirits. The staff had no idea what it was. The main course was a disappointing pigeon, hardly the most appetising dish at the best of times and in this case perfectly cooked but again with little to make it memorable in its presentation or accompaniments. The claw was also still attached to the wretched bird. The cheese trolley was a welcome burst of flavour although there was a lack of decent hard cheese. Desert was utterly forgettable. Over all, the whole experience was disappointing. Value for money this place must rank as one of the most grotesquely overpriced places on the island. It's one redeeming feature was the services which was proficient
5
We went for our 15th wedding anniversary and I could not have been happier! Friendly staff greeting when we arrived. The timing of the courses being sent out to us was perfect. The presentation was art! The wine pairings with each course were amazing! I know very little about wine but I know what I like. The choices given to us were like the icing on the cake. They added that extra something to complete the dish. It would be hard for me to pick a favorite as far as which course I liked best. It was all so good. The service, presentation, ambience and food were all fabulous! It was a delicious dining experience and I definitely recommend going. I know we will be back!
4
Good food though the presentation of some dishes seemed too dramatic and pretentious . Quality and well prepared food but expensive. overall, a nice restaurant if you don't mind the cost and are not looking for a cosy ambience.
3
I must say. Great ambience and staff. Overall a good experience but not enough for the price you pay. I found the food to be average and frankly price over the top.
5
Been to Odette for a few times now since it opened last year. It is fairly expensive but worth it. Aside from the mains, I love all the amuse bouches and the palate cleansers. One tip- their bread is lovely with the seaweed butter which is usually automatically served with the vegetarian set. If you are non-veg, request for the seaweed butter. It's heads and shoulders better than the unsalted butter + lard that they provide.
5
I've always been a fan of Chef Julien since his days at Jaan, but this was my first visit to Odette. We had the 8-course menu, which filled us to the brim. The food, as always, was consistent, reliable, and creative. An absolute joy to admire the meticulous presentation of each dish and indulge in the premium quality of its ingredients. While some may argue that the ingredients used are not unique, to me however, the ability to turn simple, everyday ingredients in the likes of egg, beetroot, mushrooms etc, into beautifully and creatively plated dishes which taste exceptional awesome is a reflection of the chef's creativity, his passion, his skills and his attention to detail -- all of these qualities which Chef Julien clear demonstrates in his menu. Service-wise, it was professional and friendly. Restaurant decor is minimalist yet elegant. Overall, I would say the price is reasonable. My husband and I certainly enjoyed a most satisfying dining experience

Odette is everything you would want from a fine dining restaurant in Singapore with the exception of the sommelier who doesn't know how to pair wine and food. Chef Julian (ex Jaan) has created an amazingly tasty menu for both meat eaters and vegetarians. GM Steven did an incredible job of saving our night and took over sommelier duties after the 3 of the first 4 courses had wine that didn't match the food. The sommelier seemed to take exception to the feedback (some of the feedback was from someone who i training to be a sommelier so it wasn't just me who noticed!) and Steven calmed things down and took over. He understood immediately what wines matched and what didn't and didn't put a foot wrong from that moment on. Steven also has that personable charisma of a professional GM who knows how to handle clients and what to do and say at all times. Exceptional service by him.Only small criticism of the food is that 2/3 of the courses were the same as Julian's previous restaurant Jaan. This is fine as they were his creations there and very tasty but new restaurant, new venue, surely brand new menu too?Highly recommend nonetheles
4
The interior is gorgeous when bathed in natural light. Being given one of the tables facing the entrance, it was awkward to have every curious passerby look right in to watch you eating. Otherwise, the food was delicious in part, and above average elsewhere, save for the Hida wagyu which was overtly greasy and served in a rather odd way - all rolled up and stuffed with random raw greens that appeared on just about every dish. I was expecting a little more, but the personal touch afforded by the chef who served us nearly half the courses can just make me overlook this slight disappointment
3
Odette came highly recommended but I found it to be over the top pretentious, trying too hard and ridiculously pricey. It was all form with little interesting content. The space is beautiful in the new National Gallery but the focus seems to be placed on gimmicky presentations like dry ice and egg cartons while the food combinations are confusing and muddled and often not very tasty. The number of chefs in the kitchen is staggering. The head chef should refocus their efforts on the food and tone down the over the top presentation. Otherwise it will continue to be mostly form with little content
3
There is lots of flash and smoke an mirrors but I am not sure the food lives up to flash. Dry ice, smoked Rosemary eggs etc. Once you have seen it at other tables the flash wears off. Some of the food textures and combinations just don't work. You have a choice of a 6 or 8 course menu. Even though we provided dietary restrictions in advance they did not seem to be aware. They quickly recovered and changed a couple of dishes. Service is "French" with lots of pomp and ceremony to plate delivery. Not sure if they are really interested in your enjoyment. The price is crazy and the wine is unbelievably priced. I don't think that it is worth the money and would not return.
5
After having experienced the chef's cuisine at Jaan, and after being amazed by it, we decided to give a try to Odette. And we were not disappointed. The atmosphere is a bit different, more cosy and feminine. And the food is still absolutely wonderful. Tastes, colors, textures... Everything is beyond perfect. We could not ask for more. Odette is a dream. Merci 
5
Yup! Twice in four days. Twice in a one week visit to Singapore. I have to admit that the second time was a bit of an accident. We were supposed to take friends to lunch at Odette and then they couldn't make it, so too shy to cancel the hard to get booking, we just went again. The chef saw us and made a special, completely different menu for us this time. And delicious it was!!The food is all finesse, technique that supports the produce instead of overwhelming it (as is sadly so often the case), beautiful flavours, interesting presentations, impeccable service. If I lived in Singapore, this would become my local!
5
The restaurant serves up great fusion cuisine-- special mention to the truffle mushroom soup, the rich truffle flavour blends well with the smooth mushroom cream. Service is excellent and price is very reasonable for a good serve up during lunch.
5
We've returned to live in Singapore after a few years in New York. We were convinced that we wouldn't be able to enjoy the same level of fine dining that New York's best restaurants offered, but went to Odette on a friend's advice. We were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food and the wine. We opted for the 6 course menu as the beef entree sounded more appetising than the the pigeon one offered on the 8 course. We also decided to give the wine pairing a shot. We felt the food was cooked very well indeed. Aforementioned beef was juicy and nicely seasoned with salt, preceding dishes of char, mushrooms, scallop and egg were done with finesse and the presentation was also awesome. Chef royer personally presented some of the dishes, which is something that would almost never happen in a New York restaurant. I thought it was great that he made time to interact with the guests. Wine pairings were also managed expertly to complement the food. We enjoyed some wines we hadn't tried before including an interesting unfiltered Sauvignon Blanc from Australia. Service was conscientious and polite. Some servers made some attempt at banter, a rather unusual but welcome development in the Singapore waiting scene! The restaurant was bathed in soothing neutral colours. It definitely had the fine dining feel about it. Odette also gave us some parting gifts, which we felt were a nice touch and again reminiscent of the practices of top restaurants in other places. Will definitely come back

I made reservations for this place as soon as I heard that he had left Jaan. The restaurant is very pretty, in muted cream colours and well sound proofed for a very intimate experience. In fine French tradition, they start you off with champagne or cocktail. I won't recall the menu for you as it varies. The food was interesting. One of my complaints (my only reservation) about Jaan was the sole use of French ingredients. Odette plays with regional foodstuff. If I had to compare to Jaan though I would say Jaan's food was a cut above (I know, I'm never happy). However the wine pairings we enjoyed with the food really elevated the meal. There were dishes, such as the smoked beet which I wouldn't have enjoyed if not paired with an oaked (smokey) chardonnay. In the end, we had a wonderful meal and left the restaurant mildly buzzed, comfortably full and with great memories - that's a successful dinner. One of the top restaurants/chef in Singapore. We will be back

A great dining experience comprises of many ingredients. Odette received great reviews and here is another one that aims to outline why it is currently Singapore's premier Fine Dining venue.The Food: Presentation, choice of ingredients, portion size, and menu design are clever and executed with pride (...for every table...). Chef Julien Royer managed to deliver a high quality menu with some stunning visual effects in a relaxed setting that could compete very well with any Michelin star fine dining venue in the world. Some signature Royer creations like the 55 minutes Smoked Organic Eggs that have been prepared at 65.3 degrees and presented in an egg tray with dried ice transforming your table to "Cirque de Odette" are being served besides a host of other innovative creations. And did I mentioned the selection of bread and butter? The Beverages: A smart wine menu with a good selection of wines and champagnes. The People: From the time you make your booking, to the welcome, the service, and the farewell you will experience that the team at Odette complements the high food quality. Joanna, the "angel" at reception will likely manage your reservation and welcome you in a smart, warm and professional manner. Our waitress was Eileen who turned out to be passionate and highly knowledgeable about the various dishes. Beyond this, Eileen was charming and the perfect ambassador not only for Odette but Singapore's ability to produce excellent service staff (Singapore Airlines would love to recruit her...). She was supported by a team of equally dedicated team members that aimed to please and provide a highly pleasant dining experience.The venue: Odette is in a great venue (inside Singapore's new National Gallery) but is likely nicer during the day with daylight than at night (the lighting could be improved to create a better ambiance).The verdict: It is the combination of excellence in food and service that puts Odette to the top position of Singapore's Fine Dining scene. It is an excellent product with a fair price and an outstanding team that truly works hard to make every guest's dining experience memorable. It is very hard to imagine that anybody would not be impressed with Odette (especially if one would have sampled all of Singapore's top 20 Fine Dining venues). At present, it truly deserves to be called the "premier" spot in this great city that is known for being a culinary melting pot and top destination in this world

The space and deco is spiffy, the service attentive and friendly, the food is ok. Menu is fixed, choice of $88++ for 4-course lunch and $128++ for 6-course lunch. We had both and preferred the 4-course menu. It's good food, fancy presentation but I expected a bit more oomph for the price. The atmosphere is cozy but a little too open for a 'nice quiet chat' kind of meal. Overall it was a nice experience

Didn't know about odette until a friend grandson mention to his grandmother that he wish to din there but is too expensive for him, and have to book weeks ahead.Well that make many people curious about the restaurant but for me unless it has a history otherwise I don't border.Anyway on the Easter Saturday we thought we go to national gallery for lunch there are few restaurant to choose. We walk to odette on the first floor the lady told us they full, but there's one table no show yet and ask us to check again by 1.30 pm . So we thought we try violet oon on the 2nd floor the building is so hugh we have to slowly ask and follow sign.Just as we ask a table for two in violet oon restaurant the lady in odette call me and ask to go there immediately.So of cause we head straight because we really want to try the food in odette to taste what they serve. For lunch 2 set meal $128 & $188. 6&8 course.++They give us two appetizers which is not on the menu and a cleanse on top of the six course.Every dish is well presented, and explain in detail to us. And the cutlery that serve the food is so beautiful.Is quite a good experience and the staff is friendly.Is fine dinning everything serve is very small, is more of a design, fashion too nice to eat, but is enough to fill the stomach.Personally don't think I go back again. Is a good experience.

it's quite difficult to get a table in this restaurant, we booked for lunch three weeks in advance. the lunch menu is quite a good deal at 88++ for four courses. I honestly think this is one the most competent french dining experiences in singapore and the prices are fair. we had the beef tartare, saba, sous-vide egg, asparagus, char, pork jowls. for dessert mille feuille and a citrussy dessert. all the dishes were competent, creative and tasted goo

Julien Royer delivered again. Odette was arguably the most talked about new restaurant opening for many years. Reservation was almost impossible, but I managed to finally got one mid week, and it did not disappoint, in fact, it exceeded my expectation in the food, the service, the décor and the ambiance. One thing that was a bit lacking was the wine paring. The som tried to introduce some more eclectic selections, but when paired with the food, they did not shine through. However, I would go back again, as soon as I can manage to get another reservation. The food was that good, and the overall experience, wine included, was that good
5
After my dinner on Friday I could understand the wait for one month. Service was excellent.With deconstructed food sometimes flavours are sacrificed. It is not the case here. The food looks great and tastes good.A small mistake was made. Service recovery was prompt. I declined the waiver of the two meals but was persuaded to accept waiver of one. It was really unnecessary as my enjoyment of the dining experience was not at all affected.Odette has a good future. It should be able to get into the top 50 in Asia and get 1 or more Michelin stars.

Since its opening, Chef delivers his promises to bring the best and most exquisite seasonal produces to us in Singapore. Hokkaido uni, caviar from La Maison Nordique, Saint-Géry ham from Patrick Duler, black and white winter truffles from Perigord and Alba, Hokkaido abalone, Brittany blue lobster with romanesco, porc noir de Bigorre, langoustine royale, wild caught John Dory in dolce forte, Atlantic whiting fish, cod and turbot, pourlarde de Bresse in classic albufera etc. all prepared and cook in traditional way as well as with a modern touch. For the love of cuisine, if we strip off the marketing and promotional aspect of a restaurant and the chef's cooking philosophy and techniques...what do we get? It's simply the pursuit of honest and high quality produces that sets a cuisine apart from the rest. Ask any top chefs around the world, nothing is more important that the respect for high quality produces and THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO EXPERIENCE CONSISTENTLY IN ODETTE. Speak to the sommelier for wine pairings and/or bottles not in the wine list to further enhance your gastronomic experience and don't forget the Bernard Anthony cheese board

This is a small and elegant restaurant. My husband and I ordered the 4- and 6-course lunch sets. Every dish was delicious and beautifully presented. Service was excellent. Highly recommended and reservations are definitely a must.
5
I am no expert in the new "fashionable" French food with all its foam and minute proportions. Had an inkling that I might walk out of this restaurant hungry but I was wrong. I was happy and very much satiated! The food was excellent as was the service. And it is located in a lovely building. The decor of this place is also very pleasing and I would call it understated elegance. It is not cheap but then, Singapore IS one of the most expensive cities! Yes, I would recommend this place. Great job, Odette
5
What a memorable meal! The decor is crisp, formal yet understated and comfortable. The service is impeccable - attentive in every way. There is only one word to describe the food and wine pairings - exquisite! We had the 8 course dinner. Each dish was beautifully created. My favourites were the organic egg dish, pigeon and the duck. They have a lovely private room that seats 8-12 that was perfect for our celebratory dinner.
5
This was one of the best meals I've had in Singapore. We went on a Saturday night after a three month wait to get a booking. The service was friendly and efficient. At night the only choice is an 8 course meal although a vegetarian option is available which I chose. The plates were beautifully presented and overall the meal wasn't too heavy. The normal me menu included pigeon which was quite rare (as recommended by the chef). Wine pairing is available. The cheese platter looked lovely..Whilst not a cheap night (S$258 per head with the vegetarian option being S$10 cheaper excluding drinks it is with trying for a special occasion

Dining at Odette is a beautiful experience. I had high expectations of the food from the very beginning given Chef Julien’s experience but I went to dine with an open mind. My expectations were nothing more than what I had experienced at Jaan, previously helmed by the same chef.I was thrilled with the hand dived Scottish scallops whose freshness made my mouth sing with joy along with the candied hazelnut crumble. The fish took my focus from the conversation at the table to be completely absorbed by the distinct flavours on my plate. Here was a dish that captured my full attention. The main course was smoked Bresse duck served in two ways, and this one plate was able to bring alive the festive season in Europe.We all know that that a chef who wins awards will deliver great food, but the main difference at Odette is the staff. Each sommelier, each bus boy, the hostesses, and the team in the kitchen seem to all have extra spirit and warmth.Fine dining restaurants in the past have been quite ostentatious and daunting. The appeal with Odette is that the space flows and is light, airy and filled with a team who are genuinely warm and hospitable, who go out of their way to make you feel at home. It appears they have set a new standard in fine dining. One extreme is casual fine dining, minus table cloths and all the extras, to the other end of the spectrum - the old world of stuffy fine dining where you feel aware of every move you make and don’t want to laugh too loudly for fear of disturbing people.At Odette, the food, the ambience and the warm and friendly team make fine dining a pure delight. A comfortable, seamless experience where you are made to feel welcome and laugh wholeheartedly if something gives you joy. It is a unified effort between the kitchen and the front of house staff that results in a truly memorable meal. Everything is taken care of.Dining at Odette is an experience you will enjoy from the moment you set foot inside the beautiful restaurant. It comes with my highest recommendation
5
I took a reservation a month in advance and it was well worth the wait. We had a 4-course business lunch. All the dishes were a work of art. The taste was delectable and complex. There was no false step, we liked all the dishes.The service is quite good. They wrote a 'happy birthday' message on my dessert plate, a nice touch.I look forward to going here again, this time for dinner
5
I had a wonderful experience from start to finish at Odette with some friends recently. From the elegant, romantic decor and location, to the scrumptious 7, perhaps it was 8 course (I lost count) meal, to the seamless service we had - I must say it was a meal to remember. It's been a while since I've had a dining experience that ticks all the boxes.I just love that every plate looked like a piece of art. Just too good to eat! That first bite is just a tastebud explosion. Precision and wonderfully paired ingredients that leaves your mouth just wanting more. Please do go and find out just how fantastic Odette is. I promise that you will not regret it. I'm now thinking of another excuse to go

Located at the Singapore National Gallery on the old Supreme Court side of the building, Chef Julien Royer continues with his classics like Pine Smoked Organic Egg. What really separates Odette from his old stomping grounds a JAAN is the wine paring for Royer’s Diner Tasting Menu. Odette’s sommelier takes some very interesting choices on his paring that go brilliantly well with Chef Royer’s master pieces. The restaurant is well designed providing dinners with a view of the kitchen, and comfortable seating in a environment bringing back memories of yesteryear elegance. When Chef Royer visits his patron’s tables, you can see the pride on his face from owning his own establishment. His Epicure 8 acts continues to use best seasonal ingredients from around the world, with new dishes I had not experience in the past. Service is what one would expect from Royer, well trained and understanding the need for excellence in serving such fine cuisine. Presentation and the unique usage of specially designed plates added to our culinary journey. A wonderful experience for those looking for an explosion of taste using some of the finest ingredients available in Singapore

Odette..never fails to deliver astounding dishes. We had the 8 course Chef tasting menu and each of the dishes are delectably superb.We are super excited each time the servers comes out from the see through kitchen as we waited anxiously on what comes next. A tad pricey but worth the experience and indulgence. Keep Up the good work Chef and team

What an amazing experience we had at Odette by chef Julien ROYER!First of all the location, one of the oldest building in Singapore put you right away in the mood for something exceptionnal...We had a very romantic corner of the restaurant this evening and the waiting staff makes us feel like home in a second.The chef was here to greet us too and make sure about specific diet. He also asked if we wanted to eat anything particular, i took the opportunity to ask if he had sea urchin which im fond of!The dinner starts and takes you to a culinary journey from asia to heart of france where the chef comes from: cantal!We had an amazing time there, we'll definitely be back to check on Chef's new recipes
5
second time going to odette and Chef Julien doesn't disappoint yet again! definite must try for all!
5
Bravo to Julien and Nicolas to the amazing meal we had!! Taste was pure and service was top. Something we miss in Singapore. A restaurant to watch out for as it will go a long way!!
5
Excellent food, fantastic service and a phenomenal experience with pleasurable sight and taste from each artistic presentation served in perfectly chosen crockeries. Definitely will be back again soon! :)

Amazing food, great atmosphere, outstanding restaurant. Odette is a wonderful experience. Congrats!!

This is not my kind of place.It is very effeminate in its ambience and there is no choice on the lunch menu except four or six tiny courses.The chef who has a big following is obviously pleased with his own efforts.A ludicrous description of his grandmother-the eponymous Odette- implies she inspired these overly fussy,bizarrely composed and miniscule dishes charged at a whopping price.Constant interruptions from waiting staff to give lengthy cringe-making descriptions of the dishes make conversation difficult to conduct.AThis is pretentiousness taken to absurd levels with a chef and staff who have an absurd level of self regard.Pity about the customers

The day has finally arrived when Singapore can boast there is a three Michelin star restaurant in its midst. Too early to say perhaps as the Singapore edition of the venerated food bible isn't due just yet but the experience I've just had seemed like I'd eaten in just such an establishment.Located in the newly opened National Gallery, itself a long awaited arts venue, Odette is a calm, assured restaurant in a tranquil & elegant setting. Chef Julian Royer is a talented Chef who had delighted previously eat Jaan in the nearby Swisshotel Stamford. There he had taken over from Andre Chiang who'd himself left to start his much lauded restaurant. Odette is the fulfilment of Chef Royer's food dream. Only degustation menus are available in 6 or 8 courses, with a vegetarian option. I opted for the 8 course menu and there was nary a false step. From the complimentary snacks & amuse bouche it was a class act from the start. I particularly enjoyed the Heirloom Beetroom Variation & the Barbecued Plouneour-Menez Pigeon. The food was delicate & full of flavour & you left feeling sated but not in a food induced coma. The dining room staff are young, enthusiastic & well trained. They exude a professionalism that belie their years.There was wonderful moment at the beginning when a trolley of 5 champagnes by the glass were offered, including a vintage Krug. And a lovely parting gift from the restaurant manager, Christopher Krismer of a jar of homemade black currant jam. I was completely won over.
5
Come here to spend some good time and live a culinary experience. From the start to the end they will take good care of you. The food is top. Nothing to say except that we will come back very soon. The chef came to our table to say hello. Thanks again

I took my husband for his birthday dinner at Odette just four weeks after the restaurant opened. For Singapore, which I think struggles with service, Odette was like a well-seasoned doyenne of Singapore dining.The meal is exciting from the beginning. One of the canapes of Cantal cheese (where Chef Julien is from), black truffle disc and emulsion, pickled onion and confit egg yolk, is assembled by tweezer in the palm of your hand.The food was spectacular, and we were thrilled that few of our Jaan favourites (mushroom tea, smoked egg and beetroot) appeared. Although slightly tweaked, each still managed to create that magical first mouthful of joy.Attention to detail is what I think elevates Odette. Of course the way that the food is presented so simply to showcase the ingredients, but sitting in front of the kitchen with a birds eye view we could see how complicated each dish was to even assemble. Then there are the things like the thoughtful plate ware, to the refreshing towel to clean your hand before the canape above was assembled, to the chef personally presenting us some of our courses, to the knowledgeable and cheeky staff (the Sommelier is brilliant), to the beautifully boxed red currant jam they give you to take home. They all add to the warmth and charm and sophistication of Odette.I can't recommend this restaurant highly enough. Definitely one of the best in Singapore

Our company had a celebration lunch at Odette, where a special 6 courses menu were prepared for us. Everything was brilliant, cementing my very high opinion of chef Julian Royer. Ambience, furniture, cutlery very tasteful; service was impeccable, and our host was well-measured in his interactions.There are many elements in each of the 6 dishes (+ amuse-bouche + pre-dessert), giving each course variations is taste and texture, while retaining a good balance that showcased the main element on the plate.Some highlights for me were: - chilli crab kueh-pie-ti - that butter (that's practically fat, but oh-so-nice!) - scallop on roasted pork belly - beetroot everything (so creative & pretty) - lemon sorbet encased in meringueSadly we didn't get to try chef Royer's signature egg dish... Highly recommended, must go!Go for lunch, cos it's cheaper than dinner (less courses), and not poorer in quality
5
A GREAT, GREAT CHEF. Julien Royer pulled all his genius, passion and strength to an even higher level than ever before.The tasting menu is fantastically balanced, sophisticated, original, audacious… and always with an uncompromised respect for the quality of the ingredients. Flavours are sublimated, tastes are combined with some genius creativity, presentation is a piece of art in itself, portions are perfectly balanced and rather generous, but never excessive:the beetroot "symphony" is out of this world, foie gras duo (cooked and half-cooked) and audacious fig millefeuille is to die for. The deserts seem basic on paper, but believe me, they are unique with the flavours that literally explode in the mouth: caramel salted butter ice cream, and impromptu of dark chocolate… unrivalled, as pure and delicate, without any hint of unnecessary sweetness, just the perfect balance…The wine pairing is brilliant: the staff know their job. Very original, rare and astonishing grands crusThe service is faultless: discreet, attentive, caring, engaging. And the decorum is magically elegant, sober and pleasant. The restaurant has only round tables, that are quite spaced. It is somewhat very intimate, and quiet, lighting is pleasantly indirect and just bright enough to give a very cosy atmosphere.The English manager and the Austrian Maitre d hotel are highly professional and efficient.Chef Julien Royer is very generous with his time and shares his passion, inviting guests, in turn, into his impeccable kitchen (that is visible from the dining room, through glass-doors), for a unique "trou normand.We are passionate gourmet, my husband and I, and we have quite a solid experience of many 3Michelin restaurants in France and abroad. Odette is definitely the finest in Singapore in this category

You could say that this restaurant is as sophisticated as it gets for fine dining in Singapore. Beautifully "crafted'' food which is both pleasing for the palatte as it is for the eye. Did I enjoy every dish ? No. but that's not the only point. You marvel at the presentation and the care the excellent staff takes to present each course. It's of course special too to be in the newly restored parliment building and it adds an air of opulence. My only gripe is that it was difficult to find with almost no signage from the carpark lift. Memorable ? Yes, Expensive ? Yes. But certainly special

Dined here on their first week of public opening. The staff is extremely attentive and well spoken, which puts you in a real nice mood. I think that is their best card to play. The food is real good, mouthwatering. Portions are tiny as expected, but something you have not tried before. Be mindful, it is not cheap

Wife had arrange birthday lunch this week at Odette, Iggy's, Andre, Waku Ghin, Les Amis as our annual France food and wine pilgrimage trip was cancelled due to the attacks.We are locals and I have never dine at these places because fine dining in Singapore comes with exorbitant pricing. We prefer to take our money and spent at overseas Michelin starred restaurants.We are not Jaan loyalists and I have never dine in Jaan. That's my benchmark.The lunch consists of a 4 course and 6 course tasting menu. The 6 course menu @ $150 was good value since though can be heavy for some - this was offered in the dinner menu at a higher price and also a 8 course @ $320 without drinks.The only feedback we had was the menu was difficult to read even with the bright deco, as the font use was a tad too fine for the above 40s client base. Though the chef and his team are all below 34 yrs old, the change in the menu font would help most guests read the 'finer prints'. As the previous reviewers have mentioned before that he has brought half his team and cuisine style from Jaan. Those who like Jaan food would not be disappointed. Thus, I will not cover Odette's food.Our wait staff (zac) was accommodating to change our menu as we don't like Saba fish.The wait staff need to get their act quick in such a fine dining place, as I notice 5 guests seated in front of us waited for quite a while for their menu. Mind you, they were in the restaurant earlier than us. I had to alert a staff - Ling (got to know her name later as she was the cheese expert) to attend to these guests. I am a hands on person (maitre d) and have dine throughout the world to tell where inefficiencies lies in restaurant (No one likes inattentive wait staff).Overall our lunch took 2.5 hours over a 6 course menu. This was acceptable to us for fine dining. However, during the end of the service, we had a long pause as everyone was busy taking photos with Raymond Blanc in the kitchen. We were like forgotten and had to ask our wait staff whether we were done with our meal. We knew we have not been served our petit fours and coffee.At this level of dining, chef's personality and the front staff makes the difference. The chef and wait staff can choose to make you feel at home and ensure you become their regulars or visitors. Alternatively, the chef is not oblige and has his own prerogative to visit each table or do small talk.Chef JR only came to our table once to serve the pineapple desserts and ask how was our meal but feel to introduce himself or make us feel more welcome. If he had bother to bring out the pineapple dessert, he should have bother to spend a few more seconds to make small talk. That's was the icing to a repeat customer.Overall our verdict based on a similar price point and service, I would dine at Andre again. Chef Andre walk me to the door and saw me off. Btw, Odette will get his 1 star and that I am sure

I ate at Jaan when he was running it and and it was good enough to make me want to eat at Odette's. We tried it in its first week and it is really wonderful. A series of imaginative dishes, great flavours and textures. As good a set lunch as I have had anywhere. A series of amuses bouches before the meal and delicious bread that I had too much of. They were happy to substitute several dishes, as I don't eat shellfish. One was a vegetarian salad with jerusalem artichokes that was sensational. The beetroot plate is exceptional. The wine list is perhaps a little short and does not have enough bottles under S$100. More wines by the glass or pichet would be good. The decor is interesting but the ceiling installation looked like it had been created by a primary school art class. At least it was better then the dreadful installation they have at Jaan.
5
Best dining experience so far in Singapore at this newly opened establishment helmed by a well known name in this city. Food ambiance and service combine to luxuriate the diner in a culinary experience worthy of 1, perhaps 2 *It is truly a level above most restaurants in Singapore and worth a visit
5
Odette showcases "big cinema" of gastronomy. Food is top level, service is great and ambience is new, fresh and impressive. Have been there in the opening week, level was already very high and I can't wait to go back in a few months to see how the team has evolved. Odette will definitely hit a spot in the top 15 restaurants of Asia. Congrats to JR and his team.

I was hugely looking forward to our trip to Odette as I had always loved the food at Jaan, Julien Royer's previous restaurant and I am delighted to say I was suitably impressed, not only was the food as excellent, but the staff were just as beautifully trained, not surprising when a number were at Jaan previously. It was a lovely touch that they greeted us by name and remembered what we had drunk as appetisers when at Jaan. One of the staff also noticed that I am left handed and asked gently which way I would like my cutlery laid - I have never seen that attention to detail before.The food has developed in both flavour and texture, the experimentation is still there, but this time it's more subtle and the confidence of this young chef shines through. I was always a fan of the slow cooked egg at Jaan, but this time it was presented with a more subtle pine smoking instead of the previous Rosemary - an improvement I think. For me though the most outstanding course was the flounder with Thai veloute, the combination of flavours and textures with the best piece of cooked fish I have ever eaten will certainly send me back for more.Finally the additional touches of a copy of the menu (suitably adjusted for my preferred pudding) and Grandmere Odette's jam made the evening very special.I have only two things that I think could be improved:1. The duck foie gras was the only dish on the menu that I don't think worked - the corn mousse rather overpowered the foie gras2. The lighting in the first part of the restaurant can be a little harsh which I think is due to the down lighters above the windows a change of bulb maybe all it needs to warm this area.These criticisms are very minor and should not put one off going.This was without a doubt one of the most memorable meals I have ever eaten - I can give no higher praise

As committed fans of Julien Royer's cooking at Jaan we were very excited to try his new venture at Odette. Essentially, he's taken everything that was great about Jaan (including some of the excellent front of house team) and has moved it on to the next stage.The setting in the newly refurbished National gallery is delightfully calm and elegant - no views this time, but who cares!We chose the eight course Epicure tasting menu and it was fabulous. From the little savouries and the amuse bouche right through to the cheese and the puddings, every course was an absolute delight. Each dish was beautifully presented and showed some lovely inventive touches, but at no time did I feel that presentation had taken precedence over taste. All the ingredients were very fresh and perfectly cooked, and the balance of flavours was a delight. It's hard to pick out any one dish because they were all so good, but the pine smoked organic egg takes one of chef Royer's signature dishes to a whole new level, and what they can do with a simple plate of beetroot has to be tasted to be believed. I would also recommend the wine paring. They had chosen some very interesting wines, one or two of which were unexpected, but I felt each one complemented the food very well.The service was also first rate. Not only was it efficient, the waiting staff were also very engaged and were clearly enjoying what they were doing as well as ensuring that we should enjoy our meal. It was also lovely to be greeted and looked after by some familiar faces.It is undoubtedly expensive, but I thought it was well worth it for the quality of the meal we had. It's too new to have been ranked but based on our meal I would put it firmly in the Michelin multi-star category.Overall I thought it was an outstanding meal and a highly enjoyable evening. I can't wait to go back
5
I have been to Odette for lunch with my good friends! The restaurant ambience is stunning! Unbelievable how great a restaurant can look like! The food made us speechless - every single bite was a festival on the palate! The service is really attentive! Thanks to Christoph for great wines being served! Also Austrian wines - we loved that!

A beautiful setting that is modern, classy and refine. Coming to Odette is an unique experience as I drove pass several monuments such as the Fullerton Hotel, crossing Anderson bridge, Victoria concert hall, the Padang and the National Gallery comprising the former Supreme Court and City Hall. Having read a recent review of Odette in The Business Times, I have to say that Julien should not change his approach to his product driven cuisine. His formula at Jaan has proven to work very well with his strict focus on honest cuisine, a taste for high quality ingredients and his art of doing things both simply and skilfully. At Odette, Julien's guests will feel very much at home with familiarity while his menu slowly evolves with new inventive dishes. Why should one come to dine with at Odette? For the simple love of honest cooking with excellent produces. My family and I enjoy every single blissful moment in Maison Royer. Have a look at the champagne trolley and the wine list, there are some very interesting producers and vintages to choose from
