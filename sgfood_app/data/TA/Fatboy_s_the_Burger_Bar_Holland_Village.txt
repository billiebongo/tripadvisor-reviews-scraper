Probably one of the best burger place in Singapore. The burgers are fat and very tasty. The side dishes are also nice.
Plus the street atmosphere is worth the visit.

Amazing range of burgers, to option of making your own burger. satisfied with my YOLO burger. Price reasonable before service charges and tax.

This place is still great. Good service great food and drink. Not cheap though. A first class burger with fries and a bottle of imported IPA was around $33.
My build your own burger was excellent as was the service.

somehow, however you customise your burger, at fatboy's it'll always be really yummy. i love mine with grilled pineapple and peanut butter.
keep a look out for their beer promotion too, always a great idea to merge friends, burgers and beer.

First things first, I highly recommend this place for burgers and beers. Be prepared for a messy meal but it's totally worth it. Great selection (I went for the fat basterd which was humongous, next time I will go for the wimpy) is complemented by a decent selection of beers and the basic starters you would expect in a burger joint. Slightly expensive but you def pay for the quality you get

Great burgers - choose from a handful of named burgers or build your own.We enjoyed sitting outside watching the world go by.Situated in the middle of Holland Village where the road gets blocked from cars from 6pm and all the restaurants immediately extend their table areas onto the road.Food was great, staff were good but they did seem to be short staffed so there was a wait for most things but I am told that this was really abnormal and the service usually much better

I had the Burgatory which was very good. Really liked the spiciness of it. My friend built his own burger which can get expensive if you add a whole bunch of stuff. Sides - we ordered jalapeno poppers (good), cheese sticks (hard to go wrong) and onion rings - I found the batter a bit too much and thought they could be crisper. To each his own. Big menu selection. Choice of high or low tables, sit inside or outside. Service was good. Was a long wait for food. Place was packed. Parking could be tricky

I went there one evening with my teenage kids. It was quite late so we decided to go there and also, we have not been there. The first impression was that it was looking like a fun burger joint with the decor and music. It offers burgers, fries, hotdogs, beer, milkshakes and floats. The servings were huge as we looked at what diners were eating. There was a mixture of people there - kids, young couples, friends and including a couple who were "I work out at the gym!" type. The menu was interesting and you will probably take some time to decide what you want. The menu was very detailed and you could also build up your own burger. As usual, floats and milkshakes there go well with your burger. Careful as you can't have this kind of food often but it was great if you are hungry and want some 'junk' food for a change! But on a $23.00/person average, it is fulfilling

This place is always packed and popular among the drinking crowd during weekends, but the quality of their burgers is average if not sub-standard (although they are pretty big if the size is what you are after). There are plenty of better places to eat around Holland Village, and certainly better places to fix my burger cravings in Singapore, so I won't be coming back
