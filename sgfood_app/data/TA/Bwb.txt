Had a burger with 2 types of fries, all of which was tasty. But what made it a great dining experience was the high calibre of the staff, in particular a male waiter who was most gracious in his service, even tho we dined quite late in the evening. Am sorry I didn't get his name

BWB is famous for its wings but nobody should leave this place without trying out its famous burgers. The wings are quite tasty and well seadoned. However after several visits we thought of trying their only 4 burgers. The burgers have a local twist in it and is quite perfect in size and taste. The peanut butter burger was simply something you will not find in other places. Besides the burgers the fries menue is quite extraordinary. Having varius types of fries including yam, potato and sweetest potato fries all of them were quite satisfying. They have a wide range of beers and wines which are perfect to go with the food. At friday nights you might expect a huge crowd which the waiters are simply working hard but it has to be improved by the management. Most of the waiters are very friendly and similing all the time, but apprently friday nights need more people to serve the crowd.

We were warmly greeted when we arrived at level 11 and were attended to promptly when it was time to take our orders. Upon ordering, we were asked whether the burger can be cut in half for us to share. It was as though the customer's needs were anticipated beforehand by the staff.The drinks and food came promptly. Taste of the food was good and the staff was very friendly. Ambience was also great and we enjoyed ourselves thoroughly. Thumbs up to bwb! On a side note, there are lunch set menus which are very affordable! Will try out the lunch sets next time

It was almost 2pm and we dropped by the restaurant with 3 very hungry kids. We were greeted by a pleasant staff who brought us to a table inside.There were 2 on-going offers and we decided to give them a try.We ordered 2 daily lunch set (buttermilk chicken and handpressed burger). We loved both burgers but the handpressed beef burger was very good. the patty was juicy, nicely cooked till medium, sandwiched between a set of nicely toasted buns. the buns were fluffy and just right for the burger. The staff were most considerate to cut the burger into quarters as we were sharing the dishes.The Hickory BBQ chicken wings was the next stand out dish. It was nicely glazed with the sauce but personally, I am happy that the sauce is not overwhelming. The wings remained juicy - meat peeling off the bones easily. The BBQ flavour was evident, the wings were not burnt and overall, a dish greatly appreciated by my wife and I.the kids preferred to have the "naked chicken wings" that are served without any sauces. The fries which were served with the burger are good, with a light crisp.Overall, the staff was attentive and helpful, always serving with a smile. Personally, I like the "boxing posters" that surround the restaurant, giving a very sporty flavour to the whole ambience. Overall, a very good dining experience. For wings and burger lovers, I personally recommend to check out this place

Staff were really great, attentive and helpful. Just disappointed with the fries, they really taste they were freezer burnt. AND they do not serve RANCH with their Chicken wings!Its like, your in Asia and you have a meal with no rice or noodles! TIP:Sit inside, especially when it is hot cause the fans do not work outside

Friendly staff that make you feel comfortable and settled in quickly. Loved the innovative burgers and the wings on offer. The burgers are well constructed, whether beef or chicken. Loved the coffee marmalade and cajun wings. And yes, my family and I had a selection of fries - sweet potato, cheese, garlic fries

Hidden away above the streets of Orchard lies this bar with all day happy hours. Found on the Entertainer app too! Quick friendly service, tasty burgers, we had the Heavy Weight (Medium for us) Burger. Music playing, comfy chairs and on good days a great view. We will come again (that's what she said).

My husband and I hadn't booked a table. But we're able to get one no problem when we turned up.My husband and I ordered a water, lager, pizza, chips and a burger.The large portion of chips arrived before our drinks.Then my husbands burger arrived which was the whopper. I've attached a picture. It looks big but it wasn't. The other strange thing is it doesn't come with French fries.After my husband finished his burger then my pizza arrived. It would of been nice for all the food to arrive at the same time.I'm afraid we won't be back
