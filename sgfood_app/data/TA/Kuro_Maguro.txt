Small portions. Expensive. Crowded. Rubbing elbows and tripping on the way out.
Ordered fried fish. Overcooked and tasteless. The toro was not bad, but not great.
Very rude staff. Practically threw the food on my table. Surprising for a Japanese restaurant.

They only serves a fixed menu during lunch.
Food is average, prices are affordable.
Tables are too close to each other.
Service is poor.

We had a satisfying lunch at this little restaurant that serves a variety of good quality sashimi bowls. The aburi versions are flame seared at your table just before serving. We ordered the salmon and maguro aburi bowl and the maguro and Uni bowl- both were tasty and the portions just right. The prices are similar to other casual dining Japanese places in Singapore - S$19 to S$45 but that's directly reflected in the quality (which can't be said for every place). Definitely recommended if you are in the area.

Tanjong Pagar Centre has many cafes but I would highly recommend this. The sashimi was fresh and value for money. Service was prompt and cheerful. I wanted to try the swordfish sashimi was told that it is sold out as they have 3 per day !

Ocean that melts in the mouth. Each piece served in my don whether uni ikura or toro is top notch fresh with beautiful marbling sitting on warm marinated Jap rice. They procure fresh tuna directly from Japan and uses a technique to freeze them at 60 degree celcius. The store is slightly hard to find but turn into the office building and it is by the side together with other eateries. Service here is excellent, arrived late afternoon not too far from closing hours but they permitted me a quick meal and my don arrived promptly. Can't wait to be back

Went recommended by local friends, really enjoyed the experience. The quality of the fish is excellent and feels fresh and unique. We were lucky to make it on time a Sunday evening before they closed. It is a bit difficult to find as it is not on street level view but worth trying very much! Thumbs up, will be back for sure

Went here with friends twice in 3 days. Quality of fish here is very good for the price you're paying, confirmed by the friend that owns a Tuna import business. Their dons are very good value. Service was ok although slow at times when very busy but good for South East Asia standard. Call ahead to book if you want to avoid queuing at peak times

I would have given 5/5 if not for the starters. The dons are excellent.Went for dinner and was greeted with Spring Seasonal Menu. We decide to order a veg (cold dish from Seasonal Menu), tofu salad, a recommended Maguro (3 types) Don and a Chu-toro with Uni and Ikura. Here's my review:1. Vegetable turned out to be type of Cai-Xin. Not too tasty and I find it a bit too cold. (Forgettable)2. Tofu Salad comes with a wasabi soy sauce (separate). It's quite tasty but beware, do not pour the source into the salad as it is quite salty. The tofu is quite alright but I had better at Suju (Mandarin Hotel). The Salad came in the midst of our main don, that didn't really help. (Forgettable)3. 3-types Maguro. Real good maguro and each slice is so fresh/tender and without the grains that normally get stuck in between the teeth. Each slice goes well with the fresh wasabi! The rice is good vinaigrette rice with sesame and a bit of sea weed. Overall, EXCELLENT.4. Maguro with Uni and Ikura. The Uni has a bit of smell but the Ikura and Chu-toro is EXCELLENT. All don comes with a clear miso soup. Overall, this is the place for me for Maguro don

It located in a new-still-construction building in Tanjor Pagar that most taxi driver unknown about it; if you go by taxi, drop at Wallick Residence Lobby. The restaurant isn't that big but you can feel the Japanese's ambience. It specialities indeed in tuna; from sashimi to grill (no sushi in this branch), from fatty tuna to head meat. Sashimi is fresh! The sashimi & cooked dish portion are bigger cuts than other restaurants with cheaper price; ootoro is good bargain! The don also come in mini but it really small, only few slices of fish. And the sushi rice just enough acidity & sweetness. They seem to have a set lunch too. Reservation may need in weekend
