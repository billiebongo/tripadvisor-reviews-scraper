I had dinner at Chuan Yang Ji myself since my friend recommended it to me. I tried the mutton noodle with very good handmade noodle. The cold dish was also very nice. It is no doubt the best mutton restaurant in Singapore!

There's only two of us and we ordered a set dinner for 2-3 persons. I would recommend to order the set only when there's 3 guests as the servings are more for 3 than 2 persons. The mutton soup is very flavorsome and the ribs and meat slices superbly tender. The set came with dessert. Overall, it's value for money for a good meal

Visited this provincial Chinese restaurant for lunch. It offered steamy bowls of Chinese-style mutton soup with rice or noodles for less than $6. We ordered a non-spicy and spicy version with an additional mixed meat with special chili sauce at $8. The flavors of the broth were rich with herbs and mutton. The meat and parts were tender, and the rice noodles were slurpy. The side order of mix meats were coated in a rich, red and fragrant chili oil. It turned out to be a delicious lunch. Service was also friendly and courteous. We'll be back for the mutton steamboat

I came recommended by friends who do not eat mutton but relish drinking the flavorful herbal mutton soup.we ordered the set for 2, added fresh beef slices and plates of vegetables.Had the cold dish (seaweed and beancurd strings) and kou shui steamed chicken. The chilli was great. we paid $100 for 4 pax including beer, which is pretty reasonable.Great for sharing with friend
