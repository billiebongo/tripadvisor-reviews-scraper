Good Thai food with flavours bringing us back to Thailand. 2 persons approx 30$ for a very tasty lunch on a simple street cafe. Nothing fancy, but a good alternative.

Other than the cheap prices, the taste of the food is mediocre and the waiting time is rather long as well. If you are a student, there is a student menu for you and the food will be even cheaper.

Awesome Thai food. This place is runned by Thais and the tom yum doesn't get better than this. They also do take aways and you could call in advance to order. My favorite budget Thai place at the moment.

This is a no frills basic street side cafe, table and chairs outside on Bukit Timah road. The food is excellent, very good and tasty Thai food. The menu has all the usual dishes you would expect; Tom yum, som tam, yam nuer, pad Thai, curries, other salads, etc etc. It's all fabulous, just the perfect spot for a quick, cheap but delicious lunch.It's cash only, no credit cards

It was my first time at Le Wu Caf√© and I learnt that this restaurant is opened by Thais! I'm a big fan of spicy food, and the chefs are able to strike a balance between spiciness and maintaining the foundation of the dish, thus resulting in a combination of great flavours in your mouth! Fried chicken, tamarind prawns and Kang Kong with Thai chillies are recommended! They are generous with the seafood in their seafood tom yum soup. However, I am a much bigger fan of the clear tom yum soup, which is, in my opinion, spicier and more sour as compared to the milky one.

Been there a few times with friends. I love their Tom yum soup with noodles, chicken curry, fried noodles/rice and mackerel otah. Do not expect amazing service.. You have to order at the counter and help yourself to water, utensils and cutleries. But I like the laidback ambiance. They served a mean Thai ice coffee. Expect good hearty and wholesome Thai food in a open air simple setting. Do not go there is you are in a hurry... Expect to wait during peak lunch hours. Worth going back again if Thai food is your thing. Price wise it is very reasonable.

Great neighborhood restaurant. No frills just good food and drinks at very reasonable prices. Basil chicken is fantastic as is the soup and the pork shoulder. Great place to relax on a weeknight when you can't be bothered cooking, or for a refreshing beer after a walk through the nearby botanic gardens.

I've eaten here numerous occasions and must say that they are fairly consistent throughout and very good food and to our taste. The Thai coffee is nice and you can ask for cup of syrup adjusting sweetness for it. I like the olive rice and love the spicy chili with fish sauce. The pad Thai is good too. The usual favs are all done just right with all the lemon grass and spices to spruce things up. Have a cool glass of water in hand in case the spice tong yam irritate yours. It happens when I don't drink enough to water prior to eating their food. I like the fish cake too with the sweet peanut sauce. You can't go too wrong there.

I've been frequenting this place for more than a year since moving to Singapore from BKK and previously Australia and decided it's time to write a review. If you're looking for everyday, authentic food at a very reasonable orice, you have to stop here. Don't expect fancy decor or scenery (one overlooks Bukit Timah road but is set back from the traffic and fumes!) but do expect good fresh cuisine (Chinese and Thai) ,good portions and authentic ingredients. Singha beer is cheap by Singapore standards (5SGD) and students get special discounts on the menu. I've never eaten from the Chinese menu which I'm sure is excellent but the Thai cuisine is so good that I asked if a Thai chef was present in the kitchen. I was told that yes, the owner is Thai! Ok! I rest my case....A hole in the wall here for the past 20 years, this delightful cafe that you won't miss from the road thanks to the large blue awning, is a must! Seriously, order anything. I dare you - it's all good and supported by the large daily crowds. Simple, chill-out environment with multicultural diners at all times of the day , humble furnishing, close to bus transport and within walking distance from MRT and Bukit Timah gate of the Botanic Gardens, am I missing something? This is THE place for authentic Thai food
