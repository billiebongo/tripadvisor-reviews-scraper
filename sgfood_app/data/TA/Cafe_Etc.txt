Made a reservation through the Eatigo app. Good was good, decent quality. We tried burger, steak and bolognese pasta. Service is excellent. Ordered tower of beer and relaxed the whole evening.

We visited this restaurant and liked the Wagyu beef burger as it didn't taste too rich or fatty. It was well prepared. The Olio Aglio pasta was ok only. I'll come back for more burger.

Been here many times...usually I'll start with a Asahi beer (happy hour $10) followed by a wagyu beef burger. The peculiar thing about the burger was that the buns were black. Charcoal or squid ink buns? Not mentioned in the menu. There's caramelized onions, tomato, beef patty and pepper sauce in the burger. It's not the blackish type of pepper sauce we were used to in those western stalls. Instead it was brownish and had only a slight hint of pepper and spiciness. The beef patty was compact and you cannot taste the ground beef like some other burger joints. But I liked it this way. I had also tried the foie gras with toasts and the prawn aglio olio. I liked the foie gras but I don't like the way they did the aglio olio. Sauce was too heavy and intense. I felt it should be lighter. I've tried the dessert too- the molten lava chocolate cake that's quite common in many cafes. It was just as nice here. I remembered they have an offer of dessert with beer, but that was last time and they may have removed it. Service was very friendly and you have a choice of outdoor or indoor seating. Seen many families coming in with booking and there might be some special offers with a website. Check other reviewers - someone did mention.

I am happy to have visited this place with my girlfriend! When we arrived, we were the only ones there, so it was nice and peaceful for us to have a chat. The food was awesome and presented nicely too! The buffalo wings are good to try :

Cafe Etc is a casual diner that offers a variety of western cuisine ranging from soups, salads to grilled steaks and pasta. For our first visit , we had the meatball pasta and Oglio Olio mushroom. Both entrees were surprisingly good , al dented and tasted perfect. They've both outside and inside seating , the place is popular with Thomson residents. Try it , nice food at reasonable prices
