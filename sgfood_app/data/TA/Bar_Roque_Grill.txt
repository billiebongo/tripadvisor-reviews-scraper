this is a very nice place, nice waiter who willing to explain in detail of their foods.
the environment is good. just that some fruit flies around. or else it will wonderful
5
A steak restaurant with a very nice ambiance and wide selection of steak cuts. Steaks were well-made and well salted with serving of bearnaise sauce. Desserts were also good!
4
food was awesome and cooked to perfection. Only lack vegetable dishes and also too pricey for something like stir fry mushroom n spinach. Would be great to serve butter and garlic forest mushrooms or something
4
Went here to grab a quick protein fix and ordered a half chicken. It was really good and moist, served with some greens and carbs. Good value and definitely will return.
5
Always great! Chef Stefan and his team at Bar-roque...one of Singapore’s greats! For a special treat try to visit when Chef Stefan’s mum is in town. Desserts to die for!
5
Just awesome, located conveniently outside 100AM, with a nice separate bar. The dining area is cosy, with the lower level being a bit quieter. If you are in a big group it might be best to ask to be near the chefs as it's an open kitchen on the upper seating area.Booked for a 6pm seating and turned up 10 minutes early, but was greeted by name with no need to ask. Served through out the meal by really attentive staff Hoe Yin being our main waiter.Went with Hoe Yin and the other waitresses recommendations:Charcuterie platterMussels (300g)Tenderloin - MainChocolate Mouse & Creme Brulee - DesertLatte - DrinkTotal = $233 SGD for both of usOverall a great experience, certainly priced at the higher end, but well worth it in our opinion. The food is delicious with a wide range of dishes. If you have a more flexible budget then do experience this awesome restaurant
5
Tried their dry aged beef ribeye on bone along with tomato soup, foie gras with sides of broccoli and ravioli. Beef was served with a touch of black truffle with lettuce. It was very tender and cooked brilliantly. The tomato soup was exceptional as was the ravioli. Definitely this place is a must try
5
The food here is just amazing. We were here eating three courses for hours and drinking, made a whole night out of it here. The staff are very friendly and professional. Would recommend to everyone and definitely go back when next in Singapore. Anyone reading this has to visit the food is just to die for. We went back the next day we were so impressed
5
This is the best place I have visited in Singapore. I can not recommend it highly enough. Food is perfect, selection of wine is amazing and the atmosphere is fantastic :) the chef and owner are both lovely and the customer service is perfect. I will certainly go back as often as I possibly can. I had the tarte flambÃ© with snails, Beef Wellington, and tarte tatin... 10/10 perfection. Very happy customer :
4
A pleasant ambiance in this restaurant definitely helps you to feel better after a long and busy day. Nice selection of dishes with of course, a clear domination from the French specialities. A very tempting wines list in which you will find some good French wines at a reasonable pricing. We had the languedoc bar-roque and were not disappointed.Very good service from thee young lady who took care of our table; she was professional, courteous and always keen to help with a nice smile.The music was a bit too loud, they do not need to do so to make a difference, on the contrary!Not cheap, but a good experience indeed that gave us the feeling we have to go back and sample a few other specialities
4
I really love the dover sole fish and the chicken. A must try..! However, i think the lack of the atmosphere, makes the experience less exciting
5
I brought my GF and my father here, ordered the 3 courses menu. The seasoning of every dish is outstanding, my favorite one was absolutely the starter tomato soup. The atmosphere was also nothing to complain, gorgeous place for a weekend feast.
4
It is a bit of a sacrilege to eat steak in Singapore, what with so much else to chose from, but Bar-Roque is a solid choice to sate a craving!
Had a well prepared hanger steak with béarnaise sauce and chips. Pleasant outside seating area.
5
Had a beautiful meal (loved the crab meat pasta).
Had a great recommendation of wines and a blast with all the friendly and talented staffs.
Highly recommended with friends for drinks and casual bites as well as a romantic full meal with your love ones.
5
Great meal, amazing atmosphere, very good wines especially their burgundy red from Chanzy. All dishes I tasted were fantastic, chef Stephane Istel is definitely very talented.
4
All in all a good experience at Bar-Roque Grill except that we had to spend a lot of the time chasing away flies that insisted on landing in my beer and on the food.
5
Absolutely delicious food in an excellent location right at the heart of the city. Quality ingredients, tasty dishes made with love :)
5
3rd time at Bar Roque to enjoy the Beef Wellington! I loved it so much the first time that I came back twice to enjoy it again, im pretty sure the rest of the menu is at the same level of quality but I really fell for this one. Excellent staff service and warm welcome.
4
Open kitchen steak restaurant. European kitchen with specialty on steaks in all sizes. Informal ambiance. Good for business dinners as it is not loud and noisy as some places are. As everywhere in Singapore ... wines are overpriced (because of high import taxes) and therefor can jack up the bill massively if you keep ordering
5
New in Singapore, i found an excellent restaurant that offers traditional food made by a truly passionate chef who knows how to host and bring his passion onto your plate. Staff is really friendly , the manager very professional and the outdoor layout brings conviviality. Good vibes and fun.
5
had a date with my fiancee and am glad that i chose this beautiful restaurant with excellent service. Food was worthwhile for the price and service was excellent with great ambiance.
4
The meats served were really very well seasoned and prepared. Had the chicken and the ribeye and they were both skilfully done - flavourful and tender!
3
It is a well decorated restaurant with good food. However waitress did not offer give the option of tap water and charge us for the still water she put out there.
5
Great food, well prepared and well presented. A welcome atmosphere and a magical choice of dishes. Dione and enjoy!
4
Had a good time in this restaurant. It's outdoor which become quite rare in Singapore. The staff is professional and attentive, we got a table without reservation on a Saturday night. And honestly the food is very good :) Recommended meals: spinach salad, confit duck and mini raviolis + the amazing almond ice-cream so yummy :)
4
Have been to this restaurant on several occasions now and generally food is of a high standard, this time it was for our 10th anniversary. My favourite dish is the smaller meat platter which is great...You have a choice to eat inside or out.. Unfortunately again its another venue that does not offer Happy Hour on spirits (only wines)... which is a shame. My only moan about the place is the cost of water SN$7.00 (which i didn't realise we were being charged for at the time as it came is an in-house bottle, could have come straight from the tap and you would not have know otherwise)....I will quite happily eat there again.
5
We've eaten here a few times and the service has always stood out to me. The food is definitely good, more hits than misses. On this occasion, they gave me an overcooked strip-loin but the service recovery was more than amazing. The manager immediately changed it and insisted (even though we said no need) to top up our wine glasses and when the bill came, they did not charge us for the steak, which I certainly did not expect to be comped. Certainly will remember and return.
3
I rarely give bad feedback, but I think there's something that needs to be fixed here.My wife and I were there for my wife's birthday dinner, and we were thankful that there was still an available table even though we arrived late. We were served a marvelous tomahawk steak, which was what Bar-Roque Grill was known for. However, we were seated at a narrow table that could barely hold our main meal. We were served the wrong appetizers, and the sparkling water was warm and flat. Service was inattentive and somewhat impatient. We were also seated beside a table of obnoxious, drunk guests who sexually harassed the staff and threatened other guests. Not the restaurant's fault, but I wish something could have been done by the managers. I left quickly after my meal, as I didn't want to make a fuss on my wife's birthday. I hope the restaurant learns to do better. Perhaps next time
5
Been here twice but my first review. Went in group both times, left impressed both times. From food to service, love them all. Ordered a tomahawk with no price on the menu, and was shown the meat before accepting it, a wholesome 900gm beautiful cut. It took awhile to sear but the end result was just amazing, impeccable from the look and flavor. Waiters and waitresses were professional and knowledgeable, wine selection was plentiful and table service was attentive. A place you want to bring you carnivore guests
5
The food was absolutely amazing -- cheesy "pizza" appetizer (with bacon and truffle!), fresh oysters, tuna carpaccio, clams in white sauce, foie gras plate and melt-in-your mouth steak were all to die for! As if that's not enough, the service was absolutely topnotch. So rare to experience a delicious fine dining experience that will not burn a hole in your wallet and Bar-Roque is a gem. Michelin Bib Gourmand well deserved
2
Average food, not-so-fresh ingredients, terribly slow and rude service. Practically threw plates on the table. A set lunch course took more than 2 hours - what's the point?
4
Good food (especially the tomahawk steak) and wines, excellent service, good ambience. This place will not disappoint!
5
When we first stepped in to the restaurant, the chef greeted us warmly, and so did the wait staff. This set the tone for an enjoyable meal at Bar-Roque. The food was hearty and delicious, and the service was excellent.
4
good service, good food and good ambience, overall good experience
definitely visiting next time for the great experience
5
One of my favorite places in Singapore. Everything from the food & wine to the service is top of the notch quality. Really pleasant time with the GM and Chef who took the time to talk with us.
2
I was under the impression that they specialized in meats, so we ordered the beef wellington and ribeye. Both were too salty and we were very disappointed. Customer service was OK - everyone was polite and service wasn't slow.
4
A bit misleading is that outside of the restaurant there is a big sign saying happy hour until 7 or 8 but when you get the bill they tell you the happy hour is not for the restaurant, only for the bar outside. Not so nice. The food however was very good. We had smoked salmon and octopus (grilled) salad as a starter and we both wished we had this for a main. Both were fantastic, I specifically liked the grilled octopus, simply delicious, maybe the best I've had in Singapore so far. Our mains were roasted snapper (very good) and hanger steak (slightly disappointing as it went cold after the second piece). Such a shame for that last part but the taste was great. The staff was very friendly, especially Kamal, except for one older Asian lady who was close to rude. I asked for mayonnaise to go with the french fries and when I asked her she looked at me as if to say what the hell do you want that for? Anyway, as we already guessed, the mayonnaise never came. So a clear case of someone who is supposed to wait you but couldn't care less and doesn't even bother to bring you what you ordered. They need to look into this as she was walking around with a not so happy face the entire time. Anyway, that did not spoil our evening as the food was fantastic so we'll go there again for sure!
5
1st night in Singapore on a business trip. Arrived late and was looking for somewhere close to the hotel to eat. Arrived at Bar-roque Grill having not read any reviews - what a lucky find. Fantastic place! Love the open kitchen and the head chef was fantastic. He took the time to talk and explain the menu and is clearly pasionate about the food.I had the rib-eye steak as main, which was cooked to perfection and so tender you could have eaten it with a spoon!I will definitely return
5
Great food, good selection for business meal, fresh quality and good service. The restaurant is a good place where everyone could sit down cozily for a business meal or personal lunch or dinner with friends and family. I had snapper in lobster brisque and my customer had Baker's potluck which has pork, beef and lamb stew. Portion was just right, well cooked and we were satisfied
1
If your idea of a Friday night out with friends is a bar on a pavement, staffed by lazy people who don't know how to do their job, this is the place for you!1. Inattentive service that can leave you waiting 20 minutes for your drinks.2. When you order a pint of beer, it comes with at least 3cm of foam.3. When you ask for your pint to be topped up, you are met with either derision or bad attitude and Malay cursing.4. When you ask for your bill, please expect a 20 minute wait, even though the bar has a maximum of 50 people present.This bar deserves to be treated with the disrespect it dishes out to its customers.When there are so many other bars close to it, it deserves to die.If I could give zero stars, I would. A woeful, shocking indictment of an entertainment establishment. The management should close, go away and think about what it takes to run a real business. They clearly have no idea of what that means yet.Awful
5
I was there for an extended business lunch, staff very attentive, their starter platters and breads were amazing - best beef rib ever, they also do Tomahawks which are great for sharing.
4
Food was a tad too creamy for our taste. The portions were big and we barely finished our meals.
Great Creme Brûlée. Divine fries.
5
Was visiting singapore for the weekend after stressful few weeks. Bar-roque grill pampered me with excellent food, tasty wine and wonderful service. Best beef Wellington I've had.
5
Bar-Roque Grill is not only a fantastic food experience ! It's a also a top notch service and unique atmosphere ! Chef Stephane Istel and the staff make you feel home and each time you go, you just look forward to go back again !
5
Been there many times... quality is still at the top and the welcome so friendly. Rustic dishes home cooked with twist of fine dining. Super products, very good chef who loves what he does... just enjoy !
5
Went with friends on the eve of a public holiday having not been for a couple of years. Everything was excellent: food, service, atmosphere. Love the open kitchen, and the wait staff was professional and attentive and informative. But best is the FOOD. All orders were fantastic, especially the tri-meat platter which we shared and which came with a delicious serving of foi gras atop one of the beef selections. Brussels with bacon, homemade ravioli . They have a generous corkage policy: if you buy a bottle from them you can bring another with no corkage fee. Highly recommended
5
A french resturant which serves good Thamohak steak. Generally beef is serve well here. The starters are great too. Not fan of their desert. The food quality is high and the price is high as well. Typicall cost 100 SGD per person but is money well spend.
5
Exquisite dishes for lunch and dinner. Excellent service. As we have gluten restrictions they could offer special options for us. And food was not plain, it was really delicious. Nice atmosphere - between local and expats community. The lunch price for 2 was $150 but it was worth it
3
From good to woefully disappointing. The bread arrived after the mealThe drinks took 15 minutes to arriveFood mediocre, disappointing and insufficient Waitress - missing listManagers smoking and drinking at the barSmoking permitted even though under coverStill hungry after eating - but given up that someone will swing by and check on meHey ho..... 6,000 other places to eat in singapore.
5
Food, ambiance, as in cuisine/Chef (Stephane Istel) and service & company is unique, never failed to be the best of anything one can order.The Beef tartare, the tartes flambÃ©es, the charcuterie platter....outstanding!Cannot go wrong for romantic, business or friendly dinner.One of the best foody place in SE Asia
4
Hidden gem in Tanjong Pagar. All props to the Chef however restaurant should hire more waiting staff to improve service.
4
We tried two a la carte, namely, the steak tartare beef dish was absolutely delicious.
A bunch of attentive and pleasant folks too, you must meet with the chief and owner, it will make your experience unique...
5
Fantastic service from the crew and Chef Stephan as usual. Always very accommodating to our requests.
5
Excellent 'small eats' on our visit , particularly when combined with the 'happy hour ' offers on some beers and wine . Pavement out-door location is great for people watching in this business / local area .
4
Choose the Bar-Roque grill for my husbands birthday dinner. Overall it was a pleasant experience and the food and cocktails were superb. For the birthday desert surprise we got a large Creme brûlée which was so good that we finished the whole bowl. But I also have to make some comments on things that could be improved. First they ran out on Foie Gras pate ,I had the onion soup instead which were lovely but still I was hoping for a nice Foie Gras . Then we both had the organic rib eye steak. My husband ordered it medium to rare and I medium. This is always the real test how good a restaurant it. Unfortunately both came in medium rare and i had to give mine back and had to wait ... something I wasn't too happy about. But at the end all the food were delicious and we left happily. We will be back
5
I love coming here. The passionate Chef Stefan delivers time and time again on the dinner, lunch and specials. Always pushing the boat out from producing his own wines to creating new dishes every week to supplement the amazing roasts and fish he serves daily you can always rely on Stefan and his team to deliver time and time again.Service and food are top notch and match Stefan's passion and delivery. I can always rely on Bar Roque to deliver great food, great service and a great experience time and time again. Wonderful place, one of the best restaurants in Singapore
5
I’m still wondering why I’ve waited so long before trying this restaurant ! It’s a real gem for French nice food and pleasant service.We had a very nice dinner yesterday in Bar-Roque, seating outdoor in a cosy area.The staff is kind and attentive, friendly and efficient.We tried different dishes, from a la carte menu and the meat trolley and finally decided to order the classic tarte flambee (flammenkuesche) and the pork rillettes (by the way the bread is delicious, champagne bread like in France, with butter). The tarte is very good.Then my husband and friend shared a T-Bone beef steak with gratin dauphinois, spinash&mushrooms and lettuce. I chose the roasted chicken with salad and French fries. Waouh !! incredible. The meat was so tender and tasty, not that kind of meat tasteless and watery. Finally I managed to find a place where I can have my roasted chicken, even the skin was roasted, with a delicious chicken jus. I still have the flavor in my mouth. Hum !!!!The wine was also good. Unfortunately we had no more room for a dessert, but will try next time… soon I’m sure
5
We had a truly wonderful time at Bar roque , the food was amazing , the octopus and the beef wellington are worth trying , just delicious ! The chef Stephane and manager Nicolas made this experience unique and unforgettable ! I recommand this place for the food and atmosphere !!
3
Happy Hour is 5 - 8PM (Monday - Saturday); 50% off beers, wines, Prosecco. Had the white & red: Voignier-Muscat-Colombard 2015 & GSM 2014, Bar-Roque 6469 (Languedoc-France). They were both lovely.Bar-Roque Grill does not serve tap water here due to "hygiene issues", claiming to only have still or sparkling bottled water which is chargeable. But upon rejecting the bottled water, the waiter walked away & back, then said they could serve tap water "if we are okay with it"
5
Restaurant interiors in the style of the XVII century was opened a year ago in the business district of Tanjong Pagar. Skate - French cuisine. Book rustic terrine of duck, tender rabbit pate, and for dessert - banana tart with ice cream of salted caramel. Bonus - a wide selection of wines from around the world
3
Steak was over grilled and overpowered in taste. Could barely taste the meat after. Service was pleasant, staff were very aware of surrounding and on high alert to fill your drink or clear your plate.
5
Went back to Bar Roque recently. Chef Stephane is a genius on the grill. Must try the tarte flambé classic and the tomahawk steak. Just awesome. He continues to match or beat his already high standards. Keep it up Bar Roque!
4
A bit pricey but the chef is nice and food is good! Couscous was really good and my gf took the tartare, food as well but would have been better with home made French fries. Possibility to have tomahawk steak looking really good
4
Chef did a customised menu for our Christmas celebration, so really have no names to the dishes that we gobbled down - the entrees were awesome - loved the crispy thin pizza, the salad and of course the freshly baked loaf. The only disappointing bit was the turkey slices were a tad dry and the gravy was quite runny. The service offered to us was brilliant and wait staff were truly attentive
4
Came here with my colleagues for our Xmas lunch. We were quite pleased with the food standard and I must say the set of $38 for starter, soup and dessert is very reasonable priced. We ordered the mushroom and french onion soup which were nice. For main, I had their signature yellow chicken while my colleagues had the salmon. All the mains were delicious and portion is generous. Service was good too
5
Okay, I didn't really have dinner here. Just met up with a friend on transit (both times - same person, same place). On my second visit, I was so impressed by the recognization of the bartenders. I am sure they do get a lot of patrons passing through. But they also remember what I like to drink - apple cider, and how I like it - straight up from the bottle, no ice cubes in glass needed. That's really something for service! Kudos guys!Ordered the bar snacks, which were excellent!! Do try the fried calamari rings, the sliders (available in beef, lamb and chicken), the truffle fries - so aromatic!! and the thin crust pizza....5 stars from me for the service!! Really cozy atmosphere and a chill hang out. Not too crowded, and feels like home
4
Three of us came for lunch on a Friday. No reservations would have meant no table! We opted for spinach goat cheese salad, and soup for starters, and the fish, the beef duo and the chicken as our mains. And all opted for the apple tart! All good to great with generous portion
4
Although my first view was slightly negative after my entry soon I realized that I was wrong.The space of the restaurant it's limited like most of the restaurants in Singapore but when sat on my table and maybe because there were not so many around I managed to enjoy a well prepared dinner.The staff was extremely friendly and despite their Indian English accent I managed to understand what they were saying.I ordered a Rib eye stake and to my surprise was very good in taste and the way that was prepared. Only few restaurants in Singapore may serve nice meet with Euro /USA Standards since they have a heavy influence of the Far Eastern way of cooking i.e. small pieces of meat etcThey charged S$100 only a soup as first , teh main dish and plus a pint of local beer. It seems to be on the high side but usual for Singapor
5
Waow!!! What an experience!How could I describe the combination of the excellent food, ambiance, service... and of course the Chef personal touch?The quality of the products in a very traditional French cooking style is not only perfect. It's prepared with the brain, the hands and most importantly the heart. Portions are generous and so tasty. Yummy!I very highly recommend this place indoor and to chill out outdoor. But I cannot recommend any particular dish... they are all delicious.Love it
4
If you like meat done just right, a mixture of poultry and steak, this is the place to be! The steak is wonderful while you can't miss the chicken (yummy!) It's a relax place for friends and close business partners who love to share the joy of eating. It has both indoor and outdoor seating. Only drawback: it doesn't open on Sundays...
3
So the smell of the food was extremely strong - my lunch guest waited outside because of the fumes. Had the beef wellington which was very generous meat and foie gras - completely decadent. Come here if you like loads of meat - but they also have a fish portion too. Would not recommend this place for business due to the smell and may not suit everyon
3
I used to frequent Bar-roque, after being introduced to the place by a friend. And I loved it. This last visit was meant to be a bday celebration but the staff service was way below par. The lady was grumpy and sincerely just felt like she hated to be there. She told my mum "shift your seat. I need the space to clear plates." In a very sharp manner. No please no thank you, even thought we were very polite. At the price that the restaurant charged, such service was unacceptable. We left the restaurant not feeling happy at all. Very sad as I used to love the place.
4
We were 5 friends and came for dinner.1st cocktails: Mojitos are outstanding!!After we got couscous… Wonderful!!! Everything was there: merguez, mutton, veggies… amazing taste!And really big portions!It happens only & week per month but book a table, you won't regret!We highly recommend the place.Cherry on the cake, waiters and chef Stephane are really nice
5
We were there 3 times in different occasion , trying to test wether the quality of food standard remain the same . The food quality and services had not failed us . The chef even gave a free birthday cake on our last visit as it was my hubby's birthday . The portion and quality of food is as good as what u can get in so called top notch steak house or Resturant In Singapore . The chef and service staff gave good recommendation on the choices of food selection . A fantastic place even for communal dining . We really have a great time that night and will definitely come back for more .
1
The place was just a mess. Staff had no idea what they were doing. Mixed up orders, late serving, cold food. It was that bad that the chef and owner came out to serve us and gave us the whole dinner for free eventually. But sorry guys, it is not possible to return ever. Imagine you are bringing your date or friends and the whole thing starts all over again. The place is under normal circumstances not cheap and the price tag is simply not justified. You may be serving quality meat but if you do not get it served adequately then the whole experience is a farce. Service is part of the deal
5
We had the Charcuterie and the Beef Wellington. The cured meats are all made in-house and were EXCELLENT. Excellent pairing also with the jams and mustard seeds and I can't remember the other dip. But excellent.The Beef Wellington was out of this world. The pastry had more butter than the slab of fresh butter served with the oh-so-good bread. The beef - oh my the beef. Tender. Flavourful. Tender. Juicy. Tender. Oh. So. Good. It was served wtih foie gras on a bed of baby spinach. The taste on the palette was so good I was reluctant to ruin it with dessert. I just wanted it to stay in my mouth forever
5
I often stay close by and this bar offers a great venue for the single business traveller. Friendly staff and great food with happy hour deals!The staff are the best feature and offer fast service with a smile. Do yourself a favour and check it out
5
The staff at Bar Roque is very attentive, the french chef/owner Stephane is very charming and always on the floor taking care of his clients. Went there many time for lunch, drinks or dinner. Very pleasant atmosphere and triied most items on his menu, the grilled lamb leg and wagyu beef, the couscous, the taste flambé, the salad, the clams,.. Everything is absolutely delicious -i also recommend this place..
3
We haven't dined in here, but I go occasionally for their happy hour drinks as I work around the corner. They have 2 beers on tap. The service is generally ok, but yesterday was a bit slow. Yesterday we also ordered some finger food with our food. The tarte flambe was sensational. Totally amazing. However the chicken wings were at the other end of the spectrum - completely flavourless and dry. I have had better chicken wings at a hawker centre
2
I have no idea how this restaurant is rated so highly on trip advisor. The only reason I can possibly come up with is that staff are rating this place to get its ranking up.We went for dinner here at the end of our first day in Singapore. It wasn't much of a finale, more of an anti climax. I ordered a fish dish with seasonal vegetables. The vegetables were unrecognisable, being so over cooked they were all the same shade of grey. My partner had the beef wellington which although not terrible, was far from being memorable. They forgot our sides and when we asked for them were told they had run out of mashed potato. For this experience we then had to pay $150.To all people who rely on trip advisor for choosing restaurants, steer clear of this one. The Chinatown food stalls are much tastier and cheaper
5
Visited this with friends and we all were in agreement that it was delicious...cool settings , good service and great menu ..The beef wellington is unbelievable
5
Food was excellent! Ambient was cool!
Thanks Chef Alex for the wonderful presentation of food . Well done !
5
It's really an awesome ambience to dine in. Seafood is fresh, meat are fantastic and the desserts are just perfect. 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
5
Had dinner at bar roque on my birthday with my girlfriend... simple 3 course meal and was served by Kamal,Andre,Uhm,Rizal and Amirul. They made us feel like we were dining at a fine dining restaurant even though the price was not of a fine dining restaurant. Food was superb with the servers giving the right reccomendations. Lastly we were both extremely pleased with the restaurant giving me a birthday cake and all the servers and bartenders singing a birthday song for me. Will be visiting soon
5
This restaurant was recommended by friends and it lived up to every expectation. Interesting specials that were immediately ordered including a divine crab salad. It may be a grill as such, but the treatment of all ingredients is first rate. The wine list is impeccable and the service from Andrea was welcoming and professional. And yes, the meat dishes were superb. Now to plan a visit with friends so we can indulge in the tomahawks! (PS: we found the rooftop bar, Graffiti, at the Carlton hotel next door and it was a great spot to get your geo-bearings while having an early evening pre-dinner ale
5
This was at least the 5 or 6th visit to this reataurant and continue to be impressed by the quality of the food and service. Chef Alex fixed some very good dishes everytime. This time around, we had mussels as appetizer and fish as main. Both dishes were impressive. Will come back for sure in our next visit
5
With No doubt if you want to enjoyed real quality food and ambiance with best hospitality Bar-Roque is the place to be. The Chef and the all team is here to take personally good care of you. Tarte Flambee is a must ! I also agree with previous review , the selection and quality of meat they offer is probably the best value in Singapore.Keep space to finish your meal with the Nutella,banana Tarte Flambee . Thank you To chef Stephane and the Bar-roque team ! well done 
5
If you are looking for a meatfest with high quality meat, make sure you come by Bar-Roque. It isn't like any other steak house. Chef Stephane artistically combines grilling with a nice Mediterranean flair. Besides their monstrous tomahawk steak, the French style roast chicken, tarte flambee, duck rillete, and even the mash potatoes are simply superb. The kitchen is open and the staff delights in making sure your dining experience is one that you will remember fondly. A definite must if you are in Singapore
5
Lovely cheese board, good wellington boeuf filet.Decent lager beer in happy hour.Ambiance and decor it's cool, completed by the great assistance of Andrea who I wish you will be there at your table to suggest a pairing and close the loop.Worth a visit indeed.
5
Delicious meat and , texture good mashed potatoes . Very delicious lemon tart.Including the chef ALEX, hospitality spirit of the staff is the best of the shops .My first time in Singapore , now a really nice trip , thanks to the Bar-roque.Please go by all means here when you want to have a great meal ♪
5
Had dinner here last night. Food is still great and wonderful! Had a spinach salad, plus Chef special of the day which is a welsh lamb and flat iron steak. Both nice done and succulent! Always great t be back!
5
Exciting! Now Bar-roque is offering a great selection of wild caught fresh fish that are directly imported from the fishermen weekly!
I love them all!!! 😘✨👍🏻
Find out more about them with the friendly service team and wonderful Chefs from the restaurant!
5
This is the second time I've been here in the last 12 months the Tomahawk has been unbelievable both times!! Thoroughly recommend it!!
5
A beautiful dinner as always! Andrea and Chef Alex took such a good care of us! Amazing food and ambiance. Highly recommend the T Bone with the Ravioles.
Highly recommended!
5
1 for 1 on selected drinks until 8pm everyday is a really good deal, and there are discount on snacks during the happy hour as well. The tart flambé is amazing (it's like a very thin pizza). Drop by and give it a try, seriously!

This is my first time in Singapore and was fortunate to be here on business. Bar-roque was next door to my hotel and when I arrived I just wanted to go somewhere close to my hotel and somewhere relaxed. I was greeted with open arms by all of the staff. I was on my own and they were all so lovely. To make things even better I was served amazing food and drinks. It was busy but everyone was having a great time. All of the seats outside where taken. Because of this I came back again and again not just because it was close to my hotel but because I felt like I was with friends! The food is amazing. The staff are even more amazing. I recommend this place whole heartedly. Enjoy!!! P.s. Try the chocolate shortcake desert. AMAZING. X

Bar-Roque and Grill is my staple go to for a great meal. The atmosphere is always buzzing and Chef Stephane is always ready with a massive smile and a menu recommendation. His team in the kitchen is always warmly welcoming as you walk in pass his open kitchen and his service team is always at hand with attentive service. I have always enjoyed the meat choices on the menu. If Chef Stephane offers you a taste of his home made infused rums, do yourself a flavour favour and never ever say no
5
If you are searching for a nice place to share a moment around a good table, no need to search further you have found the right place! The crew will welcome you, chef Stephane will take care of you and the dishes will do the rest to transform a simple moment to a great one. Fresh products with real taste of ingredients. Bread that taste bread. Add the talent of the chef..

I visited Bar-Roque Grill on the street level of the Amara Hotel in Tanjong Pagar last night due to the fact that there was no availability of a restaurant in the hotel I was staying in which is right next door!The server staff were particularly friendly and informative. I was offered a steak which was not on the menu, which I took, and boy was it fantastic! And for Singapore, it was at a very reasonable price. Along with the steak, I was able to enjoy a nice glass of Merlot from Argentina - also reasonable in price.Overall, my experience was amazing! And it was surprising to find such great food at this type of outlet. The overall menu is French in style, however it is not classic French food. The quality of the food was really very high and the service was fast.I will be back - it is too good to pass by! Thanks Bar-Roque
5
Went there with French friends who knew the chef. We let the chef decide for several dishes we shared and all were great, from the flamkushe (tarts) to the tartare and the grilled meat and cheese. Everything tasted great and was very well cooked. We typed it all with great wines (rosÃ©, white and red). Un sans faute et un super moment. The chef is not only good but very fun
4
Best steak i ate in a while, specially with spinach on side. There was nice music and friendly service. Steak was not very big but soft and juicy.
5
Amazing char seared tomahawk steak was perfect, great wine and trimmings. All round good place for lunch but imagine it would be just as good for dinner. Will go again for sure.
5
We went there to celebrate a friend 50 year old birthday. The service was fantastic and they recommend the right type of meats for us. The beef and chicken were really tasty. The sommelier recommended the wines and they were both very good.
5
Stephane and his team are awesome. The food is incredible. Must try the tomahawk steak and also the tarte flambee. The wine list is very good and the staff attentive. Love the place. Have been there at least 10 times and will continue to go back. Up there with the best in Singapore
5
When you enter, the feeling is like you are in Europe. The Steak is excellent tender and tasty and the meat platters are perfect for any occasion. Friendly staffs, especially Chef Stephan whom comes and check making sure the food served is great. Overall, Fantastic place to visit
5
Visited this restaurant again after a good corporate dinner here 2 years ago. Brought my parents and girlfriend this time and they were all impressed with the food. We order the seafood platter for starters, meat platter and 3 vegetable sides for mains, followed by 2 desserts including the lemon tart. They were all very memorable amidst a relaxed atmosphere and I would not hesitate to come back here again
4
The food is excellent, particularly for the committed carnivore, with what seems like a particular commitment to foie gras. Portions vary from very large to huge, but the waiting staff will advise on how many plates you should order. They got it absolutely right with our party. It's always good to find a restaurant with the confidence to prepare meals in an open kitchen.The service was very attentive and professional - not always a feature of Singapore dining even in the top establishments.The restaurant does have very loud music. On the evening we were there, we were not the only ones who found this distracting. Most guests were of an age where they wanted to converse over dinner rather than playing games on their mobiles. Even though the staff were quite happy to move us to somewhere marginally quieter, the music was still obtrusive.There is also a strangely disturbing picture of what appears to be a deformed naked infant shouting at a fish. Might be good on the roof of the Sistine Chapel, but somewhat unsettling in a restaurant
5
Had one of the best meals ever in Singapore! Fantastic rustic food. Baby octopus salad was AMAZING! The dressing was a balance of sweet, spicy & tangy.. Explosion of flavors in every bite.. Great service, talented young chefs and not forgetting the Talented Exec Chef! The whole experience was the best ever.. Thank u.
5
We only had some bites and mostly wines, but nothing to complain about. It is not a cheap place, but the great location in the Bay area makes up for it. I sat outside and with a lot of fans it was very comfortable. Tried great wines from New Zealand, South and North America and also had a good white beer
5
Not only my favorite restaurant in Singapore, but the best welcome and food choice in town... So for this time, i ve been hiving a challenge to the chef : make a tourte aux ris de veau, aux morilles et foie gras ! The winter burgundy typical family dish : complex, rich but so good... Even in best french brasseries, this traditionnal succulent dishes disappear : here the Chef defeated the challenge with personnal twist, result was an absolute delish !!! After that big starter, we ve shared a beef platter with ravioles, spaetzle, grattin, cream spinach... Everything was fantastic again. No dessert but home prepared infused Rhum with Lichees, perfect ending. A great success, remarkable service, just love all of it 
5
Never ever had a bad meal in this restaurant. From classic French dishes to seasonal menu that uses really only the best and freshest products, with big and bold flavours! Definitely one of my #1 choice of restaurant in Singapore!
5
Very good products that the French Chef adapt and work on for his clients. Very different from other French restaurants in town. The ambiance is also very good and the employees very professional. 10/10
5
Must try their Wellington beef and their selection of wine and dessert wine! Service was also very good- professional and friendly at the same time. :)
4
Ordered roast chicken with broccoli as side , a seafood dish - love it , very tasty especially the chicken
Desert not fantastic
4
Great steak
Perfect atmosphere
The customer service was good.
I wish I could afford to eat there every night
3
We visited Bar-rouqe on a wrong night apparently. There was some renovation works going on and only ended towards the end of our night. Was looking forward to a good piece of steak but the tomahawk we ordered failed to impress. The cheese platter at the end of the night did not manage to salvage the situation either. Overall, a sad huge contrast to our first visit a year ago.
5
We are lucky to be living just around the corner from Bar-Roque so have dinned here on numerous occasions (in fact too many to count) and consistently it has been excellent. For this reason its one of our top restaurant choices to bring family and friends to. They have a lovely outside terrace for a more relaxed feel or inside is great when you fancy a more formal dinning experience or you are celebrating a special occasion. They offer both meat and fish dishes alongside fabulous daily specials. I normally opt for steak but the meat platters are perfect for those occasions when you just cannot decide!! Every time we have been it has been an enjoyable evening, whether we are alone or with friends. I would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a nice evening out
5
Again, I went to bar roque last Saturday as I was alone I did not go for the awesome tomahawk but tried the "onglet de boeuf". That was a wonderful choice: tender, great texture, perfectly cook and some raviole in the top made it a perfect solo dinner!As always, great service and nice outside ambiance !
5
Not my first time, always a great pleasure ! Used to the tomahawk nd the ravioles de Royan with Nutella banana tart, i made a twist this time with a marvelous Wellington perfectly cooked with a buttered tasty feuilletee paste, fois gras steak half roasted and blue cheese (real french one !!!) sauce... OMG !! Side dish tartiflette ravioles were soooo good and just the right quantity, a dessert was needed : Paris Brest ! Not the best ever but the ones who dont know that typically french dessert, have a try...Other guests had ribeye, octopus salad, everybody more than happy guaranteed.Conclusion : i love the place ! From simple to gastronomic dishes, there is a chef at the helm, and there are workhours and super selection of product behind each sauce, side or main... Super rare in Singapore 
5
It is always very difficult to describe a good experience because whatever you write, you will always think that it is not enough to describe your feeling and to convince others to try it also. So what to say about the food at Bar-Roque? It is amazing to see what you can get there. At a first glance you may think the menu is not very fancy, but just have a seat and ask for the Chef's recommendation and you will discover the quality of the products Stephane (the che)f is using, as well as the way he prepare them, being able to balance perfectly each ingredients of a dish for a fabulous taste.If you're lucky enough to have a chat with him, you will learn about his background, and you will understand how he can make it!I'm a regular at Bar-Roque but every time I go there, I know i'll be surprised again, like last week when I tried the "Challand Duck Tournedos"... I honestly didn't eat something similar for many years. So good it was, that it has decided myself to write something here today, which I usually do not. If you really want to spend a good time with a good food (and wine, because they also have very nice ones), GO THERE, WITHOUT HESITATIO
5
really good value for money. The staff and the chef Stephan are super nice! Definitely recommending this place!
3
This restaurant has definitively good meat. I have taken the rib eye, but it's 58 SGD. Profiterolles were not exactly like the classical recipe.
5
Exceptional authentic French cuisine! The food is prepared with soul, heart and hard sweat. Service is great, good wine list and good ambience.
Go for charcuterie that's homemade and get one of those delicious Poulet of the grill. Will be back.
5
Great food as always and welcoming service.
Stephane or Cory always have the time for their clients. We feel at home!
3
Good and service was good on the whole but we probably waited an hour for mains. Too long and 20 min after we asked
5
Fantastic starters and mains, some amazing dishes. loved the khouskhous lamb and the goat salad. very fresh.
4
My friend and I had the grilled chicken lunch set. The chicken was very delicious - it was moist, tender and juicy. The ambience was also friendly and staff were helpful and fast.
5
We brought our family here to celebrate our wedding, as we had a small wedding party of just our family after signing at the ROM. We could't have been happier. Everything was amazing, the service was great and each course was cooked perfectly and beautifully. Every request I had they honored, they really respected our special day and made for a wonderful wedding dinner. The food is french inspired, but it's not pretentious. Very respectful of the ingredients. Probably the best meal we have had in Singapore, and a great experience for our family who flew in from across the world for our special occasion. I was also impressed at how affordable it was, considering how amazing our meal turned out! Great value, great staff, great food. Fine dining quality without the stuffiness or exorbitant price
5
I have eaten at Bar-Roque numerous times since their opening and thought I should let other people know what they are missing.The food is incredible. The staff are wonderful. Sitting outside eating (yes there is an outdoor area as well an inside space), drinking wine listening to their fabulous playlists always = a great night out
5
Very good French restaurant that we visited twice lately:The first time we had a very good tasting menu. Nice refined dishes. The second evening was for the wild game menu: venison osso bucco, venison Wellington style and wild bore. Very generous portions in a family like ambiance. Good wine selection. Nice simple outdoor bar for an aperitif or last drinks
4
Service staff not so friendly, not so helpful. Had the hunting menu. Not so good. Regular menu would be better
3
staff are knowledgeable, but food not as good as we expected. tried the deer meat but personally find it too dry and hard. the seafood portion is quite small and nothing special.
4
Visited this French grill restaurant at Tanjong Pagar with friend, and that was pretty good dinner experience. I especially liked their beef tartar and beef platter. Service was great too. Will re-visit sometimes.
4
Great steak and very nice, friendly and attentative service.
Though not cheap, I would definately come back for more - good stuff!
5
Steakhouse and traditionnal french cuisine. Everything is good and cooked perfectly with passion and willingness to satisfy your appetite !
5
Very pleasant meal with lots of attention by well trained staff. Loved it and will be back. Fine New Zealand fish was delicious.
5
One of our favorite restaurant in SIngapore. The staff is very friendly, knowledgeable, prompt.I always go for the beef platter which is delicious. A choice of braised beef cheek pastry with a slice of foie gras, filet and wagyu. The meat is one of the best I ate in Singapore.For starter, a flammenkueche is nice to share with friends
5
Far from my hometown Paris, I have found the perfect place in Singapore. Great food, amazing crab salad, octopus salads and wonderful home smoked salmon. The beef is incredible and the raviole a must to try. If you are brave enough, don't miss the tarte flambÃ© banana and Nutella or the apple one.
4
This restaurant is really quite French!! The decor is fairly pretentious, however it is fine, despite the fairly obvious 'shock factor' of having a massive picture of Dionysus peeing (essentially a fat naked baby) covering most of one wall. The wine choice appears good, despite them not having the one we wanted. It would seem they like to push their own wine too as at every turn the question was 'do you want to try our own wine', so eventually we gave up and had cocktails!!For starter we had the charcuterie board, which as was great. Straight out of Paris and much of it supposedly smoked in-house. For mains my partner had steak and I had a couple of other starters of salad and smoked salmon. All good, especially the truffle oil fries, which are a favourite of mine!! I would definitely recommend. I always tend to find desserts disappointing and here was no different as they are always forgotten and I can always cook better, which is saying something! We had profiteroles and apple crumble tart here and they were really not nice, it might just be our taste though! If you like dry profiteroles stuffed with icy ice cream and a very bitter sauce or part frozen, part burnt apple tart, go for it! Don't let this put you off going for the main offering though (maybe try the almond biscuits with Nutella for dessert, they sounded nice!)In general the service was moderate to irritating. We basically had to ask the waiters to take the plates for the first two courses and had to wait 10mins for the dessert menus to be offered. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't awful, I just don't like having to watch waiters giggling in the corner while I've been sat with dirty plates in front of me for 10 mins. I do find that it's amazing how many times a waiter can look at your table of quite clearly finished with plates and walk past when they have to walk upstairs with them once they've cleared the table...
3
I liked the atmosphere and the service, the food was good. I had beef tartare. I was a bit disapoonted by the fact that french fries were not even home made and were not really good. We had also lamb ribs, too fatty and almost no meat on the ribs...The red wines are starting at over 80 sgd...I found the restaurant overpriced and will not come back as our experience was average. Spending a lot the seafood platter and cote de boeuf looked great 
5
Fantastic experience... Great food with even better service from its staffs. Will return for more....
4
The food was great at Bar-Roque. Service was excellent as well. Very nice atmosphere and close to our hotel so very convenient.
2
We got the beef steak and the price was just to high for that little piece of beef. It tasted pretty average too.
On the other hand the wine selection was very nice.
5
One of my favorite de french restaurant in Singapore. Always a pleasure to come to Bar-Roque.Stephane and his wife always welcome you with a big smile. They both are very passionate about their restaurant and their food.Food is always excellent. Can't wait to return
5
Had another great diner at Bar-Roque and chef Stephane Istel continues to impress.His hospitality is unequaled in Singapore, you literally feel you are part of the family. Starting as usual with a Tarte Flambee, followed by an excellent rib-eye from a happy free jumping Aussie cattle, and the meat platter to share ( lamb, chicken and ham)...Nice bottle of Lalande de Pomerol which you can also have by the glass or 500 cl .Not much space for dessert, but the fruit infused rhum is just magic, and a great way to finish the diner. A must try...Tasted a dish coming up on the menu to be launched soon....tell you more next month.Couscous and creme brulee were the specials.. will have to try that next time as well.Make sure you bookBon appeti

Our 3rd time here. We pass by Singapore often and we were taken the 1st time by local hosts. We were greeted by the Maitre D' and co-owner, Kori. We were suddenly engulfed by her warm friendliness. She whisked us to our table and went through the extensive wine list in detail. The food is sensational. The Lamb the night we went was fresh from NZ and it was imported as a whole Lamb. Chef Stefan Istel created the most amazing dishes with it. Kori paired it exquistley with a NZ Pinot Noir which worked amazingly well. Cut to last night which was our 3rd time at Bar-Roque and Kori greeted us by name and by sight. That is service (and memory!!) We were again spoiled by Chef Istels' amazing freshly flown-in Australian Kingfish. He came to the table and explained the Salt Encrusted King Fish and had suggestions as to its pairings. Kori once again suggested an amazing Riesling from Tasmania. Perfect!Don't miss this place and don't forgo the chance to chat to the Chef and Kori and get their suggestions on the day
4
Next door to our hotel, open late, yummy pizzas, and of course the truffle fries! We ate their multiple times, we were welcomed back and really looked after. Good menu, although we did not try their meats ( they have a lot), more went with their share plates and cocktails. Great atmosphere, fans (!). We ate indoors one night, not nearly as nice in terms of feeling. Outside on Gopeng street is best
5
If you are looking for pristine white table cloths and menus served in teeny weeny portions, Bar-roque is not for you. But if you are looking for consistently fabulous hearty dishes with super friendly ambience, look no further. Great menu and my family & I absolutely love the beef platter and octopus salad.And for those who are into it, you can even watch Chef Stephane & his crew prepare your meal in the open kitchen
1
Was looking forward to meal after all yhe good reviews. Sadly disappointed. The avocado that came with the smoked salmon appetizer was unripe hard and bitter. The cod in saffron broth I ordered was tough and tasteless and the skin was soggy instead of crisp as I had read in another review. The prawns were overcooked and the clams rubbery. Worst of all, the was an insect crawling around on the serving board on which our appetizer was served
4
Situated in the heart of town inside the Amara Hotel this funky eatery seems to specialise in French style grill so you have to like your red meat to consider this place. Service was great. The cold meats serving plater was idea to share amongst 4 and then we got one of the grill plates and shared that too. I wasn't a big fan of the cold meats plate but others seem to like it. The meat was superb though - cooked to perfection. Chef came out and asked us how we were going which was a nice touch. Extensive wine menu to match the food although I did not feel confident that our waiter could pick the right wine for us.
5
My family (especially my father) and I love this restaurant!! They have the friendliest staffs and incredible chefs! I totally recommend this place for a family for friend gathering though it is pricey, but it definitely worths every penny! I would re omen to anyone to order the delicious Tomahawk (be warned, not to be devoured by just one single person)!
5
I popped in for a few drinks and snacks after looking for good places in Singapore and this place is brilliant and become my literally living room. with great balcony and awesome service We've tried a few cocktails and all were so well made, explained and presented. Then with the super friendly team and amazing Chef I found the kitchen as one of the best french restaurants in the world actually . All in all definitely a cool place to hang out
5
I was staying opposite at the Carlton City Hotel, and had never stayed in that part of town before. I had my favourite restaurants in Singapore that I have visited regularly over years, but they were a taxi ride away and I was just wanting something local. I walked out of the hotel to see what looked like an outside bar, which was the front for a really cool restaurant. I went in and ordered an wine and looked at the menu. It looked good, the food came out, it was brilliant, and so was the wine, so I have been back every time ever since. Incidentally though there is a restaurant behind the outdoor bar area I have never been in, as I always eat outside. The staff are excellent, really engaging, which is refreshing for Singapore. They make great recommendations for wine and for food, and I have not once been disappointed. It is a must-go- back-to place for me even if I don't stay at that particular hotel
4
We just moved to Singapore and during the moving phase we just couldn't face cooking so we decided to try some local places within walking distance. Bar-roque Grill was one of those. What a find! First time we went was a Saturday night, and it was busy but we managed to get a table without a booking. We started with a carpaccio of scallop which we shared and it was a very generous portion and delicious. My husband wanted steak so ordered a Wagyu steak and I had a lamb rump. We had some side dishes, sauerkraut, mashed potato and fries. Everything was absolutely delicious! Meat was BBQ'd beautifully with so much flavour. The mashed potato was truly the best I have tasted for a very long time!The second visit the front of house person, Kori Millar recognised us and made us feel so welcome. This was a Thursday night and the restaurant was packed so we went next door and had a drink for 10-15mins. The table wasn't quite ready so we stood at the bar and the chef said he will prepare us a snack. Well the snack turned out to be the most delicious onion and cheese tart/bread that we have ever eaten! We then both had the steak and some side dishes - spinach and mushroom, french fries and sauerkraut. As much as we wanted to try dessert, we were full! We took some wine with us for dinner as you are allowed to BYO Mon- Thursday, which suits us! This is definitely on our favourite list! Friendly staff, great service and excellent food
5
I have dined a few times at Bar-Roque Grill and every time exceeds my expectations, which may I say are high! I have been very fortunate to dine in many exquisite restaurants around the world, from fine dining to quirky hole's in the wall. There is something about the food at Bar-Roque that is so deliciously moorish almost like you are at a french provincial home eating some of the best flavours you have ever tasted.It's a must visit restaurant when in Singapore
5
We had a gift voucher for dining at Bar-Roque and decided to take my in-laws there for Father's day dinner. We had called to make a reservation, but when we turned up, there seemed to be no record of the booking. What could have been a fairly unpleasant situation was superbly turned around; after some hurried consultation, they put us at a table with much apologies, and from there on, the evening was a great pleasure. The staff's attention to detail was impeccable; they were always near enough to get their attention, without being over bearing. Water glasses were always topped up, dishes were cleared away with alacrity, and all this done with a great touch of casual ambience with chatty waiters. They knew their product too, as they recommended some very good food; the giant T-bone was perfect for us meat lovers (F-I-L loved it) while for the M-I-L who was not so hot on meat, they recommended a beautiful seared fish which went down very well. The beef was done to perfection, and the presentation itself was certainly mouth watering already! The servings were sliced in good sized portions (not too thin that they were insubstantial, and not too thick that it was too chewy), and right at the end, the waiters were attentive enough to realize that we were literally getting down to the bone, and they took it away to shave the meat off. It returned with fresh veggies, which was a nice touch. And to top it off, right at the end of the meal, we were kindly presented with an apple pie on the house, as an apology for having mixed up the reservations. We will certainly be back
5
I was at Bar Roque last night and the chef Stephane recommended the beef platter which is just amazing, especially the oxtail pithivier with pan fired foie gras on the top is just to die for.I brought friends from Hong Kong over there and they were super happy with their first Bar-Roque experience.The atmosphere, the quality of the food and the friendliness of Stephane and Corrie definitely makes Bar Roque on the best restaurant in Singapore
5
Last night I and my husband had amazing dinner at Bar-roque, we had very very good time and very much enjoy our dinner, we had French style Buk Kut Teh it was such a delicious meal. Bar-roque is One of my most favorite restaurant in Singapore, consistently great quality of food, warm hospitality, good service staffs and delicious food! Must have : Escargot, NZ Little Neck Clam, Foie gras And if you are meat lover you shouldn't miss Tomahawk steak...Yum yum yu
4
Fresh Loch Finn oysters was prepared well retaining the ocean freshness. The Hokkaido scallops would have tasted even better if yuzu was used as described in the menu. Lamb shank was generous in portion yet quite tender! We will return.Service could be a bit better in keeping with their fusion heritage
5
Second time here for dinner. Ordered the 5-course tasting menu (SGD98++), good portions and variety. Chose the grilled octopus salad, the Wagyu and the apple pie. Restaurant feels cozy, interesting art on the walls. Would not recommend the Archipelago draft beer. Service is decent and attentive. Food is a bit on the salty side. Coziness of the restaurant makes it good for couples or small groups, though we did see one 8+ person group
5
have been a few times both as a couple and with friends. Food, wine and service has been consistently good each time and it is our go-to restaurant.
5
This is one of the best dining experiences we have had in Singapore. Try having dinner on the outdoor patio, it's a great vibe and the food is consistently amazing!! Must haves: Spinach Salad, Fish/Scallop Carpaccio, NZ Little Neck Clams, Free-range Chicken, and (for the hungry ones...) the Beef Platter! You really can't go wrong with any dish here, but these are some of our favorites! You will feel at home here with Kori and Stephane. Make sure this is on your go-to list of restaurants in Singapore! Great food quality, excellent wine list, and great service...always
5
This was my third time coming here - after my first visit, I've come back every time I've gotten a chance to. The food certainly isn't cheap - as a student/fresh grad, I can't come as often as I would like to - but it is extremely value for money. This time around, we had the Tomahawk - one of their signature dishes, a ginormous piece of juicy, delicious beef. It didn't disappoint. It also lets the more imaginative of us pretend that we're eating dinosaur meat. I also really enjoy the grilled lamb and the salad that comes with it. Also, MASHED POTATO. I know, who goes to a restaurant to eat mashed potato for $10? But they have one of the best mashed potatoes I have ever had. It's buttery and creamy and smooth and just all-around Awesome. One random thing I like about this place is that the AC is kept at a really decent temperature - not too hot and not too cold. It may seem small, but it definitely contributes to the great dining experience.One thing that I don't like so much is that it can get pretty loud because of the restaurant design, but that's okay, because once your food comes, you'll be so busy eating it won't matter
5
We had the set lunch and chose the pork rillette, for mains the roast chicken and mushroom risotto. Banana Nutella tart for dessert. The service was really good, staff was engaging and really knowledgable. and the food was so good!!! Really like it and good value for money. Would go back again soon
4
Minimalist, authentic cooking using good raw materials. Meat dishes are a winner. Service is good and waitets have a good food knowledge. Making a reservation is a breeze. Chef Stephan has a good grasp of culinary skills and experience to bring the best out of the raw matrials used. Home made desserts that are comforting.
2
There are better French restaurants at Tras Street than this one. It was my boyfriend's birthday, we ordered chef menu - so plain. Taste was normal but nothing special at all for the price that we paid. It is more like any western meals we had, nothing French at all. The staff were so not thoughtful and didn't even arrange a candle on the dessert. The atmosphere was chaotic, noisy and cheap. The wall paint was falling off. Choice of decoration was tasteless. Can't say this is on par with how tasteful French restaurants should be
5
I have been to Bar-Roque a few times with my friends to hve a long lunch. The chef always surprised us with a great menu and .... what to say, the food was great stuff.The staff is also very good taking care of the customers. In total a great experience and for sure they will see us again soon..
4
Elegant decor that does not come across as stuffy at all. At dinner, the restaurant was dimly-lit - creating a warm, cosy ambience that's perfect for groups and intimate dates.Food-wise, it was tasty and comforting. However, while I did enjoy certain elements of the dishes, I didn't find any of them particularly outstanding.Overview of the dishes we had:Flambee in 'The Classic' flavour - A thin-crust pizza-like base topped with bacon and onions, this was a good choice. It was tasty without being too salty.Free-range Chicken - The chook was tender and flavourful, but what I liked more was the velvety and more-ish potato mash that accompanied it. Cod a la plancha - Cod was a little overcooked for my liking, but thankfully wasn't dry nor flaky. The saffron broth was piquant enough to whet the appetite.Smoked Iberico pork rack - This was served with a delicious side of creamy ravioli. The pork was nicely grilled, with just the right balance of fat. Ravioli "Royan" - This was similar to the side of ravioli (as above), except this was served with earthy mushrooms. Loved the al dente texture of the pasta.
5
Found Bar Roque through a recommendation and I could not have been more impressed. I took two large groups of important customers on two separate evenings and both occasions were made a roaring success by Kori (co-owner) and her team. The food was excellent overall but in particular, the charcuterie, salt baked fish and the amazing bone in steak were mouth-watering! All the staff were excellent and really made for two memorable evenings. Thanks a million!!!! Paul
4
Walked in on one hot afternoon, in Singapore, and especially tired after an early morning of photography at the Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve with a group of friends on a rare treat day off. This place was a real find, the minute we walked in, the ambiance was perfect, cool and softly lighted, and we immediately wanted to stay. The menu, was the next surprise, interesting and well presented food choices, even for a lunch, menu, especially, since we had just left a restaurant nearby disappointed, because of the lack of choices for lunch. The food, turned out perfectly made, just as good as it sounded on the menu, the highlight for us that day was the sharing Beef Platter, perfectly cooked and juicy. The staff were all very professional and we will definitely be back for more, and will keep you posted

I went alone in one of my business trip!!! and I feel like at home. Amazing food, amazing beef and very good service. You have to go it if you are in Singapore.

Food was great, 4 of us shared the oysters, escargots, and the tomahawk steak. That was probably the highlight.

My husbands bday was around the corner and I wanted to treat him for dinner, just the 2 of us, no big party as it was on a Monday.After some back and forward thoughts about where to bring him, I have decided : BAR ROQUE it is.Yes, we are pretty regular guests, but on an occasion like a bday you don't actually want to take a risk that the restaurant won't be good, right?He was very positively surprised and we made our way there.Once stepping it, the staff and the owners gratulated him and offered us a drink with them to have a toast.After sitting down at the table, we have decided to choose from the a la carte menu as they have updated their menu and there are few ned dishes that we wanted to try.The concept moved more into general French cuisine - not only Alsacian anymore.We started our dinner with some sea food like oysters, marinated salmon and an amazing scallop carpaccio, followed by my favorite dish - the white clams casserole - and my husband took Wagyu beef with fries and the amazing raviolis.All was super tasty and big! So we didn't have space anymore for dessert.As for drinks & wines a must try is their homemade "rum arrangee" which is basically white rum infused over weeks with different fruits. They have like 10 flavors or so, really really something special for Singapore.The wine list highlights mostly French and New World wines, a good selection at decent pricing. The other good thing is that they offer a 1for1 wine bottle deals, so if you bring your own wine, you don't pay corkage if you buy one from them.Once we finished the dinner, we discovered that they are actually having a late night event, which was the after show party for the "Pellegrino Asia's Best 50 Restaurants" .So we ended up staying and having a party with the best chefs from Asia… GREAT!Thanks Bar Roque for another AMAZING experience!!Keep it up

I was lucky enough to go to Bar-Roque Grill on a number of occasions during a recent stopover to Singapore. I was able to try a number of dishes but as a purveyor of fine french food, I found myself returning to the foie gras & steak options no matter how good the other dishes were. I loved the ambience, the tasteful eclectic interior and the open kitchen concept. The staff were all highly professional and I loved the charming Chef Stephane; not only an outstanding chef but a character with a magical je na sais quoi. His second in command, a Singaporean native with a huge knowledge & passion for culinary artistry was also completely charming as was the hostess, the delightful Kori from New Zealand. They were incredibly hospitable and sent a classic Tarte Flambe & a glass of wine to me at the bar to ensure I wouldn't go hungry or thirsty after my wallet was stolen at the airport & I was on a limited budget until emergency funds arrived. Such is the warmth of the people & the place. I would definitely encourage everybody to try the foie dishes and the wagyu beef - or any of the beef options. In retrospect, looking at the menu I am disappointed in myself for not trying some of the diverse options it offered, but the fact of the matter was that the foie gras was just too good to go past & anyway, I'll be back! http://www.bar-roque.com.sg/pdf/bar-roque-dinner-menu.pd

Welcoming, casual and quirky corner restaurant in Amara Hotel in Tanjong Pagar that serves delectable creations of Chef Owner Stephane. The charcuterie has a wonderful selection of pate, cold meats, foie gras and crisp toast. The octopus salad is a unique and amazing combination. The clams and sausages dish is another unusual combination that was thoroughly enjoyed. We had a beef platter that included the winning oxtail pie. Leave space for dessert - the hot profiteroles are served with Nutella! Superb! The tea is served in a heavy red porcelain pot that can easily be shared amongst 3-4 people - Keeps hot in the pot and certainly value for money. We struggled with a pot each so do take note to share!Chef Stephane is not just a creative and talented chef but also a personable, warm and friendly host. Service was excellent.

Since the opening in July 2013 I never did a trip to Singapore without going to Bar-roque. Chef Stephane never stops to amuse me. From the whole roasted chicken to the traditional charcuterie platter, it’s all about taste and tradition. The restaurant itself is elegant, provocative but yet original design. The team and the chef always have so much passion and love to surprise their guests

Incredible staff. Trendy place, lots of energy. Food was high quality and pretty good, but I wasn't overly impressed by the flavor. Not sure it matters, but the chef was not there the night I visited. I'd return for the quality ingredients, but to not be blown away by food.
4
Came here today to try the 3 course set lunch at $40++. I opted for the duck terrine for starter, the lamb for main course (an extra $10), and the apple pie and ice cream for dessert. Food standard was very good, service was efficient. Convenient location near the Amara hotel. Worth a visit
5
We were delighted to find French cuisine of such high standing in Singapore. We shared the charcuterie platter - superb. Once the clam dish was explained we couldn't resist and it too was excellent. Interesting wine list, we enjoyed the Spanish red.The ambiance was wonderful. We dined by the open kitchen, it was full of movement and kitchen clattering. At the large table a group of business people were enjoying a shared meal. Lots of laughter and enjoyment making the atmosphere friendly and fun. At the end of the meal we finished our wine on the outdoor bar. Casual and relaxed the end to a perfect evening.Our tip for this restaurant: ask the staff to explain the menu, there are some gems that come alive with more explanation. And did I mention the foie gras - delicious.

Booked via Chope and visited this place twice on 29 Oct and 28 Nov. Here's the short, but precise review: 1) 29 Oct Visit:Met my friend here for a lunch meeting. Ordered the 3 course meal.Gave feedback to Kori Millar, co-owner that I felt discriminated, or at least left out as the lead chef, Francois, was entertaining guests of Caucasian origin. Food was average, service was slow and horrible (servers only paid attention to those who drank wine). Gave up waiting and requested to pack my dessert instead.Kori tried to argue and explain that they were understaffed and asked me to return again to try and they will improve. 2) 28 NovAnother visit, booked via Chope. Got email confirmation the night before. Service was not that much better, had to keep waving and ask for iced water topup. Food-wise, not any improvement. Didn't get to see Francois the lead chef this time round, but still saw obvious "better" service to Caucasian and to those ordering wine.Kori - For those who care, they will provide feedback, but if there's no improvement even after the 2nd visit a month later, then, you really do deserve this feedback
5
I had the Arrawatta Trinity grass-fed beef and 'oh my God' simply exceptional. Combine this with a magic atmosphere and superb host Stephane, it made for an evening of enjoyment unparalleled in Singapore.
5
Opt for the platter to share.... and the waiter serving us on the lower deck was unbeatable. ... professional, friendly and prompt. What else can you ask for?
4
Chef Stephane brings personality and passion to his cooking, yet doesn't overcomplicate anything. The grilled meats are unadulterated, with the natural flavours allowed to shine. The side dishes are excellent - try the mushrooms, the mini pasta, and the mashed potatoes.
5
Just perfect, service very professional, food perfect. Good wines. We spent a very nice evening,. I recommend to ask to the Chef, he will do his best for your satisfaction.
3
I went with wife and daughter. Had 3 choices from wine list before I found 1 that they actually had. Shared a meat platter which was very good (tasty and tender). Got lots of visits by various staff - replacing plates and cutlery, topping up wine after every sip. Just fell a bit intense. Given all the options in Singapore probably wouldn't return.
3
My wife and me had a dinner last week, great delicious food from the start to the end, great job to the Chef Stephane. But in term of service, need to keep up with the standard of the food, half the time we were trying to catch their attention
5
Ive been to Bar Roque several times for dinner, lunch or just drinks.Its one of the very few restaurants in Singapore that I visit on a regular basis.The atmosphere is so welcoming and relaxed, the food is to die for and both Stephane & Kori are just the perfect couple to run a place like this."Love is on the plate" is their slogan - and trust me - its even more than that!!Bar Roque serves authentic, rustic and real French food with its best fresh products and amazing flavors!I have tried almost everything there, as we usually come with a group of friends and share the food, and there was not a single time something that wasnt good !Besides the food, they also have a great wine list and their homemade "Rhum Arrange" , which is a self made infused Rum - with fruits , vanilla etc.This is one of the best places to spend an awesome and fun dinner with friends with lots of food, drinks and laughter!Have fun !
5
Look no further, you have now found the best place to grab dinner.Wine list is great, and if you are not sure the somelier will give you a hand.Food is excellently cooked, the prices are reasonable, everything is fresh and the menu will change over time depending on what the chef orders from the his suppliers. Speaking of the Chef, he is a great guy from France and loves to cook and share a drink with you. Seriously this restaurant is just fantastic!The staff are incredible and the service is impeccable. The food, honestly the best meal I have had in Singapore without eating a tiny portion at some pretentious restaurant. This place has flare and all the right ingredients to make for a great night

Bar-Roque Grill is attached to the Amara Hotel, but don't hold this against it, and don't be tempted to stay in the hotel. It is a casual dining experience, but the quality of the service and the food is in line with any multi-starred establishment. The superiority of the overall dining experience is due, in a large part, to the excellent team running it; Kori and Dion at front-of-house, who never forget a face; and Stephane who runs the open-plan kitchen (one for the ladies...)Food: We started by sharing a Tartes Flambees, which is an excellent house speciality. We followed this with a relatively-boring Charcuterie Board; in spite if being a basic option, it seems to be very easy to get wrong, as I have experienced frequently. But everything on the board at Bar-Rocque tasted sublime, and was well accompanied by pickles and breads. To finish we had a delicious hot Saint Marcelin cheese. Although the wine list is limited, there are two things about the wine options that I thoroughly appreciate; my favorite Provence rose (Whispering Angel from Chateau d'Esclans) served by the glass from double-magnum bottles (3 litres). And BYO is available for free on a one-for-one basis; so if you order a bottle of white from the list, there is no corkage charge for the red that you bring in - other restaurants please note.Overall, nothing to complain about, and plenty to thoroughly recommend

Dining in French restaurants in Singapore is always an expensive business,and often a disappointing one as the chefs serve you the latest miniaturisation in nouvelle cuisine that they can dream up.This is especially so when Asian chefs are involved.So it was refreshing to visit Bar-Roque where the owners were French (I believe) and the experience quite analogous to one you might have in Provincial France.It started well with a choice of carafes of red and white wine.In France,you can always get a carafe of wine,and often that is a good choice.For instance this was lunch-time where a bottle for two can be too much alcohol,and a glass is often minuscule and always over-priced.The food was wholesome,large portions and truly French.My starter of savoury tart was excellent as was the main course of grilled duck with blue cheese salad.The service was attentive without being in your face,and the decor is pleasant,despite being in the confines of a hotel,which can often lead to a shopping centre sort of atmosphere.I hardly ever review a restaurant by giving five stars,and perhaps should not here as I did not have room for the desserts (they looked good though).Highly recommended,though it would be interesting to go back in the evening as often restaurants pile on the costs for dinner as compared to lunch
4
Brilliant service, friendly, accommodating and always there for a chat. The food is pretty good as well
2
It was written in a blog that this is one of the top 20 restaurants in Singapore. Err... no. It's nowhere near top 20 at all. The food's okay, but nothing spectacular. The service is average as well, and the dessert took forever to arrive.
5
Really friendly, welcoming atmosphere. Absolutely amazing steak, can't recommend their Tomahawk Ribeye enough. You can't go wrong with this little Kiwi spot in Singapore.

Recently, for our anniversary, my husband took me to Bar-Roque Grill on recommendation from colleagues. After we were seated, my husband told them it was our anniversary, so the staff seated us away from others, which made for a more intimate dinner. We decided to go with whatever the chef wanted to cook for us, which also had wine pairings (separate charge). Stephan, the chef, came to us and explained what he was going to prepare. My husband, who is half French, answered in French and we had Kir Royales while waiting for the first course. Not only was every course delectable, but the staff was extremely attentive and friendly, without being overbearing. We ended up having to take the main course home as we were so full, but managed room for desert. We will definitely return for another meal! It was more than a meal; it was an experience! I suggest that if you decide to dine there, that you put yourself in the hands of Stephan and let him prepare what he chooses for you. You will not regret it

Chef Stephane's love for what he does is what I always remember after I leave bar roque. His passion and love for food shows on his plates and there's no other place in Singapore where you can watch your food being prepared and actually interact with chef himself. He's a ball of fire and has nerves of steel opening up his own place after successfully working with Daniel Boulud. His restaurant is casual and relaxed. What I love most about the menu is that he does the simple things right. No where else in Singapore have I tasted a proper free range roast chicken so pure and moist. Sometimes many new restaurants tend to over complicate things and forget the basics. Today I had the most divine puff pastry wrapped oxtail ragu with a bordelaise jus. It's a very simple dish garnished with sautéed spinach and mushrooms. What excites me is how delicious a simple meat pie can be. Kori, the general manager, also has to be accounted for in the success of bar roque. Singapore is a pretty tough place to find world class service due to many foreigner laws. However kori has that world class oomph about her. Her elegant charm and smile and KNOWLEDGE of the produce and what's being served is unrivaled. I really hope bar roque can maintain it's standards over the years because it is a place I've grown very close too. Thanks Stephane and Kori for creating such an unbelievable dining experience and remember- keep it simple and do it right. ;)

Chef is French ( Stephan), his wife from New Zealand, Holly,and this charming couple prepare & serve one of the best french food in Singapore; as appetizer flamen kuche is divineYou have also to try " bouillabaisse á la langouste"( lobster stew ) which is a pure blissI come back each time I stay in Singapore, strong advis

I hve been severala times and each time enjoyed a pleasant evening with great food, good value and good service. Introduced to it via some Discount Coupons but was never treated anything less than a full paying customer. I have returned several times with different people and alway a good experience. Food well presented, good variety and tastes really nice and fres
5
Best food for non-Asian food in Singapore. The best wait staff and owners. Amazing place which is full of energy. The food is first rate. The steak can be be cut with a fork. I am overjoyed to find and establishment such as this. Thanks for a great dinner and cherry rum! See you tomorrow. (That's how good it is)

Came here for dinner in a group and ordered several dishes, including the seafood platter, the eponymous meat platter and the whole roasted fish served w bouillabaisse broth and squid and prawns, a few other side dishes, red wines and a couple of desserts.For me the dishes which stood out were the roasted fish and the rack of lamb (in the meat platter). The seafood platter was just average and the oysters were not the freshest. The roasted free range chicken in the meat platter was unevenly seasoned and some portions tasted bland. With regard to kurobuta ham in the meat platter, I thought it was quite a waste to use kurobuta pork as the ham did not taste too different from regular ham although it tasted pleasant enough. Desserts were alright but did not excite.Prices are close to the levels at DB Moderne Bistro. We thought that the servings were generally on the small side given the pricing. The seafood platter looks impressive but the servings of the individual items are not substantial. Although well executed, the serving size of the side dishes (ie roasted vegetables, spinach, fries etc) was just enough for one person at ten dollars per serving. Service was attentive and could not be faulted.Atmosphere was convivial if a bit noisy (it was crowded when we were there and the space is not particularly large)
5
It is Chef Stephane Istel! whipping scrumptious food internationally and finally settling in Singapore to offer his best. The restaurant has a great cozy interior, loving every details and effort put into the restaurant setting. The seatings are comfortable.The open concept kitchen allows us to have a feel on how hard these amazing chefs work to assemble us a first class dining.I will definitely be back
4
Really good food, nice wine and excellent service. Great place for a casual dinner with friends, or when on work travel by yourself.
5
one of the best meals I had for ages
try the tomahawk steak and you will agree, very special
very good and attractive service staff only add to the overall superb experience
we be back soon

Highly Recommend with Great Services.
The menu comes with good spread of choices and giving you the taste of Country Style French Cuisine.
Good for friends or corporate gathering...
4
Must try and the best is to ask the chef what he proposes. if you are a group, good to ask him a special menu. Yummy apple tart !
5
This restaurant in cbd location has its self got very good charm !
Very good concept !

Over all very gud experience
Thnks to kori and chef to take care our table

Personally like the way of cooking.I like the charcuterie plater which got so many flavour in there ...presentation was rustic and the bar tender take a good care on us...well done !

This is a terribly inconsistent and crowded restaurant with some dreadful flaws which will prevent us from giving it another chance.The menu appears promising – flammekueche, various seafood options, sharing platters for charcuterie, beef or an assortment of other meats (chicken/ham/lamb). Overall food tasted good – clearly Stephane knows what he’s doing – having said that, he doesn’t seem to have spent a second thinking about any other aspect of what a restaurant should be about.Service is amateurish at best, with a very weird mix of staff that seems jumbled together without any cohesive training. A couple of the more senior guys appear knowledgeable but this is undermined by other colleagues. Additionally, for a restaurant so highly focused on meat, the wine list is appalling – many wines listed are not available, the advice is terrible (after asking 2 waiters, neither of whom could articulate one sensible word on the wine list, they beckoned a more senior colleague (possibly Kiwi or Australian) but her fairly basic comments in no way convinced us she had a clue) and what is available is over-priced (as is de rigueur in Singapore) but unacceptably also very boring. The chef is friendly enough – delivered a few dishes himself and came round offering some pineapple rum (which he announced to have had 3 glasses already) but didn’t asked about our meal nor did he stay to talk and that’s probably a good illustration of the overall impression – no real clue about what hospitality should be about.Go if you crave a decently cooked sirloin (but there are many other options in town in far better locations than the drab Amara hotel), avoid if you have any other expectations
5
I was very surprised by the relaxed ambience and decor when I walked in, it wasn't what I was expecting when out the front.The staff were very converse with the menu and the food was simply amazing. I didn't want the meal to finish! I will be back again next time I'm in town
3
Great staff, let down by a menu where three of out first choices were not available (and that is out of two people just choosing an entree and a main). Similarly the first two wines we selected were out of stock. This took the gloss off what was very good food and a good atmosphere. Expensive, but standard justifies that. If only the availability matched, it could be much more highly rate
2
We went to Bar-roque with great expectations for my wife's birthday. Sadly it failed to deliver in every aspect. Service was dreadful and slow although it improved when some more experienced servers took over towards the end. Food was unexciting and bland. The menu descriptions certainly need to be refined as they tend to be quite misleading. The rotisserie chicken as a signature dish is fairly tasteless. It could really do with some thought.The restaurant itself is plesent yet they could do with turning down the AC. Tables are way to close to each other to the extent you are almost involved in your neighbours conversation.Overall no reason to return which is disappointing as I had high hopes
4
Fantastic NZ/AU restaurant in Bar-Roque Grill.
Excellent food, great service and drinks. Good to share in a grill with your friends or collegues and have good beer.
Excellent and will go again.
5
just had a wonderful experience at Bar-Roque. the food was excellent, and the staff were fun, engaging, and quite knowledgeable. I would highly recommend this restauarant for either business, or leisure travelers.

Discovered the Chef at DB Bistrot Singapore during a visit 12mths ago and heard he was looking to branch out on his own.Upon my return I did some asking around & found the place was Bar Roque- needed to book as it has become rather in demand (always a good sign).We tasted the flamenkuche that was also on the menu at DB BM and it was as tasty as our last one. Foie gras and soupe were also very good and authentic- though the fig in the foie gras made me feel they were being a little stingy- next time on the side, not in the terrine itself please.Special mention to the toasted brioche with the foie gras (excellent) and fresh baked bread.Main was the filet which was cooked rare to perfection- not always the case in Singapore where restaurants often destroy great beef.Only niggle was a staff member who attempted to start clearing my plate before others had finished eating.Doing that is a Cardinal Sin in a good restaurant. What is nice however is that the staff and Chef are friendly, engaged and customer oriented. I am willing to bet this will be addressed going forward.Will return and recommend

I have never been a big poster of reviews on trip advisor but since being in Singapore I have tried to pass on my views as I have experienced so many average meals in Singapore which have been very expensive. The same could not be said about Bar Roque. Knowledgeable staff who knew what they were talking about and knew what ingredients went into which dish. Great wine selections and great food. In particular I had the Clam, Garlic Pork sausage casserole. Delicious and unusual. The smells that came off if when place in front of me were amazing. My wife had the mushroom Ravioli and she loved it. Portions sizes are great and all in all I would recommend that you try this out. Its better than most of the restaurants weve experienced to date. Well done the team at Bar Roque
3
I too, too not understand the rave reviews about Bar-Roque... My lunch was average at best, and it was only after I discovered that the chef here opened DB Bistro that I understood why the food wasn't very exciting at all... I'll give him points for being friendly and engaging with diners, but I'm afraid that's about it.
2
I have been to this place with some friends and I was not really impressed by the food, not a great value for money.The wine selection is boring! Whenever I patronise any restaurant, I like to discover something new that we are not able to find in Singapore. Hugel by glass is something you can find in Cold Storage and cheaper
4
Really Bar-Roque is worth a visit. The food is excellent. We took advise and weren't disappointed! The steak is a must. Every dish we had was stunning, rich in flavour and superbly presented. The atmosphere is fun, lively but intimate. Services relaxed, personal and welcoming. A new restaurant that deserves to do really well
5
I have try Bar-roque grilled following my friends advice and I can tell you I did not regret it. Once I arrived I was amazed with the décor of this restaurant. The crystal chandelier, the painting of cherubim drinking red wine and the lounge music make you feel confortable and in the mood for a feast!!!I sample some of the Chef specialties like the Alsacienne tarte flambee, home made charcuterie platter and super fresh imported Newzeland seafoods. Simple, tasty and well mastered in the French tradition. The wine that I was advice by the charming manager was in perfect match with food, the service was flawless and attentive.Simply Perfect, I will be back with friend for sure on my next trip to Singapor
5
Stephane Istel a very talented chef , trained by Daniel Boulud , has open a casual / chic venue using extremely good products . You will enjoy french classics , some with a twist .The decor is warm , the restaurant has a wonderful open kitchen with a rotisserie .You will not be disappointed !
5
First remark: Tripadvisor shows the wrong location (at least today 9 NOV 2013) Although the address is correct, this restaurant is not located on Sentosa island.Very nice atmosphere and music. We had a tarte flambée. Very thin bread, like in the original Alsace. A pleasure. After that we ordered a steak tartare. I believe its not on the menu card. Mine was mild spicy, just delicious. A nice address to recommend.
5
Superb, succulent chicken, mouth watering steak, delicious sides and starters. Good wines, friendly service. Great vibe, music and ambience. Really hard to fault this place. So glad we went. We will be back.
5
The level of service and quality of good is amazing. The styling is beautiful. A three course set lunch menu was a bargain at $38. Coffee was really nice- much better than elsewhere in Singapore.
5
If you want great service, great food from a great chef with great service this is the place to come in Singapore.We followed French Chef Stefan here from DB Moderne and he has excelled himself. He is also excellently complimented by Kiwi Maitrede Doni (you must ask him how he got his name.....!) and his energetic staff.Every course was sublime, the rotisserie chicken special was particularly tasty (go for the whole not the half!) and the banana/nutella flambee for dessert was the icing on the cake! Vegetarian fine dining is often a challenge to chefs in Singapore but Chef Stefan is probably the best vegetarian fine dining chef in the country so you're veggie you will not be disappointed.The wine selection to compliment is also very good with some well priced bargains too.You won't be disappointed, whether you're going with friends, business or for a romantic night you will have great experience
5
One friend advise me to try this restaurant few months ago and so we did and since then we are returning twice a month at least. The food is so good and the chef always try to surprise us with wonderful specialities (warm vacherin Mont d'Or, frog legs a la francaise, choucroute, fish au gros sel...) So not only the food is good but service as well. Would definetly recommend this restaurant
5
only 3 month old, and it is full. every ingredient of a successufll receipie , they got it right. And i am not talking only about the food. From the arrival greetings, to the farewell, and the food recommendation, service and attention to details , it is a awsome experience. they got everything right.The decor, with some semi private areas, paintings and lighting accent pieces. Not over the top to intimidate you. it is great to look at the chefs busy in the open kitchen. The owner-Chef Stefan, goes from table to table , recommending dishes like reciting poetry. The Host Cory, is ever present with her charming attitude.Oh i forgot , yes they serve food. One of the best ever i had for a long time in Singapore.. Receipie are classic still modern, and creative. each taste is subtle and compliment the ingredients. So glad to have discover it . a new star is born
3
I lunched here during the October restaurant. Hit: Is a very convenient location and easy parking at the Amara hotel. Service was fast and attentive. Missed: Food was really quire average, one of the main we tried was the beef and was pretty tough. There is one part of the seating was on a lower level which gave a sunken feeling
5
My brother & i always order the octopus salad and its amazingly tasty,the salad component is refreshing & i loved the dressing to much.very busy & crowded bar & really enjoy the music & place.this is one of my favorite place to hang out....will came back soon..
5
Absolutely outstandingIt has been a long time for the food to dominate the dinner conversation for me but it did last night. Blown away by every component complimented even further by outstanding service. To Stephane and Kori, thank you, Singapore needed this. MUST TRY the salt crusted whole baked fish, unbelievable!!!!
4
I have been to Bar-Roque Grill 3 times now & loved it all 3 times. There's a good vibe to the restaurant - nicely buzzing with great service, thanks to Stephan and Cory. My advise is that you go in a bigger group (5-6) and leave the menu to Stephan, that way you can order the sharing platters. The Kitchen normally stocks a secret stash of seafood, always ocean fresh, and like what the chef always says, in his french accent: "when it came this morning, it was still jumping". The seafood platter is a must try! After your dinner, spend some time at the terrace/bar, and finish the night with a nice Armagnac
5
Ive been to this restaurant 3 times and all have been good. The place has a lively and casual vibe with an interesting decor. Service is good and manager Kori brings a touch of glamor to the place. Chef Stephane is from alsace, so his tarte flambe , a pizza like dish is a must.The rotisserie chicken is definitely one of the best in Singapore, if not the best. Watch out for the specials - those are the most interesting - a 1 kg prime rib special once was spectacular, as was the salt crust fish which was totally delicious. A restaurant that one can go back regularly without being bored
