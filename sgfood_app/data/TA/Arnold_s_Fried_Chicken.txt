Definately one of my most fav fried chicken. Prefer the kampung chicken rather than the cut pieces ones.

This is one of the best chicken I would prefer than the rest. The chicken is crispy and the portion is just right. There is only 2 outlet in Singapore

Value for money, hot, juicy, tasty chicken. What more can I say. Best fried chicken fast food in town. Do avoid peak hours as it tend to be very crowded!

One of the best places for fried chicken! Always served piping hot and freshly fried! Chicken is tasty and meat is tender. Can be a little too oily, but hey it's fried chicken. Criss-cut fries is a good side to order.

I frequented their first outlet in City Plaza and now I go to the one at Hougang Green. There is usually a waiting time but it's still manageable. The fried chicken is always served piping hot (and I love that), and the skin is always crispy (because it's still piping hot), the meat is tender and still juicy. It's delicious! The criss cut fries are good too!

The food was absolutely delicious, all the staff friendly and the ambience was relaxing and perfect. You all worked so hard to make it all happen so smoothly and I really appeciate all your hard work. It is a day I will remember for a long time. I can't get enough of your food especially the coleslaw, fried chicken and mash potatoes.
