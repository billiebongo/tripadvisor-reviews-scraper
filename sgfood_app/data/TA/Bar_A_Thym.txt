After spending the best part of a year eating in Melbourne's great restaurants, last night was like coming home. Bar-A-Thym might not have Michelin stars, but my meal and the overall friendliness and buzz of Chef Francois' restaurant are really wonderful - every time !!!

I first want to highlight that this review is written for the Christmas take out menu.We’ve been ordering our Christmas dinner from Bar-A-Thym for many years and it is THE dinner that the family looks forward to.We tried the roasted suckling pig this year and it was our favourite - every edible part was consumed! You can see from the picture that the colour was perfect, skin was crispy and meat was tender.The turkey didn’t disappoint - it was sufficiently moist and the stuffing was delicious as it was tasty but not heavy - very well balanced.The roast beef was also amazing.All the above was served with seasonal vegetables that made the meal complete.This is one Xmas tradition I’ll definitely continue for a while.Merry Christmas

I'm disappointed to have to write this review after the 5-star review I gave it on our last visit (see the review below). We came back with two colleagues on a Tuesday night, hoping for another incredible experience. The food was still very, very good. But the experience was ruined by the behavior of a large group at the next table in this tiny restaurant, and the staff's utter unwillingness to do anything about it despite our constant requests. This group of about 10 boisterous young men at the table immediately adjacent to ours was so incredibly loud that we literally could not hear each other. We had to shout to the waiter to be heard. We requested no fewer than three times that the waiter ask the other table to quiet down, and we indicated that we were unable to talk or enjoy ourselves. Th wait staff obviously realized it was a problem but looked helpless, exchanged nervous glances with each other, and said nothing. They obviously just didn't want to lose all the liquor sales going in at that table. After a pleasant first hour with our friends, we ended up spending the rest of our time there visibly frustrated and annoyed. C'mon, Bar-a-Thym, we expected more from you. Not sure we will be back after this experience. We spent far too much on this meal to have it be ruined like this

Food was great! I love the black angus steak and the oysters. Good serving size. Nice ambiance. Chef was awesome and the staff are all friendly and attentive. It was my friend's birthday and they gave here a pretty dessert with a candle. It wasn't on the menu and was told it was the chef's own creation. It was so delicious. Great place to dine and wine.
5
I just loved the open concept of “you give a Budget and the Chef propose you something within this”. We said 100$ per person, and we were not disappointed. It was excellent, we especially loved the mussels. The TBone was great and huge! Wine was good but expensive, as always in Singapore you will tell me ! We will come back ! Merci

I have going since they open their doors 2 years agoeach experience is amazing with Chef Francois cookingthe staff treats me like family makes me feel so good &happening every time. Happy birthday guys & not forgetting our lady pastry chef who makes the heavenly desserts ...

I was looking for a high-quality, intimate, delicious restaurant where my husband and I could take a colleague/friend for dinner. After much searching, I found Bar-A-Thym and I am so grateful for the reviewers who pointed me in this direction. What a terrific meal! We ordered the Omakase menu, putting ourselves in the chef's hands. Each dish--and there were many--was delicious, sort of French-fusion style. After asking our dining group about allergies and preferences, the chef prepared dishes that included (and I am forgetting several of them) extraordinary tuna ceviche, foie gras terrine, angel hair pasta with sea urchin and ebi, cod and potato "croquettes", waygu beef (a large plate of meat--not just a few slices!), and dessert. (Most of these dishes appear to be on the regular menu, too.) We couldn't stop talking about how good the food was! The service was attentive and unobtrusive; the chef came out to talk with us; and the restaurant was small and quiet, yet still casual. It worked out to about S$100 pp, which we thought was a bargain. The wine was extremely expensive, though. We would go back again in a heartbeat
5
The beauty of Bar-a-thym is the feeling of belonging. A small, cosy set up feels super familiar and personable especially when the chef comes to talk to you, making sure everything is going as well as possible. My second time here, as was back for the omakase experience. Decided to come back after my first was just for drinks and the staff offered cold cuts and bread despite the kitchen being closed, showing absolute full service that many lack. Of course, the food is awesome. Being brave and leaving it to the chef's tastes isn't for the faint hearted but am glad I did it. I even left the choice of wine to the chef, showing my absolute confidence in this bistro's quality. Have already arranged for my 3rd visit. :)

Our 2nd visit, this time to celebrate our friend's birthday. Thoroughly enjoyed our meal there, the food was great , as usual, and ingredients fresh! The iberico pork Jowl was a favourite, angel hair pasta with Hokkaido sea urchin a must order. We had the Omakase , so we also got to enjoy the seasonal produce which are normally not in the main menu. Topped off the dinner with a desert platter and wine. Nice place to just chill with some wine and good company. The staff are personable and friendly, and it's nice to see Chef Francois chatting up with the restaurant guests when he is not too busy. Certainly will be heading down to Bar-a-Thym again.

Had the set lunch recently, and enjoyed both the starter and the main course, but desert was ok at best - the Paris-brest, which was slightly overdone IMO. However the tomato and mozzarella starter was very tasty and the lamb main course was also very good. For a $38++ set lunch, it was good value and probably worth another visit. Although not busy, the staff were distracted at times and we had to wait to place our initial order, despite being one of only a few tables in the restaurant
5
Modern french cuisine at its best. Chef François Mermilliod knows what he's doing, just ask him to prepare the menu for you 3 or 4 courses, you're in safe hands and it will not hurt your wallet! Wines are very reasonable priced.

Good friendly bar, staff great, good selection of both food and drink, excellent place to while away the time.

A small restaurant in Club Street, it may not look like much but don't be fooled. Owned and run by Chef Francois, I've eaten there quite a few times and I've never been let down.Last night my husband took me there for dinner - the first time we've out on a Friday night in years so this was the perfect choice as we are both mad foodies.The food was utterly delicious and cooked to perfection. We had salmon with shaved fennel, Irish oysters, white French asparagus with pork jowl, mussels in a tomato broth (OMG), and grass fed beef. We skipped dessert as there was simply no more space. I do hate to gush, but every course was amazing. The mussels are seasonal French ones and were so luscious I plan to go back for them. So if you want a great, tasty night out, you can't go wrong with Bar-A-Thym
5
How would I describe this place if I had one word? Fusion (no, not French). Two words? French Fusion (yes, this is where French comes in). Three words? French Fusion & Francois. No, they don't make a sentence, but they aptly describe Bar a Thym in my opinion. The food is yummylicious, sporting a good balance of French flavors and Asian touch. Omakaze paves way for a procession of tasty and gorgeously plated dishes (albeit French sized serving), whose names are a distant memory now, but whose wonderful flavors linger on. Definitely recommend visiting for French Fusion cuisine in the Lion City. And if you're lucky to chance upon the Chef in a good mood, he can be pretty entertaining and fun :
5
Back again at Bar-A-Thyme after 9 months and consistency is it's middle name. We had a group of 5 this time and we threw Chef Francois a challenge. Order for us and surprise us with the menu and true enough we were fed extremely well. We had slow cooked pork cheeks which were incredibly tender & succulent. We were told it's been slow cooked for more than 20 hrs. We also had Corsica prawns which were lusciously sweet. Next came the Dover Sole which was cooked to perfectly. We had bouillabaisse which was thick & flavoursome before dessert. Having a great experience at a restaurant once is a wonderful experience but when it's consistent you know the establishment got the algorithm right

Fine, innovative French cuisine in a relaxed atmosphere. Chef Francois Mermilliod, concocted a special Omakase menu for our wedding anniversary.Ceviche of Yellow Fin Tuna, Yuzu-Ponzu Dressing, Apple-Fennel Salad, Black CrackerAngel Hair Pasta,Scallops, Sakura Ebi and Lemon...beaucoup de fromages.The Moret Saint Denis wine was exceptional. A fantastic place for romantic dinner or evening with friends. Enjoy!

My extended week in Singapore and then Bangkok meant I was by myself foer a Valentine's dinner.Thus what else is a globetrotter to do but to find a suitable French restaurant and enjoy the convivial atmosphere (even if most couples are looking riomatic and holding hands).I picked a gem of a restaurant in Bar-A-Thym.The atmosphere was very Gallic.The service was excellent even for a lonely traveler.The food was delightful.The charcuterie platter was delicious with the crusty homemade bread a sensation.The robust yet elegant Burgundy was delightful.The Mille Feuille was wonderful.Tres Bon
5
Was looking for a romantic place to bring my date and Bar A Thym is just the Purrrrfect Place! The food is amazinggg , all the staff were very friendly and i loved the part where the chef comes out and speaks with each guest about the dinner :) We will definately be back again :)

No "baratin": this is a hidden jewel. In the unassuming setting of a small shop house, enjoy one of Singapore's most authentic and carefully prepared French cuisines. The ingredients are faultless, not only in freshness, but most importantly in origin: farmed fish and sea food are banned, meats have the flavor and texture that only the most carefully selected producers can provide. The cuisine is in-between refined family cooking and fine cuisine, i.e. flavorful and never pretentious, but also original, discreetly sophisticated, light, and colorful. The service is as professional as it is friendly. The desserts are completely consistent with the other dishes (try the choux buns). So is the carefully established wine list. And the prices are a real good surprise: one wonders how Chef François manages to offer us such quality meals with such modest bills. The set lunch at $38 can be a daily treat, for your palate and your wallet

Upon arrival, we were shown promptly to our table towards the back of the restaurant. Two guests sitting at the next table chose to move to the front room as they felt it was too cold. The staff was proactive and offered to serve us warm water while we perused the 3-course business lunch menu.My friend's appetizer of ceviche of yellow fin tuna with yuzu was fresh, tender and moist, the yuzu added a zing to the dish. She especially liked the Japanese element in the dish. My starter of charcuterie board of home made pâté and terrine with mesclun salad was typical French fare. When we were served complimentary bread, we two ladies initially didn't want to try it, thinking it would fill us up and we would not have room for the 3-course meal. But after one bite of the French rustic bread with a soft centre and a nice crispy crust, we couldn't help ourselves and finished all the delicious bread. Both our main course of lamb chops and duck confit were executed well, the lamb chops cooked just right medium rare while the duck had a nice crispy skin but was tender and flavourful, although a wee bit salty.The slight disappointment was the dessert of vanilla ice cream with mixed berries compote and meringue. We were expecting toasted meringue curls instead of strips of meringue. It was nice of Chef Francois to come out from the open kitchen to chat with the remaining diners after the lunch crowd had left.Cost of two business lunch came to under S$90 ($38++ excluding drinks), slightly more expensive than some restaurants offering similar deals. However it still represents good value for a decent meal with good service in the CBD area

We went there for dinner last Friday and it was a good surprise.
Very tasty food and an excellent service, reliable, discrete and efficient.
.
Congratulations to this team
We really enjoy it
We strongly recommend
Keep going guys !!!

Very good service to compliment excellent food. Good cellar and BYO made this an inspired luncheon venue. Private area offers more intimacy for enjoying chefs recommendations leisurely
5
Chef Francois is constantly delighting us with great products and perfect cooking. It doesn't hurt that the staff is friendly and knowledgeableAll of it for a reasonable price (including wine) so we end up coming back oftenCan't wait for mussels to be back (I usually don't like it but this is really an exception

Decided to try out Bar-A-Thym after having been many times at their neigbour's place Luke's in Gemmill Ln. Set business lunch for 38++ and add a coffee, which makes it to around 50/person. The choice is good, if I remember correctly each time between four to five choices for starter, main, dessert. As a starter I took the home-made pâté which was good but certainly not exceptional. Next time I would try something different. My friend had the salmon which was better. Main was fish and that tasted really good, be it not a very big portion. It might have been just a little bit bigger, also the vegies portion was rather small. Dessert was pain perdu and chocolat and this was probably the best part of the meal. The pain perdu was amazing. They don't serve soft drinks, just some limonata but unfortunately they didn't even have that one on the day I visited. So it was basically water or wine which is a bit sad. If you have to work in the afternoon like regular people, then wine is not really a lunch option. The service was OK and could have been a bit better as well. But still, this looks like a nice place with good potential and overall I still give it a three out of five. The food gets a four
5
After having drinks at the bar once, I finally got a chance to go back and have a full meal here and I wasn't disappointed. The foie gras terrine was amazing and my fish was perfect. The Chef has a few French classics along with a few extra things like ceviche. The potato gratin alone is worth returning for. I can't wait to go back and try a few more items off the menu. In fact, it's been a Long time since I felt this type of urge to go back to a restaurant in Singapore so soon.
5
We had a reservation at a very late time at 11pm on a Thursday night, this restaurant still accomodate us and even served us patè's, wine and mains. The waiters and their chef are so nice. The ambiance is relaxing as well. And their food was great
5
Hosted a birthday celebration here for 11 people and decided to go for the Omakase menu. Food was interesting and tasty. My friends really enjoyed themselves. The Chef was also very engaging and friendly and answered our questions about the food... I did note there wasn't dessert included but well that was fine since we had brought a birthday cake.
5
This charming little French restaurant features your classic French standards with seasonal items. We were all discussing how consistent the food was. Lovely atmosphere and not too noisy with very attentive staff. We loved our meals, beautiful balance of flavours and great presentation.Excellent and not to be missed
5
Chef Francois and team never fail to impress with their consistently high standards for both food and service. On this occasion, like most, we left our meal decisions in the hands of Chef Francois after deciding how many courses we would require......he and the team did not let us down. Starting with a stunning charcuterie plate, we moved to a palate cleansing tuna ceviche, followed by plump and delicate Brittany mussels, a perfectly cooked bone-in John Dory (my personal dish of the night) and finishing with a roasted saddle of wild boar! All beautifully plated, cooked to perfection and absolutely delicious. Highly recommended
5
Had a 10 guests reservation at Bar-A-Thym. They were able to specially cater a special menu just for us paring with wines. There was a lot of food including mussels from France which was an incredible delight. The mussels were smaller than what I am used to but they have an intense flavour. We had a birthday girl and Bar-A-Thym was kind enough to bake a small beautiful cake. Overall an incredible experience again

This is where I tend to bring visitors from out of town or business associates.
Fresh, creative dishes prepared with care.
Sit down and say "feed me chef" you will not be disappointed.
5
Fantastic food. We can taste France at each dish. The chef is really jovial and amazing.
All dishes remind us memories of France...
5
We had the Omakase or degustation where the Chef decides what to serve Us. He asked us what we do not eat n work around that. First we were served some croquette with salted cod and rillete. The butter and bread was great.Fresh oysters with some ponzu was served next. Then we had some fabulous grilled octopus and heirloom tomatoes.Lobsters in rice paper rolls followed by delicious mussels from Brittany. The pork jowls were Super yummy too. But the best I would say it's the stuffed quail. It was fabulous! Still moist yet yummy. We had some avocado ice cream n choc desserts which was refreshing. The whole meal was amazing.
5
Chef Francois is a very talented chef. This is simply fabulous food. He cooks seasonal food omakase and it is wonderful. He has great range and versatility but the best of modern French food shines through in every dish.The unpretentious and relaxed environment and service matches the dishes that simply let the quality ingredients shine. Wine list that covers all the bases needed.Give yourself a treat and visit Bar-a-Thym
5
This is a good place for a business lunch. Very attentive staff and good food. The set lunch is not set in stone and offers enough choice. Plates were served with the right interval, so no time lost. The decor is simple but high quality. Decent prices
5
No Michelin stars but Bar-A-Thym is always on my short list. Lunch or dinner, business or pleasure - it never disappoints. In pleasant surroundings, Chef Francois and his team consistently serve up tasty seasonal food that is sophisticated without ever being stuffy or pretentious. The wine list is short but clever - covering all the bases with good quality wines at sensible prices. My tip - trust the chef and go for the Omakase. You won't be disappointed

Our large group occupied the long table with high stools near the bar area which was semi al fresco. The air conditioning was really helpful as it was quite hot outside. A nice touch to have a feel that your outdoors but still not suffering from the very humid temperature. We decided to order food to share with all so that each one can at least taste and try. So far none of us had any negative comments on the food. 4 bottles of white wine also helped in making that dinner and night memorable

This restaurant was highly recommended by a friend. The food was good and refined ; the service was attentive. But I personally prefer a roomier set-up as space was tight between tables . There are too many alternatives in this vicinity ..I may try others before I return .
5
What a genius Chef! Chef Francois offers Omakase Menu by season. He can prepared food according to guest's preferences. Me and my husband really enjoy the wagyu beef with white asparagus, It's really tender and good quality meat. I'm actually pregnant and Chef Francois prepared an organic and healthy food for me. I also like the organic strawberries financier dessert from France, melts in my mouth! Ambience is perfect for us! Attentive and very efficient service. We will comeback for sure!
5
Superb, superb, superb!! When we arrived we were made to feel very welcome, always a good start to a night out! The foie gras terrine was to die for, the tomato tart tatin just delicious. Then to the mains. The Wagyu was cooked to perfection, the accompanying epoisse gratin superb. The organic chicken breast, just beautiful. Our fourth diner had the special of the day, veal sweetbreads, also magnifique! Our dessert was also to die for.........

Excellent choice for a working lunch. Quiet enough ambience to have a good discussion. Attentive and prompt service. Good, value for money, 3-course set lunch. Excellent food; good selection and portion sizes, well seasoned. Will definitely come again.
5
My friends and I are regulars at Francois's art deco restaurant. His impeccable personality and culinary skilled surpasses no one. Delicious food and consistently beyond expectation with 1st class service by his team.
Bar A Thym is our number one choice always :) :)
5
Really great food - neither too light nor too heavy, neither too sophisticated nor too simple, and always visually appealing and very tasty - a perennial favourite. Place your faith in Chef Francois and go for the Omakase. You won't be disappointed.

Set in a casual dining atmosphere, bar a thym brings good food in a relaxed setting.it was our first time there, and we ordered the Omakase style dinner. All the dishes were well prepared and tasty, the Char siew in particular was unforgettable. The chef is friendly and chatty, and the waiters were well trained and attentive.I will recommend it to people who wants to enjoy good food in a relaxed environment, and enjoy good value for it too
5
Francois is one of the most talented French Chef in Singapore. Every of his dish is done to perfection and they are simply unmatched. Very glad that he came back to the restaurant scene again and so we can taste great French food without breaking the bank!

It's not your usual mediterranean. With a French Kiss,Spanish flare, Thai-d-ness and exotic japanese seafood, your tongue will be entangled in exciting flavours, and yet it's gentle on your palate. They seem to dance in your mouth as you taste each bite of the appetisers served before you. We had the omakase style, which Francois Mermilliod prepared delicate sharing portions which allowed us gals to enjoy with our drinks. The Iberico ham was my favourite as it melts in my mouth over and over again. Cute little Pergola Sardas, like pearls of the sea, doing a salsa with his squid and home made Chorizo. The Bacalao Accras, Nahm Jhim Dressing are fish balls in thai chilli sase. Some names on the menu are unrecognisable, but really, who cares when it's omakase. Just let him take care of you. For a table of chatty gals having a great night out, and with great wine, we didn't spend more than we would have in a porch restaurant and gotten so much more value and fun for the night!! And we didn't forget the dessert!Definitely a great place for lunch and dinner anytime. Not forgetting that their seafood is sustainable as much as they can, which I eat with pleasure and guilt free
5
As always, Francois and his amazing team never disappoint us:) Enjoyable and refined cuisine with impeccable service:)One of Singapore's highly acclaimed restaurants, Bar-a-Thym (aka Sweet Talkin') exudes a "homelier" ambience. Contemporary French creations (with Asian ingredients) are superb and audacious:) Definitely our fave resto and no doubt coming back for more! merci beaucoup Francois :
5
 Real good traditional bistro fare revisited. I had a bouillabaisse using a mixture of more locally available and perhaps some more obscure Mediterranean rock fish. Really good. Good dessert chef. I had a "black is back" dessert, lots of dark chocolate and strawberries. In sum - good flavors, creative and not trying too hard.We had a table at the end of the restaurant and somehow the aircon is not working as well as it should be. They brought out a fan and that helps. But they should work on a more permanent solution.Good resto, and I will come back, but I will choose the tables towards the front of the restaurant. ;

We didn't realise this was the restaurant's first Saturday opening for brunch.The dishes on the brunch menu are mostly designed to be shared. After a quick chat with the Chef, we ordered the two signature dishes - char siew (melt in your mouth roast pork served with pear chutney, toasted hazelnuts and pea tendrils) and sotong - char grilled squid with fragola beans and chorizo. Both dishes were well executed and delicious. Our meal was served with a basket of fresh warm bread and a side of butter. Everything washed down with a glass each of fragrant rosÃ© made for a lovely weekend meal. We couldn't resist an order of French toast and coffee to finish.

I have been to Bar-a-Thym a couple of times now, once for a glass of wine and a couple of small sharing plates, and then on the strength of that for our office Christmas lunch, for 10 people. On both occasions the food was some of the best I have had in Singapore, both inventive in its fusion of French and Asian influences and just delicious. There wasn't a single discordant note in the menu that Francois put together for us, and it was frankly stunning value at SGD50 a head for 4 courses. I did feel that the staff were struggling slightly to get 10 plates up at the same time for each course, so there were some long pauses, but they were friendly and helpful throughout, so it didn't really bother me. So in summary, wonderful - I just wish it was closer to our office
