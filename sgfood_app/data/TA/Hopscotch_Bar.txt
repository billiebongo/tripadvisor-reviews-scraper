Disclaimer: We used the one-for-one deals on Entertainer app. Without it, the prices are still quite reasonable :) Service was pretty good, they took the initiative to refill the snacks and water without our prompting. Needed prompting to get glasses when someone arrives late though.

Came here recently for a few cocktails. Good selection of interesting cocktails with a local theme and really quite impressive presentation. Bespoke cocktails also possible. Worth another visit.

I came here in April 2017 but only remembered to write a review of this place now. Unfortunately, they closed end April due to the closure of Red Dot Traffic Building but I heard they were looking to open again soon.The menu was a Best Of from their previous few menus. It even featured one from their sister bar, Mars Bar due to popular demand. I especially loved the Mad Men Long Island Tea.The impressive part isn't the menu but the hospitality, service and bespoke cocktails. The team there are such a fun bunch, always making merry and involving us. Definitely try their bespoke, tell them something you like and they will craft something up for you. I had this amazing Grapefruit Rose drink which they came up with on the spot. Also ask them if they have any specials as sometimes they were experimenting with some ingredients like dry ice and nitrogen

Found this place while walking back to our hotel, was one of the best cocktails i have tried and the presentation was amazing, when you get the drink they give you a full explanation about the drink. I would not only recommend this place i would tell people that you have to go here and get a drink. P.S the little bowl of chilli crisps that they they give you on the side are also really tasty

I have been to many cocktail bars but this is one of my favourite. The bartenders are friendly and creative. The latest addition is the Bangkok twist which comprise of light rum and mango juice but what I like about this drink is it has the the taste of Thai tea and it come with the lychee burst. The other drink I tried is the Long Island tea, extremely potent. It is smooth but strong. If you can't find anything from the menu, the friendly bartender can help you to customize your drink. Joe, the mixologist is extremely creative and never fail to make a perfect cocktail for me.

We found Hopscotch via an article about forward thinking drink makers in Singapore. This place takes the cake! We even went back for Happy Hour the next day just so we could try additional drinks (Cocktails are $15 for Happy Hour!) Elijah was fantastic at explaining all of the thought process that went into each drink - and how you will experience each drink with multiple senses not just taste. Each drink is visually stimulating, creates a aromatic experience and have complex tastes. We were able to visit with Joel as well - and learn more about the inspirations for his recipes! You cannot come to Singapore and want cocktails and not check out Hopscotch

This is a rather informal cocktail bar run by a few local youngsters. It is possible to drink in the courtyard too.The drink menu is organised into four "chapters". There are bar food, beer as well as wine.For each drink there is guidance on sweetness, sourness, strength and astringency.Cocktails range from $20-25.Well worth repeat visits

I'm forever indebted to my friend for introducing me to this bar! Since she brought me here, we've been back several times, and it has never disappointed. It's clear that the bartenders working here love their work and are passionate about creating good cocktails, because you can taste it in the drinks. The selling point here at Hops is that the cocktails are designed with the locals in mind, and each has its own Asian twist. The cocktail choices are so varied that whatever your mood or fancy, you'll definitely find a drink to match; and if you can't be bothered going through the menu, just tell the bartender what you're in the mood for and voila, in no time you'll have the perfect cocktail. You can also order food which will be delivered to the bar in a flash, if you're peckish. Clearly people know what a great time they can have at Hops, because it's packed to the rafters on Friday and Saturday nights. Go early, grab a seat at the bar, sit back, and enjoy!

The drinks here are very unique, it's like an experience in itself. Definitely one of my Favourite bars in sg. Chinese food and snacks like fries and nuggets are available via a neighbouring restaurant. Highly recommend this place!

The coffee is great especially the Hazelnut Latte is a must have. The building used to housed the Singapore Traffic Police unit is converted for F&B and an art gallery. Nice place to chillax.

Knowledgeable Bartenders, Check. Great ingredients, Check. Artfully and Cheekily designed menu, Check. Ive been to some of the best cocktail barks in New York, LA, the Bay Area, Tokyo, and Hong Kong and in terms of taste, presentation and creativity, this takes the cake.

First time I came here, it was for an event & they served their cocktails in plastic cups. So much for the great presentation I was looking for.Decided to give Hopscotch a 2nd chance & I didn't regret it. My friends & I had a great time here. There are table games to play, the bar snacks are so addictive (haha), & the cocktails are delicious & innovative. Service was good as well; when our drinks were served, along came an explanation of what we were drinking. We came during happy hour & some side ingredients weren't available for the cocktails (e.g. grass jelly/dry ice), so that was the only bummer.Hopscotch will be relocating to a new location at the end of the year; I will be sure to patronize them again

Lovely ambience at the bar. When I arrived, the bartenders as well as servers brought me in and attended to me to the upmost fine detail. I thoroughly enjoyed their recommendations of the Long Island Iced Tea. They make beautiful bespoke drinks as well, even with local tastes such as bandung and chicken soup. A very interesting concept for a beautiful bar. Greatly recommend everyone to come

Love the amazing concoctions here, made better with 1 for 1 from 5 to 8pm daily! The amount of effort they put into the creation of each drink is remarkable. Never been disappointed a single time and will definitely return to concue everything on their menu

Was here for the. National Day specials. To be completely honest, I didn't expect the cocktails to be served in plastic cups. If I'd known, I probably would've made plans elsewhere..... & they got one of our orders of shots wrong. I did, however, like their music selection

Been to 4 or 5 of the cocktail bars in Singapore, and yes they honestly are all are very good! But, this place has the best. By best I mean, cocktails that are not just cool and creative, but somehow match the palate so so well it's as if they researched the taste buds of most humans and designed cocktails to not only make the person happy, but also make the person think 'wow that's different and delicious!!!' If you are picky as hell like me, go here. The cocktails are superb

Ended up here by accident - meant to go to the Red Dot Museum but they were closed for a private event. The bartender was a hoot and super quirky. Their menu of cocktails is a comic book! Sadly only discovered this two drinks into the night, but I had to order off this menu, right? So I did! Some of the techniques are very cool in how they make the cocktails, for example, by smoking the cinnamon stick to give it a different essence altogether. The live musician was hilarious and played all these super poppy tunes but also totally made fun of herself doing that. Had such a good time, the bartender gave us free shots at the end as a thanks :) Love this place - going back again
