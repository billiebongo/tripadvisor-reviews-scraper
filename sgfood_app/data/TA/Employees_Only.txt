Great service, awesome atmosphere and vibe. Met the manager and asked him what makes this space so unique...answer? Experience, service...He convinced me

Thanks Michael for the attention!

What a joke you guys kidding? $32 for espresso martini.. very disappointed rude and nasty bartender.. on friends recommendation went there but so cheap service. Hello guys you forgot your root and concept wake up.. damm you guys sucks.

I ordered a G&T - pretty average, no attempt at nice presentation. Just gin tonic and ice in a regular glass. Expensive too. Nothing wrong with it but not worth a special visit.
4
A great bar for weekdays or weekend in Singapore. Cool atmosphere, great music, awesome service from the baristas and a new york edge. Always on the list when visiting Singapore.

I heard so much about this place and hence planned a weekend outing with my partner there on Friday night. Extremely sad place, so tiny & cramped up. Dont get me wrong, size is not a concern but the layout etc should still not feel very tight than comfortable. Food was very average. They didnt have their special Oysters available (OOS) so we ordered the special- King Prawns with vinegerete sauce and asparagus & some greens on the side. When the dish arrived, it was missing asparagus and prawns were bland. Ordered grilled cheese- the worst I ever had. and Fries with it were so tiny & oily- BAD is the word.We ordered a bottle of champagne and that was my only salvation for an otherwise waste of time.Servers were cool & friendly and that was a plus too!!!Still cant put a pin on why this place is popular around here or may be it was my source that suggested it! Who knows, never going back but

It was a let down on the food. The food menu was limited to begin with. And then to find out they had run out of the ribeye. The pork loins which we ordered in its place was a thick slab of tough and not too flavorful meat. The wine wasn’t cheap too. We didn’t try any of the cocktails thoug

Started at the bar, it was a true pleasure to watch an artist behind the bar. No there was not a painter but the Bar tender was at that caliber. I have spent time bar tending, this guy was amazing and created some of the best cocktails and was as engaging with the customers.the vibe in the place was welcoming and the other patrons were all in a great mood and easy to talk to.Every dish we had was better than the last. I could tell the chef and the cooks took care of every detail during the preparation of the food.Highly recommend getting a reservation the place is packed nightly... it is that popular

We tried this venue out on recommendations of a friend who was in town from HK. Initially it was a little hard to locate the entrance (unless you know what you are looking for). We had drinks at the bar before dinner (great list of GINS to choose from). We were there on a Wednesday night and it was very busy with the after work crowd. From my experience would strongly recommend you book a table in advance if you are looking to eat there. The bar are itself got very busy. We had several starters to share between us.I had the chicken which absolutely fantastic tender and juicy. One of the best i had in ages. We had several side dishes as well. Service was excellent. My only negative point on the venue was the bar area was so loud with everyone talking it was quite difficult to hear yourself talk at the table so if its a romantic quiet evening your looking for not sure its the right place... Other than that it had a great vibe
1
Due to the place being over crowded my friend didnt realize he was blocking the back entrance to the bar. The employee came along and just pushed him to get access. My friend refused to move but his reply was- you want to stay, stay otherwise leave, this is how it is here. All my friend asked him for after that was an apology to which he refused. We ultimately left when his senior intervened and asked us to move.NEVER GOING THERE AGAI

We had some drinks in this cozy bar. Lovely atmosphere, great music and superb service but a quite expensive place, 3 GT (Monkey 47) 99 SGD.
3
Great drinks list and lovely ambience, but it can get very crowded, so go early in the week unless you want to stand and be squashed.
4
This is a tiny ground floor bar in the old part of Singapore with a great vibe and playing 80s rock style music - we were in a group of 9, service was great and we had a ball!!
4
The oysters and Steak tartar was excellent start of the meal. But the main course was just ok. They need to work on the pork chop. Otherwise, it is a fun place for a Friday night out. Great drink menu of course.
3
Difficult to chat during dinner. basically all the people talk extremely loud here ....lol ...limited parking along the street so better come early to chop the parking lot
5
Met up with friends at this cooll spot. Amazing cocktails and very unique decore. The crowd was mixed and all having a great time. They have a very extensive cocktail list and if it's something special you want I'm sure they can make it.
4
Enjoyed going here only tried the drinks but staff lovely and friendly. Would def go back. Music really good and makes everyone in a happy mood. For someone that has never been to Singapore this is somewhere I would def recommend or come again for drinks. Staff so helpful and approachable. Nice when you are away from home. Thanks will come again if I can
5
Took a business partner for drinks and dinner. Got in early when they opened, prior to the dinner reservation, so the place was not crowded at all. Had to ask where to find the entrance, which makes sense since it has a speakeasy vibe. Small, cozy and fancy place, and enjoyed the bar and special cocktails recommended by the bartender. Did not eat anything, so can't comment on food, but I am sure it is good. Heard that it got crowded and loud here during peak hours, so glad we went when we did, so we could have a decent business conversation
2
I go to EO often as theres always a good crowd, and though the cocktails are little expensive, they make up for it by making them nice and strong. 6 of us went into EO on Saturday night, so we decided to buy a bottle of vodka as its a lot more economical (or at least we thought). We were shocked when the bill came and they wanted to charge us $700 for 1 bottle of 750ml vodka. Will be a while before I go back
5
Visited here on Monday night following the F1 GP. We had already been to the New York site & loved it so took the opportunity whilst in Singapore to pay a visit.Equally amazing cocktails (if not better) created by the 'old boys'. Michael is a master of his trade & was an amazing host.We also had dinner, a mixture of small & big plate dishes, equally good but this place is all about the cocktails. It's not cheap but neither should it be given that these guys really know what they are doing. Try the Ginger Smash, I had five & was equally smashed afterwards!!
5
Ex-pat hang out area. Small and crowded bar but worth it. Good drinks. Do not do come in casual attire (no sneakers or shorts). Good diversity of crowd. Highly recommend.
3
Not the best place to visit on this street. It's ok for drinks but there's not too much choice of food. We had one drink and left so we can't comment on quality of food but it seemed pricy.
5
Great service, great menu, sublime cocktails from knowledgeable NY mixologists. Best of Luck in Hong Kong
4
This first outpost of the hugely famous New York Cocktail sensation did not disappoint. The bar-tending was masterful and entertaining. Cocktail making was turned into a bespoke and social craft. Great vibes! Credit to all the well polished servers who were always cheerful and charmingly engaging. We tried some of the food including the signature bone marrow poppers. It was good but not a Wow. The crowd was buzzing mainly a mixture working executives and merry goers. This is not a cheap place but I guess we are paying for its branding and the buzzy NYC vibes.
3
Was great earlier in the evening but when the crowd got bigger it was havoc. The drinks are good, service very obliging....but when you can't walk through the place and there are long lines for the bathroom I lose interest. I was also disappointed with the bone marrow poppers - average. Go elsewhere if crowds are not your thing
5
Blown away by the food, drinks, service and good vibes! Didn't expect much from the food considering that EO's a bar but wow. Everything was yummy, even when we had complicated orders I.e, can't take anything that contains butter and milk. Thank you for the attention to details!
4
Great food, delicious cocktails and attentive service.Had a great time. The only downside is that tables were just a tad too close to each other and the noise level made it such that you had to shout right through dinner. Therefore not a place to linger for conversation despite the delicious cocktails
4
I was here one evening for some cocktail... it was a pretty crazy night, but what I remember without any doubt was the very high quality of the cocktails prepared for me by Jia Wei (thanks again!).I personally think that I had had here some of the best cocktails I ever tried, and so the place is an "ABSOLUTELY SUGGESTED" but... let me stress our two caveat:1) this is probably the most expensive place I visited in Singapore (around 30S$ per cocktail as a final price)2) the place is quite noisy, especially in the weekend, so if you want to have a decent conversation I would not choose this place, but one of the many others in the area (search between my other review if you want!)Nevertheless a place to be visited 
5
Recommended my friends to this restaurant as I had thoroughly enjoyed the bone marrow poppers and the prime ribeye during my previous visit. Happy to say the standards remained. Hand cut steak tar tar and oysters were yummlicious too! Cocktails were great as well. Just not wowed over with the desserts.Place is small (just a few tables) and can get noisy as half the restaurant is taken up by a bar counter/bar stools.
5
If you have been to New York and visited the EO there, you know what to expect: a perfect american bar with bar classics, infused boze and some dining.This bar is a copy of the original, including the "psyche" sign in the entreance window and the "beware..." over the bar. No experiments.While the bar is slioghtly smalle than the original, the drinks are the same. Jalapeno infised chartreuse and other self made ingredients are also availiable there as their well known food. If you want to be on the safe side when getting a drink, you will be fine here, if you want some more local style, you need to go elsewhere.Slightly more expensive thant the other SG bars
5
there's several of these bars in the world, Manhatten and Hong Kong . great cocktails and fun for dinner too
5
I went to Employees only with a friend for a drink and had really a good time. Great decor, nice people, and drinks exceptionally good. The staff was nice and very quick.
4
visited here with some work friends recently and enjoyed a vast array of different cocktails, ended up moving on to eat food there too, good selection of small eats which we shared. great atmosphere and a lovely evening. worth a visit.
4
A more or less new place. Good Cocktails and a variety of whiskey's to try. The People behind the bar are friendly and helpful. Not so big and maybe a bit loud as the evening ends...😉
5
The nr 1 place to go if you want a fun night out with friends. Great food and drinks and you always end up dancing the night away.
4
Cosy bar with great cocktails, very punchy and strong for cocktails. Out of menu customisation possible too. Food was surprisingly good also, especially the beef tartare and the sausage pasta. Limited bar seats, so be prepared to stand. Good after work drinks spot with working crowd on weekdays.
4
I first visited the eo in Manhattan on a 21st birthday trip and was excited when the bar by the same people openrd up in sg-and was pleasantly surprised that it is much better! The eo in NYC gets crowded and becomes clubby but the one in sg stays classy and quiet. On top of that the drinks are as amazing and creative as always
4
The cocktails were fantastic, as expected. We had little expectations of how the food will be, and we pleasantly surprised to find that the portions and the quality were hearty and good. The steak tartare was came with delicious thin bread chips, and the pork main dish was succulent and delicious. Good ambience overall..
5
It's one of those places where you will enjoy if you want to chat up with those working in CBT of Singapore. Most people come here after work for a catch up drink and dinner. The bar is classy and food is amazing. One of the dishes to surely try is Hand-Cut Steak Tartar with Crostini & Mixed Greens Salad. Only some members at the bar are allowed to make it. But it's not to be missed. The staff is super friendly and chatty. I'm told that this place is owned by some of the best bar guys from the world. So go for this place
5
I had been there for two consecutive nights on a three day trip to Singapore. Perfect little bar for coctail lovers and for those who'd like to meet new people. International crowd, great coctails, friendly staff and a fortune teller right behind the enterance. Very close to Telok Ayer MRT Station. Somewhere I'd love to go back one day
5
Was to good the first night so had to come back :-) no regrets !!! Party starts after 10PM
Yes its a fantastic bar , but they also serve fantastic food , and don't miss the mentalist , you will be blown away .
5
We went for a low-key birthday celebration on a Monday night. Dinner was lovely and I loved the atmosphere of the place.
5
Had amazing time sitting at the bar counter. The bartenders are a fun loving bunch. We only had beer and wines the whole night, will try cocktail next time.
4
The food was delicious, the service very good but the cocktails were very expensive. Nice vibe and cool decor.
2
You know that feeling when you a great night and then at 1:30 one of the staff kick you out in the most rude way? .. evening spoiler. They should train their personal better..
4
Was here for a only a short time - but was super fun - great ambience, well-priced drinks, bar-tenders who know what they're doing. Great place to start a fun evening.
5
Had a fabulous dinner: shared the Steak tartar and salad with brussels sprouts. Then we had the pork chop and skate wing. All cooked and seasoned to perfection. Great drinks to accompany. Owner Eric and his team make it a memorable experience.
5
It's a winner...Tight, warm, classy but in no way up itself.I arrived before the rest of my friends to this tasty little treat, immediately it was clear that the place is very popular. The environment is close, but it's friendly and when I introduced myself to the 'man in the hat', Igor revealed himself as the principal instigator.Personally I really dig nightspots like this, it's on the down-low, but all the details have been carefully put in place, from the soft lighting to the mix of rare groove cuts and Havana street scene hits... This place is on.It took me a few minutes to register that the staff; Igor included, were wearing silk pyjamas...It doesn't matter why, it's was cool, it was fun and it added sweetly to the mood.The night menu got a seeing to, with the Ruben Croquettes and the melted cheese going down super fine, a bottle Mumm to chase it all into place. Conversations were possible, the service staff were happy that we were cheeky but respectful and they did a brilliant job at making us feel comfortable and satisfied.The area around Amoy Street is clearly awash with fine eating venues, but as the night goes on, Employees Only is without doubt the place to keep the feeling alive, if you are yours are feeling up for it or just do not want to go home early.I hope you go and enjoy it as much as I did
5
Having visited it's sister bar in New York, the Singapore chapter is ripped from the same pages. Sharing similar design and many of the same cocktails and menu items, you can't help but get a strong sense of Déjà Vu. The bar staff were super friendly and efficient and the cocktails tasted great, although a little on the pricey side.Definitely a great place for drinks and laughs with a refined and old worldly edge
5
Singapore has an abundance of interesting, different bars popping up all over the city.One famous US outlet that recently opened is Employees Only.The front door is unobtrusive, behind a dark hanging cloth.You pull back the shade and walk in, ears resonating with the cool music, southern blues with a hint of jazz and a full house.I score a single bar seat and watch the fun as the barman mixes a pretty goof Vesper.Great spot to check out the crowds and savour an excellent cocktail
4
Attentive staff, good cocktails, and great music from the mid-90's. Although crowded, the Staff had full Control and were still able to accomodate special drink orders for allergies.
4
If you are looking for a happening place to unwind after work this is the one, great cocktail menu and the place gets nice and busy. Great service, spend some time and just take it all in. Great spot I will be back. Enjoy.
5
Amazing experience at Employees only, I would recommend making a reservation before visiting though, and always always order the cocktails. Some of the best I've had.
3
The overall ambience and service is nice. But I found my cocktail mediocre in both taste and presentation. But in a great neighborhood with many bars around so not bad for a bar hopping night.
5
Love it!!! Plays great music, awesome drinks with working executive crowd. I would rate their whiskey sour Best in Asia. Bartenders are very skilled and make great concoctions. Ask for Omakse and let them Surprise you!! Place is small and hence it is great opportunity to strike a conversation with the person next to you! Crowd is friendly. Average Price of Cocktail is USD20 but you will not be disappointed with the quality. Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys great drinks and music!!
3
The bar indeed looks pretty and ambience is great, but the place is very small. It get pretty packed fast and people will just stand by the bars as there is no place to sit. We came early that day, so we could sit at the bar top. The bartender mixed some drinks and customised it as we ordered, that I thought was cool. At the entrance of the bar, they have some tarot service too going on. My friends like to come here often, as the ambience and cocktails mixing are great, but it's not my favourite place. I don't like being in a small place with lots of people, there are not so much space to move around
5
Was nursing a bad sore throat but still thirsty. Waitstaff was very attentive and immediately asked if I would like a hot alcoholic drink instead. Yeah, of course! So the mixologist made a hot gin with ginger, honey and lemon for me and it was so goood. Love their customizations and care for patrons. Nice music, awesome ambience and this is definitely one of the best bars in Singapore. Must-go every time I am back in Singapore!!
5
Visited with my Wife after a number of recommendations. Cocktails were wonderful best I have had in Singapore.As we were enjoying ourselves so much we stayed for dinner which also exceptionally good. I was pleased to a see a small menu and had the opportunity to talk to the Chef who was not only very knowledgable but obviously passionate. The lamb chops wrapped in bacon sounded a bit experimental but was amazing.The staff were both friendly and professional which turned a good night into a great night
4
I do like the funky entrance making you think it's just a fortune teller. Atmosphere and decor is really nice. The staff are friendly and helpful. Cocktails were expensive (I guess that's Singapore) so I stuck to a glass of prosecco for S$12++. Shared the steak tartare and a small potato dish. Not bad
5
New York in Singapore. Hidden gem (crowd outside always gives it away) on Amoy Street, look out for the fortune teller in the window, speak easy concealed entrance style. Always packed, party atmosphere, incredibly attentive staff, nice touch of chicken soup late into the evening. Also serves food but the cocktail list is what this place is all about
5
A must see.... vibrant little bar. The staff are very helpful and attentive. The drinks they make are fantastic. Certainly worth dropping in for a few very well poured drinks.
4
Drinks are fine. Staff are cheerful. Tarot guy outside is interesting, but not free service. 😁 the ambience is not bad. Quite a lively place.
1
Totally pretentious, you need to be well-dressed on a Friday night. My friends were already inside, but I was taken aback as the bouncer was rude.
5
Thoroughly enjoyed a great evening here.
Steak Tartare was superb
The team were friendly and attentive
Cocktails... well what can u say when they are crates by superb mixologists
Music was excellent
A memorable evening out with friends

First impression, Employees Only is very smart, welcoming and a bit exciting. The two bar men were engaged as soon as we sat down and the drinks that were produced were all great. When one didn't hit the spot they tried to remedy it immediately and when it still wasn't what we were after they quickly offered to cancel it from the bill and proposed something else, it doesn't get much better than that.What let Employees Only down for us was the restaurant and more to the point, our waitress. Our order was taken with nothing being written down and as expected, we were revisited to confirm the order (on two occasions...!) The food was all tasty but overall every dish was pretty bland. The Bone Marrow Poppers and the steak tartare were probably the best dishes that were consumed between the four of us.Nicely designed, they have succeeded in recreating their New York ambiance (although their red diner tables don't quite work with the rest of the interior sadly).The prices for dinner simply aren't justified either in taste or waiting staff and there are far better options in Singapore that command while we will likely return to have a drink next to the great barmen, we will never return for dinner which is a real shame as it could and should have been so good
3
Hey, pretty good vibe. Hip, diverse crowd. The finger foods are innovative & good. Especially liked the bone marrow pastry.The cocktail drinks were different and tasty, and a bit pricey.Good place to meet friends or impress a date. But something was a little off. It felt like the place was "trying too hard" to be like the New York bar. That area on Amoy Street has many cool bars and restaurants. Worth checking out
5
I visited twice over two consecutive nights and was very impressed both nights. Fresh and fast cocktails. No snobby mixology just top quality cocktails. I ate the second night and it was the best pasta I have eaten in Singapore. Will go back again. Topped off by great staff. Well don
5
From the time we arrived.. we were fooled to see the place we were set to go to.. a Pysch in the front window. when we asked where the bar was the lady at the front was seriers and said no bar. we nearly left. then she laughed and said yes go inside.. well done. extremly well done and excellent entr
5
I was drawn to Employees Only by the lively and happening tunes pouring out of the establishment. Going inside, I was greeted by a barmen, who was happy to suggest any one of a number of cocktails but insisted on finding out my likes and dislikes before making them. This was refreshingly not an in and out place, but somewhere you'd love to stay for a few hours to catchup with a friend or meet new people. Everyone was very friendly, the whiskey and cocktail selection was impressive and the ambiance was really cool. I wish we had bars like this in Sydney
4
Cool fun place to grab a beer. Gets pretty packed later on in the evening ! But fun colourful crowd. Easy to miss as no signs . But be aware of a tarot card reader !!!! Give away sign. Whole street is full of fun bars but this is a must on the street
