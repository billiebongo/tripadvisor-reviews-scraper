The range of drinks is quite limited and there was no cheesecake on sale. The place was rather noisy too.
4
Food was good and delicious. Service was good too. A good environment for gathering with friends and family!
5
Vibrant cafe that offer tasty food. Price are also reasonable!
Great place to hang out with you family or friends.
Will go back again!
5
Tried this with my bae, they have best matcha tart and red velvet cake. Best if you can order with coffee. They just have great cakes
5
Im not too into coffee, their coffee was good for me. Pancakes are nice. Nice place overall, regular there
4
The equivalent of a Brownie infusion of lava chocolate with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Not bad indeed.
2
Decent long black, but had the worst pancakes ever..a pity. Pancakes are called Mama’s pancakes, probably mama dun like me, hope she makes it nicer for everyone else.
4
Went there with family for breakfast/brunch as a change from having local food. Not disappointed. Simple industrial chic common with most boutique coffee shop today. The tall long coffee was dark and flavoursome without being too acidic which I hate..We had different breakfasts which was tasty and of good portions..mum had the pulled pork burger which she enjoyed and my wife had the cooked salmon with scrambled eggs which she also enjoyed.Overall, good solid breakfast and coffee. A bit expensive price point wise . A tough competition with other coffee places in a already saturated market

My wife & I visited habitat coffee for Sunday brunch.The location isn't that great but the ambience inside the cafe is good. It has seating at two levels, the upper level seating is a bit crowded tight/but was doable (so far our impression was ok ok)I ordered a lychee infused tea which was nice but the high point were the breakfast/brunch dishes. We went with the servers reco (who was very courteous and polite) with the Big Ben breakfast and the stuffed berries hotcake (15min wait time).The Big Ben breakfast was quite tasty and pretty filling but the hot cakes were the highlight (photo attached), the right amount of berries and syrup with extremely soft pancakes, they were super super delicious (I don't even want to know the calorie count on it :))If you're looking to treat yourself to good (a bit sinful) breakfast would highly recommend to give it a go :
5
The selection of foods here are simply fantastic. We love the Molten Lava Cake, the taste is heavenly and we shall come back another day to try this again with topping of ice cream. Overall, the experience is nice and the choice of foods are great. The restaurant can be quite noisy during late morning due to big crowd visiting but that's ok because after all this is a great place for family and friends to hang out
5
Menu is always changing which makes me look forward to coming to Habitat! If only the space is bigger! Went on a weekday lunch which was quiet. pasta was GREAT as usual and I still love the TRUFFLE FRIES!!!!!! Affordable food!
4
Impressed with the chiili crab pasta. Generous with the crab meat & there's mantou served with the pasta. Service was good.
5
Food was very delicious and at pocket friendly prices too. Portion is big enough for sharing, will come back again
4
Love the food I've ordered. The portion was just nice, and worth the price! It was really filling and satisfying for all of us.
5
Pre-purchased the 10% off voucher before I made reservation.
I had the Chilli Crab Linguine, generous serving and only cost $17.
The Matcha Lava was too sweet. The Sticky Date was fragrant with butterscotch and walnuts.
4
2nd trip to Habitat. the food is good and value for money as there is no GST and service charge. will return for sure!
5
I love the ocean linguine! A must try at Habitat coffee. Try to be early as it starts to get crowded from 1.30pm onwards even on a weekday.
3
Staff seemed a bit lost when I handed them the printout of my Chope voucher.They said they didn't know how to process it and had to make a few phone calls. Thankfully it was resolved.
3
This place is just 10 min' walk from my house yet I had not stepped in till last week. I went in planning to order churros and espresso for tea but decided on the pulled pork sandwich after reading the tempting description, for an early dinner instead. The sandwich (burger actually since the tender filling was between two pillowy soft brioche buns) was quite delicious and the affogato (yes, this item sounded more tempting than the espresso) was strong and the creamy. It started to rain heavily while I was eating. The cafÃ©, however, wasn't really a nice place to while away the time; the ambience ... well, in fact ... there wasn't much of an ambience. Or maybe I'm older than the general clientele. Good coffee though
3
Been a few times, prices are quite reasonable for a cafe but their portions are notably decreasing more and more since the first time I've came, namely the salmon pasta. Other dishes that have been ordered before were also inconsistent quality, can be really good at times
4
Food is good, served fast and yummy. Coffee is average. Must try the banana pancakes! Love it so yummy.
4
Truffle fries, coffee and fresh pressed juice were nice. Nice place to chill. Would have given 5 stars if they did not run out of sticky date and orange
4
It is awesome place to chill and catch up with friends but parking is a problem during peak hour especially now there is a lot of construction around
4
We visited HC at 8pm on a Sunday. It wasn't crowded so all good for space.Food was yum & quick. We had certain restrictions on food & the service staff were accommodating with our requests.The red velvet cake tasted dry. If you want your desserts served later, voice it out when you place your order. If not, it will all be served at one go.The service staff looked gloomy & no smiles at all, even when food is served.4 stars for ambience & food. Service levels need improvement.
3
First time in my cafe hopping experience that the desserts are served first, followed by main course and ending with starter.. The food portion is quite generous and filling..Wanted to try the matcha pesto pasta but it's no longer available on menu..Went during noon time and was told the berries pancake is out of stock.. Tried the caramelized banana pancake/hotcake, look and taste is good but the pancake is not fluffy and a little dry..The crab linguine is nice.. The chicken pop is delicious but felt it was slightly salty. The lemon tart tasted nice especially the biscuit part, however the lemon curd is surprisingly hard and firm, and the lemon taste could be better.. Tried the pulut hitam pudding and it's worth trying.. Not too sweet..Service wise is not that fantastic.. The grilled teriyaki salmon pasta is fantastic.. The dish that I like the most among the rest.. Not salty, the flavor is on the dot and salmon is cooked just nice..Staff appears to be insensitive, gloomy and not very approachable.. It would be better if they can put on a big smile on their face.
3
they have the right idea, and it is worth going, but with a little extra effort it could be more special. The service was ok but not exceptional, the food was tasty, the dÃ©cor was good but not distinctive. A variety menu and done efficiently. The staff were playing video games behind the counte
5
We have 3 kids and 6 adults and Habitat Coffee was surprisingly set up for families. At any point of time, we were not pressured to finish our food fast because of the long queues. We also don't have to wait too long for our food. Food wise, there is a good selection of brunch items as well as lunches. Coffee was great and my favorite is the molten lava cake which was awesome.
4
Me and my friends have went to Habitat Coffee several times. All of which are satisfying visits. The reason being, good coffee, decent food and nice ambience. Price-wise is not bad either, in the range of $20/person (as are other brunch/coffee places). They update their menus occasionally too and their website keeps it up-to-date
4
Habitat is inconspicuous among the shop houses along Thomson Road. Many restaurants are house in the stretch of shop houses. Parking is always a challenge.Came by on a Sat night for dinner. Not too crowded and the diners are causally dressed and young.Had a truffle fries which seems to be popular here. It's good for $8. Had the truffle mushroom pasta. Cream base and has a very strong truffle taste. Love it! Thought a little rich....coffee looks good too but gave it a miss. Will be back to try the coffee and other dishes!
4
The egg Benedict is awesome. Watery eggs on multi-grain toasts. It's crowded so need to register yourself at the door for a queue number. When the table gets available, there will be an automated call to you when you have to remember to accept the table else it gets cancelled by the system.
3
It was really crowded though we visited on a weekday afternoon. The place was also very noisy as everyone's talking very loudly.
5
Staff were extremely patient and it was a great experience overall.
Food cooked to perfection...
Cramped seating but this is only a slight discomfort..
Will be returning again
5
It was the first visit to Habitat Coffee for all four of us and so we ordered four different items from the brunch menu (Tomato Eggs Relish, Eggs Ben, Scrambled Chilli Eggs). All of it taste good! My personal favourite is the Truffle Salmon Scrambled, and a pot of Fruit Basket tea. Desserts (Ondeh Ondeh cake, Matcha Molten Lava cake, Matcha pie) were a tad too sweet for us though.
4
Ordered The Shrooms ($13) - two perfectly poached eggs on nicely fluffy brioche toast. This was super delicious; the homemade citrus Hollandaise sauce is quite unique & has a good hint of sourness to bring everything together. Also ordered a regular cappuccino ($4.90), which was delicious & fairly strong.Already can't wait to return here to try other items off their menu! Accepts credit cards - only for bills of at least $30 Free WiFi Accepts reservations - I used Chope #burppleXchope⚡ No power plugs No service charg
3
I judge brunch by 3 standards.1) Latté2) eggs Benedict 3) priceHC nailed the coffee. The EB on the other hand needs work. You don't serve EB on toast. Needs more than a teaspoon of Hollandaise, and I don't know what the meat was but it wasn't ham. Lastly, the menu is 2 dollars too much fir each entree.Really nice staff though. And cool interior.Keep trying. You'll get there
5
As usual, we weren't disappointed by Habitat's offerings! We had the Salmon Teriyaki Pasta + Chilli Crab Linguine + Shrooms and they were all delicious! Service was pretty quick too. Their coffee is really one of the best and dessert was also good! We had the salted caramel carrot cake that we all loved (
4
The dishes we ordered were delicious . We ordered the Chilli Crab Pasta , Teriyaki Salmon Linguine , Truffle Fries, a Salad dish and a sandwich dish . I enjoyed the food . I particularly like the Chilli Crab Pasta as it was kickass spicy . It is my level of spiciness , spicy enough to be called 'shiok'. However , my friend found it a little jer- lat after a while . The serving was big enough . I also their Truffle Fries was one of the best I have eaten. Its aroma and taste of the truffle oil were distinctive . I like strong Truffle taste. It is also not oily. The cappuccino was a letdown . My friend and I ordered cappuccino . The coffee was not bitter enough , it is also not frothy . The temperature came lukewarm which eventually turned cold quickly. In fact , it tasted more like a latte and a cappuccino. My other friend's Flat white was delicious . It tasted more bitter than my cappuccino. We feedback to the manager . Immediately , she offered to change our cappuccino which was a very nice gesture. The new cappuccino came a lot hotter ; however , it tasted the same - still bitter . If you enjoy strong/ bitter coffee like me, order the Flat White instead of the cappuccino. The Bailey Chocolate Cake was not impressive. It was a tad dry . The prices are inexpensive . I will dine at Habitat Cafe again !
5
Loved the setup of the place, has an upper and lower tier. We ordered the berry hotcake and shepherd's pie, and they arrived, beautifully dished out after a prompt wait. Wonderful food, extensive menu; we were spoilt for choice. Portion size is generous too! The staff were friendly and efficient, knowledgeable and were able to recommend various dishes to us when we inquired about them. Really enjoyed my visit here and would definitely return again!!
3
Truffle al Funghi pasta ran out at 1215pm on a weekday. Waffles machine broke down. We settled for seafood aglio aglio and pesto salmon pasta. Food was ok, though the pesto sauce was a bit rich for me halfway through. Will probably revisit for coffee and waffles as I heard it's good.
5
The Chilli Crab Linguine was delicious and not too spicy. $17 was worth it.Pick A Date was so popular that I had the last serving on that day. Generous portion and very filling even though I only had half of the Chilli Crab Linguine before that
4
The egg Benedict could be better. The hollandaise sauce is not as flavourful as it should. The poached egg is cooked to perfection though
5
Had a Chillax dinner date with girlfriends and they enjoyed the food there. The new menu display is also nicely done. Will dine again at habitat!
4
Came here for a brunch meal with my girlfriend. It's always packed with people and you might need to wait 5-10 minutes for your seat. Comes with a tablet queue system, key in your details and wait to be called. Big Ben breakfast is awesome!
5
Overall you are not likely to be disappointed but peak hours can be crowded so reservation is advised! Brunch food is good too!
3
We were there on a weekend afternoon. The service was not especially welcoming, comparing with a nearby cafÃ© where you genuinely feel the "welcome". Nevertheless, it wasnt inattentive and was acceptable. During crowded hours, you key in your number via an electronic system indicating your seat preference and number of people. This leaves you free to stroll around the shops nearby. A flat white comes with a double shot and a regular is $4.90 while a large(just more milk) is $5.90. The food came promptly and we were not hurried off even after we had finished our food. However, the place makes it hard for talk due to its tight sitting and small space. We could hear the couple next to us and we're sure they could hear us too. All in all, a weekday might be a better time to visit Habitat if you're looking for a place to chill.
4
Went for a Sunday morning breakfast. We arrived little early and waited for the cafe to open. We were first at the counter so no waiting. By the time we finished ordering there were several people in the queue so the place appears quite popular. We ordered sandwiches, waffles and egg Benedict along with coffee. The service was prompt and the food tasted great
3
The menu seems impressive but when we tried ordering some of the stuff, we were told that the item was not available for whatever reason although it was still early in the day. Food is nothing to shout about but their coffee is pretty decent. In that row of shops, I would probably rate it No. 2 for coffee
4
Went there a few times with friends to chit chat while enjoying a cup of cappuccino, latte or mocha or just simply coffee. The coffee is reasonably priced at cafe standard. What attracted me most is the simple yet cosy ambience with uniquely artistic wall pictures such as the toilet sign boards of robotic females and males done in chalk on board
5
We were ushered to our table immediately upon arrival so thank god for the prior booking! It wasn't our first time there and we knew that the food was delicious but we were pleasantly surprised again! The new offerings on the menu like chilli crab linguini were really yummy and the coffee was great as usual. Would definitely come back
4
We stopped by this place on weekend. The place was packed. The Q machine outside was useful. When your Q up staff will call your mobile phone. We ordered :- 2 Flat White which were very goodm- Pasta with sausages was nice. Lots of flavor and aroma. Noodle was al dente. - Ham and Cheese sandwich : good quality of ham and cheese. The bread was baked properly. The service was attentive enough without any service charge.
5
Really love the food in this café, my favourite Cafe! The prices are reasonable and the food is great! :) Service is excellent too! :D
3
Coffee's good. But the dark choc waffle is a little too bitter and the sea salt caramel ice cream texture is too icy / frozen.
3
One of the great coffee place around the area, hence always long queue to get a table. Better to go early or make reservation.
4
warm interiors with friendly staff, they have one of the best chicken shreds sandwich with a good portion at a reasonable price. great for small groups!
4
Pleasant cafe to have brunch and coffee with family and friends. Decor is simple and modern. The cafe uses old sewing machines as the base for tables which is really creative. I recommend the truffle fries and banana pancakes.
4
Mocha was great. Truffle egg salmon was great too. With plenty of scrambled eggs, truffle flavored, much salmon to my delight.
4
Good food at affordable prices. Nice cafe to chill and gather with friends. It's my second visit there
4
I came here with friends and the first impression I've gotten from the place is that it's very hipster-looking. Atmosphere is good. Food was good as well. The poutine was nice, though I'm not sure whether it's very authentic. It's a nice place to hang out and chill with friends on a lazy Saturday afternoon
4
Visited this cafe twice, the experience has been positive so far. The coffee and cake has been very good and consistent. Tried the latte and the coffee art on top is well done. The salted caramel carrot cake is one of the best I have tried in Singapore so far! Typically I do not select carrot cake, however this turn out to be a good choice indeed! Many come here for their other main courses, will try next time! The only down side is the parking if you drive, there are not many choices in front of the shop as this fills up fast throughout the day
4
this place is a definite must-go for hipsters around the area. the interior is pretty cool and the overall area was rather cozy and clean.1. food: we ordered a lava cake and green tea pesto pasta. the lava cake was AMAZING. the laza was oozing out and the taste was really delicious. kudos for the great cake :} however, with that said, the pasta was not so satisfactory. the pesto + green tea cream was rather heavy, so for those who are not a big fan of pastas with lots of cream/base, this is definitely a miss.2. staff: staff were pleasant and the food didn't take too long to arrive.3. waiting time: unfortunately, one would usually have to wait for around 5 min (15 min for larger groups) to get a table in this establishment.overall i would recommend for the sweet treats. a very cozy place to chill out and i'll definitely come again :
4
We dropped by for the cake and coffee and we're delighted. The home-made lava cake is magical. Coffee is great and flavourful.
4
Food was tasty and coffee good. Waiting time was long (40min) during our visit due to staff being short handed.
3
All the staffs look rather gloomy. I had Egg Benedict which I find it rather over-rated, not worth the price paid. Worse, with a dead huge cockroach just behind out seats.
5
The food is fantastic and the service great. It was an excellent experience!! Our extended Bruch of 5 hours made us feel at home as we enjoyed the food and chatted away.
3
Delicious brunch menu! The shrooms and eggs on brioche were generous, and chilli crab linguini was succulent without being too spicy. Coffee was a standout as always. Only issue is parking, v tough esp on the stretch outside the restaurant!
4
Dined here two days ago with my family for dinner. I was lucky enough to find a parking space right out the cafe. Since the visit was pretty last minute, we didn't reserve and it was pretty packed in the evening. This cafe serve all day breakfast dishes like eggs Benedict, baked eggs, poached eggs and oats. They also serve a variety of pasta dishes too. We ordered Oats and nuts bowl, poached eggs with mushrooms, fresh fruit juice and muddy buddy. The oats bowl had a generous serving oats with yougurt, honey and berries. The poached eggs came with sauteed mushrooms on top of butter toasted brioche and it was perfect. Just one slice with the knife and the egg yolk was oozing out. One of the best poached eggs out there for sure. You can order fresh fruit juices with a selection of two fruits of your choice. The muddy buddy is basically one espresso shot with cold milk served on shot glass and it was really strong and refreshing. They have a good selection of desserts like tiramisu, scones and chocolate cakes on display by the counter. Overall, the food was great and reasonably priced. The service was average as the barista looked grumpy and always hanging on his phone which looked pretty unprofessional.
3
Maybe we ordered the wrong dishes this time as I have always rated Habitat Coffee 4/5, except for this experience.My first mistake was not ordering the usual truffles fries which really has a strong truffle taste. Instead we got the Poutine, which is essentially fries with brown gravy and cheese. Meh, I would say.My wife had the Cheesynara which was fine, while I had some green tea pesto salmon pasta which I found an acquired taste.Thankfully, our affogato was the redeeming factor. We had the salted caramel ice-cream with our coffee, which was heavenly.I guess from now on, we will be getting the good old all-day breakfasts instead
4
I went to Habitat for lunch twice and it was packed with people. Interesting split level setting . Cosy and nice ambience . It was difficult to find parking . I went for afternoon tea yesterday and I had a table right away . My sister and I ordered the Egg Benedict , Spinach with Prawns Salad , Scone , Latte and Cappuccino with Skinny Milk .The Spinach Salad was yummy and the dressing had an interesting citrus taste . The prawns are fresh . The Egg Benedict was cooked to the right temperature . The egg yolk was runny . It did not have any taste of vinegar. In fact , it is the best temperature I have ever eaten . It is better than the Egg Benedict I had at a more expensive cafe in town . The eggs sat on a generous bed of shaved ham and toast . The scone was heated up . However , it tasted dry . It did not come with clotted cream , just butter and jam . I will not order their scone again . My sister had the latte and I had the cappuccino . The cappuccino was aromatic , smooth and creamy . More importantly , it did not taste acidic as I do not like the taste of the 'fruity' coffee . It did not have the complicated taste I like but it had enough punch to it . The design of the coffee was nicely done . I will go back to Habitat to have afternoon tea if I am craving for good quality cafe food . Avoid lunch time as you have to wait for table outside the cafe in the sweltering heat and it is difficult to find parking .
3
The place was very crowded when 4 of us stepped in. We were told to order at the counter which was pretty ok. But the space constraint made it hard to move around. The enclosed area also made chit chatting difficult as we could not hear each other. Food wise was pretty ok and my friends enjoyed their coffee
5
Ever since a friend introduced me to this cafe, every time I visit Singapore, I must have breakfast here! This is small cosy cafe, located a little far away from Novena (buses will take you there). Since the cafe has limited seating, one may have to wait a bit, but that's because the food is really good. I am a fan of the "Big Ben" Breakfast, which is sausage, hash browns, eggs and bacon. I like their coffees but its their molten chocolate cake with sea salt ice-cream that you absolutely must try. The staff are courteous and always serve with a smile
4
Cosy little cafe located at Upp Thomson Road. Been here twice for their food. Great cakes and latte art!
4
Professionally-made hot beverages and hospitable customer service.
Highly recommended to everyone in the neighbourhood
2
Cramped place, service needs a lot of improvement. Great coffee, nice spread menu, presentation & taste of food- good
4
The food was fantastic but the waiting time was really long. Hope to come back again to try out the other food!
1
The service here really needs a shakeup. When you issue customers take table tags READ THEM. Service staff were clueless and went around looking to serve.
Our coffees took too long.
3
Habitat is a very nice place to relax, have some tea or coffee and meet up with friends. I like the interior which gives people a cozy feeling of being at home. However, might be due to this coziness caused by size of cafe, the upper deck is always filled with noises of customers from other tables talking. Its sounds very much like you are in a tiny box with sound waves compressed into it. It makes my visits unpleasant sometimes because it is hard to hear and made myself heard to the person sitting opposite me. I tried the latte, mocha, fusion tea and pastries. To be honest none of the items i tried hits home. Coffees and chocolates/cocoa are not creamy at all; they taste like bitter water to put it simply. The fusion tea tasted like bottled iced lemon tea with flavored syrup. I always end up ordering the honey melon tea, because the flavor that I asked for is always not available. Cakes have great palatability, at the same time deceiving, because most of the time the cakes are dry.I tried items on the brunch menu too. My friends always get the bruschetta and tomato relish. I don't like too much tomato flavors in my food. I tired the Big Ben's once, it was...disappointing. Probably cause I've had one of the best Big Ben's somewhere else. Eggs Benedict was only passable too. The pasta can get too oily in my opinion, and under-cooked. Most choices only come in linguine. The fries there will be the next on my order list. They look too good. The staff there were nice people though. They always try to be polite and helpful, and always greet customers with a smile. Most of them are young people so they seem full of energy all the time
4
We read some decent reviews of Habitat Coffee and decided to try brunch there considering we were in the vicinity. There was a fair queue but we were given a queue number and got a table as promised, within 15 minutes.The menu's not very vegetarian friendly, so first feedback would be to have more vegetarian breakfast-y options. We ordered the Shrooms Benedict, Iced Hazelnut Latte, Iced Cappuccino, & the Churros. They were happy to change the bread from a Brioche to the Sundried Tomato bread. The coffee and the Benedict were really good - some of the best iced coffee I've had in Singapore. The sundried tomato bread was delicious and the poached eggs were beautiful. The Churros, however were a different story - the oil smelled stale and they tasted quite lousy. The Chocolate Ganache, though good, was too little.Where the really good service came in was that they looked into the Churros and were willing to make a new batch. When we refused, they refunded the money. On our way out, the staff members also thanked us for our feedback and promised to look into it. This level of service is a huge plus. I will go back - it's good value for money, the food is good, and the staff is very friendly
4
The cappuccino was creamy and smooth - balanced in taste! Really enjoyed it. Shared a slice of salted caramel cheesecake with friend, not too sweet and rich yet not sickly! Just right. However, the place was a tad noisy, probably due to bad acoustics of the small cafe. Despite seated right in front of the service counter after placing an order for two drinks and one cake, the staff actually forgot to serve the drinks! Interesting interior with vintage, old-school set u

If you are in the Upper Thomson Rd are close to the Marymount MRT station and you are feeling hungry, go for the chicken sandwich at the Habitat Coffee. This small coffee snack bar has good food in general, usually people go for lunch while having their work break or for brunch on weekends. Its quite small and difficult to get a table. I was generally happy with the food and their coffee but the chicken sandwich is the best. Enjoy
3
I had been to here twice. 1st time I had only coffee as the cafe was too crowded, we was so hungry amd dun have energy to wait but still left our name for tea break. 2nd time we had the dinner. Generally brunch is not too expensive but pasta charges quite high.Coffee - not really good one as I personally prefer stronger tasteDessert - I forget to check if the dessert made in house but based on experience most of them is notPasta - the taste is quite special especial green tea pesto but exp for us. The thing about creamy pasta is when we finished half way we felt too much cream.This cafe is crowded. The waiting times seems to be 30mins depends on crowd
5
The food was awesome! The price is really reasonable for a cafe and it's definitely worth the price! It's a cosy place to dine in! Went there and it's full house but the staff took down my particulars and gave me a call when there's an empty table! The staff was really friendly! Though the menu was quite limited but you will be spoilt for choices! The description looks good and you will have a hard time choosing but you will definitely visit it again
3
I don't think I can say too much because I came for a western meal, hoping to get decent sized servings for the price per pax which works out to about S$15.00. It didn't disappoint on size but it sure was one of the worse pastas I have eaten. It was just too watery and really thin on the cream. I did like the truffle fries though. However, I ran out of time to try the coffee or the waffles. I am sure that would have bumped the bill up by another S$5.00 per pax.I am ambivalent. Would recommend it for young adults who are less discerning but simply hungry
3
I came back for lunch recently, and the place is pretty packed by 12pm. I ordered a latte & ham & cheese sandwich. I guess you cant really go wrong with a ham & cheese sandwich. It’s taste pretty good with load of rocket veg, while the latte is a bit of a disappointment as it’s not hot enough. It’s a rather small cafe, so advise not to come during peak hours. I’m not crazy over the food nor coffee, but a nice place to chill on a slow afternoon
2
I thought we were lucky to get a table (outside) without waiting. The menu was basic but seemed appealing enough. Upon ordering, we were told food was taking 45 min. It just dding seem to be that busy, but ok, we were there already. Sitting outside in the occasional blast of seventh month smoke from up the street, we asked about the possibility of water at around 25 min, then received a bottle with 2 plastic cups to quench our smoked out thirst.At 30 min, I enquired of our coffees. Surely a couple of flat whites can't take 45 min as well! They arrived, one at a time a few min later. Decent quality coffee, at a par with 40 Hands, Loysel's etc. Churros were ok, maybe not quite cooked through though. Mains started arriving by 40 - 45 minutes, not up to expectations, compared to city competition, but acceptable. Kitchen timeliness is the killer here. There were groups waiting for tables - their wait would be so much less if we (and others) had their food in 15 rather than 45 minutes. Otherwise acceptable food and decent coffee, just not worth the ridiculous waiting time.
3
We went there this morning for brunch. There were bunch of people when we arrived, so we decided to stay outdoor and move in when there is a free table inside. There wasn't any fan or shelter for the tables outside. I think it would be better to have shelter for those sitting outdoor. We ordered the egg Benedict and egg & tomato relish. The dishes were good but service wasn't that great. First, they did not serve the juices at the same time. And we even ordered the same juice! Then the main came, but one by one. My partner had his egg Benedict served first and then mine (20 minutes later.) So instead of having brunch together, we watched each other having their own meal. The food and coffees were good but certainly the service need to be improved.
4
Great place to hangout along Upper Thomson Road, especially away from the sweltering afternoon heat. Iced coffee is decent, seafood aglio olio pasta was fragrant with garlic and very delicious. They do a pretty good eggs Benedict here too, but be prepared to wait 30-40mins to get a seat during the weekends. Don't ever order the shepherds pie though! The minced meat inside was literally bone dry and the accompanying bruschetta wasn't well seasoned. Overall still a great place to catch up with friends or complete some work
4
Be prepared to wait for 30-45mins during weekends brunch hours. This place is packed with teens hanging out for a good cup of coffee & brekkie. The coffee from Habitat coffee uses Proud Mary beans and is really aromatic. Beside the normal coffee choices they offered quite a bit of flavoured coffee as well, like macademia, hazelnut, tiramisu etc. I love their egg & tomato relish. Eggs, bacon and baby spinach cooked in tomato sauce. It is superb, tasty and absoutely delicious. Their cookies is nice as well.Tried the walnut chocolate cookie, and it taste yumms.. Would love to go back again, but thinking of the long waiting time really kinda puts me off
3
What really lets this place down is the long wait time. It's located on a row of shops facing the road and there really isn't anywhere else for you to go to while away the 30 minutes or so. After such a long wait, my expectations were sky high.My companion had an iced coffee which was very good. Robust, aroma of coffee and not too much milk. My drink was a disappointing iced tea which was cloyingly sweet without much flavour.The food wasn't much to shout about either. My back pepper fish pasta was cloyingly sweet (like my iced tea) and greasy to boot. The black pepper had been applied too liberally and overpowered the fish. My companion's eggs benedict was a bit better but nothing amazing.We did enjoy the truffle fries which were crisp and tasty

Great old school cafe on Thomson Rd. This place screams hang-out. It's always busy on account of good coffee, food & vibe. It's not flash, u order @ the counter, food takes a while, but I've yet to find better value breakfast in Sing. If u want to change pace it Sing, can't recommend better. Enjoy

Another great hangout place without charges, what you saw on the menu is what you need to pay for your meal. Initially we wanted to have lunch here but due to the crowd and more than 30mins waiting time, we went to other place for lunch. However they called us within 15mins, we request to keep puuting us on reservation list as I wanted to have coffee at their cafe.We got our coffees and Tiramisu ($3.90). I had Cappuccino($4.90) and it comes with nice latte arts and tiramisu should be one of the cheapest and nice I had although without alcohol. Their cake average sold at $3.90 per piece, not sure whether they made it themselves or they catered from other bakery shop. Their brunch looks good, can try next time if I pass by again
