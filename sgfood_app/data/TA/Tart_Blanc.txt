The best tarts in Singapore !! I went to this place last April with my mother in law for a tea /coffee break at 4PM. What a great surprise ! I ve never been there before and nobody has mentioned this patisserie before. I ve just discovered it during a walk at millenium walk. Obviously for my party, I think of them. All my friends discovered their patisserie and really loved : absolutely delicious, well presented. To sum up : fantastic. I offered to my guests a real experience to taste excellent patisserie in Singapore. You should taste on site or by ordering online or by call

I was introduced to this artisan cafe via a Groupon voucher which I purchased, otherwise I may not even know that this place exists.I chose to try a simple latte while my wife was drawn to a tea named Mint Cucumber. For a small artisan cafe like Tart Blanc I have to say that their cup of joe was impressive - rich in coffee yet smooth on the palate, not too saturated but still thick with flavor. Their tea was served with a fascinating standing tea strainer, infusing the cup with the subtle fragrance with an unmistakable lure.An array of assorted colorful tarts beckoned us and it was a tough choice, each one as delicious looking as the next. In the end we chose base on curiosity, picking an Earl Grey Chocolate Tart and Tiramisu Tart. While the latter was as delicious as its name sounds, it was the former that impressed us the most with its flavor by invoking the image of tea with each bite.Delicious as the tarts were, their price made them a costly choice for pastries. Each tart can be finished in as many scoops as you would a slice of cake so one could argue that they are only slightly more expensive than that. However they won my heart over with their tastes, so I guess that balances out the price factor, making it still a worthy choice
