Went in the bistro which was upstairs. Very low light. Hard to read the menu. Ordered drinks and food. We were then before eating presented with the bill. The food was very good, plenty of it to eat. There were many special deals, on beer etc. There was a live band.

Chanced upon this place when I was there with family queuing for the very popular Chinese steamboat. You can take the same lift to level 2 where the steamboat restnt is. Came here on a Sat night, there is a good crowd, usually young adults to hang out and listen to the live band, who songs mostly Chinese pop.There were both big and small groups to celebrate birthdays as well.Service is good, wait staff walks around to clear plates and ask you want to top up drinks.Food is average, but a good variety, more than your standard pub grub. I like their Lavender iced tea though, and when we were there, there was a 1 for 1 promo for a brand of whisky

Went on a friday night with reservation, and got a table near the band (directly in front of the speakers). Venue was quite packed. Food was okay, though a tad expensive. As we were directly in front of the speakers, it was terribly loud and we couldn't hear each other. Towers and beer were somewhat expensive in my opinion.Mostly populated with working adults and young couples and friends

Went here with family for dinner one night. Picked it out of the blue and looks like a popular place with younger locals looking for a night out. The food service was quite slow and some of the people I was with didn't get their food until about half an hour after the first meals arrived. Couldn't hear each other talking at the table as we were seated right next to the band, the place was packed so couldn't asked to be moved anywhere else. The food is not great and expensive, much better food choices available in Singapore. The atmosphere was pretty fun though with a nice crowd. Got to participate in a secret marriage proposal cheer squad! :

Been here once and recently ordered a delivery from Shuffle.. Their bak kut teh was interestingly delicious, as they used pork slices instead of big chunky pork ribs. Also tried one of the fried rice (with satay) on its menu, but this dish was pretty salty. Their truffle fries were a little hard but very flavourful. Will be back to try more dishes next time

The food is nice with a good list of drink choices. I see most tables, especially in big groups, ordering beer towers. The band is great and the singer sings very well. The songs they perform were mostly popular English and Mandarin hits.I went on a Sat night, it was very crowded, we were almost rejected as it was full house. But luckily it was just me and another friend being there for the 1st time to check this place out. So it's probably easier to squeeze out 2 seats for us. Would suggest that you be there early or make reservations if going in big groups. Would definitely come again

The finger food is really good! We ordered carrot cake with spam chips, fried buffalo wings, truffle fries, salted egg yolk prawns & topshells and I must say they all tasted !The band plays both English and Chinese songs and they were great too. Seat is comfortable. Waiters are all friendly and helpful. Will definitely visit again.

Advise: Call to make reservations/use Chope app especially if you've a large number of paxFood Variety was so impressive & not disappointing! didn't had chance to try much but my friend had a the Fresh Clam soup and it was so delicious with the sweetness of the clams with bread served on the side. Will definitely go back to try their other food should i have a chance to.Beverage wise also a large range of options and the happiest thing is that they have my favorite Hoegarden Rose and even serve it in a tower!Band was no doubt fantastic, very obvious for the Chinese crowd. They are like a Chinese version of timbre where they sing 80% of famous chinese karaoke hits and 20% popular english songs as well! Band and singer was very good!They've special entertainment installed especially for birthday babies to spin the wheel to try your luck to see what goodies you may get (E.g. free shots, or pizza)They even have group games available to borrow to your table (E.g. Crocodile teeth biting, or the sword poking barrel with the pirate popping Games)its a Definite 10/10 stars for Shuffle and would be recommending it to my friends & family

Visited on 20 april 8 pm. Primarily to recce the venue for a corporate function. Had dinner and drinks. We ordered fish and chips, carbobara and salted egg prawns. All is still decent though the fries seem to be re-fried again. The live band - Music Stream - was really good and lively. Overall a good experience. Recommended for those to experience local live band culture and food. The staff were very polite and attentive
