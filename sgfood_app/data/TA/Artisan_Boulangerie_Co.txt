nice, cosy ambience; the cakes and pastries are tasty; the coffee break set (one drink and one cake) is reasonably priced at $8.88++
5
This place didn’t disappoint. Their croissant and pain au chocolat are amazing. The cafe latte feels like you’re drinking a silky cloud. Service is efficient and the staff is friendly.

Their Hazelnut crunch at Katong branch was bad. Few hazelnuts and they were rancid, stale n oxidised. Tried giving feedback to the staff, not asking for refund but they looked shocked and defensive.
5
Nice place, causal cafe, coffee are nice. Go with kids, they like the babychino and kids meal.
Recommended.

We had breakfast here and ordered an open sandwich, pancakes, coffee and fresh orange juice. Quite nice and filling. Good coffee too!

Around the corner from the Westin Singapore. If you want a traditional breakfast or just a great coffee pop in here.By sharing your experiences, you're helping travellers make better choices and plan their dream trips. Thank you!

Been here regularly, for my coffee fix and breakfast! Cosy and comfortable venue! A place u know u could have decent coffee and pastry!!

We visited their branch at Katong 112 for Sunday brunch. The service is attentive and the bread as usually excellent. They are one of the neibourhood bakeries that we stock up our breads regularly. For less than S$20 we each have a main course (salads, cheese burger & risotto) plus a wonderful cuppa. A great start of our activities filled Sunday. Self service drinking water is available near the counter. What I don't like is the system of seating down first then go to the counter to place the orders for the table. How much labour cost can they really save by inconveniencing the customers? We simply simplified our order to a drink and main

Recently been back to Great World City Branch, the coffee and pastries was good as usual but there is something missing that is the personal touched in the service of the staff. You used to have a manager by the name Derek he is always very engaging and comes back to ensures I had a great time in ABC he took my feedback very seriously about how I wanted my coffee to be done and makes sures all the staff members knows. I am hoping to meet Derek again, thanks for having such a great manager like Derek around that going out of his way to pleased its customers

Went here for Brunch. Hands down, best Almond Croissant I have had in a long time. Soooo good. Had a juice as well and was lucky with a special - all drinks $4. My husband had the plain croissant and was also happy. Would certainly return when I come back to Singapore again.
4
Very nice location and good food and great coffee. Convenient location for orchard meetings or for a quiet meeting away from the hustle and bustle of the main roads.
3
The scenery of the place is nice, fell good looking at the street. But the prices are expensive, especially for pastries. I just went for a coffee.
4
That was the only cafe that was opened during the 1st day of Chinese New Year during my staycation at Lloyd's Inn. Very nice place to relax with a book over coffee. Love the Lemon tart!
3
Came here for lunch today with a friend. It's not too busy on a weekday lunchtime so no issues getting a table. Good selection of food available but relatively expensive for what you get.
3
Their menu seems to have expanded over the years. In addition to the pastries and cakes, they have quite a robust selection of all day breakfast meals , salads and other stuff. Rather pricy though
4
Its a shopping centre style coffee shop. The staff were friendly & the coffee was reasonable even if it was only lukewarm when it came. When this was brought to their attention the coffees were remade with apologies. We had 2 coffees & 2 cakes which set us back $22.50. The coffee prices were a bit steep, more than at other places around Singapore so it was a bit dissappointing they couldn't get it right the first time
4
the coffee is always good and the bread and pastry selection are always a nice addition but it is a tad pricey. location is very central, just minutes away from somerset station and you do get a feeling of community especially with the weekend brunch crow
4
Was there on a Sunday afternoon and was surprised that it's fairly empty. Great place for a book or to catch up with friends, undisturbed by crowds. Was hoping to get some emails done but disappointed that there's no wi-fi. Coffee is great, as expected of ABC's standards. Did not try the food but menu looks enticing enough for me to visit again
5
Absolutely loved the Almond croissant, divine! We stayed nearby for a week and ate here a couple of times and took pastries back to our hotel. Excellent food, can highly recommended as well as their teas and coffees. Great little place to duck in for a snack or meal. We'll miss it
2
We visited the branch in I12 mall for brunch recently, and had a poor experience. (1) They made no effort to warm up the bread that was served with my daughter's omelette.(2) the pancakes were not made to order, as it was cold and stiff when served. When we notified the staff about this, they had the audacity to ask if we wanted to return it. Of course we wanted to return it! When it came back, the pancakes were not replaced with freshly made ones ie. they simply stuck it in a microwave oven to heat it up. Absolutely pathetic. McD can do a better job!I certainly won't be coming back any time soon
4
Tried their flat white coffee and pear and almond tart at the Katong 112 branch! The combination is excellent! On weekdays after 3pm, you can have this promotion of "Coffee break" of any pastry (priced at $6.50) + hot beverage for $9.50!
3
Went there since its near my new appartment. Was exited but then kind of disapointed by the quality of the food. Will go there again to give it another shot
3
I had a green tea latte here. Overpriced, if I say so myself. On the whole, just your average fancy pastry cafe with many options for coffee and tea.
2
A poor first impression.
Paid a premium for mainly egg and pastry.
no signature ingredients at all.
Disappointed.
5
We had breakfast here. They were busy but the dining area is big.
The service was fast and food was great! It was nice experience.
4
We’d been here before so this is a review on a second visit after two years. We were in a hurry and needed to have a really quick lunch. This place turned out to be an excellent choice. We’d really liked it two years before and this time was just as good. We had a quiche and a focaccia sandwich with soft drinks. They were available quickly and we enjoyed both
4
I think there are several "ABC" cafes in Singapore - this one is on Killiney Road and for a start off its espresso coffee is very good. As far as we could judge, pretty much everything from the bakery was fresh that morning, it all looked yummy and what we tried was all of very good quality. We had breakfast there twice during our August visit to Singapore. I can recall a smoked salmon and dill quiche and an excellent granola with fresh yoghourt. There are all the usual full breakfast items available too
4
Tucked away in a corner of Killiney Road, Artisan Boulangerie's storefront is innocuous enough that passersby can be forgiven for not knowing it exists. This is perhaps by design, as inside its spacious confines, one finds an island of relative serenity increasingly uncommon in contemporary Singapore's frenetic everyday existence. The restaurant is loosely divided into three 'zones': 1) a relatively snug area of two-seat tables;ii) a more lounge-like section with low-slung quasi-sofa like seats; iii) a wide-open area akin to a university cafeteria's row-like seating arrangement (and indeed seems populated by students glaring intently at laptop screens). For all this variety, the atmosphere is remarkably cosy, and the tendency to linger in such comfortable surroundings is accentuated by the excellent quality of the food. Our tomato soup was served piping hot in ample quantity bursting with rich fresh-off-the-vine flavour; the fusilli was a vivid splash of colour and flavourful tastes; the sliced beef sandwich delicate to the palate accentuated by slightly sweet egg bread. As for the desserts both the Hazelnut Crunch and Pain Chocolat were worth their not inconsiderable prices and found excellent accompaniment in the cafe latte and long black bursting with the aroma that only freshly ground beans can exude. Not the cheapest of places but definitely the right place to spend a comfortable, lazy Sunday afternoon
4
Fantastic deli - we had the open avocado egg sandwich: scrambled eggs,cherry tomatoes, mushrooms, beacon, Turkish bread (and ordered a side of smoked salmon, the missus had the wygu burger. Both were awesome! Plus a couple of glasses of Chardonnay....67 sing dollars. Really good value, lovely staff. Will definitely go bac
4
Went there over the weekend with my family to have breakfast. Overall food was very tasty. Staff were very polite and friendly. How ever just one small tweak. I hope that your "big breakfast" would include some baked beans or hash brown. Other than that, was pleasant breakfast:
5
We had cappuccino post dinner at the Robertson Quay outlet on 25th june. The coffee was strong and flavoursome . It was served piping hot which is rare in Singapore. Highly recomended for hot cappuccino.
4
This place does the best chai lattes ever! Their toasted ham and cheese croissants are fantastic and also their cooked breakfasts (such as omelettes) are great. Service is quick and efficient.
4
Delicious food at affordable prices. Had lunch here and enjoyed their wagyu burger and mushroom truffle soup. Pastries are also bestsellers!
3
I was here for a friendly catch-up with a friend. I ordered the hot chocolate and he ordered the tea. Overall, the hot chocolate was nice, but the tea was pretty dreadful.
4
13 July 2016 - ordered cinnamon roll $4, bacon leek quiche $7.5, New York cheese cake and cappuccino. The recent time I was here with friends, we just had le cafÃ©. The people here were friendly and helped us with photo taking. This time I brought my family to share my experience. Limited coffee choices and other drinks - few variety. I think it makes them more focused on the boulangerie choices. I had the cinnamon roll before a year ago and I really liked it. That's why the returning factor
3
The egg and avocado toasts, the egg benedicts... legendary.The pasta / salmon... wayyyyyy too creamy and oily, you don't even feel the pasta at some point, it's drowning in sauce. Carrot juice is delicious. Avocado lassi (9$?!?) is... mostly ice. Can't even taste the avocado.The NewYork cheesecake is full of lemon (not mentioned when you buy it).The warm chocolate cake and the croissant : perfec
5
Whether it's lunch or tea, we are never disappointed, especially in their Great World City outlet. From sandwiches, pasta, mains to pastries, Abc manages to deliver good quality every time we are there. Staff are friendly and pleasant to talk to, keep up the good work
4
Since my first review, we went back to this branch quite a few time and also recommended a few of our friends to check this place out. All of our friends were quite impressed. I also visit this brand in Katong and at Changi airport too. We also went to Changi branch twice the quality of coffees there was poorer than this branch and katong branch.Barista at Changi airport wasn't paid enough attention while making a coffees. The look of coffees was not nice as same as the taste.
5
My husband and I had breakfast nearly each morning of our stay and were amazed with the quality and variety of the food. We also had lunch once and supper on another day. The pastries are to die for and we were not able to sample all on offer. The made their own breads and rolls and many savoury tarts and pies as well the sweet equivalent. The drink menu was extensive. The tables were well spaced and the air conditioning not overwhelming. Staff were very helpful and friendly and service fast and efficient.Should you be in the Killiney Rd area, ABC is a must
4
My friend & I ate at the Vivo City outlet several times for breakfast & lunch during our stay in Singapore. The service was attentive and prompt even though they were busy each time we visited. We did find the drinks to be a little pricey so after the first visit we skipped the drink and just had the free water. The freshly squeezed juices were nice though.We had the ABC Big Breakfast a couple of times and then the Roast Chicken Breast for lunch on another occasion and can highly recommend both. Really delicious and filling!! Would definitely go back again
1
Went to the Changi Airport outlet expecting some quality breakfast. Was I wrong. Stale croissants & pain au chocolates. Service without a smile. Should have been warned of by the empty seats.
5
All their salads are good. A bit pricey for the amount of salad you get, but sooooo good! You can get fresh juices, breads, and baked treats. Order at the counter, grab a free glass of water. Eat inside or outside (i12 Katong)
5
We visited this place on Killiney Road today for coffees and bakery. We ordered 2 Flat White which perfectly made as coffee artwork, nice aroma and very pleasant aftertaste. The plain croissant was crispy outside, fluffy & soft inside and also lots of layers. The taste was perfect. The service was attentive and friendly. We would love to go back again to try more
4
Been to ABC on numerous occasions and the coffee and desserts are great. I work at Asia Square and there's an ABC just downstairs. ABC offers a comfortable environment for a short catch up which is where I take my mates who visit. Service is decent and the interior is simple and not overdone which makes it a relaxing place to be.
5
I work very close to the location at Chevron House. Great granola with yogurt, which is a usual breakfast when I haven't managed to eat at home. Really like the grilled veggie/pesto sandwich. Good coffee too. Service is really friendly. There isn't much seating area, but I like to have chats with colleagues here and usually can get a spot
4
Go when the shop on Killiney road opens around 8 am for some rather good croissants. In Singapore's humidity, it's best to enjoy these pastries soon after they are baked. Thought the croissants here much better than Tiong Bahru bakery where I have on 2 occasions found to be under baked after getting a takeout.The breads at ABC are good too though a little on the pricy side
4
This is a must visit whenever I am in Singapore. I just love the eclairs and fruit tarts here. Helps that I usually bunk with a friend staying nearby so I can pop by every evening on my way back from the MRT.Try the eclairs, tarts and croissants. The mixed fruit tart especially is delish!It can be crowded on weekends brunch time though.The serving crew here is also very friendly and accommodating when I was here with some young ones and they found us a seating arrangement that suited a large party
4
We chanced upon the outlet at Katong I12 and it quickly became our regular on Saturdays. The brunch menu is varied and the price is reasonable. We have also had lunch and found their small menu very decent. The cakes and tarts are uniformly good although the variety is not as extensive as in a proper pâtissière. What really surprised us was their baguette - crusty, rather chewy and surprisingly good (with a touch of sour dough I suspect). Would have made a Parisien boulanger proud
3
The sour dough bread was amazing from the outlet in Katong 112 Mall but it tasted absolutely different (less sour but more bitter and hard) from the outlet in VivoCity. Just went to the branch in VivoCity Mall, ordered latte, Pan-Seared Seabass Fillet and Sourdough. The latte was a disappointment, it came with a small glass and the latte volume was not up to the full glass - pretty much the least amount I have seen in Singapore. Quality wise, diluted - not rich and smooth. Coffee bean selection was okay with not much comment. I believe the barista underestimated the milk or it might be their style.Pan-Seared Seabass Fillet was fresh, I like the light pumpkin sauce. The not so good part was the very oily vegetables and the seabass' skin should be a lot crispier.Service wise, average service
4
I chanced upon the outlet at terminal 2 before my flight. I ordered the croissant and chai tea latte. Sgd 3 for a crossiant. Could not complain much as the quality was good. Have the croissant heated up. It tasted fresh , soft and buttery. Almost similar the ones in europe. Overall prices were ok. I did not try the pastas but i saw others ordering them. Quantity looks decent . The pastas wete hovering around 15 to19 sgd per plate. There were set lunches and breakfasts available which were between the range of 15 to 20 sg
3
Ordered their pancake with sausage and bacon. Not very fantastic taste. It's a self service cafe so even if cutlery, water etc you will need to DIY.
5
Portions are huge, eggs benedict were excellent. Healthy juices are yummy. Cakes and breads almost like in Paris !
4
This restaurant is opposite the hotel,"Orchard Grand Court", we stayed in on Killiney Road.
The price and food are excellent. There are also many traditional restaurants nearby.
4
Have been to Katong and Vivo and they are both terrific. Wonderful staff and delicious food and coffee. So refreshing!
3
I was there to enjoy my break while waiting for my friends to arrive at the terminal two airport.Although they may not be the one that serve good coffee, but the Chocolate Lava Cake is rich and yet not too sweet which is worth the try.Average price for a set of cake with coffee: S$14-18/perso
1
Below average food, non-existent service. Went to our table, none of wait staff took any notice of us even though it was not busy. Had to go ask for menus ourselves after waiting around. Asked an uninterested waitress for cutlery and she simply pointed to the tray right in front of her. There was no self service sign. Waste of time and money for below average food and lack of service. Will not return again.
5
I have Visited ABC at Killiney Road for lunch during my vacation couple times. Each time was amazing. Staff is just excellent, friendly and looking after you. Food is really good, especially pastries and desserts. Yes, its a bit expensive, but value for money and you would not be disappointed with it. Service is very fast. Would definitely be back
4
Was at Killiney Road and needed breakfast. Headed here for a quick one. I got:- Smoked Salmon & Dill Quiche: $7. They will heat this up before serving you. This had a side of salad and vinegrette. I like the taste of this. Would order this again. - Flat White: $6.10. I ordered this with an extra shot of Espresso. Coffee was alright. The extra short kept me going for the day. A fuss-free and easy breakfast. Good for a quick pick-up or sit down casual breakfast
5
Visited the cafe at vivo city. Friendly staff, quick service and quality good for reasonable prices. Both my wife and I have been to this cafe many times with a consistent experience of the above. If you find yourself at vivacity and need a quality coffee and some food, I highly recommend this outlet
5
Love the quiches with the salad next to them. Tonight I had the pasta with pesto sauce, peas and zucchini. It was really delicious.The service is good but you have to order at the counter. For me that was not a problem.They also have delicious bread and pastries
5
Hot new brunch place in town. Love their creamy nice breakfast menu downed with beautiful cappuccino or cold lemon tea. I've frequented ABC in the i12 Katong Mall and have loved it every time. Hoping to see the one in Suntec open soon.
4
Needed a cuppa to get going for the morning. So I popped into ABC for a cup of latte.
Simple and fuss free. Coffee is good.
Its good. What I needed to get me going for the day.
5
Why go to a French style bakery when you are in Singapore? Well if you are like me sometimes you need a change of pace, no matter how good the Chinese/Indian/Malaysian etc food is. And since I live just down the road sometimes I cannot ignore the lure of ABCâ€™s sweet ricotta croissant! There is a nice breakfast selection, pastries and more elaborate fare, and they recently expanded the Killiney location so there is now ample seating. The dinner menu is pretty good too, with some nice & interesting salads. (Sometimes- to my embarrassment since the staff recognise me by now-I find myself there twice a day!). Just a note: while all their pastries are very good, and I enjoy the quiches & pies as well, I think the best plain croissant can be found at Tiong Bahru bakery
3
We were in the VivoCity branch for Sunday brunch. We got the Eggs Benedict (without the salmon and ham), a DIY Omelette (with Mushrooms, Caramelized Onions, & Mozzarella), a side of Roasted potatoes, a Latte, & a Cappuccino with an extra Espresso shot.The Eggs Benedict was nice - the Hollandaise sauce a tad on the sourer side though. It would've been nice had they offered to replace the fish/meat with mushrooms or peppers considering the price was the same. The Omelette was passable, slightly grainy on the palette. The baguette it came with was outstanding. Also, the mesclun mix with the balsamic reduction was lovely. The potatoes were regular.The coffees were good. Pastry from here that I've had on a separate occasion was delicious, which was what made me want to try brunch. I'll probably stick to their bakery section
3
We ate at the Great World City branch for the first time. I really wanted a panini but on the menu the cheese and ham panini was very expensive at $20 which comes with salad and chips. I asked if I could have the panini without salad and chips i was told I could but I would still be charged $20!! This is probably the most expensive panini in Singapore as a top hotel like Marriott in Orchard sells panini for just $9!! So not sure how they can justify such a high price for a simple panini!!! Anyway my husband and I decided immediately that there is no way we are paying $20 for a panini as it is a ridiculous price and went for quiche instead.I have to add that they do the best quiche. We had both types of quiche and loved it. Their hot drinks were also good and nice pastries
2
It is really a shame for a place of this standard not to even have wifi. The food is good but quantities limited and somehow overpriced, especially for the drinks. Not to mention the air-condition being insanely strong. Overall, it makes it difficult for a customer to feel comfortable enough, stay longer than usual, and ultimately consume more
4
We had 2-3 hours before our next appointment and we are along Orchard Road. Decided to check out this cafe along Killiney Road as hubby has been their outlet at Vivocity.It is a quiet cafe in a quiet area off Orchard Road. We ordered a flat white, a hot choc and a dark chocolate tart to share.The drinks were ok.. But I like that the dark chocolate tart has a thin layer of raspberry jam to balance the intensity of dark chocolate. Yum, would definitely try their other desserts if I come back
4
We have had breakfast, brunch, lunch and afternoon tea on different visits to Singapore and always enjoyed the food. The service has been quick and friendly. Order and pay at the counter and the food is served to you. This visit be tween us we ate eggs Benedict, lovely fresh salads, hamburgers, freshly squeezed juices and good coffee. It is in a quaint area with many 'local Singaporean food outlets'
5
This is my favourite place for breakfast...Each trip that I made back to Singapore, this is THE place for me.Love the way the staff greets their patrons, their smiles and their jovial attention. Food is great, no complaints at all. Great place for a healthy breakfast, a nice lunch, a meeting place for mums with their babies and an afternoon tea/coffee. Patrons are polite and well-behaved. Fully recommended. Keep up the good name
3
I buy my bread from ABC and it's awesome - some of the best sourdough in town. The cakes and food are good. However the sit down service at the Great World City branch is terrible and it is also not cheap. Today we had two coffees, a burger and a sandwich. The coffees came first but separately then the burger came then no sandwich till I chased for it ... And they are pre made! Beware
5
Enjoyed my breakfast with good French baguette, chocolate and took away croissant. Good service value for money! Exactly like in my country side city. Keep up.
4
i needed a relaxing break in a pressured working week - they provided good espresso - and an excellent small quiche. Orange juice was also good. The seating was comfortable and i came ut refreshed. Seems good for people to meet - very active. fun!
3
Been here many times for lunch and coffee when my office was nearby. This morning had brunch with friends on a public holiday, and my 1st reviewDecor is scandanavian wood-chic and spacious . If you order anything more than a slice of bread, you pay at the counter first and wait for the food to be deliveredMy eggs benedict with parma ham was ok. The ham was overly streaky and fat, and not of the higher grade. My friends who had the eggs ben with smoked salmon didn't like itExpensive at $25 for eggs ben and ice tea, and almost self service. Meat pies are $10, and tarts/cakes at $7. Not cheap eithe
4
The bread in Singapore is generally terribly sweet, fluffy and just inedible. But this is a great bread shop to get some sourdough loaf, there are several options with walnuts, sweet etc... We bought the traditional Cobb and it is really good. Toast it and can freeze as well the boulangerie is downturns level B3 in great world city shopping mall
1
Terrible experience, i hate when i get scammed. Yesterday evening i ordered 2 fresh squeezed orange juice to take away, i received 2 small plastic cups with over 10 ice cubes in it and 1 cm of orange juice, i went back to the lady to ask how they can sell to customer the orange juice in that way, that's cheating and it can be reported, she was very embarrased, and she apologized immediately. So be warned if you go there and ask for orange juice( ask for no ice)
3
We were quite satisfied with ABC once it opened, in Kiliney, and for several months. All products were of very god quality and, although staff turn over was visibly high, we could be served relatively fast and smile. After a while, new few shops in Singapore and diversification of the menu, things started to worsen.1) prices were regularly increasedand more importantly,2) quality of products,especially bread, decreased. This was particularly noticeable in subsidiary shops that were delivered by the main one (Killiney) where the oven was located. And,3) in majority of the shops, staff seems to be really unhappy to serve (e.g. in Change Alley) or tells you to wait outside until 8h00 am so that the shop can open (e.g. Killiney, @8:05 am).As a conclusion I would say that this promissing shop ended up providing disappointment and frustration.
5
We visited this cafe for breakfast. At first we almost didn't find it since the building its in was covered by scaffolding and you have to look past this, where the cafe is situated on the ground floor.For breakfast we ordered a mozerella, caramelised onion and mushroom omlette, muesli, shakshouka, french toast, an almond croissant and plain croissant.Have to say quality/taste of food was very good. Especially the muesli which was just the right texture in creamy yoghurt. The almond croissant was exquisite. A rich gooey center of almond paste and crip pastry on the outside. Get this toasted for maximum crunch/flavour!. The french toast was soft (brioche) and just the right amount of sweetness. Quite filling. If you can finish off your portion, you are good till a late lunch! The omlette was how an omlette should be; light and fluffy but this one was a bit chewy since I asked for mozeralla so as good as expected. The shakshouka was flavourful egg dish with a zesty tomato base.We would have liked to come back to this cafe to try out the other pastries etc on offer but unfortunately our trip to singapore was coming to an end to didn't get a chance to come back. Service was friendly enough and efficient. Will definitely try and visit the next time
1
I went to enjoy dinner after work at vivocity. I ordered, but never received my food,a simple risotto. I was told the chef didn't see the receipt. Why not is my question? Are they so unorganised they have no communication system? Despite one person taking my order and another at the cash, no one realised that no food came out after 35 min. I asked for my money and left, unfortunately I still had to pay for the $6.50 drink even though I wouldn't have ordered if I wasn't going to get my dinner. They did offer some pastry or something, but it wasn't clear if that was because it would be fast and feed me or if it was complimentary. The people have no sense of having customers. I wouldn't bother with this place considering all the other good options in the mall.
4
Went to ABC this afternoon at 112 Katong (its a mall, along upper east coast road). The place was nicely put together compared to the previous tenant. As it was tea time, there wasn't too many customers in the place. Mostly mothers with their infants. Anyway, like many of the reviews before me, I find the pastries and cakes simply delightful. Unfortunately,the experience ends there. The drinks that are available do not complete the experience. If only they have a better selection that pairs with their pastries and cakes. Indoors and outdoors dining is available. This is not a full service restaurant, so you have to place your orders at the counter and perhaps even get your own cutlery. Nevertheless, their staff were very attentive and helpful
5
Breakfast was very good, brioche french toast. Mmm. Coffee excellent and both dinners I had there were very good. They have takeaway pastries, both savoury and sweet. Quiche I had was great. Not in the least surprised that they were just about to expand their dining area
5
Fabulous coffee, great service and always looked well patronised by both locals and visitors. Yummy variety of tarts, the pear and almond tart was particularly delicious. Our daily coffee fix here was an occasion to relish
5
The cake is not cheap but it's worth every penny, so hard to come by exciting recipes like this in Singapore! They also have a brand of amazing drinks at their Chevron House location.
5
Loved the Chocolate Banana Croissant and the Beef Pie, it was really delicious. Great ambience and relax atmosphere, good for weekend brunch or office coffee breaks.
4
Organic quinoa crush was so tasty, you could forget it's healthy too. Chicken Caesar salad was delicious.
Great selection of teas - Earl grey lavender went particularly well with the salted caramel lava cake!
5
We stopped here for a quick lunch. We decided to sit down but you can also ask for a take-away sandwich. The menu is already mouth-watering and the actual dishes even better. More importantly, all the prices are nett (so not plus plus) and varies between 10 and 25. Drinks are expensive but there is a small table where they keep cold water and hot tea which you can take as much as you want for free! We ordered a wiener schnitzel (18) and a salad (14). They were excellent, both in taste and quality of the ingredients. Highly recommended!
3
Service - somewhat friendly. Somewhat attentive. All self serving. Indoor seating was a bit warm. It was cooler outside on a Saturday afternoon Food - cafe food, nothing too exciting. Salad we had was alright. Drinks - nothing to excitingHappy hour for wine For afternoon chill we had - Sauvignon blanc. Moscato. Chicken salad. Coffee eclair.

In a town known for its culinary delights and variety of cuisines, it's still damn hard to find a decent baguette. Or even a good Western breakfast for that matter. Most places try too hard, put their own spin on something that should always be simple or just can't source the ingredients to provide a quality full English. Please, for the love of God, no more chicken/cheesy sausages, canned mushrooms or deep fried burgers in my English Breakfast... Thank God, abc in I12 Katong doesn't go there. They do a great choice of breakfasts with their abc full english breaskfast topping the bill. The baguettes are the closest you will find to a quality Parisian baguette Ã  l'ancienne and on top of that they do an excellent array of sandwiches, croissants, pies and pastries. They are not the cheapest but - like few places in Singapore - their relatively high prices are justified by the quality of the food...... and indeed the service. Justin (or "Uncle Baguette" as our two year old calls him) and his team (and they genuinely give the impression of enjoying working together) are the friendliest and most proactive staff we've come across in nearly three years in Singapore. Service in Singapore can be very professional. But more often it is 'functional with no smile' or utterly amateur (just check Cedele next door to abc if you want to experience how Michael Douglas felt in "Falling Down"). But it's very rare to be met with sincere smiles and a naturally laid back yet professional atmosphere which these guys put on. Bit i guess Singapore is not known for being natural or laid back... So Bravo Uncle (and Auntie) Baguette et al at abc @I12 Katong! Thanks for breaking the mould

This place is about an 8 minute walk from Somerset MRT along the famed Killiney Street. There are quite a few places to eat on this road. The space is modern cafe with some typical cafe chairs and a few tables with banquettes. I came with the intent of trying out there baked goods as well as their lunch menu - unfortunately, their menu is limited but the duck confit was a special of the day! I ordered that which was pricey at $28 with no sides, although the cashier told me they could give me a small salad?!?!? I also bought chocolate and almond croissant and a caramel pecan/walnut tart as well as a cafe mocha.My first credit card got rejected (which my credit card company blames on the restaurant) then after I pay and sit with my coffee and tart, I'm told that the duck is sold out, and I need to pick something else. I'm getting peeved and hangry at this point because I already have my dessert and coffee so I ordered the Shakshouka skillet. Just when I thought service couldn't deteriorate more, a server came by to take away my pager (which lets you know your food is ready for pickup at the counter) saying "you're not having any food right?" Um, I hope so? Anyways, the Shakshouka was alright, it's 2 eggs sunny side up in tomato sauce. I've had better. The pita bread and mocha were both okay. The tart was typical tart, nothing outstanding although I will mention that it's advertised as a pecan caramel tart and it was a combination of pecans and walnuts (cost saving?) however I saw it when I ordered it so was aware of that fact. The croissants I later had at home and the next day. The chocolate croissant was alright but the chocolate strips were all on one side of the croissant so that I only got chocolate on half the bites. I've never seen this on a croissant before (and I eat a LOT of chocolate croissants!) it speaks to poor quality control. The almond croissant was too sweet for me but I bought it for my partner. Unfortunately it had gotten a little soggy by the next day. Overall, it's a cafe with a limited menu and nothing very exciting or original on the menu. The service is uncoordinated as well, so I can't recommend this place as there are simply better cafes out there for much less money - even French styled ones for those craving a Western escape

I would say the place is more suitable for the younger generation (cafe style) as my folks didn't really enjoy it. The food we ordered was fine just the portion is not enough for my folks, wouldn't blame them. So yeah, can't comment much on other food

We found this little gem on our tenth or eleventh trip to Singapore and wish we had known about it sooner. The food was absolutely delicious. We had a few little ones with us and they allowed us to reconfigure the tables We will definitely be back. Try the chicken schnitzel
5
On my recent visit to Singapore I visited the Queen Street store several time for coffee and snacks.
It was clean and sharp in presentation and the sfaff were excellent. I really enjoyed everything I had there - coffee, bread, soup!
YMMV

It was a nice change from Asian food to have lunch at this French style bakery cafe. Very reasonably priced sandwiches which were delicious, good breads, pastries and coffee. Could become a regular haunt if we were locals.
5
We grabbed a smoked salmon quiche and chocolate croissant. Both were delicious. I was sad that I felt stuffed at the time and could not try more of the delectable looking pastries. Will make a bee-line for the Boulangerie when I visit Singapore again.

organised a sat catch up with a group of friends. the food is reasonable with good coffee. most important the cafe was very spacious. but not so children friendly as they dont have baby chair. but overall good variety of food. must try is the chocolate tart

ABC has fast become one of my favourite bakeries and cafes in Singapore. Their bread and desserts especially their tarts and eclairs are delicious. Their sandwiches are good, not great but their breakfast options are wonderful. In particular I would recommend the Eggs Benedict which comes served on soft brioche bread with lovely hollandaise sauce. Their coffees are also good.Great place to stop by for a quick snack or to pick up some dessert for home

I like the concept of the cafe and the wide selection of food available. The staff are friendly and helpful. They politely reminded us to place our orders & payment before taking our seats. hahaha We always expect places such as this to take our orders. We ordered a lot of food (as per the pix attached). I ordered the Truffle Mushroom Risotto & I add on a Caesar salad; so yummy!!! I don't like duck but when I tasted the duck confit ordered by my friend; wow, the duck meat is soooo tender!!! Didn't really like the wagyu burger nor the ribeye steak. Oh, the salted caramel lava cake is to "die" for. Please leave space in your stomach for it. It's worth every calorie. I will definitely come back to this cafe and I especially wanna try the Shakshouka Skillet

Visited the Raffles Place outlet for a chicken sandwich and a Caesar salad. They currently have an offer where the total cost is just $10, so it's not bad value. Sandwich was decent but the salad was average at best. Best part was that there wasn't a line, unusual in Raffles Place area

It's a far cry from its first few months of opening. Today, the quality and standard of food is inconsistent such as hardened almond croissants, sour-off-tasting Paris Brest, unhygienic display of foods (there were flies inside the display windows in different occasions and days), stale baguettes. Not to mention they allow vendors to peddle the tissues and sorts inside their restaurant, turning itself like a hawker centre but with inflated prices.With the cafÃ© culture in Singapore neighbourhoods, booming, expanding and becoming more sophisticated in taste and creativity, you have better choices in food standard, quality of service and more comfortable ambience.A trip to ABC on several occasions, the service and restaurant hygiene (particularly at Killiney branch, their flagship and the very first restaurant it opened) has become so pathetic that you can get a better experience from McDonalds restaurant. The main floor was filthy with crumbled, crushed croissants and people were stepping all over it without the management noticing or taking initiative to clean it up. Not until we had complained to the 'manager' to clean it up that they did anything about it. It was difficult to miss though, as it was right beside the pay counter. Then recently they have had street-peddlers coming inside the restaurant to sell tissues and other sorts to the patrons. Very degrading... They've also stopped providing toothpicks to customers for them to sample cut up pieces of their baked goods - so people would use their dirty, filthy fingers to pick through them.It's a real shame what it has become..

One for early morning breakfast and the second for brunch. Situated within Vivo City this is a great stop off for refueling the cylinders prior or after the mall experience!The food is predominantly pastry based but with a wonderful variety, all fresh, tasty and well served by enthusiastic staff
5
The eggs benedict is great and there are fantastic bakery items. Nicely hidden away from the crazy Orchard road crowd, great calm getaway especially on a Sunday morning. Located on Killiney road nearest MRT is Somerset.The bakery items are really really good. Nice friendly service and you order and then seat yourself.Not to confuse this with Artisan Bakery which is completely separate near Tanjong Pagar
5
We are big on breakfasts and we were so lucky to come across this place. Their croissants are out of this world! We practically went here everyday not just for breakfast but also for afternoon coffee.
4
Located 5 minutes walk to Somerset MRT station, this is my favorite brunch place with relaxed atmosphere and reasonable price. Their freshly baked pastries are definitely worth a try, coupled with coffee and a book - and you have a great noon.

This boulangerie grew their menu organically. They started with basic bakery items like wonderful breads, croissants and gradually added other items. So they've recently added to their menu items like burgers, soups etc.Some of the best and juiciest hamburgers in the world, I've eaten in Paris. While this is called a wagyu burger, it's neither the juiciest nor the tastiest. I'd say it was disappointingly average.My friend had the salmon - which was done nicely, also average. And the professional chef among us had the risotto, which was decent.Still, I'm glad to have this place in the neighborhood

This cafe is great for a informal catch up with friends or even a business coffee.You have lots of pastries to choose from, or you can order a light lunch.I loved their banana and chocolate croissant today, delish!!! And the mocha wasn't bad either. A bit on the pricey side though, a tart is about $8
4
The location was convenient, just off Somerset. The cafe was aussie style with good ambience. We ordered Chicken Pie, Eggs Ben and Quinche for 2 persons and we were stuffed. The food was good but I didn't enjoy the ham on the Eggs Ben. Overall, a very nice place to chill and the crowds were not as scary as those in main Orchard Road

Light, fluffy, crumbly croissants any which way; classic, chocolate, ham & cheese. Cakes and pastries are done well here, especially the pear and almond cake.Coffee and service is ok but can be inconsistent. If you're fussy about your coffee, just be very specific about how you want it made, the standard is a bit milky for me so for a 3/4 cappuccino, order their piccolo latte instead. Also suggest you have any of the croissants heated, if you're dinning in, much nicer.The Killiney Rd store has a nice relaxed lounge feel. I haven't been to their other stores

A friend first introduced me to the main branch of ABC at killiney road. Very easy overlooked amidst all the other cafes and eateries around the area!I don't have perfect, discerning tastebuds for baked goods and coffee... but i know how to tell a bad croissant from a good one! :) And here at ABC their pastries and other breads indeed live up to the online raves. The rest of the food served is rather average and I wouldn't specially come back for the main courses.What brings me back here again and again, however, is the ambience of this place. Soft chill music in the background, cosy couches (and chairs too), and the lights that aren't too dim or too bright. As it is mostly a takeaway cafe, the place is not usually crowded or too noisy

I heard the raves about Artisan Boulangerie's croissants a while back, but have not had the chance to taste it till now - an appointment with a long-time business associate / friend brought me to Great World City and I thought I could finally put the compliments to the test.Artisan Boulangerie Co has several outlets in Singapore. I visited the one at 1 Kim Seng Promenade, #01-23 Great World City, Singapore 237994 (the number for this branch is 6887 4062). The bakery cafe offers a friendly setting with contemporary design, and hospitable service.The assortment of colorful eclairs were tempting too. Artisan Boulangerie Co offers generous samples, hence I helped myself to a piece of Cassis Eclair (SGD$4.50) - sweet and taut with a little hint of sour overture - I had been contemplating ordering it but found it a tad too sweet for my liking (odd that I used to have very sweet tooth!)In the end, I settled for their French Breakfast Set (SGD$12.90) and I added Smoked Salmon (SGD$6.00) to make it more complete. The French Breakfast Set comprises of a pastry of choice (I chose croissant, duh), a hot beverage and an orange juice. I felt a little cheated because the croissant costs only SGD$2.90 on its own, so did that mean I paid SGD$10.00 for my drinks?Anyway, petty grudges aside, I did enjoy my crispy sandwich that succumbed easily to the touch of the knife - it was flaky, very tasty with a sweet aroma and simply divine.The Smoked Salmon was smooth and had a very springy fresh kind of texture, so it was good to the mouth, teeth and tongue albeit being slightly too salty. I had been enjoying it until I still finding many tiny pieces of white fish bones within the smoked salmon itself, negating my overall salmon-eating experience. It was rather gross to be finding tiny bits of fish bones within the fish meat, really.For more detailed information and photos, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/05/lunch-at-artisan-boulangerie-co.htm

French bread and pastries is something I know well. I live in France. I visited Artisan Boulangerie Co. several times during my stay in Singapore as it would simply be impossible to try all the wonderful selection they offer at one go. It is exceptional to find such good quality products away from its source. No doubt that ABC is using the best quality ingredients combined with great talent. Quiches, pastries of all kinds, salads, great coffee and real French breads, all in a welcoming atmosphere. Does one need more

It's been a few months since I last visited this place and I must say, I'm still very much in love with its pastries and bread. Quality and taste remain excellent. Always a good place to chat over a nice cup of coffee with tasty sweets..
