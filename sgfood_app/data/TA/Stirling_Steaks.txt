The steak is juicy and great. Also, love the chargrill finish. Highly recommend for steaklovers.
The crispy king salmon is also very fresh. Absolutely adore it!

We ordered hamburgers (without mushrooms) chicken and steak (medium). Chicken was poor quality, steak too raw and burgers with mushrooms. Not recommendable!

It's really hard to find something good to say about our experience at Stirling steak.Ordered medium ribeye and it came rare (it is really not that hard to get it right). It was cold and the fries that came with it wasn't inspiring. The gravy was so cold that it was congealed.Have to ask for our drinks twice, food was served without cutleries and we were not the only customers that were complaining.Only saving grace was the meat was a good cut and flavourful. It was a pity that it was prepared badly

Stirling steaks is located in the Katong area which is lined with lots of cafes and restaurants. Among them are a number of steak places nearby such as the popular chain Aston’s and a little note upmarket (I.e. pricey),The Chop House. However, this little place holds its own, even in the midst of the competition. The place is simply renovated, wooden tables, simple metal chairs. Probably enough seating room for 20 or so people. The outdoor area is not so ideal as it’s along the busy road and down from the bus stop, so it can get pretty noisy and dusty. Plus no shelter if it rains. The steak menu is simple: a choice of charcoal grilled ribeyes, sirloins or the economical flank steaks. I tried the ribeye, which came with perfect doneness. The meat was quite tender, juicy and very flavourful. The steaks were served with a choice of truffle fries or mash and a side of salad.We also ordered the salad bowl and an order of the grilled watermelon, which is basically watermelon served with cheese. Both were only average. In conclusion, it serves more than decent steaks for the price, but the sides need more work. But hey, if steaks are what you came for, you won’t be disappointed

Service is slow, few people sitting down next to us left cause they had been waiting a while and it was difficult to get the waiters attention. This is the second time I’ve been here cause the steaks are decent but the experience is the same and don’t think I’ll bother going back

You can have a cheap steak here, or you have the best that the house has to offer. It all depends on how deep your pockets are. The steaks are cooked according to your preference and they somehow got it right. My medium-rare came with a slight drip of blood, which is exactly how I like it to be. Was here for Carvers & Co, but sadly they have shifted (some months ago) so I took to this alternative and I like it.Will be back for more steaks

Unlike high end places that served all kinds of steaks with cost a lot , the easy to understand affordable menu, order what you like, choose either sirloin, ribeye or Wagyu steak, comes a small side of salad and truffle fries, and the Belgian beer on tap was cold and delicious We ordered the ribeye 250g $33.90 and the archipelago Belgian beer $13.90 and only 10% service charge, no GST.

Stirling Steaks has a very simple 2-page menu - food on the front, drinks on the back. As its name suggests, its specialty is in steak.Just this month alone, I have already patronized the place twice; and I had the ribeye on both occasions. The steak is done to perfection - according to how you want it to be done (I ordered "medium") - and the sauce was pretty tasty too! You can choose either the truffle fries or the mashed to go with your steak. I happen to try both and I really liked the mashed a lot. As for the truffle fries, it's quite meh - but there's definitely room for improvement there! (The place also sells nice beer; I didn't have it but my friends who did told me it was good!)I made use of the Entertainer 1-for-1 promotion so it was really worth it. $30++ for TWO 200g ribeye steaks? HELL YEAH.Then again, without the Entertainer promotion, I think I will still come back here if I am craving to enjoy some good quality steak. Come to think about it, $30++ isn't too expensive for its quality

We were a group of sixteen or so ex-classmates that hadn't seen each other for many years, and in some cases for at least two decades. Our tummies were full, so we didn't get the opportunity to try out the menu offerings. Instead, we plonked for beers and good conversation. I'm sure we ended up loud, raucous, and probably turned some potential customers away by our behaviour. But I'd commend the restaurant not only for having a nice outdoor area where guys could be guys, but friendly and understanding staff. We certainly had a good time that night

We ordered the ribeye steak (medium rare) and it was excellently charcoal grilled. The charcoal taste was evident and brought out the best in it. The meat was succulent and tender, the truffle tries crispy and fragrant, and the mixed greens were crunchy and tasty. Overall one of the best beef steaks we have ever tried in Singapore, and we will definitely go back again. The boss told us they are shifting to the East area at the start of next month though
