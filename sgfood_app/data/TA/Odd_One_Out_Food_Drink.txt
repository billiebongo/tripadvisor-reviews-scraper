Right on the main drag of Orchard Rd, this delightful little restaurant is a welcome stop for a cold drink. The menu looked enticing yet I did not stay that long. Would certainly return to try it out more.

Hot nights needs cold ones to cool down and this place it’s the spot, great service and great vibe on this beautiful area.

After a day of exploring we decided to have dinner here. This place links to the Acid Bar, which has live music. The food was pretty good, I quite liked the Hawaiian pizza.I think what makes this place is the setting. It has a great atmosphere nestled in a side street with old school architecture. Pretty nice end to the day
1
Thought that I would pop in for a drink and a bite to eat while enjoying the Christmas lights along Orchard Road. The pizza we ordered was extremely disappointing - a small sized pizza with basically no taste and a “cardboard” base: and so over priced. Service was average and the drinks were ridiculously expensive. A sad end to our night.

Sitting outside under the fans at the bottom of Emerald Hill Road looking back up the old houses one way and the shiney madness of Orchard Road the other - so atmospheric. After a long walk from Bugis to Orchard Road this was the perfect spot for a sit down and bit of Calamares and Juice. Very good. The Manager was very friendly and came to talk to me which I really appreciated and made my evening. I really enjoyed it. More for the experience and setting than the actual food tho that was very good too. A good spot for a Beer I think

We had lunch here during our shopping marathon in Orchard road. The place is lovely and it is located in the colourful Peranakan Place Complex, very close to Orchard Rd tourist office.Food (nasi goreng + peranakan rice) was excellent, very tasty and the waiter did not complain when we asked to get all our food without garlic and onion due to food sensisivity. Along with our lunch he had a cool tiger beer and a delicious queen of bahia strawberry cocktail

Every time I come to Singapore, and the wife goes shopping with her sister in Orchard Road. Because I love shopping that much, I tell her I will be sitting here.Just opposite the Somerset MRT exit. Their sign says that Happy Hour is as long as Orchard Road.And for a laugh, you have to check out the signs at the hand dryers at the toilets
4
This little gem is well located with great priced food and drinks. After being shocked with hotel prices for drinks $18 for a Whiskey and dry it was fantastic to find this place. $6 for the same during happy hour. Their saying is "happy hour is as long as Orchard road
5
The food was simple and straightforward. The egg Benedict oozes out the egg yolk is a scene to die for.. also the nasi goreng... with satay and acar on the side... really mouth watering.
4
Nice restaurant. Price are reasonable. Food are nice. Today is cloudy day, so very comfortable for the outdoor city. City view for your dinning.
5
Went here for an afternoon late lunch. We had the fries with crab and chilli and chicken skins. Both absolutely delicious, washed down with the obligatory beers. A really nice, clean and friendly place.
5
Good food and friendly staff best in town happy hour price is best price in town. Will be coming back with my Friends!
5
Great place to end the day and with "just one more" beer to set you up for "tomorrow'
A good place to chill, to take you out of the city life for a while.
Great place to start and finish a trip to Singapore
5
Nice place to chill, take a smoke with outside sitting area and it's windy! Churros is good as well! To-go place in somerset area.
4
Great venue and excellent, attentive service from all the staff. Stopped in for afternoon drinks but it looks like the kind of place which can be quite a creative spot at night.

Last time I visited Singapore this was my favourite restaurant, just off Orchard Road serving a great mix of Asian & western food outdoors that tasted great washed by a local beer, perfect. Now whilst the setting is the same, the outdoor bar has gone to make way for more seating and only poor quality western food is served. A big disappointment, shame
3
Nice and friendly staff name sasi, but one thing poor wifi. Need to improve wifi since this location is a lot of traveler.
5
Great service and really good food. Spicy fried rice my favorite, along with fish & chips. And many other favorites. Happy hour till 7:00 is a plus
5
Had a very good service served by Dhana and Viswa. They were very friendly and very jovial. Glad to have staffs like them. Very good service and coorperativem
5
Excellent sevice provided by dhana and Vishwa ... Very friendly and jovial. Always available when needed. Great place to hangout with such wonderful person. Definetly will come again for Dhana
5
Excellent bar and staff especially Dhana was brilliant and very helpful. I would recommend anyone visiting Orchid road to pay a visit. Enjoyed the happy hour.
5
Good place to relax and have fun.. fast service and friendly customer service..
Food is good too! Would recommend to try this place out!
5
My girlfriends and I were served by Nina, she was great even though my friends and I were probably a pain. We had lots of fun, and items weren't overly priced, would definitely come back.
5
Suganan did a fantastic job. Never get bored even-though the person sitting opposite me keep on using his phone. Suganan approached and we were well entertained. Job well done suga. This is what real hospitality is!! Will definitely come back again.
5
Great service from Sasi, cold beers and chilled out vibes!
Located on a great traditional street which shows some of the old Singapore style
5
Warmly greeted by a staff named Jayne. She was very patient with me as I couldn't decide what to drink and waited for my order for around ten minutes. Her PR was so comforting and because of her, I'd gladly go back there and hope to be served by her again. Great job in training your staffs, keep it up
5
Delicious food with excellent service from staff Vishwa and team , outlet environment atmosphere is clean and decentDont miss to visit atleast once if you really expect good food with good serviceI recommend everyone can visit and share your review like what i did
5
Pleasantly surprised by this gem of a place in the heart of Orchard Road. The food menu is quite extensive. Food was good, service staff were friendly and helpful. The best thing about this place is its location and nice ambience to chill out with friends as well as people watch. Definitely be coming back again...
5
Convenient location and reasonable price of food and drinks.
Staffs are very approachable and friendly.
Ready to help costumer!!
Special Thanks to SASI kumar !!

First time coming over for drinks! There are afew bars nearby, but this bar opens early. Overall, good service and food! thumbs up!

Odd One Out • Food & Drink in Singapore's centre / Orchard Road is a the place for a good snack and cold drink.
5
Just in time before happy hour ends, managed to grab a few pints of great beers there with affordable pricing. Kind enough that the server let us get the "last call" before happy hour ends. We had a few snacks to go along with our beers, Traditional spiced satay, darn good hot wings, thin-crust pizza and ooooohh so darn good salted egg chicken to spiced me up with the beer! Overall, we had a great evening to start and a wonderful night to end with! Food was all good and service were all geared up! Fast, reliable and attentive staff you've got there even when its getting peak on a Friday evening. Shall be back again when its time to booze
2
Very unfriendly service, staff not interested at all in providing good service, this is a tourist trap! I can give only two points because the food was ok but nothing special. I will not come back for sure!
5
Odd one out's corner location and open air seating of one of the most vibrant areas of Singapore attracted me immediately. Its long side has opposite charming renovated old houses so it's a great place to sit and watch the world go by, and relax over a drink and a meal.I had initially gone in just to have a beer or two on the last day of my holiday, but when I saw the tempting food being served to other customers I got the menu and picked the satay.This was I am sure the nicest satay I have eaten anywhere-delicious meat, plenty skewers and a very tasty sauce.Service was also swift and helpful so full marks all round
3
We came across this bar in Orchard Road back in 1990 and after walking down Orchard Road and going into all the shops and Plazas a nice cold beer is what you need. This bar has changed over the years and we were quite surprised it is half of its previous size as a road was put in next to it . Had ginger,soy & honey chicken wings which were delicious plus crumbed calamari and a refreshing beer. Prices reasonable
4
Well located in the shopping spree area of Orchard.Stop here half way for a bite or end your afternoon with a cold drink.Happy hour from 12-7pm.Staff is friendly and attentive.Good to watch people as well.Emerald hill is around the corner..also very nice
4
After an excellent dinner in Crystal Jade Golden Palace we headed down Orchard road till Peranakan Place — home to a number of great bars. They have some good beer on tap — Kilkenny, Erdinger, Guiness...Good place to sip your brew and watch people go by on Orchard Road
5
Breezy al fresco bar with good happy hour prices! Happy hour is from 12 to 7pm. Ask for Marcus, he'll hook you up 👌
5
Lovely area to hang out in town, clean n nice ambient.
Reasonable pricing and variety of food choices.
Highly recommended area to chill at town.
5
The service is here very nice, especially for Sugunan and Nina!!! I'll definitely recommend my friends to come here to chill!!
5
Nina was great! The staff were warm and friendly. The food was good and the selection of alcohols was goo

It's a speak easy bar on the sides of orchard road. Even though there is traffic but you wouldn't be disturbed by that. Cool place where you can enjoy the music in background while chatting with your friends and enjoying your drink. Cocktails are usually good. Generally LIIT is good and beers are obviously better. Promotions are better at next door places and similar or better ambience. Good options are limited so if you want only good drinks and finger food then this is a good option. If you want to drink for a long time then explore places down the road.
4
The place did not look too appealing to us (four people) from the outside, but we were hungry and desperately wanted to have something to eat, and preferably very quickly. So we went in, found an empty table and were served by a friendly waitress. The menu had something for everyone, so we placed our order. Service was fast, and we got our dishes fairly fast. And yes, the food was much better than expected
1
This is one of the worst places I have ever visited in Singapore. I think it gets glowing reviews from visitors as it is one of the few visible places on Orchard to stop for a drink. If tourists took the trouble to explore- there are much better bars within a few hundred metres. The staff here don't really care, simply going through the motions, saving all their attention for the 'regulars' who tend to be ex-pats and their wives. Service is poor and very slow. Prices are high and the ambiance is poor. You feel you are sitting in a gold fish bowl! Avoid...there is better on offe
5
A fantastic bar with all the atmosphere you would want on the main road in central Singapore the staff is very helpful and you are never left wanting a drink Marcus was our waiter on our 3rd night and was helpful and even remembered the drinks when ordered on delayed supply to get the best from the offers available.All in all an excellent bar close to the road for atmosphere and the bird song at certain times is nice and adds to the vibrant atmosphere
5
We have been frequenting this place for sometime and the service and food here(spam fries and deep fried chicken skins and oh, satay sticks) are delish!!! Staff here have been very friendly and helpful(especially the ever so friendly and helpful Marcus :-)) who makes us feel at home whenever we drop by. Keep up the good work :-
5
A couple of friends went there for a catch up today, and our waiter Marcus was an absolute delight. Super friendly and was quite of adaptive of request
5
This is a fabulous place right on Orchard Road so an excellent place to eat drink and people watch The prices are very reasonable 9 Sing Dollars a pint
5
This is located at Emerald Hill orchard road. Please note that children are allowed here whilst not allowed inside pubs. Nice place for a quiet drink or two!
5
Came again last week, this time round with my poly friends! Really enjoyed ourselves! Service was good n friendly. Manager on duty diyana made everything so enjoyable and will come n visit again soon!
5
Nice place to drink outdoors. Nice staff (Emanuelle) and place is clean and friendly. Excellent for a pint on a hot day on Orchard road in singapore. Food is also excellent. Will come back.
5
Our waitress, Emmanuelle, was awesome! Prompt, friendly and personal service, always with a HUGE smile on her face.
1
Came for late dinner. Right at the beginning staff felf tired and not interested to serve on arrival. We sat down, got the menu and it took ages before order was taken. Since it was late there were only snacks available. So i ordered pizza which took like 25 minutes to be served. Maybe they forgot to punch the order or chef was very slow. There was nobody around to ask for anything, we were not the only ones waving trying to call someone over. No one to ask the bill too.Overall very disappointing venue in terms of service. Otherwise the restaurant was clean and had a nice atmosphere. The careless staff is a let down. Never again this place, sorry to say!
5
Service was prompt and quick, we wanted an outdoor smoking area which was given to us really quickly. Drinks came quick and were reasonably priced, had a G&T, Long Island and another cocktail. All came in pretty strong and delicious.Overall, decent place to chill for a bit and relax. Will return
5
Been here a few times with friends to relax and have a drink. It has a great outdoor atmosphere and depending on the time of the day, nice cool breeze. What is exceptional is the attentive service and our server Marcus (on more than one occasion) made sure we were well taken of.

Located right next to the busy traffic crossing between 313@Somerset and the Peranakan Place, Odd One Out draws the interest of curious passerbys. Decided to have dinner here with a colleague on a Wednesday evening and the food proved to be very good. Also the place didn't feel it was a squeeze although many of its tables were occupied. Did find the lighting just a tad bit dim when night fell. Overall, a good dining experience
5
Had good night out with some friends coupled with some smooth Guinness. Atmosphere was really chill, good crowd and fantastic service. Melissa was really attentive and is great at her job (needs a pay raise). Oh and the Luncheon Meat Sticks are AWESOME!!Definitely a must go spot to chillout and hang with good buddies.Overall experience definitely - A +++ !!!Keep it up ... ;

Yes this place attracts, right in the middle of the Orchard Road shopping voilence, this is heaven. Staff was kind enough to warn about exparation of happy hour and saved us some $$. Food was good and plentifull. Nice atmosphere, we'll be back. Average pricing.
5
Always feels like home, shoutout to #sugu for being MVP for the outlet! 4 years and counting brotha!! ❤️❤️

Whilst shopping on Orchard road we saw this place nestled amongst the shops and decided to stop to eat. I had a pasta dish and hubby fish n chips, they were both very tasty and filling. This place has a variety of foods on the menu and the staff were extremely friendly. How many times have we walked by and not stopped? Next time we are in Singapore and on Orchard road we will certainly be eating here again
5
We had tea here after a day of Christmas shopping.Marini was a waitress and she was fantastic with our 4 year old daughter.Food a bit pricy but your on Orchard Street so its to be expected.Food is excellent and its worth buying the 3 beer package that works out at a good price
5
Came for dinner few days ago... Ordered food and snack.. Drinks are good. Service was really great! Was served by manager Diyana. Sucha helpful,kind and friendly lady! Will definitely come back again:)
5
I ordered a burger and a rice. I enjoyed the food as well as the service. Was very pleased with the attentive service from one of the server, Chelsea. 👍🏼👍🏼
5
Perfect server and very good food
I recomend
Sugestion.... Australian Salmon with onions

Delicious food! Greeted by Chelsea, She has a warm smile and my orders were fast and efficient! Very chill! Thank you for having me!
5
A great place to chill. Very good customer service. Good food too. The supervisor Sugunan is very approachable and friendly. Im a happy customer.
5
Worth the Try! Strolling past the restaurants and stumbled upon this place and was greeted by this friendly staff Chelsea, gotta give it to her for this. I was recommended the crab cocktail and it was good! I'm definitely coming back here again! Not only for the food, but for her wonderful ever-friendly service too! Thank you girl :

My wife and I had a few drinks here last night. We made it just before their Happy Hour finished at 7pm. A pint of Tiger cost $11.65 but you need to buy 2. After 7pm the same beer costs $17.65. We drank a total of 5 pints and 5 glasses of Sav Blanc, which cost us $143.40. Lucky we got there just before 7 or it would of cost even more.The service was good and it's a pleasant place to drink and people watch. This is the most I've ever paid for a beer anywhere in the world. Go to New Zealand, for a far cheaper holiday
5
Passed by and decided to have some drinks and snack.. We wanted to try someLocal food and had a few recommendations from Diana the manager.. And yes her recommendations and food knowledge we great, we leave it to her to decide on what to eat! Drinks were fabulous and service was great! We had a good chat and getting alot of information about singapore and the local culture.. A great place to chill, fab food, drinks and of course, an exceptional service by the lady who knows how to keep her guests happy! Will be back again with friends and families! Thumbs up

Nice outdoor seating and great service from Marini with a big smile... food was average but company was grea

We were rather late out for dinner and stopped here as it looked like a good place to sit outside and relax. We ordered drinks, which took a while to arrive, then a burger and beer-battered fish and chips, which came quickly. They were both delicious. The lighting was a bit dim for my liking, but overall we enjoyed it, good to sit outside with ceiling fans rather than inside with the aircon on
