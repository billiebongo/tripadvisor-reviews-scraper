Good place for well prepared lunch by trainees at reasonable prices. Great view and quiet. Training ground from young adult that needs a life skill.

Nice serving with bread n chicken soup. Very creamy and nice temperature. Service was quick. Orders taken quickly too. Both mains cane with their own sauces. Served separately if you find it too tangy or creamy you can not take it. Chicken tends to be a bit dry but tasty. Value for money for a 3 course meal. Worth a try. Booked if you have a big group. Special menu for Friday evenings - buffet porridge.

Was looking for a nice place in Bukit Panjang for lunch with Husband. Location was in a school campus so is quiet n nice. Lots of greenery. Price is reasonable for set lunch. Car park is free. However not much in food selection , quality was just reasonable. Would say is a nice place to have a quiet set lunch with coffee n dessert, other than usual choices.
