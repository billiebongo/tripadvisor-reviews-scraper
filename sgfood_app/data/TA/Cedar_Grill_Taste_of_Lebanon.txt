Went with my husband looking forward to enjoy a nice meal of homus and lamb . There is another restaurant at this place - and no trace or knowledge of where it has gone too - or maybe just closed :(

Though being a vegetarian, I love exploring different country cuisine to such time it is vegetarian.Visited this place for the 1st time.Place is picture perfect... On the bank on the riverOrdered spicy hamus with pita bread... The hamus was superb and pita bread so soft and hot.Tried a salad which was fresh and refreshing.They had good happy hour combo as well.Surprisingly saw nearly 25+ vegetarian dish in such a restaurant.Visited over y more in the same week and tried egg plan mixed hamus which was simply outstanding.Singly recommend people who is ready to try different cuisines.. Will visit agai

In a nutshell - Not a very expensive restaurant located at one of the best locations in Singapore with very good food and excellent service. If you are an old customer, vegetarian options are limited but the service and location keeps bringing you back here. Perfect place to unwind after a long day at work. The restaurant gives the perfect view for fireworks and is the most underrated place for dinner on such occasions (eg New Year's Eve, National Day).

Excellent Lebanese food in a delightful setting on the water at Boat Quay. Everything was delicious...shish taouk, lamb chops (so tender!), hummus, etc. at very affordable (for Singapore!) prices. Happy hour prices on beer and selected mixed drinks were decent. Only complaint was that there were no specials on wine (least expensive glass was $14.00). Would definitely go bac

Had the best taste of lebanese food ever.... ordered the lamp chop and the mixed grill... it was fantastic!!! Accompanied with great ambience and and skyline at the Singapore River.... with the soft glow from the colourful middle easten pendants and the table cloths.. the evening turned out to be a really romantic one...

Went on a saturday evening. Outside was fully packed, so we were seated in level 2 bar. It was a low lighted, but beautiful room with cushion table. All the food we ordered were great. Drink wise the long island ice tea and singapore sling werent upto our expectation. May be because we have tried better ones in other bars. Service was good. Pricing was above above average, but worth it. Really enjoyed the night

This place along the Singapore River at Boat Quay serves the best Middle Eastern Food.. After trying a few other middle eastern restaurants, I had started believing that I dont like the cuisine as the kebabs are bland but this restaurant reassured me that the restaurants I had tried were not serving me the right food..!! A must go if you are a fan of kebabs/ middle eastern food.

I don't normally write reviews but this lovely place certainly deserves more praise. The service is fast and friendly, and -compliments to the chef - the food is amazing, bursting with flavours, and the lamb is sublime. Definitely worth a visit, - make sure you get a table on the water front

Cute little place along the river. Excellent hands on service where the owners are actually interested in whether you enjoyed the experience. All the details were correct. Fantastic and authentic salad fattoush with pomegranate. Proper Lebanese flavours. The sauces and chilli sauce was very good. And then arrived the lamb chops ... Perfectly cooked , moist and flavourful with a nice charcoal slight crusting. Great value for money; a rarity in singapore. Will go back and take our friends
