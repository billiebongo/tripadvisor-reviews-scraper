Nice ambience, cosy. Quality of the burger is superb! Reasonable price on food and beer. 25 on jug and 50 on tower. Definitely a great place to hang out with friends/family. I am even thinking of ordering burger for parties in future.

Good size burgers with a wide choice of variants. Some decent beer helps these down, and the service is usually pretty quick.

The have a good variety of burgers. Most patrons will rather go for the customizable option than the pre-selected ones. Was impressed with the additional sauces and ingredients you can add to your burger. Unfortunately, all burger meat (beef and lamb) were dry and lacked flavor. The pork and chicken were heavily seasoned and were too salty. Service was pretty quick. Hard to find parking space

It had renovations done and now named Fat Papas. First time going there built my own burger came out amazing and seeing what others ordered it looks like you will never leave still hungry. Also there is a secret menu not sure what that has on it but will find out.

Walked in restaurant after at 10.15 pm Thursday 9th of March , 2 of us sat down , FYI the restaurant entrance board still mentioned OPEN , just sat and open the menu only to be approached by filipino wait staff who rather then wishing even a simple greet of evening came and said THIS IS OUR LAST ORDER , wow ok agreed Our reply was we just opened the menu can we have 5 minutes and we will order at once and the reply was NO YOU ONLY HAVE TWO MINUTES Even the owner of the restaurant which I am sure she was not will not even answer in such tone to a customer , which was so insulting that me and my Friend decided rather not to dine and mentioned to her in that case it's ok we will cancel the dining to which her reply was THANK YOU This was so far the worst customer service reply No sorry no apology infact she thanked us to cancel the meal It was my first time to enter the door of this place and last time And for sure to all my friends Please if u don't wish to have rowdy service stay away from this placeAs for the managment please do see your CCTV to understand the fact clearly Hope it opens the eyes

Unfortunately a revised review of this establishment is necessary after our latest and sure to be last visit..Standards have certainly slipped dramatically in reference to the food which was insipid and flavourlessA significant reference to the service of the two Filipina women staff on hand whilst we were there. Incredibly abrupt and discourteous service, a shameful addition to the service industry..

There is an excellent selection of burgers and other American fast food. It may not be the healthiest but once in a while can't be bad for you. The signature burger is called a Fat B*****d which comes with all the trimmings - mega tasty. In squeaky clean Singapore it's maybe the last name one it expect it to be called though. My colleague ordered chicken and was well pleased to.Open fronted but with aircon. Basic style seating but comfortable enough. Good selection of drinks. Downside - no wifi available. Great place to eat - but probably not every night. Tried to submit this review and was told could not submit a review with profanities - maybe will have to change the name on your signature dish Fatboy!!!!

Fat Boys is one of the few places in Singapore where you can get a 'proper' burger. Options for carnivores and vegetarians alike they also have a 'build your own' menu so you can have exactly what you want. Delicious fries on the side and you're sorted. There are several branches all around Singapore.

This is my favourite place for a burger. I have tried the bolly wolly which is a lamb burger. My favourite burger is the big bello this is a vegetarian burger made with portabello mushroom , pineapple and carmalised onions. Simply superb. I never pass a chance to eat at Fatboy's
