As with trying anything new you are always a bit skeptical but Yayoi was good. The food was perfect and our party tried many different dishes. The tastes were excellent and great service for a quick meal before moving on. Give it a try.

Yes ok, my title is a little on the corny side. But I can't deny the food here was tasty, We came as a group of four colleagues for lunch, didn't have problems finding seating (it was a weekday), and the food didn't take long to come. There are many teishoku-style restaurants in Singapore, so it's difficult for one to really stand out. This restaurant is similar in that regard, but they do their best and I can't say I wasn't satisfied. I tried their pork toji teishoku which had sliced pork, pork cutlet, and breaded prawns, and came in a hot plate. And don't forget to try the shredded pickles that are available at every table - they may look very appetising but they are nice, and not overly sour

A colleague recommended this place so we dropped in for dinner. It was a quick and inexpensive meal. A meal for two came up to $37.We had the Buta Yakiniku and Gyu yakiniku sets, with both iced and hot green teas. The food was well presented in bento-like boxes, and the meat was of acceptble quality. Service was quick and ordering and asking for the bill via the machine ath the table was easy, though you still have to queue up at the cashier to pay

Have eaten lunch here several times, and the experience has been uniformly good. Mainly stayed with the ramen, though it isn't their speciality. Menu has lots of a la carte options, and if I ever feel hungry enough, will go back and try their rice-menu sets (Teishoku). Ordering is by iPad, service is efficient and fast, and food is fuss free at a reasonable price
