We went for dinner and thoroughly enjoyed great vegan food. The decor is modern and relaxing. Staff are very friendly and efficient. Cost very reasonable. We enjoyed it so much we went back 3 days later.

Had very high hopes after reading the reviewsâ€” but a let down. Food was good without Being exceptional.
Service was very average and spoilt the experience-/ prob the first and last time to eat here.
4
One of my fave go-to vegetarian restaurants if I feel a little rich. I have yet to taste something mediocre and I have been to the restaurant over 10 times. The Buah Keluak and Enchanted Forest are superb! Staff are attentive as well.

I have eaten here for the past 4 years but won't be coming back anymore after a recent experience. My family and I requested the waiters that less oil and salt be used to prepare our food, to which the staff nodded. The dishes appeared less than 10 minutes later with significant amounts of oil. It seemed to us that the food had already been pre-prepared and that the waiters were just providing lip service in agreeing to our request that the food be prepared with less oil and salt. Dietary requests are usually made based on a health need, and a restaurant that takes pride in its service would not have a blatant disregard for dietary requests from customers. They could have at the very least, made it clear that they would not be able to accommodate such requests.In terms of hygiene, the plates were clean but there were brown streaks on the cups. While Whole Earth are not known for their ambience, it was unacceptable that the cups were not clean.One of us requested to charge our phone to which a female waiter condescendingly and rudely replied "Can only charge for 10 minutes ah". As a Singaporean, I am fairly confident that they would not have said something like that had a white tourist made such a request.There were four of us and we ate for approximately $140, was a couple of extra cents in their electricity bill that significant to Whole Earth?Overall, I will maintain that the taste of the food is good, but nothing exceptional. They are not the only restaurant serving vegetarian penang rendang - it tastes exactly the same as Green Dot's. The service was a complete let-down at Whole Earth, considering the price of the food. They even charge for water. Whole Earth seem complacent with their Bib Gourmand when they are nothing more than an over-priced hawker centre with a so-called "healthy" tag

This restaurant has amazing service as well as food. The dishes were prepared very well and had imagination.I am picky about my food, and have very high expectations for a restaurant with good reviews that is vegetarian, let alone vegan. I was not disappointed. High marks for the mushroom dishes...
5
Whole Earth is a vegetarian restaurant in Singapore that offers traditional Singaporean/Malaysian cuisines. The food is tasty and the chefs have ensured that the authenticity of the flavours of their dishes. As someone who has tasted the non-vegetarian equivalents of these dishes in the past, I can say that the flavours are indeed authentic. The restaurant is very popular (even at lunchtime) and so, booking ahead is a good idea. Service can be a bit slow at peak times
5
I visited this place as it was near to where we were staying and I was not disappointed. Vegetarian restaurants are not usually my first choice, yet this is the kind of restaurant that could convince me to give them a go more often. The restaurant aims to encourage more people to eat a plant based diet and they do a pretty convincing job of it. The olive rice surpassed my expectations and was packed full of flavour. The tofu, sweet and sour was well balanced and the tofu itself had a good consistency as often it can be a little tasteless and soft. In fact all the dishes were delicious and the monkey head mushrooms were a great meat substitute. If I was being picky, the pumpkin and tofu dish was a little bland but perfectly ok. The restaurant itself was busy, simply decorated and very clean. The service was friendly and we did not feel rushed despite eating early evening in a busy restaurant. I ordered 4 different dishes and a small rice for two of us. In hindsight, this was too much as the portions are substantial. With water, Chinese tea, ginger beer, tax and service the bill totalled Sng$117. Great value, would return.
5
This restaurant is a real gem. It serves Peranakan food, but vegetarian. The dishes keep to the Peranakan flavors faithfully. Extremely creative, and just simply delightful to enjoy a hearty vegetarian meal with so much local flavor. It's a little pricey, but it is worth it. Can get crowded during dinner, so do reserve in advance
4
Whole Earth has an extensive menu, which can make it truly difficult to decide what to get! We ordered a bunch of different things to share: Tom Yum Soup, a Mushroom Tempura like starter, Sweet & Sour Delight, Olive Rice, Nonya Potato curry, and Broccoli-Monkey Mushroom head stir fry. The food was incredibly good - great flavours and textures, good portion sizes. I will definitely go back
5
Went there for dinner. A mix of Peranakan and Thai. The food they have is very good. Must try the Buah Keluak and tom yum soup. The atmosphere is also very pleasant. Easy to reach and while the food is slightly on the high side, it is worth it. Definitely a must if you are vegetarian or vegan
5
Out of the ordinary menu drew me in, was also after something fairly healthy after days of eating lots of meat and fish. Food was quick and tasty. Loved the mushroom
5
All plant based food - amazing flavours and textures - recommend the Rendang. If you want to see what is possible with plant based cooking this is the place to go to
4
This restaurant offers the best vegetarian food I've tried till date. The food is tasty and the dishes were well executed.
4
Good to see so many locals at an all vegetarian restaurant...the chef experiments with Interesting items such as monkey head mushrooms and also different fusions...not all things turn out as successful but it is great that it is being tried...
3
If you are in the area and you feel like going meatless, this vegan restaurant serves some local cruisine like rendang, ngoh hiong.
We tried the trademark Olive fried rice too.
Pricing is slightly high, and there is a open carpark just across it.
4
was travelling on business with a Vegan friend, we're often hard pressed to find something that can keep everyone happy, this did the trick, not a meat dish in sight but you never felt like you were missing the beef or pork, lovely meal, great invention, highly recommended
5
Recommended bynthe Michelin guide to Singapore, this place doesn't disappoint. Went with 4 carnivores and everyone was pleastenly surprised. Tasty, healthy vegetarian food cooked Peranakan style. No mock meat is used here, just very creative dishes with vegetables and tofu. Delicious nyona curry, Tom yum soup, rendang. The price is a bit expensive but it's worth it
5
This place was a lucky find! My husband and I went there for lunch two times within the 4 days trip to Singapore. The food is seriously delicious and, for us westerners, very diverse from the other vegetarian restaurants we had been before. I highly recommend getting the olive brown rice small portion and one more dish if you are a party of two, because that's plenty. Our favorite dish was the "love at first bite"! But honestly that olive rice was one of the best type of rices I've ever had; it was perfectly cooked
4
The food definitely takes on the influence of local cuisine - in particular the nonya/peranekan. It's spicy and delicious and a standout is the fusion xo rice. We also had an sambas eggplant and beans and Tempe - both very goodSo no complaints about the foodService is strangely Singapore - neat, mildly attentive but somehow lacks enthusiasm - but it's not badDecor and atmosphere, it's not date night. The decor is acceptable and neat/tidy but it misses the mark on being on trend. It's brightly lit , so that's a buzz kill for a date, and the music makes me think I'm trapped in an elevatorIn terms of atmosphere - it's like being in space.... or low orbit. A nearly complete absence of atmosphere Good for the food
5
This michelin star plant-based restaurant provided us with a variety of dishes of very different tastes. One dish per person may be a bit tight, but we were 4 and ordered 5 dishes + white rice and it was more than enough.The menu has great variety, some preparations with uncanny resemblance in texture and appearance to chicken. Excellent option for veggie fans as well as meat fans. It is not cheap, water is charged (but refilled free) and they close early (last order 9.30pm). It is not a big place, so maybe make a reservation
5
This place is a haven for vegetarians. Try their Rendang curry, olive brown rice and butter chicken (vegetarian). I also like their lemongrass drink. Very refreshing.
4
Tastes are good and the menu full of interesting options. However, the portions were quite small, especially for the price. Pluses: vegetarian, brown rice.
5
Best Asian vegetarian I have ever eaten, truly impressed with the food, very innovative dishes with vegetarian meat dishes, the chicken actually tasted like real chicken ðŸ˜‰
4
Vegetarian (Vegan) restaurant with very tasty food, excellent variety. Clean and bright. Pleasant wait staff.
4
Wholesome, vegetarian delicious food. I loved this restaurant. Was glad that I went with some colleagues who already knew what to order.
Will definitely be visiting this restaurant again. I also loved the location not far from the city center and close to the MRT
4
Don't get mixed up with Chiangmai (Thailand)'s iconic Good Earth Restaurant for roving gourmets.Whole Earth is another "must-try" Singaporean version. A total regret indeed if one should miss out the fantastic creation of "beef rendang" in spicy coconut milk and bits and the stirred fried "kailan" in lemon grass and fiery chilly padi comlimented with the thick icy serving of cala mansi fresh juice! Customer service is less cordial and perthan its true Thai version in Chiangmai's Good Earth.
5
Looking for a place to have dinner on a Sunday night at 7.30 pm where most kitchens closes at 7 was a challenge in Tanjong Pagar area. Whole Earth with its welcoming lights attracted me. Lo and behold it was a family type restaurant where you share dishes. It was hard to decide what to eat and everything in the menu looked good. They do have portions for single and that helped. The staff kindly helped me to choose dishes for one person. I ended up having their signature soup and fried rice. The after taste of the meal still lingering in my palate till bedtime tells me I had a great dinner!
5
Fantastic, healthy and one of a kind thai Peranakan vegetarian food in town! Though the food is pricey, it is the or one of the very best vegetarian restaurants in Singapore. Must-try dishes are: Penang Rendang, Kang kong, olive fried rice, teriyaki mushroom, and cereal tofu! Portions are generous and the food is consistently so very tasty :
2
Yes, food tastes good. A meal for two, two mains and drinks will cost you 50-70 dollars. Not worth it. Would I go back hmmm.I really like to support a vegetarian restaurant! Becase the world needs more of them. But what I can't understand is why this place is so bloody expensive! I mean, it's not really organic, the interior looks like a canteen, and the feels like a business more than a place with any soul.A plain small bowl of rice 2.50SGD THEY WILL ADD GST AND SERVICE CHARGE! A standard dish avrages around 20SGD plus plus!Place is super clean though
3
Tasty dishes - rendang was delicious and the yam treasure ring was so tasty - crusty on the outside with soft melt-in-your-mouth yam paste. One won't believe that the dishes are vegetarian. The seasoning and sauces used were flavourful. The olive rice was a tad salty
4
Convenient location within 3 mins walk from Tanjong Pagar MRT station. Food is good, but quite pricey & small serving size. The veg pickes, fried seaweed, rendang & the pulut hitam dessert is the must try.
4
Good food and I especially like the fried mushroom and rendang dish. The fried kangkong is also good.
Price is a bit on the high side. ordered 4 dishes and cost me about SGD$120.
4
Good Food, Home Cooked Comfort Soups And Generally Pleasant Though A Tinge Pricey. Staff Friendly .Closes Early at 9 .30 p.m. Quiet Place at Peak Seah Road.
5
Being Malaysian, I love my Peranakan meals but it's always been with meat as the mainstay. Dining at Whole Earth was a pleasant introduction to Vegetarian Peranakan cuisine. The food was taste and portions adequate. I'd definitely go bacl.
4
I'm not a vegetarian but some friends are, so we often try vegetarian restaurant together and this time it's really nice that I want to write a review. To start off, we ordered signature fried olive brown rice, rendang, crispy oatmeal tofu, honey ribs, yam treasure ring, steamed premium shitake mushroom with chef's special stuffing... pleeentty!!For drinks, try their home made sour plum.
4
Many of colleagues being vegetarian we decided to go for dinner to this place. The name & picture on the menu card looked creative with names and presentation as non vegetarian dishes. We thoroughly enjoyed every bit of it right from appetiser to dessert. Strongly recommend this place for the variety and certainly for the change it provides. Food looked healthy and tasted very good. My pick of the dish was the Olive brown rice. Prices are slightly on the higher side but is worth visiting for a change.
3
Had dinner with my wife here yesterday. We ordered the nonya curry, sambal kangkong and oatmeal dofu. Food was pretty good. Service was slightly above average. No complains, but also nothing to rave about. However, the prices are just ridiculous. We paid $72 for the two of us. A glass of water is $0.50 and if you think that is bad, a bowl of steamed white rice is $2.50!!! That is beyond ridiculous. While the food is good, we will certainly not go back as the price simply can't justify the experience
5
Whole Earth has an extensive menu, with dishes referring to traditional (i mean non vegetarian) dish names, which makes the food choice easy. The food itself tastes very good, balanced seasoned and in generous serving sizes. We had an excellent lunch there. Staff is friendly and helped us chosing the proper amount of food, although we still took home some leftovers. Definetly we will be back to this place to try different options from the menu.
2
Not my first visit here but will be my last. The food's genuinely good - you won't believe you're not eating meat. The rendang is always my favourite but a tad spicy. In fact, most of their popular dishes are chilli-based which comes at no surprise given that they're a 'nonya/thai' restaurant. My only gripe is the prices. A dinner for two - olive rice, penang rendang and oatmeal monkeyhead (mushroom) nuggets - came up to over S$60. This, in a restaurant with the ambience of an airconditioned canteen. And did I mention that a glass of plain water costs S$0.50, no refills
4
Good quality and many options in the menu. I often take the Beef redang and the Nonya curry. They have different types of rice style to go with the food. I love the olive one. I recommend this restaurant but come on time since last order is at 9:15 if my memory is correct and there is no flexibility
4
Although this is a Perenakan restaurant there was a great selection of dishes for different cuisines from south east Asia. The mock meat dishes were superb and I would recommend the chefs speciality dishes. Friendly and quick service.
4
We went there solely for the purpose of trying vegan Peranakan dishes, though the restaurant serves Chinese, western and Thai food as well (all vegan). Food was delish! However, the prices were a bit high for the amount they served us..
5
My friend took us here last year for a catch up lunch. Food was very tasty and memorable. Will revisit. We had a variety of dishes which included their 'beef rendang ' which tasted very authentic.
4
If there was a choice of 3.5 stars, I would have awarded that for this restaurant as "very good" would not be the adjective I would use. However, it is novel, innovative and fills a much needed niche for peranakan vegetarian tastes. For this, it deserves the additional half a star.Plus points- fresh ingredients - we ordered 6 dishes and found the ingredients to be fresh and of good quality. The mushrooms used in those dishes we tasted (shitake, monkey head) were mainly rehydrated. The black fungus were of good quality. The brocoli and monkey head mushroom dish, olive rice and long beans with tempeh were all very good. - contrary to other reviews, I thought the price was reasonable. just because there is no meat doesn't mean that it should be cheaper. Good quality ingredients are costly and we want and hope that the restaurant use vegetables from good sources.- the variety is good and even the dishes do taste different instead of being a variation of each other. The Chinese style options avoid all the mock meat renditions you find in Chinese restaurants.- service was brisk and efficient.downsides- though it markets itself as a thai peranakan restaurant, there is hardly any thai options and the peranakan options are "weak" in taste in comparison to the more Chinese options. The spices used in the two peranankan options we tried were heavy without being fragrant - something you would expect in peranakan food. The buah keluat dish was really not up to mark. For vegetarians who have not experienced peranakan food, it is okay but for those who know the freshness of lime, torch ginger, lemongrass, young ginger, galangal, chillies and tumeric - you will be hard pressed to find the same flavours here. This was a major disappointment for me.The penang rendang was touted to be good but we were disappointed. It didn't have the freshness we expected. It tasted tired and the mushrooms were chewy. It is also disappointing not to find more use being made of tempeh - the star of any south east asian vegetarian option.- as for the Thai flavours - I expect to see salads that thai peranakan is famed for but sadly no. - My friend was excited at seeing the cereal tofu dish as cereal prawn was something he liked when he was non-vegetarian but the Wholeearth's interpretation was insipid and lack lustre.- the pumpkin dessert was a gooey mess. this could be a personal taste but I just took one mouthful and left the rest. This is such a let down as desserts are vegetarian - it shouldn't be difficult to get it right.Generally, if you are vegan, you really don't have many good options apart from indian vegetarian in Singapore. So Whole earth is a good option. However, if you are omnivorous and have a good sense of the fragrance and the flavour explosion of peranakan and Thai food, this is a very poor interpretation. Note that the flavour that is missing is not the meat - but it clearly shows a lack of insight into the core of thai and peranakan cooking. The art is less in the spices but in the freshness of the herbs. This is sorely missing in Whole earth. We do need good vegetarian options in Singapore, so, i hope the owners will take this feedback on board.If the owners/chef are interested in improvement, I recommend that they make a trip to dine at Anotai in Bangkok. This is a Thai vegan restaurant that serves superb food without compromising on the Umame that Thai food is famous for.

With so much veggie food it was so difficult to know what to choose! I ended up having an 8 hour cooked curry with potatoes and shitake mushroom. The 'mushrooms' were very strange and seemed more like a soy protein than an actual mushroom, however the food was very tasty, full of flavour, nice and spicy with perfectly cooked brown rice. We arrived at about 9PM and felt like the staff wanted to get rid of us as they were closing shortly afterwards, which was a shame
5
So this place has great vegetarian food. There are all these golden mushrooms and freshly cooked vegetable dishes - i.e you know you are eating vegetables e.g. jade cabbage; bitter gourd etc . Then they have the thai curry etc meals etc and then the wonderful peranakan dishes such as nutty buah keluar should my friends tasted salty but I thought it would be creamy. The place is big and airy. All in all a good place to come
5
A friend arranged a dinner at this restaurant - and we almost cancelled (what carnovore wants to go to a vegetarian restaurant?)I was blown away. The food was superb. Everything we ordered was excellent. My favourites were the Oatmeal Tofu, braised mushrooms with broccoli, and the Rendang. (see photos)I was so impressed that I brought another group of friends there the next week!The decor of the restaurant was not much to talk about - plain tables. Good aircon. But I guess its the food that counts!Average meal cost was around $30 a head
3
This is an above average price range vegetarian restaurant, its location is just above Tg Pagar MRT station. I think it is the only vegetarian restaurant that specialize in Panakaran vegetarian cuisine. The food is average, but i felt it is overprice, maybe it is due to the central location. Good ambience too
4
The restaurant servers vegetarian meals which actually tastes like meat. Instead of just using flour, which is fattening, they use other food to replace (like mushrooms). I strongly recommend this place for everybody to try, vegetarian or not. Trust me, you will love it!1 fallback: The meals are expensive. Standing at over $20 per dish, vegetarian restaurants in Singapore are very expensive. If you're looking for somewhere economic, maybe you'll need to find vegetarian food at a hawker centre or food court
4
A very interesting concept. Where vegetable actually taste like meat! It was very unusual to eat "butter chicken" and "sweet and sour", it was so convincing initially I felt like I had been lied to! haha, amazing kitchen to be able to replicate all these flavours I was super impressed. Not 5 stars because I do believe its on the expensive side, I wouldnt class this restaurant luxury/gourmet, therefore, I could not justify the bill... Thank you for your hospitality and I am sure I will return a third time
5
It's a big place with long menu. Everybody can easily find good food. The fusion dishes are great. Must try.
5
Nice yummy spicey food, but pricey, it is very nice peranakan malacca vegetarian restaurant, with convenient parkings and close to metro station
5
The Restaurant serves Thai and Nonya Vegetarian Cuisine. The foods are well prepared and tastes are great.
4
While this is pricey by Singapore standards, the food is really good and it may be the only place on earth where you can get vegetarian buah keluak - a taste sensation I had not heard of. Plenty of other really tasty dishes as well.
4
It is typically local veggie delight. I visited today with client who is vegetarian. But food is not that much delicious compare to other veggie restaurant. overall is okay.
3
So this place knows it is one of the few establishments that can boast full vegetarian south east asian cuisine in singapore and possibly uses that to be complacent in terms of staff and help.we ordered some options, and they were pretty good, i will give them that, that stated, the portions are small. also they dont customise your food at all. for the money you pay, customization shouldnt be an issue. so all in all, perhaps not worth your buck, go to this place if you are out of options and need something they specifically cater to
5
Whole earth is a not-so-recent addition to the Singapore vegetarian scene and I am completely taken by it. Friendly staff and great food are the orders of the day. The food is in an interesting vegetarian Peranakan style and is so authentic that some Peranakan friends are extremely impressed. Besides the rather bland decor and occasionally sedated service, this is one vegetarian restaurant which is a must try for vegetarian and non-vegetarian alike.
4
Great menu! I've been traveling in Asia quite long and I found this place is the best for vegetarians! Truly! The menu is huge! Really difficult what you want to try because everything looks and sounds just great! I feel in love with their mushrooms also the energy ,detox ,something drink is really interesting too. 4 stars just because it was quite expensive
4
We first passed this restaurant in a tropical downpour and ringed by construction sites. The menu was interesting and we returned to dine. The references to meat in the names of some dishes containing none (e.g. sharkfin soup, pork ribs) might be a little confusing or disconcerting to vegetarians!However, after speaking to the staff it was clear that there was no meat to be seen, and no alcohol in the restaurant. The decor was spartan, but spotless and the staff attentive.The meal that followed was memorable. I had Penang Rendang accompanied by brown rice with olives. It was spectacular, with the probably long marinated and slow-cooked mushroom comprising the meal indistinguishable in texture from beef. The flavour was also true to the origins of the dish. The brown rice was excellent with a firm texture, clearly separated grains, and nice olive flavour - none of the usual jasmine rice here. My wife had the Nyonya curry - bean curd wrapped in seaweed. Excellent. There was obviously some 'secret' ingredients and/or preparation involved in many of the dishes, and the menu alluded to fermentation and slow-cooking .Dessert was amazing. Being used to sticky syrupy glutinous rice, I was taken aback by the delicate flavours and texture of the homemade Nonyan glutinous rice with pumpkin and coconut milk. The sweet pumpkin was the dominant ingredient. I snaffled some of my wife's Japanese koniyaku red tea jelly with longan. Again, a wonderful marriage of flavours, with fresh longan.Downsides: most of the drinks were a little too sweet for our taste, such as the flavoursome 8-treasure cooling tea, and the hot lemongrass tea.The bill for two people (three main dishes, drinks, and dessert came to a little under SGD90
5
Wasn't sure on 4 or 5 stars, but decided on 5 due to the amazing variety of dishes. Where else can you get multiple Peranakan vegetarian options! Of course, the more one strays from standard Thai vegetable type vegetarian dishes, the more risk of how much one likes the dish. But go ahead and take risks here, it's overall well worth it
5
A first for me to have peranakan/Thai cuisine made for the leaf eaters. The food is simply amazing! Rich in flavors and aroma. Loved it
4
We went with our vegetarian business associates from Malaysia. We wanted to give our guest an experience with good vegetarian food. We can only say good things about this restaurant from good service to good food.
5
Rendang beef, brown rice, sambal petai .... were brilliant. Unusual to have Peranakan dishes featured with all-vegetables. Wish a 2nd outlet can open soon.
4
Asian style vegetarian restaurant i.e. no pasta etc. Bean curd, mushrooms, veggies and nuts are turned into wonderfully fragrant meals that in some cases you can barely believe are vegetarian. The flavours are mostly Thai/Malay influenced. We especially loved the Penang Rendang (spicy, aromatic), and their nonya golden pumpkin and glutinous rice desert. Meals were generous, flavoursome, healthy. Service was attentive and helpful (explaining the flavours and spiciness, giving suggestions). A great midrange restaurant (just don't expect or bring any alcohol, and the decor is very simple)
3
After reading all the reviews we were encouraged to visit as I so wanted to try some of the local foods. We had the Redang curry & Assam Pedas. We found both good in taste but the bean curd to create a mock taste was a little funny. I would have it again. It was great to try. The Penang Rendang was great. Again a heavy & substantial dish which was too much like meat us to enjoy it !! Weird but true. We also had the King Sambhal which was fantastic & I would order again except for the Perari petal beans in the Sambhal. Beware these beans whisky being v good for your health are also known as stinky beans & smell on you for days !!! Whilst I would use this resturant once in a trip I'm looking toward to visiting again on my next trip. Service was fair it's a busy cafe type of place we had to ask for attention each time. However the waitress was most pleasant & helpful.
4
I have been there twice and the food is tasty. Every time if i out with my Vegetarian friends, i will recommend this place even the price is a bit more expensive then Non-Vegan restaurant. I ordered meals for 2 person; 1 sweet & sour, 2 bowl of soup, 2 bowl of brown rice and 2 glassed of drinks and it cost us $90+
5
I ordered a couple of dishes, and they were all excellent. The most memorable dish that I had was the rendang. It tasted better than most rendang out there that is cooked with meat. And mind you, I am an avid rendang fan. The next dish that left me a deep impression was the thai battered mushrooms. Never have I ever tasted mushrooms that were cooked till they are so light and crisp. Definitely worth it to order. I also ordered the XO rice which was simple in texture, yet flavourful at the same time
3
Ordered rendang - very good, but portion is small for 19sgd.Sweet Sour was no good, like chewing on something a bit tough and too sweet. Suggest not to try even tough they are in the recommended list.Olive rice is goodWolfberry soup is very good. Recommended.Braised monkey head mushrooms with brocolli is good. Recommended.Drinks are pretty pricey (3++ and above).Steam mushroom is also nice.Location is very near to Tanjung Pagar MRT exit A. It wasn't full house for a dinner on Monday evening. However the design of the restaurant somehow cause the place to be noisy.Two phillipines service person is very courteous. But the Chinese lady is a bit rude. Perhaps because we stayed until they are about to close. She handed the bill without me asking and also reminded us that we need to leave as they are closing. I think perhaps partly is our fault for staying late.
5
We went for a business lunch as one of our party was vegan. I personally like vegetarian food, but a few in our group were skeptical. We all walked out satisfied and couldn't stoop commenting on how tasty the food is. Some of the dishes taste so "meaty" that you'd really think you were eating a lovely lamb curry. So many vegetarian restaurants try to create imitation meats, which often end up tasting like you're chewing on a soggy piece of cardboard. At Whole Earth they have it down to an art, really yummy.I'll be back
1
quality does not match up to the price. not recommended. had assaym pedas. first and last time coming here. food portion small. white rice terrible. not quality food cheap hocker food at 5 star prices. If u don't mind paying for rental and location it's ok but there are many more good vegetarian food at fortune centre with aircon
5
Great food and drink experience. This place is specialized in thai and peranakan kitchen. Will come back again soon. Thanks!
5
We were invited to this vegetarian restaurant by an old classmate who is a vegetarian. We were very pleasantly surprised by how good the food tastes. Quite an expensive lunch but the food was delicious. A very pleasant experience.
4
Had the Penang Redang, the Sambal King and the Fried Hong Kong Noodles to share...
Washed it down with the fresh lemongrass drink.
Everything here was fabulous... especially the spicy Sambal King dish... really enjoyed it - great lunch spot...
4
Went to this restaurant with a friend and was amazed with how delicious the food was. You must try the rendang and the sambal king. The favors are amazing and the food so tasty I will definitely be back for more.
4
My wife and I would like to try different vegetarian cuisine so we found this Thai & Nyonya theme restaurant. The restaurant is pretty spacious considering it's in CBD area. Car parking is easy, there is a METRO operated carpark right opposite the restaurant charging $0.50/half an hour for evening. Dishes are well presented however it's quite pricey especially some of the dishes are no different from other Chinese Restaurant. We ordered Nutty Buah Keluak, Imperial Beauty Soup (NICE! Must try too), Monkeyhead Mushroom, Thai Mango & Tamarind Fish + 2 desserts. Total meal for 2 costs around $100 (which is why I said it's pricey). Good for people who would like to try out different cuisine once in a while. But if you ask me, I wouldn't go second time
5
Had not eaten in a vegetarian restaurant for some time but was pleasantly surprised by the quality and taste of the food here. Judging by the fact that alms every table was occupied for lunch many others felt the same way. There is a wide selection of foods available including spicy dishes. The restaurant is also almost at the door of an MRT station so very convenient for anyone in Singapore
5
We have eaten at vegetarian restaurants the world over and this is certainly up there with the best of them! Great selection and fantastic flavours and textures. Very polite and attentive staff.We noted that some reviewers thought it was pricey. Well. It's certainly not expensive by Australian standards and we felt proportional to the quality. However, it is quite pricey by hawker Singaporean standards. We thought it was definitely worth the price
5
Husband made dinner reservation for us and our baby. When we arrived, the baby chair was already set up. On top of that, we were provided with baby plate and utensils too. Thumbs up for good service. Though delicious vegetarian meals have becoming increasingly easy to find in Singapore in recent years,we seldom come across restaurants offering vegetarian Peranakan food. We (my husband and I) tried Sambal Kang Kong, Oatmeal Tofu and Nutty Buah Keluak. I was most excited about Buah Keluak because that was the most authentic and tasty peranakan food I have ever had. We were hoping that the dishes won't be overly oily, and I think the chef at Whole Earth did a pretty good job because they did not taste oily (though the Sambal Kang Kong looked so). The Oatmeal Tofu was tastefully seasoned till the point that one would be dying to want more. Price wise, it is a bit pricer than many vegetarian restaurants. But, we felt that the taste somewhat compensated for the price

Wish I didn't have to give four stars as everything about this restaurant is calculated to annoy - the self-conscious neurotic eaters, the chilly aircon, the ridiculous New Age menu (beauty enzyme essence drink anyone?), the strictly advised but then not enforced 30 cent charge for water, the S$18 special rice. The prices, oh the prices. And the portion size even for a S$30+ lunch left me wanting to go to Maxwell Hawker Centre to fill up afterwards. But despite all of that, the food is extraordinary. One of the sadnesses of being veggie is not being able to try classics like Rendang - but these guys made a version with chewy, meaty mushrooms that fills all your atavistic instincts to tear and chew protein, whilst pulling off delicate and spicy at the same time. Wow

Lovely lovely tasty and fresh vegetarian food, no shortcuts used here... Went there twice, first time was a lovely surprise as we stumbled upon this place. Back home i was thinking of the penang rendang we had here for months... so once I had another chance, I wanted to come back for more. 2nd time around we also tried the monkeyhead mushroom teriyaki, which was great too. Ambience is modern and clean, but not very cozy..

Tried a great selection of dishes, all very delicious and vegetarian. It is always great to try food that doesn't descend too far in the mock-meat direction, tastes great and is unique.

I was at the restaurant for a family dinner with 7 other people. Some of us loved the food while some of us left feeling dissatisfied. We had ordered a variety of dishes and the one I loved was the Tom Yam Soup albeit its spice level can be a put-off for many. The other dishes I really liked were the cereal toufu, the sambal kang kong, pineapple fried rice and the sweet and sour fish. Their lemongrass drink was lovely but it is a pity that they charge for water when their food is generally quite spicy. As the other reviewers have mentioned, the cost is definitely on the higher side

Having lived as a vegetarian in Singapore for over two years, I'd say Whole Earth is definitely the best vegetarian restaurant in town for people with a taste for spicy food. Their tom yum soup is absolutely amazing (although quite spicy). The nutty buah keluak is a rare vegetarian version of an Indonesian candle nut dish that's typically made with chicken. Both their sambal king and sambal kang kong are excellent, although on the spicy side. Consider adding their lemongrass drink to help calm the spice

When you do vegetarian for spiritual reasons, taste is unimportant. In this case, this vegetarian does not make you feel like eating grass or those oily gluten mock tofu and soya stuff. It is a nice spicy blend of Thai and Nyonya, and their creative use of mushrooms and lots of fresh vegetables and beans, rather than mock gluten makes it feel healthier. My favorite dishes are Penang Rendang and Sambal King, hot lemongrass tea. Simple decor but above average prices. Lunch easily sgd30 per pax. On first and fifteenth of each lunar moon, place is packed so you have to book

While I could rant about the food in this place for some time, the problem with Whole Earth is they are pricing their dishes much too high, with a quick scan of other reviews showing this to be a major issue with most people. It's friendly, clean and bright but isn't any type of upscale vegan restaurant that could justify such prices, and while the dishes and flavours were outstanding, they were a little on the small size and required ordering a few of them. I hope the ownership takes note and can work out some way to deal with this as I would love to recommend them for more than just their delicious and flavourful creations

My family of four had dinner last week and took the set dinner which comes with soup, two dishes of veg and a desert for about 70 per pax. excluding tax. The service was good and food was average to good though its a bit pricey

Whole Earth is possibly the only restaurant in the world that serves authentic, vegetarian Peranakan cuisine, along with Thai cuisine. So they get an A+ for this. The place is a bit away from the center in a quiet neighborhood, close to the excellent Red Dot Museum. The menu is very interesting, but could do with better explanation of each dish. The Tom Yam soup was out of this world and clearly the best I have had any where. So also the olive rice, along with the special enzyme drink. However, the other 2 dishes we ordered (don't remember the names) looked like mock meat and was a total put off without even a bite. The pictures in the menu did not suggest this. After a bite of each, I just could not get myself to eating any more due to the look, the texture and the strange flavor, all reminiscent of meat, even though I have never eaten it. My suggestion is to ask the wait staff for a detailed description of each dish you wish to order, and make sure it does not end up resembling a mock meat item

Usually when you tell others that you're going for vegetarian food, people would assume that you're either going for gluteny stuff (mostly found in economic vegetarian beehoon stalls) or salads. Well, neither of those are the case at The Whole Earth. Very little gluten is used here, and the food is decidedly Asian, with liberal usage of spices in their dishes. I was told that they use traditional methods of cooking their sauces, which gives the food more depth and flavour. No use of pre-prepared spice packs here. Think hours of cutting, pounding, mixing and boiling...We ordered the house specialties: Penang rendang, sweet and sour delight, deep fried oyster mushroom and olive fried rice.The Penang rendang sauce was thick and pungent with spices, while the "meat" was made of mushroom stems. The texture was surprisingly meaty, for lack of a better word. A little stringy, with a firm bite.The Thai sweet and sour delight is my favourite dish. Taste-wise, the sauce is very similar to the cze char favourite sweet and sour pork. The "meat" is deep fried soy-based pieces. Compared to normal sweet and sour pork, this "meat" is more compact but generally more crispy.Deep fried oyster mushroom is also a favourite. The oyster mushroom was covered in a light batter and deep fried till crispy on the outside. Of course, since it's still a mushroom inside, it remained soft and moist inside. The sauce provided was a passion fruit sauce, which was a little too sweet for me. I preferred to eat the mushrooms on its own. For those who like spicy food, they have a version that's fried with sambal.Olive fried rice was nice and fragrant. You get a choice of brown rice or white rice. Brown rice is a little nutty, adding to the flavour, but take a little more chewing than white rice. It has nice flavour, but this should really be taken by itself and not to accompany the rest of the dishes. Plain white rice is better for that.We were also recommended an enzyme drink which was fermented in-house over many months. It's supposed to have health benefits and beautifying effects. Quite sweet and fruity. We also liked the lemongrass drink and the Sour Power (preserved sour plum in lemon soda).For a meat-lover like me, usually I need a top-up of meat after vegetarian meals, but this meal was unexpectedly satisfying.However, do not expect cheap prices just because it's all veggies. They import a lot of their ingredients, and a lot of work goes into the preparation. We spent about $35 per person

This place is my last choice if I wanted to go veg. Granted, the food is really yummy (Nonya curry, olive fried rice, mushrooms) but it really is exorbitant, price-wise. Portions do not justify the (constantly increasing) prices. (Inflated prices both times I went)Service is great too. Courteous and quick. So only come here if you've got too much money to spend. Or if you have some vegetarian guests to impress

This place serves only vegetarian and its excellent in taste. Only thing is the wait during lunch hours could be long resulting in slow service. Food can be bit oily if someone id very health conscious. But its tasty! Must try once
5
A Singaporean local took me here, we ordered about 4-5 dishes, and everything was outstanding - the rendang in particular. Great vegetarian option if you have the budget for it.

I am a meat eater, but I rate this vegetarian restaurant very highly! Any carnivore who doubts vege food can taste good should visit this restaurant - it will change your mind with one meal. It is a little expensive - 3 mains and 4 drinks plus rice came in at just under $S100 - but it is worth every penny and well worth a visit to make up your own mind. For those that just can't let go of their meat, the mushroom dishes (called Rendang in the menu if I remember correctly) that are made to resemble meat are so convincing at this restaurant that my wife, a vegetarian of 14 years, was genuinely concerned that they had slipped some flesh into the dish, and spent a good few minutes dissecting it to make sure, to my great amusement. It was very clean during our visit and employs sufficiently courteous staff. High recommendation from me if your wallet can handle the premium price

Met a group of friends for our regular lunch date today and we were all rather disappointed. The food was average, portions were very small but prices were very high. We told ourselves that we will not visit this restaurant again. It was better when we visited it while it was in Geylang. What happened??

Brought my vegetarian relatives to this restaurant and they got Good reviews on the foods...Nice food presentation and tasty food that doesn't taste like vegetarian... For first timer, you might like this place.. A bad side of the restaurant is that they do not have round tables, not suitable for family dinner as We keep swapping dishes throughout the whole dinner which can be quite irritating... Heard they are working on that, so We shall see... ^

Visited yesterday for dinner. Used to be a favorite. The portions have shrunked compared to when I last visited about 1 year ago.My fav dish the monkey head mushroom with broccoli now comes in a smaller portion overall - broccoli pieces were smaller and so were the mushrooms which I thought spoilt the dish.Taste is still there ... Better deal can be head elsewhere

Tried out whole earth vegetarian because wanted something new and different from traditional vegetarian food. Was glad that to see the menu with lots of vegetarian friendly and non mock stuff. Personally, I am super afraid of eating vegetarian food that is actually just tons of starch behind the mock dishes. Tofu, vegetables all nicely done in either Thai or peranakan way. Tofu with oats was superb! Will come again with friends who are into vegetarian food. Abit on the pricey side thou, average of 30 bucks /pa

We went to this restaurant - Whole Earth - located at the end of a long stretch of building at Peck Seah Street just opposite Red Dot Museum off Maxwell Road. Car park is not a problem if you enter the Wilson car park before 7 pm on a week day.The restaurant serves Peranakan-Thai vegetarian food.We started with a 1 year old Enzyme drink - slight peppery, sweet and very fruity - served in a wine glass that makes this drink feel like an evening cocktail ( sans alcohol ).The food menu - there is a wide variety of food on the menu and we managed to pick 5 dishes with brown rice. All the dishes are pipping hot ( as in temperature hot ) and the two really outstanding dishes would be the monkey head mushroom with ginger AND the rendang which really can pass off as the real Peranakan beef rendang without any animal substitute.The service is great with friendly waitresses and on a Wednesday night, I must say business is very good with nearly 80% full seating.Price is not cheap ( about $50 per head with 5 dishes and drinks ) - but with a good stomach and a clear conscience , its worth the trip.Will go again !

This place was a great find, only vegetarian but the choice was huge. Try the broccoli with monkey head mushrooms and the scallops (not fish) with bean sprouts we were so full we couldn't manage but dessert but if the rest is anything to go by I bet it would've been deliciou

We were taken to this place by a local friend of ours. The location and the ambiance of the restaurant is quite magnificent. We were given a table if we agreed to complete or dinner by 2015 hrs. The food for about 20 tables were handled by 3 waitresses making the entire ordering a calling and waiting game in itself.We were given a menu and we noticed a few regular Thai food like Red and Green Thai curry were missing and we were promptly told that regulars can't be made and were told to order from the menu. We had to wait for at least 5 minutes before a waitress could attend to our request. Although, I'm not quite finicky about the time to serve (they are human, too) we were given a strict time to complete and hence had to be attended quicker than other people. The menu, although quite a lot, were mostly mock meat Thai items. The food was quite tasty although I'm doubtful if we would be back here for the "Thai vegetarian" food

Food r good .. try 1)tom yam soup ; sour and spicy drink till last drop!, 2)kang kong Balacan - ask for spicy .. it's real good with the balacan oil! and mock minced meat.
It's upscale = pricy.

Over priced food, it was typical hawker dishes glorified in the menu and pictures.
The staff was absolutely rude and horrible. Truly bad experience here. I would not suggest this place to anyone at all. Hope it closes down.
4
Vegetables, mushrooms cooked and presented in interesting ways but nothing 'mock' about the food
Ayam buak keluak is scrumptuous even without the chicken.
Olive brown rice always divine
Different menu from related restaurant naive and for whatever reason, almost better service.

There can be times while travelling in South East Asia you might feel distinctly handicapped being a Vegeterian! Not so when you dine at Whole Earth, Singapore. The whole menu is Vegeterian and the variety is considerable, with each dish more mouthwatering than the other.Served in a 'no nonsense' environment, open on Sundays,polite smiling staff....there is much going in favour of this eatery, for sure!

Dine at this restaurant with my family of four - hubby, kids 4 & 7 years old & myself. Overall, was quite an satisfactory experience, which we may return.FOOD: We ordered 5 dishes - Nonya curry (fragrant and tasty!), Ngoh Hiang (funny taste), Steam Tofu with bean paste (good with rice), Steam Cabbage with spinach gravy (refreshing but the greenish gravy looks scary) and Abalone with seasonal vegetables (vegetables a bit old). Hubby & i like most of the dishes as not only are they tasty, they didn't leave us with a bad after taste. We juz had a meal the previous day at Crystal Jade Toa Payoh and the MSG numb our tongue so much. Thus, this meal is good contrast and left us with a good impression!DRINKS: I ordered hot lemongrass and I like it. Hubby ordered yuzu and equally good too.PLACE: Location good with ample parking space. Was there on a Saturday evening so traffic was good. Restaurant decor nothing to shout about. SERVICE: Pretty standard. Do not expect much.PRICE: Expensive in view of the portion and the ingredients used.If you are looking for a place for a simple dinner and want to do a bit for the earth and price is not so much of a concern, then this is a good place

I brought my vegetarian friend here, and we both thought that while the menu was quite extensive, there was nothing that really stood out. We were sort of expecting more. DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get me wrong, the food was good. But many of the dishes are also served at other non-Vegetarian restaurants (in their vegetables and tofu section). Also, there are plenty of vegetarian restaurants that have popped up all over the place that have a unique specialty dish (and less expensive). The service was also just okay
5
The food here is amazing, and the service is just as good! My all time favourites are the Penang Rendang and the Nonya curry, but try and go with a big group so you can order lots of dishes. I went with my vegetarian sister, who says its the best veggie food on the planet. She had a nervous moment in the beginning and had to check that there was no meat inside, because the food had so much texture which is normally missing from veggie food. Two thumbs up
4
I had lunch today. I was extremely pleased with my order of olive brown rice with the bean curd and vegetables. I love petal beans.Vegetarian food never tasted so good and so healthy. Staff were pleasant but it would be nice if they can allow some minor changes in the dish like substituting some of the vegetables. I seriously recommend this restaurant for all vegans as there are no MSG or the so called mocks which can be quite a drag
5
Not sure whether the food or the staff was my favorite part of the meal. Service was cheerfully competent and the food sublime. I ordered Nyonya Curry and could not have been happier with my choice. Right on the edge of my spiciness limit, just the way I like it. No nonsense high quality Vegetarian food. Don't miss it

We dined here a Saturday evening. The restarant room is spacious and clean. When we were eating there where about 10 other people in the restarant so the atmosphere was calm but also chatty. The service was attentive and discret.We took Tom Yam soup which was really nice. The waitress had warned me that it was spicy. The lemongrass drink and coconut rice desert were delicious.Even if you aren't vegetarian like me Whole earth serves some healthy and tasty food. You shouldn't be put off because its a veggie place.The menu is priced fairly and the quantities are more than adequate.I will definitely return to Whole Earth restaurant.
5
Always try tio eat here as its brilliant . Very unusual flavours of the keula nut which we discovered is an acquired taste.!
Definitely recommend this restauarnt
5
Simply delicious and very authentic flavours. Unique and wonderful for all to enjoy!
5
We ate here twice during our week long stay in Singapore. The service is friendly and the decor okay but the food is divine! As a vegetarian I was in eating-heaven but even my omnivore husband loved it.
4
Food here is very good but way over priced. Plus no alcohol.
If you like the food try Whole Earth's sister restaurant 'Naive' in Eastcoast for more a reasonable cost.

I loved the place, Managed by a All Gal Staff. One of my Singaporean Friend took me there and also ordered for me. I loved the ambiance, Green and peaceful. Loved Olive rice, Pineapple Rice.Oatmeal Tofu is a must have.Everything is tasty and amazing. Though u might feel prices on a higher side but u will always find the place packed and people waiting. I suggest a prior reservation is a must to avoid waiting.Paradise for Vegetarians and Thai Lovers. Though sometimes staff is not as fast as u want them but its ok when u have some good company to talk and chat

We went as a family of 10 adults and 2 kids to celebrate my mum's 78th bday after reading great reviews. What a let down. We ordered their 9 course set meal as it would be easier for the staff. Starting from poor service, cafe ambience, food lacking taste and high prices- this contributed to an unsatisfactory get together. This place is not conducive for banquets as it has long tables and not round tables, this makes passing huge platters of food up and down difficult. My family will not be patronising this restaurant again. What a rip off
4
good selection of thai and local vegetarian dishes... and peranakan too.even my non-vegetarian friend loves it!!!try the adam pedas, olive rice and of course, monkey head mushroom dish.can be a bit noisy as the cement floor reflects sound...about SGD 70-80 for two persons - with 2 main dishes, side dish, olive rice and drinks
4
Service was great here and it's a nice, airy space, which makes me feel a bit bad that I couldn't finish any of the food we ordered apart from the rice. The sambal is just a bit too strong-tasting for me, and the faux-fish was a bit too much like real fish for me - that will be a recommendation for some, but I just couldn't stomach it tonight. The surroundings are a bit spartan and it's right at the end of the street, seemingly far away from everything, but it's not a bad place for a (fairly simple) dinner
5
This bright, cool, airy restaurant was a delight. Friendly, helpful staff helped us through the many varied Asian vegetarian dishes. Fresh, nicely spiced and delicious. Even the carnivores in our party were impressed and sated! Sharing dishes gave us all a chance to try several items. Not cheap as hawker centers, but excellent value. We intend to return and try their sister western-style place, Naive

Food was tasty and spicy at this restaurant. Lots of option, being a vegetarian and having so many options to select from was great. Loved their olive rice and Tom-Yum rice as well as Assam Pedas. Only down side is prices are high and portions are small
