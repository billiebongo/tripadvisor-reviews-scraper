Bestest Sup Kambing (mutton soup) ever in Singapore! Authentic and deliciously good! There are other stalls too but this place should be in one of your bucket list! Dine here alone, family or friends at around 2pm onwards. Nearest MRT station : KALLANG. ðŸ˜Š

Had a great roti breakfast here. Efficent, clean & cheap. Half of the Centre was closed assumingly because of the Chinese New Year.

One of older hawker centre that had undergone several interim upgrades as well as a major rebuilding. It is next to a wet market. Seating arrangements are more spacious, and layout is modern. Food is usual fares catering more towards heartlanders. Malay "tulan" is a favourite with Malay mutton soup. Some newer stores may not be up to mark compared to older stalls that have seen two generations running the business. Most stalls are not open for dinner.

If you are looking for an alternative place to start your hawker centre hunts here is a hidden treasure. This place is only populated by locals so if there are any Angmos out there you guys can take the MRT to Kallang station and start foraging here. This place is famous for among other things Curry rice, Char Kway Teow, Kambing soup, Ban Mee and Chicken rice. Most importantly its clean and hidden, my favourite all time favourite would be the freshly baked roti shops. Both make good sweet buns but different style. Don't say I boji
