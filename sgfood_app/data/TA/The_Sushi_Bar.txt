We went to the Taka outlet and it was our first time visit. Overall, the service was great and food were fresh.
5
10th time here (including the one in ngee ann city) and the barachirashi don is still great! the steak is a little small but probably because its $14 for a wagyu quality piece. would come back here again for my barachirashi don fix.
4
Always come here for a good and juicy sashimi cut! One portion not enough! The salmon is sweet and tasty. I love the aburi sushi. Chawamushi is another winner
4
Title says it all. Good quality food, good service. Expensive for what it is. Would come back if could lower the price.
5
The bit odd location in a boring mall in Singapore shopping area shouldn't fool you. The little restaurant serves absolutely amazing sushi. Definitely worth going if you like high quality sushi and fish - we had a softshell salmon maki, mixed sashimi, shrimp tempura and seared sirloin as well as some amazing pieces of tuna
4
Now housed in a proper restaurant space, this is a small cosy casual dining place at level 4, at the rear of the building called Far East Plaza. Their Salmon fish head soup with miso was tender and most delicious. Also, the Avocado and salmon aburi roll and beef was very good. Chirashi and sashimi was fresh. Chawanmushi good, moist and well balanced. Be sure to book, or you may have to queue for a long time

Had dinner with a friend with a reservation for 6:30pm on a Thursday evening. Crowd wasn't in at that time yet, only 2 groups of people in a spacious restaurant.Wait staff was cheerful and alert. We ordered a 3 flavoured sashimi plate with salmon, tuna and yellowfin. Salmon was creamy and tuna and yellowfin were pretty yummy, too.Also ordered a soft shell maki roll (forgot exact price.. below $20 above $10). Though not as humongous like other shops' maki rolls, these were made bite sized so pretty good with the right balance of ingredients and rice.Restaurant slowly filled out by 7:30pm. Overall a good experience

As much as it is the food, SERVICE MATTERS! No question about the quality of the food but when the service is in the gutter, even the piece of Toro in your mouth will taste like plastic.We were frequent patrons because my girl loves the food but each time we go there grudgingly. Tell me if its ridiculous..1.You cant get a seat unless all arrived( FFS my hub was parking the car at the basement and yet we couldn't be seated)2. We complained that the 3 piece salmon sashimi were significantly smaller during our last visit ( we order that every time so we know what we are talking about ). The waiter told the manager, who came back with one piece of salmon sashimi ( with a black face ) and defended that the overall ' weight' is the same. Implying that my eyeballing skill was bad. Basically they were RIGHT!With competition so stiff in the F&B industry, overall experience counts. No one can get away with bad service in the long run. If a new entrant or some existing establishments decide to step up, there will be No Reason for us to come back ever

The staff here are friendly and nice, they even ask if i wanted to have ice water since i am not ordering any. The food here are really expensive and it taste normal. I paid $67 for 2 and it wasn't filling. For people that want to have decent sushi with more affordable price, just dine at genki sushi which have much tastier sushi and really affordable.
4
came here upon a recommendation by a friend and it was a good one. The sushi slices are thick and fresh.Paired the don with jelly sake and what a great combination! Ordered a sirloin steak (100g) plus 2 desserts.We are company of 3 with 3 chirashi dons, 1 sirlon steal (100g) plus 2 tea and 1 jelly sake= $150Do come early if you don't want to queue bec the line can be long after 6.30 pm
4
Been there umpteen times. Mostly Known for their generous chunks of sashimi, scallop carpaccio and cheap beer. I would also recommend century egg tofu with tobikko.
Advise . Queue early. They don't do reservations
5
i keep coming back here for the chirashi don, thick fresh pieces of sashimi, a definitely go to place for your japanese fix.
5
I went early to avoid the lines. Not to crowded around 6. Had the chirashi and it was pretty good. And serving was quite large. Very fresh fish. Would come back.
5
I was brought here by a friend and it was so good. Reasonably priced quick service. The sushi is unreal. They also serve Japanese beer. There was a Queue outside when we arrived but moved quickly portions are really big and we couldn't finish what we ordered.Staff are friendly. Its a fast paced restaurant which adds to the appeal. I was back in the area the following week and just had to get some more, so i got some to takeaway, it was equally as nice. I will be back from more
5
7th time to this Japanese chain, 2nd time to this particular outlet at Far East. Has a shorter queue than the one in Takashimaya. The chirashi don is consistently good each time, love the generous and fresh portions of sashimi in it. Would keep coming! Heard they just set up a branch in Yangon, for those heading there, it's worth a try ;
4
Whenever am at Far East Plaza I never failed to notice the queue outside The Sushi Bar. Never had a chance till last saturday after 2pm I walked in since there was no queue and the restaurant was about 70% filled. The menu stated for some food items the preparation time may take up to 15mins. Thus I chose those that are pretty easy to prepare since I was feeling really hungry.Ordered my usual 2 portion of Salmon Belly sashimi, Tatami Iwashi & Avocado Tuna Roll, I enjoyed the dishes and the portion was not too small and the pricing was reasonable too. I love the salmon belly cos is not cut too thinly like some others I have tried. Seatings are not too comfy as some are stools with no back rest. I will definitely be back soon to try the other stuff in the menu
4
The Aburi Chirashi Don was delicious. There are 2 outlets and the prices differed. I am not sure if the outlet at Taka is smaller than the one in Far East Plaza. The only setback was that I don't enjoy all the raw fishes offered in the Aburi Chirashi Don
4
Went for lunch, not crowded at all since I came in around 11.30, so still pretty early. Sat in sushi bar (and somehow the girl place me on the dark corner part of the bar, eventho that time the place were nearly empty). I went straight to order their aburi salmon roll, and three kinds of sashimi. And boy, those things all came in huge portion! They have one of the most generous cut of sashimi, it was thick and huge and taste amazingly fresh. Their famous salmon aburi roll though.... well I mean, its also came in 8 (or 6 ? I forgot) big pieces, its a lot, its good, but nothing special, can't see why that one so popular. All in all, this place definetely worth a visit. Good location ( visited the one in Orchard), and quite reasonable price for Japanese food that has such taste and huge portion, order 3 thing (the other one was something with unagi but I forgot actually) + hot green tea cost me $58, quite something for having lunch alone, But its worth it Imo. Will def come back for their famous chirashi do
3
Overall service is acceptable even though the restaurant is pretty busy. However food presentation and quality, i will rank it as poor. First incident when we order Unagi roll and soft shell crab roll. These 2 types of sushi are placed (squashed) onto a plate meant for one type of sushi. 2nd incident - Stuffed chicken wing. We ordered 3 and 1 of them turned up to 1/2 of the size of the other. From the 2 incidents, i basically see no quality control from this restaurant. For value of money, i rank it extremely poo
4
Always love to get affordable and quality chirashi dons and makis here. They never fail to deliver fresh and delicious sashimi/sushi for pocket friendly places. The only downside is the queue that can form quite quickly during peak hours. Much prefer the Far East Plaza branch to the Ngee Ann City branch in terms of service quality. Perks of dining at the Far East Plaza branch also include weekday promotions for food items/beers.
1
Ngee Ann city outlet long queue lousy staff service. It's cheap because the quality is not there. Don't bother queuing if all your dining members are not there. It's pure waste of time and not worth the queue.
4
Salmon sashimi slices were thick , sweet and juicy.i had a whopping three servings! My first time trying single aburi sake- salmon seared with fire glaze... Was good too. Chawamushi was normal , but well done with smoothness of egg
4
Price wise, they are not under cheap eats but they do deliver on their value. I ordered 3 dishes with hot green tea and pay close to $80 for 2 pax. 1. Dragon roll - crunchy on the inside but this is my least fav as it's quite pricey. 2. Salmon aburi roll - Super yummy and soft salmon. Texture is nice and melts in the mouth3. Chirashi don - Very fresh selection and good deal of varieties in that decent sized bowl of don. Place was crowded during late dinner time at 9pm, but understandable since i fully enjoyed the jap fare i had with my friend. Is definitely my top 5 jap restaurants to go if i crave for fresh fish
5
I've been to the Sushi Bar numerous times but will only write a consolidated review to save myself from looking like a suspicious spammer.It is a fantastic place, and definitely one I always recommend when I hear of someone looking to go for sashimi/chirashi. Not only do you get very generous servings, but it is also very fresh and affordable for what you get. Contrary to some reviews that say that the chirashi is too expensive, I have yet to find any other restaurant in Singapore that offers the same quality & quantity of fresh fish for this price just yet. Both the kaisen chirashi(sliced fish) and aburi kaisen chirashi(torched sliced fish) are good, but I have not tried the bara chirashi(cube sashimi). I also recommend the hamachi kama(grilled yellowtail collar) which has always been really well done, but you must allow for 25 to 30 minutes for it to be done. They also do have good maki rolls, but I would not say they are a must-have due to contents/sauces and how food is really subjective. I would also recommend you go for the Ngee Ann(Takashimaya) outlet as it is bigger and has more seats. Do note your entire party needs to be present to get a seat, although if you are really early and they are empty, they may flex on this. Also, if you intend to arrive after 6.45pm, do make reservations. If before then, you should be able to get seats provided you are not in a large party

It was absolutely delicious. We stepped in having read the reviews already and were expecting good food.We ordered two normal Chirashi dons (which were, in hindsight too much and should've shared), a Salmon Aburi, Chawanmushi and green tea. The Chirashi Dons were delicious, fresh mix of fish and perfect amount of rice to go with. Salmon Aburi was melt in the mouth good, Salmon just melted in our mouths along with the crisp veg and sushi. Chawanmushi was silky smooth and delicious.Service was great, prompt, quick and friendly. Ambiance could be better but food is more important to me. Be prepared to pay for more premium bowls of fish/sashimi/sushi but in my opinion it'll be worth it.Went early evening on a weekday and there wasn't a queue
5
This place focuses on the most important thing.Not the decor, furnishings, uniforms etc... but the Food.Keeping the other items to minimum, the key focal areas would be great quality and portions that are not charged at ridiculous prices.Any other nicer restaurant would see the prices rice 50 to 100% more.Must try:Chirashi Bowl- splurge for the premium or seasonal. Enough for 2 persons.Top that off with one of their arburi rolls...Or any other sashimiHeavenly.This is a place you would see people who would spend a lot on omakase else where drop in for a quick lunch.I personally prefer this outlet over the other one at takashimay
4
I usually eat only the salmon sashimi. But for the first time, my brother-in-law ordered the above. It was a combination of Tuna, swordfish etc. Man, it was amazing. No fishy taste despite the thick slices. Good stuff. The portions were huge. The pricing is affordable for the portions contrary to other reviewers. My only gripe is the thick slices. Wished it could be thinner. But still, good stuff. Go for it.
4
This place is packed for a reason. We went on a Friday night and had to wait half an hour for a table. The restaurant is large so even though the queue is Long, it moves fairly quickly. Food wise, everything was excellent. We had a soft shell crab maki, chirashi don, a barbecued squid side dish, and an appetiser of deep fried tiny prawns. Service was VERY prompt and we were served our food quickly. My only gripe would be that it is a little pricey even if the standard of food was excellent. Our bill for the above items went up to $80+, not exorbitant by any means, but still rather expensive considering we didn't even order that much food. While I'd love to return, I don't think I will anytime soon because I can get the same quality of food at many other places at more affordable prices.
4
Food: Good solid Chirashi-don, no cutting corners when it comes to raw fish. Love their rolls and super delicious chawanmushi too.Service: They started really good, got very famous and so was very stuck-up. Then the raw fish virus scare came and the restaurant was half empty. It was during this time when they started to know that service is equally important. So if you go now, its kinda decent service. Just hope that they stay this way.Others: Really hate their low back chairs, often feel that I will fall backwards.. Heard they have a great selection of Sake, but I have not tried
4
Pretty impressed with this hole- in- the-wall small restaurant, i came back for its thicy sliced salmon sashimi. Service was prompt. They dished out the sashimi for ne almost immediately after my order was taken. Once i gulped down my first plate of sashimi, i order a second portion. This time i was a little disappointed- the slices were smaller and inconsistent... Yes there were three pieces and the slab of salmon differs but the least they could do was to give 1 extra but small slice... Aburi salmon roll was good. I might ask for less cream on top of the rolls. Overall a good place for sushi and sashim
5
Service staff is polite and the food is fabulous! The fish is really fresh and serving size is great. Definitely worth your money! No regrets every time we come here
4
We didn't upsize but the portion was already generous!
Sashimi tastes fresh too. As for the service, it's so so .. nothing special, usually Japanese restaurant is very friendly.
4
We went to Far East Plaza. Waitresses are attentive and friendly. Love the bluey concept of the eatery. The hubby ordered total 6 dishes!
Overall experience 👍👍👍👍😍😍😊😊
MUST TRY!!!! Great value for those who love Sashimi.
5
After reading reviews went there and choose the promo menu's. I absolutely loved it, food service everything. But it's not cheap! I would say it's worth it, but some could disagree.
4
Located on the Level 5 of Takashimaya, it was the only restaurant with a snaking line of people, waiting to dine in the restaurant! My friend and I ordered the same thing - the aburi chirashidon, as well as the fried salmon skin and aburi salmon roll to share between us. Had a few Asahi as well too. I really enjoyed the chirashi - the serving of fish was generous, and it filled me up nicely for dinner. The waitress served our food within 10-15 mins. The ambiance of the restaurant is quite casual - the distance between tables is quite tight, so it's not for those people who are looking for a quiet romantic dinner. The prices are reasonable, and I'd recommend this place for anyone who are looking for a good dinner in town to satisfy their craving for Japanese food. Yum
5
I have to say this is a hidden gem and hope it stays that way. The line/queue (always) is well worth the wait and based on Singapore prices the value for this quality os a product is great. I have eaten Sushi in many countries and The Sushi Bar can hold it's own with head held high.
5
I'm no expert on sushi, so I am not saying that this is authentic sushi or anything (I have tried some "claimed" to be authentic before, and was confirmed also by japanese friends but the taste simply didn't do great for me). But I absolutely confirm this is the best so far I've tried. (Or maybe I was lucky got introduced to their best dishes by my food expert friend. Simply there's nothing to not like about this restaurant, quick and prompt service, great food, nice waiters/waitresses. No wonder this is a popular spot
4
I always see long queues here at peak hours. This time round in between appointments, i came in for a late lunch at 330pm. There were empty tables available and less waiting. Ordered the populAr aburi salmon roll. It was good but i prefer less mayonnaise on top. Teenagers seem to love that but i had rather go less with mayonaisse. Each order of Salmon sashimi came with three thick slices! Yes , thick slices! Other places cut them thinly. I would return but not during the peak hours... Too much of an effort in queuing..
4
This is inside a mall, we were glad to see that there was a line out of the door, this signify a good place to eat. They only accept CASH here, so please come prepared. Everything was so good on the menu, my friend and I ended up with a sizable bill and no cash to pay for it. hahaha. All of the fish was fresh and delicious. Their seared wagyu beef was good too. Wished we had more people to order more food
4
My second visit at the Ngee Ann outlet for dinner. The place was relatively empty when I arrived around 645pm but by 730pm, a queue had formed. I had tried to make reservations but couldn't get through the line. The restaurant will only seat you if everyone is present. I had the aburi kaisen chirashi don for $27. The seafood was fresh and perfectly seared. My only grouse was that the rice could be seasoned better and a larger portion of rice provided because the amount of seafood overwhelmed the carbs. I guess that is a happy problem to have.
4
As usual, the place is crowded during dinner time. Restaurant looks newer compared to their other branch at Far East. Good portions for a quick dinner in town - sashimi always taste fresh.
4
Great place to eat sushi. Quality is really good, only down side is that the seats are cramped together. So don't expect too much privacy.
4
Had their famous scallop mentaiko and aburi rolls - ebi and salmon. As a person who doesn't eat raw scallops - IT WAS AMAZING. It didn't have the fishy taste that I thought it would have! The rolls might have been small but it was really worth it because it was made to perfection. Had a salmon aburi don with mentaiko as it was not enough for us, good as well. Pretty expensive overall ($80) but it is highly recommended for everyone to try. Will come back, but not often.
4
There are 2 outlets now, but still prefer going to the Far-East one, as it is more izakaya type, and somehow i feel the food is better in the Far East branch compare to the Ngee Ann city. The maki is awesome, and don't miss the happy-hour time for the sashimi to
4
Visited for a solo lunch. Good service, nice sashimi. I had the '5 types' menu option and it was plenty. I barely had space for my generously proportioned tuna and avocado roll. I recommend this place if you like lots of sushi and sashimi. I am sure I will be back
3
Staff not smiley or friendly, worst was the lady (may be senior manager or owner) was not smiling at all - has a sour face. Some of the sashimi did not taste so fresh. Maybe we just returned from Japan for holidays and in comparison, expensive and not so fresh. We paid $400++ for 5 of us
4
Heard friends rave about this little bar for some time. Hubby n I decided to try it out for our date night this month. They take reservations during the weekdays only. Environment is casual n informal. Good to arrive before 7.30 so that u get a table (if u walk in). Food is served pretty fast n their staff is friendly. Despite the crowd after 7.30, they r still able to attend to customers promptly. There is a variety of food on their menu n has a seasonal menu as well. Love their sake. Pretty good stuff! Sashimi slices r thick. Slightly too thick for my liking. N Ika was a little too tough. Otherwise, we love what we ordered. Value for money!
4
Came here for a meal with a few friends. It was recommended by one of my friends who had been here before. I have been to the branch at Far East Plaza. It was already almost filled with people when I got there just after the opening time on Christmas Eve for lunch. I ordered a Salmon Don while my friends ordered ones with more variety. I would say that the food upholds a high quality overall but it is not very worth it as it is quite pricey. I would say that it is somewhere to go once in a blue moon, but for that amount of money, there are other places which are more worth the money
5
Cons: Long queues at times, price is on the steeper sideBut the food here makes everything else worth it. Everything tastes so heavenly and fresh that I find myself craving to return again days again after my visit. Top-notch wagyu beef, Scallop Mentaiyaki and all the different types of sashimi/raw fish. Its signature Salmon Aburi Sushi is similar but a level below to Koh Grill's Shiok Maki at Wisma though
5
I'm a fan! Thickly-sliced sashimi on rice! If you are not budget conscious, I urge you to try the premium chirashi don that includes uni and botan shrimp. Shiny tasty rice, it was cooked and seasoned perfectly to accompany the thick-cut sashimi. Highly recommend to reserve or avoid the peak dining timing.
5
Its high end people, but the service and quality of food is worth it. Every dish, is unique on its own.
5
Great food
The real Japanse stuff
The Best sushi bar in town
My daughter is a sushi addict and she loved it
4
Simple set up. Can be crowded during meal time and required to share table. Food presentation is great. Food is fresh and tasty. Price mid slightly above average.
5
Prompt service - taking account itWas full house on a Saturday afternoon - the server was attentive to our needs. Drinks were refilled timely, orders Delivered correctly. We love the Salmon aburi roll, dragon roll, premium Chirashi ($49.90) , and fried IkA. Will return again if the queue is not too long
4
Reservation was easy through SMS with quick confirmation. Arrived at the restaurant at 5:30pm on Friday night when there were only a few tables and orders were quickly taken and served as it was not crowded yet. Had my favourite Chirashi Don and the sashimi slices were thickly cut and fresh, just the way I remembered it. Overall, a more upmarket feel to the Ngee Ann City outlet compared to their original branch at Far East Plaza and hence I think the prices are a little higher but worth it for the better ambiance
5
I love hole in the wall restaurants. And this is a real find.. We started with the Chawanmushi that was so smooth, tasty and value for money. Then came the Pitantoufu, if you like century egg with toufu, this is must have. The Scallop mentaiyaki is good if you have more than 4 persons sharing it. But the piece de resistance is their fresh Ponzu Oysters, I was transported back to a winters day Tsujiki market when I took the whole oyster and I ended up eating 4 in a trot.. IT WAS THAT GOOD. For the mains we had the softshelled crab maki and the cold green soba was refreshing.. Overall an exceptional gastromic experience that surpassed my expectations.. We have been back there many times since and brought many family and friends there already.. For Beer drinkers, they have happy hour draft Asahi beer from 5pm to 7pm.. Great way to end a busy day.
4
Recommended by friend to try their maki. Packed to the brim with young working crowd on a weekday. The servers was responsive and very helpful. Ordered all the maki available on the menu and we weren't disappoint! But the tables and seating arrangement were too tight for my liking. Currently only accept cash payment!
5
First time visit after several comment from my friend.Been the before due to long queue decide to came for other time.Visit there before the operation our and made a reservation for the dinner.Opens at 1730 hrs for dinner seating. Have their promotion item, 2 beer for $5. Salmon sashimi as well as maki promotion. Food served within 5 minutes.Their salmon aburi roll was perfect. Same goes with the other maki we ordered.Slight disappoint on the sirloin steak which I ordered medium rare with limited texture that I can enjoy.Overall will be back again for more.Great place to have sushi. Do check on their face book for promotion
4
The salmon sushi here is the best! The whole sushi just 'melted' into your mouth and the sushi tasted really delicious (with a very slight scalding at the top of the sushi - really brought out the flavors!). The seasonal grilled fish collar/head was very fresh and tasty! The chawanmushi here is not bad too. Tip: Come here for fish (salmon) sushi and fresh fish only as the other things are fairly pricey
4
First went to the Far East Plaza "hole-in-a-wall" shop with a friend last Saturday after reading so much good reviews about their Chirashi-don.A queue has already formed outside the shop at 6pm, luckily my friend came just in time when it was our turn as they only seat you when everyone has arrived.We ordered the 3 kinds of sashimi to share, she had cha soba and soft shell crab maki while I had the bara chirashi-don. Very happy with the thick slices of sashimi which were quite fresh.Then on Saturday I brought my husband to the new Ngee Ann City outlet and he tried the premium chirashi-don while I had the Kaisen Chirashi-don and we shared the grilled sirloin cubes .Went there again today with my husband and two friends and we tried the pitan tofu which was refreshing, the Kaisen chirashi-don, 2 serves of 5 kinds of sashimi, aburi salmon and wafu spaghetti
5
Superb food - especially the understated yet high quality wagyu don!
& truly passionate owner who wants the best for his customers!
Thanks for having us just before the last-order call!
4
Their sashimi serving is generous and tasted really fresh! Super value for money. Service wasn't that awesome. Probably due to short of manpower and overwhelming customers. Orders came all at once thus all can start at the same time! Will definitely head back again!
5
One of my favourite Japanese restaurants in Singapore... and it doesn't break the bank! The portions of Sashimi here are ridiculously generous, and there's really nothing much more to say. Well-seasoned sushi rice and their dishes are of consistent quality. If it's your first time there, try the normal Chirashi Don which has swordfish, yellowtail, scallop, salmon and tuna sashimi, along with slices of aburi salmon, tamago and freshly-grated wasabi. It is seriously impressive! Props to Chef Eugene Heng

We were trying to find somewhere close by our hotel to eat at for our last night in Singapore and didn't want to spend a fortune (we weren't in the mood for fine dining). After some digging we managed to find this place, I think we actually found it on Yelp originally. It's located inside of the Far East Plaza on Scotts Rd, and the address inside is actually #4-28 (this was in March/2015, I take this to be their newer location after cross-referencing with Yelp and looking at the older pics vs the newer ones). It was a little hard to find because I think it was actually on what I would take to be the 5th floor and kinda tucked toward the back. There's nothing else really around on that floor I could give you as a landmark, unfortunately. When we got there, there was a little bit of a line, but it wasn't too bad. I think only two groups were ahead of us and we didn't care if we sat at the bar, we preferred it. So I don't think we really waited longer than 15mins. Inside it's small and very busy, and I think we were the oldest patrons in the whole place (I'm 31 and my bf is 29). It seems to be a very young clientele and it had a sort of izakaya feel to it. The staff were all really friendly and in a good mood. We didn't try any of the huge bowls (they are seriously huge, but beautiful-looking) and mostly stuck to sashimi and maki rolls. Everything we had was delicious and I kinda felt like I was in Tokyo again. Definitely set the mood since we were heading to Tokyo the next morning. As others have mentioned, it is cash only, but it's not hard to find an ATM. I found the prices to be very reasonable and included some pics of the menu in my review because I was having trouble figuring out the price range of this restaurant before I went, so I hope that helps someone out. The pic of the restaurant is pretty much how big the restaurant is, plus the bar seating. So if you're a big group of like, 10 people, you might have a rough time.If you're in the mood for some sushi and you're in the area, this is a great choice. By the way - the pic I included of the line was the line after we left. I'm not sure if that's considered long for this restaurant or not, but it didn't look too bad (based on other times I've queued for restaurants in various parts of Asia)
5
The sushi bar has just moved to Ngee Ann City level 5. We discovered it one month ago and we are totally in love with it! We tried the ponzu oysters (the best we had, ever), the Aburi Kaisen Chirashi Don and Dragon Roll. A BLAST! We've been there a few times already and will definitely be back
4
We had the premium sashimi, oysters, 100g steak, salmon belly soup and one of the sushi rolls. All items were wonderful especially the steak which just melted in my mouth and the oysters which were super fresh. I don't think you can really fault them for their food. If there is one thing I have to say, it would be that the seats are very close together, you are practically elbowing the stranger next to you. but given its demand, you cant blame them for packing in as many seats as possible. other than that the service was not too bad given the crowd and the waiting time was very reasonable. Would try it again off-peak
2
I visited this restaurant with a friend, so that makes 2 of us, and had dinner. We decided to try out this recommendation from a cousin, who claimed the Owner was her friend and that the place was pocket friendly. My cousin also claimed that Sushi Bar serves authentic Japanese cuisine with 4 star quality.I will be questioning my cousin's future recommendations because:1. I would rate the general food quality to be 3 stars;2. Sashimi quality to be 3.5 stars;3. Ambience to be 1.5 stars;4. PRICED AT 5 STARS.We spent SGD75 per pax and didn't feel satisfied with our meal at all. We are better off staying with Sushi Tei which is of equivalent quality and price but definitely a more comfortable dining environment
4
Chirashi don is one of the best I have tasted and I would say it is comparable to those I have eaten in Japan. The sashimi servings were so generous that I had to take a double take to ensure it was the right order. Will want to try their sushi for the next visit. A pity it is closed on Sunday
5
It was good. So good that when my friend and I took our first bites, there was silence :) The thick slices of fresh salmon together with the "pop in your mouth" roe were the highlights of the chirashi. We went at around 2PM during a weekday, so the crowds weren't there. I'll recommend the humble chawanmushi and the salmon aburi roll too as sides to share! An extremely satisfying meal! We'll be back for more
3
You'd wonder what is the clientèle of this place. Located in one of the most 'utilitarian' malls in the Orchard Road area, the place itself has zero atmosphere, and is as much of a dump as the eateries one level below or the fast-food joints in the basement. The locale is always full, and there is often a queue. The food is quite good - sushi/sashimi, don, cooked fish, etc - one notch above Sushi Tei (or more elegant Japanese joints in better malls) for roughly the same price. Never mind that prices are much higher than at any eatery in this mall. You wouldn't make a special détour for The Sushi Bar, but this relic from the 80's is a keeper. Bring cash, they don't take credit cards
5
The sushi bar serves great authentic Japanese food! The salmon aburi sushi is super tasty and if you only have room for one dish, its this one! Will come back again! Take note of the long queues during peak periods though!

The food is pretty good but I'm not convinced it's worth the long queue. There are other good options for that quality and price point.

My office colleagues were lookinh for a venue for lunch, and they asked me for a place to recommend.I recommended on this restaurant, which is a quick train ride away and not some place that’s too close to the office. The birthday girl was agreeable and we headed here. I arrived first and there was a queue of about 4 people in front of me. My colleagues arrived just as I was about to get a table. The restaurant’s policy is that the whole group has to be present before they allow you to sit at the table. So ensure your whole group is present. So it’s just nice.Here are the highlights of our meal:- Scallop Mentaiyaki: $13.90. thinlly sliced scallops on a plate with mentaiko cream squeezed across them and flame broiled. Very decadent dish. Finished it to the last morsel.- Wafu Spaghetti: $10.90. Thin Spaghetti rolled up to look like a squid in a mentaiko cream sauce and topped with ebi roe. Its good. I couldn’t bear pulling the noodles apart to eat it. - Curry Rice: $13.90. Fried pork cutlet with Japanese curry sauce and Japanese rice. The curry sauce is sweet as what Japanese curry wil taste like. It’s alright. - Normal Chirashi Don: $24.90. The portion is big. The group of us shared this. In my view, its too much for 1 person to finish and you will probably feel ‘Jer Lak’ (tired of eating the same thing) midway through, if you are eating this all by yourself. It has a good variety of fresh sashimi and is good value. Try it!- Sake Belly Sashimi: $6.90. Salmon Belly Sashimi. Fatty and yummy. - Salmon Aburi Roll: $14.90. Salmon wrapped roll with avocado and topped with mentaiko cream then flame broiled. Taste good. Loved this. - California Roll: $8.90. Standard stuff, with lots of ebi roll on the outside.- Hotate Salmon Aburi: $18.90. My favorite dish. It’s a salmon sushi rice roll with scallop wrapped on the outside, topped with a dollop of mentaiko on each slice and flame-torched. Taste good. Must try!- Spider Hand Roll: $4.50. Each of us had a spider hand roll. Eat it quickly, else the seaweed will turn soft in a minute or so.It has avocado, half a deep fried soft shell crab, cucumber stick and mayonnaise. Not bad.The food here is good, would recommend to come with a group of friends, so you can order more dishes and try more dishes!Although the queue can be long, the food is worth the wait.Recommended

I have heard of this restaurant from various people over the past months and decided to try them when I was in the neighbourhood last week.We were out shopping and when we finally were looking for a place for lunch, it was 4.30pm. We went to the outlet at #04-28, but they were closed, as it was their break time, between lunch and dinner time.The lady working there suggested I visit their other outlet at #03-89 instead, which is open throughout, as the third floor outlet do not have the afternoon break time, and open throughout.So my ‘lunch’ partner and I went to the third floor outlet. It was located at the back corridor, away from the building atrium. There’s bar counter seating for 4 pax and several tables in a row, seating up to 10 pax. I spoke to the chef and he said the menu at this outlet is smaller than the one on the fourth floor, as they can only use induction cooker and the small gas burners. They have a limited menu, and we ordered the following items:- Salmon Sashimi: $2.90, This was a special priced item, as the restaurant is celebrating their 2nd anniversary! Incidentally, the day we dined was the last day of the promotion. We spotted quite a few tables ordering this dish several times.- Wafu Spaghetti: $10.90, The spaghetti was served in a shape of a squid, with the mentaiko cream sauce on the plate and topped with sakura ebi roe. It was good! Highly recommended, especially for those who love mentaiko.- Ebi Fry Salmon Aburi Roll: $16.90, A whole deep fried prawn rolled with avocado, cucumber and rice into a rice roll, then topped with salmon and mentaiko cream and flame broiled. We got two rolls for this order. It was good. - Okura Ponzu: $4.90, Sliced cooked lady’s finger in a ponzu sauce. I couldn’t get enough of this dish and ordering another would be too much. Recommended.- Yamaimo Teppan: $8.90, Chinese yam that has been grated and placed on a small hot plate that has been heated and served to our table. On the top, the grated yam is partially cooked, while the They are generous with their wasabi. We enjoyed our meal here and would definitely be back again. Try it

Read so much about the rave reviews on this hidden gem and just had to try it despite the negative reviews. I arrived at 7pm on a work day and was able to get a table immediately. I was ushered to the section at the back, where the kitchen was. Not exactly the ambience i had in mind though. Anyway, I opted for a table seat as i had a big tote and counter seat will mean having nowhere to place my tote. So, with table seat, i was able to put my bag on the chair next to me.Getting the wait staff's attention was not easy as they are too focused on their tasks to initiate eye contact with customers. It was good tt the food came quite fast. I ordered a salmon sashimi + chawanmushi + signature ebi sushi. The food was decent. However, halfway to finishing the sushi, i was asked to remove my bag fm the chair. There was another seat available nearby, so I'm not sure why the staff had to disrupt my dining experience. Although the other customer was eventually ushered to an adjacent table, I felt hurried to head for the check out. On this account, this restaurant scored poorly. Dining is not just the food, but the experience of enjoying the food. Unfortunately it looked like this was lost on the management of this sushi bar. I spent $30. Could have eaten in peace in the other nearby cafes

A place with ridiculous rules imposed on customers.1. If you are a party of 3, in a table of 4, they remove the 4th chair so that no other friends will be able to join in later. 2. One of our friend left after 5 mins, and another friend came later, although we are still in a group of 3, we were not allowed to order any additional food! Waiter said "you have broken the rules, you changed person sitting here originally, SO YOU CANNOT ORDER ANYMORE"So we continued to sit there for another 40 mins drinking green tea, not being able to order extra food. How ridiculous is that????Absolutely no common sense, I will not come back to this place ever ! There was zero customer service and even though the food was good; it left a bad taste in our mouth. Customers should stop queuing there to give them a lesson

Saw many reviews, finally visited with my family on a weekend nite. We arrived early before 6pm, there was already a queue. If not all your family or friends are there, you will not be seated.We ordered 2 chawamushi, 1 tako Wasabi raw (octopus in wasabi), 4 Teba Gyoza (fried stuffed chicken wings), 1 Bara Chriashi Don, 4 pcs Salmon Sush, 4 Unagi Sushi, 1 California Roll, 1 very excellent Ebi Fried Salmon Aburi, i serving of premium sashimi ($85), and 1 premium Moriwase Nigiri ($32.90). See pictures to have better idea of items ordered.The last 2 items are among the more pricey stuff but the freshness of ingredients. Standout item was the Ebi Fried Salmon Aburi, a must order. Cash payment or by NETS only.Must try if you are in Scotts Road vicinity

(MUST TRY)Cold soba -tasted nicer soba elsewhere but here is just..oh-k.Sirloin steak -it was served with a special spicy+sweet+mayonnaise-liked dip. extremely luscious

Service was terrible. Staffs were arrogant. Share holder's friends allowed to jump queue and wait on 4 seater table for friends during busy period just adds to bad frustration. Waitress pushy for us to complete ordering with bad attitude. Staffs were very inflexible and will not allow friends to join our table. They specifically have a sign that reads: "We reserve the rights to refuse any customers".

Hate to review this place as it's already very packed without much reviews written about the place. This place is very popular with young people as the prices are pretty affordable for the pockets. My hubby and I ♥ their salmon aburi roll which is a hot seller here and also d hotate mentaiyaki carpaccio. The place is in a humble location at Far East Plaza and d queue starts even 30mins before the shop is officially open! Reservations are often booked up to 1.5weeks in advance so my hubby and I just do the walk-in instead. The seating are tight and service can varies with the number of guests inside the shop. Good to come early for dinner or late lunch (if no reservations) to minimize the stress of gobbling down the food with so many eyes staring at your seat. A good place to have an enjoyable Japanese meal with friends & family(not big groups)
