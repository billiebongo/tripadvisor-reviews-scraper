You won't expect to find an artisan ice cream place here amongst all the old shops. I have been wanting to try it after passing it a few times. Now I can see how they have survived - good slow work, resulting in good food.

Nice. Friendly staff as well. I had the Milo-flavoured one and the Blue Cookie Monster! They have many flavours that remind you of home, like Horlicks, Milo, cookies and cream etc. Must try....!
