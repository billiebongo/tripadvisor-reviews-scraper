The restaurant has a nice environment, not too packed but yet away from the hustle and bustle of busy Orchard Road.
The high tea buffet selection was a tad limited though.

Wonderful place to catch up with friends. Food was good. Service is excellent. We called to reserve a table with good view. Music was not too loud.

My go-to place when I am looking for a place to chill with my friends to have a good conversation and drinks. Drinks are affordably priced and non-drinkers have mocktail and coffee options. Love it!

Quiet place during the day to kill a few hours with orchard road view. They have high tea buffet on weekend and public holiday at 28 SGD++

We hosted a group of friends as part of this venue Ladies night on Wednesday. The service was terrible - it took 50mins to get cheese board and in the end we had to cancel a number of orders because they didn't arrive before we left.We had to chase down the staff to get service for Drinks and food. We will not be bac

Spent Good Friday enjoying a Singapore High Tea at Lounge@Jen. Ambience of the Lounge is cozy, the colors used within the outlet made you feel just like home. The spread of the buffet was quite reasonable. Though it's not like a full buffet spread but the dishes presented are sufficient to fill your hungry soul! We were too full to try dessert!Out of all dishes, we gave two thumbs up for Mee Siam (dry version)! As for Laksa Fried Rice, I personally felt that the taste of laksa was mild. Siew Mai were tasty, we felt that the skin of the Soon Kueh was too thick.They currently have a local cocktail promotion, these 4 types of cocktails are created based on local flavors eg: Banana cocktail, Kaya cocktail, Milo cocktail and Ice Kachang! How interesting! I tried the Kaya cocktail, it has a refreshing taste. Not too bad.Guests can help themselves with beverages such as coffee, tea etc... Free-flow.An interesting find, they have a phone charging box with 12 individual boxes (i think it's 12 or maybe more, can't remember) placed around the hotel. So if your phone needs a quick charge while you are enjoying your meal, you may select a box plug in the cable and lock your phone in it. Yes, each small box has a lock/key. So your phone is safe.The team members were friendly and helpful. First impression counts, from the moment I was at the entrance till I left the outlet, everyone had a smile on their faces.No doubt, we will be back again

We had a girls' night out on Friday evening. Hotel Jen @ OrchardGateway provides the best value for the evening. Girls can choose free flow either wine or bubbles from 6- 8pm with only S$25++ per person. Ladies night normally on Wednesday but Hotel Jen extends to both Wednesday and Friday which is great! Great place for girls chitchat night!

Have been here for quite a few times - afternoon tea, night snack and drinks. The location is one of the reason why we visit frequently. Price was very reasonable l, the food were good and the place was cosy. Just that you should better make reservation in advance as for 1-2 times the whole place was booked for private event when we casually walked-in for afternoon tea

The ladies night promotion at Lounge @ Jen is really a very good deal, with great quality wines, and good service. Not our first time there, and we enjoyed it every time. Ambiance is great too! Perfect for nights out! Only improvement we can wish for is to have more selection of finger food and bar snacks for us as proper dinner, since ladies night start early

Took advantage of the 7 at 7 promo. Order drinks and snacks from the menu. All are great. Staff are friendly and attentive. Good ambiance to relax if there is no airing of soccer match at the bar. Think the fans also enjoyed themselves , lots of cheering going on. Good place to find affordable drinks. Super!!
