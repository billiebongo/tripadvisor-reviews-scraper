Came here for lunch with friends on a weekday. Had to arrive before 12pm to avoid the lunchtime crowd. The food at this outlet is good esp. the fried garlic rice. The price is also pretty reasonable given the quality of the food.

The food is really yum and there is a lot to choose from, either from the conveyer belt or from the menu. The prices are sometimes a bit high but the quality is worth the higher prices. I would recommend it for Sushi lovers.

Had a gathering with friends at this branch for dinner during a weekday evening. As it is in CBD (Raffles Place), the rush hours crowd is gone and the pubs come alive with people who work in the vicinity patronising them to wear off their tiring work day. There several pubs/bars right outside the branch, it create a nice ambience in the area with soothing musics and close to nil traffic. It is within walking distance to 3 MRT stations, Raffles Place (under 10 mins), Telok Ayer (the closest, approx 3-5 mins walk) and Chinatown (under 10 mins). Coming back to the restaurant, there is no crowd when we reached around 1830 hr (SG time). We were quickly shown to our table and settled down to order our food. The food quality is good except for the presentation of the dishes. The branch needs to improve on the presentation, given the customers have high standard and expectation of the brand. As it is the CNY season, we ordered the Yu Sheng for Lo-Hei. The staff prepared the stuff at our table reciting the auspicious phrases for each topping. The ingredients are very fresh and we love the tangy sauce added which balance the sweetness of the plum sauce. This branch actually closes early as we were told by staff of last order at around 2130 hr. Overall, good experience and will definitely consider this branch the next time I want to have Sushi Tei

Sushi Tei is among the most popular Japanese restaurants in Singapore. There are quite a number of branches and the quality is consistently good at the branches we have been to. Service is good although they can get quite busy during the peak timings. Our average bill is about $30 per person. Sashimi is very fresh, probably because the food flows quite fast due to the crowds

When I was working and going gym in town, it's one of my favorite dining place. But now I visit once in awhile when I happen to be in town for meeting and appointments. Quality of food consider pretty good compared to a few other brands. Price not the cheapest but still affordable especially you are member and it's your birthday month. The only complain I have with this brand is members need to pay for green tea when in the past it was free. They ahould give it to us to promote good health and chance to promote their green tea sales.

And my colleagues brought me at this place.....Plenty of choice and packed with people at lunch time.But in the end I focused on the food.Excellent if you like Japanese. Of course you can have better in Tokyo in front of a Tempura master but this place in Singapore if not that bad either.Very quick service but the staff could smile a bit more

16 of us walk in at Happy Hour and they quickly organized a long table to seat us all. Our host ordered a few appetizers to share. Those were a little slow- sashimi which you don't have to cook arrived after our main courses?We each ordered a main course and the staff cleverly took orders from both ends of long table.Food is as good as it always is. Water and green tea flowed freely, sashimi as fresh as it always is. We had a great enjoyable time

I thought weekend in the central busines district will be dead quiet but i was wrong ! Sushi teh had regular streams of customers coming in... It did not feel like a weekend in the busines district.. Service was prompt, food standards similar to other sushi tei outlets..

I would consider this as a quick japanese meal. Prices were reasonable, quality of fish was good and service staff members were fast in getting what i want. However this is not a romantic place if you are looking to wine and dine with your partner.

From Japanese point of view, it was disappointing then price is not so special. Atmosphere of Restaurant is good. I wish quality of Sushi gets improved

This is one of the place which i will drop by, either alone or with friends whenever im craving for japanese food..
Generally they serving good quality of japanese foods which i always enjoy to the most!

It is the worst Japanese restaurant I have been to in Singapore. Don't waste your time, nor money. You should go to Tomo Izakaya, Hinoki, or Shimbashi Soba if you would like something close to Japanese food.

When Im in a city where there is a Sushi Tei, I always go. Especially the beef udon is great. Its not cheap but its a good value sushi and good service.

Good:
-Good portions served.
-Quiet on weekends.
-Ample seating, thus a short waiting time to get a table.
Bad:
-Nearest carpark is quite far away.
-Long queue on weekdays, due to the business crowd.
-Staff maybe to busy during lunch hours, during weekdays.

We had lunch there on 8 April 2012. The area was very quiet on a Sunday and it was one of the only restaurants open. Sushi was good, Service was good. The atmosphere is that of a typical sushi place, rather quiet and peaceful.

it took us a while to find this place which although listed as 20 Cross Street, is in fact around the corner next to China Square Central!The three of us met for supper, the seating was good at a decent sized table separated from other diners by glass screening, keeps the noise out also!By our standards we ate sensibly, no gorging but left feeling satisfied. One could easily spend a year reading their menu and age visibly during the process, so best to be positive and just go for it without pausing over all the pretty pictures . In these situations I prefer for one of us to choose rather than spend all day debating.We did well and plus four beers we paid 140 Singapore Dollars

I'm pro sushi tei in terms of their food quality and variety, but service need to improve.So far, I tried quite a few branches - Jem, Near China square, Thomson Plaza, Paragon, Tampines and sometime ago Serangoon Garden too.So far, they didn't disappoint me on the food, except prices are going upwards.The one near China Square was my last visited branch. Food are yummy and fresh, but service was alittle layback even though there is hardly crowd on a public holiday afternoon. So maybe that's the reason I'm even more disappointed since no crowd yet service didn't meet my expectation.For those who wants to avoid crowd, you may pick this branch since it's located in business district and weekend is nearly

This location has a strong flow of customers during lunch time and sushi turn out allows a good, fresh quality of dishes. HOWEVER, management of outlet is poorer than poor. Unfriendly welcome, ordered dishes are almost being dropped on you. Cleanliness of the restaurant mostly by the counter is doubtful. Delivery of frozen goods are done in the dining hall while you're having lunch. and so on and so on. Keep the cook, change the boss

The sushi was great and the salmon and tuna sashimi salad was very tasty, and I would recommend it, but the service was a joke. The waitstaff sent one of our orders to the wrong table and my colleague had to wait forty minutes for his food, by which time the rest of us had all finished. Our sushi turned up in a random order and the bill took ages to arrive and then the waitress disappeared with my credit card for a very long time.The waitress seemed to speak better mandarin than English (which was very weak) and was clearly very hurried and busy. I think the management need to work on their systems and service delivery
