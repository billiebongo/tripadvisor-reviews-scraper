The meal was fairly palatable. Soba was disappointing though. The grilled fish and oyako don was pretty good.

The food served are nice, but portions are generally small.
Would recommend their cheesecake dessert :)

Thumb up to their Maccha Parfait which came with creamy Maccha ice cream and Maccha pudding, smooth green tea jelly, bracken starch dumpling dipped in Maccha powder.

Healthy fresh food served in a traditional Japanese home style setting. Good for family get together.

Good japanese food easily accessible in the shopping center at Orchard Gateway. Do try try the set menus instead of just the entrees for best value.

The food is standard Ootoya set menu - which I enjoy. In Singapore the price is a little steep compared to Japan; this particular restaurant had tasty food, good service but the layout and booths need a ‘boost’.

Ootoya has never failed to disappoint in their variety and favlours. Homely, familiar, and very accessible dishes make the restaurant an absolute go-to. I was delighted to know that Ootoya partnered with Chope as it made for a very pleasant experience all around, from securing the table to the final cheque.

We was there during Christmas Eve weekend. Everywhere long Except this restaurant, was thinking settle our dinner first then shopping along orchard. Order 2 set meal but only 1 meal serve and waiting for 20mins as not much ppl in restaurant. And the Katsu pork Don come with medium rare! What a Christmas surprise to us!! Ok, wait another 40mins for my meal and end up Kitchen forgot to prepare! Fine, decide to cancel and it totally spoilt our mood. Then I understand y there is not Q outside.Thanks for giving us a Merry Christmas Eve!!
