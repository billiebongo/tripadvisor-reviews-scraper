It is quite a cosy and comfortable place. Food and service was excellent. Team simply loved the evening with an exquisite settings. Good place for a small gathering be it a business or family.

This is the best food I have ever eaten. There is absolutely no doubt that this is the best Indian restaurant in East Coast. Started off with Dahi Samosas,Main course was naan kofta and rice. Great. Will definitely visit again

Food is really nice, especially their chicken butter and their naan.
The only problem for me is the ratio price/quantity.
Small portion but expensive.
It is a shame because the food is really worth it.

Very impressed!
Have eaten Indian food all over the world (& all over India!).
Found the food at Chat Masala was as good as anywhere.
The Fish Vadais were heavenly!
Will definitely return.

Honestly, the food is just ok only and overpriced. The service is friendly enough but I'd say that there are far better Indian restaurants in Singapore.

Had a good time eating mutton Bryani
And many other dishes such as aloo gobi,
Bindi curry and a lovely tandoori chicken n prawn.
Good ambiance and excellent service.
Unusual to find a Chinese waitress in an Indian restaurant.
Good value for money.

Wanted a naan dinner, so went to Chat Masala for a change. Restaurant's fittings and furnishings are very modern and western, not the typical Indian restaurant. However, the waft of spices still attacked our nostrils the moment we stepped in. Service was superb and made us felt very welcome. The naans came a little burnt but the butter chicken and the curry fish taste great. Best dish of the meal to me was the mutton - tender, spicy and savoury. The service staff kept topping up the water glasses which we appreciate much, given the spicy and fiery hot food. Damage for the meal came to $124, a reasonable price for 3 naans, 5 dishes and 4 drinks

I had been here with a few friends for dinner.Their Chat was indeed very good. We also ordered Paneer Kadhai which was by far one of the bests I had tasted in Singapore. Apart from Dal, breads were pretty much as expected. The service was good and I would like to rate them as under:Food - 3.5/5Service -5/5Ambience - 4/5Price - 3/5Overall - 4/

Been here many many times before. Family loves the food. For this trip, we had the fish vade, Chetinad curry, vegetable bryani, thora, butter chicken, and quite a few naan breads too. They even offered me an additional fish vade cos there were five of us. Very sweet of them. Definitely coming back again, and again..

We called Chat Masala about 15 minutes prior to arrival. They were fully booked on a Monday! We were told they could accomodate us in if we didnt mind alfresco.We didnt...being away from the airconditioning suited us fine at the end of a working day.The dining room was packed when we arrived, however the guest manager had prepared a table for 3 and was ready for us.We started with a chilled beer!The fish chops as starters were perfect with the beer. These are balls of fish meat crispy on the outside and delicious inside.Main course was Lamb Biriyani. This is different from the standard fare in other Biryani restaurants. The color was lighter, it was less oily and the juicy pieces of lamb were small and tender.We had Butter chicken, slightly sweet and rich. Mysore Mutton - spicy, rich and awakens your taste buds. We also had butter naan. These were perfectly baked with the right amount of butter for flavor and taste.The dessert menu called out but we have to go back for the sweet stuff.The service was unobtrusive and had the right amount of attention to detail.Loved it. The space will suit groups of 20 - 30 for dinner or cozy dining.Thank you. We will be back

Thought of trying some chat and hence, had come to this place but ironically there aren't many chat options. I found KP has much more variety. The food was average, the service was satisfactory.
5
We a where for my Grandfathers birthday and we were satisfied with the service and food the food is one of the best Indian food ever with mushroom Mati and butter chicken and more I would highly recommend this place for a dinner
4
Good quality low key Indian food with a slightly modern twist. the rice dessert was surprisingly refreshing and filling at the same time.
4
Regular haunt for simple 2 person meals and for family occasions. Food always fresh and portions are reasonable. Recommend to make table reservations.
5
This place is just round the corner from where we live and being spoilt for choice for good curry in Siglap, we'd not yet given this place a try - what a mistake! The food was promptly served and was delicious. The Dhal makhni was to die for and i have been craving it again since. The wine and beer choices are decent and prices are reasonable given the quality and good service level.This will now be our new 'go to'

Located in a little quiet corner along upper east coast road, its easy to overlook this place amidst the hustle and bustle of the usual city vibes. In fact, the exterior is nothing to shout about and the parking space is beyond limited. I counted perhaps available space in the front end at perhaps 5 vehicles and that includes the space of other shops in the same vicinity. Still, that is perhaps where its charm comes in. Being a hidden little gem for north indian food lovers.  The interiors are a simple affair with nice wall paintings which you can actually purchase if it speaks to you. Seating capacity is roughly around 30-40 pax on a busy day with some seats on the outside of the restaurant. The vibe is one of simplicity and homeliness and the staff were all very friendly and nice as well.Our meal started off with a simple serving for papadum which i believe is given free as a starter as it did not appear in the bill. It was warm, crunchy and and very aromatic with a dip which i am unfortunately unable to describe. The dip is greenish and came across citrusy which made this very appetizing. Dahi Aloo ChaatThis is yogurt with some fried crispy stuff and apple sauce i think? Its sweet tasting and helps to open your appetite to the rest of the meal that is coming. Butter ChickenButter chicken is my latest favorite item in the world. The spices, the chicken, the incredible aroma once done right is difficult to hate. This rendition has a wonderful creamy texture unlike other places which tend to be more chunky and its absolutely delicious with naan or chapati. Mixing it upThe star of the day is the mutton briyani which i've tried before on a take out from our kind hosts. When it was served, you can see only the rice and this, he explains, is because the briyani is made via a more traditional method of cooking the briyani and mutton in layers. The mutton curry is simmered beneath the rice and layer upon layer of rice, mutton, rice, mutton is placed before being cooked. This, he explains, is to allow the juices to permeate the different layers of rice so that its fragrant and it is without a doubt, extremely well done. A warning though, this is very spicy for the uninitiated and because its mutton, some people might not like the taste of mutton. For everyone else, this is fantastic.RaitaThis is probably boondi raita as it comes with fried droplets of batter. Its another version of dahi and is ordered because this writer is sweating buckets from the spiciness of the briyani. And this neutralizes and makes the entire dish that much easier to eat while adding another dimension of tastiness to the already splendid mutton briyani.Mango KulfiKulfi is something like traditional indian ice cream. Milk is stirred and condensed to a certain point and added with flavors before being frozen and that is it! For all its simplicity, this dish was very very strong in flavor and your enjoyment will differ. Still, with all the spicy stuff prior, this is a life saver and i thoroughly enjoyed it. This very filling and satisfying foray into North Indian food cost $82.83 for 4 people and is a little on the pricey side no doubt. However, hearing from our hosts on how authentic and nicely made this version is compared to elsewhere really opened my eye to how preparation methods can bring about the subtle yet powerful differences in the food we eat.Verdict: This is a place i'll be coming back often for sure. If for nothing else, just the briyani is enough for me to reminiscence and salivate for another meal there. Editors choic

No fantastic, nor will it be my last meal before facing the noose.But it does have an array of indian food to choose from.Palak Paneer is my fav. Dip hot bread into this and you get a decent starter that can also be a simple meal. Otherwise, dive into the fish head that is Kerala style. Not the soggy watery kind at chinese zichar. This one's got oomph. Overall, decent meal. But I won't come from Jurong for this meal in the East.Fans of footballer Sundramoothy... you know about Chat Masala already
5
Foodwise, it can be subjective to everyone's taste, but personally, I thought the food was SUPERB!I personally love their strawberry lassi, so it is a MUST try if you like yogurty-drinks. If you are not familiar with N.Indian cuisine, ask their lady boss. She is a real charming woman whose service standards is the truly the icing on the cake. If there is anything that makes a dining experience wonderful, it is GREAT service

Went with some friends for a meal and the serves are not large so we had to order two portions of some of the dishes for the four of us. The food was good enough but not really value for money, as it it fairly expensive. The service was pretty good and dessert was nice
4
I never had much chances to visit Indian restaurant much less to try North Indian dishes. But Chat Masala is a restaurant most people must have heard even for me who never visited until then. The place is relatively neat and modern but the North Indian cuisines were definitely great. The fish curry were cooked to be just nice tenderness and not hard; something I rarely tasted. Kudos to the chef
5
First visit when initially opened in 2003 while living in Singapore.
Returned last friday after leaving Singapore in 2014.
The food is still delicious and the service matchless.
Great to be back and look forward to the next time we visit Singapore!

Chat masala is at a short walk from home and thats the good part! The best part though is the food which definitely is exciting and mouth watering. We always experiment when we go to chat masala as the food definitely is top class.

We had dinner here last February with relatives and enjoyed a lovely Indian meal. Indeed portions are small but if you are very hungry you can order amother portion. Staff is cordial and friendly
4
Love the food here . But the portions are very small in comparison to the price we pay. Nevertheless would visit again for the food

I was a bit sceptical returning to this place given some of the scary reviews. Gladly, it turned out to be a pleasant evening. We decided to be seated outdoors as it was a cool evening. The two ladies serving our table were friendly and helpful. It as nice to see them smiling and engaging, often these days smaller places that is not the case. My friend was off non-veg the week, which was also reason to pick this place. They have many veg options - from starters to mains. While the mains were good, what stood out were the breads, their naans and rumali roti were really well prepared and served hot at the table.They close about 10pm, but didn't chase people away, or hurry with bringing the check, which was appreciated. Nice experience, will return again

I visited Chat Masala last month for dinner as it is close to East Coast. We ordered Dahi Chaat thinking that starters would be good as my friend had suggested however it turned out to be disaster as they had put in lot of green chillies. Seating and ambiance were good however they do not serve beer and only had hard liquor/wine. Indian food is below average specially when we have plenty of places near Little India. I would not recommend people to go for food, it is mainly for foreigners who do not appreciate Indian taste

We went to the east coast park beach and while returning we found this amazing Indian Restaurant to have dinner.Firstly,the restaurant itself is located at an excellent airy place.It looks like heaven.The starters were tasting really good.We ordered some naan along with Dhal Makhani.It was awesome to say the least.Will visit again.I found this in Google Maps and I couldn't have asked anything better

I am a hard-core chat fan, whether it's delhi-chat or mumbai-chat or any chat food-heaven in India. So when I saw the place, I was delighted that finally I can relish some delicious lip-smacking chat. We ordered pav-bhaji and aloo papri chat waiting to treat our taste buds. And yes we treated our taste buds but unfortunately with shock. The aloo papri chat was as bland as could ever be without a trace of green chutney. It was just aloo and papri flooded by thick curd. Pav bhaji was at least better than aloo papri chat but yet no where close to delcious. The pav were extremely small and the bhaji was dry and not at all tangy. I anyone has had a mumbai pav-bhaji ever, this moment would be nothing less than "Death of Pav-Bhaji". In the end we paid a heavy bill and wondered if the chef and owner had ever tasted real chat or was it simply not meant for spice-loving Indians

Always had great meals here and service has always been warm and friendly like visiting someone's home.Portions are generous and quality of food is consistently good. Parking is always a challenge though. Our favourite dishes are the Starter Sampler, Tandoori Platter, Butter Chicken, Mango Lassi and Gulab Jamon and Kulfi.
5
Chat Masala has been one of the most consistent restaurants. It has got a small but quite interesting menu. The ginger lassi is awesome to start with. For starters I have tried the dahi samosa and pakoras. The mushroom pepper fry and the egg plant strips are quite unique. Also Vegemolee is really good. And if you ever decide to have rasam outside home then this is the place (really spicy)Definite recommend
4
Quiet and relaxed restaurant, unobtrusive service. Food was above average taste and good quality ingredients. Pricing was to average Singapore standard for this type of restaurant.

Love the food. Try the salmon tikka and Mysore mutton. Out of this world. The fish cutlet is a great starter. For veggies the aloo gobi was very nice. For dessert the mango kulfi is yummy. Perfect way to end the meal.
5
We have been a regular of Chat Masala since 2010. From us being a married couple to 2 kids now. Food is awesome and service is really good. They will never turn away a customer and will always try to accommodate unless they really are fully booked. Favourite dishes - Prawn briyani, butter chicken and rogan josh. They also remember their regulars and we always get a complimentary appetiser. A restaurant that is we have to keep going again and again. Very friendly with our child and you can request some colouring paper for your child to do. Value for $$!! My mother in law came from Australia and she doesnt eat garlic and they actually cater and made dishes specially for her without garlic. Awesome service

Went as a threesome, ordered 3 starters but the staff said 2 would be enough (they were). Two mains and 2 veg dishes with nans and rice, and a beer each for S$108.All of the dishes were well presented, were hot from the kitchen, and tasted delicious and interesting - a little different to most.So, good food, reasonably priced, and good service.I never give the fifth star lightly, but this came close. My only observation was that the menu didn't describe the food adequately (which spices were used, what cut of meat etc) and it is limited. But that isn't a bad thing - I prefer a restaurant with a limited menu that can deliver the goods rather than one with an extensive menu that the kitchen cannot live up to.Almost, almost, almost 5 stars
5
We ate here a couple of times whilst on holiday. The food is excellent, lovely flavours and great choice of menu. Very reseaonably priced. Smallish restaurant so would recommend booking to ensure getting a table. Staff all very attentive making sure all is okay with everything and topping your glass up with water throughout the meal. I would thoroughly recommend this 'tasty' restaurant

Visited this place with family. First time my daughter liked starters and wanted more. Coriander cheese triangles along with eggplant strips blew all of us off. Very few restaurants where I have seen a fruity naan (unlike the usual Kashmiri naan). Lassi were just average. After a finger licking starter, made us to repeat the eggplant for main course as well. Mango lassi was just too good. Visitors should not miss eggplant strips, methi mushrooms are signature dishes. Wife picked up the recipe as well. Noticed a large juice with some mango and strawberry mix. Next time will attempt it. The dishes were were quite different from a normal Indian restaurant and unique. Kudos to the team running it

been to this place a few times. they can be really good and serve yummy food, briyani and egg plant masala is nicely done. but i find them very inconsistent lately, which is really sad. the staff there is very good with service , but i hope for better food quality. its hard to go there when you can't trust if today the food is going to be good

This is the second time the chef refuses to listen to the customer! This is the second time the fish curry/briyani has arrived all hard, leathery and glued together! The manager, herself has apologized for this before stating that the fish was not defrosted properly. When I mentioned this reason, I was told to place the order many hours before so they have time to cook it properly! Unbelievable! If the manager reads this, call me! I have emailed a complaint to the restaurant's email as well as Gourmet To Go delivery team. I am attaching a picture of the inedible fish Briyani. As a regular customer for the past 2 years, I will no longer be spending my money with this establishment

I cannot forget this spicy eggplant dish we ordered. It was very good, and very spicy. Overall the dishes we ordered were nice and we were satisfied.What I liked:1. Food - good selection of Indian food. I love Indian food.2. Place - sometimes it's nice to be in those small quaint places. This is one of those - it feels like a home restaurant and the owner was involved in the serving and the business and we like these types of places.3. Service - service was not so bad, sometimes you will see the owner is the one serving you too.4. Accessibility - if you don't drive / don't have a car this place is very accessible as it is just in front of the bus stop: Siglap Sth CC (Stop ID: 93099).What I didn't like so much:1. Price - I've already accepted that in Singapore its very difficult to find anything "cheap" and good so although I like the food here, it's not something we can eat everyday because it's a bit on the middle-upper level in priceNote:You need to make reservations as they don't have a big place and this restaurant is quite popular with the locals. Call this number: +65 6876057

We were regulars at this restaurant until I had to stop going there because of the chef's resistance to cook food with less oil. The food tastes really good, especially the biriyani and butter panner masala. however, we kept telling the chef that they should reduce the amount of oil in biriyani and other food and they just won't listen, so we stopped. the ambience is pretty nice, although a bit underwhelming. Ikea dining tables and a black, unfinished ceiling actually do blend in the decor. During holidays it's really crowded, so better make reservations
