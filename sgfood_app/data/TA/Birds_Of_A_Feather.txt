Good atmosphere, fusion food of western and Szechuan, very innovative. Pork trotter was especially good, a pity some dishes have small serving size. Warm service and good hangout place for after work gathering.
5
Leading by Chef Eugene, every dish was created by heart. Simple, delicious and pretty. A must try place. :)
5
nice and interactive wait person. entertaining! all dishes come with experience! my client said they loved it.
4
Waiter very friendly and polite
Service very good
Food choice not much, salty
Environment good for take photo
5
Service is excellent. Ambience is cosy and nice, suitable for friends to chill and relax. Wouls love to visit again.
5
Nice food and ambience. Very unique offerings they have there. Service is good too and would definitely revisit!
5
We really enjoyed the food and cocktails! Cocktails we’re very unique this is the place to go if you want to try great tasting artisans cocktails. The staffs are friendly and professional. Superb service!
4
Lovely ambience and fantastic atmosphere. But perhaps due to the rather busy crowd, some food are served much later than others. Overall a great experience!
5
Great food, great service. A little on the pricey side, but worth every pennies. They even asked us if the booking is intended for special occasion.Ambience is very relaxing, with jazz music and brightly litted for dinner, and they make the efford to switch it to dim lightings and soft club music after 9pm
5
We were giving the best seats in the restaurant and the staff were super attentive. There’s never a need to ask for water refill because they would just come and see if you have an empty glass every once in a while. The manager (?) was very kind and assisted promptly whenever we needed something. One of the best restaurants/bars in Singapore.
5
Got the spicy bolognese and I loved it. I'd say the food tastes more Chinese than Western, but it's really good Chinese. The plating was beautiful and the drinks were interesting. Would visit again!
4
Great place to chill and relax after work. Ambience is great. Food is unique. Waiters are attentive.
4
They are imaginative with their food fusing both Asian and Western Cuisine. Simply delicious. Drinks were reasonable priced and the ambience was great
4
fusion style here. mix sichuan with western.
the taste of the dishes are very nice.
but i dont like the weird christmas cake..
4
Such a pretty place with comfy seats. Unfortunately food was average at best. Would still return nevertheless
5
Good ambient design, lighting is romantic & relaxing. Foods is being served fast even there are crowds. Presentation on foods is good & taste great. Keep it up
4
Everything is amazing except for the MAPO tofu burger. I’ve tried MAPO tofu many times before and it’s amazing but this Mapo tofu burger is lack of spiciness and the ‘MA’ flavour. However, the idea of having Asian dish flavour of burger is great! Keep it up and discover more interesting dish!
4
Had drinks and dinner here before going to the airport. Good choice as the wine and food were outstanding. The ambience is awesome in a nice location with good street parking in Amoy street. The mini hotspot and Szechuan dishes are good though found the hot taste getting used to. They do have a good selection of small plates.
3
I've visited the place once before and had a great evening. This time the food was super lovely again, but the service unfortunately lacked attention throughout our whole visit. We had to ask for everything, sometimes even twice & it was a real hassle to pay in the end. Maybe we didn't have the most experienced staff that night, but they need to step up their game for a really great dining experience.
3
The restaurant was ranked highly in the TA ratings so we decided to check it out for ourselves.The setting is good, well placed spacious tables and good ambience in a surprisingly large restaurant, friendly and helpful welcome also.The Calamari wS plentiful and terrific, short ribs quite good, truffle pasta excellent. The spicy Bolognaise was okay and we liked Find the Chicken.Not convinced by some of the desserts or cocktails, we felt they were trying a little too hard and over complicated a few things although one has to admire their originality and the service was wonderful from charming staff
5
All the dishes we ordered are pretty interesting n the taste was good. The surrounding had a orange dim lighting hence cant take good pic of the dishes but still taste good.
4
Great chilled out place and nice restaurant. Very cozy feel for friends gathering.
Also a good place for dating couple with a nice atmosphere there.
4
Tried the angel hair pasta and it was superb! Place is nicely decorated, cosy, just right for gatherings or even business lunches. Excellent service as well. Will come back again!
2
The food was not good or fresh. It came out within 5 minutes of ordering. Pretty sure the chicken in the salad was microwaved, not roasted.
5
Very comfortable restaurant. I love the gyoza that comes in truffle sauce, find the chicken in the chilli, angel hair pasta, duck and fresh fruit tea. Everything is well balanced and I enjoyed the dinner!
4
Service was good although it was hard to cater my needs as I’m allergic to soy, nuts and sesame. You gotta dismiss after two hours seating during peak hour.
3
An incident waitress was holding menu cards leading guests to the table and her menu accidentally hit my frd’s head that’s like the first time I met such an incident and yet waitress is not apologetic to my frd just a casual sorry n walk off. Not a cheap dining place we expect some standard.
4
Food presentation was good but the mains can be small. I ordered salmon 2 ways and honestly it couldn’t have filled me if I was on a usual hungry day. Price of drinks was normal. Lights were brightened or dimmed from time to Time. Initially pleasant while eating but got a bit annoyed when it didn’t stay
4
Simply love the decor and what they have done with the rustic shoplot walls and bare walls and ceilings. Furniture blends nicely into the setting and provides privacy in most areas of the Restaurant. Unfortunately we were seated next to someone already in an adjacent table; strange considering we were one of the earliest to arrive for lunch. I am always curious how restaurants seat customers not considering early birds typically prefer more privacy and avoid crowds. The food menu is rather unique and blends between east and west. While we ordered soup and salad for lunch, we did notice a number of dishes were deep fried in the next table. Anyway, we continue our journey to try all the restaurants on Amoy street
5
Haven't dine-in here, just came for coffee in the afternoon.The coffee was great, the place is very nicely decorated and it feels relaxing (at least in the afternoon, lunch and evening time must be noisy though like everywhere).Above all, the staff of this place makes the difference: very attentive, smart and proactive.One of them even spent time to help me set my laptop to connect to their wifi network
4
Food was good, especially the pasta. Service staff was attentive and the restaurant provides a good vibes which we loved. Definitely coming back for more
4
I really enjoyed Diners' Choice 2017 Lunch Set Menu. Baby octopus was very tender and fresh. Spicy angel hair pasta was also tasty.
5
The food was great esp the bolognese! Chazuke was good too, the grilled salmon was crispy and soft! The best part is the dessert! Please order GWC!!
5
Great ambience for an evening chill out. Enjoyed the fusion dishes with a touch of sichuan flavour. Fav dish was the Fortune Skewer in Pepper Broth. Service was great too with the manager checking in on us throughout dinner.
5
Had dinner with some friends at this restaurant last night. Like the ambience and the food served. Is a pretty hip place and the foods were great too! Like the truffle dumplings and also the hairline noodle! Great place to hang out with friends!BRTon
5
Nice place, excellent food. Good service. Reserve a few days in advance to celebrate a friend birthday. Went on a tuesday. She was impressed and satisfied. Will definitely go back again. Suitable for friends or a date. Food is great. Had coffee after meal. Spend about 5 hours there
3
While I admit the restaurant was decorated beautifully, the food was just average, items you could get at many other restaurants. Service was barely attentive and drinks took a minimum of 15mins to get served. Pass on value
5
We had the burger and the salmon, plus the coffee dessert.Everything was wonderfully flavorful and balanced in taste. Interesting combinations with Asian and Western influences. Not the biggest portions though so a starter with the main dish is not too much. On the pricey side, but worth it.Great ambiance and good service. Would definitely recommend this place
5
I was first brought to Birds of a Feather by an old friend just for dessert but upon seeing the menu selection for mains, I was determined to go back and try their other dishes (especially since the dessert was good). The lighting of the restaurant at night is rather dark and the menu is printed on black paper so there were some struggle there but other than that, nothing to complain about! The 2 way salmon was really good but I would recommend ordering a side too if you have a big appetite
4
Many a times when you eat at a fine restaurant the portion sizes are too small to feel full. Not here the portion sizes are of decent size. The salmon cooked two ways was very interesting. Chazuke and the traditional Balognaise were the star dishes for me
5
Love the ambience every time i go back! The burger is great but the sweet potato is always a tad too burnt. I do not recommend the oriental bolognese. it's way too salty.
5
I pay for the ambience rather than the food. It gives you a good feel of dining in a garden setting. The best item is their signature burger.
3
This Asian fusion eatery with a Sichuan twist is "interesting", suited to yuppies in neigbouring office set. We of 4 ordered 4 small plates, 1 pasta, 3 desserts plus drinks, bill ended up US$200+. Unlikely to repeat!
5
Probably one of the beat bar along amoy street. Great customer service, awesome drinks and i had one hell of a night.
5
Nice atmosphere and relaxing place
Good wine during happy hour
Like the food also
My favorite spot is the corner table under glass ceiling, just beside some greenery
5
A very nice place to have dinner along amoy street. Feels like you're in a forest, yet at the same time elegant and sophisticated. Service was prompt and great, food was also delicious and innovative. We had the spicy chilli chicken and the tofu burger with mapo sauce. Tasty! We also had the desserts, which were pretty fascinating and creative - Monotone , which consisted of black sesame coulis and coral sponge, white sesame parfait and coconut mousse.We had a great time here, and will definitely come back again for more! :
4
this is an interesting place for lunch. pros : love the decor, menu is rather interesting. western with szechuan influence. the food quality is good, especially the salad - really fresh kale and other ingredients. service we had was above average. the restaurant holds up to 80 pax and there is a corner which can be closed off for private events. the girl who served the dessert could not explain the items of the dish and had to ask her colleague to do that. perhaps all staff should know what they are bringing out to the table. other than this slight con, the meal went well
1
We booked the place for a team event of 8pax and within 1 hour were told to clear our table as there was another reservation. There was no such mention of time when we booked. The staff serving was also not polite. I had recommended this place and now feel embarrassed. Definetly not going bac
5
I only popped in for a drink with my wife, but feel like I'd go back for dinner and drinks again. Waiter offered up a creative cocktail ... we really enjoyed our time there. The place is warm and inviting ... definitely encourage you to give them a shot
5
Walked into a beautiful oasis (skylight amazing) seated under a canopy of lushness and light. Maitre' and wait staff wee just there right amount of service and knowledge. The food oh my super delish. We had the Chazuke with the perfectly seared Barramundi, Calamari starter was scrumptious and my friend's Chicken Salad was just right. Can't wait to visit here for cocktails and chat.
5
A uniquely different place for a family dinner, decor was very chic, warm lights and interesting installations. Food was equally good, we slurped up most of the dishes. Would come back and try their lunch menu another time.
5
Amazing food in a very cool place, very sophisticated, delicious food for a very reasonable price, highly recommended.
5
Went there for business lunch. The atmosphere is very cosy. It’s fusion, so not really spicy. Menus are interesting. I had the tofu burger and the side dish is fried sweet potato, which is surprisingly tasty.
5
Well handcrafted cocktails from Ivan. Excellent service, good ambience! Highly recommended!!! Will definitely come back!!
4
Nice experience. Good nice place to dine, food is delicious and we enjoyed very much. We will come again...
5
The food was awesome and I really love the ambient even though I went there for lunch. Service was very good too
5
This place has a fantastic ambience, really cool atmosphere. We both had the Tofu burger and it was sensational, would highly recommend. Reasonably priced and a good menu to choose from.
5
Celebrated a friend's birthday over dinner and the manager/ assistant manager was extremely helpful in coordinating the celebration. He gave helpful recommendations of the desserts and also in suggesting which seat should the birthday girl sat so that she would not see the "surprise" coming. Very attentive to our needs throughout our time there, we had a really pleasant evening! Will definitely be back
4
Went to Birds of a Feather for lunch with some friends, the setting was really nice. The food was delicious too but the menu feels a bit limited specially on the meat side. Servings tend to be on the smaller size so if you're sharing food with friends, you'll need to order a bit more
5
Plush sofas, dim lighting, hearty dishes and warm smiles. What more could you ask for after a long day at work than to just plop down and relax?Walking along Amoy street, Birds of a feather will certainly catch your eye with its electic decor and chill music. Just less than one year old, this gem of a place has already garnered attention from city slickers as one of the best bar/restaurant in town. Don't be surprised to find them fully booked if you didn't make a reservation!Although the food is da bomb, personally I will never miss a drink crafted specially by the most talented bartenders, Ivan, Chen Gang and Vincent(The very charming manager BTW!).If you wish to impress your date, shift to a sit at the bar after your meal and order up!I love just how when you look around the restaurant, all the guests are smiling and enjoying. Even though I hope this place could always be a kept secret for my girls night out, I'm sure you, reading this has had a great time, or will be having a great time at Birds of a Feather. Cheers!
4
Good balance of taste achieved infusing Szechuan Flavours into traditional western standards (good selections of interesting burgers). Portions are big so go easy on the sat hong plates.
5
World class cocktails made by (Mr Ivan) and superb service by (Mr Jep) + Great ambience of the bar, can surely make you visit the place over and over again.
5 thumbs up to all the staff of Birds of a Feather! Keep it up!
5
It was my first time visited this cafe at Amoy street! Have been working near Amoy for almost 3.5 years but have never came across this cafe. The atmosphere is superb and the food is very good as well bonus is that their service is awesome too!! Love every bits of this cafe and will definitely pay another visit again!!
4
Very interested to try this. The people I invited are not interested in spicy food but i thought the reviews sounded interesting enough. We had the wagyu which was delicious lovely vegetables and flavour. The service looked a little lost and was not really quick. I thought the drinks were a little expensive compared to the food with a ginger beer at 8 SGD.
3
We were all really looking forward to our experience at this restaurant but ended up being disappointed. The restaurant is beautifully designed like an oasis. Some of the menu items are uniquely presented, but taste-wise, they were okay, but none really wowed us.Service-wise, we dine out regularly and were surprised to receive such poor service at a restaurant of this calibre. After being seated, we were not offered water until we asked for it, after 15 minutes. The server then put the two glasses in random parts of the table and left. Our friends arrived later and they too had to ask for water, twice, before theirs came. The server who took our order was "too cool", aloof and never smiled. We had to keep asking for our plates to be changed. Before our friends arrived, I asked another server about a salad which I had read about in several food blogs. The server assured me that he's been there since the opening and they most certainly do not have that dish. After I ulled the photo from one of the blogs to show him, he still tried to deny it. Is it so hard to check with another colleague or admit that he had overlooked it? Small issue but everything contributed to our overall disappointment with Birds of a Feather and its staff's poor service attitude
5
They had the best dumplings in town! Love the interior and ambiance, felt like in a forest with super fancy clouds lamps!Also tried the GWC (coffee dessert) and it was amazing, not too sweet just the way i love it, great taste of coffee mix with great brownies and superb food arrangements! Definitely will come back
2
I've been to BOAF on a few occasions and always ordered their Truffle spaghetti, which I thoroughly enjoy because of the thick cutting of the truffles in the spaghetti, which I thought was generous. I was a little disappointed at the last outing because they seemed to have reduced the size of the truffle cutting, reducing the experience at the restaurant
4
Restaurant with a great vibe both for lunch and after-works drinks. The menu is eclectic and perhaps tries a little too hard on the Asian fusion front. But generally serviceable in terms of delivery of both mains and desserts. However, allergans are not always clearly labelled - for example, peanut use was mentioned in the desserts menu but absent from the food menu. One of my guests almost walked away with a painful souvenir as a result - good thing she noticed the liberal sprinkling of crushed peanut on the udon before sinking her teeth into it.
4
We had a bachelorette's dinner over at Birds of A feather. Vincent was really warm and friendly & accommodated to our requests for the bribe to be! There's something special about their food which is most dishes have the spice powder sprinkle over which gives a different taste as compared to the usual serving style. :
4
A mod twist with Szechuan flavours! The food has never fail to amaze us each time... try everything on the menu! A lot of thought went into the menu; great flavors and pretty cool concepts. Been following the restaurant since Feb'17 and will continue to check it out. The aesthetics are plus as well.. great vibes (spotify included), insta-worthy.. love every bit of the furniture and deco choices
5
Great food and impeccable service at a very reasonable price. Classy interior design. Restaurant staff is extremely helpful (special shout out to Vincent for your great help) and I will definitely go back again.
4
Service is great. Restaurant contacted me to confirm that the table assigned to my group is suitable. Food is good. I will go back
5
I was pretty disappointed that i didn't got the opportunity to try the dinner menu, as it was Saturday, and they only had the brunch menu on. Overall, a very pleasant dining experience. The girls enjoyed it!
5
Love the food here, very nice mix style of chinese and western. It is delicious and entertaining experience.
5
I have nothing to say but very good food and very food service. The service level is like par to fine dining. The food combination of western and eastern is perfect. However the pricing is 20-30% above my expectation. Quite costly in my opinion. Overall can come once but if pricing is adjusted can definitely visit more often
4
Visited on a Tuesday at lunch time. The waitress recommended that we try the crispy chicken appetiser since it was our first time and we didn’t object. Turns out it was the best dish, and the other ones weren’t all that bad! We also ordered the potatoes, a spicy oriental bolognaise and the chicken avocado. They serve some really great coffee too. I really enjoyed the affogato.
5
Went as a group of 5, and the ambience was just right - intimate and well spaced out (not like many places where i feel claustrophobic with tables all up next to each other). The staff were so attentive and polite, explaining everything and being genuinely friendly. The presentation made me feel that the food was almost too pretty to eat, we made sure to try many dishes (as they all sounded good) and surprisingly every person at our party of 5 had a different favourite dish - there was not one standout dish, because everything was awesome. I'd recommend the Gyoza (starter), Chazuke (served with sea bass), Angel Hair Pasta and Duck (mains) and Monotone (dessert). Everything was fab! Would go back in a heartbeat
3
A large group of us in Singapore dine out often - and we arrange to catchup for food experiences often. 8 of us attended BOAF around 2 weeks ago - and had a large table.We found the experience strange, cocktails were good - but small, crafted into small vessels - to my experience not at all on par with other venues in Singapore.We ordered several bottles of champagne - and spend considerable money on food sharing dishes for the group.The Sichuan flavours were fine, the sizes of the dishes were not. Its expensive. Being expats from Shanghai now living in Singapore - we ordered a few classics - Chicken in the Chillies - it should be find the chicken - basically a plate of chillies with not many chicken pieces at all. Very disappointing. The other dishes were strange - crispy pork trotter in a bag - very fatty. The oriental bolognaise was ok but the rest of the menu was just ok. Whilst it was good - not average - it wasn't anything amazing and doesn't warrant the price tag..Even worse though was the music, I love 80's and 90's music but this was not eclectic, groovy or even enjoyable - it was just plain weird - and really horrible to experience that whilst going thru the above experience food wise.When the bill came - we had to wait 25 minutes for it to be processed. An unfortunate and fitting end to an night we had thought would have turned out differently..Sorry BOAF - no flocking from us again.. sadly
5
Just had to return twice in a week! Could not forget the crowd favourites... the angelhair pasta that had an extremely springy texture, the flavourful duck and the tenderloin beef that was done to perfection! Really enjoyed the coffee and smoothie shakes too. Ambience was nicely done up and special! Would definitely recommend it and go back again =
5
Walked around after dinner in the area and stumbled on this bar. Was craving for drinks and something sweet so this hit the spot! My friend and I had the 'Sweet Spot' cocktail and 'Clover Club' cocktail. I thought the mixology was good! Loved it down to my caramelised orange that I ate it too. I had a salted caramel crave recently so the salted caramel cheesecakewas ordered. Was blown by this! The cheese cake was just the right texture and the salted caramel on the top complement it, yet both together were not overpowering in taste. The strawberries on the side were sweet too! This yummy experience makes me wanna try the other items on the menu next time! Keep it up! 
3
Oriental noodles as good, especially with the egg and minced meat. Truffle gyoza was decent too. Drinks abit pricey
5
Super nice environment, very cosy with nice musics. The cafe is decorated with lotsa nice plants which make it more lively. Service of the staff is . What makes this cafe better is their super good food which are sichuan inspired western food, very special and taste so yumz! Oh ya, plating too! Everything here is just so photogenic, you can surely take lotsa of nice picha here! Feels
4
We ordered 4 main courses which all tasted interesting and yummy. This is my second time to the restaurant for dinner. First time was for lunch. Restaurant was crowded at dinner which I am not surprised given that it was a bar restaurant. We ordered 4 main course and food was good as usual. We then ordered 2 dessert dish but we weren't impressed by the pear dish. The caramel cake was ok. Go for the mains definitely.
5
An eclectic mix of classy, chic and yet casual - Birds of a Feather has filled up a big vacuum in the CBD area. For people who work there - we always had limited options for a lunch place which was good but not too formal. They have nailed it. I have literally seen my clients/friends smile the moment they enter the space. They are pleasantly surprised by the decor, mood, music and the overall unconventional setting (at least by CBD standards). Food and drinks are excellent overall. My fav has to be - Find the Chicken in the Chillis. My healthy friends seem to love the avocado chicken. The manager - Vincent is an absolute legend. Excellent taste in music and suits. Ask for his suit guy's number if you are interested. The space ups the charm level by a notch in the evenings. A must go for date nights. I wish them all the best!
5
Perfect ambience and attentive staffs! Some sort of modern Szechwan cuisine, Totally unique taste and thumbs up for the everything! Definitely will return back soon!
5
Had dinner at this venue, interesting concept and great service. Great presentation of cocktails and gin tonic! Will be back for more! Is cosy and food is amazing
5
We absolutely loved the dining experience here. From the moment we stepped in, we were pleased with the ambience it exuded. The service had a few misses which was understandable as it was a busy Friday night. But three thumbs up to see how passionate the staff were towards their job and serving us customers, especially Vincent! As for the food, we were pleasantly surprised by what was served to us, considering it's our first time there and we had no expectations. Each dish that came our way was simply scrumptious and we enjoyed all the starters, mains and even the abstract monotone dessert ordered! Overall, we had a thoroughly wonderful dining experience and would recommend it to our friends! :)
5
The fortune skewers is the best thing for a hangover! Spice level is just nice while still making you feel all warm and cozy :) The find the chicken in the chillis and Spicy Oriental Bolognese have also been classics here which you cant go wrong with, and service is great! Staff here are friendly, attentive and the drinks are to die for! At nights they slowly turn down the lights and its almost a club-like feel, great for turning up the party! Love this place so much and will highly recommend it! On the plus side they really cater to families with kids too
5
I loved my time at birds of a feather. I met and friend there and the ambiance is just perfect. The music played is a delightful frank sinatra - esque mix. Perfect for a date night out! The service is also super friendly, as everyone treats you very well. I HIGHLY recommend
3
Just plain weird service, all good until after the kitchen closed at 21.30, but then felt we were over staying our welcome. They decided to play a medley of godawful 70 and 80's dance tunes such as YMCA which I believe was a way of flushing people out. Either way, Just. Plain. Weird.
5
The bar delivers refreshing ambience that any one would love to have a second time around .Overwhelming service added to the quality.Love this place ..Highly recommended..
3
Leaving Birds of a Feather as a party of 8, we flocked together and agreed, we weren't cuckoo about the place. The food is actually a 4, with a twist on some Szechuan classics.We were a big group and tried most of the menu. Stands outs include: Gong Bao Ji Ding, pig trotter, pig ear, gyoza and the oddly named - weird tasting chicken - are all good starters.For mains, Sea bream and rice, duck - done a couple of ways, and short rib were fantastic.The venue itself is nicely designed, with low lighting, but sitting in arm chairs at low tables looks cool, but are uncomfortable and annoying to eat at.The staff were friendly and fun, still learning their menu, but totally engaged and did a great job. The music on Friday was laughably bad. Amidst the Spice Girls and Backstreet Boys there was little to keep us staying longer and hanging out at the bar. This is a bit of a shame, because like the food, cocktails are great.So why a 3 and not a 4? The prices are way too expensive for this tier of premium casual restaurant, and for less, you can find a lot more in Singapore
4
The octopus is a must try. Ordered fried sweet potato, calamari, chicken in chilies, pig troters the taste for them are quite similar. The oriental bolognaise is fantastic.Tried their dessert monocle, for $15 is not worthed
3
We heard good things about Birds of a feather and decided to give it a try. The ambience of the restaurant was great. We were ordered baby octopus, pig ears, chicken wings & calamaris.... after 30mins, our food didn't arrive while other tables who ordered later than us got their food (there were only two tables occupied when we arrived). We checked and found out that the waiter whom took our order forgot to press the send button when he entered our order. They apologized for the mistake and gave us two additional dishes (service recovery). When they were serving us the dishes we ordered, we ordered a burger. The same waiting game happened again.... we finished all the dishes on our table but the burger didn't arrive. We checked and we were being told we need to wait another 10mins as they didn't put in our order as waiting for us to finish our existing dishes (which we had finished 20mins before checking on the burger). We left without waiting for the burger. Food might be good but the waiting game took the pleasure away. Will think twice before I go visit again.
5
If you are looking for food with Sichuan Flavors influence, this is the place you should be at. My friends and I truly enjoyed every of the sichuan flavored dishes that we ordered, and were wowed by those recommended by the manager. In addition, the cocktails were well concocted and had great balance! We left with a very satisfied tummy and a happy soul, and we will definitely be back again!
5
I work around the CBD area and I love coming here to work when I need a break from being on my office desk, both on the weekdays and the weekends. I usually also pull my team mates if we want to take our meetings out over coffee. You pay pretty much the same amount you would pay for coffee around the area, but you get a way better atmosphere. The food is great too. The he Oriental Angel Hair Bolognese is an easy choice. I would say, around the CBD, this is the prettiest I've seen so far. I get very good service as well, every single time
4
Keep coming back , and always a great experience . This time with 20 people and team took very good care and were very flexible . Food is really a great experience and plenty to chose from and all with great details and flavour. Design and atmosphere is really great .
5
What a lovely bar! The sophisticated set up is matched with attentive service and amazing cocktails. The bar manager Vincent is a great host, he was very warm and made myself and friend felt very welcoming. Will visit again and I highly recommend it to anyone else.
5
As a Sichuanese in Singapore for more than 8 years, I find myself fall into love with this restaurant ever since the first time dining here. I love a lot their Sichuan food presented in western style. I love their ambience and music and trust me it’s not just suitable for dinner but also for afternoon coffee chat and night drinks. For the cocktail, I super recommend ‘Me before You’. It’s off the menu and I guess you have to order it from its manager. It definitely is their signature cocktail and a true representative of their mixed culture of the West and the East
5
we were a team 9 in celebration of a dear colleague's farewell and the team from birds of a feather couldn't have been any more hospitable. we had just about the BEST bloody mary we've came across in SG, and the food was phenomenal - defo will be back again. thank you for the memorable night and i'm sure our dear colleague will bring back a piece of you when she returns to france. :) cheers.
5
Yo these guys are the best dudes ever! I love these guys! Best people ever! Everyone should go here!!
4
Really great food , a very nice mix and combination of International and Chinese , love the design , very unique , good team working there - will be back
5
Didn't like one of the surprise cocktail made for me , nevertheless , got it Tweaked professionally by the bartender. Small gestures like this makes this place memorable for me. Thank you for your great service! Will visit again when I'm back to Singapore !
3
The service is ok. I would say it's a mid price place, not for the budget conscious.We ordered wings that were actually 4 or 5 small mid joints cut into half so they were tiny. The Calamari was delicious, Gyoza overdone, chewy, almost inedible. Ordered martini dry specifically and told the server from the aperitif section priced at $14 each, only to reach home and find out I was charged a cocktail at $25 each!Staff Jude is very pleasant and understanding, agreed to settle refund. $22 refunded in cash but alas they/i forgot the service charge refund Overpriced. Beautiful decor. My first time and never again
4
Interesting Sichuan-Western fusion. Monotone was a dessert of black sesame and white sesame. Nice presentation and tasted good. Also tried Kawa Ebi Swim in the Chillis. Ebi was crunchy and sufficiently spicy. Hong Shao Short Ribs were decent. I don't recommend the gyoza as they were stuck together. Tried to separate the gyozas but they inevitably fall apart.
5
I love to come here with my friends for lunch and even for coffee breaks. Great place in the CBD that is away from the hustle and bustle with good food. Beautiful interior and very comfortable. I tried most of their food items on the menu and loved everyone I tried.

We came down with a large group of friends in the evening. Our reservation was handled very professionally, and the food was interesting and enjoyable. Highlights were "Find the chicken in the chillies", the hot and sour chazuke, the Oriental Bolognese and the steak. Highly recommended

Amoy street is hot these days. Lots of cool new bars and restaurants, so I gave this place a chance for lunch. We shared a very small salad and had two surprisingly tiny "mains" with ice water for over 60 S$. Food was ok but nothing to write home about. Size and Prices are totally mismatched. Interior is great and has a good feel to it. Could have a lot of potential. Will not return.
