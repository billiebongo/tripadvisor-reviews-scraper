Fried dough fritters are crispy
Congee is fine & easy swallowing
Taste is flavourful
Meatballs are solid & easily breaks down without much effort to chew
Century eggs are a little too sour for my liking

Xin Mei serves a traditional Cantonese congee or porridge from rice that's been boiled in a superior stock for 4 hours from what I understand. They then prepare your specific order on the spot. We tried the pork congee (comes with sliced and minced pork) and the mixed pork congee (sliced and minced pork, pork balls, pork liver and pork small intestines). The congee came with half a fried dough fritter (yu char kway), which when eaten with the congee, provides just the right amount of crunch to balance the almost soupy like congee base. Flavours wise, the congee was good. However it was just a tad watery to be great. Overall a very decent dish if you're looking to experience a decent bowl of Cantonese style congee in a local hawker centre environment. Very reasonably priced at $3 a bowl.
