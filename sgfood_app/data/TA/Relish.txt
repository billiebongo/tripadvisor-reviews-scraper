Spam fries and spicy spaghetti with corned beef - perfect after a walk through the botanic gardens. Perfect for small tete a tetes, tea or brunch.

We haven't had a meal here in a few months and recently had an unplanned lunch here with family and friends. Was a lovely experience and we enjoyed a duck salad and several other dishes we meze-shared altogether. Great job and thank you.

Relish is a restaurant across the Botanic Gardens' Bukit Timah entrance that serves western food. They serve a variety of burgers and pasta along with other things. Food is ok but it could be better. Below is a photo of their eggs benedict.

Held our son‚Äôs first birthday here. Pre-ordered the mains and it all went without a hitch. Hot food for 18 people all at one go. Impressive. Spam fries and onion rings were favorite starters. Who doesn‚Äôt like luncheon meat??Staff were attentive despite a busy Saturday lunch crowd and nothing was too much for them. Very efficient and obliging. Matcha lava cake received a special thumbs up from our guests. No stinge-ing on portions - you could get full on mushroom soup

Burgers aren't as special as I remember.. especially in the context of the growing competition, relish hasn't upped their game. Brugerw were good but not special. Swiss mushroom probably the best choice. But service then should be better. Our waiter left half way of taking our order without explaining why and passed to someone else. Even getting attention was difficult. I think the jazz night was special but not the food or the service.
4
We ordered the blue cheese infused burger with poached pear, the seafood burger, spam fries and onion rings. Nothing could be faulted. There was only a hint of blue cheese in the burger, not overpowering, and the pear gave it sweetness and crunch. I wasn't sure about the seafood burger at first but it turned out to delicious. Seafood was mashed into a patty but still retained the chewiness and texture of individual ingredients. The onion rings came with a curry dip (delicious!) while the spam fries came with a horse radish mayo. Only drawback is the price. Our lunch came up to about $76
4
It was our first time to dine here and it was beyond our expectations. We ordered sweet potato fries that comes with a very nice curry dip. We also had the pesto pasta which is very good. Then we had the Bacon and Cheese burger which was excellent. They would ask how you want your burger to be cooked. We had ours as medium. Burgers includes fries or salads. They also server fresh fruit juices. They do have kids meals as well. The place is nice and quiet. You can relax while dining
5
having tried the burgers and pastas here on previous occasions, i fasted all morning so as to enjoy, guilt-free, the heavy pasta here. ordered the pancetta carbonara with onsen egg again, and it was still just as good. others had the breakfast burger and blue cheese & william burger, that were other favorites here as well, and they were just as nice. would suggest to make a reservation, or be faced with 30min/1hr waits at this popular weekend brunch stop
5
Easily one of my more favourite burger joints in Singapore. The service is great as is the variety on offer. Must try the onion rings. Unfortunately they discontinued their signature charcoal burger buns which unique. I am a frequent patron and come here monthly and am always happy to get my fill :

Friend live near by bought us there, not knowing that wss part of wild rocket until when we leave saw 4th he sign on the wall.We order sugar snap pea salad $14.80,sweet potato fries serve with curry mayo $9.30 , pancetta carbonara linguine with oneen egg on top $18.90, hae bee hian spaghetti $22.80, wild rocket beef burger $19.20.cappuccino $5.50.The food is nice, the hae bee hian spaghetti is interesting quite creative new first time try. Overall food is good price reasonable except salad and sweet potatoes fries a little pricey nothing special.Nice place for lunch food standard good
4
Not overpriced like many places, nice venue, airy with lots of sunshine. They don't leave salt and pepper or sugar on tables so if busy, good luck but apart from that, it's ok
4
Very good casual dining location. Good selection of burgers and a lot of interesting soft drinks such as variety of ice teas.
4
Nice restaurant that is brightly lit and industrial-style decor. The crabmeat linguine, beef burger and sangrias were the winners for us.
4
Great place nice ambient delicious food. Service there is here good, it's fast and very polite . I tried their breakfast and the hamburgers. And the bacon hamburger that I ate I really loved it. Highly recommend their burgers üçî
5
My friend and i shared a pesto pasta, mushroom soup and truffle fries. All were above average in terms of flavour. The ingredients used were fresh and generous, eg the basil in the pasta and truffle oil in the fries. Coffee smell great too but did not try as we dun drink coffee in the evening. Most of all the prices were reasonable. Abt 40 over bucks for the above. Service was quick and excellent. Place has an interesting decor and u can see parts of the botanical gardens from certain tables. This place is a gem, will definitely be back
4
Stopped in here for a late lunch. The restaurant is on the second floor of a small shopping centre near the Botanical Gardens SMRT station.We enjoyed the Chilli Crab burger and Pulled Duck Sandwich with Spam Fries. Thumbs up on the Chilli Crab burger. Take a pass on the Spam fries.Nice interior ambiance and good attentive service
3
Visited for Sunday brunch. Overall, I would have to say a well-intentioned restaurant, good quality ingredients, and fine food but generally nothing special.Best dish we had was a linguini carbonara. This was well done and I would order again without hesitation.My eggs Benedict was forgettable. Cute idea to serve it on a waffle, but nothing special. The dish fell flat for me.Kids said their burger was fine but didn't evoke the usual kid enthusiasm for a burger. Relish is mid-priced and I was fine with the quality ingredients at the price I paid. You probably would not be disappointed at Relish, so give it a try if you are keen.
5
If you wake up with a big appetite on a weekend, Relish at Cluny Court is the place to go to. They have a wide range of burgers which are perfect for a big breakfast or brunch. I tried the breakfast burger as well as the Char Siew burger. Both were absolutely fantastic. There are some sinful drinks as well with whipped cream on top. Parking is a bit of a pain with the underground car park having a very narrow entrance, making it a bit of a tight squeeze for big cars
3
Let me say this about Relish: it is a hidden little gem of a place with nice ambience, a polite staff, and a very friendly vibe -- think big coffee shop meets burger bar with salads and mochas. I like Relish...But Relish is no longer the best burger in S'pore. What used to set Relish apart from the others is the use of Wagyu or Kobe beef in their burgers, but not this latest iteration. The beef was dry, unseasoned, not very tasty, and the bun looked like it'd been sourced from the Cold Storage downstairs. We ordered six burgers and nothing stuck out beyond the average range. Sorry, Relish... we'll be back for salads and coffees, but we're going to Alt.Pizza for our burgers..
4
This cafe is not visible from the road, as it's on level 2 of Cluny Court , a small mall opposite Botanic Gardens. The ambience is a clean & relaxed setting, with plenty of natural light coming thru the glass panels. The breakfast set is $10.50 (including tax) with a choice of egg, bread & coffee/tea. I had sourdough, eggs on onsen style with a hot latte. Thumbs up for taste !
3
This place has been around for a few years so it's not one of the new burger places that is cashing in on the new burger trend. The burgers here are ok and there are many different types to choose from.
4
Nice location.
Food is obviously prepared with attention to detail.
The freshness of ingredients makes us feel very comfortable with this place.
Service is also professional and warm.
4
Great burgers and great service. Slightly pricey. A must try is the spam fries. We ordered the blue cheese, peanut butter burger..which was great taste, but can get a little overwhelming.The char siew burger was good, but would have preferred it with a burger bun, and less sauce (which made the focaccia bread a litlle too moist and mushy
3
The restaurant was quite good in terms of the quality of their food. However, watch the fine print, if you notice on the menu in very small print you just stated prices are subject to tax and service charge. There is no mention that it is a 10% service charge. Please note they do not accept American Express. Also my debit card was charged twice which they said do not go through however my bank confirmed that it did go through I had to reject the payment this was annoying. Salads, burgers, and your choice of beers was superb. Signature dish cherry cheesecake was the topper , it was superb. Just watch out for the small print I think that if they charge 10% service , the service should be better than average it, was not
4
If you are looking for a place to relax and enjoy a good meal this is the one. Relish at Cluny court great menu and good service to go along with it. Great place to take the family or meet friends for a coffee or a meal. Enjoy

This is a handy pitstop if you live in the neighbourhood or are visiting the Botanic Gardens next door.There are a few ModSin (modern Singapore) dishes on the menu and the restaurant (together with its sister restaurant Wild Rocket) should be applauded for leading the way on this. Some of the ModSin dishes you could try are the char siew burger (char siew being grilled pork loin that has been marinated in Chinese hoisin sauce and honey) and hae bee hiam pasta (hae bee hiam is a chilli paste made with dried shrimp).This evening we had the Wild Relish burger and the cheese and bacon burger. You get to choose either fries or salad on there side. While the burgers were competently put together and tasted fine as a whole, the meat patties we thought were too dry and compact - I think this is what happens when you squish the patties down when cooking and in so doing dry them out. So Relish gets a average rating as the burgers are meant to be the star items.Other dishes we had:The sugar snap peas salad and onion rings were pretty good for sharing. And the fries were delicious - extra crispy and not oily.The restaurant has a cosy laid back vibe and is nicely fitted out. Service was competent
4
Just had a lovely lunch at Relish, very easy to locate, just next to Botanic Gardens MRT station. Located on the 2nd floor. The Mushroom & cheese burger was juicy and the Hae Bee Hiam Spaghetti was excellent. Finished of the meal with their signature strawberry cheese cake and the Melaka waffle was crunchy and served with a scoop of coconut ice cream.
4
Located next to the Botanic Garden MRT, this cafe is tucked in a quiet corner on the second floor. There's a few cafes in this building that serve mainly an expat crowd or the rich folks from the vicinity, but this is probably the one with the best value for money. It's a great quiet place to chill, read or have a meeting.

We came to Cluny Court intending to go for De Paulo's Gastromania but it was just too crowded.We decided to try out Relish by Wild Rocket and it was a delightful surprise! The menu comprised of dishes that are interesting blends of western food with local infusions e.g. the Soft Shell Chilli Crab Burger.The burgers here are really good and they're definitely what you should order when you're here. We tried the Wild Rocket Beef Burger (S$19.20) and the BBQ Char Siew Pork Burger (S$21.40).I loved the Sarawak pepper cream which rendered a slightly spicy taste to the burger while my hubby practically devoured the BBQ Char Siew Pork. No photos are available for these two as we were simply too hungry and we couldn't wait for the burgers to jump into our mouths.For dessert, I tried their signature dish, the Strawberry Cheesecake (S$9.80), and it was not bad. A bit cloying for me but the tartness of the strawberry preserve evened it out. Now that my hunger pangs were sated after the burgers, I was able to take a photo of the dessert.Our total bill came up to S$70.62, very much on the ex side, especially when we're used to eating hawker fare for weekend lunches, but Relish was indeed a new and pleasant experience. We will definitely come back again.Tip: Water is available but you'll have to get it yourself at the counter. They have coloured cups for the kiddos too
3
Set on the second floor of Cluny Court, this second restaurant of Wild Rocket provides a relax environment for brunch, lunch and dinner. We came by after a reception nearby and the place was still empty. We had their beef burgers, BBQ Char Siew Burgers and truffles fries. Burger was good and craft beer in bottles are available. Good stop for food and coffee if you are looking for a rest stop after visiting Botanic Gardens next door.
4
Located next to Botanic Gardens MRT, this is a great place to chill out with the family. Good natural lights and bright open spaces make this a relaxing environment.
4
Had the well known burger which was ok. No frills but tasty. Didn't like the fries. The other dish was the linguine carbonara with onsen egg which was not bad.
3
We'd heard this was THE burger place in town, so a friend and I stopped by. It was average, nothing special. The service was ok, the ambiance was ok, trying to be trendy but no quite there. Not somewhere I'd visit again.
4
Had an excellent (memorable) curry dish. Very homey and relaxed. Fair prices. The air conditioning was pleasant (not too cold). Will go back for sure.

We were a party of 7 for a casual lunch, we each ordered a main & some of us had drinks, others just wanted iced water. This is what happened:1) when we asked for iced water, the waiter told us it was on the counter, without offering to bring it, so we helped ourselves. they only brought a couple of carafes later.2) the waiter had to return at least twice to re-confirm our orders: 7 mains & 5 drinks for 7 people, no shared food or special requests outside of what was in the menu.3) 6 of the mains came first, & we had to wait an at least another 10 mins for the 7th. no explanation was given, neither were we informed in advance - it was a burger, nothing fancy.4) we asked for separate bills, & was not told there would be a problem. after waiting patiently for at least 15 mins, staff came with only 4 of the bills. we had to wait another 5-10 mins for the rest. & another 5-10 mins for everyone's cards to be returned.5) the food was tasty, & no one had any complains. but the overall service experience was appalling, considering the prices charged - each main course averaged $20 - $25, & $7-8 for a soft drink.6) feedback about the poor service was given to the waiter as we left - no apology was offered, just a rather weak "the manager is new" & something about the system not being able to cope!7) Suggestion - better customer service training for staff, & clearer communications with diners. & if you have to make them wait, at least let them know what's going on & offer them a complementary drink!I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone or visit again in the near future, unless I can be sure of service quality

Having read good reviews my wife and I recently dropped by for lunch. Admittedly the establishment has plenty of space and excellent natural light and the staff are friendly. We both ordered the cheese burger which whilst well presented was difficult to cut and was quite chewy. This was communicated to the staff but no real apology was offered.The prices are on the high side, especially the beers which cost S$15 a bottle
4
The restaurant sports a modern contemporary look. It has pretty good acoustics - soft mainstream music can be heard clearly even with the chatter of diners.Food offered is a fusion of Asian and Western cuisines. I enjoyed the onion rings dipped in curry sauce and chicken wings with Thai sauce. The churro waffles with chocolate sauce is good too
5
I had lunch here for the first time today. I made reservations via phone. We had the wild rocket burger, mushroom and cheese burger, coconut and gula melaka milkshake, flat white, onion rings and churros waffle. We both enjoyed our burgers which came with a healthy serving of beef (you can choose how well you want it and medium was perfect for me, also a choice of fries or salad). The milkshake which my friend had was supposedly great, while I prefer my flat white stronger and less acidic. Onion rings were decent with a very tasty curry sauce on the side. I loved the churros waffles though a teensy dry, had a perfect cinnamon sugar coating. Paired with chocolate, it made for a good dessert without tasting overly heavy. Service was really good - staff were attentive and very pleasant. It was a pleasure dining here and I will be back for more. The bill was about $95 for 2 persons.
5
When you walk in to Relish, you get the feeling you're going to enjoy the experience. It's a big, bright and airy restaurant with attentive staff (thank you!) and a good simple menu with interesting burger varieties their speciality. We had a nice fresh caesar salad and a bacon burger and both were well prepared and cooked just nicely (not the salad). A glass of house red washed it down. We liked the fact that the management for this place hasve not jammed in too many tables, making the ambiance very pleasant. We will be back. Recommendation to the kitchen: hand cut hot chips (rather than the frozen variety served) would be perfect ;
4
It is located at cluny court, just across the road from botanic garden MRT station and entrance. The service is good, food is good too. Price are a little bit on the high side but it is worth it i feel. Try the beef burger. :D and their mushroom soup:
4
Went there with friend and tried the pulled pork burger and chicken wings.Pulled Pork Burger - tender cha siew taste with only 1 patty so as not to overload the carbo. Good serving size!Chicken wings - a plate of 4 wings is just not enough for 2 of us. We ordered a second plate! Love the sweet spicy char taste, savoury and finger licking good. Almost ordered a 3rd plate Hah
3
we had a salad and sweet potato fries and burger and it was good. Nice atmosphere and the staff tried really hard despite there being a bit of a hiccup with ordering and what was being delivered at a few tables. I really like the feel of the restaurant. The food is okay, a bit expensive for what it is.. but thats Singapore. Nice coffee too. A good place to meet friends for lunch
4
Simple n relaxed place for really good burgers. Hubby n I love burgers n got recommended to Relish by a friend. Do remember to make a reservation, even on a weekday night. Dinner started with a mushroom soup. It is thick with real mushroom goodness. If u r a mushroom soup lover like me, u will like this. Relish Beef Burger n Ram Lee Burger were next. Their beef burger is simple n yet u can taste the freshness of the beef patty. Patty is of the right thickness n cooked to the right texture. Ram Lee burger is rich with egg, cheese, onion, etc. satisfied my craving! Added $3 for Truffle fries. BURP! Dessert time. We opted for the Melaka waffle. The coconut ice cream is good. Waffle can be better. Drinks wise, I ordered the Lychee Mojito. Hmmm.... Disappointed with the taste. Overall, it's a good place for burgers!!!

We had been here a couple of years ago but were not terribly impressed with the food. Last night we patronised it again and were pleasantly surprised at how much the food quality had improved.My pear n cheese burger was wonderful- chunky thick beef patty with melted cheese buried in the middle, paired with slices of sweet poached pear that balanced out the richness of the beef and cheese. Shredded rocket lettuce leaves added a tinge of bitterness which enhanced the overall taste experience.My daughter's spaghetti came with big juicy meatballs which were tasty and well seasoned. My husband ordered a starter dish of Marmite chicken wings which actually tasted much better than I expected- crispy, not overly salty, with a tinge of caramelly sweetness. A palatable blend of flavours which enhanced the juiciness of the chicken meat. The restaurant was full house as it was Friday night and there seemed to be a shortage of waiters but we were served by polite and friendly young staff who did not seem overly flustered by the crowd. Compliments to them for keeping their cool.If the restaurant can consistently produce food of this calibre, we will be back more often
4
Menu choice was not that great, but love the ambience. Had some vouchers to spend thus bring down the pricing of food. Start as early as 9am for breakfast till night.Love their egg Benedicts which was served on waffles. Just nice the portion not too much.Their Portobello Mushroom burger was a wee bit too over cooked thus a bit dry.Fish & Chips were quite fresh but nothing extraordinary Overall understaffed.Patronized mainly by expats. Great location as it is on 2nd floor of Cluny Court next to the Botanical Garden MRT which is on Circle Line.Currently on offers on Groupon...so grab some cheap vouchers to enjoy it
2
We've been there a couple of times, and no escaping the ambiance. Thought we'd go back and have a go at the new dishes, and if I recall it right, it was the soft cooked eggs, and mushrooms priced at $18, which came in a large plate but small serving. And there was the pandan french toast which was good.While the food was good, I'd say my take-away was it wasn't worth the $18 dollars. Sadly, that impression stuck when I was a Carvers for brunch and realized the huge serving of fish and chips was priced the same. That's when you start comparing the menu prices, and asking yourself if it's within your comfort zone for a weekend meal.It might be the right price for an expat rich zone, but I'd prefer the Carvers, Artichokes, etc
2
We had a late lunch at Relish. The food was terrible. The burger was dry, the fries were not tasty.The soup was a thick sauce. The waitress only looked at her ipad and was not really friendly. The location is very nice just on the other side of the Botanical garden situated in a lovely old charming house. Not recommende
4
Stumbled upon this place while out with family. Ordered the wild rocket beef burger, really enjoyed it especially the spicy sweetness from what I presume is the Sarawak pepper cream. At S$9.8 this was very reasonable as it came with a decent portion of chips. Steak sandwich on the other hand was a little dry and not as tasty. Would return, though will only stick to the burger
2
I came here under the impression that relish was famous for its burgers and after several years, I finally decided to give it a try. For a place that prides itself on its burgers, I was woefully disappointed. The burger was room temperature, underseasoned and not cooked to my requested level of doneness (medium) and overall, very bland. The fries weren't seasoned and also close to room temperature and being a professional chef, I have no problem recognizing cheap frozen fries when I see them, which these were. Perhaps I'm too picky as I am the first person to admit that I have relatively high standards in burgers but in all honesty, Carls Junior does a better job than relish in every single aspect of the burger game...except maybe for ambience. If mcdonalds and burgerking are your benchmarks for burgers then by all means, give relish a try, but otherwise stick to carls junior.Food aside, the ambience of the place is quite pleasant and the food is also relatively affordable considering the setting and location. However, service was unattentive which was unacceptable considering it was a very slow night with few customers. Had to ask for water twice and when they finally came they neglected to bring a cup. All in all, a very disappointing dining experience. However, if youre looking for a relatively affordable restaurant with nice ambience and kid friendly food, give relish a try
5
Whenever I‚Äôm craving a ‚ÄòBurger Experience‚Äô it‚Äôs hard to beat Relish - simple and casual, but hits the spot. Having been to the Relish in Serangoon Gardens while visiting friends, I was curious to try out the restaurant in Cluny Court and was not disappointed! This Relish makes great use of its environment through its gigantic windows- great for people watching! My classic choice is The Beef and Smoky Bacon Burger with melted emmental cheese, but there are also more unconventional and adventurous choices like Seafood Burger, both of which could be paired with a recommended beer. Pudding was great as well, one of my favourites being the Strawberry Cheese Cake
5
Their Char Siew Pork Open Foccacia Burger is a must try!!!Unbelievably good,the char Siew meat is so tender and juicy,bursting with flavourful oil in your mouth?Cannot get enough of it,will be trying their Ram-Lee Burger on the next visit.
3
Always wanted to try food at Wild Rocket so decided to pop down to MyVillage @Serangoon gardens, a short drive away from my place. Perhaps my expectations were high, so was really looking for something outstanding. Still, my family and found it a nice place to have lunch or dinner, or catch up with your friends in a friendly environment. Food was above average and priced reasonably.Worth the try if in the vicinity
4
Relish is a nice restaurant located near Serene centre. Whenever my wife feels nostalgic about her school days, I would bring here for a casual dinner. The decor is quite trendy and the crew are quite friendly. The menu offers a variety of burgers, grilled dishes and pastas along with mouth-watering milk shakes. I love their fried wings and onion rings. The buttermilk batter fried wings with blue cheese dip is really unique. The onion rings are slices of fresh onions dipped in a batter and deep fried upon order comes with curry mayo dip is also buck-the-trend dish. The food was delicious and the service was good. Overall, a good place to have a casual dinner if you're ditching the city to dine at a place that's quiet and trendy.
4
I recently took my family here on a random weekday for lunch and we loved it! Their burgers came recommended and definitely did not disappoint. However I was pleased to see the unique items they had on the menu...spam fries, char sui pork burger on focaccia, etc! Great selection of beers but the hand crafted cocktails took some time to deliver.Staff were quite pleasant and I will definitely be back.Note: They do not accept American Express
2
This burger place has expanded its menu to include a variety of non-burger menu. We have been to this place more than a dozen times whenever we need a burger fix. But lately, we noticed that they had increase their price - a blue cheese 180 g burger with sunny side and bacon will set you back by S$32.60 with minimum service. The drinks and desserts are also getting pricey for a casual dinning place. The service is robotic. We are really sad that one of our favourite burger places is going down hill
2
Went at the weekend after sometime away overseas.....and it wasn't as good as previouslyConfusing indicating a brunch menu on the walls yet when checking, everything is on the ala carte menu..Pork burger was very fatty and frankly nothing special, crab pasta was good and the best choice amongst the four of us.Service mediocr
3
We went on a Sunday evening and it was surprisingly empty, only a few tables filled. I had a beef and bacon cheeseburger (you can choose either a salad or fries to accompany it). The burger was stacked high, but small in diameter. Nonetheless, I found it quite filling. Taste-wise, the burger was so-so. The best parts were the tomato relish and (of course) the bacon. The beef patty was tough on the outside and pink inside...My friend had the Asian-inspired turnip-cucumber-mango salad. It had a generous serving of fair-sized prawns, but the mango was conspicuous by its absence! Two tiny slivers of mango, compared to huge shavings of (local) turnip and cucumber! But it still tasted good.The brunch menu looked interesting, so maybe I'll go back and give that a try. It does look a little more extensive than the dinner menu
2
Food was ok but the service is beyond bad and I won't go back. One waiter literally didn't know how and couldn't open a screw top wine bottle. The team of four waitstaff prefer to talk at the bar than serve the (only) three tables occupied in the restaurant. I am not surprised why the restaurant was so empty on a Friday night with this type of service and a manager that doesn't have a clue. This place was ok a couple of years ago but had gone downhill fast. I've added this to my steer clear list.
4
Relish is relatively no frills but the service is excellent, the burgers are great and there's a good selection of sides.Don't go expecting a huge gastronomic experience and in general it's best to stick to the more 'traditional' burgers. The seafood burger in particular was a little strange although still well cooked.If you're hungry and in the mood for a good burger in a nice setting, Relish hits the spot
3
I went over to try burger because I've got some craving for it. The price is quite reasonable but the burger itself isn't.The fries is good, the beer is good, the onion rings is good but the burger is a little too tough for me. I think it could do better. Nonetheless, worth a try and generally, I still enjoy myself there with a good and friendly service
4
A fun place for brunch on weekends or lunch anytime - yum burgers - hand-made - excellent shakes. Fab breakfasts for early or late risers on weekends. We visit often.
5
Willin brought classic western cuisine and infused it with local flavor that not only tasted good, it is fun as well.
1
The staff was rude and unresponsive. It took us more than 20 mins to have our drinks order taken. Will never return again.
4
only my second time at Relish. I found the Burger beef cooked Medium just right. The Relish burger sauce was an interesting blend, which I had not tasted before. Sweet and not too spicy. Definitely worth the wait. I was getting a little impatient with the unhurried preparation of my burger, so I was pleasantly relieved with a thoughtfully prepared burger. Spent $69 for relish burger. Egg plant spaghetti. Rich cheese cake and 2 non-alcoholic drinks. A little costly but I will probably be back for some refreshing Cuisine
4
i visited the branch in serangoon, it was cozy and quiet, interiors are relaxing too. i order an appetizer burger and dessert. the thai grilled chicken salad was so-so, chicken was bland and dry. it was difficult to mix the salad and get the dressing into the chicken because the slicing of the cucumber, or the chicken is cut too big. i order the burger for mains, it has almond peanut butter w/c is something new to a burger, (works well for me) blue d'avuergne, & williams pear. there's alot of taste going on my palate, sweet, salty, and umami... w/c i give a 2 thumbs whoever created the burger. for dessert i had the gateau, which the gateau itself speaks for the price, it was average. but the addition of caramelized banana is the one that gives justice to make it interesting. service was excellent. hope to come back soon
5
Do not drive your large SUV or MPV into the Cluny Court basement car park if you do not want to spoil your lunch. The turns are tight in the basement and you might have to wait as it is a small car park. The burgers here are exceptionally good and some in local flavours viz ramly burger and they also serve bee thye mak as a pasta. I had a teriyaki tuna salad which was tasteful with the cheese cake in a cup, the high point. Service was so so. When I asked for a thick piece of paper to be slotted under the leg of the rickety table, the waiter was not sure what to do. He also dropped a knife on the chair when clearing the plates and there was not a word of apology. Good value for the food though
4
On holiday in Singapore with children and looking for a burger? Visit Relish. It's on the edge of the Botanic Gardens in a small shopping strip in a colonial style building. Take the escalator near the supermarket up to Level 1. Great furniture, good sized tables and magazines to read if you're dining solo. The first waiter that served us delivered the wrong wine twice. However, I saw it was the end of her shift and she was probably tired. The second waiter surprised and delighted us. He chatted with my children, gave them pencils and paper to draw with and provided a discrete service to the adults. Burgers were delicious, a small wine list but what I selected worked with the burger
4
We went there for brunch on a Saturday. They have all day brunch menu and a good kids menu. It was very child friendly. We took the stroller and they accommodated us. You can access it by the lift. There were a lot of other kids too with their parents making for a relaxed atmosphere. The burger was very good but ask for it well-done as they automatically do it medium-rare (unless that is your thing). Bit more expensive but given quality red meat is expensive in Singapore it makes sense. Skip the cheap burgers at other places and pay a bit more here. The service was ok.. staff were very nice but there weren't enough of them for the number of customers. The expresso wasn't very good but I'm finding coffee in Singapore in general is not fantastic (you defn have to choose your place carefully)
4
The burgers are prepared to perfection ! I personally love their sinful fries . It is an ideal weekend family eating place . Parking at Cluny Court may be tricky but Serene center next door may be an alternative , then you can pop into Island Creamery to finish off with their amazing flavor ice cream.
5
Great place to have brunch. Nice decor, quick and attentive service, good value for money, good choice of menu items, and more importantly, the food tastes great! Dined at both the bukit timah and serangoon garden outlets and both were equally good! Worth a trip if you're hungry for tasty food

Don't make a special trip here. But if you have a group of friends who are rowdy, this is a good place. The ambience is nice.

Freshly made, excellent burgers that beat those served at twice the cost elsewhere in town.

So-so burgers.
Nice variety of burgers and beers.
Waiters seemed overwhelmed.
Burgers at nearby Swiss Butchery are much better

Burgers are generally fine, with a goodMeat. It's nice because you can choose your side (fries or salad), but their could be more of the side in general. Very limited choice of desserts but beers and wines are very varied. Overall, a good experience. Take a jacket as the air on is turned on big time

This is the second time we went there for a relaxed family outing. Convenient parking, nice design, roomy with view over Bukit Timah.The burgers are definitely good.And the service is definitely bad. We waited a good 10 minutes for someone to show up to take our order. They delivered short. Taking an order for 3 people is not rocket science.In their defense, thenplace was packed. But the last time we were there, there was nobody. The service was still slow

Ordered the Relish Burger and it was superb. Beef was done just right and its hard to describe but you can taste the freshness of the ingredients. Loved the Gula Melaka/coconut milkshake. Creamy and fragrant and probably the only place that serves this.Will be back for more

Great burgers! The Wild rocket burger is super - juicy patty and fresh fragrant leaves! The hae bee hiam pasta is a novelty. Local spicy dried prawn sambal with pasta.The Horlicks and Milo marble cake was a tad dry and needed more of the delicious creamy topping

Far better burgers available further along Bukit Timah Road at Bar Bar Black Sheep at nearly half the price. Different atmosphere however, as Bar Bar is more pub-like and open air- and can get crowded. Relish is more for affluent upper middle class Singaporeans who never leave their air conditioned environments.Relish is just across from the new MRT station at Botanical Gardens, so if you want a burger and can't wait until you get somewhere else, and don't mind spending $20 for it, then its ok. I would not go regularly however

The prices are on the high side, especially so when the portions are not big. I had a Sunday lunch with my family once and I am not sure but I was paying for. The service is also inconsistent.On another occasion, I was at the door of the restaurant at about 7 pm on a weekday. At least 2 waiters/ waitresses came near the door, saw me poring through the menus but none even bothered to acknowledge my presence. That left a very sour taste with me and it would take a lot to persuade me to visit the place again

The food here is nothing to rave about. You can find the same quality of food with same ambience in many places popping up in Singapore.  Would stop by if I am near again but would not go out of the way to eat there, or recommend to a friend. Service was bad, with servers acting half a sleep. Only the manger(?) was quick on her feet and alert

love this place. be sure to be adventurous and try their menu that combine food in creative ways that makes sense.

Yummy Gourmet burgers and other eats :)

good for a lazy lunch if you have times..pretty good menu selection. A little pricey however ...

For a burger joint selling only burgers, I was certainly far from impressed. The patty was dry and not juicy at all. Not worth the money.

Burgers and beer.

pricey burger better at Carls Junior

Great burgers - love the Mexicana and the Seafood burger! Also great beer-pairings to complement your burger. Kid-friendly, and I like that the chicken strips from the kids' menu is from whole chicken pieces and not some mashed up processed mince.

Yummy Burgers,melt in your mouth patties

Paying $18 for a relatively small burger and side hurts a little but the taste and fantastic service makes up for it. The burgers were delicious though I recommend ordering one of the more gourmet ones, not the simple bacon and cheese. It just didn't measure up to the bleu cheese and william pear burger I ordered, though it was good. The fries are amazing, and the onion rings are quite tasty. The beer selection (not the normal Tiger bit) was great and the 2 beers we ordered we wonderful. Service was some of the best I've had in Singapore to date
2
THe burgers were pretty good, however 2 burger, 2 beers, and bowl of soup for $75 is a bit much. The managers of this restaurant really need to work on the service, it was pretty bad. I am not sure if we will be returning to the restaurant
4
juicy lamb pita burger and hummus dressing was spot on. could have been more generous with the dressing though. well paired with the recommended beer too.
3
If you're wanting a burger in a non greasy environment, go here. The cheesecake dessert's good too!
4
Love the burgers...so juicy!!!
4
da best burgers! Try the one wrapped in egg and mayo!
3
lively, noisy atmosphere. food above average. parking horrendous.
2
The burger wasn't anything spectacular and didn't meet my expectations, especially having made 3 trips down (first 2 futile) just to try the newly opened burger restaurant. The food was served only slightly warm and turned cold really quickly. Definitely not value for money.
3
Not quite above average, but still rather reliable for decent burgers. Skip the desserts and shakes, they sound very promising (e.g. coconut shake with gula melaka) but are not.
4
Juicy burgers without the grease. Try their Ram-lee version!!!

Ok so before you go you should know it's not a greasy joes so yes the burger is going to cost a little more than macdonalds or a hawker center. But cmon - if you love a good home made pattie, crispy bacon, tasty sauces in a contemporary surrounding you'll be right at home. Go for the bacon burger alone which is worthy. I didn't try the other combinations of which were good by my brain to taste-bud assessment. My only gripe is there is no soy milk for a latte but a dopio was just as good. This is nowhere near the east so a weekend place for me. Afterwards go shopping outside for overpriced antiques with other expat couples and if you can't handle that go to the deli for fresh pasta/cheese or cold storage downstairs and get your groceries

The beef burgers here are really good though somewhat pricey. I tried the curry chicken burger the other day and I would say to give it a miss. The gloppy curry mayo accompanying the dry minced chicken burger does not give good mouth feel let alone taste BUT all the beef burgers tried so far at Relish have been deelish! A real fave with our kids too as they have 3 dedicated kids' meals to choose from. A definite new haunt of ours
