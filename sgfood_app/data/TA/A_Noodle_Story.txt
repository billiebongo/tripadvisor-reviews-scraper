Went to the store today and wondered where have I been my entire life. First time trying the noodles and actually loved the delicious taste of the charsiew and the noodles itself. Would definitely recommend!

Their bowl of Singaporean Ramen is an eye opener! The noodles are springy, the pork soft, egg is delicious, and the prawn crispy.
Go extremely early if you want to score a bowl. They have different sizes to cater to various appetites.

Was recommended by colleagues to try this since it’s very near our office. The queue is Long but moving fast so it’s ok to queue. The moment you receive it, the presentation is so appealing, it just doesn’t feel like it’s food from hawker centre. Personally I love the crispy prawn and the noodles leave its mark as the traditional wanton noodle. The saffron replaces the usual cut red/green chilli. I love this switch, it gives it quite a nice twist. However, with the char siew and runny egg that reminds me of Japanese ramen, I just find the dish a bit confusing. Will I queue again for this $7 dish? Probably only when I have the craving

So perfect it almost look plastic Hidden gem at Amoy Street Food Centre which I regret to only find after working 8 months at Tanjong Pagar. Worth every single cent and time spent on queuing for this bowl of delicious goodness. Expect to queue at least 20-30min during lunch time! Hurry before they sell out for the day! Comes in $7,$9,$13.

After queuing for a an hour, and paying $9 for a bowl of noodles... I think I could have spend my time and money elsewhere for lunch.The meat and wanton is good, but the noodle just taste plain n simple as I would get from any other store.If you really want to try, go in the evening where the q is shorter

This is nice but the portion quite small for big eater. it is a mixed of local noodles and Japanese char siew and onsen egg. Taste wise it is good, for the $$ that I paid, i feel it is value of it. The wait for the noodle is long, so for me who tried once, i won't go to queue for that unless any of the companion die die want to try

Went there for lunch today and as was told that queue is very long during lunch time, a friend and I went there at 11.20 am and the queue was already 15 persons ahead of us. A small bowl costs $7 and a medium bowl costs $9. We had the $7 ones. It came with noodles (like the thickness of angel hair), two char siew (pork belly) which is very delicious that almost melt in the mouth, two pieces of wanton (dumpling with prawns and minced pork), very fresh and juicy, a piece of potato prawn, very crispy and nice and scallon. The noodles were nice and delicious with chilli sauce. The order came with a bowl of soup. It really worth the queue as the blow of noodles and soup really blow us away. I will go again when I have the chance

Probably best ramen I have ever tried, each element of the dish is chosen and prepared with high standard so when people say it's just a noodle I say go to 'just a noodle place' and leave this place to food lovers. Tip:go there few minutes before opening and you won't be waiting that long. Bravo!

I went to try this when I had a movie gathering with my friends. At first, I was expected a tasty noodle after saw the picture. Turns out, I will just give rate 3 out of 5 star. The taste just so so. I order the spicy noodle, but what I get is literally just spicy taste, no salt, no other flavor, just spicy. So, if someone ask me will I be back? Erm... not sure, but most probably no

It is opening hours is limited, hence making everyone frantically queuing up for it ..food in such a situation, becomes less enjoyable esp after a long standing in the queue (all thanks to the Bib Gourmand since 2016 ?!)While the medium bowl costs S$9 , it is considered quite highly priced in a non-airconditioned settingThe ramen has just one piece of prawn for the medium bowl?! Lose the saffron then to make it more affordableThe potato wrapped prawn is creative but not sure the need to have the potatao, while many love the Japanese-style braised char su, it is a tad too fatty for me, sorry!The wantan (dumpling) definitely makes the story goes on and the queue lengthens! It puts many self-proclaimed Hongkong style noodle restaurants to shame!It deserved a 3.5 star indeed but its horrifying an hour+ long queue loses away the 0.5 star just like my sweat loses and temper loses in the queue

very tasty noodle.if dont want to queue must be there before 11:15am to wait,otherwise will have to wait more than 30mins to get the noodles.

I reached there just before 10.30am, and I was third in line. Foodies started to flow in and joined the queue. They started taking orders at 10.40am and I got mine at 10 mins later.All the wait was worth while. I liked everything in the bowl. Char siew was tender and flavorful, the potato wrapped prawn was crispy (fried upon order), texture of the noodle was springy. Liked the wanton, the generous portion of spring onions, not forgetting the onsen egg and the chili paste. Must tr

Unlucky for me that they run out the charsiu, so they replace it with other components.With only 5 person in front of us, it took more than half hour to put our order, so don't even think to try this noodle when you are starving.This is the only stall in the Amoy St. Food Court that has queue. Be reminded that this is a hawker food, so don't expect cozyness but comfortable.This noodle is like art, the seller cooks everything freshly and places every component neatly, that is why the queue is that long.The noodle is smooth, all components are tasty and the chilli also very nice.. I like it.Will I be returning to this place again ? No...because of the queue time, but if there is no queue definitely I will....!

This is one of the best Hawker style bowls I've had. Everything is on point, from the noodle texture, to the wantons' filling.It could do with a bit of extra-speed on the "assembly" line, but well worth the $7 "premium". If wait is not too Long, do try.

After 10 days in Singapore eating our way thought our carefully researched hit list of the superstar and emerging hawker stalls, this stall stood out as the one that was worth queuing for. Based in a corner at Amoy Food Centre, we queued for 1/2 hr and were fortunately to be the last order before they ran out at lunchtime. Presentation was stunning and each of the elements added to the one dish on the menu (you can choose two sizes - we paid $7). We loved the wontons and the prawn wrapped in a crispy potato ribbon. The ramen and onsen egg were flavourful. Best noodle stand at a hawker centre in SG in our opinion - A Noodle Story deserve to do well because they are elevating hawker food to a new level. An amazing dish for the money. While you're waiting in the queue, grab a black pepper chicken curry puff from J2 famous crispy curry puff in the next row of stalls. They're definitely worth your money too

This is one of the most special noodle places I've been to in Singapore. It was very creative. The taste was good, but not great. I found it a bit too greasy. Definitely worth trying.Tip: the stall opens at 5:30 in the evening. If you arrive 15 minutes before you may be the first in the queue so the wait won't be long

Was there 11.30am Friday, about 10 people in front, waited 30 mins. Ordered $7 small but portion is just nice (considered I'm not small eater). Love the fried prawn wrapped with potato n freshness of prawn wanton. Noodles still QQ even after turning cold as you eat. Char Siew (pork) a bit fatty but acceptable. Overall feel 30 mins queue is worth it! Recommend!

First in line on a Saturday morning during our second attempt to try this Michelin Bib awardee.Ordered the noodle and the wonton as a side order.Love the wonton with a good chunk of shrimp and pork.The noodle was a confusion of HK (wonton), Japanese (tamago onsen, char Sui) and fried shrimp with potato wrapped around. I still enjoyed the bowl of freshly prepared noodle for brunch

A small bowl cost S$7 consists of a good portion of fine string noodle, 2 plump size wanton, 2 slice of porks (chashu), and a prawn wrapped with potato strips, and a small bowl of soup.The noodle was good, overall very filling for me. My friend prefers their prawn while I prefer the wanton. To each of liking, my friend finds the food especially wanton slightly savoury.The chillies is not those sliced chillies nor wet paste. Its like the traditional kind where we mixed it with the noodle. Not spicy.Anyway with the such price, we wont go for it as our usual meal. Only if we crave for it which i doubt we rarely will.But good jobs and heart for the youngsters

only by picture, you will be surprised to know that this is located at Food Centre. every each component in the bowl taste like the cook put his soul into it. but it's not halal in case you have no idea about the meat they use.

The Singapore-style ramen seemed more to me like a Japanese-style Wanton Mee. It still tastes pretty good and has generous portions of dumplings and other toppings. More expensive compared to its hawker counterparts but still considered very affordable.

The noodle is springy, the pork slice is juicy, the broth is tasty. Be prepared for long queue of upto 1 hour. Self-service.

This isn't a new place to eat at; in the grand scheme of things, it took me a while to finally dine here. Amoy Street Food Centre is fairly empty during weekday dinner time, but by the time I slurped my last spoonful at 6:30PM, there was a line of about 10 people!There's only 1 dish at A Noodle Story: "Singapore Style Ramen". All you need to do is tell them what size you want: Small ($7) or Medium ($9). The difference between the 2 is the amount of ingredients; shown above is the Medium cos, y'know, #Bui. So this dish has al dente thin ramen noodles, melt in your mouth char siew, prawn wanton, crispy fried potato-wrapped prawn, perfect ramen egg. The soup is also quite something-- flavourful, & way above the average salty AF crummy soup you get in hawker centres with your noodle dishes.Overall, very big in flavour. I enjoyed it! I believe you can opt for the non-spicy version, but I left mine as the original & it was just spicy enough for me.

Check on hours before you go and get there early .. every delicious part of this bowl of goodness was amazing and if the line wasn't so long i would have bought another one .. if you don't buy 2 at least get the large . Enjoy ... I'm hungry right now just thinking about i

Good ramen with delicious cha su (their version of bbq pork but braised !) a delicious big wanton and a prawn wrapped around by noodles Very yummy and because of your ratings and newspaper food hunters, they can afford to charge you $7 for a small and $9 for a medium . you can add more if you are hungryI would like to congratulate these 2 young entrepreneurs whom have taken on serving good food at food courts . They deserve to expand their business and be like the dou chicken michelin food stall proprietor whom has become a millionaire ! This is what Singapore needs more - food designers and food that is not out of reach for the average Joe like me. only setback of this eatery is the food is not all appealing to the western tourists and the long q during lunchtime and there is only one food preparer and one cashier ! you serve yourself and by the way if you could during peak lunch hour, worry about finding a seat if you re not the selfish type whom put a tissue pack to secure a table /place whilst others with food ready to be eaten have to struggle to find a place to sit and eat their meal Hence , lower your expectations and be prepared for a long wait for your noodles

That's basically what these guys do, and perhaps a lesson we could all apply in business! I ordered the small size which I found ample though hungry guys could order the medium. Comes with a nice side soup, but bring your own tissues or napkin as there aren't any. Slightly chilli which I enjoyed :

Very delicious, and everything in that bowl of noodles has its charm and uniqueness; onsen egg, char siu, wanton, potato prawn, noodles, chili, soup! Located at Amoy Street food center and is very value for money (abt S$5).Tips: avoid going in late mornings and lunch hours; if you have to, expect to queue for 30mins

That place in Amoy Street Food Centre who got featured in the Bib Gourmand is seeing brisk business. I was here at 11am and there was already a long line waiting to get a taste of the japanese style noodle.Itâ€™s a hawker style food but the presentation was really good. Noodles with charshu, egg, wantons and my favourite part, the prawn fitter, especially the prawn fitter was super awesome

Next generation hawkers.I love that idea and have been seeking them out just to try their food and support local businesses. I also enjoy seeing the evolution of food in the hawker scene. Its exciting just thinking about what new novelties we'll see evolve over the next few years.A noodle story is one such evolution that has won an accolade in the Michelin guides bib gourmand list. The queue when i went at 11am in the morning was about 20 people strong and lasted till 12pm before me and my colleague finally got a bowl of ramen goodness.To say ramen is a little misleading, i'd say its more of a wanton noodle made in japanese ramen style. Maybe its a way to justify for a higher price, maybe its truly ramen. Either way, the only thing that matters, is whether it tasted good.And to this old/new blogger, it certainly did taste good. I loved this new age bowl of wanton mee/ ramen. From the sweet broth accompaniment, to the friend potato prawns, braised pork, noodles, onsen egg and wantons. I found each item to be equally well made with an attention to detail that is fantastic. The prawns were piping hot and i read they were not made in house but tasted sweet and crunchy. The braised pork melts in your mouth and the onsen egg was made perfectly. Runny in the middle and cooked just nice on the whites. The wantons, each one, was crunchy and worked well with the shallot heavy sauce and noodle. The noodle itself was perfectly cooked, springy and full throughout.My colleague felt it was good. I felt it was worth many repeat visits with friends and more friends. The only downside, the queue. Otherwise, bravo gentlemen

This place was already quite well known before it was awarded the Michelin Bib Gourmand. It made news because a) it was started by 2 young men who decided to go into the "hawker" trade and b) they decided to serve gourmet noodles in a hawker centre. The price for a small bowl of noodles is $5.90- about twice as much what you would generally pay in a hawker centre but not ungodly expensive. I decided to give it a try. There were only 5 people ahead of me in the queue but the wait was 20 minutes- ok, this sure ain't McDonald's. When I finally got my noodles, I could see the level of care put into the dish. There were 2 types of garnish, the noodles were fresh and well mixed in sauce, the slices of pork were well marinated and extremely tender, there was half a "spring" egg with oozing yolk, 2 wantons and to add crunch, a piece of prawn deep fried in potato nest. Oh yes, there was also an accompanying broth which was so full of flavor, it could have been a dish on its own. Honestly, before going, i was expecting something totally hipster and overpriced but I came away impressed instead. At $5.90, it is very good value. Well done!
