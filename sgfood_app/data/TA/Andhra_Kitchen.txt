Good food, good service. Not very spicy. Chicken fry biriyani and Apollo fish was very good. All South Indian and north Indian food varieties available. Place is spacious too. Its exactly opposite to Mustafa air travels.

Superb and authentic Andhra cuisine is served here. It is pretty economical and many times a bit crowded.

We visited at an odd hour but inspite of that the service was good and fast. We ordered a chicken biryani and andhra veg thali. The food was outstanding, just the right level of spice, that andhra food is known for. This place is hidden away. Must go try! We're definitely going again!

We ordered food for a gathering yesterday for 25 people. Biryani was ok but chicken pieces were not enough as per no of plates of biryani ordered. Aloo bonda was not fresh, potato masala inside were spoilt by the time it reach us.We ordered dal payasam, it was not dal payasam at all, it was some kind of uncooked sweet pongol. The worst desert I have eaten in my life.We called the restaurant guy, we did not receive any response back. Poor service.I recommend not to visit this restaurant

We found our best and most reasonable Indian food at this restaurant. The chicken butter masala and naan was extremely fresh and delicious. We tried to go back the next day but lost our way and ended up at another place which wasn't as good. Service was very pleasant and prompt

After a very long shopping in Mustafa Centre, a friend suggested about this place as we were craving for real spicy Andhra cuisine. The owner guided us well to the spot, it's just behind Mustafa (just adjacent to State Bank of India).Went in late afternoon after 3pm and ordered 3 vegetarian thalis for us, but what was served really surprised us as we were a little let down seeing this restaurant offered nonveg as well and veg might be of lower priority.The thali included - Naan, Flavoured Rice, White Rice, Perugu avada, Dhal, Brinjal masala curry, Palak fry, Dondakayi fry, Sambhar, Rasam, Tomato pachadi, Curd, Payasam sweet, Papad.It costed 9.5sgd for 1 thali, though a little costlier it was worth every penny as each one of us thoroughly enjoyed the andhra spice. Ambience - 3/5Staff - 3/5 Friendly and attentiveFood - 4/5 Goo

If you are non veg dont miss their Biryanis. Wholesome and awesome. There is good variety of Veg food too but you should try their Veg Andhra thali. Very different and tasty. Its a very simple joint so dont expect a hi-fi restaurant. Its right next to Mustafa Marke

1. Ambience: 1 out of 5. Or may be 0 out of 5. The aircon does not work well. The television was never switched on. It is just a room with chairs and tables. The service was not professional. The server just puts glasses,plates and food on the table. We have to arrange them properly. The restaurant looks very untidy esp.The hand wash area. This was the condition on a busy Sunday afternoon.2. Food: 2 out of 5. Very very spicy. That's all and nothing else. The only other thing that can be appreciated would be mutton dishes. The quality of the mutton and the way it was cooked is good. But again very spicy. All the dishes including the curries in thali are very spicy.3. Prices: I would definitely not give 6.50 for a mango lassi here. Given the ambience and service. But with food being so damn spicy , you will be left with no choice but to order one. With this kind of pricing, there are definitely better ones around for me.
