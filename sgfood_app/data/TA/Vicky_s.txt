This is a place for people that appreciate a really decent cup of coffee and cakes that are delicious - clearly made with passion and care.

Not the first time ordering this , but so far never fail to make everyone who tasted it happy and delightful. First tie though to come the cafe new outlet. used to frequent the older outlet more. Friendly staff who even prepared me candles and birthday tag for my son who loves the cake so much

We have been customers of Vicky's since the business started at Holland Grove Road. The Chocolate Fudge Cake is really good - dark, rich and so addictive. A close second is their Carrot Cake which is generously filled with fruit and nuts. The reason why I have not given them 5 stars is because while their service is courteous and efficient, it lacks warmth. The service staff I have met so far seem disinterested and I never feel good after leaving Vicky's with my purchase. It is for this reason alone that I have moved my business to their competitor at Greenwood

This isn't going to be a fair or balanced review. I'll be the first to admit that I'm such an adoring acolyte of Vicky's chocolate cake that I absolutely cannot be relied on to be objective or informative. Let's just say for the sake of didactic discussion that I happened to witness something unsavory happening at Vicky's, you'd never hear about it from me. I'm just that hopelessly devoted to every thing that Vicky's puts out.For those of you who remember Vicky's from Henry Park, well, it's the exact same family run operation, just back in a new location. I have to say that their timing is impeccable and with the expanded concept of a café, Vicky's Café could really ride the wave. I'm just hoping that they stick around forever like they did in Henry Park to become a neighborhood fixture. It can only be a good thing.The new retail space is nice and cozy. TJ who used to run the front of the house operations at Henry Park has taken on more responsibility as the barista at Vicky's Café here at Royalville. He pulled a very decent double espresso for me when I visited and he'd be the first to tell you that he's still working on getting it just right. They use CSH as their roasters and it comes through in the coffee. Kudos, TJ! The café has the unmistakable miasma of "hipster-ness" about it. Not really my thing, but I love it because it's Vicky's. Of course, you can do like all Vicky's long time stalwarts do and just call in, order and drop by to pick up. There are also cakes available for pickup. An 800g square of perfection will set you back $32. Let's face it, there aren't many things left in Singaporean life that'll put a smile on your face. Vicky's chocolate cake never fails to put a smile on each and every face in my family every time. It's just that consistently good. The sponge is texturally unique in that you won't find many chocolate cakes this moist that have a sponge this, for the want of a better word, zippy! If chocolate sponge could be al dente, then Vicky's certainly is. The chocolate is deceptive and its full complexity sneaks up on your unsuspecting jaded palate. There is of course the deep dark and almost earthy flavor notes you'd expect from any good chocolate, but then it blooms, developing an umami almost salty dimension reminiscent of a molé, It takes your breath away if you're not expecting it and then you have to smile at being taken for a pleasantly surprising flavor joyride. I've been told variously by different members of my family that Vicky's is good because you never get "gelak", meaning you never reach a point of diminishing returns, it's just that good that you can keep on going.Me, I'm just glad that Vicky's is back! Santa, please make them stay. I promise I'll be good
