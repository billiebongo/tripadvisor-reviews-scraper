Food is good. Crab is a pricy at $52 for a medium sized. Sauce is ok.
Hong Kong style steamed soon hock is highly recommended. Fish is done just right. Soft and succulent.
Waitress could be a little more attentive.
Overall, pleasant experience.

Best seafood place in my neighborhood. Very good selection of crab, prawn and other dishes. The price is very decent compared to seafood places in town. Good for consideration if you happen to be in this area.

Many times drove past after exercise in the park. Decided To try this time.Very nostalgic setup. Like old ponggul seafood or some Malaysia zhi char stall.Must tried- chilli.peppered crab. Satay. Muzzles surprisingly small and like la-la.No service charge or GST. will be back again after next exercise

Have been to this place many times. Food quite nice especially the salted egg crabs. Price wise is quite expensive. Environment is quite noisy but quite cooling although is outdoor without air-conditioned. Parking is convenient as there is a big car park besides it. Will go back again

I have been going to this restaurant for over twenty years and can't fault the food. I always order the garlic prawns and a jug of Tiger. On my most recent visit I took the wife for the first time she was most satisfied with the food and even ordered seconds on the black pepper chicken.It is walking distance from the Sembawang naval facilities and very popular with the locals, in recent years the food prices have climbed a little but they are still well and truly less than the more expensive venue in the city.While it is a little out of the way for most people it is close to where I stay and I will always go back for one more chilli crab and garlic prawns. To me this is a place that is a must do on any Singapore itinerary

1036 Live Seafood is actually called 1036 Eating House; cleverly named because it is at 1036 Sembawang Rd, Sembawang. If you are living or working near Sembawang, it is a favourite locals dining place and the food is really good and not expensive. They do wonderful chilli crab, which is market price, as well as a full range of various Asian dishes from Chinese, Indonesian and Malay influences. Having been there many times, I've never had a bad dish; the service is classic rush rush to get you in, fed, and out, but it's a place we always go back to

Last night went over to sebawang 1036 live seafood.. planned to have our dinner there.. parked our car at their premise and thou we go find our friends at nearby the pub area before heading for dinner then one super attitude guy came after us to told us off.. saying that it's a private area for parking.. either you eat there or you drive off.. he never hear any further explanation from us then he jump to conclusion that we are occupying that parking spaces.. we get pissed off and drive off to another seafood restaurant at the other corner to have our dinner..Damn mood spoil with his arrogant face

A group of us find ourselves "dragged" out to Sembawang from time to time, as one of us lives close by. 1036 is the venue of choice. It is friendly, informal and the food is worth making a detour.for. The decor is food court style round tables and plastic chairs, but somehow it is appropriate. We just order a bunch of dishes and a bucket of beers and off we go.In the back, there is a pool table (with an unusual beige coloured cloth) and a couple of electronic dart boards. The main trouble is remaining sober enough to drive back..
