Food is pricy but very delicious! The staff at Raffles place and Paya Lebar are friendly. Their most updated menu is at Paya Lebar branch.

Was in Nex with My mum, came across this restaurant, and gave it a try. The herbal handmade noodle was very delicious with lots of ingredients, the soup was very tasty. Elderly have special price from Mom-Fri, 2-5pm.

Went there for dinner after work.
The food was not bad but the price is more expensive as compare of food court vegetarian.
The dining experience was pleasant.
Will not consider this restaurant in coming months üëç

Love their laksa. Huge bowl, various ingredients (think too much bean sprouts), and the super smooth gravy. I basically cleaned up the bowl because of its gravy.

Being a vegetarian it is hard to find the god restaurant that is pure vegetarian.Either you have to cook at home or plan a visit to Little India or to city to have a good vegetarian food. Now we are quite relived as we have green dot at Yishun north point. Variety of vegetarian to full your stomach. We are a regular visitor and all the dishes available are quite good. Highly recommended.

The Bedok Mall outlet is now spacious. You get a table number and order at the counter. Then it's served to your table but you get the utensils, napkins and cut chilli from a side table. Several interesting choices but the best so far is the Rendang Bowl which is very large and filling at $11.90 or thereabouts. You can choose brown or sesame rice, comes with carrot and cucumber strips, king mushrooms as the rendang, curry sauce is delicious. A small bowl of old cucumber soup is provided too. Also tried the Tomyom noodles, nicely spiced with tomato, mushrooms and taupok but not as special as the Rendang set. Clean and good feel to the food but vegans might want to watch out for some noodle bowls which contain milk.Payment by Nets or cash, they don't take Visa paywave, strangely

Whilst waiting for our friend, we came across Green Dot. We especially loved their promotion which comprised of Angelica Herbal noodles at only $6.90 including a drink. Good value for money!What's more! Green Dot promotes healthy eating and especially after the Christmas season, it was good to have something light and healthy for a change. All of us had the promotion item and thoroughly enjoyed it. Will return.

Nothing really specially as compared to how it looks like. Laksa was not bad but there is a powdery taste to it. Chili was good only if i had to put a huge ladle in my bowl. Chilli was a little on the sweet side. Sitting was kinda cramp with flimsy tables

One of the best vegetarian outlet with Thai traits of smart fusion of herbs and spices close to the famed upmart Whole Earth Vegetarian Restaurant in Tanjong Pagar !Try the "Rendang" bento with salad set and the mild Laksa along with the honey water chestnut drink. The portion of its set dinner meals is sufficient for two persons, though the price is slightly on the high side.
