Ordered their charcoal chicken (salted baked), minced pork, nai bai (vege) and fish maw soup. Top up with dessert (iced jelly with lime). All very simple dishes but cooked with honesty and fresh ingredient. Must come next time to try the fish steamboat.

The meal was superb for the sliced fish steamboat. The soup was tasty and the servings were just nice. The waiters were always attentive. But it can be very crowded on weekends and may take more than an hour for seats.

I have been coming here for years but finally decided to give this restaurant a review. Surprisingly, this place is so often crowded with people even on weekdays but only 1 review so far.Don't expect ambience for romance. It's a good nostalgic coffee shop with good food. Every dish I have ordered before, you can really taste the wok heat which is essential in Chinese food. Simply delicious
