Nice and little bar...the selfie coffe or cappuccino idea is very cool..itâ€™s a bit expensive but itâ€™s nice.
Good experience .
Haji lane is amazing ðŸ˜‰

I ordered hot choco mint . I was disappointed because the chocolate tasted like instant powdered drink , it's bland and no hint of mint. I told the staff about it.

There is always something new what you can find in that world. Selfie coffee is a coffee house where they put a selfie of you on the whipped cream on top of your drink - in color.Cosy place. Delicious drinks and nice snacks as cakes, ice creams..

This hole in the wall is in a crappy neighborhood, and it was a long walk to get there, only to be turned away. There was literally no one in the shop, and the guy at the counter said it was a thirty minute wait. So we left because no one in their right mind waits 30 minutes for a take away novelty coffee just because this guy wanted to stay sitting down another half an hour. Not worth it.

Well I couldnâ€™t really fault it the cream picture on the top was so clever yes granted a little over priced but you expect that cause letâ€™s be honest thereâ€™s not very many places that offer this. Deffo a cool thing to do. They only except cash though which was a bit annoying and when you ask the nearest cash point they point you to a shopping centre which is a little while away luckily we google maps ATM and there was one across the road on beach road it was In a hotel plaza thing but was literally opposite side of the road, alternatively just take cash.

I was excited to visit and get coffee with a pic as I donâ€™t know anywhere that does this.It was quiet , I walked in didnt know what to order but felt rushed by girl, so I just got a latte . Wasnâ€™t told about anything about having photo on my drink . I received my coffee and thought ok, paid $7.50 for it and walked out.Nothing exciting for me!By the way the coffee was awe full , yuk I had a couple of mouth fulls and bin. Don know about other drinks

You simply have to go for the novelty of drinking a beverage with your photo on it! The selfie is currently only available on cold drinks. The photo comes out on a cream layer on top of your drink. Just go for the cold Latte drinks instead of the frappes, my frappe did not have a strong coffee taste, my husband had the signature cold coffee which he said was good! Haji Lane has a lot of quirky little shops to browse in, I love this area of Singapore with it's many interesting streets

I saw a youtube video on this and knew I had to go just for the uniqueness factor! I brought my husband to Haji lane under the impression that it's a funky place of town as I know he would never do something like this. Found the cafe and went in. Ordered an iced vanilla latte for $8.50 singapore dollars, she gives you their camera to take a selfie and within 6 minutes I had my drink in hand. It's a really cool neighbourhood so I recommend going to Haji lane anyway but if you find yourself there it's a great stop

Have long been wanted to visit this place and yesterday we finally make our visit there when we are touring Haji lane. They got this special machine where by they will copy your photos into your drinks with the whip cream on top. Very interesting and it cost $8.50, slightly more expensive but the drink is huge and moreover you get to see yourself in your drink. When we collected our drink, the waiter will advise you to becareful and take more photos before destroying the whip cream and only available in cold drinks. The concept is nice and we took a lot of photos with it before drinking out dark chocolate. Highly recommended to visit

Stumbled across this place in Arab Quarter, what an amazing experience! My preteen daughter thought it was the cooliest thing....and so did I! Really good quality coffee I thought and good value for the concept, well done on bringing something different to us coffee lovers! Will come again
4
Me and my friends really enjoyed this experience, however I wouldn't say that the quality of the coffee and cake were the best but I suppose this is more of a novelty!
3
Was fun to do....but the cream that the photo is on was to sickly.
I wouldn't buy food here....in the display there was mold on the food....we advised the girl serving us and she just smiled and said we know.
4
Worth the little bit of extra money. It was so cool getting myself printed on an iced chocolate!
The atmosphere is pretty casual and I only came for the novelty. Great one off place to visit.

I was a tourist being accompanied by a local and she took my over to try something crazy. The cafÃƒÂ© has a corner with various props available to prep for your picture, that had my excited. One click and we were ready to order. I wouldn't say its a big place but rather a cozy one with an upper deck. Must say, I was impressed with the image on our coffee, really made up for an interesting night. We ordered for caramel frappe and it was pretty good

Walking along Haji lane my boyfriend and I stumbled across the selfie coffee. Intrigued as to how this was even possible, we both went in and ordered a vanilla frappe.The place had a fair few customers inside, with the majority enjoying their star product: the selfie coffee. Whilst the place is called selfie coffee, you can actually have a non coffee product. Which is brilliant as my boyfriend wouldn't have been able to enjoy the drink had it been coffee as he's not a fan. So would be perfect for children as they could have a frappe or warm drink - either is on offer for the selfie drink. The vanilla frappe was good and the selfie on top was the icing on top of the cake! I don't think this place would be your regular coffee joint like Starbucks might be - but I think if you're in the area and like a novelty why not ?! A lot of fun , would recommend! The price is fair at $8.90 - but we shared a drink so between 2 people it wasn't extortionate.

The place was really small, you need to order your food and drink on the first floor, for the signature drink, ofc selfie latte/ coffee with cream, etc, but with your selfie on the top your drink, it was a cute drink, tasted good as well, but too much creme and too sweet, tbh i went to there just for experience :
2
 I would only recommend this for experience but honestly the cream on the top is way to much and too sweet. There isn't much of an experience. You get in there, there a girl behind the counter that's very grumpy, she takes your order . You ask questions because you want to know what's next . She tells you to wait upstairs. It's crowded there but you wait anyways . The coffee itself is cold coffee only , just to clarify . It's ok ! . At 17 Singapore dollars is average . Go for the experience but don't expect the quality that you might be expecting

I interested to try their recommended selfie coffee. First, we took a photograph by phone then after we got a nice picture, we ordered which drink we want ( coffee or non-coffee available). We ordered the staff's recommendation. She could not understand English well, but at least we could communicate. After we paid ( SGD 8.5) for a glass of coffee, we were asked to pick our coffee. Less than 10 minutes, our drink was ready, it looked nice. When we take a photograph of it, most of our relatives thought that the photograph was on the plastic that sealed the cup, but it wasn't. it was on the foam, so it would vanish once you drank it u

We went here for the selfie (we are easily entertained) and was pleasantly surprised that the beverage actually tasted pretty good too (we had the Signature frappe latte). And that's the only reason I'm giving a 2 instead of a 1. The girl who served us was rude and seemed to be put out by the fact that we disturbed her from her afternoon of doing nothing. I'm very forgiving of bad service, unless it comes from a place of rudeness. That I will not let go. So congratulations chick. You've just hurt your boss' TripAdvisor rating. Good job

I think you visit this cafe for the selfie experience, not the quality of the coffee, which was ok, but I wouldn't go for a second visit for.The real experience was the selfie on top of the drink, which was excellent quality and had real novelty appeal. At 17 Singapore dollars for two drinks, I found the pricing realistic and I only needed to do it once. If I had expected the coffee to be great, I would have been slightly disappointed and given 4 stars, but as I was solely interested in the selfie it gets full marks from me

The coffee was good and the cake was great. It's so worth it to have the experience and get a selfie with a selfie coffee! Love the concept :)

Went twice because of the Selfie ONLY. It's kinda interesting to have your photo on your coffee but the coffee was nothing to shout about. Service was okay though.
4
Good coffee and best part is above photo cream is the best. But one probelm is we are not allow to give photo from our ph. They have ipod and take selfie on the shop.
2
Liked the idea of the selfie (actually good photo/quality) ... but ... coffee is average at best and 8+ dollars (make that 9+ if you want soy milk) then it's simply not worth it.
1
For almost 9 $ coffee you are not even offered a glass of water. That place is just a commercial thing designed to milk the customer.
4
Buy your coffee and a selfie is taken which arrives with the photo superimposed on the top!
A quirky and novel idea if you can get over the expense, 8SPD if I remember correctly.
Great coffee.

Head to Arab Street for some good coffee, good selfies and good bars! The only place in Singapore to have graffiti so make sure your batteries are all charged up. A good place to get some textiles too.

The Service is is really POOR.....I m really disappointed!!! I went and ask for coffeee cost me 8.50 it's so expensive for an average diluted chocolate....full of ice but llittle chocolate..What's worst is she ask me with Selfie a anot....I thought with Selfie most expensive then I politely ask her if she given me the receipt she not happy show me black face say aala already given and say in a sarcastic way .This staff her name is "AMANDA" a plump lady and really has attitude problem...and after I ask her why is it 8.50 he receipt and not cheaper as I m without the Selfie...instead of explain she became inpatient to me and shouted at me how bad is that so I tell her off her attitude is bad and after I turn around to leave she still shouted bad words at me ...== worst they don't even serve me is that deliberately and I has to go to counter to ask if ready and again she rudely stare at me n say" Not yet and So what I want "??! is that how they talk to customerÂ  is this so call service this AMANDA don't even have basic courtesy for customer's and disregard others feelings this is really Poor Service I will not recommend my friends here .they don't evenÂ  greet or smile and ppl pay money for bad quality drink plus service not Worth!!

When I first read about this place in a blog, I thought I would love to see what it is all about. Well, as you go to Haji street, & all the lovely boutique shops there, of course by the time you come to the end of the street, you really need a break to sit n sip a coffee..how great it would be to have a pic of you on your coffee...love the idea <3 It was quite a wait & a bit expensive, but when you got your buzzer beep, wow, it was a real excitement. For a change, I loved my caffe moch

We ordered the selfie vanilla frappe and caramel macchiato frappe. Both tasted very good and for those that don't like very strong coffee this is a great taste for you. But the coffee is not too weak either. It was a very unique concept with our photo made out of cream.Give this place a try plus it is located on a very unique colourful street with independent fashion boutique, shop houses, middle eastern cafe's and restaurants.The seating area is up stairs it is small and simple
4
We visited here and had our selfie put on top of our cafe. Totally worth every cent.
It's located in Haji Lane which is a must place to visit in Singapore. You should totally check this cafe out.

What a fun thing to do. Not cheap though at $8.90 each.
They print your picture onto the cream. Very good quality.
Worth doing once.

As an explorer, we (my wife & I) like to look for something new. This is even becoming a habit for frequently returning visitors to Singapore like us. Selfie Coffee is an unique place to be visited. They take your picture (or you can selfie) and convert it into the top layer form of your latte. It is a TRUE WOW MOMENT when you see your picture on the coffee cup. However, for true coffee lovers, the taste of the coffee is not special. Therefore, just enjoy the experience. However, for average coffee drinker, it is good. As of other coffee cafe, they also serve foods and cakes. The place is also easy to find. Using MRT, stop at Bugis station, walk to Raffles Hospital. It is relatively near from there. Just turn on your Google map ;) So.... enjo

Yes it might sound cheesy but who doesn't like a selfie now and again? I had previously seen a Facebook video a few months ago and decided as part of our day in Singapore as our Honeymoon came to an end we would check it out. My wife had no idea but I knew she'd love this as we do like a good selfie. We eventually found the street were Selfie Coffee was located and immediately found ourselves immersed into something that didn't resemble Singapore. The street was buzzing with bakeries, tapas bars and vintage shops among others. We only had to queue about 5 minutes before we were served. You basically choose your drink from the massive menu board at the till and then are given a device to take your own selfie. We were then given a buzzer which would go off once our Iced Coffee was ready. Another 5 minute wait at our table before it went off. It was really cool, our selfie on a coffee, loved it. The iced coffee was really good too. Have a spare couple of hours in Singapore and want some fun, then check this place out!

This place is perfect for those who love taking photos. It felt so cute when I'm about to enjoy my drink with our faces on the whipped cream. It's soooo cute I want to franchise my own selfie coffee cafe! But...friendly staff could make the experience better
5
We checked it out with our 7 & 9 year old - tucked away in lovely Haji Lane - it's a bit exxcy at around S$8 a cup of cold iced coffee but fun with your faces etched in the creamy first layer. Don't worry parents, plenty of non caffeine options too (see my photo of the menu

It is not easy to locate this coffee shop and many foreigners could easily miss this joint. It is located down within the Haji Lane on Arab Street and is among the bars. A small joint, the selfie coffee is interesting concept. Once you choose your choice of drinks, you take a photo with their Iphone and within 5 mins, the colored image is on the top of the cream. It is a fun activity for families and friends. The drinks do not cost much (around SGD 9.00) and the staff are very friendly.

Recently visit thie cafe and we order a white chocolate but the taste was coffee, then the staff told us that white chocolate is like this. But i like the idea that can take selfie and it turn it into cream on top! This cafe quite relax. Is not white chocolate.
5
Was happy that the selfie photo was put on cold beverages as I didn't feel like a hot drink on such a hot day. Amazing concept. You take a selfie using their mobile. The photo is then put on to a cream layer of our chilled chocolate drink. Kids thought it was great.Highly recommend seeking this place out in Haji Lane just near Arab Stree

While Walking through one of the lanes on Arab street , we chanced upon a cafÃƒÂ¨ that said SELFIE COFFEE . We were thrilled to learn that they would print out selfie on the foam of the coffee that we ordered. Though it did take the attendant time to print our coffee but it was worth the wait. Do visit ... It's not too expensive and worth a memory!
