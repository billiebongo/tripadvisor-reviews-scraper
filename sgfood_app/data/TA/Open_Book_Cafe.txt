This is a great cafe tucked at the back of the grassroots (cao gen) bookshop. It offers coffees, teas and cakes and has doodling books on the table. The place has no wifi and encourages you to chat instead or draw something.
Worth a visit!

Quiet cafe with a Taiwanese vibe within a book store. Small selection of breads and buns. No choice for soup- it was just pumpkin the day we were there but was pretty good. No big wow factor, just quaint, quiet and contemplative.

~our colleagues were going to Sucre but it was closed on a Monday, so we went to the New Majestic Hotel's restaurant which was also closed on Monday's, while walking along the five foot way we stumbled upon the Grassroots Book Room which had a chalk board outside with some café-like pictures...~a browse thru the glass yields an impressive throve of locally authored books :)~ we walked thru the bookshop to the end which opened up to the Open Book Café :)~very small, few seater café, a mélange of furniture brings back memories of old tables & chairs I've seen folks gather and sip coffee & tea :) ~you're welcome to browse the books inside the Open Book Café and I'd taken a peek at the one about Housing & Development Board (HDB) living and it was an amazing photo story book walkthrough. As is the one about local coffee choices (you gotta see the photos)~we had good coffee & nice infused teas and a good chat about the booksNice place to learn about old & new Singapor
