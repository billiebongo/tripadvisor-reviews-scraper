The wings had a nice smoky flavor from the grilling over the charcoal fire.
Squeeze the lime over them and dip in chilli before tucking in!
Wished the chicken had a more flavorful marinate though. They cost $1.20 each.

Once or if we're lucky, twice every year we get to fly to the Food Paradise that is Singapore. This is one of our "go to" food centres when we're in Singapore.Usually the tell-tale sign of a good dish or chef is the lines out the front but I think some people just enjoy lining up for food at times in Singapore without their being any substance behind the food for my tastes.In actuality it's really hard to get a bad wing anywhere in Singapore, so I give these 5 stars for most of the places we tried. What makes this place different, is all the other good places to eat with in 10 seconds walking distance, which will give you more things to sample.It may take a little time to fine a seat at the Bedok Block 85 North complex where the food hall is situated but there is plenty to choose from whilst there and it's worth the wait. The Char Kway Teow and Oluak aka oyster omelette from the store next door are good, as is the two stalls around the corner that sit side by side to each other that serve Bak Chor Mee aka pork noodles. Just check out my other posts at Bedok Block 85 North for more information on the food available in the same complex.Cheers!Dave
