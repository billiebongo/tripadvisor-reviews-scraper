if you love eating sushis and more japanesse foods in cheaper price and not compromising the quality, you may try umishushi, the best. and what i like most is the green seaweed. its so nice and healthy to eat. try it you will eat more.

Good sushi, not extravagant but also not pricey directly withn the MRT station to grab on the way home from work. Reasonable selection, and always fresh.
