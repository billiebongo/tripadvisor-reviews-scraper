The Brizo is part of the Park Hotel, used it during the stay for breakfast. Seating is available indoor and outdoor, food is perfectly fine. In case you prefer eggs and omelettes, they are prepared outside.
3
bbq grills were well cooked but the calamari was so rubbery they could not be eaten.
service was quite good.
5
We went for a walk along Clarke Quay and ended up at this Restaurant for dinner and drinks, great food and Atmosphere.
4
Me and my friends enjoyed the free flow chilli crabs and butter cream crabs very much. The dinner buffet comes with a complimentary seafood pasta platter. Worth the price!
4
Have good variety of local food as well as American, delicious, well presented buffet bar prompt service with a smile.
4
Good place to eat, and does room service well. Try the Chicken rice -- really good and the Caesar salad with prawns was excellent as well.
4
We stayed at the Park Hotel for 4 nights and although we did not dine in, we had a good breakfast each morning. There was a wide range of food - both European and Chinese cooked dishes, as well as usual cereals, breads and pastries. The restaurant did get pretty busy at peak times
3
We ate here as my husband had previously stayed here a couple of years ago through work and enjoyed it.The restaurant was nice and clean and well decorated and pleasantly furnished.The menu has a limited choice from which we each picked mushroom soup (S$12) which was delicious,then I had Teriyaki chicken(S$17) again lovely and my husband had rack of lamb (S$38)- which was okay but a bit overpriced. My husband decided to have dessert, but from a very limited selection only 2 were available from which he chose lemon Meringue pie ($S14) which was disappointing as it was a small portion with that soft squidgy American style meringue (Had been a bought frozen dish not home made) The service was a bit slow , but server was polite .We had drinks too - bit pricey(vodka S$13 and brandy S$14.50 , beer S$19.Total bill was S$154 ,( with service charge and GST) so average for Singapore.- but wouldn't go out of my way to come here agai
4
Attentive service though there the variety of food is somewhat limited. However, if you are a crab lover, the snow crabs, black pepper crabs and chili crabs will be more than enough to satisfy your indulgence. If you apply for the Park Hotel Group membership card, there is a 50% off for 2 persons. Definitely value for money for the great food and service
4
Ordered Tom Yum soup, really delicious. The soup also came with a stick of grilled scallop, prawn and clam. For the main course, we ordered Lamb rack and Laksa. I would say the Laksa tasted really good but the lamb was just ok. Portion wise, it's suitable for sharing. Dessert we tried the chocolate cake and the selection of Cheese, not bad as well
4
Located in Park Hotel, it offers a good seafood buffet. Service and staff is efficient.Non-seafood dishes were also very good.
4
Set dinner @$20++ with bread and soup follow by main, move picks ice cream and coffee ðŸ˜‹
Oh ya, complimentary parking as well (but with expiry time ðŸ˜…).
4
friendly staff, food was average.
ambiance was nice.
best dishes were the chill crab and the tuna pie
5
Visited the restaurant for their seafood theme buffet. Not too many variety however the seafood on offer was really fresh. Loved the "lobster in the pan". Big serving. Worth the money spent
3
The spread of the buffet was quite limited. The seafood in the bag was flavourful with the garlic cream sauce.
4
Good buffet breakfast, loads of options. specially if you are sea food/non veg lover. It gives you options amongst fried, fruits, bakery, pastries , breads , beverages etc. If you are not staying in hotel then you may have to wait to be seated.Evening buffet dinner is available from Thursday to Sunday only. Other days you may enjoy Ala-carte. Various option for sea food lovers. Hardly any option for indian food
4
We were staying at the Park Hotel , Clarke Quay and this is their in house restaurant .In fact we stayed at this hotel twice and used the restaurant each visit.The seafood buffet was excellent . It is the first time that I have seen steak included in a seafood buffet !We also ate in this restaurant at lunchtime a couple of times and each time the food was very good . The Hainanese chicken rice was so good that I chose this more than once . The staff were polite and helpful especially Feng. The service was a bit slow at times hence the overall rating . Worth a try even if you are not staying in the hotel
3
Good pace to go if you are staying in the hotel but probably not worth coming in for. Good but smallish suggestion. Limp salad leaves were unforgivable. Crab, Crab legs, prawns.The lobster I was served looked like a small Moreton Bay bug but no complaints on that account. Some fish. Desserts were fine especially the fall (creme brÃ»lÃ©e
4
It was our first day at the park hotel and after two long flights we decided to eat here. After being seated we were given menus and our drinks order was taken. For our starters we had 3 squid and prawns with pomelo Thai style and the king scallops with fennel and tomato salsa. All four dishes was cooked really well and tasted great. Think the best tasting was the prawns and squid starter. For our mains we had Kurobuta pork loin with caramelised plums and a prune sauce, seafood char Kway teow which is wok fried flat rice noodles with prawns, Chinese sausages, fish cake and bean sprouts. Fried Hokkien noodles which consisted of braised yellow and rice noodles with prawns, squid , roast pork, bean sprouts and chives. Again all was cooked to perfection and tasted great. We all left satisfied. The service we received was first class
4
Other than the choice and spread of food, I had no other complaints. The staffs were wonderful, albeit slow on refill of water. Ambience was wonderful and the decoration of food spread was nice. If only the variety was better, this would be the go-to place for chill-outs and family gatherings. Do remember to do reservations ahead of time if you ever visit
3
I liked the soup and the grilled shrimp. Not to mention the amazing chili grab...Employees are courteous.
5
Good ambience for lunch meeting. Service excellent with good advice and recommendation by Christine. A knowledgeable and professional F&B staff.
Price affordable with quality. Strongly recommended if you want something worthy.
4
Good food and service !!! The crabs are very delicious! The soup tasted very good . Staffs are nice !
5
Not much options but it was good. I love there fruits. Coffee was freshly brewed and the Chef was good looking... hehehehehe
3
Selection was limited. Cheese board offerings were of ordinary cheeses. Sashimi only had salmon and tuna.
4
We enjoyed our buffet and especially the special Chinese New Year dish, introduced to us by John. All the food was beautifully presented and there is a large choice on the menu- or you can have the buffet.
4
Food choices were limited, the theme was Viva Seafood Fiesta buffet, There was no oyster or sashimi. The only 2 dishes that looked Spanish were the paella and pork knuckle. But while variety was limited, the dishes were cooked well and the service was excellent. Staff were friendly, well informed and efficient. It was an enjoyable family dinner. :)
3
First of all the waiter made a comment about me dining alone, then about the wine I ordered! I ordered lamb well done and waited forty minutes for it. When it eventually arrived it was rare so I had to send it back. They offered me a salad while I waited another thirty minutes. I was just passed hunger when it eventually arrived! A reduction on the bill was not offered
4
Prompt service and good food. Good variety of seafood (seafood buffet promotion for the month of March). Different dishes of crabs for crab lovers. Was a little disappointed that there were no oysters. However, the service was good though the place was a little cramp. Applied for the Indulgence member card so there was a 50% discount for another guest and I. Overall a great experience and will definitely visit again soon
4
Came here for the rainbow lobster lohei, didn't disappoint at all, tasted really good. Though it's not a Chinese restaurant, the server was superb in preparing and delivering the lohei for us, we really enjoyed it! Ala carte dishes were pretty decent too, attentive staff and reasonably priced
4
The selection and quality of the seafood available was very good. There was also a good variety of meats. The service was very friendly.
4
I enjoyed a great Singapore sling made at the bar and also would highly recommend their Brizo Laksa !
4
Great menu & deals, plenty to choose from. Breakfast buffet a good addition. All with prompt service.
5
I had the dinner set which was very worth the money.
The prawns and cuttlefish starter was stellar. The best prawn dish I've eaten. The service was nothing short of fantastic. To top it off there was a Beautiful ambience !
3
We were squeezed into the first sitting for the Chinese New Year seafood buffet. We walked past the restaurant half way through the second sitting and there were many tables left so not sure why we had to rush for the first sitting. We sat down and immediately told quite abruptly go and get your food now. We said we wanted a drink and in a two hour buffet sitting we thought there would be plenty of time to have a drink first. Reluctantly our order was taken. We then thought we had better go to the buffet and then we were told no we had to wait for our u Shen. ( incorrect spelling). We had no idea what they were talking about ( our ignorance I know) so by then we totally confused and went to get our starters . On arrival back at our table a beautiful plate of vegetables and smoked salmon arrived and we were told about the tradition of u Shen. ( health, wealth and happiness for Chinese New Year). It was delicious and we enjoyed that and the rest of the meal although the lobster appeared to have been hidden from us! We had breakfast there once and again suffered from lack of communication , we were shown to our seat and that was it, no explanation of any tariffs, we were not informed that the egg station was outside so we completely missed that. The whole experience was chaotic and fairly uncomfortable. Food is average and service could improve. Pity, we wanted to like it more
5
Our weekend stay included breakfast for 2, and so we found ourselves waiting to be seated on a bright Sunday morning. Nico, very polite and gracious, pointed a table out to us. Outdoor seats are also available.The breakfast spread was not substantial but suitable for a hotel of this size. Placing the live egg station outside is a good idea because of the lack of space. Service was commendable as empty plates and glasses were cleared away quickly.Good job and quite a contrast to our experience at the other hotel outlet
5
We had our Xmas day lunch here and it did not disappoint. The lunch was a buffet. The restaurant looked amazing. They had set up so many activities for children they were kept well amused and did not become disruptive which was so good. If you were taking children out for Xmas lunch this would be a good option. The complimentary activities included face painting, decorating a felt Xmas stocking , movies to watch outside and free shoes for girls if they fit you a kind of Cinderella thing and free Lego for boys. There was also carollers singing during dinner and a visit from Santa.The food was plentiful and of a high quality. The variety catered for everyone. Lots of seafood, salads, turkey, ham, lamb, red snapper and chicken. The dessert tables were great. Indulgent but the small portions for each one made it possible for you to sample lots without feeling you had too much. Standouts for me - pumpkin soup, red snapper with asparagus and panettone with custard, It was also great value for money as it was only $55 per adult plus taxes
4
I am not a seafood fan but this place is great for seafood. We went in a large group as for a dinner during a business travel and my colleagues enjoyed the food there.I was mainly sticking to vegetarian diet which may not be the best option in the place however I still enjoyed the vegetarian menu.The service was excellent and the place was crowded even on a weekday just reinforcing the fact that how popular it is in Singapore
3
~Inside Park Hotel Clarke Quay you'd find this restaurant facing the roadside~Menu has icons for recommendations, contains pork, vegetarian & spicy~Like the Local & Asian Favourite & ordered my Seafood Char Kway Teow which came slightly charred and a bit greasy (see photos)Although part of the hotel, they operate efficiently and served quickly, a bit impersonal but good for a quick & go meal :
4
The variety was not much but ample enough to keep our fills. Service is good. Attentive to our needs. Had 25% discount by mentioning ladyironchef promo. The oysters, prawns n squid are our favourite. Ended with Magnum ice cream . The salt egg crab taste good, however the crab was not that very fresh but still edible. There wasnt drinks offered but coffee n tea n ice water are good enough. Can claim free car park per bill. Overall was good. May visit again
3
So sad it's frozen crab they use , not much variety quite boring menu , lobster only one round which is one shared by 4ppl .
4
Excellent Service received from the staff, although pricing might be slightly over-rated without beverages (free-flow). Staff and friendly and however, not much variety. A little upset on the seafood portion as it isn't that fresh.
5
Bring along your families and friends to this amazing and superb restaurant. Foods and drinks are always find the good place to remember in your heart. Excellent !!!
5
This was my 1st time dining in this restaurant. It was our dinner. To be really honest, on the outside this cafe looked just normal and quite small in size but you will be pleasantly surprised by their staffs' service and buffet spread offered. The buffet looked normal but wait you taste them, you will find that they were pretty awesome stuffs. They have local delicacies like Chap Cai (Sautee Veggies), Crayfish, Chilli Crabs, Fried Dumplings, Kueh Pie Tee, Samosas, Roasted Chicken, Curry Puffs, Salted Egg Prawns with Cereals, Salad, Sushi, Cold Soba, Seafood, Fresh Mussels, Cold Prawns, Fresh Oysters, Satays (which were awesomely tender and not oily), traditional Singaporean food like Laksa etc, typical pastries like mini creamy cakes and their desserts were fabulous - Fresh Durian Pengats, Mini Cornettos, Mini Magnums, local Potongs with different flavours too. Don't they spoil their diners with such fine lovely desserts? Too bad i didn't get to eat them because I was too full, I had too much of the nice buffet food offered. Trust me you will not be disappointed when you visit them. The food served are very fresh, including the seafood. My spouse & I loved the buffet so much. We couldn't not sing praises about Brizo Cafe & Restaurant. And the staffs were so polite and highly professional. They kept refilling our drinks (tea/coffee) to ensure guests are promptly attended to & even offered us 2 special in-house fresh juices. The restaurant is a cosy and comfy dining venue to enjoy your lovely dinner for sure. Congratz Brizo for having such dedicated staffs and great food around in Singapore. Will be definitely back for more!!! Hope to see you soon

We had been staying at the hotel and noticed the special promotion "Taste of Singapura". We were pleased to have done that as the range of food, flavours especially the salted egg lobster were fantastic. This cheered me up hugely after our bad experience on the River Quay restaurant. This dining was extremely good value and good service from the staff. I wish I had another stomach to take on more

Brizo is in the Park Hotel, Clark Quay. Normally we don't like eating in hotel restaurants, because it never reflects the true nature of the country or city you are in. However we stayed at the Park Hotel and for our last evening there we decided to eat at Brizo. Well, the real reason was because it had a Taste of Singapura buffet on as part of the Singapura 50 celebrations. So it was different from their normal ala carte menu and it focused on seafood and promised a "nostalgic seafood and local dinner buffet". At only $58 per person for as much as you can eat we thought it was worth a try, especially since the promotion picture included delicacies such a as pepper crab, crayfish, fishead curry and many more. And was I pleasantly surprised! Everything was delicious and the selection was huge. Fresh oysters and many other shellfish, salted egg crayfish, black pepper crab....and dozens of other seafood types that I didn't even recognised. I don't think I ever had the opportunity before to indulge in as much crab and crayfish...and considering that we paid over a $100 for a crab a few days ago at a very questionable restaurant this was amazing value. I don't know what the restaurant's normal menu looks like, but if the quality is remotely the same as its seafood buffet promotion it is definitely a place worth considering if you visit Singapore. The particular buffet promotion is on until the end of September, so if you are visiting Singapore anytime between now and the end of September my advice is to make a booking. This is the only opportunity you will have to experience all of Singapore's iconic dishes at one sitting...and possibly the cheapest you will pay for it
4
We had the "Taste of Singapura" buffet dinner on the eve of National Day. There were quite a wide range of dishes from Chilli Crab, Cereal Tiger Prawns, Salted Egg Crayfish, satays, fresh oysters, prawns and salmon sashimi etc. All the dishes were fantastic except for the Chilli Crab which was not to our liking being too salty and crab served could be fresher. Do not be deceive by the average-looking cakes there, they were absolutely yummy! Oh, and their satays were also one of the best I had tasted!! Thumbs up!
3
4 colleagues ordered Black Cod fish from the menu but we were told that there was only 2 portions left so 2 of them had to change their orders. The wine we selected was also not in stock.Otherwise the Chicken, beef, lamb chop and Black cod quality was of good quality. The additional $12 we had to pay did not include desserts only soup, bread and salad. We were told we had to add another $2 for desserts. The information didn't seem the same when we last visited as $12 included desserts then.

Brizo Restaurant & Bar @ Park Hotel Clarke Quay has The 'Taste of Singapura' buffet brims with flavoursome seafood and scrumptious local delights to evoke national pride. Stealing the limelight in the main buffet spread are distinctive local flavours such as the Salted Egg Crayfish, aromatic Fish Head Curry made with a homemade curry paste of Indian spices, Wok-fried La-la (clam) in Bean Paste, Butter Prawns with Curry Leaves, Har Cheong Gai (Prawn Paste Chicken) and Kam Heong Sotong (Squid in Fragrant Curry Sauce). We also enjoyed the restaurantÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s signature crab dishes such as the Black Pepper Crab and Singapore-style Chilli Crab. The sweets assortment was also extensive and well above expectancy. Service was very prompt for its attention to detail in food presentation and service; the wait staff had plenty of creativity. Overall a most enjoyable dining experience. We are delighted to recommend Brizo's Seafood Buffet

I had lunch at Brizo today. It's just across UE Square building.I sat at the outdoor smoking area and ordered the Mexican Beef Burger set lunch. The portion size is huge, served with a bed of arugula and thick cut fries.The beef burger patty size was generous and done medium rare; it was juicy and incredibly delicious. It is rare to find such a satisfying burger in Singapore and I am thoroughly impressed. The lunch set comes with a drink and the price is a steal at only $12. Highly recommended.
3
It was my first yime having a crab buffet. The crab dishes here were all decent but mediocre. I enjoyed the curry crab(with prata) and durian pengat most.
3
The service of the staffs is excellent and prompt with great variety of crabs. Unfortunately the crabs are not very fresh and there is some ammonia taste on the flesh. It makes us concern if there will be any health risk after consumption.
5
There was plenty of choice and was well presented and good value for the money and good service from excellent staff tables cleared and tided as soon as they were finished with and you were greeted and taken to a table
4
The 'Thursday Buffet' offers you a variety of different dinner styles from Italian via local to fresh fish and sashimi.Combining this with a 'Singapore Sling' on top makes it a great dinner option located centrally in the Park Hotel Clarke Quai at the riverside front
3
There was a nice range of crab dishes, but the execution was mediocre. Wait staff were the highlight of the dinner, actually. They were patient, accommodating, and very nice to my aged parents and my young son.What we really didn't like was the acoustics. It was a very noisy restaurant, with conversations amplified.
3
The ambience is nice and the service attentive. The crabs is only Ok at best.The 4 types of cooked, warm crabs - pepper, butter, fragrant and chilli are very tasty but not fresh. Not bad nor stale, just not as fresh. The cold crabs were ok. The one order of Crab in the pan wasn't as good. Tasty, yes. Fresh, no. There was only 1 crab, halved for the 3 of us. The corn in that pan was bad but as we didn't bother bring it up, we are not sure what would've been done by management.The salad is very good and so are the ice cream. There's a small selection of sushi and only salmon sashimi on the weekday we visited.Nope, not returning.

We went as a group of 4 for the Crazier for Crabs Buffet. We choose this place because the review online were really good and we were searching for a new fancy place to go for celebrating things. Our normal buffet place for celebrations is â€˜The Riseâ€™ at MBS.For our experience at Brizo and especially this buffet I have to sayâ€¦never ever again.We were absolutely disappointed. The Buffet was in total 80 SGD (same price like the one at MBS) but it was less than Â¼ of the buffet spread you will find at other places (even way cheaper once). This wouldnâ€™t be a problem if the food would be really good/ quite exclusive but this wasnâ€™t the case. The sashimi selection was salmon,only. No other kind of fish. They had a few types of sushi but made max. 2-3 piece of each type so it run out super fast. The rest of the cold seafood was not amazingâ€¦ normal mussels, snails,â€¦ nothing I canâ€™t get at a cheaper seafood buffet, too (and there I can even get oysters).But okâ€¦ I mean we came for the crab but even this was disappointing. The pieces had little to no meat and there were only the basic crab variations (black pepper, chilly, butter, indian style and one special variation). The taste itself was ok but I could get this at a hawker center, too (with more meat and way cheaper).The seafood pan that was made individually for every table was good.At the end, we were hoping to enjoy some sweet finish (we saw macaroons when we entered the restaurant). But even the dessert selection (which was our last hope to save the evening) was disappointing. Half the things were finished already and nobody refilled them.I wouldnâ€™t complain about most of the things if this would have been a â€˜cheapâ€™ buffet but no, this buffet costs 68SGD ++ and it was absolutely not worth the money. Next time we will go back for the seafood night on Tuesday at MBS. It costs the same has 4 times the amount of food, everything tastes awesome and you can be sure that you will be able to finish your dinner with dessert
4
Our plan was to eat somewhere along the river. Maybe one of the restaurants would have been good but they didn't promise much. Too many Irish pubs, undifferentiated seafood restaurants and over-priced Japanese. So we ended up back at the hotel pretty late. We enjoyed the semi-buffet and 20% off drinks and were delighted. The food was well presented and promptly served and the staff first class. Being late with few other diners they had chance to talk
4
We enjoyed two delicious lunches at the Brizo - the restaurant on the ground floor of the Park Hotel Clark Quay. As a guest of the hotel we received a 20% discount which was great. It's not the most comfortable restaurant; it seems to be set up for groups rather than couples. The first time we ate there we were shown to a table right by the kitchen (to which we said "no thank you"). It was the only table set for two - but the restaurant was otherwise empty. Anyway, we were offered another table and it was fine. The quality of the food (we ate from the Asian menu on both occasions) more than made up for the seating shortcomings
3
My friends & i were all excited about their 1 Jan - 29 March Promotion - 26 different types of lip smacking highlights include Scallops, Oysters, Prawns, Sushi & Sashimi, Salted Egg Crabs, White Pepper Crabs, Golden Fragrance Crabs, Creamy Butter Crabs, Seafood Penne. Roasted Pork BELLY, Roasted Duck, and more.When we got there, there was only one variety of salted egg crab and cold crab in the cold seafood section.. It was quite disappointing, However, the other dishes were fresh and we especially like the herbal prawns & juicy roasted duck. Comparing the price from the initial promo ad on their hotel website vs what we actually ate, we wouldn't return again
3
can give you password to wifi if you ask. Reasonable food. The beer was on the expensive side, but that could be just Singapore in general
4
Decent, standard breakfast fare, Quick, polite and efficient service as well. Omelette station chef, thin dude, can be quite grumpy in the mornings but he does make a pretty nice omelette. The fruit selections are very fresh and lovely when paired with the blueberry yoghurt.
5
Clean, pleasant, excellent service and delicious food, a choice of either a buffet menu or a la carte. What more can I say??
5
The buffet is just the right lay out and taste good, service is great and professional. The restaurant setting is clean and with great views.
4
Great decor and cool atmosphere. Happy hour till 8pm. Great pizza and salmon. A good place to start a nice evening before heading out elsewhere
4
large choice of breakfast items to suit all tastes, from juice, yoghurt, bacon, fruit, breads, and an egg station for omelettes or fried eggs.
4
A very good choice of starters with lovely fruit and mains of hot limited english breakfast and oriental.
5
Nice food and good ambiance at restaurant and bar......One love its food......a quality good food is available according to your choice....
3
I enjoy good foods even only small portion, disliked large quantity of "foods with no taste".Prepare the food in special and artistic ways, I enjoy the taste, not just a quantity to fill up my tummy.I do enjoy variety of fresh sea and shell foods, fruits, meats and veggies, all types of culinary preparations.
5
We arrived and was seated. The waiter helped us and explained all the traditions such as the round plate of vegetables we needed to mix with sauce and honey lift it high for good luck. The service was perfect, atmosphere lovely and the food was out of the world. Really one of the best meals I had in 56 year
4
Great service . Good choice at the buffet breakfasts. Excellent a la carte dinner in the evening. If you are on a Singapore Airlines Stopover Holiday package the meals are excellent value.
5
Ate breakfast here every day was great service extremely clean and the food selection was great. The staff were very attentive.
4
great buffet breakfasts. 50% discount if you get singapore airlines stopover............................................
5
A beautifully presented 3 course meal on our last day at the hotel, with The Best NZ Lamb !! Perfectly cooked
4
My husband is steak mad and everywhere we go he has to eat steaks! Here we found fillet steak coked beautifully at a very reasonably priced. Thank you
3
Breakfast buffet is good. Service needs improvement though. On our second night in the hotel (Park Hotel Clarke Quay) , we had a drink or two and just talked the night away with some friends. The waitress was not friendly and accommodating and was clearing our table, wanting to " shoo" us away. We would have wanted to stay longer, but obviously she did not want us to linger around. So we ended the night earlier than planned and went to another place nearby
5
The ambience is ideal for meet up and discussion. We were greeted with warn hospitality by your shift in charge Christine and Nick who promptly see to our needs. They provide professional services which we don't find in other restaurants. We took their recommendations which we think they have carefully considered in terms of our needs and cost
5
Our party of 4 adults and 3 kids had the weekend seafood buffet dinner. Service was very prompt and the wait staff had plenty of initiative. Plates were quickly cleared and water refilled with no prompting needed, unlike so many other buffet restaurants. Food served were of a high quality although the spread wasn't huge. Again replenishment came fast without any prompting.Overall a most pleasant dining experience
5
Attended the Friday evening Seafood Buffet. Can highly recommend the Park Hotel for its attention to detail in food presentation and service. The quality of food was first class and the range across the board beyond expectations. Kicking off with Tiger Prawns and Oysters was a delight. Settling into Butter and Chilli Crabs was a signature time of the evening as the taste and quality were superlative. Whilst Seafood was the hook to draw people in plenty of other opportunities including roast Duck abounded. The sweets array was also extensive and well above expectation. We are pleased to recommend Brizo's Seafood Buffet and place the offerings on a high bench along with many fine establishments in Singapore.
5
Luckily we booked awhile before departure as was completely booked out ahead of time. Great array of different dishes from different countries; excellent service with nothing too much bother for any of the staff. Carols and Father Christmas added to an excellent evening at a really great restaurant
