Had lunch on the first day of work with family. It was a good start for the year. Food was good with reasonable price.

Feb. 6 to Feb 10th 2017 Fusion Spoon catered Breakfast, Morning Tea, Lunch, and Afternoon Tea for an International Scientific Conference. They did a good job. Attached are a sampling of the variety of their spread.

Had a lunch here during autumn break, so there were almsot no people. Fast and efficient service, good asian food - nothing particularly awesome, but we had nice time. God prices.

This is an OK place, but there is a lot better food in the hawker stalls nearby. The Indian stall in Hall 9 and the Chi eye stalls in Cantine 2 are great.

This is a great new alternative at NTU. Great sandwiches and soups that you can buy in combos. Very helpful and friendly staff.

We stumbled on the restaurant while visiting the Botanic Gardens. At first site it has all the appearances of a fast food joint and to some extent it is - except that the food is of very good quality and very favourably priced.The fun part is that you order and pay via a touch-sensitive screen and the food is announced when it is ready to collect.There is also a linked stall selling waffles and Korean ice cream - delicious!We had lunch here twice during our stay and were not disappointed both in terms of taste and price

Thought we would just have whatever lunch was available and walked right into Fusion Spoon. Ordered the Japanese sets and were really surprised by the ease, choice and fair quality of the food and excellent service. The traditional coffee choice did not disappoint. The price was surprisingly Low for a tourist spot. And a playground for my next family visit? A bit too much to hope for. But it’s there. Keep the good stuff going please. The menu is really quite Long. .... The usually choosy Mrs didn’t complain except the rice used wasn’t Japanese. But then the price was far from Japanese too... looking forward to my next visit. Really don’t want to share this one with you.

The food is OK and the service as well. Unfortunately they do not always have all meals displayed on the menu. Pricing is reasonable as well. If you just want to eat something it is a decent place. With the ratio quality vs pricing it is a good to very good choic

Had dinner and breakfast here. The service was very good and efficient, and the prices are very reasonable. The food is average- it's a mix of standard Asian and western cuisine. It's a good, efficient place for meals if you are doing business at NTU, but I would probably go to the hawker stalls nearby instead if you are feeling more adventurous

We had three breakfasts and two lunches at this restaurant, and we were very much satisfied. The spread in the menu for buffet breakfast is quite wide, with excellent choices for vegetarians too. For a vegetarian lunch, we recommend their Veg. Fried Rice and Veg. Lasagna. The portions may be a bit small (especially for fried rice) but the food is quite filling
