Thanks to Roni and his staff. The Super Bowl Party was outstanding. We were treated like royalty!! McGettigan's CQ is a must visit.
4
My wife and I enjoyed a “Smokey Hog” BBQ pork sandwich and a Caesar Salad. The staff were friendly and helpful.
5
Popped down for a feed and drink. Its a great spot for that. Extensive menus and friendly staff. They have done this place well. The Guinness is poured well :)
4
Music and atmosphere was really good. Staff were friendly and helpful in recommendations. Alcohol drinks, albeit nice-tasting, were generally pretty mild though; good for those who are not good at drinking.
1
We were there on a ladies night and were told 4 free drinks for ladies and $10 happy hour drinks for men. They then charge you full price for everything and try to bs their way. Told us that we ordered premium drinks despite 2 or 3 times we commented on our drinks being free/cheap with no correction on our assumption. Normal screw the tourist crap. Get 1 star as the food was good. Beware
5
Me and my mum visited twice during our short stay in Singapore. We were enticed by the pleasant setting, live music and friendly atmosphere. Each and every staff member was attentive and personable. They were accomodating to my request for a change in my dish which was delightful. The food was divine, we tried several dishes and hands down some of my favourite food I've had. You can tell it is all freshly prepared and exquisitely presented. The drinks are also amazing, not the cheapest but definitely worth the money as you're paying for an experience too. I would like to say a special thanks to Vishnu and Kapil who made our two visits special. Their service on the first night (alongside food quality) brought us running back the next day! :)

Clarke Quay is one of the best places to hang out in when in Singapore on an evening. The choice of cuisine is truly global looking for some home comfort food I settled on McGettigans. I am not usually a fan of Irish bars but this one is a comfortable exception, sat outside to watch the crowds milling past. Food was delicious chicken stuffed with goats cheese on mustard mash. However the place looses points on the service which was quite slow, having to wait almost 30 minutes to pay my bill
4
Great corner location as you enter the quay so sit outside with a cold beer and watch the world go by. Also has tvs outside and nice seating area if you don't want to sit inside.We didn't eat but menu looked good, as elsewhere in the city drinks are expensive so aim for happy hour between 6-8 (I think?) to save a few dollars
5
A colleague & i came for a business lunch on a Thursday, we enjoyed it so much we came back on the Friday also. McGettigan's is without doubt the cleanest bar in Clarke Quay, beer is cold, food is great & service is excellent, also has a number of TV's showing a range of different sports. Special commendations to, manager Roni and barmaid Ting for making experience awesome
4
We came here on our first night after hearing some good live music coming from the bar. Our waiter, Vishnu was really helpful and recommended the steak burger which was really tasty. Good atmosphere, good music, good pints and good food and very friendly and chatty staff. No complaints.
3
The place is well situated. And it is confortable enough. Prices are not cheap but the usual pub grub is more than OK and the draft beer is perfectly served. Service is pleasant and efficient enough. I actually enjoyed the experience.
5
Very good well excellent in fact, good old fashion English food together with live English music what more could we ask for on a late Sunday afternoon
Keep up the good work Vishnu
3
Situated on the banks of the river, McGettigan's is a nice place to enjoy a drink of Guiness and some crack.
3
I was there for UFC218.Needless to say, it's Sunday breakfast time.And breakfast was good. Nothing special. But good.Felt like the staff didn't want to be there and ordering food and drinks felt like asking for a favor. Which I was, in a sense.The menu was reduced so not many options.A Club Sandwich style chicken thing...it was good.Chicken wings...if you can't get chicken wings right, you better off venturing into another business.And breakfast. Honest, but just ok

We arrived late into Singapore and we were exhausted and hungry, I looked for our nearest Irish bar and this popped up, saying that they serve food until midnight on their website so we went. We arrived at about 9:30pm and ordered some drinks first (a glass of house white and a beer) and sat outside, after finishing our drinks I went to order more and ask about food as there were no menu's on the table. My partner gave me the exact money for our drinks as I was ordering the same again and had no had a chance to change any money. I was served by a different member of the team who said that this round was $5 more expensive than the last so I trotted back to the other half to ask for more money, went back and paid to be told that he was wrong and it was only $2 more than the last round ... However it was the exact same drinks so I don't understand why the price had changed after 30 minutes. That aside, as I was too tired and hungry to argue I then asked about food to be told the kitchen had closed. Please do not advertise that you serve food until midnight if you don't, there are lots of places where we could have gone and found drinks at a reasonable price and that were service food. There was also no Irish theme to the bar which I could see and needless to say that we did not return and found other places while we were in Singapore
5
Having not had a lot of choice for lunch in Clarke Quay we were happy we found this place and had a couple of Caesar Salads. The staff serving us was very good looking and helpful with the free WIFI and it was a welcome break from the heat.
5
The service was fast, servers bartenders and management were fantastic, food and drinks were delicious!Ron Sashi and Vishnu (not sure if I spelled his name right lol) are the best!They catered to me and my girlfriends every need! We stopped by a few times, when we were in the Clarke Quay area and not out and about exploring Singapore! When it did get busy they were still absolutely professional and able to provide the same awesome level of assistance to other guests and patrons as they did to us two!Definitely recommend this to everyone!
4
The decor in the restaurant cum bar has a strong Irish bar character. If you would like to come for lunch, please arrive at 12:15-12.30 PM as the kitchen does not start until 12:15 PM Service staff were prompt, courteous and quite accommodating to your request. We were there for lunch and ordered a bucket of Beer. However few bottles were unopen and they let us bring back.The food was really scrumptious. We had a blast over the meal.We ordered Pulled Pork Burger, the BBQ dressing in the meat was a punch. Pulled pork was tender.Fish and chips was great, it could be better if it did not use frozen fish.Loved the Nachos too, generous beef and cheesy nachos kept the party happy.Bangers and Mash was a favorite too, they had good sausages in generous portion.Truffle Mac and Cheese could be better though, the truffle aroma was too faint. However the macaroni was creamy. If you do not really like strong milky aroma like me, I do not recommend this.Overall, we had an enjoyable meal in the restaurant. During lunch time, the place was not too crowded. Just nice if you look for a relaxing bar
4
We had a group of 12 that wasn't booked ahead and the staff catered really well for us. A large table at the rear was immediately reserved and the service was great. Food was good and the drinks were average prices. My only gripe is the lack of Gluten Free food options (although I found this in the majority of restaurants in Singapore). We had two coeliacs in our group and the only option was the $35 steak which was lovely but had limited sides due to the GF restrictions. A very small meal for the price compared to the other meals ordered in the group. An Irish pub with no GF potato options! Most of the group were able to order a $20 burger and fries which included a beer! The bathroom was really clean and the service great. An excellent location right on Clarkes Quay. I'd recommend except for the gluten free issue
3
Came here when nobody was here, and although the food and beer were good the service could use a little more organization, stupid slow service
5
This place has such a great atmosphere and incredible service from the staff here! I will be back for happy hour and live music!
5
Popped in for a quick meal and very glad I did, my wife and I had the chicken Caesar salad with french fries. Portion size very large but more importantly food was good. A salad is not a culinary masterpiece but I have a few poor salads in restaurants before. This was one of the best with good quality bacon and chicken. Attentive and professional staff always welcome. Good and simple food
5
My partner and I came here for an afternoon refreshment. Roni suggested a Singapore sling cocktail which was delicious and well prepared. Good vibes and atmosphere, which is helped by the charm and attentive service we received from Roni. Will be back to try the dinner menu, thanks
3
Arrived to watch the Australian A League (which was advertised as being shown, along with Wallabies v All Blacks). Staff seemed bewildered and eventually came back to say "no sorry". So we took ourselves of to Boomerang (see my seperate review).Screens are poor quality (or the feed is?)Guinness is great. As is live music
5
Super cool bar, awesome atmosphere, rad people great selection of Irish beers and scotch. Ronnie the bartender is the ma
5
Great atmosphere, awesome staff, and great food. I love this bar and will be coming back no doubt. Ronnie is the man
5
Great location, good food and happy hour prices. Thanks to Vishnu for the excellent service and friendly conversation
5
My entire family loves this place. Spent a week in Singapore and this was our favourite eatery to keep the whole family happy. The dinners were excellent, service very efficient and the whole "Irish Pub" feel was great. In comparison to other eateries on the Quay - and we frequented many, this is the best value for money with a comfortable vibe. Even on their busiest nights, it was still preferable to other restaurants around the corner. Will most definitely be returning. Thank you Roni for your hospitality and great service
1
I would challenge any person to try the so-called 'Irish Breakfast'. Revolting doesn't even come close. They couldn't even get the toast right- as in: the soggy bread wasn't toasted. The tea never arrived. Two miserable looking eggs. A couple of manky bratwurst-like sausages. Rancid little strips of bacon that appear to have come from the back of a Singapore river rat. A cold little cup of beans and a few morsels of what I can only guess were supposed to be mushrooms. No pudding of any kind despite the menu's bold claims. Absolute rot. Best of all: $33 for this slop. I would rather saw my own leg off with one of the butter knives on the table (kudos to the staff-we got cutlery) than even have to be in the same room as this disgraceful dish again.
4
Food was average, beer on tap was good. Server a bit blur but was better at the end. Ambience was nice.
4
We felt very welcome by friendly staff. The food is great! We love the band playing on every Thursday night.
4
My friends and I had a fabulous time dancing to the hits played by the Jukeleles. We're also pleased with the standard of service. The cherry on top is that they screen rugby games :)
4
We had dinner here on our first night and it was terrific, the chicken and salmon dishes were delicious and well priced . Came back the next night and had a minor issue with one meal but the response from our waitress Iva and manager Ronnie was a credit to their customer service. Loved the live music too. We will be back
2
Wasn't impressed by the food. Steak was tough, organic chicken was dry, Wagyu burger overdone and bangers were hard. Prices weren't cheap too. Guy that served us looked tired. Wouldn't go back there again
5
It was our last day in Singapore and we went over to Clarke Quay for dinner. This restaurant was a breath of fresh air amongst all the chinese, indian, and thai restaurants. We both orderef ribeye steaks and they were divine. Cooked to perfection according to our liking. Desserts were also delcious. Happy ambience and helpful staff. Definitely reccommend this place
5
We stopped by for lunch after checking into our hotel. The staff were helpful and pleasant. The food was pretty decent pub variety, we ordered the club sandwich and the organic chicken. There was a kids menu with pretty decent servings. Overall recommended when in Clarke qua
5
We had a wonderful early dinner at McGettigans. The food was delicious (I had the organic chicken and my husband had a full breakfast). The staff made it very special. Rani was so friendly and made a real effort with us and are kids! Def recommend this place!
3
Needed a venue to watch the first British Lions test and was on the doorstep of our hotel at Clarke Quay. Being resident in Dubai was interested to see how singapore's equivalent matched up. Ordered food that didn't go down well in form of the platter. Beer went down well but rugby result didn't. Hope the platter was a one off disappointmen
2
We went out of the way to try it, but the information provided by the helpful but clueless staff on their menu and promotions was wrong. Resulting in us nearly overpaying double the price. Would not recommend.
5
I was just out here exploring and bar hopping and I saw this place. I'm glad I walked in, because it turned out to be pretty fun! Lots of other travelers as well. There are plenty of other bars around as well, so the location is awesome. The bartender was cool as well! As a rugby player, I was glad to see them showing some rugby on the TVs. Turns out the bartender was a rugger as well, and offered to go look for a jersey/shirt for me. Just didn't have them in my size (I'm a big dude lol). The service and atmosphere are great, and it's a definite must, especially if you're bar hopping
5
Stopped for a quick drink after lunch; was served by the lovely Paige. Great service with a smile rarely seen in Singapore.
5
Had a fantastic night here, the staff were fantastic particularly Ronnie he made our night. Great drinks and great views of the river.
4
Nice lrish theamed pub, awesome attentive service, good atmosphere. Had bar snacks while watching the rugby, highly recommend the pork belly popcorn and satay mix.
5
The people at McGettigans are really unique and their greatest asset. There are hardly any restaurants or bars in Singapore where the staff seems interested in their guests. They're mainly taking orders and bringing food. Very different here. The staff seem happy and cheerful and keen on getting a conversation going. I also like to sit outside where you can enjoy the sunset, or sometimes inside where you'll get the original pub smell which just let's you must have a beer or more. The food is also outstanding, I love their burger Monday's where you get two for one.
5
I can honestly say Roni and the team at McGettigan's CQhave customer service down pat. Not just another clique but the real thing. The service was done with a smile and the team genuinely smiled. Obviously Roni has picked a team who want to do there job because they are people focused. Oh yeah the steak was tender and cooked to perfection and the beer was cold. My second experience with McGettigan's. Jakarta also had great atmosphere and staff. Definetely the beginning of a long love affair. Thanks team
5
All blacks were playing the Lions and we wanted somewhere fun with a great atmosphere to watch. We weren't disappointed, the hospitality Lynn and Roni provided here was truly fantastic. Reserving us the best seats to watch the game, we had a ball.Thoroughly recommend this spot if you want a great time!
5
We go to McGettigan's for their drinks specials and to see the fabulous Dita perform! If you like listening to a talented singer cover popular songs from the last few decades, definitely swing by on a Wednesday night to see her. To go along with the great performance, they have 1-for-1 cocktails on Wednesdays and Ladies Night on Thursdays. Make sure you ask for the drink coupons, they aren't the most forthcoming about it. 5 free drinks (spirits/prosecco) for the ladies
4
This is a nice place to come for happy hour drinks or food. The wait staff are super friendly. Happy Hour prices are good. Their fat chips are big and yummy! You have views of the river. There is live music. Seating is either inside or out, where you can people watch
3
Situated in Clarke Quay this bar however does not really stand out in any way. Food is ok nothing special. And to be honest bar service is a bit slow. There are better.
5
The sign above the door says it all. If you add to that the friendly and efficient staff, particularly Roni and Roslyn, along with the best GUINESS on tap that I have had for quite a while, your visit to Clarke Quay will not be a disappoint. Well done to you both you certainly made a stay in Singapore a treasured memory
5
Being big AFL fans we needed to find somewhere to watch our team live from Singapore. We googled and found a few spots but when we turned up the bars were either closed or not showing the game. A local suggested we try McGettigan's. When we arrived we were met by a smiling barman named Roni, we chatted about whether they could show the game and he said to give him a minute and he'll see if it's possible. Roni was back in a few minutes and advised it was being televised but someone was watching the premier league so he needed to check a few more options. In a matter of 5 mins we were propped up at the bar in front of our own big screen watching the game. Roni and his colleague Ashaka(sorry if I've misspelled your name) looked after us all night serving quality drinks and providing great conversation. Our team won and we had a great night meeting friendly staff and other AFL fans. If you love your sport or just want a sensational bar with great value drinks and awesome atmosphere then get down to McGettigans and say hello to Roni and his colleagues.Rick & JulesAustralia

Had been here before and had a good experience but this time the staff let them down, not interested and looked bored. Got a drink quick enough although when i asked what the house wine was and liked it brought a different wine because he had got it wrong and it wasn't one i would have chosen. There were two of us and we had one menu! It wasnt busy had to ask for another one which was brought with a shrug! Sat for a long time before waiter came over and asked if we wanted anything, by this time we had decided to go elsewhere and i'm glad we did , see my review on the other place what a contrast. Your staff seemed to be always rushing going somewhere but not serving the few customers that were there! Sorry guys for me you messed u
5
A great atmosphere to watch sport, listen to the bad, dance and celebrate wedding anniversary. Ronnie our indian irish host made us feel immediately welcome and got the band to play happy birthday followed by Dancing Queen for us !Recommended the food and ensured we maximised the happy hour prices by drinking more until 11pm 
5
Was in Singapore on business trip on 24th April 2017and found details of the bar on Celticbars.net - great pub and really good food. Guinness very good also! Staff were very friendly and accomodating. Special thanks to the manager Fergus for putting the previous days match on - had watched it in The Dublin Gate, Saigon and was great to see again! Will visit again next time in Sing
1
One pint of Guinness - S$18.24 - sitting at bar, no special service. Way overpriced! Avoid this place
1
I was recently in Singapore on a business trip and came to your bar as I have been to the one in Dublin . Myself and my work colleague waited over 20 minutes for a drink and were served by this rude girl whom I think her name was Paige . She seemed more interested in talking to the younger guys than serving other customers . Not a great service when it's warm outside and all you want is a cold beer . Will not be back and hope you look into finding other staff who seem to focus better on their customer service skills .
5
Really good pint(s) of Guinness! All staff members really friendly and happy hour(s) every night. Two pints for the price of one.I enjoyed a great salad and returned on two occasions. The manager "Ronni" was very helpful and accommodating. Great inside and outside seating with plenty of TV screens for sport (especially when Liverpool play!)I would recommend this establishment to any visitor to Singapore
2
We popped into McGettigan's to shelter from the rain. Having waiting for a while we were able to order a beer. At this time of the day most places offer a reduced price as part of the happy hour's to pull in trade. Not at this place. The beer, service and attitude of the waitress was poor. Having paid over £10 GBP for this we were also short changed. Mistakes happen but I got the feeling we were not wanted and so I will make McGettigan's happy and not return.
3
A pint of beer and a Diet Coke came to $23 or £16 includes a service charge and local taxes, best to ask first before ordering, just some advice, decor ok, service good, price poor
5
Called in here on our first night while staying in Singapore for 3 nights on a layover. We ended up calling in 3 nights. Excellent Service! as soon as we walked in the door we were served by the manager Fergal...Lovely guy The waiter who served us was absolutely fantastic. He was so attentive and made us feel like VIP's in an Irish bar. The food was brilliant, Oxtail stew was beautiful, My wife had a chicken wrap....sounds simple but it was beautiful. Would definitely recommend McGettigans to anyone in the Clarke Quay area or even if you're not, make an effort to get there. It's worth it. Thank you Fergal and team...we will be back :
5
Myself and my family came here a week or so ago and had a very nice meal. What was better was the service - Ronnie did a tremendous job of looking after us and keeping the children entertained with his art work (not sure about the portrait of me !).Thanks to all for the outstanding service and very nice meal
2
I give it two for how it looks which is great. Unfortunately you can only judge by personal experience and mine was badDrink was warm and service was just rude. It was like they see trying to look cool like a stroppy teenager does!!!Menu was not very good either but I would have stayed to eat if the service was betterMay retur
3
Visited McGettigan's @ CQ for a quite evening with friends at Malt Room, disappointed to know that it's open for private events only. Live band, was acceptable mostly, but a bit too loud at times.Food was good, Single Malt options in bar menu, very limited
5
I was in Mcgettigan's Dubai last wed with All the jocks and had a great Night thanks Eugene. But have to say the Mcgettigan's In singapore is prob the best one Iv been in. Top shout out to the manager Ronnie. Thanks a million for getting the cheltenham races on for me and serving us as if we where in dublin. God Bless Happy St Patricks Day Mr Kilkenny !!! Well done Ronnie friends returning St Patricks day hope you all have a blast 
4
Targeted this bar so we could watch a England Six Nations game whilst on vacation in Singapore. Located in the vibrant bar/restaurant area of Clarkes Quay, this bar offered excellent drink options, helpful staff, with multi screens and good sound system which allowed us to enjoy the game in a excellent air conditioned environment with a great vibe.Would have also liked to visit when the band were playing, but our itinerary didn't allow, highly recommended
1
As a regular Mcgettigan's customer in Dubai, this one was very disappointing. The full-irish breakfast was average, they had no coffee or do not do poached eggs. More importantly it took 45mn to get the food and service was very mediocre.. wouldn't go back there in Singapor
2
Very good dinning environment. However, the service is poor. The waiters will tend to forget about the orders. Reminded 3 different waiters of the order. In the end, we had to walk to the bar and order and collect the drink ourselves. The moment we finished our drinks, a waiter hurried us to leave. He even asked the newly arrived customers to stand at our table to wait for us to leave!!! This has left a very bad experience on the service
4
Looking for a drink and some fun in SG, we stumbled upon McGettigans pub, the cocktails were sublime and the atmosphere was great, we had a good time at the bar and soaked up the atmosphere to the early morning. Recommend to anyone wanting a good time
5
We came to McGettgan's for a quick dinner with the kids and our order was misplaced. The manager managed it really well. Corrected the issue very fast with professionalism. Then once served gave us the meal on the house. Very well done, great service. Burgers are one of the best in town. Excellent food.
4
When you have been walking around in Singapore and really need to rest, taking a drink and some food in McGettigan's fits the bill. We sat outside and people watched, and relaxed. We expected to stay for half an hour but lasted much longer than that due to good food drinks and service
5
Friendly and warm service, found the food, especially a Sunday special beef plate and salmon were both tasty and had very nice presentation
5
Watched the Australian Open live with Irish commentary, was such a great night we came back a few nights later. Awesome service - the barmen really 'get' good service & are great to chat to. Ask for Ronnie.
5
Had the Wagyu steak burger and was absolutely lovely, really enjoyed the food and the Guinness! The staff are really helpful too😀
4
Great Atmosphere, Drinks, live music, bar food really good, the one exception: the humus - very big on colours, not much flavour.Bar staff very helpful and friendly
5
We were staying at the nearby Park Hotel on Clarke Quay for four nights and, despite our usual determination to vary our evening venues, found ourselves returning to McGettigan's time and time again, probably due to the tasty Erdinger beer!During our visit in late November/early December there were plenty of office Xmas parties and many tables on the pavement were reserved, but seeing our disappointment and perhaps recognising us from previous evenings, the staff always managed to squeeze us in.The pub was super-friendly and during Happy Hour extremely reasonable for Singapore. Highly recommended
5
We're only in Singapore for a short time , unfortunately, but have already been in McGettigans several times. Each time our visit has been most enjoyable. It's very comfortable and has a fine range of beers, wines & spirits, plus excellent food, either for light bites, or more substantial mains. Service is top notch and is excellent value for money, especially compared to so many other establishments in the area. The place is managed so well by Ronnie, who is genuinely welcoming, friendly & helpful. It all adds up to my full recommendation for McGettigans as a great place to visit, at any time
3
Realised there's been a change in menu and i prefer the old menu. Service was good, restaurant is comfortable
5
Just done a week in Koh Samui so fancied something non Thai/Chinese.Stopped here for a couple of pints and enjoyed the music and atmosphere so ordered an 8 oz burger each along with a bottle of red.Excellent succulent burger that was really tasty.Great food, great wine, great company and great waiter named Ronnie.10/1
5
Did the Irish thing and went to seek out an old familiar Irish bar to relax with some live music and food. I got more than I was expecting when I ordered the Steak burger. One word " Amazing" . Almost too big to eat and cooked to perfection. Irish style .I was tired of Asian food and this was my Oasis. Fantastic staff and fun too. Band was blasting U2 . Great evening had. Ill be back
1
On our last night in Singapore and after a long walk we stopped at Mcgettingans in Clark Quay for two McGettigan burgers. The place was very quiet on a Tuesday. Then we waited and waited and after 40 minutes the food finally arrived, we by then we're really ready for it. Most sadly first bite of my burger it was stone cold. In the food business myself for over six years, I know how occasionally it can go wrong, but on a quiet night with few in, it was inexcusable in our view. Sadly reading some of the other reviews, this is by no means the first time. A reputation is everything and I really think Mr McGettigan needs to take a long hard look at the systems at this place. That all said, the staff were genuinely very apologetic and understanding, but it just should not happen; it lets the brand down big-style and Dublin would not be too pleased
4
When thousands of miles away from home, it's good to find something that reminds you of home - especially when just arrived off a long-haul flight for a holiday. McGettigan's is pretty much what I would expect. I didn't drink beer as I was getting over jet lag, but there was a good range of beers available, including Guinness of course. We went twice and the food was very good on both occasions. It seemed a blend of traditional Irish/British food with some local ideas, e.g. lemongrass on top of a salmon fillet. Some dishes were really Irish, others just as likely to be found in Britain - but there is a big overlap in cuisine. Some people in their reviews have questioned the cleanliness. You need to remember the humidity in Singapore. There was an insect problem on one night, but the staff dealt very swiftly to sweep the insect away with a bucket. That's all we can ask for. A couple of thoughts: 1) listing prices without tax isn't very helpful for Irish and UK visitors, 2) inside is non-smoking and outside smoking, but the door isn't closed so segregation is poor and 3) you have some gender-specific offers - do you really think this is acceptable since people cannot choose their gender and should be treated equally regardless of it surely - and there are only offers for one gender. Surely this is as sexist as it would be racist to have white persons offers, yet some institutions in some countries still offer gender specific offers, but of course never for race. In UK, it's banned now, and very rarely happens
5
We've been in Irish pubs around the world - and they're not all great. However - this one is, and mixes the traditional with the more modern, including a Bushmills-based cocktail. Roni (the Indian manager, who has spent long enough working in Dublin to have great craic and a passable Irish accent) was great fun, and our genius barman Sashi had great cocktail recommendations, including a jajapeno drink. Warm and welcoming pub, well worth a visit
4
I would give a 5 stars if not for the lousy food. Good ambience, good live band but unfortunately food standard seems to have dropped on the new year eve day. Wonder if the usual chef is on leave. Food was either bland or hard.
5
Even though it's our first visit, Waiter Tanesh recommend us with a special drink "Around The World" which my girlfriend was absolutely satisfy. Wonderful experience
5
Went to a private event and the bar was run by 2 guys only, Jidi and Joseph. And they were fantastic! Even though it was chaotic, they managed to served everyone without making us wait very long. And they served with a smile too, trying to accommodate to everyone's request. If you were to visit Mcgettican's and they're in the bar, you're in for a smooth night with no mess.
5
I was attending an event at this bar which has a private function room above it. It was my first day out of hospital having broken my leg and I was still in a wheelchair. I arrived early so that I could take dinner with friends that evening. I rested in the bar for a while before the function began at 11 o'clock, and ate dinner. The staff were very accommodating and arranged the furniture so my wheelchair fitted in. Ordered fish and chips for dinner which was excellent - that said, it could easily have fed two people. Good selection of drinks including exclusive cocktails and good beer. Staff arranged for me to use the service elevator to the upper level to get to the function room. Extremely helpful and the function room was very comfortable. Free wife, good air conditioning, great service and tasty food - in short good all round. Will be back soon.
5
The food at this place was amazing and the staff was really nice and helpful. This is the place for clarke Quay to start with a beer. Tanesh was a good waiter and friendly.
5
My family and I ate at this restaurant last night. It had a nice atmosphere with live singers.The food was surprisingly delicious for an Irish Pub. We took advantage of the 2 for 1 burger special. What makes this restaurant stand above others in Singapore is the great service by Ronnie. He has such a charming personality and goes the extra mile to give great service. If your in the quay area, stop by this place
4
We were here last week to enjoy the Ladies night with friends. We had a great time with the Live performances and great service. Friendly staff especially to Jidi! We will definitely recommend this place.
5
Had a fantastic meal that was extremely tasty and cooked to perfection. The service was also fantastic, with great jokes and banter from Ronnie. The best Irish Red label scotch I have had......hey Ronnie.....Ian 
5
Had lunch with friends and the food was great. Lots of food with big servings. Great place if you had sports to watch. Great atmosphere. The service was great as well.
1
Heard quite a bit about this place and decided to go there for a drink and a bite. Should have never made the decision.Firstly the service was HORRIBLE. The ordered some bites and one of the bottles of ketchup had a Long strand of hair stuck on it. The sliders tasted disgusting. We waited almost half an hour before we called the service staff ourselves to clear out plates. Mind you, this was at 4 pm and it was not crowded at all for them to be that busy that they couldn't be more attentive.To TOP it all off, when she was clearing the plates and cutlery, she dropped the dirty cutlery on my Prada bag.Never going back again

Had to entertain my overseas delegates and we ended up at McGettigan after dinner. Your staff Roni was simply fantastic. Great service, fantastic attitude. He even allowed one my guest to sing on stage with the band. Everyone had a great time
5
Great Irish bar in Singapore, Roni was my favourite staff member so helpful and friendly :)Would definitely recommend this bar to anyone visiting Singapor
5
This place is amazing. If you go, ask for Roni - the guy is amazing. Great service, good food, good drinks. The quintessential Irish pub in Singapore. Cheers
5
Watched the McGregor v Diaz 2 fight here a few weeks ago and it was the perfect choice. Great selection of beers...great atmosphere and great staff (especially Roni!!). Highly recommended for anyone heading to Singapore
5
What a great place in Clarke Quay! Came to have a drink and stayed for hours, mainly because of the fantastic service, however the drinks and bar snacks are exceptional. Big shout out to Roui and Paige for looking after us
5
I stopped into McGettigans as I was half starved and in need of a good feed! The barman suggested the beer battered fish an chips as I've always been renowned for enjoying some good fish, It was absolutely delicious and I nearly ate the plate it was that good! A band started playing as I was finishing dinner so decided to whet my whistle. The gent behind the bar went through (in a hell of a lot of detail) the different drinks on offer and concoctions he could make, it was great to chat to a fellow Irishman and we got on like a house on fire! My only regret was my stay in Singapore wasn't longer as I'm already planning my journey home via Singapore just to head back to my new favorite bar
2
The food was alright but the service was terrible. We had so much issues getting the service crew attention for everything - to order, to check on menu items, to pay. I didn't even want to order dessert coz it would just take to long to get their attention again for the bill.It's strange for an Irish pub to have no pie too, but not such a big deal as the level of service standards
4
Good to have a drink through the day or evening, staff are very friendly they will even go to get your cigarettes if there not busy and the minute you drink is empty ask if you need one more.Good meeting place, good sports bar with lots of TV's
5
Great draught Beer, good live music, Monday night is open mike night where some gems (and not so!) can be found. Fun night if you're into the Irish Bar abroad vibe
4
The food were great even though it was a super crowded night. Table reserved was comfortable for us to catch up and watch the match.
5
I was not disappointed in my second visit to this restaurant. Of course it had a tourist focused menu but the food was good, the service swift and the surroundings very clean and tidy.
Good value and so well located in Clarke Quay.
5
McGettigan's was the first part of an Asian holiday and Brian Kennedy and staff provided outstanding service and great food.Can highly recommend anytime you are visiting Singapore
5
Only stopped in for a quick drink on the way to dinner, however thanks to the wonderful service and laughs provided by Ronnie..now known as "Ronnie o Reilley" we stayed for quite a few drinks and even dinner which was absolutely amazing. We thoroughly enjoyed our last night in Singapore because of you Ronnie!!!! You are a great character and made us laugh so much.thank you once again. We will definitely return on our next trip :
4
Stopped in at McGettigans for a quick sip and wound up staying for the evening!! Music started at 7:30, so we stayed there and listened to some great tunes as well as enjoying the last of the happy hour and then some! If you are in Clarke Quay, drop in for a pint and a bite to eat
5
I decided to give this pub a second chance after Brian (outlet manager) personally emailed me to explain the reasons for my terrible experience the last time in July. Food was extremely good and I would say that this place has good happy hour promotion to chill and watch football or F1 with live music.Highly recommended
4
This was our second visit during our stay in Singapore and will be going again too. Friendly and welcoming staff, chatted to Ronnie who works there. Live band with a variety of music. Ate the Irish burger which consists of slow cooked belly pork, crispy bacon and onions with its a fried egg on top. Very tasty was the best burger i've ever eaten
5
Just organized my husbands 40th birthday drinks here. Great location, live music (they even sang happy birthday), great staff, cold drinks. Management even managed to accommodate our large group with only a few days notice. All staff were super friendly and really looked after us during the night.We ordered the sharing platters which were super tasty.Highly recommend having a party here or even just casual drinks
4
You know it is good when the Irish expats defend on this placeGood bar food Wings sliders and calamari are all good choices Great place for a Guinness and live entertainment. The servers are on an Endless quest to clean up the tables so you have to remind them to slow down. Plus you don't just have one server it seems that several work a zone which can be confusing
5
Excelent location and food. Also very friendly staff. A good beer, good music and a cold place in the warmer Singapore. Highly recommended.
5
The staff are friendly, helpful and engaging. The treat you more as a friend than a patron. It's a wonderful venue to escape the afternoon heat and humidity that is Singapore.
3
Had a couple of beers in here after walking around Clarke quay. Nothing stands out and there are better and worse bars. Drinks good and quite a lively atmosphere.
5
Here just hanging out with my darling husband us Irish have to support our OWN ...... staff so friendly ... can t beat de Irish to make new Friends
2
The food is average and the service is bad. The waiter forgot half the order and was pushing us to pay while we were eating. Plenty of room for improvement
5
Came to watch the fight amazing atmosphere. McGreggor done amazing!!Ordered a full Irish breakfast and didn't realise at time of eating was short by a sausage, tomato and mushroom as was a brilliant feast.Mentioned it to the Manager later on jokingly after seeing another breakfast with the full bifta. Without hesitation he came back with a round if drinks on the house. Brilliant customer service!No more Muddy Murphys for me
5
What I love about McGettigans is its location. On the edge of Clarke Quay, but close to the action. The staff are terrific, and you get a warm Irish welcome, even though the staff are not Irish, so well selected!! during the day you can people watch and while away the afternoon, feasting on a relatively small but interesting menu - with something for everyone. I had the mixed Satay twice - yummy. They also have lots of TV screen and they will do their best to let you watch whatever is available on the sports channels. Highlights are the staff, quality of service and location - oh! and the band they have there in the evenings at the moment. Great choice of music and pleasant on the eye. You can sit inside or outside, and seating is pretty comfortable. Its just a great pub/sports bar/place to meet!
4
On their first night of opening, i happen to be in CQ so i say, it looks cozy so went over and tried it with my mates. What's good about this bar is that it has a big area and tables inside and out. They also have a good set of bands that plays inside and a small dance floor for those who fancy to strike a their jagger moves.The drinks are affordable though not cheap. Most of the staff are friendly, though we would understand that sometimes, since they are always busy, they would be a bit cranky but its under stable.I'd recommend this place to everyone who wants a cozy and bit fancy place with live music
5
thoroughly enjoyed our time spent here, sadly only came across this place a few nights before we were leaving Singapore. The staff were amazing, really nice, welcoming and great to talk to, always having the craic and looking after us. Good sized spot for a large group and homely enough just to pop in for a few quite ones. if you have the pleasure of meeting staff member Roni, have a chat with him, great guy. Cant fault this place, it ticks all the boxes for me and the pints of the black stuff are spot on surprisingly enough. We'll be heading back for sure
4
I generally go to McGettigan's for their happy hour drinks. I enjoy their Heineken and Guinness (which unlike most bars in Singapore the staff at McGettigan's know how to pour the proper way). The staff are nice and friendly (although they sometimes are understaffed and you have to try hard to get the waiter's attention). All in all this is a great place to hang out and have a bee
5
Found this place by chance and had a great two nights here! All the staff are lovely but have to say especially our man Roni. He made our nights even more enjoyable, he looked after us so well and we had great craic altogether! It's one of very few places in Singapore that you can have a good laugh with the bar staff, which is what an Irish bar is all about if you ask me! On the second night it stayed open so we could watch the euros and everyone in the place had a great time. They also had a live band and dj which were good also. Would recommend people to go here as you won't be disappointed. The Guinness is good too!
5
I go to Mcgettigan's a couple of times a month. The service is always great and my friends and I love the atmosphere. The floor manager Roni stops by all the tables to check on the customers and is really good at remember names like we are friends (awesome customer experience!). It also stays open late so it is a good place to end the night. Definitely a place to check out on Clark Quay.
1
I had a terrible experience at this place. The food was extremely horrible. Here are my salient points1. Ordered a medium rare steak and got a medium well steak. Potatoes wedges were severely under cooked for some pieces2. Service was terrible. The restaurant manager was not well versed in using the entertainer app and insisted at first that only one voucher could be used (limit depends on no of pax).3. Bill payment took a long time despite me going to the cashier to pay up. To add insult to the injury, the waiter ignored me despite me standing in front of the cashier counter. I had to inform him that I wish to make payment
5
As the events coordinator of The British Association I cannot give enough praise to the staff of McGettigan's for their help and support at our monthly Pub Quiz. The staff can't do enough for us and nothing is too much trouble for them and they always have a smile on their faces!!Food is always delicious and the bar has a great atmosphere
4
Arrived just after 12pm and had the full Irish breakfast. It was excellent! Authentic. Tea & coffee available, although I had a beer. Pub is quite modern & also has a great nightlife. Prices are high, but comparable to all other restaurants/pubs in the area
3
This one of the first pubs that I encountered while wandering around Clarke Quay, and I have to admit that it actually wasn't all that bad. It did take me a little while to warm up to it, and the staff did initially make me feel a little uncomfortable, however I should give credit where credit is due as I did eventually start to feel a little comfortable. Okay, it isn't really one of my favourite places in Singapore, but it is nice enough. Oh, beer is fairly inexpensive as well
5
Great range of drinks.Fabulous fresh food.Excellent entertainment.Fantastic staff.Thanks to BJ, Murphy and Slim for making it a memorable week
5
Stopped in for a cold one on way back from the MRT to the hotel. It had a great environment nice servers, and cold beer sports on many big screens. We made it a daily stop after our day out in Singapore. Food was good too, everything was tasty, fish and chips, pork belly burger, and ribs. All were great. Stop by the Clarke Quay area for a fun night, it is great night life area, and McGettigan's is must stop. Also, they have great wifi.
2
one house tiger beer and asked for one house red ( merlot ) $35.30 you are havin a lend !!!!!!!!!! way too pricey for the venu
3
This Irish pub in located in Clarke Quay and is a great place to sit for a drink or food. We stopped by before going out to a tour and had a couple of quick drinks. The staff were various courteous, quick with our orders and nice. Makes for a great place to rest and take shelter from the heat and humidity with a couple of cold ones
5
Excellent service and food - great to find an actual Irishman managing an Irish pub - great work fergal and the team in Singapore best Irish I have been to ever
4
Good Irish pub , good located with a happy hour from 3 to 8. All what an Irish pub need is here available. Run run run to catch your seat
5
Visited for lunch today with my daughter. Nice bar and restaurant area, plenty of seating available inside and outside. Very clean. Food was excellent and the staff were very efficient and friendly. Will definitely return.
5
My wife and myself, early 60's, dropped into this quant pub.
One truly great, friendly pub, supreme staff, music and the best beer.
Recommend to one and all, a safe environment, clean, and fair prices.
Go Mcgettigans, go, go go
5
Met friends here for the first time and went back three times ! Staff friendly great atmosphere different types of music would definitely recommend anyone to call into this bar😀
4
Hadbabgreat time with the servers and the drinks were cold on a hot night. Food was good bar fare. We went back three times that week.
3
Stopped by here for a snack/drink while on a tour of the city. It was very quiet and therefore difficult to get a sense of the atmosphere during the evening. Friendly staff and good service with typical western pub food menu. Bathroom and toilets a little below what I would have expected. Would I return, probably not
4
Came into the pub to watch a game of NRL from Australia. It wasn't on any of the standard sport channels so Brian got his computer out and live streamed for us. Worked hard throughout the whole game to keep the connection - I was so impressed. Well done lads!And their Guinness is terrific!!
4
Good attentive service. Duo playing soft rock a nice touch. They claim modern Irish and I think it is , if that means none of that pretentious phoney accent (I was in limerick once) type of rubbish just good friendly people providing a servic
4
Visited on 20 april for actual site review for a company event. The ambience and decor is splendid and luxurious. I didn't have the chance to drink or eat the food there but I guess is as good. The outlet manager Fergal was very warming and exuberant in introducing the venue to me. Kudos to that! It was a really pleasant experience meeting with him.
5
Best watering hole in the Irish/Singapore community ... Expect great food, bands, service and events ... Plus ladies nights Wednesday's , as a pre drink warm up before hitting the clubs 🍸xx
Love this place ... You'll see why 😘
4
It's a nice place in Clarke. There is a river near by. Hygienic place and have happy hours too. You can enjoy food & beer here.
4
We ate here on three occasions with a different choice each day and were not disappointed. The standard of food was excellent ith good service and was not expensive. Eat here during happy hour keeps the costs of drinks down.
4
On Clark Quay in Singapore. Pint poured average but drinkable for those who like the black stuff.
The Irish pork burger is a must bar none.
Nice and friendly.
5
Fantastic pub and restaurant. Really good quality food for a pub. Really nice modern decor and much better service than you would normally expect. A bit pricey if you're not taking advantage of any happy hours or other special offers (which we were!) but this is to be expected in Clarke Quay and it's not more expensive than anywhere else around it
4
After a long walk in the heat I need a cold beverage and opted for the low key exterior of McGettigans CQ. The interior surprised me and was a much nicer and refined atmosphere than the exterior suggested. It was a quiet late afternoon so seating was easy, service fast and friendly and the food also much better than expected, my only commenting that they placed the cold salad on top of the hot meat which was not conducive to retaining it's crispness but other than that, it was very good. A huge selection of beverages is available and all served with a smile
5
The drinks are reasonably priced; but for singapore - it's as good as it gets... and they do all the favourites... Erdinger, Guinness for a start. The food is better than a lot of restaurants. The Waguyu burger was as good as I have had and paid 5 times more for in the past. The bands that play are no joke..I am now a resident.So is my wife.
1
Entertainment is great but the service is shocking. If you want to wait 30 mins for a pint and another 10 for your change avoid like the plague. Shame
4
My friend and I walked by this bar on St. Patrick's Day so of course, we stopped in! They have happy hour from 5-8pm (wine, sprits, and draft for $10). My friend got the Irish burger and I got the chicken burger. We both loved our food and the atmosphere was really fun! I can't say the service was all that great, but the pub was packed with people. I would definitely recommend
5
We stayed in Singapore for five days in February 2016 and discovered McGettigan's on our first night. We found McGettigan's faultless. The staff were all amazing, attentive and ensured your experience in Gettigan's was as good as it possibly could be. The Guinness was superb and the food beautiful. McGettigan's roast beef dinner is something which shouldn't be missed! Actually, we found McGettigan's so good that, when we went to Dubai, we found one of the McGettigan's bars there
5
I didn't drink here, but came for brunch. The full Irish was top quality - fully recommend it! It defiantly help me on with my journey after a nights drinking! Lol
3
Nice outdoor sitting area on a corner location. Wide variety of beer and cocktails and an early happy hour. Food is all western/Irish. The pork sandwich I had was tasty but the cut of pork was a bit fatty.
4
A nice, well managed Irish Pub in the heart of Clarke Quay's nightlife area.
Draught beers selection is not huge, but all the rest is ok. Many TV to watch soprts. Worth a visit.
5
Great service! Great chicken schnitzel! Didn't have to wait long for food to be delivered. All for a reasonable price. Highly recommended. Would definitely come back
4
You HAVE to order the wagyu beef nachos when you eat here. You just have to. The flavour and texture are just amazing. It's honestly a party in your mouth, with the warm, well-seasoned wagyu beef chili going with the chilled sour cream and guacamole. It's good for about 3 people, if you're willing to share that is!Drinks were pretty standard, pretty much like what you would get anywhere else.Service could be better though. Some of the waitresses could maybe smile a bit more and make the guests feel more welcome. Also got my drink mixed up once.But it's okay, the bar grub is great! The live music and bands they get are cool too. They know how to get the crowd going.Perfect time to go would be either a Friday or Saturday night when the band plays. You'd be really taking in the full Singapore weekend experience. This place can get crowded, so come early to secure your seats
4
I got caught in a down pour and my usual haunt was shut so I called into McGettigan's for lunch.First up Clarke Quay is a great location but not the cheapest. McGettigan's is right on the riverfront with out door dining and a cool bar and eating area inside.I had the roast beef special and it was brilliant. It was very tender, juicy and had great texture. Cost, well lunch with a pint left little change from $40 SGD but that's pretty much the average cost at Clark Qua
5
You pay top dollar as expected in CQ but they do a good lamb shank. Also a great 'all day' breakfast, if you can wait till midday!! Even includes black pudding. Top of my list for a full English breakfast, well as good as you would expect in Singapore anyway
4
Bar is situated on one of the corner spokes at Clarke Quay so location is pretty good for foot traffic. We cames for a drink and ending up staying for quite a few rounds.Plenty of inside and outdoor seating and the drinks list is reasonably large.We came on ladies night (wedndesay night) so the girls in our group got 5 free drinks and their was a live band playing reasonably early.Overall we all enjoyed our night at this pub
5
Great bar, great happy hour specials and the live music was amazing! Highly recommended. The staff is also very welcoming! Especially Myra (I hope that's how you spell it!) she was very funny and very accommodating
4
Great live music - fantastic singer/guitarist playing on Friday night when we visited, fabulous staff (except Mira/Myra who was exceptionally rude), pretty average food
3
Irish bar in central Singapore. Not my usual stop off in an exotic location, but we went with friends. Great bar and excellent service. Nice decor, with an Asian twist on the traditional Irish style!
5
We stopped by Mcgettigan's and found it to be the best place for a great time. Fergus was behind the bar and poured a perfect Guiness and was friendly - great guy. We're here for 2 weeks and will definitely be back often.
5
If you come here, ask for Mira! She will treat you as a VIP! Excelent music, excellent bar tenders! And the food is gooood! You'll enjoy it :)
4
We tried this Irish bar for our last night in Singapore as we fancied some good British-style food after 3 weeks of exotic meals. The food was really tasty & reasonably priced by Singapore standards. We had the buffalo wings (which are fab), wagu burger & bbq ribs. Definitely worth a visit
3
I had a pint of stout which cost several times more than the UK price. I was surprised to pay more than 19 dollar during 'happy hour', I dread to think what the normal price was.In the evening there is music and lots of TV to watch sport.The location is near the river and there is inside and outside area
5
McGettigan's Clarke Quay was a treat when we visited earlier this week, the food was delicious, me and my husband were on the way on to a cruise when we found the Irish pub in Clarke quay, it was so good we returned the next day with our kids, what a treat, everything about it the way the bar was designed was beautiful simply breathtaking, but we do have to thank one person Mira, for her service, Mira was very attentive to our special orders of food, fast and efficient, and even going a extra mile to provide kid utensils for our grandkids, thank you Mira, you a truly a asset to the company , we hope to see a McGettigan's in Australia in the future, if you're in Singapore, McGettigan's is truly a homey Irish pub a must visit
5
Better food than any Irish pub in Ireland. Loved the chilli. Obviously drink is crazy expensive (like other places in Singapore). But the food is excellent, they should send the chef to train up pubs in Ireland
5
Wandered around Clarke Quay before deciding on McGettigan's for dinner.Happy hour pints of Tiger beer for $10 was acceptable but the meals were more than anticipated.The bride had the roast beef special which was a lovely tender slab of perfectly roasted beef with roast potatoes, sauteed mushrooms and greens.My "Pork Belly Hamburger" stole the show. A thick slice of roasted pork belly with stuffing and crackling along with bacon, egg and chips. NIRVANA
3
Nice pub food, well designed bar and nice service. But..$18.50 for a Guinness is ridiculous. Ciders not cheap either. Other Irish pubs in SG will get you better deals so I'm usually avoiding this place unless meeting up with friends who work nearby
5
Loved the service especially Mira excellent customer service,friendly, music and drinks. Highly recommended for a fun night out. LOVED IT!!
4
We have been here a few times now and tried different things on the menu. We have not been disappointed. Food is good, service is always friendly. Can be loud when they have live music
4
Spent an afternoon here prior to the Grand Prix with a group of mates. Drinks were reasonably priced and we scored a free tasting platter. Staff were a great laugh and service was good. Very attentive. Recommend it for a good Saturday arvo sesh.
5
Good food, pints , sport on TV , very good live music , it's all here , stayed here all here all evening. No need to check out the rest of Clark Quay
4
had a few drinks here at night great band playing drinks a bit
dear but no worse than any where else good vibe servive ok
3
The food was good but the service wasn't. I am here on a quiet Monday evening and the staff are either trying to get you to order when your drink is half finished or clearing the table and glasses as soon as you've paid. I know I'm in a tourist hot spot but this is just rude
4
Conveniently located in the popular Clarke Quay area, this restaurant offers a nice selection of food and drinks. I enjoyed a large portion of fish and chips, washed down by a pint of Guinness. There wasn't a lot of seating, however when we went there around 7:30 PM on a week night it wasn't very crowded.
3
This restaurant is in a great location, especially if you are a people watcher. Definitely not trying to be a Traditional Irish Bar, serves better than average Guinness and Kilkenny in a modern upbeat setting. Beer was no more expensive than in the rest of Singapore bars and restaurants. Service from staff member Mira made the night exceptional, bright bubbly and excellent service, thank you Mira
5
McGettigan's is a great place to hang with, my favourite place for my pint of Guinness, a great place to have dinner at! A must visit in Clarke quay. The staff here is awesome especially Mira! A must visit !
5
I was looking for a good bar in Singapore for dinner and a few pints and my god I found it! Looked at a few reviews and there seemed to be a mixed opinion but for the life of me couldnt understand how people didnt have a good time (certainly doesnt sound like the type of people I'd want to drink with :D ) The atmosphere was incredible and the lad behind the bar I've never met anyone who knew so much about alcohol! I got dinner there too and it was delicious, I was as full as mass on Christmas Eve after it! Great staff, great atmosphere, great pints (got the ride aswell just to top it off ;D
3
Good location but no table service .Waited 15 mins then went over the River for better service.Came back later but still had to go to the BarAt these prices I want waiting on 24/7!Food was good though and good place to watch TV Sport but sort your service out
4
Recently visited Mcgettigans for a few drinks and meeting friends Also watched the Match there we had Such a great time and cool drinks in a friendly atmosphere. Fast and great service too. Would Definitely come back and recommend it. 👍
5
Recently visited Mcgettigans for a few drinks and food. Also watched the GAA there and had 3 great nights. Great food and atmosphere. Would Definitely recommend it. 👍
4
Came in just for a beer and stayed for food too. The atmosphere is fun and the decor fits for the style of pub. The bartenders really are what set the place apart from other, very nice.
2
Soul-less? Yes, I understand that the idea is not to be a traditional Irish pub, or a plastic-paddy bar, but everything about the place screams "fake"... even the very real books on the bookshelves have been defaced, cut to fit the shelves and give a faux-perfect look. There is just no warmth about the place at all.Expensive? Well, it is Singapore, so high prices are to be expected, but some of the food prices were obscene! Similar Irish food items in the older Irish pubs in Singapore are almost half the price, and yet the portion sizes were no different at McGettigans and the quality inconsistent (Irish Breakfast was decent, but the Beef and Guinness pie was distinctly lacking in flavour and had very little beef that I could find).Shambles? It took almost 15minutes after being seated for our order to be taken. We were then brought another tables food before eventually getting ours, and for an Irish pub the staff seemed very inept at pouring Guinness (it tasted decent, to be fair, but the head should be more than 2 millimeters!). And whoever is in charge of the house music hasn't got a clue - lurching from old school rock to thumping trance and all over several other genres.I had been in before and been unimpressed, but didn't review the place then as they were newly opened and deserved time to get themselves sorted out. They have had that time, and now need to take a long hard look at what they are doing
5
My friend and I turned up planning to have some food and move on somewhere else. The food was fantastic. The young lady serving us was called Mira and she was great, good fun and fantastic service. We ended up staying all night and thoroughly enjoyed our night. If you're in Singapore I thoroughly recommend it
4
Went for drinks recently while staying in Singapore for the weekend, but given that we hadn't eaten all day we decided to eat at McGettigan's as well. We were glad we did. The food was fantastic and the service from our waitress was great! Being an Irishman living abroad, some might say I'm inclined to be a bit biased here but most of the Irish bars I've been to don't actually have good food. I would have to say McGettigan's is a cut above the rest - a true GastroBar. Had the chicken fillet burger which was perfectly complemented by the fat chips. Tasty, wholesome food that is really hard to beat. When back down in Singapore will definitely pop in for some grub
5
My husband and I were recently in Singapore before joining a cruise. Whilst in the hotel we were staying, we came across some information about a new Irish pub close by. After some sight seeing we decided to find this venue. From the moment we walked in, we loved the place. The décor is divine and gives a great atmosphere. Upon approaching the bar, we were greeted by a lovely employee, Mira. Mira provided us with an outstanding experience. Mira assisted with menu selection which is invaluable to me as I have food allergies and she advised the Chef directly of this requirement. The staff, however Mira in particular was extremely attentive to our needs throughout the afternoon. Mira's customer service skills where impeccable, from assisting with menu/drink selection to assisting with our tourist questions as it was our first visit to Singapore. A great establishment, well worth a visit and Mira a great asset
2
As mentioned in other reviews, customer service in this place is appalling. I was here with my fiancé on a Saturday night to watch rugby and Gaelic football and had to wait about 45 minutes for drinks on two separate occasions. Needless to say was pretty much ready to say Nevermind by the time the drinks finally arrived. The waitress brought me the bill 10 minutes before we even got the drinks and didn't even apologize when I mentioned this... They didn't even have proper pint glasses for my cider and when asking for that she just said no, don't have any. A simple sorry would take you far but the staff here needs to be taught that!
5
Great atmosphere, excellent food, just very expensive drinks, but that is the same wherever you go in Singapore. Located in Clarke Quay handy to the River boats and a short walk to the SMR
1
We sat down for a snack and a beer I got chicken wings and chips the chicken was not nice chewy. The staff were friendly though. The beer was warm. I wanting a refreshing drink but obviously here is not the place. Not recommended..
4
Food is very good. Drinks are Clarke Quay prices so as expected really.
Live music is usually excellent. Decor is nice and classy and not your typical plastic Irish Pub cookie-cutter approach. Upstairs bar is a great spot for private functions.
4
A great people watching location, really good bar food and fine decor-particularly for a pub. Drinks are as expensive as all get out, but that is the norm for the area. Service varies between wonderful and Manuel standard. Went back several times
1
I would not recommend this bar to anyone ... The staff we encountered on our visit was rude and impolite... If your approach to your customer so out of the way improper... you should look forward to train your staff first before you put up your business..
5
So happy to have found a new haunt near my office where i can chill out to.. Nice decor, my fav glass of white wine and an odd pint of guinness now and then... Cannot believe i went there for 2 weeks in a row almost daily haha.. Guess the draw for me is great service, good food and big smiles from all staff that gets me introducing all friends to this pub..well done and keep it up! See you soon..
5
What you would expect from an Irish Bär and more. A must for any celts in Singapore. Great music (not just Irish folk music), great staff & service, brilliant barman, and delicious food. The manager, Brendan, was outstanding - even got me an apple crumble after kitchen was closed. He personally went round the customers checking everything was good for everyone as well as helping behind bar etc. Only been open 2 months in prime spot in CQ but is sure to do well.

Wonderful experience that I had , the food delicious as me and my husband had fish and chips and I had the soup of the day. Excellent service provided by a waitress Mira, Friendly Irish manager Brendon, excellent decor, It's a must visit if you come to Singapore. Looking forward to visit again when we do return

This place became our "local " while we were in Singapore recently ... Friendly staff, cold beer, nice food & a good location.I read a fairly negative review which initially put us off, but I thought the response from the management was pretty genuine. Turns out that our experience was the exact opposite to what was written, which makes me wonder if some people just like to complain...? Anyway - if you're in the neighbourhood - drop in and have a drink and judge for yourself, we did and we liked it.

What a find! After two weeks cruising my husband was yearning for his favourite drink, Kilkenny. We found it here. A new Irish in Pub in beautiful Clarke Quay. Hospitality was second to non with the manager making himself known on each visit (we got to know him very well), abd a beautiful waitress, Mira. Good pub food, and plenty of it. Highly recommended. A place to sit back enjoy a drink and food and watch the world go by

Love the modern decor of this irish bar, service was very good and the bangers and mash was also very tasty, but my favourite is the cold pints of Guinness. It has an outside and inside area, to see for sport as well. Only downside is if is a little over priced in food and drinks. But I will be back

Firstly we had food here a couple of times and could not fault it either time!! Decor is very impressive. Brendan the manager is very welcoming and friendly. We went to ladies night there and had a brilliant night! Whether it be GAA, soccer or rugby it was available to watch on the tv's! Def worth a visit or 2 while in Singapore!

Great Irish pub, felt very much at home when we arrived, loved ladies night with plenty of free flowing wine would definitely recommend the 'irish burger'!!! The manager Brendan was very friendly and made sure our nights there were enjoyable, we'll certainly pay a visit if we ever go back to singapore

I am writing to complain about the poor food that was rendered at your esteemed establishment.We were a party of 4 as there to have beers and late night snacks, The service was slow and no apologies or reasons for the delay in our food were given. Thus, we ordered the fish and chips and was slimy inside and the quality of the fish was bad, batter was soggy. Nachos came with guacamole that was not fresh tasted like process food and was frozen come with ice bits, and brown flat chips were undercook wasn't crispy also tasteless. The wings were tasteless with a frozen raw taste inside, the mozzarella arancini ball was still cold inside was like rock. The chef is a disaster and disgrace to the company here, when the quality of food is better in Dubai.I was greatly disappointed at the bad quality of food at your establishment and Prices are expensive with no quality in the food. It was certainly a bad experience for a new opening place

Having visited McGettigans a few times, I don't know what the bad reviews are about??The food is always of a good standard, the service is timely and staff are always helpful. The manager replaced a slightly wrong order of mine within minutes and was a great help to our party.We have been there on a night out on at least three separate occasions to watch the bands and dj's. They are all varied, fun and play some great material.Will be going again and recommend it

Firstly, the 'FOOD' IS OVERPRICED. Secondly, I have couples of critics on the food recently. On that night, I had the bar snack menu. I ordered panko prawn , McGettigan's burger & Fat chips. To be honest the food really disappoint me. The panko taste so soggy,' MacG' burger I asked for medium doneness but came to me quite raw and is icy chilled and Fat Chips is under cooked which I think potatoes should be cooked properly. I'ma food enthusiast but after this visit, it is a 'NO' for me. Some of m'a friends did tried out at their Dubai outlets which is far way better than in Singapore. I hope the Group Executive Chef, Derek Flynn would make improvement for the better in future

Admittedly new outlet but this does not excuse the slow sub standard service and food quality. Staff were abrupt and surly so not a good experience for a couple to eat and rest after a long day

Ok,so let me start off by saying that I absolutely loved this place.. My wife and I stumbled in and decided to grab a drink and look at menu.. We met the manager Brenden who was incredibly nice and very helpful.. The Guinness was poured perfect and the food was incredible.. The Irish burger with pork belly is one of the best sandwiches I've ever had... Give this place a try.. The decor is great, food is great, and staff is attentive...

The 1st thing that strikes you about this new Pub is the smart facade of the building outside and the stunning décor inside, which would have cost a pretty penny indeed!Drink prices in Singapore have to be amongst the highest in the world - they are really expensive eg. $15 for a beer or glass of wine....however, many establishments have 'Happy Hour" as do McGettigans, and instead of paying $15, you can get them for $10.The décor and subsequent ambience of this pub is great. The food was OK but my wife's fish was definitely not fresh and you should not be serving up 1 or 2 day old tough fish!However, the pub is new and they no doubt have a few teething issues BUT please get the fresh food side of things right guys.Overall though, it was a pleasant dining experience

Nice location in ClarkQuay but 20 bucks an ale is a bit stiff. If you kept your prices down you might get more real Irishmen visiting. Fun but not that fun.

Visited for lunch on a Wednesday. The establishment is nice and decor done quite well.Staff showed me to the bar and gave me the menu and drinks list. Rugby was playing and music level was appropriate. Approached by the bar lady for a drink....ordered Guinness to be told Guinness is not pouring properly so not being served. This was a little frustrating as I really enjoy Guinness and wanted to see if they pull it properly. I do commend you though for not serving something you feel is inadequate (I hope it's not because you forgot to order the kegs or hooked up the wrong CO2). Offered a Kilkenny in stead which was left to sit...Thank you.Ordered the Irish Burger with the Kilkenny and didn't leave the bill open. The burger arrived after quite a wait of 15-20mins...I understand they are new to open so the wait can be forgiven.The burger was a little underwelming. The bun was soft but the pork belly quite dry.... (soft but over cooked) it really needed more sauce than was provided in the small ramekin. Presentation was nice on the wood board but found the board too skinny to be practical to use as a plate. Parts of the burger falling out and off the plate onto the bar. Chips were ok.It's a shame not be approached again to see if the meal was to my liking or asked if I wanted another drink. I felt because I didn't run a tab the service stopped.Over all I would come back but not in a hurry or for lunch. $50 for a burger and beer is on the steep side for a single lunch but would consider they had a couple of lunch options under $15-$17 price point
