The broth of their ramen is really excellent. With the combination of the ramen and toppings it is really really good. Be sure to come early because waiting line can form early

We never this kind of soup food. You choose between spring, summer, fall, winter or king ! Then you can complete with other specific items.
The restaurant is very popular and the cookers are very gentle and smily.
A good fast food place !

The ramen was on point, best ramen at an affordable price. However, the seating is a little too close to each other, and the staff is normally in an impatient mood.

The most tasty ramen I had in my life!
Not cheap but affordable.
You can adjust ramen by your taste which is great.
Highly recommended

Seriously, don’t be put off that you may have to queue outside. Don’t be put off that they want you to choose what you want before you even get inside. Just revel in the authentic experience of what true Japanese cultured ramen is. The ambience, the feel are amazing, but my goodness the ramen is fantastic. I love this place and thoroughly recommend it to any ramen aficionados

This spicy summer ramen with all toppings I took was devoured at my 2nd ramen joint in 3 days. Like the last ramen I had two days ago, this was very tasty broth, perfectly complemented by a very large slice of pork and seaweed. The was also black and white sesame seeds with a mortar to grind them and put into the broth. When the seaweed was soaked in the broth, it softened and the texture of that softened seaweed went very well with the ramen. With such rich, tasty broth and perfect ingredients, I was inclined to rate this a 5. But still, I would have preferred the broth..which was graded as "normal" rather than "thick".. to be less gooey and the noodle was also normal, nothing spectacular. So I rate this a 4... A very good, which it was indeed

I won't say it is the best ramen in Singapore as it is very subjective to individuals. When I first had it few years back, intro by my friend, I thought it was the best (for me) as I have a taste bud for flavourful stuff (rich and aromatic taste). But after few visits (latest visit just few days ago), I won't be going back any time soon. Not because the ramen standard drops but I would prefer a lighter broth now, after having tasted the authentic ramen in Japan. But for those who have not tried, you should visit at least once if you are in Singapore as it has the closest taste to those in Japan (for tonkotsu broth). Also, try the summer series ramen if you like spicy food. The spicy level is not really that high, probably mild level (for spicy lovers). It is ranked the 2nd best selling in the restaurant. The number 1 is their King Ramen with all toppings and something else. Not sure why it is call King Ramen cos to me, the broth taste the same for all seasons (probably lighter for Spring and Autumn). It could form a long queue during lunch hours, but the turnover is quite fast so, it is still worth waiting and they serve free beverages for patronisers waiting in the queue. They also provide seasoned bean sprouts and hard boiled eggs for dine-in customers for free which you can have them while waiting for your ramen to be served

I like Japanese Ramen. Even though this is part of the Ramen Keisuke chain, claimed to be the biggest in Singapore, I personally find the Ramen very good. Better than some of those highly rated Ramen places. At not too expensive prices. Little wonder there is a queue. It seems like the menu is different at each Ramen Keisuke. At this place, they have 5 types. Spring is cheesy. Summer is spicy. Autumn has mushrooms. Winter is pork broth. King seems to be everything.As is the case with all Ramen Keisuke outlets, there is free flow of hard boiled eggs & bean sprouts. I happened to have free flavored egg vouchers, given for filling up feedback forms at other Ramen Keisuke outlets. Noodle refills available at $2. This place is next to Bugis MRT. Bugis Street night market is just behind. Bugis Village shopping mall is down the road.Definitely worth visiting if you are looking for Ramen.

This chain of ramen stores has not disappointed me, and this one didn't either. It's another small outlet, but still bigger than Tori King. However, even within half an hour after opening, my sister and I already had to wait in line. The great thing was we were allowed to skip the wait as we opted to eat at the counter instead of waiting for a table. Staff handling the queue was patient and organised. While staff within the store seem a bit overwhelmed but got what we needed when asked. This one offers the free flow of boiled eggs and marinated beansprouts - which is great for those who need more food in their ramen. We ordered the Summer and Autumn ramen to share. Both ramen were rich and hearty, differed slightly by the addition of spicy pork or a pork and mushroom mince topping. We both preferred the Autumn ramen more and the mushroom bits were not only fun to eat, they also added a really lovely flavour to the whole ramen. Enjoyable to the very last drop

Love the concept of the shop, FREE eggs and bean sprouts! The ramen is way better than I expected. And definitely won't mind dropping by if I was in Singapore again.

I found out about the restaurant from TripAdvisor. From the outside, the restaurant doesn't stand out from other establishments around it. However, it's ramen is a different story. The menu is limited but that's what makes it brilliant. You can "customize" your own ramen by making some adjustments to the items offered in the menu (e.g. Light/normal/heavy soup base, remove certain ingredients from the dish, etc.). The ramen was delicious and the serving was generous.

This is the 4th times i came here when i visited Singapore. I knew this place from my friend, as we both love ramen so much.I love their tasty ramen, and the flavour is never change. Sometimes we need to wait for the queue, but their serve us quite quick, so it doesn't matter to wait.My favorite so far is their summer ramen.Ah, they also give us free egg

This is my second visit to this restaurant. The taste is consistent. Still nice and good. Service is also very good and fast. Tho we have to queue, they provide free tea for us while we are queueing. And the serving also very fast. Great and satisfying.

The restaurant was colorful decorated, with bright colored paintings decorated the walls. It was interesting that there was tatami mats on the chairs surrounding the counter. One can customize the ramen here, similar to other outlets.  Remember to help yourself to the free flow hard boiled eggs, marinated bean sprouts. There's DIY to ground sesame seeds. There were various condiments also available. Ice water is served after placing order.   Tonkotsu Ramen King ($13.90++)Instead of the usual char Siew, it was served with stir-fried pork with ginger on top. Barely tasted the ginger, but the pork was tender and flavourful with lots of caramelised onions. If you happen to visit the restaurant during your birthday, you will get a freebies too.The ramen was not bad. The staff were friendly and chatty too

When we enter the restaurant, the staff was very friendly and brought us to sit at the kitchen bench. They also told us that there was free flow of hard boil eggs and beansprout, which complements the ramen well! I took the Summer ramen, it is good for those who really enjoy that kick of spiciness! I will definitely go back for another bowl of ramen, maybe this time, the Winter ramen? :

Very friendly stuff when you walked in and they will inform you that there will be free hard boil eggs & bean sprout. Try the bean sprout as an appetizer to open up your stomach follow by choices of RAMENS. Ordered the Winter Tonkotsu Ramen & King Ramen, for first timer like me I preferred the King Ramen as is so flavourful :) For beverages choice, they have green tea cola which I found it very unique. For those who loves to spice up their taste up with some adventure, recommend to try it
