The fried chicken here is very good.
Avoid lunch due to lunch crowd.
The appetiser they gave was so good. ( I believe it's some sort of radish)

Located near the Singapore business district this place is one of the many joints which serves up the famous Korean Fried Chicken. Its hard to miss while walking up Telok Ayer Street. And boy can they cook up a mean dish or two. The traditional spicy fried chicken is one to die for and you just cannot leave a Korean joint without ordering Soju. Fair warning, it can get you quite drunk in no time. Top it up with Cass beer and you are done for. Another dish worth sampling is the sea food pancake. The service is pretty decent and the food arrived in reasonable time. The restaurant isnt that big so you would probably have trouble finding a spot on a friday. But a little patience should yield a seat. They also stay open till pretty late. We left at about 11 and patrons were still coming in. This place is slightly on the pricier side but the finger licking food is well worth it

This is in relation to the Chun Tin branch. The male waiter served us three glasses of ice with one hand. Yes - he inserted his fingers into the glasses so that he can grip all three glasses with one hand. Reminds me of the Singapore hawker scene in the 1970's. I don't think I'll ever come back again

It was our first time trying Korean fried chicken in Singapore and unfortunately it was a negative experience. We ordered the Crunch Original (Wings) & the Sauced Original (Boneless) with the Korean beer Hite. The Crunch Original hit me straight in the face when I took the first bite. It seems full of MSG but when I tried verifying with the staff, they didn't know what's in the flour either as they indicated it came directly from Korea. I didn't think that was an acceptable answer from a food establishment who should be acutely aware of what has been used in the food. Anyway, by the time I finished the chicken, I was having difficulty breathing similar to an MSG attack so I can only assume MSG was present. The Sauced Original was alright, a little sweet but sorely lacking in flavour unlike the delicious & flavoursome Hot Chilli Sauce Deep-Fried Chicken from Kao Kao in Sydney. The only positive experience we had would be the service from the wait staff who were attentive and friendly

As usual, one of my favorite fried chicken and beer haunt and more importantly they open till late...1am. We order various cooking methods of fried chicken and they were are excellent. Both seafood and kimchi pancakes were nice additions too. A reservation is highly recommended during meal period

We stumbled upon this resturant 6 months ago and have been coming back at least once every month. The oven fried chicken is the best. Try the original soya chicken, the kimchi stew with pork and egg are the perfect intro to the excellent food here. The rest is up to you to try. They have 3 outlets but the one we usually go to is located at Tanjong Katong

I've frequented several Korean fried chicken restaurants in Singapore but never really a frequent customer of any. Oven & Fried Chicken serves really delicious fried chicken unique to its taste! All my friends agreed with me as well. You have to try their original fried chicken for an authentic experience! Will definitely return here again and again, as I think I've converted to a fan here. :

Went to OFC instead of KFC when we had a craving for chicken and....decided to have it Gangam Style at Okkudak @ Telok Ayer Street! Place had a cheery feel and the crowd were mostly youngsters (we were the oldies there), in groups of 3-6, mainly friends going out to dine, drink & chat. Service staff was pleasant and service was prompt.We ordered the Crunch Boneless Thigh with Korean spicy sauce (1/2 chicken) to share as we wanted to have some salad and the Kimchi pajeon (Kimchi pancake) too. Verdict? The oven-baked chicken was crunchy, sweet, spicy & flavourful on the outside and juicy, hot & tender on the inside....worth the 25 mins wait! Besides, we were enjoying, in my opinion, the best Kimchi pancake in town (comparable to what I had in Jeju) while waiting for the "main game".Ah....but the meal would be incomplete and your gastronomical experience "understated" without the Korean Farmer's Wine or Makkoli served in a metallic kettle. Go for the "Original Makgeolli". It is a slightly sweet, milky-coloured rice wine native to Korea. There are also other versions of Makkoli like Peach, Orange, Water chestnut etc, so it depends on what you like...but my personal preference is the Original one.Definitely deserving of a repeat visit...perhaps to try the fried chicken and of course, another kettle of Makkoli please!

Restaurant decorations was quite like that in Korea. Ordered fried rice chicken and oven baked chicken. The fried rice chicken was crunchy with its outer skin. It went well with the mild spicy sauce and the honey mustard. The oven baked chicken can be an option for the healthy conscious. The Buchujeon was pajeon with leak. It's skin was crispy. Cold water is provided free of charge. One can also enjoy Korean drama like DOTS and Korean music videos while enjoying their meal
