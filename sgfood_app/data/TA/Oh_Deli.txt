Good place for brunch. Nice staff/service, good food, spacious upstairs. Even has a little butcher place to buy fresh meats.
The only small issue here is the price - slightly higher than what it deserves. Otherwise great little place for food.

The food here is fresh & delicious, though there is limited choice. The coffee & dessert (especially the Banana Cream Pie) are very good!
The ambience is relaxing & Service friendly.
Worth a visit.

Unpretentious, laidback and with good food and coffee. I love almost everything here, from the sandwiches, desserts, hot food to the deli meats and cupboard essentials. It's easily the best-kept secret in the Katong area.
4
The concept is simple: a family-friendly environment, with simple but delicious food composed from fresh meats and vegetables. The jamon iberico ciabatta sandwich is my favorite. Even the coffee is especially nice. It gets fairly busy during weekends, but that adds to the overall ambience.

I went with my colleague for lunch at the Oh Deli. we walk in sat down order the WAGU BEEF which is a Grade 8/9 with some Gluten Sausages. We waited for about 15 minutes and here comes the Wagu Beef Sirloin Steak with mash potatoes. Its was really great the beef taste excellent, I had never tasted such a good wagu beef in my life, we also had some sausages and it was great. After the meal we order coffee latte, the coffee was good. This place also sells food and groceries directly imported from Australia all different kind of meat, chocolate, honey, biscuit, red & wine, fresh mangoes, and chilled bottle juice etc. Its a lovely quirky little place is relaxing and friendly staff and we will definitely be going there agai

We went there for some coffee and scones. I am always in search of good scones as they are one of my favourite foods. I wasn't disappointed as their plain scones were lovely. I prefer fruit scones, but there were none available that day. The coffee is good as well. It's a place with good character and sells food and groceries to take away as well. It's a lovely quirky little place and we will definitely be going there again

I love the food at this deli. It is a butchery cum cafe. The food is delicious. A variety of wines available for wine lovers. It sells different types of meat. It serves cakes and hot beverage too. The service is attentive. I had the opportunity to speak with the owner and hear her inspiring story.
1
The place is in one word horrible.The staff seriously has no sense of customer service and if you do feedback to them they don't care.I rarely write reviews about places but for this one time I would really recommend to avoid this place at all costs! The food is overpriced and frozen, not sure what their problem is but a unpleasant experience
4
Dining there with my son. Not nice and quite place. Thought stuffs are not very alert or prompted in greeting customers they are still polite. Food wise, we order a burger and a roll. We were happy with the way they been made. Tasty and yummy. We also had chocolate mud pie. Its nice but abit too sweet. Would be better is cut down a little of sugar there.

~Foong Chee recommended this little shop for fresh meats and a cosy corner for weekend homemade meals. Upstairs they have another room for small gatherings of about 20pax :)~this time I took a drive out with my wife to have breakfast, parking nearby is really tough to find so any empty lot you see earlier, just park and walk~I ordered the Beef Burger (the sundried tomato di it for me) and the NEW Sizzling Sausage YUMz super SHIOKEveryone here is super friendly (ask for Annie) and you can go on to the counter select what you want cooked and they'd serve it right up, no fuss... certainly a great weekend place to unwin
2
The shop/bar is very chaotic, everything is pre packed where meat is put next too the cake. You can't even look to the wines as the pay desk is in front. Far beter places in Singapore
4
If you like beautiful salads, great wines at very reasonable prices, if you want to bring home delicious meat and more, it's definitely the place.
5
We have been back here almost every weekend. The food is FANTASTIC. You get fresh, honest to goodness food at a reasonable price.
They serve sausages, sandwiches, poached eggs, avocado, spinach.
Coffee is decent.

Oh Deli has really been combined with great memories from my several visits to Singapore. It is an authentic family place on east cost road who put their enthusiasm and good taste on everything they make. Strongly recommended for brunch and all dishes are served fresh and tasty, their coffee is one of the best we have tried in town. Be seated upstairs, the space is very cosy.
4
Every time we visit the place, it's always a pleasure to enjoy fresh salads. Even their hot dishes are delicious. There is a huge offering for wines that you can enjoy at the boutique price + 3 dollars corkage, which is really reasonable. The only negative point, if any, is that sometimes the service is not up to your expectations.

We came in and ordered an English breakfast and a pork burger. Since the English bfast incl sourdough, I asked for a change to mixed grain bread and a skinny Capuccino. The English bfast came with so-called kurobuta pork bacon (supposed to be a higher-end bacon) but it was over done. Not only that, it contained bits and pieces of cartilage...making chewing a nasty experience! But the mushrooms that came with the burger was well-done.We paid S$44 and promptly left. Upon closer examination of the bill, we realised we have been charged:(1) S$1.50 for the wholemeal bread (2 slices...). 2 slices of a new order of wholemeal bread cost $1.50. No one told us prior that there was a charge to change the bread. And if there was, what happened to my sourdough bread that was supposed to come with my English Breakfast set? I have paid for a full breakfast + $1.50 more for the same set less my sourdough bread?(2) there was also an addnal charge of $0.70 for the skimmed milk for my cappucino. Seriously? Again there was no mention by the staff nor the menu that skimmed milk cost extra. But then again, my cappucino never had the normal milk anyway but I had alreaday been charged $4.80 for a cappucino,,,i gathered I have paid $0.70 for the skimmed milk....One incident we could dismiss as a mistake. But 2 in one bill and all in favour of the restuarant tells us that the restuarant is not upfront with its billing....So for all those who are eating there again, CHECK YOUR BILL or just order what is described on the menu and DONT CHANGE ANYTHING...Bitter aftertaste esp as the burger was good....could have just charged me S$ extra for the burger vs creaming off unsuspecting customers like that!When we first arrive, we were told to share a dingly little table in front with 2 other customers. But when other regulars came, they were allowed to go upstairs to dine....very bad feeling for others who are in the main dining area which is already tightly squeezed.

Oh deli is serving a good selection of butchery stuff by the service is poor if you drink or dine there. After first order no one will ask would you like to have another bottle of vine or more food. Hope they can have some resolution on that

Visited Oh Deli for breakfast. I had the English breakfast which consisted of bacon, sausage, egg, tomato along with Sourdough toast. My wife had bacon and egg roll with an added sausage. Washed down with a 2x latte's and a flat white. Total bill was $40. The quality of ingredients was noticeably good and service was quick and efficient. Space downstairs is limited but they have more seating at an upper level. A very nice breakfast and although not cheap it is worth paying for the quality.
5
I moved nearby recently and really enjoy my breakfasts or lunches here. A welcoming atmosphere and great fresh food. I love particularly love the eggs. I'm a regular visitor coming at least twice a week. The cakes are great too although I would sometimes like a bit more choice as often there are only two choices available. It's also a great place for buying fresh spices, meat and veg for cooking at home too!
5
Lived on East Coast for about 1.5years. Would visit at least once a week for a sandwich and to buy some really good quality meats. Excellent sausages - eat in, or take home for a nice evening BBQ. If you do that, I highly recommend investing in a tub of their roma tomato chutney - you will not regret it. The food is so good, but they have literally the best sandwich in the world - Chicken Avocado on Wholemeal Bread. Add bacon and an OJ for the best breakfast ever - every sandwich I eat is measured against this paragon of excellence! The cakes are amazing too. If there is carrot cake you really need to try it, it will be the best carrot cake you ever have in your life! Scones etc are also really good. We now live in KL and miss this place so much

I've been sitting outside more than 20 min and no-one asking any order. Whoah, maybe my last time here.
5
Went to this little deli to buy some cold meat, ended up having a meal as well and I was so impressed with the food I even had a dessert and that was great too, I had the grass fed rib eye with salad and mashed potatoes, it was so good potatoes were light and fluffy steak cooked perfect then I had the cake of the day that did not disappoint either all in all 10 out of 10 thank you oh deli I will be bac

1. Did not take down our reservations or take our reservation seriously. Shoved to one sofa corner... How the hell do you eat properly on a sofa? 2. Waited 30mins for chicken mignon... And I laughed when it came. Pity I can't post pictures here but there's this one tiny wheeny piece of meat and a lot of vegetables for $16.90. 4. And the food wasn't even half as good as what everyone is saying. It's bland and needs a lot of seasoning. 5. Decor is so dated and so old. I think it's supposed to come off as cosy but really it's a lot of funny things slapped together - pop art pictures in one corner, China vases at another.... At the end of the day, we left so dissatisfied that we went opp for hokkien mee.Overall it was a distasteful experience.I will never come here again
5
Recently in Singapore for a weeks holiday from Australia and found this deli come cafe come butchery, it's such a great concept, the coffee is the best I've ever tasted in my life we loved all the food too if you get the chance go we will be going back for sure
5
I have visited this little gem many times over the years, I just cant believe the last two reviews the people are so friendly and so helpful, not even to mention the food and that is" all of it" being so good, there is no where in sing you get as good coffee either, the brand is the best and the barista is as good as oz if not better, maybe they went on a bad day as in the other reviews but every time I have been its been ace, where else in sing can you get real wagyu fresh not frozen for these prices, any way my chicken avocado sanny was amazing and fresh as usual, again the coffee was out of this world but to be honest I would have liked in my cup more but hey its cheap at that, I even bought some Scottish cheese in the shop which I never tasted until I got home and OMG it was the best cheese I have ever tasted will defo be back for mor

Quinoa salad: cooked hot quinoa, no salt , no pepper , no dressing, with few tinny pieces of grilled capsicum and half a black olive chopped. I asked for any kind of dressing and the waitress said that she can add some olive oil. I said ok and also asked for some lemon as well , hoping that they will add lemon juice. The salad came back with 2 transparent triangles of lemon impossible to squeeze but u could maybe lick them after each spoonful, not sure if the olive oil was added...The chicken and avocado sandwich it's very , very bland. It's got nothing to it: boiled chicken breast, mashed avocado- just mashed , green salad and some thin slices of tomato and onion - no seasoning and dressing whatsoever. It's such a shame that the chef or whoever is cooking is so clueless and have zero imagination and doesn't like food or working there and never taste the food. They have very good ingredients and just a little bit of effort would be enough to make very tasty food

Deli produce and food was great. Mainly gourmet products from Australia. But pastries and coffee were disappointing. Service was slow too and didn't feel personal.In summary, if you're looking for take-away meats and cheeses then they have some fantastic options. If you're looking for a place with great coffee and ambiance, then just head across the road to Penny University. If you're looking for good wraps and meat meals, then head to Brotzeit or Immigrants both in Katong.
5
One of my favourite places to visit, whether I'm alone or with friends. The coffee is always good, and I always feel great after having their hearty and healthy Chicken Avocado Sandwich. Their Banoffee Pie is a must-try, though I must give you fair warning - you will crave it and will find yourself back here again and again, if not for the clean flavours of their mains and sandwiches, then the luscious Banoffee Pie
5
To be honest, I'd rather *not* tell you about this place lest you spoil the 'local haunt' feel of the place. I'm not a massive foodie but my wife and I keep coming back to this deli time and time again. The owners/staff are friendly, but service can be a little hit-and-miss at times. However you can expect great taste from the fresh produce at very decent prices - the chicken advocado sandwich is my favourite
5
Back in Singapore again and I just can't see past this place it's great. The coffee is excellent, then I ordered the wagyu beef the marbling and taste of the meat was amazing it was all complimented very well with the rustic salad and the mash potato, my colleague opted for the signature dorper lamb rolled neck roast which was stuffed with spinach, sundries tomatoes and feta cheese with black olive tapenade served with the chefs special quinoa and potato salad, after we had some more coffee and a slice of their homemade chocolate cake once again never a let down in this place 10 out of 10 thanks to the staf
5
I live very nearby and pop in quite often. It's got an amazing butchery and Deli which I think its very good value. You can buy lots of different organic and health foods, wines and some Aussie beeers i havent seen elsewhere (Tooheys Old, Hahn SuperDry).The coffee is amazing, reminds me of Melbourne.The staff and owners are really cool people and friendly. The sandwiches and other menu items are fantastic. Please visit them you wont regret it

We visit Singapore from Shanghai for holiday, first time been in restaurant like this one so many meat and cheese from worldwide, my wife had the lamb with mashed potato and salad she says was 10 out of 10, I had the Australian beef wagyu steak, it also was very good next time we go to Singapore first restaurant we eat in will be this on

This deli /butchery is a must visit eatery on the east coast. As well as great deli food there is a butcher on duty supplying high quality meats and sausages. The coffee is spot on and the breakfast fare is extremely enjoyable. This is a true deli and the atmosphere at brunch is very relaxing. Later on in the day wines and Aussie beers are available. There is also an extensive dinner menu.Do not miss out on eating here

Travelling on business for the first time to Singapore. I was lucky to discover this place. If you want a wide range of good quality fresh foods I recommend visiting this place. If you want junk food go to McDonalds. I enjoyed the dining experience so much I kept going back. I enjoyed the beef and lamb dishes. The meat was like no other I have tasted it was very tender and tasty. The sausages were out of this world in a range of flavours. I also had sandwiches to take away, fish dishes and poultry. If I Was a resident of the city I would probably shop there too as the shop has a facility for selling fresh produce that is offered to diners. Alan M, Inverurie, Scotland

I have never been a big fan of sausages but I had a change of heart at Oh Deli. These sausages are made as a labour of love with quality ingredients and care. Kiwi Dale Pitchers who works there explained the process. It was a very tasty meal indeed
5
Been here before and every visit it just gets better, they have a wide range of foods all are excellent, I don't really have a sweet tooth but this time I tried the banoffie pie and my gosh it was the treat of dreams, I will definitely have this again and as always I will definitely be back thanks agai

Very nice food and coffee, but the service really lets it down. The staff are polite and well meaning but I don't think they've had any training.For example, if you sit outside you'll wait a very long time before someone notices and comes out to serve you. Once served, you'll never be asked if you want another drink etc. There are also confusions about the menu items, with sandwiches arriving minus some of the ingredients listed. They then try to say that the 'menu has changed'. Surely better to explain that when you order, or alter the actual menu?If you want wine with your meal, you have to buy a full bottle, not available by the glass, and bizarrely they charge corkage. Yes, they actually charge you extra to open the bottle!Corkage is traditionally charged if you take your own bottle of wine into a restaurant, not if you order a bottle in the establishment. Very cheeky so I never ordered wine again there
5
Myself and a friend were walking on east coast road and found this great deli shop, the food was so fresh, I had the wagyu steak and it was the best I have ever tasted, my friend had the all day breakfast and the whole lot was excellent although the sausages were out of this world, KFC say finger licking good this should be the motto of this place absolutely amazing, they even sell meat etc to take away - soo good defo be back, the service was also second to none and the bannoffe pie was to die for.

My husband and I have eaten breakfast here in the past and were satisfied with the portions and flavour. The lunch today was filling and I took half of it home to finish later. The deli has meats and sausages for sale as well as pasta products, falafel mixes, sauces, and many types of unusual cookies and health bars available. This place is worth a visit for breakfast or lunch. There are a few seats outside and the tables indoors are cleverly converted treadle sewing machine units. Staff is friendly and helpful. Both visits were delightful.

wow this place is great and so cheap, they have a great selection of meats, cheeses, wines, beers basically everything, the staff are so friendly and helpful, i was amazed when i found this "glory hole" in singapore, defo go back for sure and would recommend to anyone
