A great place to dine and they serve one of the best hainanese chicken rice and nonya cuisine. It is authentic and excellent service. This is at Serangoon gardens way next to the standard chartered bank. It closes at 10 pm.

Food was good and price was quite decent. Aircon setting and this could be a nice place to bring your family for a good chicken rice lunch!

GO there, order chicken rice with their steam chicken is more than enough. However, they do serve others menu as well, which is kinda funny. Please do order their fish curry. The food is very nice, and price is withing affordable range as well. The chicken rice is nice, the chicken is smooth, silky, and not dry. The curry fish is in a very big portion and definitely worth the price. Chili for the chicken rice is very delicious. And the food come out very fast, which is good especially when you are hungry

We went to Nyonya food cum Chicken Rice. A pleasant choice. We had steamed chicken. The flesh was juicy and soft. We also other side dishes like salted fish and beans sprouts, kailan, omelet with onion and grilled fish stuffed with sambal. All were very good choices. Service was fast. Very well prepared food. Prices were very reasonable.

Bad service. Waiters and waitresses come to your table expecting you to take the plate off their hands and set it on your own table yourself. The owner (?) of the place came to our table to take our order, didn't say anything and wasn't wearing proper uniform, I thought he was a random stranger. Environment and ambience was terrible. Have never been to a noisier restaurant. Clashing of plates and bowls, scrubbing and cleaning chopping of chicken, closing and opening of cabinets, a random ringing alarm that went off and nobody bothered to check, and kept on ringing. Food was terrible. If you're looking for chicken rice, you can get better, more value for money chicken rice elsewhere in hawker centres. Ordered a stir-friend nyonya spicy squid that was so dry and hard it tasted like twigs. Will never come again.

Tried this after seeing good reviews. We ordered Hainanese chicken (S$14/half), kailan veggies, crab meat tofu. Chicken was juicy and good, chix rice is not oily. Tofu dish was not good at all.They gave us a pickled veggie appetizer and napkin wipes, surprised it was charged on my bill. Make sure to tell the server jot give you these anymore. Service was fast, place comfy with a/c. Overall, I'd go back for the chicken rice and nothing else.

Touted as one of the best chicken rice in town, Pow Sing is supported by many recommendations from blogs and internet reviews. It's been in the business for 3 decades. So we just had to track it down one evening. It isn't too easy to reach, due to its location at the upper side (north east), near Ang Mo Kio. We weren't disappointed though. The service level and food taste are better than expected. Especially the service - warm and attentive. Far from the often cold treatment that "old" restaurants are known for. It was a letdown not to have roasted chicken on the menu but their speciality of hainanese chicken rice is more than enough. Together with this dish, I recommend you to try the tofu in crab sauce, and the kaylan veggie with garlic. Pair them with either cold barley drink or hot Chinese tea.(Their menu includes set meals good for 2, 4 or 6 people, and even more, for value-for-money dining.)Bit of a warning - chicken rice can be fattening due to the oil content and the chicken skin. So you may want to remove the skin and just enjoy the white meat. Guaranteed to satisfy.

Love this place! If you are a fan of chicken rice, this is the place. Chicken is smooth as silk and not too oily. Other dishes like their sweet and sour pork ribs, crispy tofu, otah, nonya vege rolls and curry fish head - are just a few things to eat when you are there. Very casual dining, service is fast and good. Owner is always on site and giving excellent service.On weekends they have their own personalised valet service. Great place to bring friends who are out of town to eat some good hainanese chicken rice.
5
I am very proud that it has never failed to satisfy my palate over the years. Whether it's for a simple family get-together meal or for entertaining out-of-town friends, Pow Sing offers satiating meals.Of course, the Hainanese Chicken rice with half or full chicken and pure cabbage clear chicken soup can be a meal by itself. Very often though I would order the fried tofu which is slight crisp on the outside and smooth and soft on the inside to be dipped in a hoisin sauce (optional) compliments the meal. In fact, most of the other dishes offered won't disappoint either. Reservation is advised

Pow Sin has been one of my favourite place for chicken rice since I was in high school 30 years ago. But my recent visit has been very disappointing. The chicken was dry, rice lacks fragrance and the chicken portion was pathetically small. The chilli is still good and the nonya cabbage roll was delicious but hey I went to Pow Sin for the chicken rice. I might return and give them a chance in future but right now I need some time to get over this disappointment

One of the better chicken rice in singapore. Many other good dishes like curry fish head can be ordered too. However, it can get quite crowded and you have to wait.
4
We visited this restaurant last week. The location was away from downtown however it s great place with less crowded people during lunch. Also ordered fish. It was fresh and nice taste! Great choice and please to come back by taxi next time
4
I like the chicken here, and also the balacan kang kong and crispy beancurd. They r consistently good. The curry fish head and their prawns are not always nice, especially during peak crowds.
5
They have two outlets in the same row of shops. Chicken rice served in both.outlets. Good value. Surrounded by other quality food outlets, of all types, if you change your mind.
3
The family has been eating this chicken rice restaurant since it was operating as a stall in Carden coffee shop in Serangoon gardens. We have been constantly patronising this shop . The taste is still very good. The roast meat is a must order. The fragrant rice is really nice couple with the succulent roasted chicken , it's a must, strongly recommege
5
We're regular customers to this restaurant. We regard it as our external kitchen since we're living very near by. It is well-known for their Hainanese Chicken Rice and a variety of peranakan dishes. Our favourite dishes include the following: Chicken Rice of course, slice fish with ginger, fried tu foo (bean curd), sambal belacan kang kong, otah wrapped with cabbage, fried prawn paste chicken wings and otah. If we are a large group we would order curry fish head. This restaurant is usually crowded. You're advised to make reservations and to go there early. There is ample parking lots in front
3
My friends decided to give me a treat today and I was looking forward. The so-called lady captain came to take out orders. We ordered belacan Kang Kong, Spinach with mushrooms, fried tau foo, ngor hiang, half a chicken and fish maw soup.The chicken rice is not oily n still taste good. The chicken still tender and smooth. The Kang Kong is too old n I feedback to the lady captain. She replied "where got old". I told her that this is a feedback and not a complain. She should pass the info back to the kitchen chef, instead of giving me such a comment. The ngor hiang tasted as they were re-fried. The spinach was OK. The fried tau foo was OK. The fish maw soup....the fish maw is not cooked till tender. Under cooked. The soup was just average. The fishballs which came with the soup were very average. Overall, the side dishes from the kitchen are below average. The chicken rice n the chicken still taste good. Just focus on the chicken n the rice. Forget about ordering other dishes

Pow Sing is one of the well known restaurants in Serangoon Gardens. It's the go-to place for chicken rice, especially for those who live in the area. It started humbly as a stall in a coffee shop, and slowly expanded to both a restaurant as well as a smaller kitchen that serves roast chicken and other dishes. I would take overseas guests to Pow Sing for some authentic chicken rice as well as asian cuisine. The restaurant serves white chicken only, but has other Peranakan dishes on its menu. On top of the chicken, I usually go for the crispy beancurd as well as the curry fish head. The sambal kang kong is also nice. Expect to pay usual restaurant prices, but it's great for groups.Staff are also friendly and offer their honest recommendations (They would even tell you that you've ordered too much; or suggest for you to not order more, and wait to see if there's sufficient food first.
4
Chicken has just the right texture and without much fat. The rice was well cooked and not to oily or salty. The fried tofu was crispy on the outside but soft inside. The dipping sauce was very good. The baby kai lan was served in a generous portion and cooked just right giving you a crunchy feel when chewed. The price was, however, on the high side for both the food and drinks. Overall, a good place for dinner but be prepared for crowd. Highly recommend for occasional group gathering
4
Though chicken rice are sold commonly throughout Singapore, Pow Sing's ones are commendable as their chicken and rice are consistently good. Not overpriced & half chicken costs $14. We like their kangkong with balachan too. Fish head curry is nice but varies in standards and costs $38 now
3
The chicken here is very delicious. Love to eat here with my family. You can also order other dishes so that your family can enjoy a balanced meal. They also have vegetables and nutritious soup.
4
My favorite chicken rice in town although the location is a bit remote. The chicken is tasty. There are also authentic peranakan food. Worth a visit if you are tired of other chicken rice in town.
5
Let us just be clear that this is not the kind of place tourists stumble upon by themselves. It's also rough and ready, high-salt, high-cholestrol food from the good old days before Western scientists had sullied the local food scene with inconvenient dietary findings. That said, their Peranakan dishes definitely hit the mark as far as taste is concerned.The one dish I have always ordered over the years with a variety of dining company has been the deer meat with black pepper. One or two of the wait staff have even begun to pre-empt my choice of it. Definitely recommended
2
No doubt the food are great but we encounter rude staff that is rushing us to get our orders and it seems she wanted us to make our orders the fastest. Then beside us is another table of Ang Moh and she is the sweetest and most hospitable... Double standard in action...truly a spoiler
4
Went there for lunch on Sunday with my family. The chicken rice is good and fragrant yet not too oily. The chicken is very tender. My favourite dish is their homemade tofu - soft and tasty. Other dishes like deer meat and pork chop were not too bad. The only disappointment was the curry fish head. I think the curry spices is too overwhelming.The prices are reasonable for a restaurant. Services is average because lunch time is very crowded
4
We didn't try their chicken rice, as we were making a beeline for the Peranakan dishes. Very good selection of fare and I must say that the treatment was just nice. Especially tasty was the trotters braised with assam wings (assam gelugor) for a really lovely tartiness
4
This guy used to run a stall in the coffee shop wihch is today the Citibank. Slick hairstyle, clean faced, "Pow Sing" made juicy steamed Hainanese Chicken and Fried Chicken. Rice is the real deal. Of course, he made it good, opened up pow Sing and the rest is history, Que for your Chicken my friend!
4
Known for Hainanese chicken rice and Nonya dishes, their roast chicken which they have been serving since their early days in a traditional coffeeshop, is one of the best in town and more deserving of attention. Always crowded at meal times, reservation is recommended for large groups while they have started to offer valet parking due to the limited public lots available in the Serangoon Gardens area
4
If you are near Serangoon Gardens and craving for good chicken rice and Nyonya dishes, Pow Sing is definitely a good choice! Ask for the white Hainanese chicken and you can order other dishes like curry fish head (enough for table of 10), sambal kang kong, fried chili sotong, fried Nyonya tofu, lemon prawns, etc. The chicken rice is very fragrant and comes with good chili and garlic sauces. For deserts, you can go with Chendol. This restaurant has a long history at this present location and most of the locals who stay around this area know the place. The staff are generally attentive and helpful on the few occasions I visited. There is another similar name restaurant further down, I have not tried but also see strong crowds too

Nothing much changes with Pow Sing apart from the new cafe style eatery a few doors away. The restaurant eatery still has the same menu served by Aunties who seems to have served there for a long time. I had half a steam chicken, a nonya chap chye and a deep fried eggplant. The chicken is tender and a but fatty and seems to be quite a small portion for $16.50. The nonya chap chye has an overdose of soy sauce but the eggplant was done to perfection. Paid $41 for 3 adults lunch

We just returned from our overseas assignment, and the first Chinese Rice Restaurant we seek out is Pow Sing. They serve authentic tender Hainanese Chicken Rice here. There are other delicious Chinese food you could try here too. And the price is very reasonable. This is where we entertain our friends regularly
5
Yes we've been coming here almost all my life and that is what we affectionately call Pow Sing since we bring so many of our visitors there. My favourite is actually not the chicken but rather the nonya dishes, esp the tau hu with dark sauce, soft n moist otah with just the right spiciness, n many more..

I have some complicated feelings about fusion menus. My first response is not to trust it.  Well, there are impressive fusion-food out there but do note that this is not fusion-food or anything close to that. It is FUSION MENU. And when it comes to fusion menu, it is like the universal code for "We will serve anything if you are willing to pay for it".  The first impression about Pow Sing is that they are famous for their Hainanese chicken rice. However when you walk into the restaurant, you will notice that not every table ordered the chicken. I guessed we should have learned from them.  On their menu you will find Peranakan dishes, Hainanese, Cantonese, Hokkien, Teochew and even Bengali dishes. You will also find specialty dishes like Shark's Fin Soup and Braised abalone. We decided to go with the chef recommendations like Ngoh Hiang, Otak, Bakwan Kepiting, Fish Head Curry, Babi Ponteh, Stir-fried Spinach, served with chicken rice.  Taste is subjective but terrible food is terrible. They were all terrible. Some under-cooked, some tasteless, some overpowered with spices trying to cover up that frozen, stale pork taste. Together with the chicken rice, nothing compliments. At many times, it is confusing.  Or was it meant to be a distraction since they are unable to serve selected good dishes that they can call it their own
4
This is a good place for chicken rice in Serangoon area. Well run restaurant,clean, comfortable, good air conditioning and ventilation. I will come back. Other dishes were good too. There are 3 dish sizes(s,m,l) so tell waiter or you may get all large size and may be too much. I would ordered all small sizes but large plate of chicken ( one chicken)
5
Other than their famous Chicken Rice, there are several delicious food at this restaurant. If you have a group of more than 4 people, the Curry Fish Head is one of the dishes to order. My all-time favorite dish is the Nonya Crispy Tauhu. It's cripsy on the outside, yet soft in the inside. The serving time is reasonably fast, however, the seats inside are abit cramped. but other than that, I am happy eating at Pow Sing and my friends enjoy it too~
5
Their chicken rice is simply the best. The chilly is the best and so fragrant. The other dish are also my favourite like their soft fried tofu, sotong, and especially their deer meat black pepper which is beyond words to describe. I always have a good time whenever I eat here. I always find the time to come here whenever I visit Singapor
1
Was there yesterday. Chicken meat is nice but rice is hard and non tasty. Service is the worst. You have to chase for orders and the place is very noisy and painfully unbearable. After finishing the food, they will hurriedly clear the table while you are still talking and tucking away on last few dishes of food. Certainly will not come here again to enjoy the high decibel noise nor the poor service. Food are meant to be enjoyed.
4
Very soft and smooth Chicken, the rice is not too oily, just nice. The chilli Kangkung, the "haychuo" (Prawn Fritters) and most the vegetables are also very good.Only thing is, unless you come at non peak hours, you may not find parking spaces.Drink of lime juice to compliment the dishes will be best
4
On my business trip, I had a chance to try the chicken rice here. You can not imagine this taste if you don't try it.It was said that the chicken rice here was the best among the best. The chicken was tender and the rice was tasty. It would be a big mistake if you forgot to order crispy tofu. Well-done!The service was quick and efficient.Check it out if you are on Singapore
4
Been patronizing this restaurant since young,usually visit atleast once a week.Food here has always been consistently good,to me the chicken rice here is the best or atleast among the best in Singapore.Condiments for eating(chili sauce,ginger) are on each table and replenish able.This is one of the few places where water is complimentary as well.Worth noting is that the owner actively helps out in taking orders and delivering food to the table.Do try all the dishes,they're all pretty good.They do have raspberry flavored jello which is really interesting and a must have treat for me on every visit
5
The texture of the crispy tauhu is nicely done, soft on the inside and crispy on the outside. It goes well with a pot of curry fish head! Amazing combination! Portion wise, would recommend the fish head for 4 pax. The fish is fresh and the curry was flavourful. Not too spicy, just RIGHT! A pot of fish head is priced at sgd 32-36. Staff was attentive n forth coming with their service.
3
went to visit the food markets over the road from this restaurant but they were very busy and we decided we would just go to this restaurant. The food was reasonable, nothing spectacular but the service was quick and efficient. The staff were good-it seem like some of them were family. It was just a nice meal with drinks and a bottle of wine for around $110 SGD
5
You can't go wrong at Pow Sing. The chicken is so tender and the rice nice and fragrant. A musnt miss dish is the thai baby squid which is a great appetizer. Pity the portion is relatively small. Other great dishes are ngoh Hiang, tofu and oyster omelette. Decent prices, hit and miss service, but excellent foo
5
I have known this neighbourhood eatery for years and much of the dedicated staff remain, even as family visit every year or so from the UK for the past 20 years. It is a firm favourite for the family - our children from UK grew up to fully appreciate the special flavours of Chicken Rice - and no return visit to Singapore is complete without a few meals at Pow Sing. The skilled chef who deftly carves each chicken to meet the relentless demand of diners is a joy to watch! The Nonya specialties on the menu are also highly recommended. In a country where good food and dining is a competitive art form for the locals, Pow Sing holds its own in the leafy suburb of Serangoon Gardens, the former residential stronghold of ANZUK Forces families. A must-visit

We love to be a couple of very few caucasians in "Eating Houses" or "Coffee Shops" in Asia and Singapore offers the best of the best variety of Asian food in the world. You will find the very best restaurants as well, but our "kick" is to eat local and excellent. To Pow Sing I have introduced many Singaporean with great success. I have not written any review though I have been visiting Pow Sing for the past 16 years. More reviews below that tell you what is good on the menu. It is easy : everything! !Pick and choose from picture pointing menu were what is served looks almost identical to photo. One serious advise, if you are a foreigner visiting, do not expect fluent English, happy smiles and superb service. Food comes to the table (elegant eating house standard) effectively and delicious. You eat, pay and go. Enjoy rubbing shoulders with the locals. Do not go there for a romantic candlelight dinner. Serangoon Garden has many al fresco casual coffee shops with excellent food and one of the most popular hawker centres "Chomp Chomp" ! Print address for taxi ex. city abt. 10-15 SGD one way. Good luck
5
This is the best chicken rice and it is always my favorite. Always maintain the quality. Important is if you like chili and ginger, they have the best condiments! Service is good. Still the original staffs after years. Always packed with people in peak hours. Best herbal chicken soup, fried Tofu is just something that you should not miss other than the chicken.

Friends took us to Pow Sing last weekend. Parking was a little difficult but we got a space after about a 15 min wait. There are two Pow Sings which are two doors away from each other, we opted for the older location as the menu spread seemed larger.Food was good. The Hainan Chicken was juicy and cooked just right. The crispy sotong was excellent. Crab ball soup was a little lacking in flavor (must be frozen crab meat). Service was less than attentive and drink orders were forgotten, twice.Overall, we will be back for the food
4
My family & I have patronised this restaurant countless time. The steamed chicken rice is excellent. The restaurant serve Peranakan cuisine as well & you will get great food no matter what you order. For the new patron, try a mouthful of the chicken with rice. Then with the condiments: chilli, garlic & dark sauce. Mix as your taste desire. The service is alright. Nothing fancy, after all this is a family-run, modest restaurant in a suburban setting.
5
Knew them already from when we lived in Singapore, so when I was on a business trip and could lunch there with some colleagues, I was delighted. Yammy! Like more authentic restaurants in Singapore the place is simple and not something special from the outside or from its decor. But the food...aha, that is another story. We had fish head curry, chilli kangkong, and some other local delights. Even the atjar sidedish was wonderful. That I as an ang moh can have the joy to eat this fantastic food - a real privilege. If I compare this quality and variety with what Asian food I can get in my hometown in The Netherlands, the contract is vast. If you like Peranakan food from the Straits, you should definitely try them
5
Pow Sing has been around for more than 30years in Singapore and it serves excellent hainan chicken rice. They also have a menu whereby you can order other nonya dishes. I recommend the chicken rice, sambal kangkong, otah, assam pedas fish, signature home made tofu. Prices are not expensive too. Highly recommend this place. It's located in Serangoon Gardens
5
All I can say is firm skin, succulant & tender meat, perfect chilli, ginger and black sauce. Put that all together and you have the perfect hainan chicken rice party in your mouth.
3
Too much MSG!
3
chicken smooth/rice nicely cooked/chilli hot...(coffeeshop)
3
The food quality used to be better..
2
only complaint is the parking! go for the corner coffeeshop for the cheaper version.
4
go early if you don't want to wait for a seat. chicken rice is yummy delicious. we also tried the otar, assam fish, fried chicken, seafood toufu, kang kong, babi pontek and fried squid. staff were polite and are able to recommend dishes as well. place can get noisy when crowded
4
Stumbled on this restaurant by accident was looking 4 Korean but was closed so tryed here as it looked busy! I'm a tourist n my friend from Singapore was taking us out! He never heard of this place either but said it serves local dishes n ordered 4 us with r preferences. Had great mix of dishes, steamed chicken , the meat was so moist amazing best chicken I've had maybe!!!! Chicken rice well flavoured. Black pepper chicken nice with a kick. Pork ribs loads of flavour , shark fin soup tryed 1st time was nice. The pickles they serve u were lovely bit like kimuchi . Then had spinach n garlic really good, lady finger (okra) with spices very good, mixed veg with garlic cooked well. Food was overall very good service friendly n helpful think it's run by family. Reasonable value I thought 4 dishes 3 diff portion sizes. But we decided get sml sizes n more dishes 2 try!
5
The best steamed chicken in tow but the rice could be better.Went there with the family and apart form the Chicken Rice, we also ordered Crispy Tauhu, Ngoh Hiang and Sambal Kangkong. Top of my list was the Chicken. Do not know how the do it but is was just soooo good. Although I am not a fan of Chicken Breast meat, the meat Chicken Breast from Pow Sing is moist and tender.As I indicated earlier, the rice could be better. I think that the rice served by Boon Tong Kee is better in texture and fragrance. The Crispy Tauhu, Ngoh Hiang were great but eating the Sambal Kangkong was like chewing hay. Service was below average. Especially at peak time, all they are interested is to serve your meal quickly and present your bill even quicker.Definitely a family type establishment and not somewhere where you can have a decent conversation without having to shout over the din
4
This restaurant serves steamed chicken rice and peranakan dishes. The rice is cooked to perfection, fluffy and flavorful unlike many other chicken rice stalls that serve rice that is undercooked or dry. A must-try is the curry fish head. For those who prefer roast chicken, head to the new restaurant just next door, also run by the same owner. He is there most of the time to supervise his staff.
4
Located near the famous Chomp Chomp hawker center in Serangoon Gardens, this restaurant is a treat when looking for an air conditioned restaurant. It is most famous for it's Hainese chicken rice. It was one of my favourite meals when I first visited Singapore 10 years ago - and I needed to ensure it was one of my top priorities when I visited last Christmas. The chicken rice is fragrant and flavourful and the steamed chicken was moist. Other memorable dishes included deep fried tofu (crispy on the outside - while soft on the inside) and deep fried squid.It will be more expensive than the average hawker center prices, but it's still reasonable and the atmosphere is casual. It's a very popular place so if you have a large party for dinner, I would recommend calling ahead to reserve a table. Parking is challenging so I would recommend parking in the neighbourhood streets.I am looking to my next visit - and this restaurant will be back on top of my list
3
There's plenty of chicken rice in this area, pow sing does it pretty well if I remember the last time correctly.
4
has some nice side dishes too...
3
Nice peranakan food and reasonably priced.
3
Chicken is very smooth, but perhaps because of how it is cooked, loses the chicken favor. I prefer favor to texture
4
One of my favourite stalls. Roast chicken's well made, chilli's really good!
4
love the crispy tofu!~
3
Dishes are a bit saltish...
4
chicken- good.. otak- tasty!

Nice chicken rice - the chicken has a smooth texture.

Chicken rice is nice with the dishes but its rather costly
