Ambience is wonderful. Quiet place good for lunch with friends or for business. Food portion just right for lunch
5
Good lunch place. View is good. Service is good. Tried the set lunch. Price is very reasonable. Food is above average but not fantastic

I was in Singapore on business and tried a number of different restaurants while there. This place was by far the best. Very reasonably priced, high-quality food, superb presentation with a beautiful view. I got the middle range set menu that comes with 3 courses. It was delicious. I enjoyed the Salmon Tartare, Beef Steak and Cheesecake. All under the lunar eclipse. To top it off they serve 12 dollar cocktails, that were mixed perfectly and not skimping on the liquor! Highly recommended

My meal was excellent however prices ware somewhat high, i dined in the hotel only on my first night

Christmas eve dinner, decided to check out this hidden gem, the place is cosy & small but the outdoor view is great. The food is surprisingly good so is the price & service
4
We decided to try this restaurant as the Christmas was appealing.It was a good and interesting discovery.Very reasonable in term of price versus the quality and originality of the meals Limited wine list but a very decent price.Interesting view on the CBDWorth to try during the eveningQuiet place : only a few tables
5
What a great day to start the day...everything was delicious, especially the omelettes. The view and the service from all the staff was faultless
4
Interesting restaurant at the top of Wangz hotelThey propose an amazing value for money ratio lunch set.Quality is Ok but presentation of the dishes is really niceThe place is quiet (for lunch), luminous, and service is good(4 rating is probably too much but a 3 would not be fair
5
Excellent food quality with decent portions and value for money set lunch. The service was very good and it’s in a convenient location just outside the CBD

Tired of the usual rip-off at hotel fine-dining restaurants? Then you are in for a treat here at the Upper Place, a tiny place with great views of the evening city sky line. Grab a drink alfresco after sun down and then adjourn for a really decent dinner that doesn't break the bank.The oxtail stew is deep in flavours, served with an option of rice or sourdough. Interestingly sprinkled with lemon zest for a thoughtful contrast.Mushroom soup was an inventive emulsion poured over flavoured crackers right at your table, very modern indeed!Try the set lunch for even better value. It's quiet and tucked away, making it a good place for confidential meetings.Service was warm & genuine. The waiter made sure we knew that a 20% discount is available for NUS or SGH faculty. Unbelievable 
5
Second time I've been to this place. Food on both occasions were excellent, meticulously prepared to a very high standard. View of the city was an added bonus to the entire dining experience.
5
Fresh ingredients prepared & served fresh! For those who love healthy, less salted food, this place is for you!

If you are looking for a wallet friendly fusion restaurant to enjoy a quiet dining, Upper Place is just what you are looking for.

Earnest staff, a bit nervous but warm enough to want to please. Food is great although a tad heavy on miso for certain dishes e.g the roast chicken and the scallops.

I went to the Upper Terrace restaurant a couple of times for breakfast and dinner as I was a guest at the Wangz hotel.  The menu is not extensive but all the food was fresh and perfectly prepared. Some of the dishes were not available but the rest can satisfy everyone's taste. I did enjoy the 'Westholme Wagyu Rump' - beef with burnt shallot, potato mash and baby leeks - which was a bit spicy but exactly to the balance; the 'Baby gems salad' with asparagus, truffle honey, shaved pecorino and toasted hazelnuts; the 'Norwegian salmon tartare' was also one of a kind; and as the classic tiramisu I have tasted only in Italy. The breakfast which is included in the room's price was buffet with not too many options but good enough to give you a good start for the day. The service was fast and all the staff were polite and attentive.  They also have outdoor seating which offer nice views of Singapore and it is good for romantic dinners or just a glass of wine.  The prices are mid-range and being on the rooftop of the Wangz Hotel with so many dining options around, it can be easily overlooked and missed
1
Very reasonable priced with friendly staff but the food was a miss. Lots of food wasn't available and service slow. The place gave the feeling that it was in a closing down sale (three tables on a Friday night!). Give it a big miss

The rooftop restaurant of Wangz Hotel is a quiet respite from the city and a bit of a hidden gem. It's not one of those hip restaurants regularly featured in magazines write-ups and so remains largely under the radar. Which is a bit of a shame. While I wouldn't say it's a budget restaurant, you do get pretty good value for what you pay. We had the set dinner, and the courses are all taken from the a la carte menu. Food was plentiful and the service excellent. Would be going back this Friday for lunch. Let's see what the lunch menu looks like.

Was there for a birthday celebration but the food fell short of expectations . The signature items like laksa risotto was not available that night as well
3
Good food is available all over Singapore so restaurants have to fight for that extra 'something' the Upper Place didn't have it. It was a quiet night that never helps but service was a little slow and ambience absent. The food was good though so this reads a little harsh.
4
Brought some overseas friends for lunch, they love the food which was light and unique.
The laksa risottos was excellent. Ambience and service was good too.
5
As the title suggests, the food served at Upper Place was really good. Service was attentive too. However we wished the portion size could be a tad more generous.
5
Saw this place on a blog recently and we decided to try their set lunch!
I think everything was great, service was impeccable. Lunch set was $24 and their wine bottles were 50% off.
The best ala carte item was laksa risotto. So yummy!
4
good choice if you are staying at the hotel Wangz of which this restaurant is a part (it's on the roof)
5
A cosy place with great view, affordable fine dining food. The staff were attentive and warm during our visit. Will return again to try other stuff on the menu.

We only stayed overnight at Wangz Hotel so ate at the rooftop restaurant. We ate on the terrace outside with views of Singapore. The service was good d and prices fair. The food portions were not huge but suited us. The food was tasty and well presented. It was quiet the night we ate there so in some ways even better.

This restaurant is about savouring good flavours in small portions - and its not for those who are looking for a gastronomical experience which involves large volumes of food.Each item on their menu comes in two sizes - tapas and mains. Tapas size comes with approximately 3 servings - so if you order the Kueh Pie Tee, you will be receiving 3 pieces of Kueh Pie Tee. Mains are slightly larger - enough for 5 - 6 people to taste the food item.So, if going dainty and savouring each bite and flavour of everything presented to you is your idea of a meal - then this place is for you. We tried almost everything on their menu, and it was a delightful experience. Flavours are European/Asian fusion, but not overwhelming on either culture, great blend and layering of flavours for almost everything. Presentation is delicate and beautiful. Dishes I would highly recommend - Lobster Kueh Pie Tee, Laksa Risotto, Tuna Tataki, Chendol Crepe.The portions are really quite small, but they are priced in the 6 - 8 dollar range for tapas size. It enables you to try a very wide range of food, but it does still feel a little underwhelming, especially when its your first time there and you see the serving size for the first time. The taste does make up for it though
5
Ambient is great. Staffs are polite and attentive. We were instantly impressed by the food presentation even before we take our first bite. The food quality and taste also exceeded our expectation. We ordered Lobster kueh pie tee. Pork tacosScallop AssamBeef striploinChendolWe were extremely satisfied with overall Dinning experience. Will be going back for their Valentine Day dinner.

Great restaurant, worth the visit!! Dont be put off by the location!!!When we got there, we nearly turned around and left. So glad we stayed! 99% of times we will not visit restaurants in hotels, but the pictures and write up really tempted me to go and I was very glad we did!! The hotel it is situated is a new hip boutique hotel which is good, but does not attract any walk ins. The location is not easy, need to get a taxi. because it is a small hotel the restaurant is the all day dining restaurant, so the atmosphere and decor dont match the food standards. HOWEVER, the food was sensational! The chef is ex Joel Robuchon and is now out on his own. We did the tasting plate and we loved one of the dishes we asked for another plate of it. So many flavours, well seasoned, great presentation. Overall fantastic (and we have dined at many restaurants at all levels!!). We gave a lot of feedback to the wait staff (who were also very friendly and attentive) but not sure if that was passed on, as normally in this style of restaurant the chef would come out to meet the guests. These days people like the overall experience and would have finished it well had the chef made an appearance. It was very quiet, hardly anyone there. Again dont let this put you off!!! (Wine overpriced and too small a selection. They are just developing the wine menu I think (hope))

Having read a glowing review in the papers, our family speedily made reservations to try out their cooking. The Mushroom soup was low salt, and nicely flavourful; the slow cooked pork belly tacos tasted good and zesty, though a tad bit salty; the reconstructed Laksa risotto was very spicy, with lots of foam for impact, lots of mussels, rich n interesting; the short rib congee n veal sweetbreads had no balance, and was not fragrant nor tasty. Forget the Kueh Pie Tie( cold, too much yucky mango ) n desserts!Price of $200 for 3 persons is way too much for the relatively disappointing meal!
5
Been there a couple of times with my partner, the food at Upper place never fails to wow me each time im there - i love the food there especially the laksa risotto - beautifully executed.
truly a hidden gem!
5
Afforable 3 course menu for less than $30. The Taco is a super refreshing appetizer and the mushroom soup has a very earthy nice taste and it goes with my miso chicken.
5
Chef Gregory , has vision..the menu not large but all the dishes we had were outstanding ..The four course taster menu just perfect..Presentation of the dishes perfect..and the quality of the food could not be faulted..

Ate each day for breakfast included in the room price. European, Asian and English breakfast fare. Unlimited coffee, very friendly chef service for your eggs.
4
Food and service were good. Staff was competent and accommodating. Simple fare at fair prices. It was in our hotel and we had lunch there the day we arrived.

Impressive 76-seater establishment, helming Chef Gregory Lau with more than 16 years of experience working in top-notch restaurants and hotels.The Yellow Fin Tuna Tartare Tart (S$14.00) is my favourite - it's so creatively done and beautifully plated like a mini galaxy garden dish. Then there's caviar paired with savoury tobiko, truffle onions and tangy guacamole coulis - it is perfection! Good lunch spot for meetings or dinner dates. Other interesting starter - the lobster kueh pie tee with mango coriander and chilli crab is worth trying too. For mains, I prefer laksa risotto. This fusion dish serves scallop, lobster and shrimp in a laksa-infused risotto, topped with with coconut foam and sambal.... Yums!!And if you're a dessert lover, Upper Place serves amazing carrot cake

We were hotel guest and ate the free buffet breakfast here daily. Its a good buffet, but it does not have a large assortment of choices, but its very good. We also ate lunch here one day as well when we were not out touring and eating, We had the MidWings and Chix Curry which were very good. also had a Molten Lava dessert and a Iced Lemon Tea to drink which were all good. As Guest you get a 20% discount on the restaurant food. The thing I like most are the servers. They were excellent - very attentive, always pleasant, and knew our names
3
Food tastes not bad but the meal were served to us unexpectedly long, ard 25-30 mins when we are the only customer in the restaurant. When I checked with the only waitress, she said that is because some of the food were frozen and needs time to thaw. :
5
Went for the set lunch last Friday at Nectar and it was absoultely delicious! We loved the butternut squash soup, the grilled karubi plate (braised beef with cannellini beans and barley) and the apple crumble cheesecake. Compliments to the chef and attentive service staff. We got a special price of $15++ for the set as we work close by.
5
Had my birthday dinner celebration with 15 friends on 29th April. The 4 course set dinner is really yummy and reasonably priced at $28.80. Especially the Slow Braised Pork Belly is a must try. The savory taste of the sauce combine the sweetness from the corn is really made the lean pork belly taste so good. I want to thanks Nectar staffs like Wei Chee, Shiek, Ivy and Asrina for your warm and prompt service. I love you all. Benny

We stayed At the hotel Wang where the restaurang is situated. We went out in the neighbour area to found à restaurang but Both time We landed At Nectar because it gave the best value fot the money and the best tasted food.
5
All the usual suspects were available for breakfast. I chose the asian options, which were delicious, and the selection of cured fish and goats cheese was top shelf.
5
Great Nonya food at reasonable price. Nice, cosy ambience and good service.
Set dinner @$28.80pax come with salad appetizer , main course (chicken or seafood or fish ) , tea or coffee and cake or ice cream dessert
4
The food at Nectar Restaurant is limited in variety but tasty and reasonably priced. The Staff here as everywhere in the Wangz Restaurant are very friendly and obliging.
4
The staff are very friendly and food is fresh and very nice. As it is a small restaurant the service is excellent and prompt.
5
Don't be put off by the location of the restaurant at the hotel lobby - the service is very attentive, the food is excellent and you even get a good discount if staying at the Wangz hotel (which is also recommended).
5
The best cocktails we have ever had. Expensive but worth it if you want something different. The mock tails are also great.
5
We went to the Nectar Restaurant every night before going out.
The Prawns were out of this world , drinks were well priced.
The live music in the background was a nice touch.
They should stay open longer.

After reading the reviews on TripAdvisor, we decided to give this place a go. Just a few minutes walk from our accommodation, we arrived to find the restaurant pretty much in the lobby of the Wangz Hotel. It's small and there were only two other people dining when we came in. We were immediately greeted by the cheerful Diane. She was so great, helping us decide on dinner and drinks and making conversation with us. She was always checking to make sure everything was ok. We ordered the set menu which consisted of a salad, soup and main and tea/coffee. We were also surprised by desert at the end of the night, which added to our enjoyment of the whole experience. Of course the food was delicious. We couldn't fault one thing. Overall, we had an excellent night and would recommend this restaurant to everyone.

This Resturant is really a Gem in Singapore city in Wangz hotel at 231 Outram Rd. It serve fusion cuisine mostly Italian and western. You must try their Rib eyes and lamb shank, they are really good. I had tried their smoked duck, salmon and they are yummy too. This Resturant is tastefully decorated by expensive art pieces which create a very classy yet warm ambience. The staffs are well trained. The manager Ivy was really thoughtful to welcome us and bring us around. We felt like a VIP. I must mention Dianne who is attentive, cheerful and warm when she serve the customers. Wei Chee is efficient, courteous and polite. . If you are around Outram area you must try.
