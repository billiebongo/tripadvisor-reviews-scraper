Came here for a coffee after lunch today. The coffee was decent but service was quite slow, even though there were very few people in the cafe. Ambience is good and staff are friendly. But a little more organisation is definitely needed.

Truly great brunch. The pancakes and French are food art...that taste incredible. Price is very reasonable and service is excellent.

We came here in April 2017 and the service and food was amazing!! So on our second visit to Singapore we didn't think twice about heading back. This time being seated was very slow. Cafe was quiet but staff were busy chatting instead of tending to customers. I ordered the gauc smash, which last time was a decent size serve, lots of ago and beetroot and feta. This time a bit disappointing. Very watery eggs, little gauc, about 1/2 a tsp of feta (not exagerating) food was still yummy. But not amazing like it once was. New owners perhaps? On the other hand, my husband had the French toast and they definitely put alot of effort into that dish! That one looked and tasted awesome

The Team should perhaps learn how to run a cafe and segregation of roles before actually running it. Especially in anticipating crowds. I would understand that food can take slightly longer on a busy day but to wait for an hour for coffee is unacceptable. I literally went down, checked their order queue and took my own coffee because they clearly have no clue what they are doing. To add, I've ordered a seafood aglio olio. Not el dente aside, what was described in the menu as "pasta with prawns and clams" should perhaps be replaced with "clams shells". All in all, I would not come back nor recommend anyone to come as we have dozens of better cafes in Singapore.

So me and my friend excitedly headed to this place after seen photos on TripAdvisor and everything looked amazing!The interior was great and they served soy milk so I can finally had a milky coffee!!However, when going to order food I was told that they do not cater to gluten free people! Even though they had tuna salad and also A quinoa salad.. which both are gluten free but they told me that nothing on their menu was gluten free, even when I seen the waitress going to the chef!!Safe to say i was highly disappointedIf your not gluten free, the food looks and sounds amazing.

The food were all amazing, big serving though it took a while for the food to get served, but it was all worth the wait. The place itself was not big so be prepared to wait to get a table (we had to share a table with a couple but that's fine with us). The outdoor seats can be a little warm but there are huge fans to help the air ventilation. I'd definitely visit again for the great food. Ps, they don't do reservation

Stopped off here for breakfast in July - I was just passing and it looked lovely - nice vibe. They had a good menu of brunch choices - I had the avo smash which was really delicious. I got the impression the place was only recently opened - nobody explained the ordering process and my coffee arrived long after I had finished my breakfast.But all the food that came out looked amazing - and the coffee was good!They also have Wi-Fi

overall i'd say we still had a good experience at Botanist. It was a really hot day and we chose the sit indoors at first, but the food smell was really strong so we decided to move outside. There were air coolers/air-conditioners but i don't know why they were not switched on despite the weather being so hot. was definitely sweating while eating :(The french toast was really good and i would recommend it to anyone coming here for the first time, but share it! can get quite filling after a while. We also ordered the chicken quinoa salad which was all great till we found a slug in it... of course, they immediately apologized and made a new one for us. The staff were also nice enough to not charge us for the ice coffee we had as an apology for what happened. Not sure if i would come back in the afternoon just because of the bad seating arrangements though

Great looking place, great looking food. Basically, instagrammable. I really do love the place but I had to choose between sitting indoors where I would end up smelling like food due to the semi open kitchen, or sitting outdoors where if it rained and the tent was pulled out, it would be so so so warm and humid with insufficient ventilation. The food was alright but I expected a corned beef hash when I ordered a corned beef hash. It was pulled beef instead. Huge difference. Would go again if I need to update my Instagram account. Lol.

We were staying at a hotel just around the corner but the breakfast wasn't very good so we ventured out in search of a cafe. We were actually looking for a taxi stand when we saw a sign pointing us in the direction of this funky cafe in a side street. The staff were very friendly, the coffee was delicious and service was fairly quick. I had the gauc smash and it was amazing!! Generous portions for the price. I would happily go back next time I'm in singapor
