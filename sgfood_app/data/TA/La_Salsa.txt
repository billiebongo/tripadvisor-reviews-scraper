Went there with the family...overpriced, Carnitas very dry, no taste in the buritos or Taco's. For what they charge there are better options although we havent yet found a great Mexican in SG, just some a little above average.

One of the best Mexican food in Singapore. Beef Fajitas were awesome! However, the location is a little inconvenient for those without their own cars, as public transport is further down the road. Staff was super friendly and helpful! :)
4
Around 11pm, we joined the La Salsa for after dinner drinks. We had cocktails and all were well done like it should be. Prices also fair
They have live music every saturday and the band was superb playing great classics and other gems!

Ordered via Foodpanda - portion size was minuscule and after one bight each my wife and both agreed that the luke. warm slop in front of us was inedible and even not of a standard we would feed to our dog - complaint sent to FP also

This place was a total train wreck. Cold queso from a jar. Grotty guacamole. No service. An awful acoustic covers of 00's pop songs CD. Truely our worst dining experience in Singapore to date. We left before the mains arrived. Staff didn't bat an eyelid. I think the only redeeming feature is we did quite like the light shades.

I am not a Mexican food expert but food here tasted authentic and was delicious. The Nacho was one of the best I had tried - the chips were light and came with right balance of cream, cheese, beans and guacamole. The steak of our burito was served sizzling and aromatic. Crab cake was moist and flavorful. The lime Margarita was good but but was quite excessive at S$80 per jar. Service was slow and a little overwhelmed by the Saturday crowd. Live music performance started at 10pm (every Fri, Sat and Sun) and it lighted up the house. I will come back again for fun and casual dinning
5
This in my opinion is the most authentic tasting Mexican food in Singapore. Having lived here for 27yrs and a confessed Mexican food addict, I have tried every one that has opened in Singapore. Many have come and gone and most have been rather disappointing except for La Salsa
5
Good place to chill. Food is excellent and service is good. They have a live band on Saturdays and there are outdoor sittings if you don't want to be close to the band. Music is good not too loud and selections of songs are good. We had borrittos nachos crab cakes etc plus jugs of sangria n a beer tower. I will recommend this place to all who wants some good food and musi
4
One of the best maxican food places in Singapore, I like the live music offer here. Service can be improved as but slow and not too friendly, but somedays it's been great on service attitude. Will go again and again as food for the price can put up with service gap as it not too bad
3
The food is quite good, and the service average, but the serving time, and already the time to get the menu and place the order took very long.There was simple no attention at all, and not just on our table. Self service would work surely much faster and efficient.Corn chips and dip (appetizer) served one minute after the main course about an hour after ordering.They could surely do better up ther
3
Went on a Sunday for lunch. The whole place was empty. A group of 7 adult, 6 kids. Food portion was small. Taste was only average for the price you pay. Nothing much else to say.
5
Food and service were great. Beer is fab and not too expensive as Singapore goes. Eaten here 4 times now and is one of our favourites.
3
Enjoyed the food more than i expected-- especially the carnitas... Service very average as was ambiance
4
An unplanned visit turned out to be a wonderful experience! Great food, and Morgan entertained us with his soulful singing!! Staff were attentive.. Thank you!!
5
good place to have mexican food . Have good veg options and serves good mocktales.
Tasty food and decent palce to hang out with family & friends
3
I read good reviews about this place from blogs and we decided to go there to celebrate our anniversary. The ambiance was nice, but we felt that the food was average. We ordered the hot plate with chicken and prawn which costs $35. We were expecting a big serving of prawns and chicken, but there were only 2 to 3 small prawns. The burrito was better in terms of taste and value for money. In general the portions are small, which is unusual for a mexican restaurant. I would not come back for the food, but it is a decent place with nice service
3
service was quite good and friendly.food was average - nothing fancy - Beef Burrito - big portions but not really a mexican taste a lot of sour cream and too much minced meat.Starters are well prepared and tasty - the Guacamole was also nice.Beer selection - good - served cold as expected.In all some positive aspects but for the price (higher range) quite a lot to improve on presentation and preparation
4
We were late for dinner..10.00pm, and most of the places on Dumpy Hill refused us a meal, till we went to La Salsa, and were surprised by their warmth. We ordered our meal, and it was excellent food. I would definitely go there again for Mexican food
1
This is exactly what you worry a Mexican restaurant in Asia will be - inauthentic and plain awful. And there's no excuse because there are actually good Mexican restaurants in Singapore - check my other reviews.I went with DH and 2 DS's. We each ordered something mainstream and easy - nothing weird. We assumed that since it's in Dempsey Hill and there's so much good food there, this must also be good. Don't make that assumption. Maybe this is the exception that proves the rule? None of the food was good. The tomatoes were barely pink - and they were in their box just outside the restroom - yuk. I know what's in the markets! If I can buy ripe tomatoes so can they. Their dishes rely on copious amounts of guacamole and sour cream to please the palate. The portions were huge. But the taste was so bad we didn't even want to take the leftovers home
5
When on holiday in Singapore this is the place we go. La Salsa at Dempsey Hill is easy to find. We took the bus, not far to walk but hot walking up the hill. Lovely friendly staff, great food. a superb margarita and although we ate outside we could hear live music inside and look for special offers on the drinks. Thanks for a great evening. See you next year
5
Yoooo I may still be tipsy but I have to say the best Lime Margharita I have ever had. There is a secret ingredient that the bartender let me see! So stoked and the guacamole & salsa isn't bad either yummy
3
Unlike other reviews the service we experienced was very efficient. The food quality was fairly average. The veg burrito was rather dry with hardly any vegetables. The beef chimichanga on the other was moist and well cooked.
1
Non existent service, forgotten orders, food delays, unknowledgeable staff, food just ok.
not worth the money spent.
3
Our food came but they never gave us any Cutlery. The drinks was at the bar for more than 15 mins. To be fair there was only 3 of them. The young lady waitress was good. Indian crew has a ready smile. Chinese waiter was grumpy. Lady in white trying to save the day. And the 1 man band singing late 70s America and John Denver was smashing. The cactus salad was ok. I wasn't sure what dressing was used. The salsa was over blended. They should hand cut/ chop more for those prices. Blending kills the freshness so quickly. The ribeye was undercook for the wife. We sent back was returned in medium which was good even though the medium rare was a little too rare for her. Broccoli was over cooked. The rest were good. Seeing how the lady boss tries hard,'I'll try it again but not so soon.
4
Excellent Mexican food, great service great vibe. This is one to try great venue on Dempsey Hill with a great menu and many options to chose from. Great service and a very nice venue with indoor and outdoor seating. Give it a try if you love your Mexican food. Enjoy
5
What a brilliant find! Service was impeccable, even noting that drinks were low (not finished) and asking if we wanted refills. Food was delicious - myself & hubby opted for crab cakes to start and they were very tasty indeed. I had a chicken chimichanga and my husband the chicken enchiladas - both were, again, very tasty. After the crab cakes tho' I struggled to finish mine as it was a very generous portion size. The kids both had tacos and the kitchen accommodated their fussy tastes by delivering plain (no garnishes) as requested. The kids had ice cream for afters - we had no space left. Overall a great find and one I will definitely be returning too.
4
Went for a quite dinner with wife to La Salsa and was wonderfully surprised with the good food. The hostess was extremely helpful with suggestions, which we were glad to accept. They have live band playing through the evening. The food as well as the ambiance was good
4
This was my second visit and I can say that I still think it's a great version of Mexico in Asia. Had the chimichanga this time and it had an interesting mole sauce inside. My favorite app is the queso fundido. Looks disgusting but is surprisingly fantastic. Fried mozzarella in a green sauce served with chips. Awesome! Also, we ordered chicken nachos which were pretty good. Not cheap but still great Mexican in Asia
4
My friend took me there when i visited Singapore and it was a great time. Service was crowded but i can't complain because they really tried the best taking care of the guest. The chops i had was so juicy and tasty. My mouth still dripping when i think of it. Worth a night.
1
The food here was OK - nothinh smazing but tasty. Price was also ok for singapore. However, the service was truly terrible: inefficient, inattentive and unresponsive to feedback. It took 30 mins to take our order, 25 mins to clear our starter plates and another 20 to clear our main course plates and this was only done when we asked. As a eesukt if this we waited 40 mins betweeb stsrters abd mains on a vwry quiet sunday afternoon. We had to flag waiters down to order more drinks. The waitress taking care of our table spent most of the afternoon on her phone in plain sight of customers who needed attention and was extremely surly. When we asked the shift supervisor to pay more attention to our table he did nothing and barely responded to our feedback at the end of the meal - there was certainly no apology!It's also not family friendly as there isn't a single changing table in the entire restaurant despite there being lots of space in the disabled bathroom.
4
Food is great! service is great! ambience is ok! But a value for money place.. as fr as food is concerned...
4
The food was great, the location was great, good service and the ambience was also great. What else do you need in a restaurant?
Overall, great experience. A bit expensive though, so go there only if you can afford it :-)
4
I haven't found many Mexican sttle restaurants in Singapore, but this one will do just fine. The fiid is good, atmosphere is really nice, and the drinks were good. Wait staff was good but not over the top. Otherwise a really giod spot.
4
Always go back to this restaurant when I visit Singapore. It has a live band on weekends and food is good too! Service is great and they make you feel comfortable !
4
If you love Mexican food with live music and Main reason to enjoy a delicious Mexican meal This is a great place. Located at Dempsey hills gives you that feeling of in a country side. Restaurant space and service attitude is the only negative . Looking around 40Sin$/person if you go with 2 or 3 for a starter to share, drink and a main dish. Economical and better food than other Mexican restaurant located at Dempsey hills. Highly recommend to go as got a good men
5
Super nice easy going place! Usha really does add something special to the service and ambiance of the place! Enjoyed the food and drink so much I almost forgot to mention how truly yummylicious it all was! Probably one of best Mexican dinners I have had! Food super yummy.. And a very inventive list of magaritas!!!Yes it is a little pricey.. But then again what isn't in Singapore! But for good food, drink and ambiance.. I feel it's worth every penny! Will be back Definitely a must try !!!! Splurge a little ... After all it's cheaper than flying to Mexico for great fajitas!:
5
Enjoyed their Quesiadillas, chimmychanga, fajitas and was introduced to new dishes by the Mexican cook. Live band 'Inner City' was also very entertaining with a wide repertoire of several music genres, especially funk and soul. Service was very friendly and knowledgeable in explaining the dishes!Totally entertaining evening with family and friends. Had the classic magaritta while my friend raved about the red sangria
4
Last time we were in Singapore we ate here and we visited once again this year. We relaxed with cold beers outside whilst ordering from the varied menu. The waitress let us know our meal and our table were ready inside, where there was live music, ethnic dÃ©cor and a lovely atmosphere. Our choice of Mexican food was plentiful and delicious. OK drinks are expensive in Singapore so I thought I might just as well have a margarita and it was perfect. Great evening. Thanks
3
As a Mexican I would say that they tried so hard, it is just a little disappointing the the carnitas are over fried, shredded and really dry, The place looks Mexican but they just play pop music and they don't got confused thinking that "desperados" beer was from Mexico ... My lesson, I will try local food and have Mexican food when I visit Mexico
4
Finding good mexican in Singapore can be tough.. not so tough when living in the US. this is an upscale Mexican place.. grad margaritas was good, so were the sangria.. starters got us to whet the appetite for the main course. service was good. place was slow for a Friday.. music was great. Morgan was great on the strings... music was great.. Morgan took a song request and did all wonders. all in all a lovely evening.. and perfect for a lovely dinner.
4
The food had a good mexican taste and we enjoyed it. Staff was ok. to. In the la salsa resaraunt, they had beautifull deco.
They also had a life band and while eating you could enjoy the meal with the music
4
Quiet but enough people to give an atmosphere. We found the serving staff nothing but friendly and helpful. Especially with the little ones. Enjoyed the live music and the food was great, but not quite excellent. Thumbs up!
4
In La Salsa they serve authentic Mexican food such as fajitas, enschelades and much more. We loved the food and atmosphere. The service is ok but not very pro-active and going the extra mile. All in all good alternative in Demsey Hill.
4
We had a good meal here. Nice Mexican food but drinks are expensive. There were musicians playing in the background which created a good atmosphere.
3
Ordered drinks beer shandy was one of them came with soda water not lemonade, waiter was reluctant to change, in the end ordered glass of lemonade and a beer, think they had to get lemonade from another source, took 20 minutes to get lemonade.
4
A must go for all the mexican food lovers. Great variety for vegetarians. Staff is quite friendly and the live music just hypes the mood!
Usually crowded on weekends so better book beforehand if you want to grab a place inside to enjoy the music.
4
La Salsa is probably one of favourite places to eat in Singapore. The food there is actually perfect! Even for vegetarians, there is ample choice. We have only ever had one bad experience when the guacamole wasn't very great because the avocados were bad. Other than that, the service and food quality is brilliant! You can go there to hang out with your friends or even just go for a night out with your family
3
I had been here with in a group of eight to bid farewell to one of the couples two weeks ago on a Sunday night at Dempsey. I must say the service was below par and the staff was not attentive - this is unpardonable when late on a Sunday evening with hardly any crowd. However the ambience was fantastic and made for the poor service. The food was average-nothing to write home about.
4
On arrival we thought the restaurant was a bit quiet and it remained so. However we were treated to great Mexican food, excellent service and live music. The evening was most enjoyable and the only thing lacking was people so get down there and boost this places popularity.
3
Not on crowded Friday evening on Dempsey Hill we decided to Mexican at La Salsa. The starters we ordered came in promptly . The mains just didn't seem to come and when it came just the tortilla bread with salads, we were just waiting for the chicken. Finally after telling the staff that the chicken was not served they went around hunting for our main dish. It seems that it had landed on another table diagonally opposite which promptly made its journey back to our table via the kitchen. The bungling of orders didn't end there as our second round of drinks was served incorrectly too. The food was good but the poor service ruined the evening. The sad fact was the restaurant seem to be famous for this based on the reviews above
2
The food here was very average and expensive.
The taco's I make better myself, nobody at our table finished their meal due to not enjoying the food.
We observed another table of diners leave before they finished their meals also.
5
The food here and its drinks are very nice. The ambiance was great because of the live band here. The staffs were all very nice as well.
4
We, a family of 6 adults and 2 kids dined here on a friday evening. They bought a baby chair to the table without us asking and promptly brought the menus to us. The food arrived in excellent time and some of the items that stood out were - nachos classico, chimichanga and the hot and spicy salsa. We were served by 3 different serves, and they were all very helpful, warm and efficient. Nice and crispy churros rounded off a delicious evening. The live music was awesome. They weren't very crowded for a fri evening but, I guess, dec is a slow month for most restaurants. Highly recommend this gem

We usually go to Marguerites at Dempsey Hill for Mexican Food but decided to try something else for a change... and ended up with their neighbour's, a relatively new addition to Dempsey Hill. The vibe/atmosphere in the restaurant is quite similar and prices are comparable. However we enjoyed the food more at La Salsa, perhaps because some of the dishes we samples tasted more authentic. As a main course we had the Empenadas with Oaxacan mole which tasted pretty much as I remember the mole from the actual Oaxaca. Usually mole is a little on the heavy/filling side for me but this one actually combined nicely with the other tastes without overpowering it. The sweetness of the chocolate percolated through just a bit, just enough really. My partner had the shredded pork which combined with salsa and a tortilla was equally tasty in a surprising authentic and flavoursome way. Service is efficient and cordial. The only thing that could use some improvement is the frozen margueritas which were on the light side and which, quite simply put, the neighbours do a better job at. Later in the evening a singer took the stage and played some nice, quiet Mexican songs. A nice addition and fortunately not one which disrupted our conversation too much
5
I only eat Mexican because my children like it!This was an excellent experience. Based on other reviews we did not take the prawns and luckily the owner/manager was not there but service from Rosie was really excellent, attentive and quick, food outstanding, Atmosphere great and good beer on tap.We will be back many times...,
5
Went to La Salsa twice while I was in Singapore visiting friends. The margaritas were the best ever (they rival Texas margaritas!). The food was great, it was real Mexican flavors & choices. The nights we were there they had a guy singing & he was wonderful to listen to, but not so loud that you could not enjoy conversation with your friends! Go to La Salsa! You will not be disappointed
4
We have eaten a lot of Mexian food in Singapore and never found one that actually served Mexican food. This place does. Mostly, Singaporean don't like spicy food so most places really tone down the peppers and seasonigs. I found the flavorings here acceptable but i did have to order some Jalpeno peppers - that is normal for me even in Mexico. The Margaritas were of excellent quality but again - too expensive. $30 plus plus for a drink is too much. The salsa was tasty and came quickly with chips. This is the first Mexican resaurant i have ever eaten at where the dinners did not include beans and rice... that is weird. It is almost free and is certainly part of every meal in Mexico... if you want to be authentic you have to serve it.Overall, good. Atmosphere is very nice... the music is excellent and enjoyable
3
We found the prices of the drinks to be quite high. The food was ok .The pork dishes were really oily. The staff seemed a bit lost and did not seem to know what the items on the menu.There a a few vegetarian options as well
4
Nice bar and restaurant with one of the best local musician V.Mogan performing .The beers were reasonable anyway most of the pubs of this standard cost more or less the same.Nice tapas mushrooms I had with my beer.Will keep going back for only one reason the soloist band V.Mogan. Keep it up Morgan.By the way the bartander was a friendly guy . Recommended.

We are expats living in Singapore the last few months, having moved here from a region of the US known for many restaurant options for those seeking "authentic Mexican" cuisine. Since we haven't had Mexican food for several months, last Friday evening my wife and I decided to try La Salsa on Dempsey Rd. There is actually a second restaurant in the same general area serving similar cuisine, but we liked the look of this more intimate setting (plus they had a very good musician entertaining the diners when we arrived.) The menu offers a lot of different choices, enough so that if you are a fan of Mexican food you should be able to find your favorite dish somewhere on the menu. The service we experienced, however, left a lot to be desired. The first waitress who showed up at our table could not understand our entree order (even when showing her the menu and pointing at the dishes!) so she handed the duties off to another waiter. During the course of our time there, we were served by at least 4 different waiters/waitresses...a "team effort" but no one seemed to really know how to take care of a table of two people. Drink orders took a long time (we were mere feet from the bar; perhaps we could have had better service just going to the bar ourselves?) Our entrees were of average quality, and in one instance (a dish supposed to contain chicken) I am pretty certain the meat used was beef. The next time we are on Dempsey we may try the other restaurant I mentioned at the outset so we can compare it to La Salsa
4
It is the place to go for great Mexican food. I love the chicken burritos and prawn fajitas. Reasonable price. Staff was very attentive. Service was efficient. Truly enjoyed my dinner that was accompanied with live music.
5
Great live music, great food. Celebrated my friend's b'day last night and everyone had a good time.
Too little truffle oil in the truffle fries.. but other than that, our other sides and mains were good.
2
It took ages to get the food once ordered. We ordered one entre which came after the mains. Food was ok but not worth the money we paid.
5
Dempsey is a great location, secluded and green. La Salsa offers great mexican food, cooked the way the mexicans do, and slightly tempered to suit the Asian palate. A must try for anyone who likes mexican cuisine.
3
Excellent Rita's. Recommend for a visit. Fajitas were over spiced hot but that's okay with me but not truly Mexican. Will go back .
4
Beautiful decor and surroundings..the music complimented the vibe. Hands down a must when in Singapore
2
What a terrible night it was! We were perhaps assigned to a trainee waiter who was simply terrible. from forgetting the order to mixing up drinks, he was just a classic case of an employee ruining what could have been an amazing evening. He even mixed up water with vodka, something we discovered when our 6 year old decided to take a sip of water and realised she had had her first brush with alcohol. The food is very good and the portions are quite large. The live singer is really good and keeps the place going till the wee hours. However, the service was so bad that we wanted to leave mid-way. It took about 20 minutes to get a basket of nachos. The drinks never came till we went to the bar and insisted on grabbing our glasses ourselves. The dishes were mixed up. We got what we had not ordered and what we had ordered was lost in the kitchen at the back. We eventually did get our waiter replaced and the new one was great. However, I would not risk going here unless they assigned an experienced waiter
3
Watched the sun go down with a beer. We would have had more but the service was a little slow. We moved inside and we shared Chicken and Prawn Fajitas. Not exciting but very nice. Great atmosphere due to guy with guitar singing old favourites like Mr Bo Jangles. Finished the evening with another beer outside and we would have had margaritas but the waiter had disappeared
3
Nice place to go if you're looking for good Mexican food in Singapore. They have a good variety, including many options for vegetarians. Ambience is also good, but service is poor. I ordered 3 items, but they got only 2 items. Only when I told them to bring the cheque did they remember, and got the 3rd item
4
We all enjoyed the meal and the margarita was good. I loved the salsa so much that I ate it by the spoonful after I ran out of chips. The restaurant is in the popular Dempsey Hill location. The atmosphere is nice and the menu varied
4
Decent variety and good taste. A bit of live music to liven the scene. Fairly authentic and reliable service. Worth a visit.
4
Everything we ordered was good. Service was lacking as usual. Prices were high, but portions were good size. Atmosphere was good though...there is a one man band who is pretty good. Will probably go back for appetizers and drinks.
4
Love this Mexican restaurant. Generous portions and very tasty. Service is a bit slow but very friendly. Highly recommended and far far better than the rival margaritas which has poor food and is overpriced.
4
Hi Foodies,For those who have been to Dempsey Hill , I need not tell them about the locality, here the old ware houses have been converted into Restaurants , its a beautiful place with lots of option Japanese, Indian , Mexican, Italian and off course the Chinese Sea Food ones. These restaurants are a bit high end but definately worth a try.La Salsa can be easily spotted here, as you enter you have a Bar on the left and seats on the right , the traditional Mexican Decor adds to live music which is pretty soothing. High roof and cozy lighting is an add on. We tried the vegetarian good and mock tails, I was impressed with the Veg Options they have , quite a lot. The Tacos were just awesome and the other dishes were at par . The serve was surprisingly fast when the occupancy was around 80%. We throughly enjoyed the evening. Over all a must try
4
Singapore is developing a surprising taste for Mexican food, with several new eateries (El Rocho, Baja Fresh, etc) opening up in the last year alone. The Dempsey Road area alone has three Mexican joints now. Despite the competition, La Salsa remains one of the best. I have tried the chicken chimichanga on the last three trips, and despite some inconsistency each time, it is one of the best chimichangas you can have in Singapore. Try to go at lunch time when the ambience is a bit more relaxed and the loud, live band is not playing
4
Have been to this restaurant many times and will gladly go back. I find this place great for a snack and drinks. The main courses I have ordered were quite uneventful on the weekends and disappointing on the weekdays. The appetizers are great, however, and strawberry frozen margaritas are excellent, if you like strawberry margaritas. The singer is absolutely fabulous, making the atmosphere wonderful. The service is friendly and efficient. If the quality of the cooking is improved, the place will become a true gem
3
So if your looking for Tex-Mex, this is not the place for you. This is more of Mexican style food, little flavor and not a lot of imagination. Place is small, but there is out door seating If you want to stop and have a drink. Margaritas are too sweet for my taste, but if that is what you like, this place is for you. Food was higher priced than other Mexican Restaurants in the area and not as flavorful. Portions are a good size, not too much and not too small. Service was not very accommodating, waiter was not able to offer us a taste of the margaritas before we tried it, he kept telling us it was good. Well before I spend 95.00 Sing on a pitcher, I want to know if I like it first. Would not accommodate us. Their loss, my husband ordered one and did not even drink 1/2 of it. There are too many other restaurants in Dempsy, especially Mexican Restaurants that are a bit better that I would not try this one again
2
My husband and I now live here in Singapore. We went to Dempsey Hill and wandered around the dozens of restaurants and decided on La Salsa. We ordered, chips and salsa with Guacamole. The Salsa was fermented and the guacamole was the consistency of the stuff that comes in plastic tubes We then had the nachos with chicken, not good! The cheese was oily and about a 1/2 inch thick and the chicken, well...I will never know what it actually was. We had a chicken quesidilla, again way too much cheese and weird chicken. Lastly I had a Sea Bass fajita and my husband had a ground beef chimichanga. The "Sea Bass" was NOT Sea Bass. It was a very very thin piece of fish that could have been tilapia that was obviously frozen and my husbands chimichanga looked and tasted like it was filled with left over scraps from all the patrons the night before. There was a live guitarist who sang his own lyrics to classic American songs, and at one point our waitress got up there and sang too.I wont be returning
3
Nice place good food but nothing spectacular . Enough choices but all standard Mexican dishes. We ordered for a salad (16),tacos with chicken (around 20) and a main course for 26. They serve hearty portions and the ambience is nice. They have a band playing in the nights on weekend
2
Decent Mexican grub is admittedly hard to come by but La Salsa fails pretty badly truth be told. Unfortunately like so many other outlets at Dempsey, La Salsa fails with the initial promises of style not backed up by any substance. La Salsa didn't deliver on the style either however.We found the food badly presented and bland and the service was at best a little grudging. There was also the slightly strange live music performance from a band that was offering little in the way of 'Mexican ambience' playing strange down tempo versions of tracks from 'The Graduate'.Bathrooms are frequently a grumble for us in this town also and having only one bathroom each for gents and females is terribly insufficient for a restaurant of this size. It is also especially frustrating when you wait over 5 minutes to use the facilities only for a member of staff to emerge.Overall a pretty mediocre experience and we shan't be going back I'm afraid
