Serves one of the most yummiest yogurts in the city. This place has a wide variety of deserts and sure is a treat for people with sweet tooth.

A small shop at the corner of a old flat. You might even walk pass it everyday. Waffles are good and so is the coffee, at half the price of those big coffee chains. Hidden gem :)

love their pistachio gelato aka 'Shy green nut' and dark chocolate gelato aka 'choc-a-baby'. Reasonably priced. Just wish the wait for waffles could be faster.

A unique place at east residential area of singapore. The flavours are great and the menu is too. Quite and relaxing place at night to spend a lil romantic or family fun time with loved ones. Not expensive and not nature beauty all. Just a simple walk to cafe and relax with their ice cream and have a chat place

First discovered this place while doing some errands. Proud to say that I'm one of the few customers to frequent there as soon as it opens its first outlet in Bedok. As it is located a few blocks away from my residences, I always frequent MHG. Gelato are really great-tasting and innovative. Gelato are done by themselves and there are so many nice flavours to choose from.Absolutely love the cookie monster and salty malty flavoured gelato! Quaffles are great too! There's also a buddy meal for those who comes in pairs. It consist of 2 scoops of gelato, a quaffle and a cup of lemonade this is around less than $15. However, sometime there would be quite a wait to get the order due to the big quantity of customers there. They also do sell takeaways for the gelato. Gelato will be packed in a bag and it can last for around 2 hours (?) without melting. Small seating area outside the shop for customers. However it may get quite hot and humid around afternoon, while during dinner time it can get quite packed.Staffs are friendly too! Heard there's a new flavour therefore will be going down there for more! Definitely miss the cookie monster gelato! Despite the long wait for quaffles, the gelato is worth the wait. Lowest price for gelato: $2.8

The branch at Bedok is small and narrow and has limited seating. They do not have the space to serve weekend brunch items such as eggs Benedict, as the branch at Bukit Batok can.However, the waffles here are very good - crispy, tasty and not too heavy. We went for the buddy meal at $11.50 (actual price was $14.30, with taxes and a premium ice cream - creamier, or so the staff said). The two flavours we had - Shy green nut and milk and honey - were not too sweet and the scoops were quite generous. The shy nut was a little odd, I felt, with its little bits of chocolate. I also tried the salted caramel, but it was really salty.They are located next to Choc-a-bloc, which sells cakes, so if you are in the mood for a gelato or cake, do try them out

First off they make a mean waffle. Crisp on the outside but absolutely fluffy on the inside, M&H’s waffles are probably the best I’ve had in Singapore. And the best way to enjoy them is through the Buddy Meal ($9) - includes of 2 scoops of gelato, a waffle, and a lemonade - mopping up the goodness of the accompanying melted gelato.The Salty Malty stole my heart and made me an ultimate salty-sweet fanatic. Absolute delight. Eat it with the Balsamic Strawberry for an interesting take on strawberry cheesecake.While their gelatos are undoubtedly amazing, what truly makes M&H shine is the wonderful people behind it. The bosses have always been very welcoming, and the staff never fail to greet us with a smile. Every past visit Clarence, one of the bosses, would personally bring our waffles to us, listen to feedback on his products, and humbly accepting them. It’s this interaction and care for their customers that really makes M&H a joy to visit.For photos and the full review, head over here: http://www.chocolat-et-basil.com/#!Milk-and-Honey-Gelato/cmbz/353109D0-EE7E-4849-9B09-146C365E01A
