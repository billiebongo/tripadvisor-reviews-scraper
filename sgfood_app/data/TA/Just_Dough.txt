The bun tastes good and soft, the filling is also very generous. I tried the yam paste. It was thick and smooth. Good

Tried the bun from this stall at Suntec (around the Fountain of Wealth). The buns are really delicious and also reasonably priced.

What attracted us at 1st was the colourful buns. It was really soft with good amount of fillings. Personal Preferences :- Cheesy Chicken for the salty taste- Yam for the sweet tasteHowever, we find the Chilli Crab Soup alittle weird. It is like diluting actual chilli crab sauce to make it into soup. The sweetness in the soup taste like sugar added into it, instead of natural sweetness from the crab. Overall, the bun taste soft and delicious.

Plain bun is known as mantou, typically seen and available in Coffeeshops. Surprised to see this flavourful creativity at work. Banana chocolate, durian, sesame, green tea etc. Flavours popular and goes well for Asians' taste bud. Had coffee and the green tea banana bun. Awesome bun. Asked to steam it and ate it warm. (; Coffee was bad. Staff were smiley and swift. Good experience.

We were attracted by the size and colours of the steam buns. Many varieties of flavours and fillings but can be a bit confusing if you're on the go.

It was generous in quantity. There were also plain ones (mantow

Visited this shop when shortly after its opening. Quite a wide selection of buns with unique combination of flavours and skins (eg. Pumpkin filling, charcoal bun skin). Best eaten on the spot when steamed hot - the buns which I gave away and were re-heated the next day was not as good in texture. Seating area is also quite spacious and located near the fountain of wealth.
