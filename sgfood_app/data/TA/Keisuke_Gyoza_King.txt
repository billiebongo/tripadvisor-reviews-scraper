Consistently good offerings, like both other Keisuke ramen outlets around Tanjong Pagar. Good for dining by oneself or with small groups.

Long queues are usually a recipe for great food. We waited 45 mins on a weekend eve in the queue and it was so worth it! We sat outdoors. Completely loved the set meal concept and the food. Will definitely go again!!

I had high expectation since it was highly rated for this gyoza specialist.Food taste is pleasant and nothing much to shout at . The lunch set I ate is been priced at 13.90 and it will be good to go on weekend to avoid the long q created by many office workers.I will not q for this restaurant and this is just a normal standard food serving.

No joking! This was the best gyoza experience we had so ever! We went in two days in a row!But it is not only the gyozas, the side dishes and the free pickle salads starters were amazing. What about the staff! So friendly, the Manager San was making the best to all the customers when we were there . And to finalize, they have a very nice and cold Sapporo beer to match the dinner!

Excellent choice! MyHusband and I are gyoza lovers and coming here was perfect and our meal was so satisfying. The set meal is $S$13.90 for one side meal and choice of rice, soup and Two side dishes. Drink is separately priced. The gyozas was extremely delicious and fresh! Complimentary seasoned bean sprouts and Japanese pickles are available to patrons and you can eat your hearts out! We left the place happy as a clam! Besides the delicious food, the service was great! The staff were extremely friendly and attentive. Because we came after the lunch crowd left, we were so well taken care off! Uncle saw me devoured the miso soup that he topped it up! Tip: Avoid lunch hours so you can enjoy the food! But note last order is at 1430.

We went here on the recommendation of our resident relatives. At first I was a bit dubious about the place as we had to wait outside for thirty minutes to get a seat but I needn’t have been. The portions were very generous and the food was exceptional. I almost think the side dishes were better than the actual gyozas!! Loved it so much we went twice. Absolute must for anyone visiting Singapore. Wish I was there right now

A great lunch choice for when you're particularly hungry, the gyoza and the side dishes are all pretty good. I like to go with a friend and get different types of gyoza and small dishes to share! You can take away but better to eat there, if not the gyoza will be sticky and lose taste when cold

Always wondered why there were queues outside and today i found out why. Only 2 people in front so we queued up too and ten minutes later we were in.A simple basic place with a model that works, i.e. standard menu which is quick to serve so the turnover is fast.We were there for 25 minutes max and had the standard menu. The soup was thick and noodles good. Boiled eggs on the table make a nice addition to the soup. Will definitely be back.

So.. I am here again as part of Keisuke challenge!If you haven't been here, the order works like 1. Pick your gyoza (pork/chicken/prawn) 2. Choose 2 sides from chicken karage or fried prawn or white fish or vegetables The gyoza itself, to me... tastes like those frozen Japanese gyoza but the sides and other foods served combined is what you pay for. They serve pasteurised eggs, you can top up the rice, water, bean sprouts and pickled vegs are free flow. Not to forget the furikake:
4
The gyozas here are handmade with fresh meat which is well marinaded wrapped in a thin gyoza dumpling wrap. We tried the pork and prawn fillings, they were delicious! A set dinner came with 5 gyozas, 2 side dishes, miso soup and rice. Great on taste at affordable prices. Awesome
5
Their formula meal is great!
So much offer for the same price!
Differently from the ramen restaurant, there are usually more seats available during peak times.
5
Great value for money. A set costs us 13.90 each and you get rice, a choice of soup, gyozas and two sides. The place is really cool inside and the staff are really super friendly. Would definitely go back!
4
A lunch meal costing 13.50SGD consists of five pieces of gyoza (pork, chicken or prawn), steamed white rice (they use decent japanese short-grained rice:), miso soup and two sides (egg, seafood, fish or chicken). Smart value-for-money. More importantly, the gyoza is prepared well!
5
We live nearby and are here perhaps once a week. The set meal has a lot of food, plus you get unlimited side vegetable dishes.
4
Perfect for a group of 4 or less. The place is pretty small and it depends on the crowd. Be expected to wait 15 to 30mins. Go for the pork & prawn gyoza! The 2 sides I enjoyed was the eggs and chives and fried fish. $13.90 a set
4
Liked the concept. I am not a specialist in Gyoza but liked that the space is cozy, uncomplicated, with an open kitchen, quick. The Gyoza was good and the side dishes make the right complement as they have many different tastes. Prices are Singapore prices, i hear for the cheap side but cannot judge that yet
4
One of the better gyoza shops in Singapore. Despite its gyoza size not befitting a "king" title, the GK set meal is intense with side dishes.In the set meal, you get to choose a gyoza kind (pork, chicken, prawn), size of rice, miso soup, and 2 more sides. My friend and I chose the sukiyaki with raw egg, chicken in sweet sour sauce, sautÃ©ed eggplant and battered prawn. Appetizer was bean sprouts. Very filling meal. Especially with a regular bowl of hot rice sprinkled with furikake on top. Worth a return trip. Guaranteed.

Came here today for lunch with a friend for the standard lunch and an iced Oolong tea. Food was decent and service efficient. Ingredients all seemed quite fresh. Pickled bean sprouts were also good although slightly too oily for my liking. Overall including tax and service charge it was about $19 each.
5
I tried the rest with my family yest evening aa it was close to my apartment. To my surprise it was delicious meal. I ordered pork gyoza set with chicken nanban and pork sukiyaki side dishes. I would come again for sure if i drop by singapore again
5
Amazing food. Gyozas are delicious and light. Great atmosphere watching the chefs in action. Really friendly staff. Love how they all say thank you in Japanese together. Set meal is real value for money!!!! Me any partner ended up sharing one which was more than enough to tame our late night hunger

Great Gyoza and nice meal set with good alternatives of small little dishes.
Also good for lunch. See how the Chiefs working by sitting o. The counter. Nice Gyoza !!!
4
A set $13.90 before tax.
Choose 2 out of 8 types of side dish
Choose 1 out of 2 type of soup
Choose 1 out of 3 type of gyoza
Rice included
The side dishes seem nicer than the Gyoza.
Overall very pleasant meal.

A rare find, this low-key restaurant had mini-tables outside by the street, set menu and rapid service where you fill the order on a piece of paper yourself. For $13 you get soup, rice, 5 gyozas and 2 side dishes. Not bad! Cash only.

Went there a couple of times with friends and colleagues and the feedback was always excellent!I particularly like the ordering process - simple, straightforward, and efficient. Just fill up a form and hand it to one of the staff there. Be prepared to wait a little. The few times I went, I waited about 10-15 minutes.While waiting, you can help yourself to some tea. It's chilled, mild, and doesn't spoil your appetite while you wait for the food.A set is about S$14 and with it comes: - A plate of gyoza (pick chicken, pork, or shrimp)- Two side dishes (I particularly like the brinjal dish)- Rice (In three sizes. The rice is great.)- Miso soupOn the tables, you get more garnishes/sides like pickled vegetables and beansprouts. Furikake is the bomb. That with rice is perfect.It's a cosy, rather authentic replica of a typical Japanese eatery on the inside and it get warm after a while despite the air-conditioning. I prefer to sit outside so as not to smell like gyoza afterwards.Do note that they do not take cards, so be sure to have sufficient cash on you

Their set comes with choice among 3 types of Gyoza - pork, shrimp & chicken, then 2 side dishes out of around 8-10 choices with rice & choice of vegetable or miso soup. The portions look small on the menu but they are very filling. They also have bean sprouts & mixed veggies at the table as appetisers. Think it's pretty good value for money. Great place for lunch or snack.

For $14 SGD (about $11 USD), you get a plate of gyoza, two side dishes, rice and soup, plus there are pickled vegetables on the table. Drinks are extra. The "side dishes" are small, appetizer-sized portions of proteins or vegetables. So they're not just, say, a little salad; they are substantial. I chose pork gyoza, stir-fried egg with chives, and shrimp with mayonnaise sauce, with rice and miso soup. The gyoza were good, if standard. The standout for me was the egg - like a well-seasoned runny scrambled egg, but so much tastier than just a scrambled egg. I really enjoyed the concept; since I love tasting a little bit of everything but not too much of any one thing, this meal fit the bill. With indoor and outdoor seating, you can choose where you will be most comfortable, relax and enjoy your meal. Service was quick and attentive. Each time the server brought a dish, he would ask to make sure he knew what dishes had yet to be delivered. Bringing the food out one or two at a time gave us time to enjoy each dish while it was hot, and the table never felt overwhelmed. A good choice if you're strolling through the Tanjong Pagar neighborhood

Keisuke is on his way to becoming a famous restauranteur in Singapore. With so many "me too" ramen places here, Keisuke always finds a way to innovate on classic Japanese dishes.Gyoza King is a true value at $13.90 for the set menu. The two side dishes are an unexpected bonus. I had the mayo ebi and chicken nanban which were standout dishes on their own.As Keisuke branches out into other Japanese cuisine, I can't wait to try them

I can't fault the food or service at this tiny restaurant in Singapore. I loved the experience so much I went back the following week to try a different combination of Gyoza and sides. Excellent value for money at S$13.90 for the set menu, fabulous flavours, and perfectly cooked rice. My favourite being the prawn dumplings, with the spicy chicken and egg plant sides
4
The gyozas are very good (nothing extraordinary) but still very good. Menu is fairly priced. For about S$20 you get a nice set meal, which is pretty good. The one thing that I can say is the best ever is the chicken with mayo sauce. Holy smokes !! I will be back just for that. They also do take away :-

The food was tasty but WAY too salty. I ordered the prawn gyoza and when I bit into it I discovered it was more than just prawns. Had I known it was a mixture of prawns AND pork, I would not have ordered it in the first place. Disappointing.
