Great place to have vegetarian food in a busy schedule. The ambiance was good, service excellent and the food was sumptuous and tasty...

Great to visit a place in Singapore that does vegetarian Chinese. Very cheap too. I ordered a two person dish without realising. The waitress asked me if I was sure about that...it was $8!! Spring rolls were awesome too.

I have been coming to Xing Hua for years, but they modernized their restaurant. Formerly just a counter where you pick food, it is now a comfortable seating area inside. Outside, under the umbrellas, it is still the same. Mostly processed food like tofu or soy meat dishes. Very good, very fast and if you are lucky also a friendly service. As a tourist they usually try to sell you more than you can eat, but their dishes are big enough, so you usually just need one dish. They have been around for 20+ years

Waited for a long time to order our food and super long time for our food to come. The auntie was so rude and she shouted at me when i asked if the food is ready after waiting for a long time. I was totally disgusted by the service no doubt the food is pretty fine. Second time, when i ask if the rest of the food was ready, another service auntie shouted again, that no choice, i say if there is no choice, can we cancel the order since we have been waiting for a long time, she say cannot, and mumbled vulgarities to me. The food served was not hot. Are they doing their job? Will never visit this restaurant anymore !

On the corner of a busy intersection, they do a great trade. Awesome food and great cold drinks and really friendly people. This became my local daily stop for a snack lunch and a cup of Ginger Tea. There isn't a lot of English spoken, and nor would I expect so, so when you ask what the food is they always say that it is nice and healthy.. And so it is! In such a busy part of the world, it is nice to be recognized, even if it is for your taste in ginger tea

The one of the best place to try chinese vegetarian food especially steam boat, satay and sushi. Being a vegetarin hard to find steam boat but this is perfect place to try tum yum steam boat. The staffs are very friendly and service is quick. The price is very competitive. During lunch time especially on weekend its very crowded. only drawback its very crowded if your sitting outside and feel warm
