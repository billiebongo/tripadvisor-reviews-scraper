Since the second opening, I have yet to patronise any Nene Chicken outlet. Decided to try on a rainy day and it was yummmmms! Perfect cold weather with hot steamy fried chicken.

Is a must try if you have happen to pass by this restaurant, they offer different kind of sauce that will taste good with the chicken.

Best place to have a chicken wing partyy..

All the hype about this being the best chimaek in Seoul... the franchise in Singapore here was a major let down. the Swicy sauce was a let down. However, if you have to compare this against major fried chicken franchises, this is comparatively better. But not the standard of Korean chimaekAnd, the store is small and stuffy... if you plan to eat i

I was actually a bit peeved when i waited a while longer, but upon enquiring the staff told me cause they use fresh chicken instead of frozen, and they fry in on the spot and thus take a slightly longer time. When the food were ready, it was definitely worth the wait

Used to be a big fan of their delivery menu but was very disappointed this time. They kept the price but without the drinks and fries and Korean pickles. It tasted awful with just the meagle chicken pieces, the pictures speaks for itself. I didn't bother to show the supposedly cheesy fries I ordered as sides. Total bill $24 .. for these 3 items

Visited Nene chicken with my Friend. Ordered freaking hot chicken and swicy popcorn chicken. Initially I thought swicy(Sweet+spicy) will be so sweet for me and freaking hot will be right choice as I love spicy food. But with the first bite on freaking hot, I realised the meaning of real hot and spicy food. Tears came out. However, I enjoyed it as the juicy chicken with the spicy sauce gave an unmatched taste. With this meal, I felt swicy sause also hot. Usually I don't drink much soft drinks with fast food. This time I finished the soft drink and even swallowed one icecube to cool down my tongue.They provide disposable gloves to handle the chicken and wet wipes for cleaning hands.Price is a bit high side and the service is slow - this may be due to they are cooking after we place the order. Outlet seating is too tight. Hardly 20 people can sit there. Overall a good place to try spicy Korean halal chicken

Amazing Korean fried chicken and is also halal. We ordered this to our hotel through an app known as foodpanda. Was quick and very convenient. In regards to the food, we ordered a box containing chicken wings and buffalo fries amongst other sides. All came with honey mustard sauce which has been the best honey mustard sauce I have ever tried till date! Chicken wings come with plastic gloves to keep the fingers clean from the sauce soaked wings!! Will always go back each time I go to Singapore! This is a must

Went to the one at Nex Mall Serangoon located at level 4 and nearest station is serangoon mrt station. Small and nice setting. Just that the tables by the side for single or couple seats are a little small. For 1 person is still fine but will be very cramp for 2 persons. Food wise is great with no complains. Ordered the 3pc meal that comes with a drink and mini cup salad. I got the soy flavor and it taste great. However, the twister fries is a little cold. Might be becos I went at a non peak period. Overall is good and will go back again.

Another one of those Korean chicken fast food chains, I thought. Back home, I was used to a competing similar breaded, spicy chicken cuts. But Nene Chicken is somewhat different. The chicken fillets were soft and juicy, not to mention tasty. I ordered the chicken tenders in green onion sauce, curly fries and orange juice. I had to wait about 15 mins for the meal to arrive, and I realized that they cook as you order. Worth the wait, I think. Fresh onion slices were a refreshing add-ons to the chicken, which fast food joints usually replace with powdered flavorings. The order came with plastic gloves and wet wipes, in order to keep strict food hygiene and for customers to easily clean hands after the meal. Not too healthy because food is fried, but it was definitely satisfying.

The food was good, properly prepared and a great value for the price. We highly recommend it.
I like the burger rice, that is very nice n frantasti....
4
Nice unbeatable spicy wings to date that leaves your mouth numbed such that the radish and drink included in the meal is not enough to put the spiciness out. Affordably priced compared to other korean chicken outlets that are springing up in sg.

The soy fried chicken was yummy, but the fries were not really nice. Enjoyed the rice burger too. Price is reasonable, though i hope they will have more selections of fried chicken flavours next time.
3
(One KM Branch) Satisfactory. Dun order Buffalo Sticks as it very thin, dry and small. The corn salad was also really small but tasted quite okay. Service was good and Cashier (Sun) was friendly.

This is for their Bukit Panjang Plaza Branch.
Compared to the typical Korean restaurants in Singapore where you would go for the chicken wings, the wings here is just as great. Or may be even better.
A value for money fast-food.

Visited the Star Vista outlet because Texas chicken was closed and I needed fried chicken. Worst idea ever. Over 20 minute wait for sub-par chicken. The swicy sauce was confusing and not at all nice, drenching my less than generous serving of chicken tenders. The original 2 piece serving was also less crunchy and less tasty than fried chicken calories are worth. The sides are strange - corn and crbsticks in mayo? gross. and the honey mustard was the cheapest crap I have ever tasted with no honey flavor and the mustard too spicy for fried chicken. They did not have ketchup. The staff are grumpy and don't seem to know what they are doing. The meals are overpriced for what you get. Finally, the seats are small and cramped. Not an enjoyable experience, avoid if you can

Nene chicken is really not bad - the chicken is decent, the sides are good as well (choose the radish its very refreshing!). However, it is let down because it takes forever (ok ok maybe not forever but more like 15 minutes which feels like forever) to get your orders even though the place is not crowded at all.The price is also higher than their usual competitors like Texas, KFC and what have you.

Had lunch at NeNe chicken, Hougang Mall. Ordered the two piece set which includes corn salad, buffalo sticks, Minute Maid orange juice. The two piece fried chicken comes with honey mustard sauce which I prefer to eat it with the buffalo sticks. They even provide a disposable glove and wet tissue for the convenience of the customers.

my 1st time, i ordered 2 pcs, i only go for one pc for freaking hot chicken (well, i was afraid i couldn't handle it) lol. but it got me addicted! so now i would go for all freaking hot chicken. love their buffalo sticks :

I LOVE spicy food a lot and it's so difficult to find a chicken that actually taste spicy. The first time I tried the swicy chicken, I was incredibly disappointed (I had thought swicy meant that the chicken is so spICY you will SWeat. Thought they were just being creative lol) I decided to give it a try another time and bought freaking hot. It was so good and exceeded my expectation. The buffalo sticks are really good too and the price may be a little expensive as it isn't filling but very worth it.I went to the outlet at scape and its pretty small and cramp. The time waiting for the food is also pretty long. But the cashier is nice and Nene chicken is the only place I go to when I crave for halal spicy chicken
5
Took the spicy chicken and it was super hot. Given disposable gloves to eat the chicken. Tasty chicken and worth trying.
5
Try the Freaking Hot Wings (name of dish) if you are a chilli fan, guaranteed on top spicy list from everything that claims that is chilli hot. Another to try would be the cheese wings. LOVE THEM! .

I bought the crispy chicken & the spicy chicken.
Friends recommended this place, how it's was not a pleasant experience for me.
It's just not my kind of crispy nor spicy for me.
Do try, maybe you love it maybe you don't like me.

Food was good. Orders came quick. And the workers there were all very helpful and friendly. Good service!

Went to have lunch at their outlet in Seletar Mall. First time coming during lunch as I always come during dinner. As usual there's always only 1 staff mending the cashier's counter. She's not very friendly and not approachable. Not a single smile on her face. When answering questions, she seemed reluctant. Totally opposite in comparison to the night service that we received. Might not come back for lunch here anymore. There's many other halal place that we can eat.

Clearly a place trying to capitalise on the recent korean fried chicken fad. the only items I felt were not bad were the fries and the popcorn chicken - crispy and tasty outside while juicy inside. the cheesy chicken was kinda a little too sweet and weird, imagine super ring tasting chicken. the spicy was too sticky and sweet, the original was more bearable (though our order was a bit over cooked) but if you like that sort of taste, fourfingers is actually a little better. was also disappointed they only offered soft drinks and mineral water - no non-carbonated drinks. i would have thought iced tea was a standard offering
1
Tried the swicy and cheesy chicken.The swicy is recommended o anyone who wants to get diabetes as it is overly sweet. Chicken pieces were very small.Cheesy chicken had bigger chicken pieces, was sweet as well and the "cheese" powder tasted weird.Overall the food is really bad, the place is cramped and the portion size is small for the price. Don't come here

I tried the Bulgogi Chicken set (it comes with 1 pickled radish and 1 coleslaw) priced around $24.00. The set was abit too heavy for us, but you can ask to pack away. Drinks is not included in the set. Please note only soft drinks and mineral water available. No hot drinks !!It was delicious ! I have never tried anything like it before ! Needs about 15 mins to prepare the food. I still consider it as "fast food".The Bedok Mall outlet is rather small. You can sit in and enjoy a quick meal because they do not serve any desserts. It would be nice to have a nice dessert to finish the meal with

The brand name caught my attention to try but unfortunately, did not meet my expectation. The idea of providing gloves to customers is something new. Nevertheless, having a tap and basin to wash would be much hygienic. It was rather dissapointing when the menu are fixed. Customers are not given the chance to mix the different flavours for any of the combo. The original flavour taste average just like any other fried chicken. I left the restaurant feeling hungry despite having 12 pieces of chicken.

An outlet tucked at the corner of Star Vista (#01-24), just opposite the bubble tea - Gong Cha outlet. Small seating area, it can get pretty cramped and crowded. Korean fried chicken (in varied flavours: Swicy (sweet and spicy), Freaking Hot (for the daredevils in us), Snowing Cheese (cheesy), Original, Green Onion, Sesame.. They have set meals (inclusive of a drink with nice thin fries - imagine MacDonald's Twister Fries taste) which cost $7.90 (chicken pieces like wings, drumsticks etc) or $9.90 (boneless chicken tenders). The flavours can be chosen when you order your type of chicken cut. Don't worry about making a mess while eating, the outlet provide plastic handgloves to eat so that you can just dispose the gloves after eating.
