Very good food, typical. I like the back yard better as inside is to Aircon and to noisy.
Quick service. An institution.
4
Most of the dishes are delicious. Service is pretty fast. Must make advance booking if you plan to go on weekends.
5
I think the best think I liked about this restaurant was that they actually de-shell the crabs for you!
Cheaper than some of the more popular Brands for crabs out there and just as delicious.
Will be back for more soon!
5
The restaurant serves delicious food but expensive. The chilli crab is really food and fast service as well!
5
We had a great meal at Hua Yu Wee. The chili crab and pepper crab were fantastic.
I love watching the kitchen work here. It is always very busy but food comes quick.
4
I had heard how good this restaurant was. It was good but not outstanding on this evening. Was packed and maybe this had a bearing service was slow food was mostly very good but some of the waiting times were just a bit irritating but overall very good
5
The chilli crab here is to die for and goes down a treat with cold tiger beers. The service was efficient and friendly too and the prices reasonable. Atmosphere was great, even on a Monday night and lots of Chinese families jovially shovelling down food with gusto. Will definitely come back
5
we were visiting singapore and were taken to this place by friends,it is a family run restaurant with seating inside and in the open .it was packed. you would need to make a reservation.looked very ordinary , but once the food started coming we couldnt stop licking our fingers. it was too yummm
4
Been coming here for the last 40 years. Dine-in or takeaway, the food is always good. Like how my mum does it. I love the Roast Chicken, Har Lok (Prawns in Special Sauce), Pai Kuat Wong (Spare Ribs King) and Beef Steamboat (the special chilli sauce is delicious).
3
Big restaurant with tables inside, but most of them outside. Service is fast and the staff is kind. Food was average, not bad, but wouldn't visit it again. Food was fast as well, but a bit pricey for this type of restaurant. Mostly locals in the restaurant with the whole family or business dinner, they had a lot of food on the table, looks like they are wealthy or got a different menu. We had two dishes and two drinks, and paid pretty much European prices.
4
good food and service and the seafood was delicious and fresh. The place was busy and there were many parties so it was quite noisy.
5
Great to get away from the shopping mall restaurants in this traditional Chinese restaurant. We had a feast: squid, duck, pepper crabs and chilli crabs. All apparently reasonably priced and absolutely delicious. Well worth it.
4
Ordered the chilli crab for our family outing and loved it! The sauce was amazing and I love dipping the mantous into the sauce! I think this easily beats out other places. However, come early for easy parking !As for the rest of the dishes.. meh... portions were small and completely overshadowed by their crabs.
5
Simple and very busy restaurant away from the tourists. They sell crab dishes to die for! Try their chili crab, butter crab and black pepper crab. Best ever! Many regulars here, the locals seem to love this place. I will return when I am in Singapore again

Hua Yu Wee Seafood located at 462 Upper East Coast Road, Singapore. It’s a basic place but it’s very busy with people. The ambience is basic, with a good atmosphere to enjoy the lovely local food that is on offer .Anyway if you are crab lover like myself, this place is great! It's the best quality crab meat in Singapore. Crabs are always super fresh, sweet and moist. We also had other dishes, and they all were scrumptious. But if u want great quality crabs in a pleasant no fuss environment then this is the place. Service was prompt given the fact that the restaurant was busy. .. We had a truly delicious meal which was very reasonably priced. The food was of excellent quality. The service staff were friendly and thoughtful, making our dining experience a memorable one. I highly recommended! I shall return
4
Good food with local service. Recommend to book the table and the crab in advanced as there are limited in door seat. If you don't book for a crab, you can get only one per table. Better if you go with local as staff speak limited English but be able to communicate in simple vocabulary.
4
The place and food still remains the same as when I was a little girl. No where else you can find a Cze Char place like the old days (Red House etc started in this area too out of a house like that. Used up be the beach out back). Good place to dine for a trip down memory lane and also enjoy good food in a old styled bungalow. Food is decent and
3
An institution of local cuisine; think of it as an upmarket Zhi char.Its had been decades since I first visited this place. Upon arrival, the restaurant was packed. Even with reservation, it does not really matter for the team of staff. A limited menu but with each category properly represented. Food arrived quickly and was dropped on the table with any announcement. The apparent of messy service is much alive and evident. Reminds me of the "old school Hainanese" service - abrupt and curt. Food quality of average or slightly above average while the crab was the savior of the evening. Honestly, except for memory sake of an old institution, one should not expect much from this outfit.
4
The reward for a set back in time was amazing. The meal of fried squid, drunken prawns, stir fried greens and chilli crab made the experience very enjoyable.The restaurant was full of local families enjoying the abundance of delights on offer eating at very large round tables.Would highly recommend if visiting Singapore short stay and needing somewhere to eat and experience the local cuisine a short distance from Changi Airport.Take a spare packet of oversized wipes if you want to take on the challenge of the Chilli Crab well worth the effort
4
I usually go for chili crabs, but the pepper crabs here are really delicious. The sweetness of the flesh stands out in this cooking method, probably because it's retained in the shells and not leaked out into any sauce like in the chili crabs. However you have to be able to tolerate the spicy pepper taste on the outside. The roast chicken, stir fried Chinese spinach, scallops and doufu were also tasty dishes. No corkage charge for BYO. We spent about SGD50 per person. Service was quick and efficient even on a crowded night. The car park is small so be prepared to valet park.
4
This is the place that the locals would go for crabs according to my taxi driver, the place is packed, and short staffed. Just have to be a little more proactive to get the waitress attention, and if you don't want the peanuts just tell them when they served it to you (Peanuts are not complimentary). If you don't like spicy but still want to have Singapore Chili Crab, then go for the Chili & Tomato Crab with Chinese Deep Fried Mantou
4
It's a tad bit expensive, but it's a seafood restaurant. Personally, I'm not really a fan of chili crab. Maybe it's the man tou that comes with it.... Instead, I like ordering salted egg crab. It's probably way more unhealthy, but whatever. The soups here are good, and the chicken and cereal prawns were also nice. Ask for some green chilis. They aren't very spicy, and have good flavor.
5
A familiar haunt to those who remember the line of seafood restaurants along Upper East Coast road. The last of the Mohicans but I am so pleased the food is great. If you need mod, pristine and matching chairs, skip this place. For what it lacks in ambience, the food sure made up for it.We fed 24 pax and all were happy. We started with the fried fish skin, stuffed you tiao and baby squid. For mains, we had feng sha chicken, drunken prawns, chilli crabs with fried mantou, stir fry kailan and lala hor fun.Dinner service was packed but service was good. Staff quickly attended to requests for drinks and chilli. Food came out piping hot and everything was fresh and the seafood was not over cooked.Special mention to the fried fish skin, baby squid which are such fun starters. The star of the night for me was the lala hor fun. It's name is a misnomer as the dish came with lala and prawns. And boy was there wok hei in the noodles. It was the perfect way to end our meal.I enjoyed the chili crab too. Soaking the fried bun in the gravy brought back many happy childhood memories. If I had to nitpick, I would say the drunken prawn though perfectly cooked came across bland. Happy happy eating. Will be backTip: book indoor air conditioned seatingTip: don't panic at limited parking. Valet available.Tip: they only serve dinner here. Call after 4pm for reservation.Tip: no corkage for wine

Hua Yu Wee is an old-school, traditional ‘Cze Char’ (aka ‘Zi Char’ or ‘Tze Char’) stir-fry restaurant serving what many Singaporeans would consider home-style ‘comfort food’. The sort of food that Chinese grandmothers and mothers have served to generations of Singaporeans. While fundamentally Chinese, the cuisine is often a fusion of Chinese cooking and spices and ingredients available in Singapore and the region. Over decades, this fusion has resulted in distinctly Singaporean dishes such as the famed Chilli Crab and Pepper Crab.Speaking of which, the Chilli Crab was sensational. Perfectly cooked crab in a gravy that was tremendously rich in flavour. In fact, the gravy is arguably more enjoyable than the crab-meat; sweet as it was. Their Chilli Crab, Black Pepper Crab and Crispy Sotong are highly recommended. That said, we had ten dishes and all of them were excellent. So good that we would be hard-pressed to find anything remotely wrong with them. We came away from dinner fully satisfied.The restaurant is situated in an old Colonial bungalow on East Coast Road. For a person who interested in heritage building conservation, it was a delight to see the bungalow being preserved and used. Admittedly however it would have been better used as a museum or similar.Service was efficient and courteous by wait staff who were dressed like Singapore Airlines stewardesses. We found this quite quaint.The restaurant is in two halves – the indoor section within the old bungalow and the outdoor area in the backyard of the property. It is subjective, and to your personal preference, as to which is better.Would I return to dine at this restaurant? Absolutely and hopefully soon!Recommendations / Tips:(1) Book a table as this is a popular restaurant.(2) Book an indoor table and be comfortable dining. Otherwise you can enjoy outdoor courtyard dining at the rear.(3) Arrive early for dinner to avoid the crowds.(4) Parking is available and free. Valet parking is also available for a nominal fee.(5) Open 4pm to 11:30pm dailyThanks for reading this review and my gratitude should you rate it as helpful. No pressure though...Life is short. Make your plans today and go travelling and makaning! Enjoy Singapore and its food

Quaint idyllic find along Upper East Coast Road. We celebrated my helper's birthday at the restaurant. Service staff were donned in batik inspired prints. Though old school but brought back fond memories of Singapore in late 70s and early 80s restaurant scene. The colonial building that housed the resturant contributed to the overall ambience of the dining areas. Restaurant got super crowded with both local and foreign guests on a Monday night after 7pm. Good thing we arrived before 6.30pm as cars quickly sprawled all over the small parking spaces. There are a few signature dishes. Probably good to try them out
5
Consistent quality of fresh ingredients and very good preparation, I have never been disappointed in the 10+ years of patronising this restaurant. My go to dishes - chilli crabs, rock lobster in black pepper, prawns (sweet sour/cereal/butter are all good), and a nice steamed fish. Service is prompt and friendly - gotta love the ladies in their Singapore Girl kebaya tops

Hua Yu Wee has a long history and was one of the beachfront restaurants together with Kheng Luck and Little Red House along Upper East Coast Road. Now there is only Hua Yu Wee left as the others have been torn down. This quaint eatery has withstood the test of time. The little "park" that you see behind used to be the beach but is now reclaimed land. Nostalgia aside, Hua Yu Wee dishes out a consistently good roast chicken, baby squids, chilli crab (better than jumbo's), and Lala Horfun. Even the Thai style tofu is very good. Crispy and fragrant on the outside, soft and melts-in-your-mouth on the inside. Prices are reasonable too! They don't sell wine but they do let you BYO. Service is homely and friendly. Do book in advance if you want to have a table at the air-conditioned area. Weekends are usually packed
4
This restaurant is located along upper east coast road, location wise it is better that you have your own private transport in order to reach this restaurant. The car park space is small, so there will be valet parking available to assist you. During rainy time, they even bring umbrella to shield you from the rain, very good service. The food serving is a bit slow as the crowd is a lot, the food is delicious and nice. Portion is quite big and price is valuable. Highly recommended to visit
5
It is located within a colonial bungalow along Upper East Coast Road. The restaurant is so consistent in the freshness and taste of their seafood. Moreover there is no corkage fee if you were to bring your own bottles unlike most restaurants. Food is excellent especially the crab dishes. We ordered the most original recipe and did not expect it to turn out so well! It was all impressive, at least to us with its most original flavour without additional sauces it was tasty in its juiciest and plump fresh. On top of that these crustaceans were placed on a bed of steamed egg which makes it presentable and unique in its style. Steam eggs were silky, light and refreshing. Next will be the chilli crab again but served in the mixture of Tomato Ketchup and chilli sauce. The amount of spice was well balance out by the ketchup. Meat was as fresh and plump
4
Locale is dated but gives the ambiance of a traditional place. No fancy decor, big open area for seating and smallish air conditioned area. Full of locals.We ordered the chilli crab and butter prawns. Food was excellent and reasonably priced unlike most seafood restaurants in SG. Overall a great value and definitely worth the taxi ride to the east coast. Avoid rush hour and you'll be there in a breeze.Make sure you specify the size / weight of crab you want, otherwise you will be served the heaviest one.I have been to Jumbo seafood and Hua Yu Wee is right there in terms of quality.
5
For the best crab - chilli or black pepper. Also their other dishes are superb - there's a reason why locals come here and there's no parking!
4
Delicious, authentic seafood without the markups or unnecessary fanciness of bigger seafood chains.
Had chilli crab and man tous, baby squid, sambal kangkong, Hong Kong Style steamed sea bass and seafood mee goreng. All very very tasty.
5
My Subject sums it up. Great Food - Best quality seafood and above all - extremely hospitable staff having good recommendation and great service.A great find - mostly visited by locals and the guests they bring. But highly recommended if you love seafood and are visiting Singapore 
4
Good Chinese food.Location has very few car lots so book early and park early.Sweet and sour pork is the best I have tried in Singapore.Fried chicken is super.Crab tasty and as good as other well known seafood restaurants.Overall good food.Service is by old aunties so be ready to wait a little especially when crowded.Will return
5
What a great night! From the moment we arrived at this huge outdoor restaurant, which is reminiscent of the seafood halls on the beaches of Bali and Thailand it was non stop yum!From the salt fish soup to the chilli crab, every bite was delicious. The service was quick and friendly and atmosphere was celebratory. We'll be back
3
Great and big area to hold at least more than hundred guests, although the air-conditioned area is smaller which is located in the building. But the big open area is nice and airy. Foods are good, Chili Crab,Seafood Kway Tiao and the Roasted Chicken are delicious. Their service was swift and attentive. Reservation is necessary during weekend.They have also valet parking, and if you drive please be there early (recommend before 7pm) if not parking can be a problem

Hua Yu Wee Seafood is probably the last remaining seafront seafood restaurant still standing in Singapore. The rest have all closed down or relocated elsewhere. Even the sea has moved away due to reclamation works. The sea is now at least 1 km away, with the East Coast Expressway in between on reclaimed land. Few years down the road, Bayshore MRT Station will also appear in between. You may want to pay a visit to this restaurant before it disappears.This place is packed for dinner. Parking is a problem. You may want to go early. If you go late, you will need to valet park. Reservations are a must if you wish to sit inside the air-conditioned area. Otherwise, you need to sit outside in the open. Call them before going down. But trying to reach them by telephone may be a challenge.The waitresses are all wearing kebaya tops like SIA stewardesses. I swear they also follow SIA hierarchy. Seems like the supervisor or manager is dressed like the SIA leading stewardess.The food is excellent. I like many of the dishes. My only complaint is that for almost every visit, the rice came very late. I particularly like the coffee ribs. Chilli crabs are also good, but I suppose crabs are good almost everywhere. There is no service charge
5
Was taken here last week by a friend now living in Singapore. Fresh off the cruise ship we ware looking for the best crab in town. Local dining was the way to go. A quick UBER ride and we were into the Chilli crab, black pepper crab and salted egg crab, some bok choy and tiger beer. FANTASTIC. Love local dinin
5
I have been here several times but stopped because of the wide food choices in Singapore. However I was pleasantly reminded of their excellent seafood at my last visit. A must try is the fried baby squid and of course the chilli and black pepper crabs. The service has improved tremendously since I last visited although it would help to have more English speaking wait staff. I wouldn't say it's a must-try restaurant but definitely a can-try.

Brought some overseas friends there yesterday. Valet was quick to help park the car. The restaurant was very very crowded and over filled both indoors and outdoors dining areas. Although I placed a reservation 3 days earlier, there was nothing reserved and 2 other parties were in the same predicament. The staff was visibly overwhelmed....Finally got a table after 25 mins wait, then waited another 10 mins to order tea and then another 15 mins for someone to fetch the menu and finally placed order for food after another 15 mins only to find out that they had run out on crabs.Finally the food came -- tasty and generous portions. We were happy with the butter crayfish in place of the pepper crabs.The staff became much more responsive and friendly once the crowd thinned out after 9 pm.I will probably eat there again, but only for late dinner on weekdays. And don't bother about reservations which does not work
5
We decided to go for chili crab after a game of mahjong and this place has been an absolute treat. Highly recommended!
5
Always consistently good.
Singapore chilli mud crab, pepper crab and deep fried squid my favourites among others.
Friendly service and always crowded.
4
We ordered black pepper crab , the crab are so fresh ! It's really the best crab that I ever had in Singapore! But the service was a little bit at downside as staffs in different uniform only can provide certain service. Like only can place order with staff in red uniform even though the staff in blue uniform is free. I wonder what's the duty of staff in blue uniform. Can anyone share with me ? Thanks
4
We had this practice of going for crabs during cny. This year we chose Hua Yu Wee seafood restaurant. It does not disappointed us. Though it served set menu during cny the staff is flexible to change items for us if you wish to swop or change the dish. As it is cny, the restuarant is packed with customers, so expect changing of plates are slower. They are quite attentive.Worth to visit the venue setting around the freehold property.
2
My family & I have been dining at this place for many years and I have also brought friends from overseas here a couple of times but my recent visit was a HUGE disappointment, both food and service!We there just last week for an 8 course+ desert (pre-CNY dinner for 8-10 pax) and few of the dishes were really bland. We were just served our 5th, 6th & 7th dishes when the captain ask if she could serve our last main dish yet. We said LATER as (1)we had just started on the 3 big dishes, (2)there were hardly any space left on the table for another big dish & (3)the last dish was the black pepper crab which we would like to have served hot. But just barely 5 mins after telling her that, a staff came and served the black pepper crab anyway. When I told her we have specifically instructed for this dish to be served later, after we are done with the 3 on the table, she simply answered rudely, "I'm only in charge of serving, talk to the captain if you want it later".. left the dish on the table and walked away! We also felt really rushed throughout the dinner and it was only 9pm. There was one point when the staff actually cleared the dish while I was still picking food from it!! Unbelievable!!! I know this is a casual dining place so am not expecting service excellence but just basic service and respect for your diners will be nice
5
Fantastic and fresh seafood , this is my 3rd time visit for annual dinner with colleague , the day is not so crowded which I feel the service is good and enjoyed the food much. I love the drunken prawn , squid paste you Tiao, Feng Sha Chicken (need reserve), butter crayfish, Mee goreng , we order two types of crab (Chili / black pepper) a bit spicy for me but is fresh and nice. Of course we have to eat Pen Cai for our annual dinner , the portion is very big cost $338 each , very nice with a lot of yam and lotus at the bottom .The location is quite far but is worth to pay a visit , price is reasonable . Due to Chinese New Year , will be more crowded and car park is limited space too, please make a reservation before you go.
4
Went there again last Sat for dinner with high school friends from Singapore, Kuala Lumpur and Shanghai. The car park was limited but there's valet parking. Only a few tables were available in the aircon restaurant converted from an old single storey bungalow. Most of the tables were laid out in the big covered seaside backyard. It was quite crowded and noisy but we enjoyed the food, especially the chili and black pepper crab
5
Been coming to this restaurant for 20 years. The food is always top quality. Service can be a bit hit and miss but the staff work really hard and are doing their best under the circumstances. Free corkage makes it very good value and it's good value anyway
5
My friend took me to this seafood restaurant. Luckily she already reserved the place, if not we sure cant get the seat. The restaurant is very crowded. We ordered chili crab, fried mantau, fried chicken, fried rice and shrimp yutiau. All the foods are very delicious and not too expensive. Surely i will come back again if i am in singapor
5
Really good food at value price. Have been going here for last 10 years. the restaurant is always full so please book early. The black pepper crabs and fish maw soup are really good. The service is prompt and they will always try to ensure that yor plates are cleaned for each and very dish.. So far, all the friends and guests have been very grateful for me bringing them here..
5
Great local food at good price ! Please take time to visit if you pass through Singapore !
À French guy 😜

I was there with my partner a few days ago and the experience was truly delectable. The food was superb and the service (despite the crazy crowd) was outstanding. It's an old colonial style building covered to a restaurant.The vegetables, the chilli crab and the Feng Sha chicken were all amazingly delicious and staff were very attentive to clear the plates.The restaurant was totally busy but the staff were all on their toes and very professional
4
We had a Sunday evening dinner in a party of 10 people. The good thing big group a lot of different food. From squid, to pepper crab, pepper crayfish, chill crab but also excellent porc (one of their signature dishes) to noodles - short we had a feast.The service was nice and attentive and sitting in the outside garden area the evening was pleasant. We definitely will be back
1
Small items like peanut, I did not order but was put into the bill despite reminder. In addition, there was another bad practice. I order a pot of tea for 3, but billed as 4. The reason given, count by per head. This was not made know when we ordered. Lastly, the seafood Hor Fun, was bland. Lousy
4
Went here for colleague farewell , had the 1) prawns Sweet goodness bursting with freshness . Oh so yum 2) steamed seabass hk style Fresh bouncy fish . Yummmm3) spinach in superior soup Good for the green intake 4) LalA in spring n ginger Was okay 5)Feng Sha ji Yummmmmmmmm moist and tender With different levels of tasty ness6) beef black pepper So so dish . 7)pepper and Chili crabs Fresh crustaceans goodness ! Was just beautiful Overall for the price it's 500 for 10 of us . It's inexpensive and such fresh seafood. It's a gem :)
5
We visit this Resturant at least twice a month. We take family, friends & colleagues, it never disappoints. The Resturant was originally on the East coast seafront before land reclamation. It is in a traditional Black & White building, there is a small indoor section with aircon, however go with the plastic chairs & fans outside to get a real experience. Also worth noting you can take your own wine, no corkage. Our favourite is Crayfish in Chilli Crab Sauce, it's a delicious alternative to Chilli Crab as everyone gets some meat.
4
We went on a Friday night and the place was packed. Luckily we had made a prior booking. The food was good and so was the service. But the attending staff is too busy to give you any smiles. This is a very popular restaurant and this was our second visit here
5
This is the last of the east coast beach front seafood restaurants, even though the beach moved east a long time ago. The restaurant is in an old compound style house and mostly open air, although there is an indoor aircon section. But sit outside soak up the atmosphere and enjoy Singapore seafood old school. You will love i

This is the second time we visit this restaurant. As it's well known to be a popular place, I deliberately called to make an appointment more than 10 days in advance. However, the restaurant didn't register my reservation. Fortunately, we were considered to be early batch (I.e.5pm), so they gave us a table next to the cashier. We ordered the deep fried soon hock, fried spinach, the signature chicken, fish maw soup, cuttlefish you tiao, and baby squid. Only the soup is alright, the other dishes were total disappointment. The only consolation is that it is not an expensive place. Price is comparable to zi char stalls outside. No service to comment on since they don't charge u service charge. It may be the last time that we will patronize this place as most of the dishes were really disappointing, either too salty, too bland or not as good as before.
4
We came to celebrate my grandma's birthday. It's a Sunday night and it's full house thus even with reservation, the food came about 2hrs later. However, they seriously have good food which explains the crowd. We had a kind of BBQ rib, crab (both chili and black pepper- dig the black pepper kick!), the horfun was really interesting and quite delicious, fish was fresh and nice and the chicken soup yummy! I would recommend this place to others but caution to make reservations and also to come when it is less crowded. Outdoor and indoor seating available. Children friendly (at least I saw young children running around).
5
Every Summer when I return home to Singapore. The first place to have my meal and before I head off for my studies again. This is where Singapore is tasted and kept deep in memory.
4
Pork ribs, prawn paste chicken wing (kids' favourite), and please order the crabs (pepper, chili or butter). Kids enjoy all the dishes, and butter crab shell was crispy enough to eat. Ideal for family gathering.
RSVP as restaurant is always packed (including weekdays).
4
As usual this place is always full with diners and parking can be a problem. You may use their valet which is free but tipping is expected.They should place fewer tables in the air conditioning hall so that guests can be more comfortable or you can also choose alfresco dinning behind the old stilted bungalow.Food is served very quickly and sometimes 3 dishes can be delivered at the same time so it's best to tell the server to pace your orders.Must order their fried fritters stuffed with seafood
3
We arrived later in the evening and were waved to an empty table, had a pot of tea delivered with efficient indifference, and managed to get one glass of water for the two of us. But we were here for the food, not the service.This establishment is reputed to serve chili crab for less expense (apparently SGD 120 per kg) than some of the downtown restaurants , and my host was determined that I try this Singapore specialty during my brief visit. The chili sauce was flavorful, although more garlic and sweetness than chili. The crab was fresh and meaty. Green beans with sesame seeds were crisp and tasty.An endearing feature of the casual environment is that one could dive in with two hands, crack the shells, and lick the fingers (good thing, as napkins were not available until after we had finished).Another reviewer notes that the prices have increased. At nearly SGD 100 for 2 people eating crab, green beans, white rice, and tea, this is not an inexpensive place
3
The menu was modified recently and prices were increased. Unfortunately, the portions & quality of food didn't improve accordingly. Tried the Roast Chicken, steamed fish and la la hor fun, and requested for less salt n oil, so we didn't go home thirsty as we used to
4
Serves up hearty seafood fare that is really quite delicious. The boneless chicken deserves mention and came with a green spring onion sauce that complemented the tasty chicken. Good value for money and a place where you can roll your sleeves up to enjoy the grub. Service could be better but in view of the packed restaurant, the staff can be seen to be trying to speed things up. Reservations should be made early especially for a table in the aircon'ed area as there are limited tables in the main house. Car park lots are limited too but they have some guys shifting the cars about in the small carpark if you do not mind having them park your cars.
4
this place is a converted old home which is used for dining and the kitchen seems to be built out on the side. the food was delicious. we had the deep friend prawns, pepper crab, chilli crab sauce with some sort of a deep friend bun, very very nice, and drunken prawns which were good but almost as much work as the crabs. the pepper crabs were cracked, which was helpful, really sweet crab meat with some fire spicy pepper sauce. the waitress was super super helpful. here is the thing , she wasnt even expecting a tip. she went out of her way to ensure we were satisfied. dont remember her name but would have given her a shout out
4
Celebrated my birthday with my friends at this restaurant. An old conservative house locates along Upper East Coast Road. It's not near any MRT. (Can be reached by taxi from Tanah Merah MRT or Bus Service 14 from Bedok Interchange.) Reservation permitted. No WIFI. Free parking. Clean restaurant. Waiters and waitresses collect orders. Food served. Settle payment at the cashier after meal.Food acceptable at above average prices.
5
I have tried a few Singapore chili crab dishes elsewhere but when I heard from my boss it was one of the first seafood restaurant in Singapore, I knew I had to try it. Overall, the dishes were fresh and tasty and authentically Singaporean; the chili crab tasted great while the dessert was vanilla ice cream with chilled mashed black glutinous rice, it was very nice
5
Great seafood, reasonably priced and always good. Those that know always come back to here.Doesn't have the pushy hype of the better known seasfood places in singapore, just great quality food. Get the crayfish (Moreton Bay Bugs) in either Black Pepper or Chilli Crab sauce or do what we do, and get both. :-
4
Great local food, served in a very local way, at an even greater price. I love these kind of restaurants. It's does exactly what it says in the tin. Slick service, great tasting food, wide range on the menu, no fuss, no frills, just damm good food
4
This restaurant have their own park place so you do not need have a problem if you drive. Waiter and waitress are very friendly and their price list is reasonable and they have quite a variety of food for you to choose. As a traditional kind of restaurant they are actually consider very good. Food are delicious and a must to order of course will be their chilli crabs with their buns to dip into the sauce ~ super yummy

Hua Yu Wee Seafood is a $20 taxi/uber fare from downtown Singapore but well worth the trip.This place is well known and filled with locals who are a wake up to the fact that not only is the seafood the best you can get in Singapore but also at near half the price of some of the better known restaurants in town.We did not have a booking and when we walked in the staff ordered us here there and everywhere and seemed quite unhappy that we were there so the service here gets the thumbs down but we were here for the chilli crab and we were not let down.The Chilli Crab was sublime and the sauce was thick and spicy but not over the top.The kitchen had already cracked the shell which made it a lot easier to eat.We tried the peppered cray fish which was also special.We had some beans with the meal and our bill came to just under $100.This place unlike most don't add the service tax so the waitress was a little put out when I did not tip so be aware of this.This place allows BYO wine so don't forget to grab a bottle to avoid the silly pricing
5
We go to Hua Yu Wee at least once a month and are never disappointed. Our favourites are the pepper and chilli crabs, steamed prawns, fried and steamed mun tow, deep fried baby squid, spicy fish, lala horfun and sweet & sour pork. These are our staple dishes and sometimes we try other dishes, like the tofu or beef, depending on how hungry we are. The food is perfection. The service is good too. LOVE IT!

I I’ve been to this restaurant twice and have been blown away by the delicious crabs both times. I’ve always preferred black pepper crab to chilli crabs but this restaurant does their chilli crabs so well that they converted me. However, their black pepper crabs and butter carbs are also worth trying. Its worth noting that their chilli crab is actually spicy and not sweet as at other crab places in Singapore. So stick to the butter crab if you can’t take spice as their black pepper crab also has quite the kick. The restaurant also does amazingly delicious prawns – I think they are butter/steamed prawns – which are definitely worth having. The best part of the restaurant is that its not overpriced like many other crab places on the island. You can easily have a very full meal with a variety of crabs and other dishes for $50 per head. Also I personally haven’t had an issue with their service levels and don’t think its an issue that takes away from the finger-licking food

great good which keep me coming back here for more .food is delicious which you can also see from the previous reviews.recommended1) chill crab2) drunken Prawns3) Feng Sha Ji (chicken meat) 4) pork ribs all the above are very good and you wont go wrong with it
5
We always enjoy coming here and especially to bring overseas visitors who want to try the Singapore chili crab. The chili crab sauce is fantastic, so get lots of buns to soak it up. The pork ribs are good for those that do not enjoy seafood. It is BYO wine with no corkage which helps dramatically in keeping the price down. They have a good system for valet parking and your car appears quickly when you need it at the end of the night. The ambience is very different to most Singapore restaurants but it is enjoyable to sit outside and feel like you are at a party in someone's backyard - don't bother getting dressed up
5
Despite its large size that can accommodates dozens and dozens of hungry mouths, Hua Yu Wee does not compromise on quality and every dish that we had was delicious! Strongly recommend the chilli crab! it is yummy - you can't get enough of it! Next time I will have to try the black pepper as everyone seems to be raving about it. The service is fast and efficient and take a look in the massive kitchen - there is an army of cook there but it is spotless
5
I have been traveling to Singapore for many years. I have had chili crab all over the island. Hua Yu Wee is by far the best for these dishes. Inside is an air-conditioned dinning room that is more formal. Outside, in the back, is a typical local Singapore style restaurant. We sat outside for sure. We ate the Chili Crab, Pepper Crab and Chili Prawns. The Chili Prawns were so good, we ordered a second portion. If you want authentic Chili Crab, eat outside in the back. Order extra buns, the sauce on the Chili Crab is fantastic. I am done searching in Singapore, i will return here every time
5
This is my favourite seafood restaurant for entertaining overseas guest as well as my local relatives and friends. This evening, I have ordered 1kg of Chilli crab and specifically reminded the staff to keep the spiciness mild as my guest cannot handle too much spice. The Chilli crab turns out just the way we wanted. Our Initial 6 fried buns to dip with the Chilli crab sauce was so good that we had to order another 4 more. We had the deep fried baby squid that was so tasty and crunchy. The drunken prawns was so fresh and well balance with the brandy that was used to make the soup. The price here is at least 20% cheaper than the seafood restaurant chains at East Coast park or Clarke quay
4
Good food, good choice. Set Dinner for 4 pax including drinks, near to SGD200.00
Only problem is parking, went there before Chinese New Year, car park was full, valet parking not available that night, have to drive to their private car park myself/
5
My local friends took me here for dinner to try Chili Crab. This was fantastic. I really enjoyed it. The fruit plate at the end was great. We really enjoyed the mango.
5
Eat inside or outside. Best Chinese food I have had in years Our party of 6 + baby was well looked after and the prices were very reasonable. There is a huge open kitchen at the front - everything is fresh.
4
If you're after quality and family atmosphere where the locals bring their friends then look no further than this quaint haven on the east coast...you should book a table as it's always busy...the crabs are always fresh and the sauces divine!! It's not too expensive and much better than some of the popular tourist chilli crab haunts...I've been here a number of times and the quality and consistency is great value always
4
Their Mee goreng is excellent. Never tasted such good food. The seafood of cos is TOP notch. Crabs are their specialities tho I have to admit I am not much a fan of crabs but they are nicely cooked. Worth a second try again for sure
4
Very casual restaurant with indoor and outdoor seating that I must visit every time I am in Singapore. The place always seems to be packed on weekends. The food is consistently good which is why I keep coming back. For those that are not crazy about seafood, they still would be able to find quite a bit on the men
3
Food here is nice generally and more reasonably priced than many seafood restaurants. Steamed fish and chilli crabs are consistently fresh & very delicious in all my visits. Love their seafood bee hoon & small portion is enough for 2! Tastes good but salty despite requests for less salt + oil. Hokkien noodles are nice but EVEN MORE salty
4
I love to bring overseas friends to this restaurant for seafood. It is delicious and the price reasonable. The service is excellent yet there is no service charge. So make sure to tip them if you're happy with their service.It is a nostalgic place to me as Upper East Coast Road was where my parents would bring us to dine on delicious seafood whenever we had seafood cravings. Restaurants like Kheng Luck, Red House and Palm Beach used to be located here. If you want to avoid the heat, ask to be seated inside the colonial style bungalow which is air conditioned. If you want to enjoy outdoor seating, opt for the back of the bungalow with shelter and fans. Chilli and black pepper crabs are items not to be missed. Don't forget to order the mini fried buns to dip up the chilli crab sauce. If you are not good at eating crabs or find it a hassle, try the black pepper crayfish instead.The cereal prawns (shrimps) is always a favourite amongst kids. Lightly battered prawns coated with crispy cereal. It's too sweet for me but kids love it
5
I lived in Singapore for a few years and moved away to KL and now living in Bangkok, every time I go back to Singapore I make it my 1st choice restaurant to visit, it is mainly local people eating here, it is run by a number of old ladies who have been there forever and the crab is fantastic.If you want to go somewhere fancy then this is not the place, this is down to earth shorts and tee shirts and fantastic flavours that is excellent value for money
4
One of the original seafood restaurants in it's original location before land was reclaimed in Singapore.. can't imagine what it was like next to the sea.This place brings nostalgia due it's old school style alfresco seating at the back. For those wanting air-conditioned bookings are essential in the colonial white bungalow. Tried a few items like lala (baby clams of pipi), will be back to try their chili crab and crispy baby squid
5
The chili crab was amazing, although the black pepper crab was also really good! Nice atmosphere, good service, reasonable pricing.
3
Despite reserving in advance we were seated in non air conditioned shed. Few staff spoke English. Over priced and ordinary food. $20 for 6 scallops. Small steamed sea bass in soya sauce $30. Medium crab $60. Men's toilet was very smelly and wet with urine over a good part of the stalls floor. Perhaps this is authentic touch but for me it did not meet expectations Food was just above average if you have been around Asia a bit and get to taste great food
5
Good service and consistent food even on crowded weekend. Not the most extensive menu but everything that is on it is great!Bring your own wine with no charge. ( they will charge for compulsory tea if you bring your own wine) Must have is Feng Sha chicken, prawn rolls and LaLa Hor fun
3
Reminded me of the local Chinese food we ate in Malaysia and Singapore 20 years ago. Had black pepper crayfish which were delicious, butter prawns, spinach tofu, garlic Kai lan, sweet and sour pork, 1 beer, 99 sing dollars so very good value for Singapore. Need a taxi, around 12 from CBD. Can take your own wine, no corkage charges. We really liked it but depends on your expectations, our teenagers weren't impressed, but if you like local no frills food then would definitely recommend
4
I'm not a vegetarian but this place had the best tofu I have ever tasted! It was so silky and my friend who is Singaporean took us there because of it. Every thing was good from the prawns to the chilli crab, you won't be disappointed.We ate outside in the garden area although they do have indoor seating if you prefer. I was interested to hear the story that the beach started at the end of the garden, now it is a jungle because of reclaimed land.Service was great and they explained the menu in case you weren't sure. Will definitely come back when in Singapore
5
Recommended by locals this was a real delight. Ideally suited to families or groups the seafood was something that has to be experienced. Chilli crab was the best, cereal prawns were great and the venison was very tender and full of flavour. Seafood was very fresh and reasonably priced. If visiting Singapore and you enjoy seafood you cant miss this place
5
One had heard of this place from local connoisseurs. It is reputedly the only sea food restaurant allowed to continue on East Coast Road while most of the others were shifted to the Seafood Park. We reached a little late in the evening and the valet had a tough time to park our car. We had to find a table in the open air dining at the back of the main building, as the place was full of large groups tucking into the tasty food. An earlier reviewer had said that this was no place for single visitors and I think he was right, as I did not see any table with less than 6 chairs. We were a group of 4 and did not occupy even half of the huge table. We had ordered fried fish skins, beef, a veg dish, fried rice and crayfish curry ( in place of chiily crab which had finished as we were late). The beef and vegetable dish tasted great; we didnt miss the chilly crab, as the crayfish was delicious. The buns which came with the crayfish dish were soft and fluffy. Draught beer provided the right accompaniment.The biggest surprise was the bill which was less than half of what the seafood joints in the ECP would have charged. With the beer, watermelon, juice, tender coconut and the tea, our total bill for 4 persons came to SGD 82.We will return for good seafood in heritage ambience and moderate prices
3
I can tell that this restaurant is probably great if you're eating in a group and can order things like the chilli crab. However if eating alone your options are limited as the menu is really aimed at large groups. It's also not the easiest place to get to so I'd advise if travelling alone to look for somewhere more accessibl
5
Established seafood restaurant with very good food and service. The location and setting are rather unique -- the place still retains some of the old "East Coast" character, albeit not situated on the shoreline anymore. This is a seafood destination that older customers will find quite nostalgic and very pleasing. Most patrons go for the Chili Crabs and Black Pepper Crabs. Prices are reasonable and, with BYOB, this is certainly a good place to bring your foreign visitors
5
This restaurant is a gem in Singapore. Friendly staff, clean and the best crayfish. The baby squid was crispy, unusual taste, but very good, the steamed fish was perfectly done, spinach tofu was heaven and the chicken and other vegetables were perfectly cooked. Everybody loved it. You can bring your own wine, they give you an ice bucket, no corkage and the price for Singapore seems fair. Will definitely go there next time I am in Singapore
5
This restaurant has the best Chili crab.. My favourite!
We always try to come in this restaurant when we are in Singapore
5
The chilli crab is to die for. Make sure you order deep friend mantou to go with it so soak that gravy up. Service is top notch.
5
The black pepper crayfish were stunning as were the olive fried rice and deep fried duck. Really, really good food. Great building, service and a buzzing atmosphere. The outside seats are great but don't sit under cover unless it's wet. We even saw an eclipse.
5
I've tried a variety of food in Singapore, and this was my first time here last night. Highly recommended by my relatives and it was absolutely not disappointing. All cuisine including seafood, chicken, duck, vegetables, noodles, rice, etc. is delicious. I'm not a fan of meaty cuisine but I have to agree that the grill chicken and fried duck cutlets with bean curds are incredibly tasty. The restaurant has its own compound and it's comfortable. It's oriental and portrays Chinese culture. Besides, the service was good and the staffs were friendly. Ohh, I start drooling for the food again.....
5
A long time patron of Hua Yu Wee Seafood, this seafood restaurant is the only one rooted along Upper East Coast Road. To many who is not aware, walk to the back of the restaurant where you can see a mini foilage, that is the early days of Singapore shoreline. Beyond those trees is actually reclaim land. Chilli crab is excellent and price is the MOST REASONABLE I have ever eaten even if you have attempted to buy a big 1.5kg Sri Lanka mudcrab at some fresh market. They have perfect the Chili recipe and my upper palate tells me there is no dried shrimps paste where many places are using and they do not use corn starch that makes the gravy watery after sometime. If you plan to go on a weekend, pre order the Kampung Chicken Soup...prepare to pay more than $50 as it is such a huge pot. The broth is definitely savory which makes you think ... where or when did I taste it. Just love this place, everyone is so friendly, even the crowd who are mostly residents living nearby
5
Good quality seafood restaurant between Siglap and Bedok Corner. Has improved quality and taste recently, it went though a rather mediocre and rather disappointing period around a year ago, But the meal last night was back to the earlier and better standard. It is not a cheap place to eat, especially if ordering crab, but the black pepper crab here is the best I have tried in quite a number of locations around Singapore.Best book a few days in advance if you want to dine in the Air Con sector and weekends, phones only answered after 4pm for bookings - not open for lunch. Parking is at a premium and is 'jockey parking'

I have been told it is the best original seafood paradise in Singapore.....hey it was not bad but not great either. The black pepper crab was ok, succulent crab meat but nothing to rave about. The wasabi prawn was ok, did not get the wasabi kick. The pepper cuttlefish was a bit too sweet and so was the deep fried tofu with a seafood was also sweet. The noodles was soggy. Service was mediocre. The atmosphere of a typically busy and buzzy chinese seafood restaurant was lacking. I got the sense there was minimal effort to do better, it relied on its old reputation and patronage. Would I return and recommend to tourists...nope. There are so many more delicious and exciting seafood restaurants in Singapore fior the same price
4
The food here is nicer than many famous tourist restaurants in city centre. Its black pepper crab is really good and fresh, but its chilli crab is bit too sweet. The restaurant is truly for local and far from MRT, so don't expect international service style, but the staff can speak fine English. The price is also very reasonable, cheaper than Jumbo or No Signboard but better food quality
4
The location of Hua Yu Wee on Upper East Coast Road was the original area where all seafood restaurants started in the 60's. Whilst all others moved to the East Coast Centre and other up market locations and now charge a fortune for their dishes, not always of high quality, this restaurant has managed to preserve its nostalgic state in more ways than one. Firstly the restaurant is not overly noisy, and its calm setting is very conducive to pleasant conversation for friends and family.Our dishes started with crispy fish skins and what a delightful starter with the sweet chilli sauce.Highly recommended . Our children are not in depth seafood lovers so it was stir fry beef and ginger which was nicely sauteed, minimum oil, tasty sauce, The steam prawns were firm, fresh and crunchy with the deep fried Soon Hock were a great combination. Chilli Kang Kong was the right amount of sambal and again with just sufficient oil otherwise this dish can easily be inedible. I loved their "hor fun " style Mee Hoon with seafood. Not too much starch to make the noodles soggy...nicely done....The children loved their salted fish fried rice and they were happy. My guest ( usually very hard to please with food) and his daughter were very satisfied with all the dishes which made for a really pleasant evening.My friend kindly shared his Yamazaki 18 years with me and with spirits and wine not charged any corkage this was the cream on the top.Although a Friday, the restaurant was busy but not full, which made service quite prompt and the ladies were extremely polite and cheerful.For $150/- ( Dec 12th '14) I could sincerely challenge anyone to find seafood of better value and quality in such original delightful surroundings
4
Visited this restaurant recently to celebrate my mom's 80th birthday. This restaurant only operates for dinner. It opens at 5 pm daily. When we visited at about 5 the car park is virtually empty. However when we made our way out after our dinner, it was packed. There is an aircon area as well as a non-aircon backyard. The seafood served here is very good. The price is unbelievably affordable. Service can be better but I guess you cannot expect service when you visit a place where food is affordable and delicious in Singapore. A few dishes worth recommending. The roast chicken is crispy and juicy. The crab is excellent. The prawns are fresh and tender. Reservations is highly recommended especially for weekends. Do check out this place for delicious and fresh seafood at well affordable price. The service here can be a bit slow at times but the staff can be seen trying their best and they are definitely not rude
3
Not bad place at the east for chilli crabs. Other dishes like crispy sotong and sambal vegetables ain't too bad.
Price a bit at the high end tho.
4
I have been tot his restaurant many many times. The food is freshly cooked and always tasty and this is what keeps me coming back. However the service is a bit hit and miss and sometimes a little feisty- but just let it wash over you and once you get your food order in - you're away and the food comes very quickly. Just make sure you bring your own bottle of chilled vino and get them to bring you some glasses and an ice bucket whilst you wait for them to take your order. They also serve large bottles of chilled beer. I always sit outside as it tends to be less noisy than inside as it is constantly mobbled. Don;t worry about the car parking - they will move you car around in the car park! Try the deep fried squid, chilli crab, steamed fish and any stir fried veggies.Bon appetit
5
Having lived in Singapore for many years Hua Yu Wee is always the first stop. Out of town on East Coast it is to my mind without doubt the best seafood in Singapore . Always excellent fresh and tasty everything on the menu is good but the prawns , crayfish and clams deserve special mention. Consistency is the key and Hua Yu Wee always delivers
5
Every time I visit Singapore my best friend always brings me here! So I've lost count how many times I've eaten here over the last 15 years. The food is remarkably consistent and we always order the giant chili crab and the roast duck, for mains, amongst other dishes such as the steamed shrimp and sweet squid for appetizers and the fried rice and mee goreng to top things off. Order whatever you like because every dish is fantastic. The restaurant is located off the expressway on the way to the airport so it's a 20 minute plus ride from CBD depending on traffic. There is a large air con room and also non air con tables outside. The restaurant is almost always full so better book if you want a table. There is limited parking right in front but they seem to fit in all the cars somehow. We never have any problems calling a taxi back to our hotel at the end of the evening. A must-try restaurant in Singapore
5
We like this seafood restaurant very much. Very often we entertain our guests here. For this meal, we wanted to try different method of cooking the crab. So we ordered chilli crab, black pepper crab and butter crab. Also the chilli clam. The steam prawns, kanggong as well as fried baby squid.This time round they have this really nice appetizer (pickle vegetable) and it was so good.All turned out perfect! I also recommend the Thai tofu which is really good
4
This seafood restaurant housed in an old bungalow with a spacious backyard that doubles up as outdoor dining area (ORA) serves affordable and tasty food esp. pepper crabs and their signature mee goreng! Opens only for dinners and usually packed on weekends, you have also to be patient for service is pretty slow but persistence helps! A good zi char joint for family and friends who enjoy digging into the crabs fried to perfection with lots of black pepper
5
I've been living in Singapore for 2 years now and been trying many different crab joints - with local colleagues, with fussy visiting friends, with family & kids....And this one got it all: the authenticity, the crowd, the atmosphere - it was perfectly mixed between old Chinese lads smoking cigarettes after their dinner, kids playing with balloons, friends chattering while drinking beer - and above all the crabs. I wanted to try a new restaurant, less touristic than Jumbo or NoSignBoard and my coworkers didn't know about a nice plan close to Joo Chiat/Katong where I live. I found Hua Yu Wee via Google and Oh Lord! THANK YOU!Paid 115$ for 2 big, hearty sri-lankan crabs: 1 chilli, 1 black pepper. Chilli was perfect, slightly-sweet chilli, abundant gravy, golden buns, all was perfect, fresh and tasty, not oily. Black pepper was very fragrant, not too salty or greasy. We had garlic kai lan and fried rice on the side, was perfect too.I am not a local Singaporean but I've been living in Asia for long now and this restaurant is a delicious chinese-singaporean place and excellent value for money.Bonus: staff is great, old smiling uncles & aunties + outdoor dining + late service (11pm).Definitely going back for more

Hua Yu Wee is and old style old crab restaurant in and old house with a huge outdoor seating area in the back. Years back this restaurant was o the coast but thanks to the land added to Singapore over the years it is no longer on the coast. It is the last of the old restaurants still on Upper East Coast road.The food here is great and if you know what to get you can get a great meal for about 30% less than you'd pay at one of the name crab restaurants in East Coast Park or along the river. My wife and I much prefer the crab at Hua Yu Wee to that from Jumbo or No Signboard. We particularly like black pepper crab and it is wonderful at this place. As for the chilli crab it is also very good and not as sweet as at Jumbo, much tastier and better for soaking up the sauce with your buns. We've also had the salted egg crab which is good but very hot (thermally). They also have very good fried baby squid, drunken shrimp and excellent fried rice. Overall the Chinese food is very good and a great complement to the crab. You can bring your own wine, which is great and they will give you an ice bucket for cooling the white. Otherwise they have beer at decent prices for Singapore. Service is hit or miss, you will get served your food in a reasonable amount of time after you order but sometimes getting the check is a challenge. We found this place through a local friend and when we went there the taxi driver was surprised we knew about the place (as we are expats) and asked how we found out. The place gets packed on a Friday or Saturday night so make sure you have a reservation. Best to go with a large groups so you can try multiple kinds of crab

Full Hua Yu Wee review here: http://ivanteh-runningman.blogspot.sg/2014/06/zi-char-hua-yu-wee.htmlHua Yu Wee is a Chinese Zi Char eatery that exudes a touch of nostalgia. The only 1970s seafood restaurant that has stayed at its original location, Hua Yu Wee serves up tasty and beautifully presented old school Chinese fine dining Zi Char dishes at mid-range yet affordable prices, all in a charming colonial setting.Ambience at Hua Yu Wee channels its colonial past. The huge white mansion houses not only the restaurant, but also the living quarters for staff. And while the indoor air-conditioned area is rather small, there is a large outdoor seating area, sheltered by awnings. I imagine ambience used to be much better in the past when Hua Yu Wee was next to the sea, but reclaimation of land has changed the landscape behind Hua Yu Wee to a jungle.Service at Hua Yu Wee is old school as well, staff are polite and efficient, with a certain air of elegance. They wear a brightly coloured pattern kebaya top, reminiscent of the national airline, fitting as it seems Hua Yu Wee is now managed by an former cabin crew who retired from flying. That may explain why staff are observant and attentive, generally standing by and observing tables in case they're called.Master chef Mr. Teo Ah Chye heads up a team of 10 chefs in the Hua Yu Wee kitchen. While the menu isn't extensive, they produce great tasting classic Chinese Zi Char dishes, all tasty and flavourful, and presented beautifully. Small portions are usually enough for a group of 3 - 4 people, while large portions are sufficient for up to 10 - 12 people. And despite the fine dining status, prices at Hua Yu Wee actually cheaper in comparision to other major seafood restaurant brand names.Hua Yu Wee is highly recommended by regulars of the place, who even know about several off the menu items available here. Reservations are recommended! The Fresh Prawns And Tomatoes On Ice (SGD $15 per 100 grams), also known as Wasabi Prawns or Sashimi Prawns, is a signature off the menu item only ordered by those in the know. The 1-day advance order ensures only the freshest, juiciest prawns are used, butterfly and laid on ice surrounded by butterfly tomatoes. The dish is consumed by first dipping the fresh prawns into a mixture of light soy sauce and wasabi paste, then slowly savouring it! The Crispy Baby Squid (SGD $12 medium) is absolutely crunchy, with a slight sweetness from the marinade. Even several diners who don't enjoy squid gave this dish a thumbs up!The Chili Crab (SGD $75 for 1.5 kilograms, medium) was delightful. A fresh, meaty crab with roe, doushed with a spicy, savoury, tangy chili sauce, accompanied by crisp Fried Man Tou Buns. Very good, and cheaper than elsewhere! The Olive Fried Rice (SGD $16) has a interesting textural contrast from rice krispies that are sprinkled over the dish. The olive taste is prominent in the rice, but I thought the overall combination was only decent at best
4
Great food quality for the price. Booked on a Friday and wife didn't like table they gave us so we were changed. No problem. Service is OK, but don't come here expecting airs and graces!The chilli crab is as good as anywhere. The sambal crayfish brilliant! Veggies in garlic were excellent. Kids ate all the egg rice so we had to order twice. They absolutely loved it. Only thing was the duck looked a little tired. It tasted fine though. If you want to be miserable here you can, the waitresses won't go out of their way to make you happy, they are busy ladies. But if you speak nicely and have fun, they are great hostesses.The BYO option is good, if you like wine you have to take your own.There is no stigma to that, even saw people with bottles of spirits they brought - which seemed a little OTT.BUT GREAT FOOD, CLEAN ENOUGH AND GOOD VALUE
4
Very good food! Staff could be a little nicer. Ver local. Delicious black pepper crayfish! Love that place! Nice setting outside in the jungle
4
This restaurant has been operating in Upper East Coast Road for a few decades and still serve consistent and superb quality seafood dishes. Only constraints is the small car park lot in front yard if the restaurant especially on weekends.price is reasonable and food deleious.
5
Its an old charming bungalow with large backyard over looking huge trees and park. Chilli crab and seafoods here are fresh and tasty. Its away from tourist so good prices and friendly. My table was in the backyard and its great spot. Impressive place. I will be back.
4
We ate here on a Saturday night (having made a reservation). The restaurant is quite far from Central Singapore, in a very charming neighborhood. We were shown to our table outside (great atmosphere), then inexplicably moved five minutes later, even though both tables were exactly the same size and next to each other. We were only able to order at the third time of asking, as the previous two times the waitresses just walked off as we were in the middle of placing our order. We had to follow up on our drinks, as they hadn't come 20 mins after we ordered them. The waitresses also have a habit of barking at their customers, and are generally exceptionally rude and annoying. That said, the black pepper crab is excellent, and reasonably priced. We will definitely come back, with expectations regarding the service managed. Be warned, however, that you will be served tea and peanuts, and then charged for them. Not much (total of S$5), but it is a little cheeky
3
This has great character situated in a large old bungalow with a huge garden at the back.It is a small menu and there are far too few staff given how packed it was on Saturday night.We waited twenty minutes for our reserved table and then a further forty minutes to order.The food when it came was ok but nothing more.Unbelievably rude staff barking at you is the memory you take away.Not worth it for so-so black pepper crab.I am told it is much quieter on week nights and maybe the staff are in a better frame of mind.Just avoid Saturdays
5
Make a reservation, essential. The food is stellar. They have a bring your own wine/beer/whisky policy no corkage charge.Order the three crabs chili, black pepper or salty egg. All are fabulous. The caramelized squid is to die for. The service is olde world, polite, friendly and efficient. The cost is not cheap but it really is very good food
5
Forget Jumbo and all the other mass marketed central singapore seafood restaurants. Get in a cab and out to one of he originals - hua yu wee. It's where the locals eat, it's cheaper, it's better, it's just a much more authentic experience, plus it's a nice adventure to get out if town
5
This restaurant is well worth exploring as it has excellent food. The Chili crab was excellent. Definitely authentic and just the type of restaurant that the tourists will never find. I travel to Singapore about three times a year and this is a must stop restauran
4
Went there for dinner with family. The restaurant is housed in a bungalow. It is located along East Coast (main) Road. Though it is a bit further from town and where tourists would visit, it's not that far actually, you can reach there abt half an hour by cab from town.It's a weekday, though it is during dinner peak hour, there are still lots available at the car park within the compound, free parking. Service is reasonable, food is generally good. We ordered:- 1 chilli crab: flavourful, 'meaty', served with tiny fried buns, "shiok"- deboned chicken, very nicely done- li-li-xiang (translated to every grain is fragrant) fried rice: a bit disappointing, too dry to our liking, there are bits of deep fried rice grain used as garnishing, we didn't like- la-la hor fun (flat noodles/kuayteow fried with clams): we like it a lot, something different from the usual hor fun we get elsewhere- vegTotal bill came up to S$135 for 5

Hua Yu Wee serves great Chilli Crabs, in fact the best in Singapore! The crabs here are of the right size and very meaty. The sauce is heavenly and goes well with the deep-fried mantou (bun) although I wish the size of the mantou could be bigger...........Pepper Crab is great too, the pepper sauce tastes 'herbie' and finger-licking good! Other must try dishes includes Drunken Prawns (very fresh & succulent), Crispy Baby Squids (real cripsy and not rubbery at all) and Tofu with Thai Sauce (very appetizing). Service can be a bit slow when the restaurant is packed and it is packed most of the time but who cares when the food is so good..................Although far from town, Hua Yu Wee is located along the main Upper East Coast Road and well served by buses (SBS 14 and 48) to 2 nearby MRT Station (Bedok and Tanah Merah). Getting a cab is also not a problem but for people who drive, there is a problem as parking space is limited (don't worry, just leave your car to the valet..............)
4
Knowing that we are passionate foodies we were taken here by some Singaporean residents who had already pre-ordered the best dishes. Among those were a fabulous black pepper crab which came as a one of largest examples of this edible crustacean that I had ever seen smothered in a very addictive black pepper spicy sauce. Other dishes include butter prawns which were large deep fried prawns, a roasted crispy chicken dish and stir fried venison.The setting is in an old house at what used to be the original edge of the sea. Due to all the land reclamation over the years it is now no longer harbor side but it still retains some of the charm of being in this type of location. With additional seating outside catering for medium to large groups it makes a great location for cracking open a few ice cold beers or bringing your own wine (BYO policy). Highly recommended if you like seafood and/or spicy Singapore flavours. We can't comment on prices as the bill was picked up by our friends before had a chance to take a peek..

In the olden days, Upper East Coast Road was the place to go for seafood as there were a number of seafood restaurants along that road. However, today, only Hua Yu Wee Seafood Restaurant is left along that stretch of road. Situated in an old colonial bungalow, there is indoor air-conditioned seating as well as al fresco sitting in the back. We went there on a Saturday evening and although we were considered early for dinner, we arrived there before 6pm, all the tables indoor were already reserved and we had no choice but to sit at the back which is non air-conditioned.Weather was hot and we would have enjoyed the meal more if it was cooler. Family enjoyed the special signature dish of deboned chicken and black pepper crabs. Food was good on the whole, though service was slightly slow as the restaurant was busy.Though parking is free here, it can be a challenge to find a parking lot when the restaurant is full

Hua Yu Wee is the best place in Singapore for all sorts of crab dishes - chili, black pepper, etc. We had other dishes too, but they did not beat the crab ones, which were outstanding.The location is really far away from town, so the only hope of getting there is by car only. This is a place you go to especially for dinner and nothing else as there are just pricey homes nearby. The restaurant is basically a Chinese-style house with some outdoor sating and limited parking. The service is rushed and rough, as can be imagined from a restaurant that is always crowded with large groups. It is a good idea to order everything in one go or in advance if in a group as it is impossible to get waiter attention after your initial order.Hua Yu Wee is a nice change from the usual joints like Jumbo Seafood and Long Beach, but be prepared to make it the focal point of your evening because of its distance from the city

First of all let me state upfront that I am not Chinese, I am South African, so I am not a connoissure of Chinese Food. Perhaps that is why the reason to eat at this place completely escapes me. The food is nowhere near Jumbo Seafood. In fact I cannot tell the difference between this food and hawker food. High MSG! No atmosphere. Nothing special. I could have paid 10% of the price and not noticed the difference in food

We were at Hua Yu Wee on the eve of Labor Day and understandably, the restaurant was busy.Since we were dining with friends who were visiting Singapore, we had reservations and seated promptly. But when we tried to order, it seemed we were suddenly invisible.The wait staff passed us busily as they attended to Ang Mohs on either side. For them, it seems no request was too small: Ice-bucket for wine – just a moment; extra tissues – oh, here you go; and let me clear these plates away!! All this, while we tried to get one of them to take our order! How do you explain this behavior to your visitors? We saw another table of Indians walk out in disgust, and probably would have done so too but for our visitors. An absolute disgrace!!We have here many times and enjoyed dining here but not likely to go back for awhile. Frankly, it is not worth the aggravation

There are a lot of very good restaurants, but occasionally you just come across a place which is so special that you can never forget the meal. This is one of those places. Very modest in appearance, you know that it is good because it is so busy, both inside and outside. One of our colleagues from Singapore ordered the food, so I guess we were in good hands wi someone who knew what to order. Everything was good, but there were four unforgettable dishes that you should try: chile chicken ( chicken so soft mam not quite sure how they cooked it); sea bass in a very light soy sauce ( very soft consistence and delicate flavour); chilli crab - perfect sauce with a good balance of flavour and spiciness; and finally the highlight: crab fried in batter.... So good i can't describe it... But i know I'll keep the taste and texture in my mouth for a very long time.Can't be missed if you are in Singapor

We have been going to this local restaurant for several years and always make a point of taking western visitors here, as it is the best example of old style Chinese in a traditional original beach side family house, (now a long way from the sea). You need to be recommended, as you would not normally find this place, not least because it is a long way up the east coast. It is predominantly visited by local Chinese and the waiters are not necessarily good at English, but this has never proved a problem. The house is beautiful and I suspect used to have a wonderful garden. We always eat outside. The facilities - tables, chairs, awning - are basic, but there are fans and the occasional air conditioning unit, if you suffer from the heat and humidity. Visit the fish and seafood tanks to see the variety. Tea always comes promptly. One big plus is you can bring your own wine and they supply the glasses. They have Tiger beer in bottles. The food is excellent, especially the crab, sweet and sour prawns and the fish. The tables are of different sizes and we regularly eat at one which copes with 10 to 12 people. Highly recommended

This is one of those restaurants you must be taken to or recommended, as generally you would never come across it unless living here in Singapore. As mentioned in a few other reviews, it probably hasn't changed much in many many years, a good and rare thing in Singapore.We dine here at least once every 2 weeks, the food quality is excellent and the staff are generally attentive, although when busy you may need to be a bit proactive in getting someones attention.The seafood is the specialty, although everything we've ever ordered has been fantastic.Our favorites include:Black Pepper Crayfish - an absolute must if you find the whole crab thing too messy.Vension with Ginger & ShallotsAny of the many prawn optionsand of course the Chilli Crab.Don't wear anything white. And one of the few Singapore restaurants that is BYO with now corkage.Highly recommended, very relaxed environment sit outside definitely and bring friends, allowing you to order more variety

This is an old style seafood restaurant which hasn't changed much since the 1960's. Food is fresh and well prepared. However, service is sloooow and not very courteous. You are served when you manage to attract their attention. Visit armed with loads of patience and time. It is busy at the best of times but the food is good so be prepared to put up with the other negative aspects of this review. Housed in an old fashioned colonial house, it has airconditioned seating as well as an outside seating area. Reservations are a must

In an era of chain/ franchised No Signboards, Jumbos and Long Beachs, this place retains its authentic character and tastes. Housed in a large old fashioned standalone building that might once have faced the sea before land reclamation, with waiters more like aunties and the help yourself to the water style of service, this place is no frills, just good seafood Singapore style. Deep fried baby squid is excellent, and all the other staples, chili crab, black pepper crab, steamed prawns, will satisfy here. For non seafood lovers the duck is not bad

Always a great place for some nice local seafood delicacies. Fresh and reasonably priced . A madhouse on weekends so be there early or make a reservation.

Our long time hidden place for the best pepper crab and cereal prawns! a must try.
looks a bit scary form the outside but the food is amazing!!

If you are looking for a quite dinner in a nice setting this is not the place for you.If you are with a group of friends looking for great food in good company then give this a try. Noisy, busy and bustling it’s a great place for a social gathering – the more the merrier. A wide range of dishes are on offer and it’s best to order communally. Select a range of dishes and tuck in. Chilli crab, prawns, ribs and the crayfish are personal favourites. You can bring you own booze although drinks are available and reasonably priced. A good meal with a few jugs of beer will set you back around S$50 a head. Booking is essential

The place is super old skool and has quite a kampong feel to it. I like the feel of the place with their waitresses in SIA uniforms to the red table cloths.A restuarant within the sprawling compounds of a bungalow admist the private estates. I was shocked to see how many tables the place hold.The kitchen is housed in a separate building and is huge with alot of chefs which explains why the food was served so quickly.What we ordered:-Salted fish fried rice: i like mine slightly saltier- Drunken prawns: yummilicious. Prawns were very fresh in a very flavourful herbal broth. Should have ordered a bigger portion- Fish maw soup: with the vinegar and pepper, you can almost cheat yourself to think this is sharks fins soup :p- Roasted chicken: tender meat but nothing special- Horfun with clams/lala: the cripsy thing on top was a quite combination to the soft horfun. Loved it but was too full to really savour the taste- Fried baby squid: must order! super nice- black pepper crab : quite spicy- chilli crab with mantous: super spic

I went with my family last Sunday to Hua Yu Wee to celebrate my mother's birthday. We had two tables and to make things easier, thus we order the dinner set menu for 8-10 persons. Here are the comments that I would like to highlight:1) we waited half hour for the food to arrive2) the food arrived but all not in order, with the cold dish arrived last after our last dish of fried rice. We waited quite a while for the cold dish and we thought they have forgotten about it3) the spinach with mushroom was not well cooked, as the stem was still very hard and the mushroom tasted raw. We didn't bother to send it back as we didn't want to wait for another half hour again.4) we waited for another half hour for the dessertIn summary, the food is average but the staff could not cope with their work, and the whole place is very disorganized

Old tradition cooking style coupled with old tradition tea and chinese cutlery. You still can find some old stuff within this old colonial house and some history. With the current ridiculous surging price of Sri-lanka crab per kg, Hua Yu Wee offers the most reasonable price without even any service charge. <br><br>Food are greats especially the chilli crab and the yangzhou fried rice. They were generous in giving the char siew meat bites and the gravy for the chilli crab is just too awesome

We go here regularly with friends. Kids can run around out at the back without disturbing other eaters too much. Corkage is free which is a big plus point but most important is the food is fab and reasonably priced. Our favourites are butter prawns ( no shell! ) and the crispy duck ( we bring along our own pancakes) and they will provide sliced spring onions and cucumber so very similar if not better than the crispy duck you get in Chinese restaurants in UK. Sometimes the service can be a bit hit and miss, usually when they are very busy but it's all part of the experience

It's a family-style restaurant, so don't expect a posh setting. Rather, if you didn't manage to reserve one of the few tables in the air-conditioned house, you'll be seated at one of the many round tables in the "backyard", where you look over to patches of wild tropical plants. It's actually kinda fun to sit outdoors, especially on a not-to-warm evening. The service is not top class as well, but quick enough in taking orders and serving. The food is so good that it more than makes up for the lack in ambience and service. The number of guests patronising this place is proof that they are doing things right!We had both the chilli crab and black pepper crab - can't say which one is better, both were yummy. Remember to order the deep fried mantou (bun) to dip into the chilli crab sauce. The crispy mini squids and squid paste in fritters (you tiao sotong) are great there too

One of the first things that strike you is the ambiance of the place. The restaurant is set in an old colonial house, partially restored with white columns and old Chinese tiles. We were there for dinner on 1st February 2012, and took the Lunar New Year menu which comprised of the following dishes: Fatt Choy raw fish; Thick fish mau and crab meat soup; Steamed Rockfish Hong Kong style; Feng Sha chicken; Poached live prawns in Hua Diao wine; Dried oysters with black moss and dried scallop; La La He Fen (rice noodles); Black pepper crabs, and a Desert of warm red beans with stuffed rice balls.The poached prawns were fresh, succulent and sweet, matching well with the dark thick sauce containing sliced chilies. The Rockfish had a firm meat, was well cooked, and went well with the light sauce that was not too salty to taste. The chicken came with a marinate of honey, and was eaten with a green garlic and vinegar paste, which was a deviation from the normal salt and pepper compliment. The skin of the chicken was crispy and the meat, moist. The dried 'oysters' looked, smelled, and tasted like they were mussels and we thought they were! The black moss that came with the dish was a little too strong in ‘medicinal’ flavor. This was the only dish that had leftovers. The black pepper crab that night was not up to standard as the meat was not firm and succulent. The restaurant has other ‘signature‘ dishes, but the dishes we had were on the menu for the Lunar New Year season. The La La He Fen dish of fried flat rice noodles we are told, is many many times better in the regular menu. The waitresses dressed in the Singapore Airlines batik outfits added more local touches to the ambiance, but the noise level in the air-conditioned dining hall was at most times unbearable.The Restaurant is situated at 462 Upper East Coast Road, which is along the main road. On weekends it can be very crowded and parking is a problem although there are valets on duty. It’s better to go on a weekday for your meal. They are opened daily from 5pm to 11.30pm and their phone number is: +65 6442 9313. There is an out door portion to the restaurant in front of the main building for those who prefer fresh air and where the noise levels are probably tolerable.Tip:Instruct the waitress to serve the pepper crabs as the last dish, because after consuming this dish, your taste buds get rather numb and you will not be able to appreciate the flavors of the next and remaining dishes

I guess I have been eating at the Yu Wee for about 6 years- pretty regularly 1 time a month when I am visiting Singapore. I am looking forward to opening my own business in Singapore just so I can make these monthly visits a more regular even in my culinary calendar!Most tourists visit food places either around Clarke/Boat Quay or, if they are seafood buffs, will try the famous seafood centre in the East Coast Park area. Its a pity for them, but more joy for the locals (and me) that places like the Yu Wee remain undiscovered by the visiting hoards. The restaurant itself is located in an old colonial house that, many years ago, was prime beachfront real estate. The reclamation of the East Coast i9n the 1970's and 1980's now means the restaurant is about 200m from the sea. Dinners can enjoy food inside, in air-con comfort, or outside at a table in the huge, red cement garden area. Décor is pretty plain but the cuisine, the quality of and price of the seafood in particular, more than makes up for the diffidence in ambiance. The food is spectacular- both in terms of value and tatse; Can recommend The black pepper crayfish tails (a small portion is 8 tails), The Buttered garlic Prawns without shell (a small portion is 10-12 depending on things), the beef, ginger and spring onion hotplate...infact everything I have tried has been fantastic. A meal for 3, a feat for 3, including 3 tiger beers comes in easily under $100 sing$.Sitting outside is nicest option, enjoying the breeze after about 7pm...inside, in AC comfort, is something to date I have not experienced
