We loved the rose tart in particular both for its aesthetic petal-like curves as well as for its lingering light scent. It wasn't too sweet and wonderfully light in the mouth. Yum

This was my second visit. My two years son likes the sponge cake, soft and not so sweet. Strawberry souffle is a must try.

We had a pot tea with 2 cakes that cost $19.50. The cakes we had were cocao royal and strawberry souffl√©. Soft and light. I preferred the strawberry souffl√©. The place is cozy and nice also. Good place to chat with friends

The coffee was good but oh my, the cakes all just so lovely! I tried the rosey one and it was yummy! The place is also beautiful in a nice area of Chinatown.

I had gone to the cafe on a Sunday afternoon and found the place not too fully packed. The clean and beautiful ambience makes this cafe a relaxing place to chill. We had tried the strawberry souffle and it was delicious and the light taste felt just right

I have not personally ate in this patisserie before but I have many occasions when birthday cakes were bought from here and i have to say, they are amazing in textures and flavours always. They have refurbished the place and it looks bright, clean, and inviting now. Will definitely try one day
