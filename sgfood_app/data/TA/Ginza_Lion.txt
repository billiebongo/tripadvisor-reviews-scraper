Went there for a weekday lunch. Got the chicken lunch special. Food was average. Not too bad. But the service was poor which spoilt the overall experience
5
This place is so cozy! Great food, great service, great dining atmosphere. The experience is outstanding. I recommended this place to everyone.

The restaurant is set on Robertson Quay which is tranquil and has a great atmosphere in which to enjoy a good meal.
We ate wagamama beef, roast beef which was on special and spare ribs. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed their meal.

We arrived with High exceptions, knowing this Japanese chain in other places. However, nothing was simple and gradually became just frustrating to the point of no return.We tried to order the promo beers, 3 bottles for $33...but was informed by the somewhat vacant waitress that all the bottles had to be the same type for some reason - there was only two types to choose from and we wanted to try both to decide on which one we liked better for the third... "Rules are rules" the customer can just suck it.The next was ordering some sides with our main course... the menu has a small section for the sides of "main course" The waitress took the order, but came back to explain there was a 'problem' and we could only order those sides with the Roast beef Main course...not any other main... so trying to get the food we wanted, we just ordered them separately. Then upon arrival of the food, there was fries served with the chicken as well as athe separate portion, leaving us with way too much! I would have appreciated the waitress telling us this as a way to solve their original "problem" especially going through the whole dialogue to explain "its not possible to order"The menus and promos are all over the place and frankly stupid. It felt like we had to argue to place an order and customers were just a pain being there... we had to look around like ostriches and wave anytime we needed them.We also had to wait an age to get the credit card back after payment when we just wanted to get out of there fast!I'd recommend going to the place across the street instead

We only had a couple of days in Singapore and were less than impressed with the quality of the service we experienced generally until we stopped for dinner and drinks at Ginza Lion by the river at Robertson Quay. Our waiter, Jose, hands down, provided us with the best service of our trip and the unlimited beer for 90 minutes that was the cherry on top. He was attentive but not intrusive and was happy to make recommendations. Next time in Singapore this will be our first stop
3
If only for the beer (their draft beer served really nice and cold), I'd give them 4 stars, but the mediocre food brings this down a notch. I got the steak and the best part about it was the mayo mentiako that came with the fries (when the sauce that comes with your side is the best part of the meal, you know the food can't be that good).
4
It's always been a relaxing place to have dinner and drinks. After a long flight i really enjoyed the pasta and the peach beer. The stratosphere was pub-like but not that noisy. They have some of the best beers with a fruity flavour. The pasta was a bit oily for my liking though. Could be better.

Beware what you think you are paying for, a free flow session of wine and beer, a beer 'O' clock session or just outrageously expensive drinks.Thinking our bill was going to be a maximum of $56 each, five people equals $280, we ended up paying $645. Please be sure you know what your getting

ステーキを私はミディアムレア夫はミディアムでオーダーしたにも関わらず、私のがウェルダン、夫のがミディアムレアできました。長く待たされた上、ステーキは完全に冷めきっていて当然美味しくありませんでした。スタッフに数回確認しましたが声が小さくごもごもと喋るので何を言ってるのか聞き取れませんでした。I've ordered steak medium rare and my husband ordered medium but somehow mine was served well done and husband's one medium rare.We waited so long, when was served steak was completely cold.We checked staff several times, her voice was so soft and mumbling couldn't cache a word
5
My beer-loving friend suggested that we both checked out this beer hall and I was aghast since I don't drink beer! But being a good sport, I agreed...and it was absolutely "no regrets, man!"We ordered to share...the signature Angus beef steak with add on fries, the Honey pork ribs and fried chicken wings. All exceeded our expectations!!For drinks, my friend had 3 mugs of Sapporo Premium Beer while I enjoyed a bottle of vintage cider!Service was prompt & friendly too
4
Nice place and easy for everyone to go. Service was good and the staff there are friendly. Food was good and delicious! Big space to hold family gathering or party.
4
3 of us had good meal ... service was quick. Menu had plenty of options for sharing platters ... possibly limited for classic main meal choices though. The food was tasty ... beer was good too!
4
Ideal place to have a beer with friends after work. The food was oishii yet pricey. Gorgeous and friendly staff.
5
Food was yummilicious, service staff are friendly, attentive and very helpful too! A great place to chill, catch up with friends over great food & beer!
5
You know a place serves up good authentic food renditions when you see Japanese expats dining here.While it is not your typical Japanese restaurant, it serves up a very nice fusion of Japanese and Western/European fare. Their roast beef is a must have! Also thoroughly enjoyed their Nachos with Melted Cheese.Also their Sapporo beers on draught are premium quality, one of my favourite places for a good Japanese beer. If you're adventurous, order a beer in their boot glass!The happy hour deals for beer are also fantastic in my opinion
2
This place was recommended as it is supposed to be a popular Japanese restaurant chain. First place I have ever been to that I honestly could not choose 1 item on the menu that I wanted to eat. The place is all about all you can drink Japanese beer in two hours with essentially an all over the place choice of bar food with no focus on any particular type of cuisine ... and no Japanese. Skip this place in a city with much greater choices in restaurant
5
I'm here now sitting down at Ginza lion enjoying a Sapporo Beer for S$4.90 and their buffet platter. The roast beef is well roasted and and their signature dish, the Rosu Katsu is simply melt-in-the-mouth Heavenly! The buffet goes for 39.50++ but is well worth the money.
4
Group of 10 of us pre drinks and dinner before Santana, the pizza was actually good so was the fried wings , but the ceasar salad was pretty unusual as the lettuces came in big chunks dripped too little with the cream sauces and crutons was minimal. The beer as always was good, we had the table right at the door, the seating was comfortable enough on bar stool and table and the decor is very tastful with high ceiling which lends an elegant atmosphere
4
Ginza Lion great place for good selection of beers and wines, and for $50 for all you can eat and unlimited booze for two hours, well that is worthwhile! Lovely atmosphere.Food quality and presentation and the taste of the dishes impeccable. The service staff were friendly and thoughtful, making our dining experience a memorable one. Definitely a must try, I will be back very sooon
4
Dropped in for an evening meal before heading home to London. Mug of beer cost S$9 and ribs over S$20 although, it must be said, this is pretty much in line with many Singapore riverside restuarants. Pleasent staff and food tasted very nice.We were blessed with a nice evening so sitting out near the river was a pleasure
4
Very cosy seats. Great Sapporo beer. Good chicken, pork and beef dishes. And also great tonkatsu dishes from Tonkichi. Mainly fried or BBQ dishes but goes so well with beer. Service is good and fast. Environment is very good. Prices very reasonable. Will come back.
3
Only had drinks, but 2 beers in happy hour cost £25. Nice bar and the food others were eating looked good, but far from cheap. For tourists, beware the 2 taxes added that are not advertised on the price list.
4
Went with a party of 8 adults and 2 children. Food was good although kitchen was a little slow. What's commendable was the service staff who were friendly and attentive.
4
Another place where the beer is really good and the prices are good during happy hour. Did not eat here this time but the food that we saw looked good and there did not seem to be much left on the plates going back.
5
Tried the mango infused beer and it was really good ! Also had a soft shell crab spaghetti which was perfect. I sat outdoors close to the river and the atmosphere was very relaxing. The staff was very courteous as well
1
Service was bad. Only the bill arrive promptly. Even that the staff are confused by the various promotion.
The free dining vouchers have too many hidden class.
I would suggest to stay away. Many other better restaurant around .
No craft beer are available

See photos.
Overall, decent.
Note : 50%off selected wine after 830pm. Works out $28 for cheapest bottle.

Despite the above average ratings in TripAdvisor, we were the only customers on a Friday lunch hour. We ordered their black angus roast beef, butter wine clams, salmon & draft beer. Service was almost non existent although the number staff outnumbered us. The staff forgot my beer. The beef was roasted to an inner pink but parts of it were well done. I ate it as it is without the cold, oily ponzu flavoured sauce, this strange sauce tasted medicinal & bleh. The clams were slightly overcooked & the mussels did not excite. In fact, the accompanying crackling baguette & butter were more tasty. Overall no wow factor.

This is a Japanese style restaurant without sashimi or sushi serving. Saw quite a no. of tables ordered tempura...Environment is fine. There is no option to choose steak raw level. All are medium by default. However, the outcome is definitely not right. There is still blood. This is unprofessional. Wasabi and sesame source is brilliant. The waiter was criticising why we were late although there were still quite a no. of empty tables. If you were not planning to help your customers in traffic jam why you ask...Food is generally good. Just didn't feel much Japanese style
4
We arrived around 2 pm on a weekday and the restaurant was mainly empty except for two tables. We were dining at the Tonkichi and by the time our order arrived, we had the restaurant to ourselves. Staff were attentive, though we're the only ones, they're still very quick to respond. We had the tonkatsus and they're tender, not dry, good proportions. You can ask for extra rice or the shredded cabbages without additional charges. There are many Japanese restaurants in the complex so if I'm asked whether I will return again, probably not so soon. Price wise a bit steep for casual dining (as what we were doing)
4
Had Tonkatsu at their Toonkichi section. The meats were almost as good as those we tried in Japan. We also liked the burdock so much we had seconds.
3
This restaurant serves food portion large enough for feeding a pack of lions. The food is good, but you can easily share :-)
4
This bar is not bad at all and they do a good free flow for 2 hour deal which includes lots of food and wine and bear. Nice atmosphere and good location .
5
Restaurant service is a TOTAL SURPRISE in Singapore and mind you, this is probably a $$ level restaurant . I have been here for 5 times...You must literally pop a champagne when you experience good service in Singapore !!! At this place, every staff is consistent -credit to the Japanese management (Omotenashii !!) My daughter is feeling sick and waitress Jenny came asking if she wants a hot lemon honey water !!! Free of charge.Martin ( he was so good I thought he was the owner !! ) is ever attentive overall , from food , but drinks, sharing the value deal Etc... We really enjoy his kind, sincerity ! He brought my sick daughter warm water too and making sure is not "hot" but warm.....LOL ( he is not my relative ) Food is comparable to Japanese standard - made passionately with love ! Is in the taste ! Tks again . We ate at hundreds of restaurants in Japan and this is the only in SINGAPORE comparable in taste and price ! See the photos ! 5 beers lots of food for 2 Adults 3 pre teen kids =SGD 190 **beer is $10 each Come before 8pm of happy hours price.

When shopping in the Suntec City mall look for Ginza Lion Restaurant and Bar. I recommend the Mango beer and the wife was very happy with the house sav Blanc. We ordered the lunch specials of pan fried chicken and pan fried fish which arrived in a timely manner and the plates were clean when they were taken back. The food and service here is great
3
We went to this place after late lunch on last Saturday. The Happy hour promotion for Draft Sapporo was 8$++ per mug which quite small and not more than 385 ml. But it was cold and taste nice. / House Red Wine by glass was served warm which Not what I expected, better to serve it in right temperature @15-17 degrees. But the taste was nice and generous poured. The service was decent.
5
Just off Robertson Quay, along the Singapore River. Bar and restaurant managed by a Japanese gentleman who runs a great team of attentive and courteous servers.Extensive bar with most drinks available including wines and sakes. Food selection is also excellent... favorite of my daughter is the pasta carbonara.Am there once to twice a month without fail

Recently, I am on the hunt for the best place to get Happy Hour Promotions for beers. I have tried several other places which was good as well, but when I have tried Ginza Lion, I have settled here to get my Happy Hour cravings. I have never moved on to the next venue. ^_^They got variety of beers to choose from and they are all priced decently. Firstly, Singapore is not a place for cheap drinks, and so I find that this place offers good enough prices for happy hour. There are actually some other places that charges more than this place. Please do note that service charges and taxes are not applied yet on the prices they are showing on the boards or menu (as other restos/bars would also do). Having an option to have the beer served in a glass boot is a novelty.The food is great as well! It is more like Japanese-Western Fusion than just Japanese themed. I could highly recommend the Roasted Black Angus Beef. Cooked perfectly, well seasoned, and comes with freshly grated wasabi (real wasabi and not the paste kind). Their Fried Chicken/Chicken Wings is great as well. And all on the menu are priced decently and reasonably. Total value for money!The service is good. They actually serve your orders quite fast. Managers and Staff are friendly and accomodating. They also gives out vouchers or discount coupons for your next visit (as a way of promotions so you would keep coming back, and I did!).I have visited both outlets at Rodyk/Robertson Quay & Suntec and I have experienced the same great experience on each visit. I am frequenting the Suntec outlet for convenience and accessibility to MRT though, a great place to have good food and drink after a long day at work, but Rodyk is the place if you wanted some quiet nights drinking beer overlooking Singapore river

this is not the place u wanna go if u don't want your evening to be ruined by the end of the day. we friends gather there for some fun n staff tried to sell us the expensive stuff n then when it came to bill the calculations were not right n they are not willing to accept their mistake either.save your money n day

Avoid going to this place. Let me make this clear. Avoid going to this place unless you want to be scammed by the the waiters and waitresses here. If you think this is the same level of polite service you get at the Ginza lion in Tokyo, then turn your back away and find another place to eat or drink because this is not. From the start the waiters were trying to sell us the expensive stuff on the menu, even though it was still happy hour. I cannot believe that a well known brand like the Ginza lion associates itself with terrible service that we experienced. Maybe it is just this branch at Suntec city, but please avoid going to the this place unless you want to have the feeling that you have been scammed at the end of your meal. Terrible staff, terrible service, terrible ethics, terrible everythin

Had lots of beer to choose from and a good selection of food. Happy hour until 2000 hours (8 PM) an hour longer than most places. Prices where good for Singapore...
5
Really nice little restaurant / bar on the Singapore river opposite the Riverview Hotel. Friendly and attentive staff. We had a very good lunch there recently and would recommend.

Chicken&cheese sausage is always my favorite.Try their mouth watering sausage is a must do.
4
Singapore is not cheap. But this please has decent beer specials and some amazing fried chicken. Stop off for a beer boot!

I imagined myself strolling into this beer hall after a tiring or stressful day at work and sitting down alone in front of the beer counter. I have with me a glass of red wine and a plate of the signature roasted black angus beef. Mmm...this is life. A simple meal in solidarity but this is what I would like to do sometimes. The medium-done beef radiated in reddish pink glow, incredibly soft but not losing its meat texture. I took the second serving, dabbed it into the shoyu sauce, bits of freshly grated wasabi and it is another realm of enjoyment. Full review and pics on http://dairycream.blogspot.sg

Firstly you should note that there are three Ginza Lion outlets in Singapore – one in Suntec City Mall, one in Rodyk Street near Robertson Quay (which is the one shown on the TA location map), and one among those that line the riverside at Robertson Quay. It seems that reviews for all three appear under this single heading, so bear that in mind if taking notes from reviews.This review, like several others, is for the relatively new restaurant on the riverside at Robertson Quay, and for reasons that will become clear my low rating is for the place as a bar only as we did not try the food.It is predominantly a Japanese restaurant, complete with young Japanese ladies in hot pants serving, and pleasantly situated by the river, where you can sit outside overlooking the water. We decided to have a beer during Happy Hour to consider whether to eat there or not, particularly as a chalk board at the back was inscribed ‘Happy Hour – Sapporo beer $10 per pt gls’ (which I assumed meant per pint glass). I ordered two beers. When they arrived they were not pints but smaller glasses, so I queried this with the waitress. She produced a menu which showed happy hour prices at $8.50 for 330cl. By my reckoning that is about $14.50 per pint - considerably more than the $10 advertised on the chalk board - but rather than make a fuss I accepted it. However, when the bill came it was charged at $10 per glass. When I queried it the waitress said that the price on the menu did not include a service charge (10%) or tax (which she somehow omitted to mention when she pointed out the menu price following my earlier query about the advertised board price). Therefore I ended up paying $10 (£5) for 330 cl (a little over half pint) when the chalkboard offered a pint for $10. I felt this was a deliberately misleading tourist rip-off, compounded when the waitress failed to explain the menu prices were exclusive of a service charge and tax when I had queried the price, so we did not stay. Therefore what the food was like I cannot say, but the deceitful practice of luring customers in with false advertising left a nasty taste. So be warned if you only want to sit there with a beer

Stumbled into this new outlet at Suntec City and decided to give it a try. Nice Atmosphere, comfortable setting. Ordered grilled chicken and truffle fries and beer. Food served was hot and equally great. Served with nice cold beer, really made the meal very good. Good place to chill out and talk and have a meal
4
We stumbled into this area which is a bit further than the normal Muhammad Sultan area. It is quieter and certainly a very nice area. singapore river was running in front and across was a recently spruced up warehouse. It was a cool and balmy evening and this is the perfect place to relax with a couple of cold beers after a hard day at work. We were expecting normal bar food which it is but it was delicious especially the fried chicken with the peppery seasoning. The co-owner and waitresses were very nice and afterwards he even gave us free tirimusa. All in all we really enjoyed ourselves .
5
The one thing that stands out is the exceptionally friendly service by the girls. They are very professional yet remain calm & friendly even during a full house. The spread is mainly conti with a good proportion of German dishes (try the sausage platter). The pricing is not over the top, definitely worth a visit when at Robertson Quay
4
Located along the RiverView in Singapore that is dotted with fancy restaurants and bars, this one got my attention because of the choice of beers.Friendly staff, probably a little too talkative.The food is a mix of Italian American and a good collection of wines and spirits.Definitely worth a visit
