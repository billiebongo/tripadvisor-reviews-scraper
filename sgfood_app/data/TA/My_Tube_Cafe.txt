Came here few times and did not disappoint me. The food was delicious, unlike some other cafes where their pastas taste so bland. Service was great. Even asked for feedback on the food.

you will feel at home upon stepping into My Tube CafÃ©. A piano on the left played the chef when he is in the mood. you will be lucky if he is playing a song. and even luckier if he is singing to the crowds.the food variety is good. from sandwiches to spaghetti.. their signature MONSTER sandwich will challenge yourself to a big delicious meal. highly recommended for brunch. if you are not looking forward to main course, they have varieties of cakes, I have tired their green tea cheese cake and classic cheesecake.they seem to have new flavours of cheese cake every month
