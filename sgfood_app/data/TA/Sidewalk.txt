The food is delicious, served hote, cheap and fast. The drinks are cheap, fast and COLD! The outside looks not so good, but take a step in side and you will not be sorry. We visit here every year and will always come back.

third visit and hasn't disappointed. Small number of food stalls within the interior and all offer a good selection.
we opted for the Char kway teo, again, and plenty of it served and very tasty. cheaply priced and we think excellent value

If you are staying at peninsula excelsior hotel or near there this place is just around the corner. Cheap beer and good food for a nice price! The atmosphere is welcoming and nice service. It's just like the local bar/restaurant!

This was our "local" in Singapore, located around the corner from our hotel. We didn't eat there but it was very popular with the locals. Large bottles of Tiger beer for $6.50 kept us coming back for more !!!

We ate here a bit as we stayed close by. The food is nice and cheap and tasty $ 3 to $4. Nice cold beer and other cold juices. The coffee and tea is also very good. It gets busy at night with men eating and drinking outside but dont be put off. It is very friendly and usually more families eating inside

We eat in "Tian xin wanton noodle" and the food was very good. Simple, but tasty!You can choose what you want to put in your soup, and how to eat easily.We have all these food for only 9$, so it was super cheap!We like the dumplings, it was a good choice!And also, the service was nice, and people very polite.To conclude, the whole place is nice, with a good atmosphere.Go there

A simple storefront, with food from the region and cheap everything. You can't go wrong here. The beer lady is fast and efficient. The food is good and quick too. If you need something to fit a tight budget or just wish to rest your feet from the endless walks, rest here

this little place was close to our Hotel so dropped by one evening. there are a number of vendors within and we took our cue by following the queues. some stalls were quiet and two had long queues which we guessed meant the food here was great.food was excellent and portion sizes massive! I have a good appetite and just managed to finish my dish. Beer reasonably priced as well

The location in trip advisor is wrong, it's directly opposite the fire station. Same block as Peninsula Hotel.This is a basic local food market. Don't expect an up market cafe or restaurant. But it does have air conditioning. :)9 shops offering a variety of meals. From local dishes including soups, noodles, dumplings, seafood and even one up the back offering western food like Carbonara, fried chicken, backhoes, fish and chips etc.Very friendly to tourists, oh good juice and beer and all at amazing prices. I'd $6 for a main meal and $7 for a beer.Suggest you try the fried or steamed dumplings, BBQ prawns

Thirty years ago the Satay Club was the open air food market and "the" place to go for local food. Prosperity and dvelopment has seen such places disappear. When travelling we believe a part of the adventure is to enjoy good local cusine. We were going to visit Telk Ayre Market (Lau Pa Sat) but circumstances prevented this. We discovered a food marlket close to our hotel ( the Peninsular Excelsior in Coleman St) in Hill Street which had about seven food vendors offering a wide choice of local food cooked while you wait. Dining is done in the central court surrounded by the vendors. Bench tables and chairs are simple but effective. The place has a certain "buzz" with many locals dining and lots of activity in the various kitchens. The premises were clean. Food arrived quickly and was of good quality with great flavours. Prices were extremely reasonsble. We feel this was a great find and suggest anyone wanting to enjoy good local food to give ths a try

We were staying near Sidewalk and found it while out shopping. Several different food vendors in the one building with a central sitting area (food court style). Cheap and freshly cooked meals which were tasty with plenty of options. Beer was cheap.

This restaurant is obviously well-liked by the locals as it is always well patronised but our taste buds were' acclimatised to the local dishes. It seemed very cheap and very good portions per serving.

Decent people, decent meal... We arrived Singapore on a Thursday and wandered to this place which was just round the corner of our Hotel. As we were looking for something Vegetarian (because of the Thursday) , one of the attendants politely refused to serve us, as her utensils must have been mixed with the non- veg fare. HONESTY... Returned back next day only to decide to have all our dinners there. Simply awesome food. Home style chicken, pork wow. Dumplings are mouth watering. The place is food court styled, having quite a few stalls selling various dishes and Tiger Beer. Frequented by locals in large numbers too. So the place is quite value for money

We passed this place many times going to our hotel until we finally tried it out. The food is excellent, can highly recommend the teriyaki chicken, prices are good and it's fun to sit and watch people.Nowadays we stop every day even if it's only for a Kopi Peng (ice coffee). What a little gem, love i

We were staying around the corner from here and decided we wanted to eat at hawkers markets as much as possible, we stumbled upon this place quite by accident whilst very jet lagged and hungry. The chap running the stall in the top left hand corner was such a friendly man and knocked us up the most fantastic rice and meat I've ever had despite him being about to close for the night. Add to that a couple of beers and that was how we spent our first and last night in Singapore at Sidewalk. The view of the fire station is quite lovely if you can get a seat outside and then sit back and take it all in. The sellers are very friendly from what we experienced and the place is clearly very very popular with the locals which is always a good sign, so much better than China Town Food Street which is a let down in comparison. Just be prepared for some very different food options to the UK on some of the stands such as pigs stomach and trotters and various other organs! Interesting reading but I wasn't brave enough to partake...

We discovered this place while staying in a nearby hotel. Its inside with some pavement tables. There are various vendors who cook foods from around the far east and you can mix and match as you like. There were two of us and we had a nice main course each and shared a large Tiger beer all for 13 Singapore Dollars

Well this place is a gem for someone who loves a beer even a bite to eat Asian style...750 mil bottle of Heineken and other varieties in a bucket off ice with a glass with a handle for $7.60 ..most hotels around here are $15 for 375 mill. Can off coke $1.40. ...If you don't mind being outside its ok...as seats inside go quick with air-conditionin

Delicious and quick. I ate here after reading some reviews. The range of food was great. I ordered some fried dumplings and they were made to order so arrived fresh and hot. I just had to keep an eye on the stall as they ring when the food is ready and you get up and get it yourself. It was a Saturday night but I still managed to find a place to sit. A large bottle of Tiger beer was cheaper than a glass of beer from a regular restaurant.

Great place to have some local foods anytime of the day. We went for breakfast every other day and for a night snack a couple other times. Try the kopi (coffee), soy bean milk, fresh fruits, Stir fried egg noodles and bee hoon with your choice of various Chinese sausages and rolls. The nasi lemak at the corner store is a must. The best I've had in Singapore at S$1.50!!! I would avoid dinner and evenings as it turns into a beer garden of sorts and kind of rowdy, unless that's your kind of thing
