For the past year, we have throughly enjoyed this gem. Our favorites being Xiao Long bao, wanton in chili and Dan Dan noodle. They never disappoint.For the price, you get the maximum bang for buck.Quite many PRCs patronise this stall, probably staking itâ€™s claim of authenticity. Highly recommended.

We discovered this little gem on our first visit. The Xiao Long Bao was juicy and flavorful. The Wo-Tie and Wanton in chili oil were also excellent. Dan dan mian had a rich broth and surprisingly good too. Prices were reasonable for the quality offered. A delightful find.
