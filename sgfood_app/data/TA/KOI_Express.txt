My favorite from this place is the black tea machiato. Canâ€™t help my self to get a big one when passing any Koi outlet. Deliciously addictive !!

I can say that the beverages this cafe offers really blew my mind. I thought Starbucks was second to none, but KOI gave me a new perspective of coffee and teas. I would certainly get another cup (or two) the next time I visit Singapore!

The downside of this branch is that you can't use your koi card and it doesn't make any sense. Koi should look into providing alternatives for their loyal customers.

Good place to chilli. Fast to serve drink that I want. Not long queue but crowd with people. Waiting time to collect my drink about 5 minutes.

The best Oolong Machiato offer by KOI ! I can also earn points when I purchase $10 shared w my friends at changi airport T3 ^^

Best bubble tea in Singapore. Many outlets islandwide, with afgordable prices. Try out the chocolate milk tea, it is very good.

While the taste is fairly consistent being a bubble tea franchise, the wait time in unacceptably long. Having drank koi from multiple outlets, this has got to be the longest wait we have ever encountered. The bell rang about every minute, whereas in comparison other outlets would ring every tens of seconds

I buy the Green Milk Tea with Golden Bubble and very satisfied. Even the golden bubble not as sweet as the bubble in Indonesia, their bubble are smaller, more chewy with interesting color.These shop bring you an express service time, and can be a good choice if you want to find bubble drinks in Singapor
