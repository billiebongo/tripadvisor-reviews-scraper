Night out with friends
We stopped st s few bars and ended here
The food was modern Mexican and simply said the best Mexican I’ve had in a long time
Fresh flavours
Great portions
Good price
A great place in a wonderful part of town
4
They have a decent happy hour on wine and the homemade guacamole we had was delicious - although a quite small serving for the price. Great place to sit and watch the world go by on eclectic Haji lane.
4
Food was yummy - quesadillas, meat and veggie ! Super friendly staff too and not too expensive ! Will definitely come back
4
Singapore is not know for its Mexican food. This restaurant does not compare with the food in Central America, but you have to remember that you are in Singapore. The restaurant offers a nice alternative to the usual Singapore offerings.
5
Every time I go to Singapore. I will visit this cafe. In front of the cafe they have paintings which one of the best tourist attraction for taking pictures. The workers are friendly and interactive.
3
Fun atmosphere to have a drink with friends!! The food was just average I was disappointed in the guacamole as it was nothing special.
4
We were recommend this by our hotel - I was a little reluctant to go to a Mexican whilst in Singapore but should not have worried. Really good tasty food, reasonably priced and some great cocktails. We tried several dishes and they were all good - the sea food tacos were great. Certainly did not feel any pain after the second or third margarita?? There are lots of places in eat in the area but this restaurant is defiantely worth a visit. Nice and relaxed - friendly atmosphere, seems popualar with the locals

Came for first time for dinner. Came cuz it had decent reviews. Cool/quirky decor inside restaurant. Indoor + outdoor seating available.Wasn't busy when arrived....got busier as I left..I ordered Mocktail Sangria...decent taste to it.Ordered Chicken enchiladas...come 3 in plate. Big portion. I asked the waitress is they can do red sauce for enchiladas as menu stated green and she had NO idea what I meant and went to grab "hot sauce." I said no that's not "red sauce used with enchiladas." So I ordered it as is.Most Mexican restaurant they serve chips n Salsa when dining at a restaurant. This place did not AND IF you did want it it was pricy along with the guacamole. Food took too quick to come out. So not sure how fresh or how prepared because it was less than 5 mins that I got my food. Wasn't super hot in temperature either.I'd come back again and try another dish
4
Chanced upon this place. Did not realise it's a popular venue.. Came for lunch ...Believe it's a vibrant spot for dinner and drinks.. Good food ,great variety, and love the ambience..Must say they do play some good music too.If you are tourist would highly recommend a visit.Situated at the Arab street tourist belt.
5
Was a Piedra Negra for lovely Mexican food & margaritas with a girlfriend & 2 young kids. My kids do not usually like al fresco seating due to the tropical heat, but as this street is so colourful & vibrant plus there are no direct exposure to sun, it was surprisingly cooling, thoroughly enjoyed the good food & margaritas (which started serving only at 3pm)Must check out if you are in this vicinity
5
Lots of energy in this restaurant. Service was great in spite of the busy night. Food was great. Margarita was absolute yum!
Lovely location too.
5
Had an awesome night with quesadilla and burritos! The ambience was great, drinks and service were great too! Definitely going back again!
4
Very lively place in the evening, with a great selection of latin food. Service is good.
Of course this is in Singapore, so the prices are not cheap, but not too bad for the location.
Would certainly visit again.
5
Had a blast on my birthday! Thanks to Anuj, events manager, who arranged everything. It was a stress-free party. I don't need to think about anything but have fun & enjoy. Thank you also to Manjeet, floor manager. He made sure all our needs were addressed. Lastly, the food was so delicious. My guests kept saying that everything tasted so great. Again, Thank you so much for making my birthday truly memorable! I hope to celebrate my party or any events there soon!
4
Love the rustic feel of the place and the outdoor areas. It's like you're not even in singapore. The service is good and the food is quite impressive. The guacamole is one of the best I've had because it's so fresh and the come to the table and mash it infront of you so the experience is great to share on social media
5
Good food, good price, and good place location. We were looking for a Mexican place around Bugis and we ended up in Piedra Negra near Haji Lane.The place has a good vibe in it. Lots of tourists - adults and kids. We were there at around 8pm and the crowd was just slowly building up. We were seated outdoors as the indoor - air-conditioned room is already full. Service was prompt. We were served water as we seated and the food arrived promptly after we have ordered. We ordered tacos, quesadillas and nachos with guacamole (they make the guacamole on your table) for 2 persons. It is pretty good. We would defo come back and dine again.
4
Nestled in Haji Lane, perhaps the quirkiest street in Singapore, sits Piedra Negra. A well equipped Mexican menu, and the enchiladas come well recommended. Nachos tasty too, even if they do get a little excited with the aubergine/sweetcorn!Recommended spot for a chilled out meal at a reasonable price
4
Funky place and most enjoyable dining experience. Sat outside in the laneway, service good and food is exactly what we expected. Didn't find the prices expensive like some have mentioned, it's what you expect in Singapore. Enjoyed the Nachos and Burritos. Stayed at The Pan Pacific Service Suits so a very handy spot as only 5 mins walk across the road.
4
The colorful decoration of this Mexican restaurant was interesting and original, based on red-maroon painting. The atmosphere was friendly and youthful with both tables and high-chairs. The Mexican food was tasty. Only the sangria was average and clearly overpriced and that was the only drawback that I found in visiting this place
4
Just stopped in for a drink and ordered the guacamole and the guy wanders by the table with a mortar and pestle and starts making it in front of us. Incredible.The place had a funky feel and the full meals that were coming out looked amazing
4
Lot of buzz and activity here. Food was above average but not great. Liked the Chili Relenos, a dish I haven't easily been able to find here on Singapore. Food was cooked and served quickly.
4
Came here for dinner and ended up staying for quite a few drinks. It's in a great area and has a decent selection of drinks and good food.
3
Food is good. One portion is quite filling for one person. Don't order laksa, you have to dig in soup to look for seafood, still it's not there.
4
I was lured in by the promise of guacamole made fresh at the table. I was not disappointed- the guacamole is great, the corn chips are made in house & lacked a little seasoning but otherwise good. We shared the chicken nachos - came topped with cheese, sour cream and jalapeÃ±os. Would be perfect if there was more chicken in the dish & some form of salsa/tomato was added for freshness. Will have to go back to try the margaritas (looked good but we didn't have any alcoholic beverages so can't comment on the taste). The restaurant seems quite popular. Prices are mid-range (for Singapore).
5
My wife and I were wanting a quick snack when we stumbled across a German family eating a delicious Guacamole out the front of Piedra Negra. I asked what it was like and they replied DELICIOUS, and they make it fresh at your table in front of you.That was enough, and we took a seat and ordered the same plus a fresh orange juice.The Guacamole and corn chips were awesome and the orange juice as nice as I've had.Would love to come back for dinner, but don't think time will permit unfortunately.It isn't cheap but, we paid $17
4
We ate lunch here in the early afternoon. I think that was a perfect choice - it was easy to get a table, and we're not night entertainment people. The guacamole is just as great as described in other reviews, so order that! The food is excellent in general. Not cheap, but worth the money
4
Let me tell you, if you are planning to be here on weekends better reserve place well in advance to avoid waiting, this place will be crowded all the weekend (not sure about weekdays as all times i visited either on Friday or Saturday, Menu includes GUACAMOLE (freshly made at your table), another star dish in starters is potato fries served piping hot and with different looking.. Also had some really good chicken enchiladas made with a very hot and tasty green sauce
4
My husband and I ate here based on the reviews we found on Trip Advisor and they were spot on. We enjoyed the guacamole which was prepared table side and served with corn chips. The smoked margarita was very tasty and the drink got its smoke flavor from the smoked salt that lined the rim of the glass. My husband had the tacos which were meat filled soft taco shells that were rolled up then deep fried and covered with shredded lettuce, onion, tomato and quest blanco. They were a bit dry, and different than what I had expected, but very tasty. I had the beef fajitas but were not lured as fajitas (#24). These were yummy. . Big chunks of tender beef with peppers, onions and cheese covered in cheese served with soft tortillas. Watch out for the red chili paste it is served with if you do not like spicy hot condiments!!! Price was it was reasonable by Singapore standard. We had to make several attempts to get a servers attention but once we did service was efficient and friendly. The atmosphere was casual. The decor could be refreshed. Overall, it was a very tasty meal and pleasant time.
4
After some shopping in Haji Lane, this was a nice stop as it borders Haji and the main road to pick up a taxi. The food is very good!! Its more tex mex in my mind than Mexican, but that doesn't matter. Its tasty, spiced right and plentiful. (make sure to ask how spicy as one person I was dining with found it overall spicy but I loved mine). The atmosphere is very cool and quirky and a great place to hang out, sip margaritas and watch the world go by. Service was also good when I was there. They have a live DJ sometimes as they were setting up just as we were leaving. Will defiantly be back. If you go later at night I might suggest reservations as I noticed a lot of tables were reserved
5
I've been twice to SuperLoco (overpriced and overhyped) and ChaChaCha (cheap but so so overall) in Holland Village. This one beats them easy. The food is delicious and well sized. The 2 times I was here I got Beef Burrito, that came with side of sauces and some waffle fries.Drinks are good and good in amount of alcohol as well. Sangria is nice also.Nice atmosphere, large enough (has 2 areas) so you get enough privacy. Try to stay on the outside area if the loud noises bother you. One of my favorite outings in Singapore.We ordered at about 9.15 pm, kitchen remained open past 10 pm and they asked us to leave at about 11+ pm
5
Excellent option to taste authentic Mexican food, and drink a frozen Corona little part of México in Singapore.
5
Amazing atmosphere. Good food. Large variety of drinks and beer. The food arrived quickly. Staff was maybe a bit slow but not actually a problem.
4
Had the guac as well as the mango ceviche. Very tasty and fresh. The singapore slings were well balanced. Would recommend the place for a casual double date
4
Pretty decent Mexican food. I'm from SoCal and have been craving Mexican food in Asia and this place hit the spot. Good nachos, burritos, etc. cute atmosphere and pretty decent service. Would recommend !!
4
Only went here for drinks, in fact our first visit was to get relief from the sun. On our second visit the waitress remembered us which is always a good sign. It's a laid back place and very friendly and a couple of pints of Tiger went down very well. It was quiet at lunchtime and early evening but was getting very busy later on
5
We went here for dinner and it did not disappoint. The food and drinks are extremely reasonably priced (compared to most places in Singapore) and the service is relatively attentive.The restaurant itself sprawls out along the start of Haji Ln where it meets Beach Rd. As such there are a few different doors that you can enter through. The staff are helpful to point you in the right direction.The place is beautifully decorated both inside and out. The artwork on the external wall is especially striking.They have a decent range of cocktails and the usual beers for Singapore (Tiger) as well as Corona and Sol and a few others.The food is great. We had guacamole (made at the table with avocado, onion, chili, tomato and lime juice in a mortar and pestle) and the corn with queso as starters and both were delicious.For mains we had the quesadillas (pulled beef was amazing) and the chicken enchiladas (comes as serving of 3). The salsa on the enchiladas was spicy and super enjoyable. We were both stuffed by the end and had no room for dessert but they did have a fairly good choice of these too.The quality and authenticity of the food (not just for Singapore) was fantastic. I'd recommend this place to anyone who like Mexican in a relaxed and friendly atmosphere
4
I love going to this restaurant for quick and tasty Mexican food. It's on a very lively street with cafes and bars all around. The restaurant itself has a very colorful and lively decor. Staff is courteous, service is fast and food is good. Pretty much everything you want !!!Really like their criss cross fries with dip though the jalapeno poppers were a bummer :
5
Visited with friends on a friday evening around 5. The happy atmosphere started setting in around 7. Service was good and food was delicious and fresh. We tried veg and chicken quessadillas, red snapper fish with mango salad, criss cross fries. Jalapenos poppers were pretty spicy but ok. We ordered mocktails and cocktails to set the mood and whatever we ordered was so tropically flavorful and yummy. Music was superb and ambience was perfect for the evening
4
Piedra negra is right on the corner of haji lane, a busy place street full of bars with a lively atmosphere. The service was very good and the staff cant do enough to help. Food was also very good. There is a wide range on offer from a light stack to a hearty meal. Plenty choice. As this is a Mexican there are also plenty dishes which cater for people which don't like spicy foo
5
Went here for a family dinner and loved this place, perfect for a family get together. The service was excellent, margaritas were made perfectly and price reasonable. I had the vegetarian nachos which was very yummy. Everyone I was with loved their food too. Would go here again for sure
5
Had late and casual dinner and drinks with a friend, we enjoyed sharing a number of plates. Food service was fast.
4
A restaurant right on the edge of the Arab district.Great tasting mexican food and reasonable prices. Service was good.Local beer was cold and good. Only negative was the automatic 10% service fee added-No questions asked.
Still a good place to dine.Recommended!
5
This is the first time I've experienced that the waitress makes the guacamole in the front of you. Food was amazing. You have to eat the guacamole.
4
Cool area to visit and had a very chilled and large Mexican meal here with family . The Alambre was awesome as were the nachos. Definitely recommended. Reasonable price too
5
Good Mexican meal. Wide variety of food and drinks . Best to spend and evening with friends outside this restaurant. Must try - guacamole and nachos with salsa
4
This place is very neat and feisty. The service is excellent and the food is simply outstanding. The burrito and their supreme sauces makes the meal special. Quesadilla and ice teas works well too.
5
Celebrated our daughter's 21st last week and it was a blast! A big thank you to Anush for such a well organised event. Everyone comment on the good food and service by the staff. Manjeet the bar tender was superb doing a great job keeping everyone's drinks full and keeping everyone in a celebrated mood.Thanks for a enjoyable night
5
Located at the corner of haji lane and beach road, this is one of the best looking cafe in the area. Love the graffiti on the side of the cafe. The interior is quirky and unique, they have outdoor seating which is perfect on the day i visited as it was cloudy. Food was average, the quesadilla was good but taco was standard, had better ones. However it definitely worth a visit due to its location and interior. Staff was friendly and accommodating.
2
I heard the name of Piedra Negra from my coworker and she highly recommended me to try the food. I ordered the shrimp tacos and beef nachos. The moment they served the dish on the table, I was impressed by the presentation. However, I was surprised by the the time I saw they friend the shrimp with some batter and the taste was disappointing. I have had a really excellent Mexican food before and it could have been taste better. However the service was great, the staffs were very attentive with the customers
5
Spent a week in Singapore last and found this place across the Road from the Parkroyal on Beach Road. Went there 3 times in a week and loved it every time. The food was fantastic. Hot and spicy. Try the the Criss Cross Fires and the Jalapeno Poppers they've both really tasty. As for the the drinks, they make a better Singapore Sling than at the long bar at Raffles. Their Mango Margarita's are great too
3
Had drinks and ordered some food. It wasn't that busy but to get services was a bit challenging. Also the supposedly Mexican food came with what look like Indian papadum instead of a wrap. We had to order separate wrap - at an additional fee.
5
Excellent food - super delicious. Extremely friendly staff. They make their own chips. Everything is freshly made - the Guacamole that make on ur table is just awesome. So if the tortialla soup. Actually most items on the menu are fantastic
5
Piedra Negra looks like a quaint little Mexican restaurant from the Beach Road side but is actually huge-and still very quaint.The happy hour drink prices here are great (especially for Singapore!) and include a few great tap options which is perfect on a balmy night.The menu is huge-we had the burritos and they were so delicious and good value for money. The service was friendly and very prompt, which is ideal when travelling with a 2yo. They also had plenty of high chairs.For awesome food, great atmosphere, prompt service and good value for families or couples, Piedra Negra is spot on
3
Went for dinner on a balmy night in singapore. The restaurant gave us a nice table outside to enjoy the heat. The drinks were reasonably priced, especially if you bought in greater scale (like in jugs or pitchers). The food was fairly standard and quite tasty. Overall it wasn't anything exceptional, but it was a simple, good Mexican meal
2
Ok. Maybe this was not the best idea. I gave it two but could be a three maybe. The style is nothing I was expecting. Table side guacamole was only 1 avocado and needs some help. I ordered the hard shell tacos. Didn't think I would get was a shell rolled around the neat and the deep fried. Think I call that a taquito nit a taco. Friends enchiladas were soft tacos laying in a dish and an almost water sauce on top. So if you want to try a Singapore idea of Mexican food give it a try. If your looking for true Mexican, your not going to find it here.
4
This Mexican is brilliantly located on the edge of Kampong Glam, an area of Singapore full of amazing places to eat, drink and hear music. The restaurant itself is funky, nice decor, good music playing etc. We started with nachos and frozen margaritas. The nachos were ok, not exactly packed with toppings and no discernible flavour. The margaritas on the other hand were fantastic! Main courses were generally agreed to be 'ok'. Some of the portions were very small and would really struggle to be called a main course anywhere else. My vegetarian burrito came with waffle cut fries (who serves fries with a burrito?!) and again, no discernible flavour. Couldn't distinguish anything except large chunks of courgette (courgette??) and cheese. Couldn't see/taste the rice, beans, salsa etc. We cracked on with the margaritas rather than order more food and surprisingly had a very good night!Short version: don't bother with the food, stick to the drinks and enjoy the atmosphere
5
This place is great! I went with a friend of mine as she visits here quite often for some delicious mexican food and well priced drinks.The service was great. Both inside and outside seating, comfortable, and able to take reservations if you're coming in a larger group.Apparently later in the nights the place gets rather busy and the vibe is good fun! The food was excellent, large portions, hot, warm, and fresh! Loved it!Thanks! I'll be back with more friends in the near future
5
An amazing place to visit with friends for a good Mexican food. They offer a wide range and variety of dishes and drinks. Located near the Arab street and the beach road, its a good place to eat before a night life stint in SIngapore. Must try their fresh Guacomole that they prepare right on your table with fresh ingredient
2
Stopped here in the early evening for some beer and light food. The place was practically empty, but the service was horrible actually. We had to ask 2-3x for everything. Even the bill was a hassle. Server seemed uninterested in us or other customers. Prices are steep too. The corn chips were received were a bit soft (soggy) but the guac was good. I would not come back any time soon
4
We have booked the level 2 of Piedra Negra Cafe for a private function on June 30th as a farewell to a Japanese colleague who is retiring. All of them loved the food and the atmosphere. We also had the liberty to play our own music selection.We all had a wonderful and memorable evening.Thank you to Anuj and Terry as well as the other team members for making our evening memorable
4
Absolutely yummy Mexican food! Spent a night there with friends and the food was gastronomic in taste and size! Great place to share some good laughter with some friends!
5
Lovely place ! Ambience amazing. Drinks and food very good ! Must see on Arab street when in Bugis
We enjoyed the music and the margaritas and it is usually crowded
3
Nice atmosphere in Arab street, but this restaurant is a little dark and cramped. Friendly staff, great cocktails, but I wasn't enamoured by the food. Loved that the server made fresh guacamole at our table, which was delicious.
3
The food here was good mexican as it gets in Singapore. The location is good with very good experience. Burritos was good. Service wad good and prompt
4
Getting good Mexican can always be tricky when traveling. Piedra Negra is pretty good. Quesadillas and Nachos are good and lots of drinks to choose from. Nice outdoor seating on Beach Road and also great drinking spot on Haji lane side. Good and friendly staff. If you need your fix, this is the place
4
Good food and drinks, fast service, medium to big portions, they make guacamole fresh on your table - excellent. Lively and fun vibe and overall a great place to spend an evening with friend and family in this little corner tucked away in haji lane towards beach road exit. Will re-visit.
3
My friends and I visited this place when we were craving for some mexican food. I find the place adorable because it is so colorful.We seated outside to people watch while eating our dinner. Serving is big and good for sharing. Food is good and tasty. The drink is a disappointment though. We ordered iced tea, the glass is so thick. Hence, the content is really small.Staff are not smiling making them unapproachable. They should smile when attending to guests
4
Piedra Negra has been our go to restaurant for casual evening eats for almost two years! The margaritas are delicious, the guacamole freshly made at your table and the nachos piled high. This is a great place for celebrating, chilling out & sharing a few dishes with friends. The overall selection of food is great and the prices very reasonable. So many other restaurants near downtown focus on the overall aesthetic and over-charge for their dishes whilst disappointing on taste, portion size and quality of ingredients. We are very thankful to have this place in Singapore!
4
My family was there last night, its crowded for a thurs night, luckily we had our reservation done.nice ambience, tasty food (we had guacamole - nice and refreshing start to your meal, meatballs with soft warm tortilla - tasty meatballs, thou only 3 meatballs but they are quite filling, beef quesadilla - perfectly done and tasty and its not as heavy as enchiladas, burger - asked for medium but it came out well done so a bit dry, pork rib - tender and meat literally drop off the bone), we also had beer, iced tea, lime juice, banana smoothie but a bit too sweet.good place to wind down after work and catch up with friends. but it was a bit noisy when we were there, partly bcos they were full during that time
5
Best venue for a private party ( 40-50 people). The second floor of the restaurant has been specially designed for a DJ , dance floor , in built bar , area for buffet dinner. It even has in built toilets. the most cosy feature is a little mezzanine area to go and relax during the party. This is one venue which also provides it's own food for the party and the food is really good. The events manager Anuj, guided us very well and was very responsive throughout the planning process. On the party day his team headed by Terry was super helpful and totally alert and caring in every way
5
The best Mexican food I've tasted outside of Mexico and California. The ingredients are quality and very tasty. The staff are friendly. If you like Mexican food you must visit this place when in Singapore.
3
This bar has ice cold beer for standard singaporian buck. Servers are not that excited about their job and you get a bill even before they serve you the last round. Mediocre experience for me.
4
We really enjoyed the food and fresh juices here, went for an early dinner. Very relaxed atmosphere, portion size more appropriate for snack that full meal. Prices are friendly.
5
Fantastic food, good service, reasonable price. Great ambience! We've enjoyed a Saturday dinner, ordered almost everything on the menu and all the items tasted great!
2
Was there in the early afternoon and the restaurant had a stale stench. It really turned me off. Unfortunately my colleagues chose the venue so had to endure my ordeal. I think it was the sofa chairs that had the stench and the toilet was smelly. The smell from the toilet comes into the dining area. Don't they wash toilets before starting operations???Not much to say about the food as I had lost my appetite and never had much except nachos. Only had drinks. Place has potential but seriously cleanliness and ambience up keeping is highly in need of review
5
We came here 2 times during our 4 night stay in Singapore... It would have been 3 times but on a Friday night it was packed and we couldn't get a table - showing how popular it is!! So get there early on the weekend! It was the best place to eat and drink in Singapore! The staff were lovely and very kind and helpful. The trainee bar tender was excellent in his approach and offered us great service... And he looked after us - so he is a great asset to the already brilliant team. Staff Supervisor is also very accommodating - we love this place and would recommend to anyone to go there, and enjoy good food, drink and great compan
1
Last time I visit this restaurant was EXCELLENT.Now they lost the touch, the taste of the food is not even close to Tex-Mex so imagine real Mexican food not even a clue about, the tomato soup now is like dessert sweet and tasteless, the tacos no idea what is a taco, a tortilla filled with something and full of LETUCE now called taco, the salsa just sugar with some color, I don't think I'll come back again, the only Mexican left is the name and fewer beers and margaritas.If you want to eat Mexican food look for another place, if you need to eat is ok, don't expect to much, at least not the flavors they used to have.The place lost identity a shame for a excellent food they serve in the past
5
As a Texan I was thrilled to find the BEST Mexican food in Asia at Piedra Negra in Singapore! Everything from the beef nachos to the enchiladas reminded me of the wonderful Tex-Mex I enjoy often in Austin. If you like great Mexican food (and who doesn't?) then this is the place for you
4
We went to this place for early pre-dinner yesterday evening. Only a few tables were occupied. A lot of staffs, but all not pay any attention to customers. It was hard to find one outside to take order, take additional order, get the bill and etc. It's too painful to stay longer. We ordered vegetarian nachos while they brought it out said it was chicken nachos.. Hmmmm and the chicken enchiladas ordered turned out to be beef. My hubby ate it 2 bites and waiter ran over to told him that it wasn't chicken. Oh dear.. Staffs seriously needed a full training here. The foods were good in terms of taste and quality. The portion were generous. We would returning for a short-time visit in the future. I couldn't handle such a low service quality for long.
3
I was craving something Mexican and suggested this for a first date. The place is rather easy to get to if you walk from bugis mrt.The service is quite good and the waitress is very friendly. I put it as 3/5 for a few reasons which might be just me being picky..I had the hard tacos with a separate order of guacamole as well as a margarita.The margarita taste pretty virgin. I don't know if it has even a shot of tequila in it, since I can only taste the sweetness and the ice. (it might be better if it is not ice blended - I don't know)The tacos are rolled, with the meat inside - again, I don't know if I'm strange but I like my tacos with lots of salsa, sour cream, lettuce, guacamole and meat. The beef was slightly stringy, still very tasty, but I miss the other stuff that usually comes with.The guacamole is fabulous. Freshly made, it has half an avocado, mashed with some seasoning and some salsa. It also came with a huge basket of mixed blue corn and the normal nacho chips. Again, I kind of miss sour cream (yes, I am an addict)The other reason that it lost a star is the atmosphere. When we first went in, it was early evening (my friend had a call and we had to do early dinner), and the music was playing at a background level, so we could hear each other speaking at a normal volume. As the dinner progressed, the music got louder and louder as the other diners also got louder and louder. It became a vicious cycle: as the music got louder, people had to talk louder to hear each other over the music, and then someone turned up the music volume more to compensate for the decibel of the diners. We both stopped talking after a while because it is impossible to hear each other. Which sucked.Especially when there are lots to talk about
5
Great place. The food was outstanding. The guacamole was prepared right at our table and the staff could fill us in on the origins of the ingredients. I highly recommend this is place for its food, staff and ambience.
5
I had a very good dinner in this restaurant. The enchilada was great. It's located in a very quiet street with lots of restaurants and they have a long terrace. Prices are good and the quality of the food is excellent.
3
Food was below expectation. Maybe I did not order their signature menus.. the salsa taste is not that I favor. Too sour to me.
2
Three times the next morning it was painfully and smelly
They also are very rude and over charge you by about 40% to their neighbouring shop
3
Good place for you to drop by for drinks and solid Mexican snacks. I would give it a try if you happen to be in the area sightseeing or winding down for the day. The price is also just nice for Singapore.
4
Checked it out on a Friday night..the place has a good buzz and staff were attentive despite being quite busy. Food was good but nothing to shout about. Enjoyed the whole atmosphere and reasonably priced.. Will return!
4
Hajji Lane is happening, with more hipster joints than Woodstock had hippy joints. Amid the funky cafes and trendy dress shops with their distressed denim and heritage lace, sits Piedra Negra. The food was excellent, with guacamole made at the table by the waiter with a pestle and mortar, and very tasty quesadillas. The prawn tacos were outstanding. The mojito menu is also worthy of note and the vibe felt authentically Latino. I'd come back
4
Loved the wonderful Arab Quarter in Singapore with a great selection of Restaurants. Food was great and service was efficient and speedy. Drinks expensive as always in Singapura. For some reason only able/willing to serve drinks on the outside tables-weird one! Strongly recommend this restaurant and location if you are a multi-culturalist
1
Really bad service. No one cared to ask me for orders. After waiting I went to the counter to ask for the menu. Waited long time for food and drinks. Food was really bad- not fresh and bland. The worst Mexican food I have tasted. This is the first and last time for me.
4
Loved the atmosphere, close to loads of bars and other restaurants near arab street. I love classic margaritas on the rocks and i really enjoyed theirs! Guacamole was made fresh at the table and the pork tacos were yum! Great value and lots of seating inside or outside. Defintely worth a try
5
Delicious and a hidden gem for authentic Mexican cuisine. Generous savings from entrees and mains to desserts and side dishes. Yum!
5
The burritos and quesadillas are great! The place is lovely and the service is very good. You should definitly go there!
3
Good place to stop on your Arab Street tour. Husband had beers and I had a couple of mojitos and checked out our emails. Nice to sit out on the pavement and watch the world go by.
4
Good food, good environment n music, not so good staff, not too high priced for the whole deal. Please try the nachos. Thank me later.

Everytime I crave for mexican food, I come to this place. Love the nachos and burritos. Aside from food, I like the interiors and the overall feel of the place. They also play Mexican music that makes you feel you're in Mexico :p

Singapore has an amazing variety of places to eat but Piedra Negra has somehow become our regular spot to return to.A jug of frozen Margharita along with the Mango Ceviche and the Chili con Carne Nachos is a must order, every time.Then we get a couple more dishes, mixing it up each time. So far the highlights are the Fish Tacos and the Tacos de Alambre. Looking forwarf to trying the new Pork Tacos next week!Service is friendly and prompt and the prices are very reasonable by Singapore standards. We love the place
1
Staff have a good to do and at times with some customers it can be difficult. We are not those people. We enter and say hello, all we expect back is a simple friendly hello back and the good service. Not much to ask for. We have been twice, treated the same way, won't go again.
3
The great thing about this place is it conveniently located on the corner of of Beach Rd and Haji Lane. Tell you out of town friends to meet you at the corner and they will naturally gravitate to the Peidra Negra drinking tables in front of them and colourful murals on the walls. Don’t spend too long there as its a little pricey. A jug of Sangria (6 glasses) will set you back SGD 65, a glass of wine SGD 14 and a pint of the local Singapore Tiger Beer SGD 12. The Haji Lane area is happening. Use this place as the first step in your trip. Enjoy
3
What Piedra Negra has going for it the most is the location. Its become the brightest flagbearer of Haji Lane’s slightly bohemian, offbeat, vibrant vibe, with huge colourful murals on the street walls and a brightly done up place that wraps itself around the corner. So you could sit in two different kinds of indoor seating areas and a couple of different streetside ones too. Fridays and Saturdays can get quite boisterous but not overbearingly so.They have some good Sangria, margaritas that have been sometimes just ok, and sometimes very good. Their guacamole is a highlights, beat up and made right in front of you. Food is tasty and mostly dependable. A good place for a cheery, convivial evening.
4
This restaurant offered delicious Mexican food. They made Guacamole freshly right in front of you. We ordered frozen margaritas for drinks, mango ceviche, nachos for starters and then main courses including beef tacos and Enchiladas, etc. It was an enjoyable dining experience, and met my expectations.
3
I love the decoration. So colorful. Good to take some selfie. The ambience is also nice tho, as well with the service. Not too crowded. But the taste of the food is quite so-so. Or maybe is it just me whose not into mexican food.
5
Wonderful mexican food. This restaurant offered authenticate mexican food in a great location and at a reasonable price.
4
Good basic Mexican fare and cool beer. You can sit on street or inside which as TVs showing sport. I had a chicken burrito which was very tasty. Service is good and fast. Recommended.

We enjoyed our drinks in this funky part of Singapore in Haji lane.
The guacamole dip was fresh and the lane was a very happening place. Loved it!!
5
Firstly, a good Mex restaurant has to be able to make good Margarita's and this one does it with ease both by the glass and impressively by the jub.. Glass best on rocks - Jug best frozen as it doesn't stay frozen too long in SingaporeFood - recommend the Mango Ceviche and the Beef Salad - best is both very fresh and actually filling without that heaviness so many Mexican meals can leave you with.The guacamole is also good and made at your table - we actually had two of them a starter and it was so good - we had it again for a finisher and washed down by awesome marggy..Inside or outside is good depending on how you handle the heat.. But outside is good for people watching as it sides onto Haji Lane which is in itself a great place to hang on a Friday evening.Piedra Negra is well worth the visit and best with a group.. what could be better - Good Mex food, good margaritas and a cool ambiance as wel
5
this mexican restaurant is the bomb. every time i'm craving for a guacamole i'll go here. the guacamole it served and done in front of you so you know it's fresh. plus the ambiance is really nice as well as the people. and the wall art outside is one of the spot that most people or tourist go to. :

I ended up visiting this place with a friend who is pure vegetarian on a Saturday evening. The place was recommended to me long time ago by a colleague. I did not get chance to try it. It was recommended for Pizza. But me & my friend decided to try the Mexican cousin. It turned out to be avery good choice. We had to wait for 5-10 mins to get the table. We didn't mind it much. The table that we got was next to the road along the street. The service was quick. We ordered veg Burritos and veg Enchiladas. Both the dishes were very well cooked. The crisps / fries served with Burritos were very crispy. The Enchiladas were little bit spicy. I am not sure if this is normal taste. But for individual used to eating regular dose of Indian spices at home it did not make much difference. Me & my friend we both liked the food. The staff was friendly and the service was very quick. I am sure I will visit this place again with my family to explore other food options.
4
Walking surround bugis area and this is one of eating place you need to try. Food are good according the price. Service ok. Just missing in aome decoration. Combination of spain and mexico. Ild ac and too low and too much compare to building and seat
3
I have been to this place twice and both times I found it a pretty decent place for Mexican food. its not out of the world food, but decent enough and the best part about it is, it has very many vegetarian options.on both occasions I had their homemade guacamole which was fun as a guy comes in with a mortar and pestle, adds in half a avocado, onions, jalapenos, cilantro and lime juice , mixes them in front of you. I found that novel and interesting way to attract tourists. we tried alambra - veg and chicken , lamb stew (which was not too bad - or so my friends say) , nachos, patata bravas, burritos, flautas. I had a margarita which wasn't too bad. and mango lassee which was simply great.so they have some great, some just average options, making this place a little more than average for me. this is an offshoot of BluJazz cafÃ© and ambience wise, I think they have nailed it
3
We stopped into Piedra Negra for a quick snack when checking out the amazing Haji Lane in Singapore (highly recommended for a coffee and shop) and had cocktails and chicken burritos. The food was good and affordable but the drinks (we had caipiroskas) were excellent. You won't be amazed, but you definitely won't be disappointed. Piedra Negra has a really cool vibe, so I'd definitely recommend checking it out when heading out to Haji Lane
3
Food was nice, tried the guacamole prepared at my table & the vegetarian burrito, both very satisfactory. Wasn't too impressed with service which although friendly wasn't always quick. Nice place though & cool decor/nice terrace. (Previous reviews are accurate)
3
Went here last night- busy little place serving pleasant Tex Mex Style Mexican.Food is fresh and servings large. We found it lacked flavour depth and heat( obviously dulled down perhaps for the tourist market?)
Positives -great service and good prices on drinks.
4
Very nice funky place - very popular so book if you want to sit street side -personally we preferred to eat inside with aircon! Food good, margeritas excellent.
4
Having dined at this particular institution on a number of occasions I feel obliged to finally appraise it!
The dishes are savoury and seasoned braced along with a splendid beverage list!
4
Great choice on corner of Haji Lane and Beach road.
Nice friendly service, quality food and reasonable prices.
The decor is fun and fresh and unique. I had the beef with tortillas and it was great. Succulent and tasty.
4
We were here for lunch with a friend. It's a very relaxed and casual setting. The menu's pretty extensive with multiple vegetarian options - huge plus from my perspective!They are also one of the few places here that have Chilli Rellenos on the menu, so I obviously had to have it! We got two of those and a plate of veggie Nachos. To drink, we got an Iced Latte and a Horchata.The food arrived pretty quickly, so we got right down to eating! The Chilli Rellenos were pretty good - one obese stuffed batter fried Chilli came along with a portion of rice and smashed black beans topped with barely there Queso. The portion size was good - the only thing wanting was the flavour in the sauce. Some heat and some depth would've been nice. The Nachos were pretty good - all the heat that should've been in the Rellenos landed there - heaping spoons of sliced jalapenos! The Horchata was delightful and the Latte was pretty good. The prices were more than decent, particularly for the location. I would definitely go back, also to try some of their interesting sounding cocktails
3
In many ways I want to give 4 stars, but the food is simply not 4 stars. The location is. The staff is not - waited at a table ten minutes before even getting the menu when some people in the staff was talking 10 minutes with friends. So in no way 4 stars sorry. 4 stars means attentive staff and food above average, and neither wasGood location though but they seem to use this to become arrogant and lazy - also with the food quality. Food was decent but far from 4 star
5
Great Mexican food.If you order guacamole they make it in a pestle and mortar in front of you which is a nice touch. The building is beautifully tiled in typical Mexican colours and attracts a lot of people just for photos.Sit outside if you can, great location for people watching as you dine
5
the food taste so nice, and deliciouse please try alambra bread with chicken and lamb=taste so wouw its only less than 16-17 sing dollarits at beach road, im stay at prak royal hotel beach road, and just walk less than 3-4 min from hotel u will arrive @ this hote
4
Just went on another excursion from the Little Indian RMT station to get back to my hotel Park royal. Found a little beer place with lovely Philippines hostesses and a couple of tiger pints but found the inner strength to move on ( don't know how I did that) but ended up a block away at Piedra Negra. Great frozen Margarita home made chips and guacamole and a chicken quesadilla I love Singapor
5
Great food, service, ambiance and jugs of margaritas. Been twice in 1 trip as Arab St area is historic and buzzing. Live music in the nearby late bars too.
4
A wonderful, family friendly restaurant that serves scrumptious Mexican food in a nice, cosy setting. Very interesting menu with a lot of variety. Friendly service and comfortable setting. Highly recommended for group dinners.
4
Quite a cozy corner eatery with seating of high & low tables, excellent service, depending on the whether one can choose table outside or inside. One can opt for a evening with drinks and quality Mexican cuisine. Overall an enjoyable likable experience.
4
We were taken here by a local. you can sit inside or out, good atmospher and the service was good. The food tasted good and was served quickly. The price contra quality is good.
The pork ribs was realy good and worth trying!
4
I stumbled upon this restaurant at the end of Haji Lane and I really wasn't expecting much - maybe just normal american-mexican food. But the beef burrito was delicious! The meat marinated so well, and the combination with the cheese just made it a great comfort food. They also served it with *pacho fries (not really sure if that's what they're called) with a tasty dip. I haven't had too much mexican food in my life, but I do try a lot of cuisines and restaurants, and this was indeed delicious
4
A bright coloured and vibrant restaurant in the Arab Quarter. When in Singapore why not go for Mexican food??!!! Great food and drinks. The waiter made an error in our food order, however the food was still delicious. Traditional mexican cuisine with some unique options. The margaritas and mojitos were really good. Comfortable, relaxing and cheap eating. Ideal low key friendly dining
5
Ive been going to P-N for 4 years now whenever I visit Singapore and it continues to be a my treasured favorite. The atmosphere is always relaxed with a nice musical vibe and the food is consistantly up to standard (recommend the beef alhambra!)Be sure to make the most of their excellent cocktails too!One downside - outside seating is right next to the main road :
3
A friend and I popped in here, lured by the good smells and colorful decor. While the guacamole was good (nothing on what you can find in the States, but decent for Singapore), my overpriced shrimp "tacos" were disgusting: two deep fried rolls (in what world do these count as 'tacos'?) of only shrimp and cheese, drizzled with mayo. I could barely eat more than a few bites before I had to send it back. Luckily, they dealt with it graciously and didn't try to charge us for that entree.Meh. Might go back for happy hour but not again for food
2
Love the building and decor of this restaurant. It was lovely sitting outside near the narrow alley way, people watching. The Margarita was good but expensive and hardly alcoholic. We ordered the chicken quesadilla which was ok but nothing special, however the chicken burrito is just diabolical, quite inedible! Not very authentic Mexican food. The staff were friendly but not very attentive. Won't see us going back there
4
Tucked away in the bustling Arab quarter, this place is a nice little Mexican joint. The food (guacamole, ceviche, taquitos, pork) was good, especially the guac and ceviche. The price was reasonable compared to other places in Singapore. Decent selection of tequilas and several classic cocktails on offer.The service was actually excellent. We showed up somewhat early (6:30) on a Wednesday night and the place was pretty quiet, but definitely got busy later, but it didn't affect the quality of service.The decor is quirky and feels like you're in a Mexican restaurant somewhere in the States, if not Mexico.Parking in the neighborhood is really tough. Go early if you want a spot somewhere, or take a cab
4
We went here in late November with a few friends. The location is great, the staff are friendly, the drinks are good and I would particularly recommend the guacamole as they make it at the table in front of you. Very reasonably priced too.
4
A group of us dined at this restaurant when we traveled Singapore. The dishes are unique and classic, the service was good and the atmosphere was fun. Would recommend to any traveler looking for a safe place to eat.
5
Our family happened upon this restaurant and bar as we were staying nearby. It was so good we kept going back throughout our holiday. Really, really good food and fast service.
5
The quesadillas and alambre are good! the mango smoothie is nice as well! This is a good place if you are looking for mexican food!
2
Unfortunately did not have such a great experience here. Starters came out after the mains, portion size was very small considering the price. Main meat tasted of no seasoning and swimming in oil, potato starter had little flavour, but service was average.
2
We called into Piedra Negra this afternoon for a drink. The service was not great. Eventually a staff member left her take away food to come and take our order. She took the order and went and sat down again to keep eating her meal with other staff members. My husband asked if we could change the order she said no because the order was ready. We then sat for another 10 minutes until eventually the order was delivered. We ended up with a warm white wine and a warm pint of Tiger beer...$31 Singapore dollars for 2 drinks with bad service and attitude.I realize that staff need to eat but surely they should have a meal break away from the main dining area. Never again, there are too many other places where the service is better and the value for money is better
4
The empanadas are good. The beer is cold. The music is loud. This is a fun place to be on Saturday night. They extend the seating into the lane outside and the crowd is pretty good. Interesting artwork on the walls. Can keep you occupied for a while
5
Amazing service (over 2 nights), excellent food, great atmosphere. Every dish spot on & great value 4 money in an expensive city. In particular i would like 2 thank pawan 4 his great service - i am in the service industry myself & i applaud his service
4
Price is very reasonable for Singapore and food and drink quality easily outstrips the budget by a country mile.Margaritas are about $14 a piece (including tax). Pretty sure all the ingredients are fresh (lime juice, Cointreau, tequila, etc. - didn't taste that crappy sour mix stuff)Ceviche was excellent - not filled with squid and octopus like other places do but with real white fish, peppers, lime juice, cilantro, etc. Tortilla chips taste like they're quite fresh and go amazingly well with the hand-made guacamole.Great spot for Mexican food and fun location in Bugis.I go quite often and will continue to do so
4
We popped in here for a drink and a snack as it was here our hotel. We had done Salsa, guacamole and chips. The guacamole is made fresh at your table and was the best I have had in Mexican restaurant would definitely go back to see what the main meals were like.
4
Located near my hotel, and my best friend just took me here for chit chat and having food off course! Love the ambience of the place. It's so colourful indeed! The service was good and the most important thing the food was also good! Can't ask for more. Love it
5
I am a mexican, so when I was in Singapore I was looking for mexican food.. pretty difficult, but then I discoverd this restaurant, I went there around three time.The food is really really good, the chef is mexican so the foos is authentic. I was the happiest girl at that moment. :
3
We were looking for a table in the crowded Haji Lane. This appeared to be the only place with a table for six.We took a chance as the inside looked good.However, the food that came out was average and the servings were small.Will try somewhere else next time
4
We wandered into this bar mostly to escape the heat but also to pause in our journey around haji lane and Turkish shops. Staff were casual but friendly, the place was 1/2 empty in the early evening but it's worth looking at just for the décor inside the bar. We ordered the guacamole and chips and the waiter brought everything to the table and had the kids assist in making it which was just fabulous! A quaint experience worth trying
4
If you want to have a relaxed evening with friends - hop over to this lovely mexican joint in the heart of Singapore's centre. Its got a lively atmosphere and a selection of great food to get you started. the guacamole and nachos are the best we've had in Singapore and the rest of the starters are tastefully designed
3
So this was my first time in the famed haji lane and it was underwhelming at best, and quite disappointing. The shops and restaurants didn't look inviting and we were scouting hard for a dinner place. Finally landed hereThe menu looks good, but that's about it. The mango cerviche was ok with a decent number of mango cubes. My enchilada main was as boring as can be and the presentation on the plate was not well done. My mojito came in a smallish mug and 2/3 of it was ice and mint leaves. Had a few sips and the drink was goneOverall a rather deflated evening and $40 per pax poore
2
Many people. Tried 7 different dishes since me and my fiends shared but nothing to brag about. The waiters are nice and fun and the ice margaritas are good. Was there friday evening, the music was to loud and to crowded. Nice street, you probably find better food here than this restaurant
1
I went to Piedra Negra with two friends at the end of May. We were looking to go for a drink and found the outside tables of Piedra Negra inviting. Sadly, it went downhill from there. To order, we had to go inside to ask whether we might be so bold as to request someone take our order since no one had bothered asking us what we would like to have within the first 10 minutes we were there. The one non-alcoholic drink arrived within a further five minutes - the cocktails were an unexceptable additional 15 minutes. Worst of all, they were undrinkable. Both the Mojito as well as the Cuba Libre tasted off in fact, the Cuba Libre tasted very much like a Mojito also. To talk of taste is taking it a bit far, however, since there was mostly ice in the drinks. We barely touched our drinks as we were uniformly of the opinion that they were disgusting. Since no waiter came by for another ten minutes we asked for the bill inside again and saw that we quickly left this place. Easily the worst service and bar experience in Singapore
4
I've been to Piedra Negra a couple of nights ago, eating on one of the small tables outside in the street. The atmosphere of Arab street's small lanes is impressive, colours and lights make it even more enjoyable. Waiters were very busy, no one welcomed us when we arrived, and it took a while to speak with them, with the impression that they were avoiding eye contact. Again, it wasn't simple to order because waiters were avoiding any eye contact, making me a little frustrated.Fortunately the food was awesome, I tried nachos, chili, hamburger and they all had a great taste demonstrating high quality of the ingredients.I liked it so much that I'll definitely go there again, congratulations to the chef and his assistants but a little disappointed from the rest of the staf
5
After browsing all the fabulous vintage stores in Haji Lane we came across Piedra Negra. Not being huge fans of Mexican with reservations we thought we give it a try but we were pleasantly surprised. The food was very good, service was excellent and the jug of mojito superb. Would absolutely recommend Piedra Negra is you feel like Mexican in Singapore
3
I am not a big fan of Mexican, but the service was quick and the food was OKish. Certainly don't regret going there. As a variation in going to neighbourhood restaurants i may go again.
4
My husband and I live in Singapore and we are used to go Piedra Negra. It's a nice Mexican restaurant located close to Arab St. There is plenty of choice for dishes: burritos, quesadillas, enchiladas... of for drinks: beers, cocktails. Margarita lemon on the rock is the best of Singapore!I definitely recommend this place
4
I was really happy with my visit to Piedra Negra last night. The service wasn't perfect but it was well above average. The frozen magarita's were spot on and were a highlight. The atmosphere in Haji Lane is unique in Singapore. It is really cool and laid back. Even if you don't eat here, it is worth a wander around at night. The food was really good. I had the Pork Ribs and they were superb. The highlight was my wife's meal. Unfortunately we can't remember the name (too many margarita's???). It was like a fajita and was out of this world. It was a little bit pricy but not excessively so. We managed to get an outside table which is preferable and you should aim for this. I'm not a massive fan of al fresco dining but the Haji Lane atmosphere makes it a must. I'll be going back and would recommend it to my friends if I was more popular
2
As the title suggests, nothing special. When I arrived two waiters walked striaght past me... I had to follow a waitress to ask for a table. Food- below average & no value for money. I had the garlic mushrooms which were average... the taco I received was greasy & only had a small amount of filling- very disappointed.Service- rubbish. Not one member of staffed smiled! Wouldn't recommend or visit again
4
Was there once again after a long gap. The place has expanded a fair bit and now looks more like a restaurant than a cafe. We chose the outdoor seating and ordered our fix of drinks and mexican accompaniments. Not disappointing as always. We didnt even have a look at the menu and dont know if there are any changes since I last visited. I have tried almost all the famed Mexican joints on the island and this one would be one of the best. The Habanero though is not home made and hence not as good as some others have.
5
As an American living in Singapore I often find myself craving some tasty Mexican food. Luckily I have discovered a great place to enjoy authentic Mexican just around the corner from where I live. Piedra is great, albeit a bit expensive. Their Chili Relleno is the real deal. I think they should open a taco window or something like that to cater to walk up cheapskates (like me) that are craving a snack. Just an idea! Check out PN, have a margarita, some of the table made guac, and enjoy.
2
We ordered the quesadillas n tacos..the tacos were more like lumpia.. They did not look like the one I expected, tastewise it was dry. The guacamole tasted too onionish to my taste. The price is considered high seeing the ambience n the environment. Staff were not friendly as if we were eating on a free coupons that they i must say gave us a disturbed look. The free nachos was one good thing about my visit here.
5
We had dinner at this restaurant earlier tonight and it was great! The service was very good and they even offered a non spicy version of their burrito for our toddler. The meals themselves were reasonably priced, around 12 to 22 for a main, and although they looked to be on the small side they did not fail to fill us up. Another thing we liked about the meals was that they were not saturated in cheese like other Mexican meals we have had. We will definitely be returning to this restaurant when we are in Singapore next
5
Yummmo! My friend and I were excited when we learned there was a Mexican restaurant near our guest house. We are both vegetarians who live in Asia so we are always looking for something other than the standards we rely on day to day. We first went on the Monday night, and were really disappointed to find it closed! We tried again the next day and yay it was open! We ordered 2 Sols, guacamole to start, and tacos flautas with potatos to share. The guac was made right at our table, so fresh and lovely, it was amazing! My only comment would be that I like a wee bit of heat to my guac and so does my friend, so we ended up adding a little bit of hot sauce to it. We probably should have mentioned we like chilis in the first place, our bad! The tacos flautas were crispy and delicious, and garnished perfectly. Service was smiling and prompt, and the atmosphere was great (wish we could have had a table outside, we'll have to show up earlier next time!) Over all: Awesomesauce
5
I love this place. I ate there two days in a row! Before moving to Singapore, I lived in Southern California (where Mexican food is a way of life) and this restaurant is like HOME to me! I met the Executive Chef, Leo, from Mexico City, he has put together the perfect menu. It is a perfect balance of traditional southern Mexico dishes (Octopus cooked in its own ink) and northern Mexico (Tex-Mex) dishes (burritos and nachos). The food is FRESH and delicious. This may be the best Mexican restaurant I have ever been too. The guacamole is made fresh in a stone bowl at your table, the atmosphere is fun (Arab Street Area), and the Margaritas are the best in Singapore! Executive Chef Leo has done a fantastic job with this restaurant
4
A cute local
located on one of the narrow streets
a small terrace, but scenic with simple furniture
various drinks, served nice
friendly staff
a pleasant, fun atmosphere
3
A good margarita followed by freshly made guacamole and some nachos makes a nice evening start. And go somewhere else for diner as the enchiladas or tacos are merely reheated in microwave, giving an horrible texture and flat flavor.
4
Went here with work for a leaving dinner.The food was very tasty and the choice good. Also a good selection of beers to choose from.
Service was generally very quick even for such a large party.
Would recommend this restaurant
4
Really enjoy the vibe this restaurant/bar offers...the food is really well made considering they were packed on a friday night. Of coz ..the magaritas were YUM!
4
This is a great place to start your evening with a couple of chilled beers and the guacamole (made in a stone bowl with fresh ingredients right in front of you) or anything else on the menu really. Apart from the amazing scenery of Arab Street (the outisde and inside of Piedra Negra included!), the staff is friendly and the food is great. Been back here so many times I lost count
4
I went to Piedra Negra in Singapore for dinner in July 2013, and while not the most awesome Tex-Mex ever (a tall order when I have been to Texas & California), I did enjoy both the meal and the restaurant, and thought it was a pretty good rendition of Tex-Mex for Singapore.Considering Singapore is far removed from Mexico & the south-western United States, the interior of the restaurant was quite well themed, and Singaporeâ€™s weather is conducive to eating Tex-Mex. Accordingly, I ordered some guacamole dip & corn chips, and beef taquitos, which were pretty good, and I ordered a Sol beer to accompany the meal. The waitress made the guacamole dip fresh at my table with a mortar & pestle, and it was subsequently fresh & delicious. All of this came to around $30sg, which I thought was reasonable given quality of the meal & restaurant.I will admit that based on the map I was looking at online, it appeared to be on Ophir Rd, not Beach Rd, and subsequently, I thought it must have closed down. It was only when I walked around the corner to Beach Rd that I realized the map was wrong, and in fact it was located on the Beach Rd part of the intersection, which may be a trap for young players depending on what map you are going by. I had taken the MRT to Bugis station, and the restaurant was only two blocks away
5
We had diner at Piedra Negra and we were really impress by the taste of the food. My husband is mexicain so his expectations are high. We like the food, the atmosphere, the service, the musique and the price was correct compare to an other mexicain restaurant we been in Singapore 2 days later...

I don't think i can say terrible enough times to be able convey how absolutely dismal this place is. Food is pathetic, service is ... What service!!, the management should be running the food line in a prison in central mexico. The senior staff are just bad people and it is evident in the way they treated us! please please please anyone who reads this review, save your money and go somewhere else!!We went in a group of about 12-15 people and in general you would expect that the bad food would plague only a couple of people but there wasn't a single person happy after this meal.The Good: There isn't anyThe Bad: There isn't any either, since it is all ugly!!!!The Ugly: There were some vegetarians in the group and so obviously we know what we ordered. One of the group arrived a bit later than anyone else and as soon as she arrives she ordered a Veggie burrito and lo and behold exactly 3mins later the waiter throws a burrito in front of her. Shocked at the speed of the service, we were very skpetical especially on the way we were treated earlier. And lo and behold we had every reason to be skeptical, as soon our firned bites into the burrito there are some not so succulent pieces of Beef!! Obviously annoyed, we called the waiter, intially thinking we would give him the benefit of the doubt as it could have been an honest mistake. So we tell the waiter there is beef and we ordered a veggie burrito, what does he do, he picks it up inspects and then throws it back on the table saying this is what you ordered eat it, this reaction obviously led to a huge altercation and the audacity of the unbelievably cheap management to even try to charge us for the burrito. The chicken i beleive was a mix of last weeks left overs and some quickly under cooked chicken to make up the quantity, as i Bit into it, the chicken tasted so stale and chewy and just tasted disgusting unfortunately i knew was not getting a refund and i was hungry so i took a second bite and this bite had pieces of under-cooked chicken. The nachos were probably the best thing on the table, but still nothing to write home about, so along with the nachos people usually give enough salsa to eat with the nachos, but these guys decide to give salsa in the size of a bowl which is probably just about enough for a single celled organism and when you ask them for more salsa so that you can cover another millimeter of the chip they charge you a few dollars for that. I cannot begin to tell you what a horrible place this is, please i beg you do not waste your money and your time, if you want really good mexican then go to Baja fresh.The sangria tasted like slightly fizzy, watered down fruit punch gatorade. The beers were luke warm and when again we confronted the manager, he said "thats all we have deal with it". The bad attitude and bad service resonates straight from the owner and trickles down to his minions. We even confronted the owner and told him how the food, service , drinks, ambience, seating just about everything is terrible. He said he does not care. Well i guess that's why the number of terrible reviews are on the rise for this place.This evening of ours was juts all in all a beyond terrible experience, we fought with them to get the Beef burrito taken off the bill. And even for that, to take an item of around 15 bucks to be taken off huge bill was such a big issue that even the police got involved ( i kid you not my friends!!), they called the police cause we said we are not going to pay for the beef burrito. A small victory at the end of the night for us that at least we didnt have to pay for the beef burrito but still just a very sour experienc

Whether you like genuine Mexican, Tex Mex or even home-made Old El paso, you'll be disappointed with this joint.The food was limp, poorly prepared, bland, small portions... one of the worst restaurant meals i've ever had.We tried the Burrito and the Chicken Enchiladas... both just a mess. Nothing close to expectations or quality food. The staff were also few and far between and disinterested, and the chairs outside are uncomfortably upright.OK to go for a beer, otherwise steer clea

Saw this place during the day and thought it looked neat somwent back in the evening with high hopes. unfortunate.Main course arrived before the guacamole starter and was cold. Dumped on the table so fast that it couldn't have seen much preparation beyond the microwave. Server couldn't make the guacamole at the table because the avocado was too unripe.Burritos and guacamole unremarkable for taste and burritos served with fries!!Overall experience totally underwhelming and $50 without alcoholic drinks for 2

Must try the guacomole which the make in front of you. The pork ribs were a bit dry but nachos and quesidillas were good. Come early on weekends as it gets packed fast.

We came here to satisfy my husband's craving for Mexican food. My first experience to try but I like the food here and colorful wall painting!

Yes, this small restaurant open until late, the waiter and waitress are very friendly and they have like number one nachos, complete with guacamole on side.. and the portion? you will never regret to stop by and enjoy some drink with nachos!

My husband and I trusted the tripadvisor reviews and were not disappointed. Loved the margaritas....had a lot in Asia never felt that they were using much tequila, not so at Piedra Negra. They've been here for 3 years and have a sister restaurant in KL. The decor is fun with a colorful terrazzo mosaic bar and a papier mache' flamingo dancer that comes off the wall. Good food, easy to find, and good location to walk around Arab Street area. Had a great time at Piedra Negra for under S$50

Love the food here. We loved it so much that we had both our lunch and dinner here. I had the Enchiladas and it was superb. Couldn't get enough of it. I also had the soup of the day and really enjoyed it. The waitress really made good recommendations. They also offer a Mexican Sauce called La Costena and I loved it so much. Gives a unique flavor to the food. I will definitely return on my next trip to Singapore

We visited Haji Lane earlier in the day, and two of us were craving some Mexican after weeks in Bali. Piedra Negra hit the spot. They make the guacamole in front of you, and though it needed another avocado, it was quite good. My enchiladas suiza were quite good, if too much food. This was well worth the visit.

I was living across the road so it was close and a change from the predominantly asian I was eating. I had pork ribs for 17sgd. Small meal compared with other places but adequate for me with the heat. It was a small half rack and a couple of lettuce leaves, a cherry tomato and a couple og spoons of mashed potato. Salad had oil only. It was fresh, hot and tasty but not value for money. Will look elsewhere.

Tonights dining experience was the opposite of when i came here a few months ago. I don't if the management has changed or the chef but i won't eat here again. There were 4 of us eating and no-one had a good meal. The vegetarian choices are terrible unless you like soggy corgette covered in cheese which was the vegetarian filling in each dish. Bland bland bland. The menu description was different to what was served. For you Brits - it was like a Little Chef attempt at a mexican. Avoid this and if you fancy mexican go to margaritas instead. However, i couldn't fault the drinks so stop for a drink after u have eaten elsewhere

So far the best Mexican food ive tried in Singapore. I tried ordering beef alambre, nachos and pork ribs and I wasnt disappointed. The food are well seasoned and bursting with flavors from the herbs and spices. I like how the meat of the pork rib is cooked. Its moist and tender with its yummy marinade. And as a cheese lover I enjoyed my beef alambre and nachos. The staff are very friendly and attentive to the customers needs. The ambiance got that funky vibe as it should be and they play upbeat music to set the mood. Good for after work dinner and drinks

But not good either. We've read the great reviews about this restaurant yesterday. The only mexican restaurant we go to is at Cafe Iguana and seeing that Piedra Negra was rated higher than CI made us decide to check it out. We were there earlier this evening for dinner. The location itself is nice. it is quaint and cozy as were all the restaurants around the area. We didn't have to queue (Thank God!).My boyfriend had Sirloin steak and I have Fish tacos. Fish tacos are fine except they're just that--fried fish and shrimp on a soft flour tortilla with a couple of slices of cucumber and a drizzling of mayo. I would have loved some spice and heat on it.The Sirloin steak wasn't good. It came on a plate with salad greens and mashed potatoes. It was too tender and it doesn't have any texture at all. It felt like biting on a piece of fat.Margarita was okay although a little pricey

This place really cool for hang out, not just with your gf/bf but also with your friends. the food very delicious. You must try it!!!!!

Good margaritas, even better nachos!! Make sure to get no salt on your margarita glasses because they tend to oversalt it and totally kill the margarita. Other than that it is a fun little joint. Will definitely go back.

Located round the corner of Arab street, this is one place you would love spending your weekend. Mostly crowded during weekends, you could consider yourself to be lucky to find a table. Had burritos which were nice and filling, some smoked beef skewers that was succulent, and a bottle of wine. Service was ok . Overall, good value for Money

I read the reviews and they were super helpful. Just got back from dinner and this place is amazing! I come from Arizona and agreed with most of the reviews that it is tough to find a decent, authentic Mexican restaurant in Singapore. I am so glad Piedra Negra exists as I have been craving and missing *real* Mexican food. We get some pretty good authentic Mexican food in Arizona so every other Mexican place in Singapore has been an extreme disappointment; and we have tried what seems to be all of them. We ordered the nachos to start, they were delicious! We got the "vegetarian" ones without the chicken and were pleasantly surprised they had added soft squash, onions and maybe pumpkin to it? They were also layered which was a bonus since we all know when you typically get a plate of nachos all the cheese and toppings are just on the top layer and then you're left with just chips.The margaritas are to die for :) We had simple frozen lime ones and were delighted. I had the flautas tacos and loved them! They were very tasty, ordered the combo so I could try both the beef and chicken. The shredded beef (and I normally don't like shredded beef since it's sometimes too dry for me) was very moist, soft, tender and obviously marinated in some glorious spices. The chicken was also good. Looking forward to coming back very soon! Honestly, the best Mexican food we've had in Singapore and we have been here for 9 years. Plus, the service and staff were so chill and friendly. And the atmosphere is pretty fun as well, you can sit outdoors in the alleyway which is pretty funky. We could also park our scooter in the alleyway which was convenient.Enjoy

Just wanted to say a big 'thank-you' to the staff. As walk in customers on a busy Sat night, our party of six was made to feel most welcome. Our kids (5&8) were made to feel special with the gorgeous sombreros lent to add occasion. We had a fantastic night, the service was exceptional and the food most delicious!!! Will definately come back next time we're in Singapore

My wife and I dined here on a quiet Monday night in late March 2013. Food was tasty and served in good sized portions. Drinks are on the expensive side. Service was fine. If you're in Singapore and in need of a change from Asian food this is worth a try
4
Sure, it's not exactly authentic Mexican -- in the humble opinion of this native Californian -- but it's still one of my favorite restaurants in Singapore. Why? Because it's a lot fun! The restaurant is located on a lively corner in the hip and happening Arab Quarter. Both indoor and outdoor seating are available. They serve up a nice variety of tasty food at an affordable price. Nosh on some food, grab one of their delicious margaritas, sit outside for some people-watching, and have a great time

Just had Valentine's dinner there with my wife. I did a lot of research on the web, and found this place on another website. I am from the southwest US, and have had a lot of Mexican or Tex/Mex type of food in the US; and was a little suspect of going to a Mexican restaurant abroad after having some really bad imitation Mexican food in Europe. But, my wife wanted Mexican food for Valentine's, so that is what she got.All I can say is this place is AWESOME! I was extremely impressed with the food, it was flavorful, well presented and was relatively inexpensive. Singapore can be very expensive for a nice restaurant, but this one felt authentic and tasted even better. It was actually better than a lot of the Tex/Mex places back home, I would highly recommend this place- as I looked at other places with menu prices double Piedra Negra's and they had mediocre to horrible reviews.We also walked down Haji St. afterward and discovered some other cool places. We had a great Valentine's day, due in large part to Piedra Negra. If you are in need of some good Mexican food, all I can say is- do try

You wouldn't expect a Mexican restaurant in an Arab quarter, would you? But there it is. Location is pretty small and when we showed up it was heavily raining. Despite everything being wet outside and the chairs soaking they wanted to seat us outside. Even though we had reserved a table for 5 there was only one available for 4 inside where one had to be squeezed in on a bar chair. Menu comprises all popular Mexican dishes and my tortillas with mushrooms were excellent. Prices are reasonable. As a salsa afictionada I must confess they had the best salsa music I have been listening to in Singapore so far. Unfortunately this place is to small for dancing and no dancers around

Piedra Negra feels like a small cantina in Mexico! The tall seats, the bright colored walls and the really good food. Chips, fresh pico de gallo and guacamole arrived quickly after ordering. Beer selection was good to include several Mexican brands.The shredded beef burrito stuffed with re-fried beans and pico was juicy and spicy.The missing dish was Mexican rice; I asked the waiter and he told me that it's not available since the Spanish chef quit and the new (Chinese) owner took over.Based on what I ate this visit, I'll be coming back with my friends

Great, really great food, fun ambience, plenty of seating options and all round, a true value for money place that delivered on its promise.

Been here over a year, craving decent Mexican food. Unfortunately, Singapore does not know how to cater to this need. Money does not buy culture!Saying that, this place has a cool vibe, great for a drink and to chill. My craving for gaucamole was only slightly satisfied. Still best in Sing. When will restaurants here learn that saving cost by adding as little avocado as possible and mixing out with cheap ingredients not satisfy demand?Still if you must eat Mexican here in Sing, this place offers the best sampled so far. Big plus was the service staff, friendly, efficient and timely

Had dinner here a week of so back, we got a table (a barrel with bar stools) as we walked in. They don't take table reservations after 7:30 (!) and when I called at 7-something, they said I'd have to take my luck as all tables were full. But it was a Monday night, so we got a table when we walked in at about 8:15, but I have to say, for a Monday night, the resto was doing quite full. The decor, similar in its funkiness to its sister concern, Cafe Blu Jaz, is very eye-catching, very unique, very bold. Since it is a eatery, and not just a bar, I wish the seating was more comfortable, and the tables were larger than the size of 2 dinner plates; they have a lot of bar furniture (hand me down from Blu Jaz?). The service was disappointing - slow and indifferent. Once we got our drinks (Mojito) and starter (Nacho platter), the waitress would just smile blandly at us when we caught her eye, but not come over to ask if we wanted anything else! The menu is not extensive, and there is hardly any pork in the menu. For the vegetarians, they have a veggie (mushroom) option of nearly everything on the menu, along with chicken and beef options. I was disappointed to see no Mexican rice or a Chimichanga (which is available in Blu Jaz). The alcohol menu is larger than their food menu (it is, after all, on Arab Street) and the Mojito we ordered was very well made. Good list of Mexican beers on the menu. We didn't order deserts, as is usual with me, so sorry no reviews about that.All in all, not someplace I'll be wanting to go back to
3
Food is just average, we were a group of 5 and we ate nachos, burritos, quesadilas and half the time the waiters don't just bother. A little overpriced for the location and seating on the streets. I feel the place is really overrated. Nothing memorable to take us back there again

It is difficult to find good Mexican food in Singapore but this place is tasty. There are two sections, sit in the back section that opens up onto Haji lane. A nice place for a drink and some tasty food. Parking is difficult to take a taxi
5
Great restaurant, we walked in without a booking (party of 6) and we got a table in few minutes on a Friday night. Food is really tasty (their guacamole is to kill for) and portions are generous, service isfast and the live music is just great. If you look for something else than Asian food or hawkers stalls this is a definite place to go. Will definitely visit again when in Singapore
4
I love going to this place, you can actually book a table outside which is definitely the place to be on a buzzing Saturday night. Food is out of this world and comes in generous portions and wine pretty good too for this kind of joint, though a little on the pricey side (as we found when we studied the bill at the end of our last meal......).
5
We didn't dine here, but we did stop for drinks and appetizers. Elizabeth's margarita was pronounced excellent; it was a more generous pour than most margarits she's been getting in SE Asia. They only carry 3 Mexican beers, but one of them was my personal fave: Negra Modelo. The corn tortilla chips were good and the substantial serving of guacamole exceeded my expectations by a considerable margin. Service was prompt and friendly

We went to Piedra Negra 3 times on our last visit - we kept going back for the fish/prawn tacos - they were awesome. We avoided it on the weekends as it's too crowded/noisy - not our scene really, but great for a quiet meal/drink during the week after a hard day working. We BYO'ed wine, I think they charged us about $20 for corkage

We found this place on a Saturday night. It was busy but we immediately got a table outside and the service was attentive. Our drinks and food came out promptly. The decor is funky and colorful and tables are cozy but not painfully cramped. We didn't experience any of the problems that the negative reviewers found.As for the food, Mexican is one of our favorite cuisines and this place is a perfect spot for a fix in Singapore. Dishes have more of a Tex-Mex style -- rich chicken enchiladas smothered in salsa verde, crisp beef flautas with good spice, tangy guacamole with warm tortilla chips. Everything was knowledgeably prepared with balanced flavors. We opted for a jug of margaritas, which had a nice lime flavor and a satisfying amount of tequila...not too boozy, but we could taste it
