Good selection of favourites but food portion and quality is not comparable with the pricing. Friendly staff and clean environment but there are other cheaper alternatives available.

This is still the one of the best Nasi Padang around Singapore. It is not exactly cheap but it is worth it. The sotong, rendang beef/chicken and mutton are highly recommended.

You can eat there or takeaway. My favourite is the curry fish head, rendang, sambal bri jal, sambal sotong. The price is reasonable and the food us delicious.

My Singaporean friend took me there. Itâ€™s a historical restaurant brand serving Indonesian cuisine in Singapore. Price is not cheap but food definitely worth for the price.

Restaurant with good local food but lacking in good customer service. Need to learn from Din Tai Fun where the service and food is par excellent...making visit an overall pleasant experience.

Loved the begedil, with a variety of curry and sauces to whet your appetite, this restaurant offers real comfort food (in an Asian context).

This Singapore style Nasi Padang is still very good and the standard has been maintain over the years. My family and relatives have been eating at this restaurant for more than 50 years and we continue to do so especially when we have overseas friends visiting. Food is as good as ever and although many people complain about the prices we find it reasonable. You can never find the taste of their curry anywhere else

It was highly recommended by our friends, mention that he has eaten this nasi padang since his younger days. We have ordered many type of cuisine, curry chicken, rendang chicken, mutton, vegetable,chandol etc. You will need to select the dishes from the front counter, thereafter you get seated and they will deliver the food to your table. It is not very crowded during a Friday night, however the food is very delicious and tasty. The friend who recommended mention that the taste remain unchanged and always taste as good everyday. We managed to complete all the food, will definitely be back and bring my family to eat. Highly recommended, but price is slightly a bit expensive

My brother in law had taken us to this place 30 years ago ( different location in a Hotel ) , they have moved to a shoppping mall area , still ran by the same family who started the business 70 years ago ! The cuisine remains exactly the same everytime we go , the taste so good and unique that we returned everytime we visited Singapore . The decor is simple and clean, you ordered through a line ( cafeteria style ) , they will bring the different items once heated up or prepared appropriately . Kind of semi self service ( do not expect very good service , you come for food ) . We usually ordered a lot and share family style ( with white rice ) , beef and chicken rendang , korma chicken , sambal prawns and fish , good vegetable and desert too . Barley tea is a must too.( help to neutralize the spices ) Theses kind of places are getting harder and harder to find in Singapore . We hope this family will continue running the restaurent for a long time , so my grandkids can enjoy !

Probably the only nasi Padang restaurant that we have thAt's in a air-conditioned with a nice deco. At good place to go if you want to sit, talk and still have reasonably good nasi Padang. By the time we're there, there were limited choices but it's still tasty

Had our family Sunday Brunch there and boy were we surprised at the price at the end. Lunch for 7 adults cost almost $150. I personally think it is way better going to any Indonesian restaurant for their Padang curry instead.

Finally we found this restaurant tucked away on the second floor of some building. It could have been better signposted as we were on a stubborn trail to locate and taste the famous 'Nasi Padang'......a feat finally accomplished after much enquiry and stop start walk ! There is a wide selection of curries and dishes , from seafood to meat and vegetables. The aroma of the strong pungent curry certainly gets up your nose ...but the food itself will guzzle its way down your windpipe! With ease( not too spicy) with agony( over spiced) so be sure to ask, than be sorry

A rare gem...the ambience felt like transported into the 60s of old Singapore from the furniture to the staff uniforms. The only thing sticking out is probably my iphone and ipad on my table:p Dine into delicious nasi padang and chat about the good old times while overlooking into Singapore river. Order at the counter and choose what you want n go pick a table of your choice. Will definitely be back again!

They used to be located at the Rendezvous Hotel on Bras Basah Road and has relcoated to the 2nd floor of The Central Mall, next to the Singapore River.The decorations is like an old kopitiam style with vintage furnitures. It is very pleasant and relaxing experience to dine here. You will also be able to get a good view of the Singapore River from the dining area.They are known for their Padang food. The food are freshly cooked and displayed behind the glass. You select what you like and they will be brought to your table.We ordered begedil, chicken curry, lamb curry and tempei fried with chili and beans. They also provide different kinds of gravy. The sambal chili sauce is especially good.Overal, the food is tasty and not too salty.

Visited Rendezvous Nasi Padang Restaurants with colleagues. This restaurant is located at The Central @ Clarke Quay, direct access from Clarke Quay MRT. Restaurant can be very packed during lunch hour 12.30pm - 1.30pm on Monday - Friday (located in the main business district with lots of office crowd); reservation recommended. Some tables has Singapore River View.Waiters and waitresses speak simple English. Customers order food first, get seated, food served. Payment at the cashier after meal. Nonya food is always tasty but can be little spicy. Good choice of Nonya desserts too. Best matched with lime juice.Enjoyed

As a nasi padang and peranakan food lover, I think I know what is considered good and value for money. Sadly, Rendezvous Restaurant doesn't come anywhere close. My family went there with another family for dinner and we ordered a wide array of dishes. The taste and quality was merely average, even a simple 'begedil' was disappointing (not that it was bad, just that for that price of one, you would expect a lot more). Will definitely not return nor recommend it to friends or relatives

Despite (or perhaps of) the tiny menu, it did not disappoint. Standards gave been maintained with the dishes I have tonight, especially the curry chicken given a subtle fruitiness with its cinnamon undertones. The giant prawn was just undercooked so that it came out perfectly when reheated.

I still have fond memories of the restaurant from the 1990s when it was in the Rendezvous Hotel. As such, I can't resist sneaking in from time to time as I love nasi padang cuisine. Though I have been in the Central @ Clarke Quay location a few times now, each time I feel it deteriorate further. The food is less tasty, there is little choice, the staff isn't particularly friendly and the prices are simply not justified - given the quality of the food. What a comedown for a once-great restaurant

We've been to Rendezvous countless times in the past and always had a good meal. This was our first visit since they moved out of their old place.The food here was pretty much the same as I remembered it. We had the chicken bagadil, which tasted like any other but at 3 times the price. We also had the chicken curries, egg plant and a few other dishes. Lunch for 6 came up to close to $90 which was decently priced. All in all, it was a fantastic meal, everyone was stuffed and had a great time.Here's the sinker. Central is one oddly built mall. We went up the escalator and instead of going to the 2nd floor, we ended up on the 3rd, so we had to go down again on a separate escalator. When we finally arrived at Rendezvous, the gruff and impatient guy at the counter was such a put off cos he wasn't very friendly and was trying to rush us through our order.When we were seated, an unsmiling waitress took our orders for drinks and towards the end of the meal tried getting us to order desserts. We left.Seriously guys, would it kill for you to smile and provide some warmth in your service

This place which serves delicious Nasi Padang has always been a family favourite. Though they have relocated from the Rendevouzs Hotel, they maintained their original nostalgic decor with kopitiam tables, chairs and historical photos of old Singapore. This location has offers diners a good view of the Singapore River but can never replace the fond memories and special place the previous location has in my heart
