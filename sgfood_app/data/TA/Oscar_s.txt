Atmosphere is good but food are not much variety to choose.Staff are friendly and location is best for those who do not have their own transport.
3
Some Japanese food because lots Japanese tour group staying at hotel....also some Chinese food ( porridge was good) Western like omelet station + pancakes+waffles..ok..food...server is too busy... Restaurant is too busy in the morning..they thought i left.. After 15min starting to eat...
5
Wide variety of food is available. Interior looks like fine dining place. Overall experience is very good.
3
They have both buffet or a la Carte. We ordered the Indian dishes. The preparation was good however the options for Indian breads (Roti, Nan, Paratha) were quite limited. We expected more for the price we paid.
3
Spread not many. Service a littke slow for lunch buffet. Laksa cannot make it...very diluted gravy. Nice ambience and decor though. Cakes also tasted so so.
4
Love their service and foods.
Food is really good value for money.
Love their Service, they are very attentive.
Atmosphere, great place to have a brunch with family or friends.
5
Had a fabulous dining experience. I love their food and can't help to get more of their seafood friedrice and salmon. And I loved their raspberry cheescake and ice cream for dessert. The staffs there are friendly and accommodating. Had a fab time with friends and will definitely come back.

Very limited variety. Food on the salty side. Was not crowded during lunch. Service is prompt. Restaurant manager is friendly. DIY salad counter with the cheese drum is very yummy. Waffles should be made upon order unless turn over rate is high. Waffles condiments and ice cream good. I thought the Lady on the general reservation line is quite rude. I asked to spilt bill as we are using AMEX Platinum and she asked 'Who give you permission to do that?" I was shocked and asked why do u mean I need permission to enjoy my credit card privilege?. She then replied, "Oh. What is your question?". I used to be a regular at Lobby Lounge but have stopped 3 yrs ago when the standard of the weekend high tea dropped tremendously. I will visit again for salad and waffles if I am paying only 50%.

Oscar's supposedly offers one of the best buffets in town. To be fair, it was decent, but nothing stood out.Seafood was fresh and within expectations. Hot food stations were ok. Good leg of lamb, standard fish and chicken dishes. The cooking station offered Laksa. Not the best Laksa around though.The cheeses were absolutely dreadful. Dry, hard, limited and uninspiring. Dessert too was dismal and again limited and uninspiring. There seems to hardly even make an effort to present the desserts in an appetising manner with heaps of fresh berries and fruits one sees at other buffets.For the price of $83++ for a weekend dinner, or nearly $98 after taxes, it wasn't value for money
4
I would say absolutely great service and value for money especially if you use Amex Platinum cards. The service lady host went out of her way and provided us Naan bread complimentary even though that was not part of the buffet. I always think little things like these which don't cost a whole lot of money for the restaurant but can significantly uplift a service experience of the customer. The Caser sala display was one the best that I have ever seen in any restaurant. Very creative.. well done! What can the do better ? - I would just say have more options in the buffet spread. Eg. - the cold buffet had sashimi and prawns... may be add Sushi variety?- the hot live counter had wok fried vegetables... maybe add some meat and white rice available as that could easily end up with an extra dish without adding a whole lot of cost
3
Not many dishes to select from....disappointed with the number of choices
Bread and cheesevwere fresh, nice and yummy.
4
Not sure of the cost here because it came with my room stay at the Conrad, but the quality and quantity were impressive and made for a good meal with very good service as well.
5
The lunch buffet has a good spread and the seagood are very fresh. We are very impressed with the good service.
5
Awesome spread of food & very good service with cozy environment great for family & friends to enjoy!
4
Celebrated a friend’s birthday at The Oscar’s. The buffet spread was good for lunch. Seafood on ice was very fresh and the roast beef was superb. Nice ambience with friendly staff. Not forgetting to comment the extra effort to offer us the waffle with ice cream though we went too late and counter is preparing to close. What’s more? A lovely complimentary cake was presented to the birthday girl! Thumbs up
4
I was today for try they’re burger,all hand made from the dough to the patty.I love burger but was fews months without eating one cause the average quality in the city is quite low.Guy this one is amazing,juicy,full of flour from the patty,the Asiago cheese,the Parmesan,the low kick of the chiplote mayo,of course is a bit pricey compare with some other place,but is worth every $Good job Chef !!
3
Food is fresh and good especially the oysters and prawns. However Sashimi is cut into pathetic cube shape instead of slices and the limited selection of food put us off. We are paying almost $100 per pax but the selection is way below expectation.Service is thumbs up and excellence. However for the price with the limited food selection, will not go again
4
Nice hotel coffee-house level buffet lunch, with all the usual favourites, like oysters, sashimi, cold meats, as well as local Asian favourites - there's something for every taste ! Decent value for money, with a good range of house wines by the glass. Friendly attentive service staf
2
My very 1st time here with my colleague. Although is paid by company but is not worth. Very limited selection and the food quality isn’t that great as other published. A little corner of seafood ranging from oyster, calm, prawn, sashimi..that’s all...Salad bar selection is less than average while the cook food is the usual stuffs you going to get at the restaurant (no need to go buffet ;))..Service were poor, even ice water we got to fetch and pour it ourselves. Not to mentioned the coffee and tea order when hair wired. My colleague waited for good half an hour for their tea to be served and it was a 2nd reminder. The staff Face were “black” during their 2nd reminder. Never ever I will go for the beverage.Oh well, you can imagine what you will be getting to dine in here. Just a disaster. Nope, not recommended
3
The lobby employee that shown me the way to the restaurant was very helpful.The atmosphere of the restaurant was okay, but I think it is quite small for a buffet restaurant in a hotel.The noodles section is at outdoor, most people are unaware of it.Waiter/waitress can be more prompt in keeping the used plates.Overall, the varieties are quite little, can improve on it, but quality still okay
4
The place is nice and the atmosphere is great. We enjoyed ourselves in the dinner buffet. Just one point to note is that the sashimi selection is limited, just salmon and tuna.
4
Yummy waffles and ice cream. Good selection of seafood and food variety.
Staff could be more attentive, however, could be due to the busy festive period where tables are full.
5
Lovely place to dine. Parking was a breeze with lots of parking lots so no stress at all.
Very attentive, genuinely friendly staff & a comfortable experience. Food was good.
4
Felt that standard has dropped. Rather disappointed and will probably not return. Not value for money.
5
Went to the buffet on Monday. The seafood section was over the top, with really fresh oysters and sashimi. The hot food section was satisfactory. There were also many kinds of deserts. If you drive, remember to ask for complimentary parking coupons.
3
I went with high expectation considering this is a restaurant in Conrad. The spread was not really good. The only good I found was Fresh Oyster. Salmon belly was not served as we were told it depends on what the kitchen served. Laksa was abit too salty. The noodles were just normal. Thankfully we were attended by great serving staff. Will only want to remember the nice friendly staff. Would not pay such price to eat again
3
At first glance, there seems to be a great selection of buffet spread. However, upon closer look, it is not so. The restaurant has merely put out many different types of condiments, and sauces etc thus creating the impression of a great spread. Additionally, the pasta salad tasted horrible. The pasta was so hard and tasted uncooked! The rest of the food was just average.However, I enjoyed the pork rib soup , salmon sashimi and fresh prawns. The ambience and the service were alright
5
We are normally not big buffet people however this one is an exception as the selection is well picked, chefs constantly checking the quality and fair amount of live cooking. Attitude of the staff is fantastic, they are there when you need them and let you be in your space when you require. Very balanced service and super friendly. Salads selection as well as cheese and soups were appreciated by us. Main course was indeed overwhelming as so much to choose from so we decided to taste nearly every item and it was without exception very good. Hot food is served hot and that certainly noticeable
5
My wife and I were looking for a special restaurant to treat her sister for Christmas. We arrived 30 minutes early and saw that there was an amazing shopping center (Suntec City) right across the street; so, great location. The welcome was warm; a personal 'butler' catered to whatever we wanted to drink, even offered suggestions for choices to fit our occasion. A wide selection of salads, hors d'oeuvres, soups, entrees, and desserts. It was especially to have 'Chopes' (10%) vouchers ready-to-use as soon as we booked our reservation. We will certainly return
1
Having been to Beijing Hilton, Shanghai Waldorf, Hong Kong’s Conrad and among other Hilton brands of hotels this is by far the most disappointing experience I had and I am not referring to the accommodation but rather the experience at Oscar’s. As I was going to utilise the restaurant’s voucher ( complimentary from UOB Infinite ) I called to made a reservation as instructed on the voucher. After providing my particulars and my preferred date & time I heard a series of murmur from the lady on the other side of the phone and before I knew it the call was ended, abruptly and much to my shock. It sure sounds like a slam on the phone although i told myself that It is not possible and I should have heard wrongly giving the benefit of doubt. I made another call few hours before my scheduled time again ( I would not want to be embarrassed in front of my guest least the table is not available ) to get a confirmation on my reservation. This time the lady at the other end who answered my call sounds professional, lively and most importantly spoke with clarity. This somewhat wins back some level of confidence. Expectations turn into disappointment again when we arrived. Nothing wrong with the reservation as it went smoothly. I did also noticed a petite lady staff which was very patient and show professionalism during my witness of a customer complaint which she handles very well, I could not say the same about the rest of the staff which shows an “enormous amount of lacklustre” and lack of service enthusiasm. To to be honest it somewhat affected our appetite although the buffet spread was also quite limited and thin which was the main reason. The coffee which we ordered took about 15 minutes to arrive and after a few reminders. My guest was rather understanding citing reasons that the staffs may be already tired since it was already 1pm+ and that peak hours may have passed hence the buffet varieties is understandably thin. I could just simply go on and on because it was such a disappointing experience for me and to think that this is the first time visiting “our own Singapore’s Conrad” despite being a Hilton member. Enough said. The above is the original feedback I have sent in about 10 days ago and there were no service recovery of any sort. Come to think of it , I just remembered that when we are about to leave the two male staffs came to the table and sort of squeezed their way to our table beside my two female guests and starts to clear the plates. I mean , can't they wait for just one minute until we are gone ? What is the hurry whereas all that time while we were eating they seems more interested in talking among themselves rather than serving us
2
Despite the increase in price, the quality and quantity of the buffet have drastically dropped. Disappointment.
3
First time trying their buffet as I've read good review about their buffet. Wide variety of choices but slightly overpriced.
Could get better quality food in a decent restaurant with the buffet price.
4
My experiene of the Sunday Brunch was a good one. Food was nice, service was great. Although the choice could be more.
3
The service were excellent and the food were fresh. However, the buffet itself was a letdown. The spread was not impressive as compared to other similar buffets of the same price. It makes me wonder how such a place can win the "Best Buffet" award.
4
Like the ambience..good variety of foods but it will be better if the foods can be less salty. Serving staff can be more friendly though☺☺☺
2
The restaurant took forever to locate the Chope reservation. it would have been much faster to have been a walk-in customer.
Food and service was OK once seated but you've go to get a table first ....
3
Fresh food, efficient staff, though not particularly festive atmosphere. Seafood and Soups especially good. Deserts disappointing
3
Made reservations via Chope which was fast and good because we could get $10 off when we purchased the $100 cash voucher to be used during payment. Variety of food not much but food tasted good. Service was prompt and good. Overall was a pleasant experience.
5
The Oscar's is a nice restaurant serving buffet lunch & dinner at the Conrad centennial Singapore.fresh Canadian oysters,nonya kuey pie tie,grilled home made waffles,roasted beef,sushi & many other seafood are available but menu changes every now & then ,service staff was prompt & friendly,although the spread of food was a bit less during lunch,but I'm overall pleased with the experience.
3
For a place that was this expensive, there really isn't much on offer. It was also supposed to be festive-themed but apart from the turkey and one flavour of log cake, there was nothing else. Not to mention the oysters gave my party of 4 diarrhea.
3
Service was lacklustre . The menu has reduced to no cold drinks and there was no birththday cake even though I had stated in the reservations,
5
The service was exceĺlent and the buffet spread was comprehwnsively great.
We got a quiet table and had a good time feasting and fellowshipping
4
Spread was good. Delicious food. Seafood was fresh too. Very nice of the restaurant to give us a complimentary cake for my husband's birthday! :)
2
Service is good, but seafood not much choices to choose, with the amount we paid at least have some crabs for all time buffet
4
Good and prompt service experienced. Love the beef, prawn noodle, laska, Kueh Pie Ti, waffles with ice cream and oysters.
5
Absolutely wonderful experience at the Supercharged Sunday Brunch!! Extensive selection of high-quality food; our favorites were the freshly grilled lobsters and rib eye steak. Service was also excellent.
3
Visited this place last month with a group of friends. Location wise. Convenient and the nearest mrt is Promenade. Ambience is good very quiet. Buffet spread is not top notch comparing some of the nearby hotels. Buffet dinner on the high sight even after CC discount. If this is the first time going. Can give a try but I will not go back there again.
4
This is the restaurant for the Conrad Cennential Hotel in Singapore. It is situated in a fairly big, light and airy room.The breakfast dishes on offer are very extensive and cover both Western and Oriental food. Service on coffee and fruit juices was very good, and the self service area had hot food kept at a good temperature, unlike so many other buffet restaurants where the hot food is cold
1
One of the worst dinner buffet I have tried. Spread was limited and quality of food extremely bad value for the price you have to pay. The noodles station was its 'saving grace' but you have to go outside of the restaurant to get the hot bowls of noodles and then come back in to the restaurant via a heavy set of doors! There are definitely much better dinner buffet options out there. And to make it the worst experience, the restaurant is noisy, rowdy and simply a very cramped place
4
First time i came to oscar's to celebrate my friend weddind dinner.. food is nice and one of the service staff Amin did a great job. He is an asset to your restaurant and always ready when we ask for service. Will be back again her
5
Conrad never failed me with their food selection & Sunday brunch was no exceptional. Keep up the good work, Conrad.
3
I went with my family to celebrate my Husband’s birthday. We found that the choice of the food not many. The fresh oyster very salty. Very disappointed.
3
The atmosphere is fine but the international buffet spread is very limited.
Not value for money!!!!!
4
Wide variety of food to select from. Including eastern and western dishes. A selection of salads, cold seafood and deserts. Very welcoming and attentive staff.
4
Limited food selection and the price is too expensive. But service is very good and place is very nice.
4
That ever Oscar's does, they try to do their best!
Awesome western, asain sections and salads.
The noodle bar is pretty bad though, pity. The noodles are too soft.
5
Always a favorite with our family when they are visiting and something for everyone on their buffet.
Wide variety and fresh!
2
Service and food quality has deteriorate over the years. Might be the last time we come here after so many years.
4
oscar's is where we had our breakfast. It serves a varied menu which includes western style breakfast.
5
Shout our to the Assistant Manager Fernando and his team! Very nice guy and gave us an exceptional quality awesome service! Please give this guy a good commendation as he really is the most accomodating and friendly staff we have met in Oscar's Conrad Hotel! Keep it up guys! Plus the food here is soooo yummy..u can ask the chef or waiter for ice cream as they hide it inside hehe but was really yummy! Also they seeve fresh seafood like oyster even for lunch! Good service and pricing plus quality food and nicest staff! Thanks Sir Fernando for taking of us during my mom's bday! He even asked his team to sing a bday song for my mum and gave as a yummy choco truffle cake! Thank u guys!!!! Thanks Fernando
5
Buffet was very good. Wide spread of food and the dessert spread was my favorite. Service was also good.
4
Most of the food was delicious. And I can safely say that I sampled 90% of the food since variety was limited. Efficient and non-intrusivr staff. Good for family.
3
Food spread was very limited, the potato soup was very diluted and the watercress soup was so sweet and the whole soup was looking grey.
5
We had a very enjoyable lunch buffet here, the spread is really good and in my opinion better than other lunch buffets in town. The standard of engredients and variety of food is great. The staff are very professional and friendly. The atmosphere is very comfortable. We will definitely go back for more

I’m not a buffet person but I’ve been to Oscar’s supercharged Sunday brunch buffet 3 times, because the first 2 visits in the past year have left with me a very good impression of the food and ambience there. However, the 3rd visit is a total disappointment. For the first 2 times our favourite dishes have been foie gras and Indonesian style fried crab. This time round with the new menu, the 2 dishes are no longer available. We thought it was then a good opportunity to try out the new egg station and grill station. Well, the egg is okay, though it could be better by e.g. serving with Parma ham. The grill station was disappointing as the lobster tend to be under cooked. When we ordered the lobster the 1st round we found 1 that was half raw. Then when I ordered the 2nd time I specified that we prefer to have the lobster “well done”. However, there was still 1 out of the 2 lobsters that was half raw. We feedback to the staff and she immediately changed for us, so I would still give credit to the staff and service. But overall, the food selection and quality is not as exciting as before so it is now just an average international buffet to me.
3
This was our second visit to oscars after the fantastic first time a month back. I wished we didn't return. The food wasn't as great - fine, maybe it's just tonight. What really ticked me off was the dismal lack of service. Servers were flitting around, avoiding eye contact with diners. It took half an hour just to get a pot of tea for our table and the ice water requested at the same time - nope, it didn't make it to our table. Must've been held up in Narnia. The kicker? The restaurant was HALF EMPTY.
4
Since we had not tried Oscar’s before, we decided to go for their buffet lunch.Though the spread is limited but quality of food is not bad. The oysters and sashimi were fresh and double boiled chicken soup was good too. The roasted beef ribeye was also good and the chef had it cooked well done in the kitchen as it was too rare for my taste.Only thing is the noodle bar outside the restaurant was hot while waiting and with the tray in hand, it was a little difficult to open the door into the restaurant. Besides I saw some birds flying into the noodle bar section. Overall service was also prompt and good despite the place was nearly full.Will be back to try their dinner and Sunday brunch
4
Had a great dinner experience here at the Oscar’s. We were initially given a table at the non-conditioned area outside the restaurant. But not too long into the dinner, the kind waiter ushered us to a table which was just cleared after the guest left. This gave us greater comfort to dine as the weather in Singapore was as usual warm and humid outside.The dinner buffet came with a good enough selection. What was worth mentioning was the Durian station located at the outdoor area of the restaurant. The durians were newly opened, fresh and were of good quality. We were informed that they were D24 grade. There were disposable gloves, wet towels and even iced water to ensure that you don’t smell like a durian after eating them. The service was generally good, and the ambience was nice for a cozy family dinner gathering
1
1) Seth Lui’s blog showed photo of oysters from 5 different nations, however only New Zealand oyster was available during my visit. 2) Laksa gravy is too sweet for Singaporean liking. The beef noodle and prawn noodle were no where close to hawker centre standard. Tourists may have a bad impression of hawker food after trying out the noodle bar. Please do not give authentic hawker food a bad reputation!3) Poor selection of foodRecommendation:Ditch away noodle bar if the hotel cannot meet hawker centre standard. Emphasize more western hotel style food:
2
The food spread is limited, not much choice, not special. No sushi, oyster offerred is small. Laksa is good. Fruits is also limited choice. Staff not attentive when utensil runs out. Will not recommend friends to frequent this restaurant. Definitely, there are many others much better than this in term of food spread.Not worth the $ spent
4
My friend recommends Conrad have good Laksa, so I tried that before I went to airport. I tried the lunch buffet, great food, Laksa at outdoor noodles bar, great staff service. I would recommend people to try
4
Pleasant evening, relaxing dinner. Nice ambience. Good quality food. Reasonable spread, not special. Rather crowded so a little noisy.
5
variety not big but the food is fresh and well cooked. i like the oyster, shrimp on ice and sasimi. desert also not bad.
4
The staff is nice & warm, attentive to your needs. The spread is fairly decent although the cuts of food could be more generous & the replenishment more attentive. Nonetheless, makes for a good meal.
5
After a one year search, I have finally met my one true buffet love - oscars! Even though the selection was smaller than other buffets, the food and service quality was top notch. Dreaming of my next visit
4
Overall , the experience is great but the top up could have been more frequent and food variety could be expanded
4
Food quality was good but spread was a little limited for the price of $83++ for dinner buffet. The cold seafood section had fresh and nice oysters, crayfish, prawns and clamps. The dessert were all very good. It is good that they scoop the ice cream for diners instead of letting diners scoop the ice cream themselves as diners make a mess of the ice cream station. Service was good and staff were attentive
4
Loved the atmosphere of the place. Food wise above average, suggest that they rotate the buffet line more frequently so that they will get more repeated customers. Didn't enjoy the service during my last visit though, had to pile up my used plates high before the waiter notices, had to remind them a few times to clear the plates too. Great place to bring your kids
3
I went for lunch buffet, very less selection. The japanese section, only have Tuna & Salmon sashimi. That's it, no sushi. Pumpkin soup with no pumpkin taste. The best are the salad & ice-cream. The hot food not much selection and most with chilli. We will not go back again.
2
I went there for dinner on Saturday. The place was quite full, even though I have made reservation, we were shown a table for two that was very close to the next table. Not happy with the table shown to us, we were about to leave but managed to get a corner table that was just vacated. The ambience was more like a cafeteria rather that a restaurant in a five star hotel. The food in the buffet was quite limited. There were two types of oysters, prawns, crayfish and clams. The clams had hardly any flesh in them. Quite disappointing. There were two types of sashimi, tuna and salmon. Choices of salad were also limited. There were breads with three choices of cheese. There were roast beef and pork belly. The rest of the cooked food was not good, the Indian dishes were oily and the Chinese food looked unappertising. The desserts were also limited, with cold soy bean curd, fruits and small range of cakes. Only the Movenpick ice cream and waffles were good. For $83++, it's definitely not worth going for this buffet
4
Many choice of food and refill promptly where when it going to finish. Very fresh oyster. Drink are serve from plan water, coffee to fruit juice!
4
We went Oscar for birthday celebration. The service crews are very sweet. They have prepared a birthday cake for us. Although there are not many variety of food, the food, dessert, and the fruit are very delicious.
4
Pleasant and efficient service, plus a decent selection of food. Apart from not having prawn noodle available (I was hanging out for this one) at the noodle station outside despite it being written on the signboard at the station, the spread was varied enough to satisfy most bellies. The oysters were fresh and delicious, as too was the rest of the seafood spread. Good tasty variety of hot foods & salads & your run of the mill desserts of which I recommend trying the ice creams.
4
Heard so much about their choices of fresh oysters and was not disappointed. The cooked prawns and lobsters were just as sweet and juicy. They have two desserts spreads - the usual you can find in any international buffet, and a selection with durians as the main ingredient. Perhaps a seasonable feature, I was also pleasantly surprised that Oscar's had a durian stall stationed at the open area. The quality of the D24 was good, creamy and small seeded, you can eat all you want and the price is included in the buffet. It did not burn a hole in my pocket after some credit card discount. Regrets that there is no sashimi
4
Visited this restaurant for a weekday lunch buffet. The price pp is $59++ and starts from 12 to 2:30 pm. The buffet spread includes fresh oysters, sashimi (salmon and tuna) and cold prawns which we had many helpings. Of special mention is the roast beef which is roasted perfectly to medium. You only need to add some sea salt to bring out it's full flavor. The laksa station (noodles) is located outside the restaurant and has nothing to shout about. The lobster ball added to the laksa taste like bought from the supermarket. For the dessert, you need to leave some room for the waffle which is freshly prepared which goes well with the chocolate ice cream. We ended our delicious lunch with a cup of cappuccino
1
Only try if you have a lot of spare cash and have no where to spend (:If only there was an option to rate 0 stars. This restaurant is totally not worth the price you are paying for.I ended up at this restaurant after reading the fabulous reviews written by the local food bloggers and influencer, raving about how good the meat (beef and lamb) were. We were delighted upon arriving however, after enquiring and checking out the food, we realised that this restaurant does not even have a meat station. How is this even possible. International buffet with no meat station?! ARE YOU KIDDING ME? Limited buffet variety, risotto had a soapy mama lemon taste as if the pot was not properly washed. Laksa was very diluted. The only good thing was the roasted duck. Based on the food quality and variety, it does not justify the amount that I am paying. We paid about SGD 80-ish per pax
5
Sunday Brunch: fab, fun and fresh!! Staff were friendly & the selection incredible for price. The Sunday brunch was one of our trip highlights. The seafood is in abundance and good quality too. There are large prawns, lobster done three ways, a 3 meat carving station, a commendable salad bar with interesting combinations which make you want to actually eat salad, the gin bar is great fun outside as is the make your own sorbet station. Thoroughly recommend.
4
We were looking for somewhere that offered some local food choices and some seafood. Went to Oscars planning to order a la carter and ended up going with the buffet which was reasonably priced and the seafood was divine! Fresh and tasty. The black chicken soup was interesting and tasty as were some of the other fusion dishes. Wine list was extensive and reasonably well priced for a fancy hotel dining room. Staff were absolutely adorable and very helpful. Really helpful with gluten free dining selections. A fun night. Would recommend as a nice but easy dining experience.
5
Celebrated my anniversary at Oscar's. Didn't expect a cake from them. Service was impeccable. Seafood was pretty fresh. Go early if u want better quality food. First round there were huge chunk of cooked cod, chopped unagi for kueh pie tee & large oysters but these were not available when I had my second round
4
I reserved using Chope for Oscar's famed Supercharged Sunday Brunch, and I have to say that after that amazing meal I was indeed SUPERCHARGED (my wallet too HAHAHA). The lighting is bright yet gentle, with amazing waiters and waitress that cleared my plates instantly. My drinks were also quickly refilled, which made me felt like a king. There is a wide variety of dishes to choose from. If you feel carnivorous, the meat section which features rib-eye, roast duck and roast pork (my favourite, so succulent and juicy) is a must-go! There is also a whole section dedicated for seafood lovers with abundance of oysters from NZ, Canada, Australia; Boston lobsters; parts of King crab and huge platter of fresh sushi and sashimi! Desserts wise could be better as most were too sweet, with few selections. If you fancy salad, there is a salad bar with loads of ingredients and couple of self blended drinks (must try)! Don't forget that the alcoholic drinks counter, pasta stall and charcoal grill are located outside the dining area. The grilled lobster was fantastic, but the rib-eye was too bland. Pasta was excellent!Overall, great ambience and expeditious service. Food wise, it's of top quality, with a little lacking in the desserts. Good for value, but it really SUPERCHARGES your wallet! Good thing I used Chope and bought meal vouchers at 10% off :
5
food very fresh, the staff really nice. especially i and my husband with my one month old baby, when we wants to warm the milk . the staff really helpful and give the hot water with big bowl. for the food, really nice and fresh
4
went without knowing that their buffet was peranakan themed for that night. preferred their usual spread, but food was still good.
4
Durians (the real thing, freshly shelled) included as part of the buffet. Good but not intrusive service.
5
Excellent service and wide variety of selections. Food was fresh as well. The Indian food was tasteful but the selection of beverages was limited.
5
I love this restaurant. Everything was great. All food is very delicious. if you have a time, please go & enjoy your dishes.
3
The lunch buffet with heritage food theme during Singapore 52nd birthday served local favourites such as Hainanese chicken rice, fried prawn noodles, sweet sour pork and Singapore laksa (spicy soup rice noodles) in addition to the international food items. However the noodles cooking counter is outside the aircon restaurant. So the guests had to collect the bowl of hot noodles and carefully push through the glass doors to return to the dining table. Would like to suggest to relocate the noodles counter into the restaurant.

Oscar’s is a very popular food outlet at the Conrad Centennial Singapore. It serves buffet breakfast, lunch and dinner everyday and Sunday Brunch, which is highly rated by food enthusiasts.When my wife and I stayed at the hotel we attended the buffet breakfast on five occasions. The ambience of the restaurant was cosy and lively and people seemed to enjoy the food. However, it could become quite crowded and noisy. I have been informed that 400-700 people are served each morning.Oscar’s offers quite a wide range of food for their buffet breakfast - almost twice as many dishes and food items as the Novotel or Crown Plaza hotels in Adelaide, but about half as many as the Pullman Hotel in HK, Mandarin Orchard in Singapore or Shangrila in KL. There were about twenty cooked Asian dishes, including congee (plain, chicken and fish), stir-fried or soup noodles, miso soup, fried rice, dumplings, steamed fish and mild curry, and a large range of foods that are found in European and English breakfasts, including fresh fruit and juices, cereals, pastries and breads, dairy products, beverages, and cold meats. Coffee, tea and juices were brought to the table when guests were first seated. The foods were tasty and flavoursome. It took me five days to try each dish more than once and most of them were enjoyable.The waiting staff worked hard and very well as a team. They removed unwanted dirty dishes as quickly as they were generated and were only too happy to take orders for hot or cold drinks.It would be remiss of us if we did not mention Fernando, one of the team leaders. He has a great personality and the ability of brightening up everyone’s day. I would definitely have breakfast at Oscar’s again. Our ratings are as follows: service 10/10; tastes and flavours 9.5/10; and ambience 10/10

First of all I wasn't expecting stellar fresh seafood for $60++. so i accepted the below-average oysters and scallops. Sashimi selection was so-so (salmon/tuna), but decent in taste. The poached prawns however could not be any better; sweet, crunchy and perfect.The local food items were better than typical, but i loved the beef and roast chicken. Desserts were above average in my experience too. Best of all, the Nonya food items like kueh pie tee, DURIAN PENGAT were perfect!Parking (complimentary) is easily available and accessible. Service was good until the cafe got more crowded, but used plates were always promptly cleared. atmosphere/ambiance could be better if the tables were just a little bigger, or plates a little smaller

Local delights theme with fresh durians! Enjoyed my dinner. I like this theme with the fresh durians.  Its interesting. Very thoughtful of the restaurant to provide disposable gloves, wet tissues n even a water dispenser at the durian area. The food was generally tasty n service was prompt n friendly. The oysters are really plump n sweet. Easily the best oysters i ate this year!Its a small thing, but the sashimi counter was not quite ready at 6pm when the buffet started. Maybe the chef can start preparing a bit earlier. Also, the prawn noodles at the outdoors noodle counter was again not available. This is already my 2nd visit that this happened. A pity as the prawn soup is tasty. It does not give a good impression to have the item listed on the menu, but its actually not available. Its better to remove it from the menu if you are not serving it anymore.Overall, a nice dinner. Thank you

This is probably the first buffet that I was not willing to pay for. Tried the roast, nyonya, fresh seafood, Indian and western section. Nothing impressed except for the awesome satay.Notably poor dishes were the vinegar pork trotters (tasteless meat), cod (overdone), roast duck (lack of seasoning), the risotto (had a soapy tasted) and fresh prawn/crab (tasteless).There was a durian stall. I do not eat durian, and I hope it was beyond fantastic to offset the rest of the buffet spread.I would suggest the restaurant management make an honest reassessment the quality of the buffet spread
3
Dined here a few years ago and was impressed with the spread. But found that the spread now not so much. Also expected durians as written by some bloggers but there were none. Only enjoyed the ambience. Taste was also acceptable but oysters too salty.
3
The local spreads were below average! e.g. oyster omelette; kuay pai-ti; almost all were below average.
Given a whole royal choc cake as complimentary for those who celebrated their Birthday - that's very thoughtful.
5
A great family lunch together after National Day. Quality Food & quality Service... Must try is Herbal Soup & Durian pungat
5
Great consistent food, receptive to feedback and keeping to the high Conrad standard. A whole variety of food with buffets and ala carte menu.
4
Never seen a hotel buffet with durians included and this is my first. Food spread is decent and the seafood is fresh.
4
Oscar's having a local delights buffet with free flow of freshly opened XO and Red Prawn durian. It was a birthday dinner for mum and she was presented with a complimentary birthday cake. Wait staff was thoughtful and service prompt.
1
Just had breakfast at Oscar's and I was not a hotel guest. I read a couple of nice reviews here but I think that is just for hotelguests and probably the buffet is fine. I ordered a omelette and oatmeal wit mixed berries. After 15 min I asked if they knew where my order was. Finally my omellete arrived but I have never received the oatmeal.
3
It was like many years since i last visited Oscars. Experience during the last visit was bad and i avoided that place since. What drew me back recently was the addition of free flow fresh durians to the buffet during the month of August. So, i went last Sunday, 6th Aug and arrived at 645 and the restaurant is already packed. Priced at 78/88++, sun-thurs/fri-satDo bring along your Amex credit card (not co-branded) for 50% off for 2 diners.Food i like in the spread - fresh sashimi like salmon and tuna, kueh pie tee, crabs in kung po style... that's about all. The crayfish were not fresh, i didn't try the prawns or oysters but i heard that they were fresh and good. The live noodle station has a wide selection of noodles but prawn noodles was out by 7pm (when buffet starts at 6) and i tried the laksa, which was ok. The durians for that day was Red Prawn (its dependent on the stocks that are delivered on that day) and it wasn't satisfying. Most of those i tried were not ripe or tasteless. The buffet is cheap, with the discount, at 92 nett for 2 pax on off peak days. But i guess they do have the potential, if they were to beef up the selection.On staff wise, the main servers were quite on the ball during the clearing and offering of drinks. It was the Indian manager that i keep seeing pacing up and down, giving orders to the staff that are clearly swamped. The manager walked past a table which was wet after a kid toppled the glass, and what he did was to walk to the far end to get another staff to wipe the table. Personally, i do not think that it is right. If he were to rush to their assistance immediately, the poor family wouldn't have to grapple with the table full of water that is dripping all over
1
Reached there at 545pm and sat at the couch outside and was approached twice by different staff and was told that the dinner would only start at 6. Did not return to inform when it started while we waited like fools outside until we saw some guests inside. Food variety was so limited and it cost like $93 per pax. Worst buffet ever
5
We had a gathering and celebrated our friends' birthday at Oscar's. There was a complimentary cake prepared for the occasion which was a nice touch.The London Roast duck station was delicious and seafood spread of oysters, lobsters, crabs, prawns were fresh and of high quality.Overall we had a good time here
2
Went to Oscar's after lots of "good reviews" online about the seafood that on offer. Was greatly disappointed about the quality of the oysters and crabs on offer. Especially the oysters, they were so small. Hardly visible
3
The variety and selection of food is very little . I think u can pay the price to deserve more better restaurant
4
The buffet featured a rather small selection of food, but was pretty decent overall. The prawns and mussels in particular were very fresh, but I was disappointed that there was a distinct lack of crabs that were common in buffets charging the prices they do.
4
apparently, their spread includes oyster where most weekday buffet lunch doesn't have. Oyster was great!
The Japanese section is not so great, not much selection.
3
average but expected more for the price. The quality is not too bad but limited variety offered. For a bit more, u would have selected pan pacific or ritz Carlton.
3
The food quality was average for the price. I've had many other better buffets at other hotels at the same price point to be fair. The oysters were quite small and the food selection was not wide enough compared to other hotel buffets at the same price range.
5
Had our fill of lobsters at this buffet. Food was of excellent quality. Service staff were attentive and helpful. My son asked for a lemonade, which turned out to be not on the menu. The staff offered to mix one for us. Drink was delicious and this initiative just made the whole experience even better.

I was looking forward to a nice Seafood Buffet Dinner.Most singaporians have a favourite place they like to recommend.Singapore HAS a great choice in Buffet options.I was informed the seafood here was quite good.My expectations were quite high but was very disappointed in the Seafood Quality.The presentation of the food selections looked very good.I suppose the actual eating was the let down.Small to medium sized oysters with no flavour.Medium sized king prawns which are normally sweeter than the larger king prawns once again no flavour was starting to think this was frozen seafood. NOT FRESH as i was hopefull.The smoked salmon was fine , but the crab legs once again frozen no taste for sure.I suppose im a hard task master but i had the privalege of trying other 5 star hotel buffets before this once hence my let down.Good selection of desserts but we punters come for the Seafood.Other point is your buffet is top dollar it doesnt match with your seafood selection.Maybe its very profitable from the hotels point of view but plainly just damaging to the CONRAD Brand
4
The buffet at Oscar's are well-known and the food is cooked well considering that it is a buffet..what stands out is the warmth of service from the wait staff, Amin and the chef who cooks the noodles outside. Their warmth and professionalism will make your meal really enjoyable
4
The buffet spread was good enough for me though i wish there are more selection when it comes to the cheese (only 3 types). The variety is not that much compared to other buffets that I've attended. The service was excellent and prompt. i feel very welcomed. I had fun staring at the chocolate fondue which couldn't stop shaking
4
This restaurant is on the ground floor of Conrad Centennial and has excellent food and very attentive service staff.
4
We expected a lot more varieties of food at a hotel restraurant. Anyway quality of food is good. Ambiance is good too.
4
Food selections were pretty standard and no cold drinks were included in the buffet. Tables were extremely close to each other. It felt more like dining at a cheap cafe as I could hear the conversation on other table. Will not visit again.
5
Came for lunch buffet, experience was good, but I remember it used to be much better. Seafood selection was fresh although limited, cooked dishes were average, salads were surprisingly yummy, and desserts did not disappoint. Had a voucher, so all in all still worth it!
5
Seats are not far away from food. Friendly staff that make the eating environment very comfortable. Staff by the name of Long made different designs on our cappuccino and mocha.
4
Have been to Oscar for a couple of times and they never fail to satisfy me with their decent spread. I would say Oscar is decently priced for its spread and quality.
4
Oscar's service and quality never fails to surprise me. I was here about 10 years ago and recently I returned for a family birthday buffet dinner. The service is impeccable and the wide selection of food and the quality is highly recommended for diners who wish to bring their family members for a meal. Thumbs up
2
Cannot imagine the hotel actually charges $83++ for such a sad buffet spread! We used the Amex discount and even so, it's not even worth $100 for 2 pax. The variety was very limited. Probably not even half of what The Line has (not saying The Line's great... the only buffet that's worth going is Basilico).We hoped the food quality would be good at least.... Nope.Carving station.... roast chicken. Cold storage has better roast chicken I'd say! Not even a roast? How cheap is that? The sashimi was so badly sliced.... Bite size for babies? The slipper lobster was tough and tasteless. The cooked items were all forgettable. Dessert... They charge so much and cannot even get a decent nonya Kueh supplier???? I won't even expect bengawan solo quality... but seriously... they were stale and didn't taste good.There were a handful of good and acceptable items: oysters were the saving grace(2 types - Ireland and France), kueh pie tee, laksa, ice-cream.Please review your pricing if u r going to serve such cheap menu.
4
The mushroom soup you can taste it was not pre made but rather made by the chef . Not too sweet just enough flavor to make it awesome .Every year they have promotions by credit card hsbc 1-1 which make is worth while with free flow crayfish fresh sashimi, great noya kuek it a diet person nightmare here and my kid agreed with me the mushroom soup it the best he say my19year old teen
2
I am surprised that Conrad has such poor customer service at it restaurant which cannot wait to collect the due for the meal. The station servers displayed stone face on top of it serves cooked from the outside and raw from the inside chicken wings. The waitress was informed and no immediate action was taken to quickly cleared the undercooked away.Very disappointed and sadden by this attitude
5
Oysters, sashimi, Slipper lobster!!!! Lots of lunch buffet out there do not provide oysters. fresh food. Must try the kueh pie tee. Great value
5
Excellent service and food range is superb! Had a great time with my bff and we are looking forward to go back for more. Thank you for the awesome experience. :)
4
A nice place for gathering. Food selection is good. Staff also accomodated our request for some food to be more cooked. Thank you.
5
My second time at Oscar's and they continue to delight. The range of fresh seafood is good and the sashimi and oysters are really fresh. The cooked food caters to the Asian palette and also offers roast cuts. The soup is a must try too.
4
Tip: inform the restaurant if you're celebrating a birthday for a mini birthday song and a cake on the house!
4
I went there for buffet. It was a good experience with some good dishes. probably one of my favorite buffets in town for less than 100 dollars.
4
Great variety of food. I love the noodle counter and the desert section. Awesome service as well. Edmund was very helpful to us. Will definitely come back!
4
Was here on a weekday night and there wasn't much of a crowd. The spread was decent with perhaps 15 warm dishes. Quality was good but I felt that the spread was too few given the price being paid. The salmon sashimi was absolutely fantastic, and so was the caesar salad (which you mix in a rind of cheese). Would not pay full price for the buffet, but if there was some promotion, I would recommend this place.
3
Went here for Father's Day last weekend - Got the Champagne Brunch @S$178 - Compared to similar priced hotels and offerings, the food choice was much smaller, and whilst the food delivery was quick from the waiting staff, the refilling of the drinks was very poor indeed, over my 3 hour period we have to ask 6 times for the glasses to be refilled - Mediium to Good experience in Summary
3
The food was good quality and a good varied selection. Not the biggest brunch but that is okay. I took away a star for the price. $168++ with free flow is on the high end of what other brunches charge with bigger selection of food and better bubbles
5
The variety of the food is very good, their service are excellent & it is worth the money!!
Will definitely come back again!
3
Variety of food is quite limited for a weekday dinner buffet at the price of $72++. Freshness of food is up to standard.
3
Overall food was so so and food selection is very limited. Not value for money. Staff are efficient and friendly staff.
3
Was there for Sunday brunch.After a while the smoke from the outdoor grill was domiating the entire dining hall.Foodchoice was good, but not fantastic. Nice saladbar.Good Gin Tonics!Staff was not always attentive to fill up champagne glass for a free flow, my glass ran empty and I had to ask for more several times
4
Food was great. Love the grilled lobsters, fresh oysters, London duck and the salad bar! The waffles from the dessert section was good too but the cakes can be improved. It was a birthday celebration and Oscar did take note of my request and sang a birthday song with a complimentary cake for the celebration! Really appreciate that :
5
This is one of the best buffet spreads I have seen in Singapore or anywhere. Having said that, it is expensive (if it weren't for an offer we wouldn't have tried it). However, for a really great range of international, Asian, and seafood this is somewhere you'll get it. A good choice of vegetarian too (though not great value if you are - unless you're also on the free flow champagne, which does keep coming), and also good quality desserts. If you want a luxury it will provide it. We went for the Sunday brunch
3
Service was very good, our used plates was constantly cleared and wine was topped up promptly. The sashimi and prawns were really fresh. The oysters seems to be off though. I had the runs about an hour after dinner. Food variety was okay, although it was not really worth the price that we were paying. The food quality was good overall though. Waffles kinda tasted more like hotcakes. Laksa is really good. The herbal soup was more MSG then herbal
5
Daily buffet breakfasts offer a wide range of dishes, with eggs and pancakes cooked to order. Sunday brunch with free flow Laurent Perrier champagne is very good.There is a BBQ station and many other delicious dishes are available, with a wide selection of hot and cold food included. On the weekend, Oscar's stays open continuously from Friday till Sunday so late night revellers can dine at their leisure
3
Having been here a few times in the past, I was slightly appalled to see that the standard of food has dropped quite a bit.My favourite laksa's still good, but the array of seafood was disappointing. Oysters were not plump like before (could be due to the season) and detected some sand in them, prawns were replaced with mussels and it was only about 8pm?Cooked food was pretty alright, though that wasn't the main focus of my why my friends and I headed down to Oscars. We were there for the fresh seafood
5
I found the alternative breakfast dinig option on the 4th floor to be limited in the choices of food available and quite a small area. Oscars is a far better option with great food choices available and attentive staff, some times over attentive when clearing your table, some dishes and drinks were taken away while I was serving myself from the buffet.
5
Great place,with great selection, for a buffet lunch. Their dinner buffets are also amazing. This is one of my favorite buffet places.
5
Excellent service, wide variety of well prepared offerings on the very reasonably priced Saturday buffet. Kid friendly and a well trained professional staff.

I have ate at this place for a decade (2007-now) and I have seen it at its best and its worst... everyone know about Conrad for their fresh shucked Oysters and freshly sliced sashimi, Larger wheel of parmesan cheese for the Caesar Salad, Beautifully roasted Beef/Lamb/ Pork , Local spread with their own twist and delectable desserts. But I have to say it has out live is prime to be mention the place to eat in the marina area.Gone are the guys opening the oyster, freshly sliced sashimi. everything there for the taking. In the past chef talk with their guest which gave us the special touch where we know that we are eating the best as these chefs know what they are doing and explain to us where the food is from and how is was prepared and treated the food wit respect like how they treat their guest. 21 May 2017(dinner) when we when for dinner1) Philippines roast piglet ( soggy crackling and overly salted)2) Pasta section ( sauces was bland and needed a lot of parmesan cheese to help).3) Overcooked Lamb (carving station)4) 2 types of already open oysters.5) cold cuts / sushi / sashimi6) DYI Cesar Salad.7) Bread station (Lovely arrange of bread all of us loved it)8) noodle bar ( everyone loved the laska and has been the item not to be missed)Finally the Poor design dessert section.they use to served an array of praline, 5 types of delicious cake, home make cookies, waffles and another live station (soufflÃ© / crepes / warm chocolate fondant /etc) and a great selection of verrines not forgetting the condiments where my children loved so much.But now all is gone. Many of those that have eaten at this place for a long time have now seen it reach its prime and lost it completely. The guest that ate with me on the May 21 have left missing the prime old days of good food but was left disappointed after years of patronising... The saving grace of the once Prime Oscars is they staff... always attentive, helpful and hard working. **special thanks to Geoffery, for the special arrangement and attentiveness during my dinner
3
Haven't had buffet in a while and thought the spread was decent. There was also unlimited refill for coffee & tea. Was pleasantly surprised that they managed to give us a cake for little sis bday coz we only requested upon arrival. The staff cleared our plates quite promptly but when it comes to replenishing the food, I thought that could be more speedy. The laksa and suckling pig was quite good
4
We had breakfast most mornings for our 7 day stay in Singapore. This place is usually pumping so sometimes you may have to wait for a table. The staff are friendly and efficient, the choices substantial, from eggs anyway you like them, pastries, asian options, salads and many choices of bread.
5
Went for Easter holiday celebration with family & friends. Thoroughly pleased with the wide array of selection of seafood, standard Western cuisine, and some Asian food. Special mention goes to the salad mixed in a large bowl made of cheese slowly being grated along with salad. Desserts (aside from usual fruits) are mostly chocolates and are housed into a separate room (wow!). Make sure you leave some space in your tummy for the desserts. Overall, I find it pricey, but very nice
4
First of, the ambience is great, tiny candles at each table as decorative. The seafood section is delightful. And their cooked food (Asian cuisine, stew lamb, poached salmon) is really amazing. With the exception that they have a limited range of seafood (as compared to the photos posted on their website) and their desert are not very satisfying.Other than that, the quality of the spread is reasonably priced at $70+ after tax.Overall, a delightful experience.
4
I ate breakfast at Oscars several times and really enjoyed it. I have certainly seen bigger buffets in other large hotels but the range of food was more than adequate. What made the buffet particularly good was the quality - everything from the humble dhal through to the waffles were not just good, they were VERY good. I loved the congee bar - so many options! Heaps of western dishes but it was really worth going beyond bacon and eggs. However, I also tried the buffet one evening and while it was okay, it didn't blow me away. I liked the fresh oyster bar however there was only one staff member in the area and he was run off his feet shucking and replenishing items. The salads were okay but nothing to rave about. Even so, I didn't go away hungry but I am not sure it is particularly great value. So breakfast - yes, but for dinner, I think there are better options
4
Second time having the dinner buffet at oscars. Decided to go for dinner buffet on a Sunday and noted that the spread was much better than my previous visit on a Thursday for the same price. My guess is probably there are more people on a Sunday hence more food is served.
4
The food and spread are good.But I hope they bring back the foie gras for the Sunday brunch. We went because of the beef & foie gras but only knew the foie gras changed to egg station when we were there.Also, the nitrogen section should have clear sign board to indicate it is applicable for guests who opt in the alcohol package.1 let down in the service is: 1 staff named Akina ignored us but keep on approach to other guests for their order, even though we were just standing by the BBQ section and very near to her. She kept on passby us to approach others, as if we were transparent.But, Zheng Kang gave a very good and attentive service to our table to overcome it. He gave an extra mile, out of expectation good gesture as well.Oscar's has been our favorite for years. We will still go despite the price
5
Friendly and helpful staff, wide selection of seafood and BBQ stations too. Great king crabs! Lovely choices of dessert and fruits.
5
excellent service from Jenny and her colleague Carmen fr Oscars, when i went there for my bday dinner celebration ; they got me my preferred seating n got me a complimentary nice bday cake
1
We anticipated a larger spread and higher quality seafood spread as it was a special brunch over the easter weekend. Quite a disappointment for an expensive lunch at $88++.
2
The service at Oscars was good but food wise...the selection is very limited and the seafood was not the freshest. For the same amount of money I'm sure there are.m7ch better options available!
5
Fresh seafood and nice dessert. Staff were very observant and attentive.
Good food choice with outstanding service.
2
I visited Oscars for breakfast and whilst the service was good and was shown to a table promptly the standard and presentation of the food was average. I ordered poached eggs on toast and what I got was not presented well see photo. Two poached on top of each other and 2 different pieces toast. Surprisingly the coffee was good.
3
This time we only had the breakfast at Oscar's. Try to avoid the weekend. The staff are overwhelmed. The wait staff is very good. But once again the higher staff, very colonial mentality. We're busy looking to the needs of white customers. Coming from America, being brown am not used to thisToday they were busy, ran out of many things that took them AGES to refill. Simple things like croissants. They should know what to expec
4
Had a brilliant buffet lunch at Oscar's! I feel that it has the perfect balance between quantity and quality, offering a wide variety to appease the hungry diner, but ensuring that the taste of each dish is up to the mark. I especially enjoyed noodles from the outdoor noodle soup station. The waffles at the dessert station were a great bonus, and the chocolate desserts (such as the hazelnut crunch) are a must try! Relatively good value for money for a hotel buffet as well. Service was good and staff attentive, albeit a little slow in clearing plates and topping up water
3
Oscars was one of my most sought after hotel buffets. It had the freshest seafood and a good spread of items. Was there yday and was quite disappointed. Seafood was okie (have the feel is doesn't taste like the freshest). Buffet spread looks limited and desserts were disappointing. Certainly the standards have dropped but still not a bad place.
3
Oscars is convenient if you're staying in the Conrad. The service is excellent but I would like to see a larger set of choices for us Westerners. I wouldn't recommend the buffets unless you're excited to try local and Chinese foods. Just take a peek before you commit. The do have an a la carte menu with a few choices that appeal to the Western palate.
5
Service of the staffs and food are good. But the variety of food not much.... but will definitely go again.... my girls really enjoying the food there... kids will love the waffles with ice cream...... the price per pax is reasonable....
5
We thoroughly enjoyed the food and service. Great food choices especially breakfast. Very efficient and friendly staff.
5
Staffs were friendly and making sure to clear unwanted dishes after we're done :) I don't really like to eat oysters but their France oysters are exceptionally good, thumbs up!
4
Good food, Nice ambience. Service was excellent. The wine provided was of good standard. Will definitely revisit the place in future.
3
Buffet was ok. Liked the noodle bar, laksa was not bad. Taco station and Caesar salad was decent too. Waffles were ok but wonder why no chocolate ice cream
1
food was not replenish promptly, understaff and not value for money. There were ala carte customers as well at the same restaurant and the staff seemed t9 be focus on serving them. I had to clear my plates twice after waiting for quite a long time yet no one came to clear
3
Overall food was good but oyster replenishes slow as it is freshly shucked, cooked salmon was out by 1930ish, service is a slow start hence not recommended for big group of more than 20 especially if you are ordering beers. Wine selection is limited. Ambience is ok, suited for family and maybe friends
3
Visited on 1st April 2017 - 2 mummies + 2 kids on 1st AprilThe same lady was opening oyster and slicing sashimi concurrently, hence diners have got to wait. The male chef tried to help but still needs to attend to his desserts section as well. Not very organize in my opinion. However, oysters were very fresh! Worth the wait! Not much selection for the Japan corner though. Could have been better if there's more choices of food. NO live cooking station for pastas (Our children's favorite) available.
5
This buffet had every regional seafood and most meats imaginable. In addition, scores of cheeses, antipasti, vegetables, fruits, pasta bar, and desserts. The food was plentiful and service was excellent. The room is beautiful as well. It is extremely pricey, but not out of line with Singapore prices, especially given the amazing array of food available
4
The service and staff were fantastic. Though the buffet breakfast lacked a bit in size of spread compared to some other Singapore 5 stars the staff easily made up for this. I would go back. For the kids and young at heart they have amazing ice cream served at breakfast as well
4
If staying at the Conrad, it is a great breakfast with many western and asian choices. I recommend to purchase the meals in advance at the hotel front desk at a discount and not pay the full $45 rate in the restaurant itself.
5
A truly superb buffet experience the amount and variety of food was simply astounding. The entire family enjoyed the evening and we will be back during our next visit
5
Breakfast on three mornings was always a pleasure. Good Food, Good Service. Eggs cooked to order and a good variety of Asian and Western items
4
Very good buffet spread. Love the waffles! Would be helpful if they have more service staff around. Will definitely recommend my friends there!
5
Fantastic food, fantastic staff. Breakfast excellent, buffet dinner excellent. Seafood WOW. Can not rate this high enough.
5
Fresh orange juice, good coffee and a huge selection of western and Asian foods. Great service. The buffet is open from 0600 so foramyone needing breakfast before a morning flight, the opening times will suit
5
Premium buffet.. London duck, boston lobster. Foie gras. Flamed crepe. Oysters. Food of good quality.. Good and attentive staffs.
4
Attended a business function at the Conrad Hotel, Manila on March 6, 2017. It's lobby is spacious. The petals steel structure in the lobby caught my attention. It's just amazing. I like its clean, zen, contemporary and minimalist interiors. It has a huge basement parking lot. There's a Maison Mall connecting to the hotel. The location is great... near Mall of Asia, a church and a bayside.Receptionists are accommodating, and the F & B staffs assigned in the Murphy Function Room offered excellent service. The buffet was generally ok.I will bring my family here very soon for a staycation
5
We've had all our breakfasts here (as HHonors Diamond members they were complimentary, thankfully, as otherwise they would've been quite expensive) and they were absolutely great.The buffet was humongous with a great selection of Western and Asian options.Everything we chose was just of high quality and tasted so good.Service was wonderful, too and the waiters were all very efficient.Highly recommended
5
This Restaurant had such a huge amount of choices. Had hubbys birthday here. Great attentive staff . The food was delicious and the dessert bar wow the best we have seen in a while . Great wine and drinks list a little pricey but that is Singapore in general. If in Singapore go and have a meal her
4
Nice spread of desserts : fruits were sweet & fresh, cakes were good, ice cream n chocolate fondue was very good.
1
For the price of $83++/pax, the variety was pathetic and the food quality was average. I've never seen buffet at such high range with that little amount of food.
4
Nice restaurant for a fancy-ish get together. Didn't try the buffet, had the ala carte. The prices were not cheap but the servings were generous.
4
Visited the restaurant during a weekday afternoon. Restaurant wasn't too busy during this period, so it was a nice, comfortable atmosphere. Good selection of fresh seafood, warm and cold items. Dessert range was also good with waffles, ice cream, cakes, biscuits, fruits, etc. Recommended to visit on a weekday afternoon if you prefer to be able to chat comfortably in a relatively quiet setting with a small group of people. Staff were quite attentive too.
4
Have a birthday dinner in Oscar's. I have a nice buffet with my hubby. Fresh oystar, mussel, lobster , salmon and tuna sashimi. Recommend laksa( with scallop & lobster). My favorite is the dessert. Waffle and cake and truffles is the best. The nicest thing is they give us a mini birthday cake :
5
I went there for dinner with my friends and we were so lucky that we got chance to look around the hotel. Hotel was stunning and decently packed with Christmas goodies and decorations. Guy from front deck , I m sorry I can't recall his name , he was very generous , professional and very helpful. Thank you for all your support!! Food was very delicious and it was buffet. Absolutely very gastronomic!! Thank you so much for all your great hospitality!!See you guys soon!!
5
You can have the buffet breakfast in a number of restaurants throughout the hotel. Oscars offers the best choice and is much more lively. Its on the ground floor next to the reception area. During your stay i would recommend you try Oscar's at least onc

Oscar's has been a frequent restaurant choice for business lunches for me for the past decade and longer. Whether it is for larger or smaller parties - or that confidential "one-on-one": the consistently high quality of food choices available and the great service delivered by Oscar's staff has kept me coming back time and time again. The lunch buffet spread is well balanced between Western and Asian dishes on offer - with exemplary good daily soups and salads as well as a great desserts section available for patrons. The noodle bar on the terrace serves made to order fresh local fare and is truly an excellent choice to savour typical Singaporean dishes (like "Laksa").The Oscar's service staff is very friendly and highly professional. Also, I personally do like the open concept dining room design - with a timeless yet classy decor scheme applied throughout.In my experience, Oscar's delivers consistent high quality with their lunch buffet offering, and has done so over a considerable length of time. To me this is no small feat to accomplish in the highly competitive luxury hotel restaurant scene in Singapore. Thus, I can recommend Oscar's - and especially for a business lunch. I will certainly be back, and am very much looking forward to it

Arrived here after a long intercontinental flight and missed meals. Great place to refuel with a wide selection of salads, Asian and European dishes.Staff are very attentive and friendly.Saw a small company party there and it seemed an ideal place for such entertainment.Well worth a visit but be disciplined for the temptation is to overeat given the attractive food layout and the delicious food itsel
5
Second time at Oscar's for brunch on the 24 th of December 2016.As expected , excellent service and the food was amazing. Fresh oysters , crabs , lobsters , the works.Salads were fresh and creative. Hot buffet line had a good choice, not too big but delicious choices.Attentive chefs looking on all the time, making sure food was not running out.Service staff attentive. The trip was worth every cent. The prices are reasonable starting at approx. $95++ with free flow of soft drinks.Alcohol options also available.Looking forward to another visit soon
5
Excellent selection of fresh seafood, cooked meats, Asian dishes, cold cuts and amazing selection of sweet dishes at the end. Added extras were the gin station and N2 icecreams
3
Have visited other hotels for their buffets before. For the price paid, the variety was too little. Taste of food was ok. Laksa was average. You can get better laksa at any hawker centre.
3
Tried the dinner buffet which is not worth the money paid. Cooked food selection that I tried was bad-they probably used frozen crabs for Chilli crab because the crab meat was tasteless, oyster sauce prawn was overcooked or not fresh cause the prawns were quite mushy, duck was too dry, roasted lamb was too raw in the middle, honey baked ham skin too tough and dry. Only enjoyed the oysters, ice cream, salad, bread and cheese (only 3 types) and cakes. Almost missed the noodles bar which was placed outside the restaurant that served food beef brisket noodles (easily available) from Food courts
5
Oscars for breakfast is a great way to begin a day. The selection is superb and the quality/flavor is wonderful. Couple all that with great service bringing coffee and orange juice and your day has to be a good one. Expensive, but where in Singapore isn't
5
We stayed at the Conrad and spontaneously decided to have dinner at the Oscars. We enjoyed the all inclusive buffet and did not regret it. It was worth the money. Local and continental dishes are freshly prepared and nicely presented. Staff is highly attentive and helpful
2
Just visited Oscar's to try their festive buffet. Priced at $86++, the food quality and range do not match up with many other buffets in similar price range. Only two choices of sashimi ( salmon and tuna) plus crayfish, mussels, shellfish, oysters and prawns made up your seafood section. Ribeye for roast, honey bake ham and the rest of the hot food are what you find at neighbourhood food stalls. There is a noodle station serving laksa which is not bad but seriously, you don't visit such places and pay these prices to eat hawker food. Dessert offerings are probably the only section that deserve their place in this restaurant. Wouldn't go back and recommend to stay clear. Many better options elsewhere in Singapore
3
My husband and two children (aged 10 and 7 years) attended the Christmas Brunch. While the staff were excellent and food varied and plentiful we were quite disappointed with the food quality. The lobster and prawns were flavourless and roast pork was fatty and contained lots of bones. Dessert was however brilliant with our children enjoying the chocolate fountain in particular. Overall for the price paid I expected better quality
3
It is strange when you have a Christmas eve buffet diner incl. champagne & red and white wine that there is only a cheap chardonnay and no sauvignon blanc. We payed 500S$ + for 2 pax. The food was ok. The Christmas atmosphere was not very present. lookt a normal buffet diner with some decoration. Next year no Oscars for us
5
My wife and I went to Oscars for the Sunday Seafood Brunch as I had been there before around 10 years before and had really enjoyed. The brunch and available drinks packages present outstanding value with a magnificent array of seafood from around the world and cooked dishes and salads etc. Not being a desert fans we are sure that we could not eat another bite of seafood at the end of the brunch. They also had rib fillet, suckling pig and London duck, but he pig was a little disappointing without the skin being crisp and crackling. Would do it again next time we are in Singapore
5
My husband and I enjoyed the Christmas Day brunch very much, and stayed the full 3 hours. We were greeted and seated nicely, table decorations were lovely with res napkins folded like a Christmas Tree, a real mini pine tree placed on each table, green water classes and placemats to match the theme. The range of food was great, perhaps it is standard for a 5-star hotel. For the cold foods, they had a caesar salad station with a large parmesan wheel, cold cuts, sashimi/sushi, seafood on ice (boston lobster, oysters, shrimp, scallops), soup (consomme, cream of tomato), mini dishes of pan fried foie gras and pan fried cod, cheese station (smoked cheese, brie, and a few other soft cheeses), few additional marinated salads, etc. For the hot foods, they had a range of Asian dishes such as lamb rogan josh, butter chicken masala, cereal prawns, etc. They had an array of western dishes as well. The selection of meats were quite vast: beef, salt crusted snapper, duck (too fatty), suckling pig, honey/pineapple cured ham, turkey, etc. Finally, the dessert was extensive. Three kinds of log cakes, pecan pie, sticky date pudding, tarts, chocolates, biscuits, macaroons (although they ran out quite soon), ice cream, etc. The only criticism we had was that firstly, they did not replenish the cheese station so when we returned at the end, the station was sloppy and had to ask three different waiters if they were going to refill the station. Secondly, I saw the dessert area was getting sloppy also, which I thought was not acceptable for 5-star standard. Lastly, the house wine was not of great quality. For what we pay for, we expected more. Overall, we had a great Christmas day meal
5
festive Christmas dinner; great ambience and atmosphere in the heart of the city area yet nestled in a somewhat more hidden away area near Suntec :)
4
Service was OK, food variety was great for the buffet and food quality was very good. My SO and I had a mix of American, Indian, Asian and Japanese food each morning.
4
Went for the festive lunch and the spread is very good and fresh. Oysters may not be big but is very fresh. Staff is very attentive and friendly too! 15% discount if u have Citibank or anz credit cards!
2
Service is decent. Had food poisoning after the buffet. I didn't eat the raw food. I ate cheese, chocolate and mainly the cooked food. Suspected the cheese and chocolate. The spread of food is so-so though.
5
Attentive staff and fresh seafood. Brought my friend to Oscar's for her birthday celebration... and we were pleasantly surprised with a birthday cake n song frm the staff along with a tambourine. Thank you for creating a memorable experience for us.
4
Food range available at Oscar's is quite nicely covered. You have a bit of everything - Do-it-yourself Cesar salad bar, cold cuts, cheese, seafood, soup, festive delights (turkey and ham), hot dishes from Chinese to Indian, a noodles station serving local noodle dishes outside on the terrace area, not to mention the array of desserts, waffles and cakes.It might seem a lot, but for average eaters, the range is actually not overwhelming at all. Unlike some buffets where you can never finish tasting all even if you only took a small bite of each, Oscar's will enable you to sample a bit of everything before you indulge yourself in your favourites.For my family and I, it was the London Duck Roll. The tender duck meat slice was nicely accompanied with a thin silver of crispy skin, which added on aroma and texture to the roll, as well as the sweet mango sauce which adds an additional layer of flavour to the original savoury dish. My family and I kept on going back for more!Just a tiny flea in the ointment - Tea (and coffee) are served complimentary with the buffet at customer's request. Requested for English Breakfast, which arrived promptly, but tea cup was missing. First requested for a tea cup from the waitress attending to my table but after a round at the buffet, no cup. Subsequently requested again to a manager (wearing a suit, presumably management-class), after a few more rounds at the buffet still no tea cup. Only on the third try to another waiter did my cup arrive.It's really unfortunate, but as an avid tea drinker, I really hate to leave my tea bag steeping in hot water for too long or have my tea cold
3
We ate here for three breakfasts. The restaurant was very busy on two of the mornings so was crowded and the noise level quite high. There was a long queue to enter the restaurant on one morning. Buffet options were wide ranging although fairly standard fare. Fresh fruit was generally not of high quality (some bruised or overripe).The noise levels and overcrowding were not as expected from the standard of a five star hotel
4
I had a generously late checkout at the Conrad Hotel but still had 3 hours till my flight back to Europe. I knew from a year ago that the buffet at Oscars is top class quality but the restaurant can be crowded and a bit noisy. So I asked for a quiet table to have a some a la carte food and was immediately invited to go to the bar across the lobby to enjoy my steak there. The steak and the service were top class and I enjoyed at least part of my waiting time till my flight
4
The waiting staff were friendly, courteous, helpful and polite. I booked a table of 16 people for a Xmas brunch and we sat till way past the end and the staff did not mind. We never had to ask for our champagne glasses to be topped up as they were always generously filled (unlike Mezza9). The choice of food for the mains ranged from local to western palettes and the desserts were an assortment of freshly made crepe (really nice) to chocolates and cakes. The cocktails were amazing! For the price it's great value for money considering the service and food. Nice touch with the Xmas decor. I would only like to mention a few pointers to improve this establishment even further would be the reservation customer line was not handled professionally (e.g. poor communication), the roasted potatoes for the turkey was dry (almost like eating wood) and could you serve macaroons at the dessert bar?
4
I had my breakfast at Oscars while staying for 7 nights at the Conrad. I usually reached the restaurant around 8.30 a.m. and it was quite busy. Several days I had to join a queue, however it moved quickly and I never had to wait more than a couple of minutes.I found the variety and quality of food to be good and empty serving dishes were replenished quickly. Used plates were always quickly cleared off my table.Special mention must be made of the staff. Although they were always very busy, they were unfailingly polite and able to give service with a smile. Fernando Diaz, the Assistant Manager, appeared to treat each guest as if they were the most important person in the restaurant and he made sure I was well looked after.Ice cream for breakfast was a nice luxury too
5
Was celebrating both my brother and my graduation over at Oscar. The food is splendid and the atmosphere was great as well.
4
Firstly, every single staff member was a delight. So helpful and friendly.
The food was oddly disjointed. They have roast beef but no vegetables nor roast potatoes (and therefore no Yorkshire pudding).
4
The staff are friendly. They even sang birthday song for my mum when they served the birthday cake to her.
4
We had our breakfast here when were we staying at Conrad. The staff was very friendly, the restaurant had great lighting, and did you feel crowded even when it was very busy.Food was delicious with a wide variety of options to select from. Fruit options were quite limited though, which was a let down for me, as I looked forward to enjoying some tropical fruits, there were the usual apple, melon, watermelon, and the rest were pretty much canned fruits
2
The buffet used to be really good in the past. Over the years, I have noted a steady decline in quality and flavour. My last visit was quite a disappointment.The oysters in the seafood bar were disappointing at my last visit. It was probably the only saving grace when I had the buffet a year ago, where the oysters were really plump and tasty. Now, I see the staff pull out pre-shuckled oysters from a container of ice. This resulted in oysters that didn't taste of anything anymore, as the icy slush would have rinsed off the flavours.The boiled crayfish from the seafood bar smelled and tasted bad too.The variety of different food is commendable, but everything feels disjointed and not very likeable. Honestly, I would rather have fewer item choices but well cooked and presented, rather than a wide variety, but all looking and tasting almost like leftovers. I thought the most embarrassing item was the fish in superior sauce, which looked and tasted like it was cooked the night before.The noodle bar is located outside, which in my opinion was probably the only thing worth mentioning now. Due to its obscure location, its a shame that some diners might skip it altogether. The prawn noodle broth was actually fragrant and legit-tasting. They also have laksa (meh) and wanton noodles (noodle texture excellent).Overall, I don't think I will be having the buffet dinner at Oscars anytime soon, till a substantial review into the quality and choices is made
4
We had both breakfast and dinner at Oscars - the service level is very good and the coffee is simply marvelous. There is a choice of either a la cart or buffet selections and we did both for dinner and breakfast respectively. Excellent selections of chinese and western menu items to cater to every taste
3
Sunday brunch with the family..booked outdoor seating but works in progress...Managed to get a table inside- nice decor, magnificient buffet, great choice, helpful staffBut: Oysters , great choice, but all taste the same. They are "washed" with ice water, no taste left. Same with lobster and crab, what a pity. Sushi and sushimi very tasty, as was th salmon. Beef, porc, soso, on the dry side. Nice service, formula with sparkling wine fine, desserts realy good, lot s of choice. Somme quality is missing, however for Singapore you.ll find something to your taste on this fabulous buffet
5
You would be very hard to please if you could not find something that you liked to eat at this restaurant. The food was cooked fresh in front of us each morning and the Chefs were more than happy to make specific dishes up if requested. The choices were amazing and enough to suit everyone from all walks of life.The staff in the restaurant were very attentive and quickly cleared away dirty dishes to allow you to choose your next fresh plate. I loved the steamed fish each morning and the choice of fresh cheeses. To even have an option of ice cream for breakfast was a lovely touch!I would highly recommend eating at this restaurant.
3
Oscars the food is rather good and nice but for the kind of buffet dinner price we paid i felt the variety of food is not enough and after fro two rounds and taking a a very fine portion of the food i have almost tasted everything. Henceforth i am only giving Average as my ratings
4
Had a great dinner with my wife at Oscars. The food was fresh and nice, the ambience was cosy and quiet for good conversation for couples. The service was also very attentive and the waiter who served us, Amin, always carried a smile on his face!
5
Whilst the standard of the food served in this establishment had dropped slightly over the years, it still is a wonderful experience dining in Oscars. The service staff is always keen to detail and makes the dining experience more enjoyable.
5
Delicious and tantalizing Mediterranean cuisine . Delectable chocolates and desserts. Friendly waitresses and waiters. Friendly chefs ever so eager to teach you new and simple recipes
4
The service was attentive and constantly being served with a smile. Thumbs up! definitely worth for a return!
Provided wide range of food selection, it was incredibly spoilt for choice.
5
we eat here for breakfast and the quality is fab. you can choose Asian and western food. there is also an egg station to make eggs of your choice. the service is very professional and friendly. could not ask for any more
5
its seems most people flock to the likes of teh Hyatt and Fullerton Sunday brunches (and they are very good), however when it comes it value for money then you cannot go past Oscars at the Conrad. It is amazing value for money with a fantastic spread and if you take the sparkling wine, red & white wine package then you cannot go wrong. Family friendly, full offering and wonderful service. I cannot wait to go back. Do yourself a favour and try it out at least once
4
A very family environment for Sunday brunch. Choice of non-alcohol, wine or with champagne. Boston lobster, oysters, sashimi & salad and other appetizers were generous & fresh. Desert spread was extensive but some need improvement.We had panne in tomato sauce. Can give that a miss. Not up to standard. Service is good. Staff are attentive and helpful. Cheerful and accommodating. Overall still have my recommendation if u are not looking for a Romantic exclusive environment.
5
We had guests in town last Sunday with a mix of tastes & preferences, so we were looking for a brunch that everyone could get excited about. After asking some other SC Members, we decided to head to Oscar’s at the Conrad Centennial. We have done plenty of brunches and sometimes quantity unfortunately does not equal quality, but at a reasonable 98++ (and a basic top-up option of 20++ for sparkling, wines, & , or 50++ with champagne), this buffet definitely packed in the good stuff… Super fresh seafood, carving stations and live cooking stations… It was a totally indulgent international spread, along with a sumptuous salad bar for the health conscious among the group. I decided to start at the seafood bar and took three different types of freshly oysters (a waiter informed me that they came all the way from France, Ireland and even Canada...)! We also made short work of the Boston Lobsters, London Duck, snow crab legs, foie gras and our visitors enjoyed a local touch at the special noodle bar. We also tried various live stations, and at one of them a friendly chef prepared a scrumptious risotto on the spot! Some of us had taken the free-flow top up, and with the regular re-pouring of the Laurent Perrier Champagne and wines, we left in excellent spirits and totally satisfied! Unfortunately we got too full and missed out on some dishes, like the Vietnamese specialties and the spread of gourmet cheeses… next time
5
The breakfast is fantastic and the staff are very friendly and helpful. Nothing is a problem. We have been three mornings in a row, and when we sat down this morning, they automatically brought out the tea and coffee we had been ordering previously without even asking
5
This is not only value for money, it is also very good quality variation on food and taste. We are very picky and we have been back 3 times, we love the Conrad and to be honest I usually hate a buffet! Everything from a good selection of Oysters and condiments to go with them to at least 4 various smoked salmons, sushi, foie gras pan seared with vanilla salt and apple and passion fruit, and so much more, my mouth waters. You need to go to the website and see all the photo’s that will get you to book immediately as it is pretty difficult to get in. Oh you obviously can choose the free flow Champaign
4
We had dinner with some friends and decided for the buffet. The choices are very difficult as there's too many good things to chose from. The staff are extremely friendly and answer any question with a smile. The noodles corner is outside - don't miss the Laksa (I hope is spelled it right) the desserts were excellent and we had no choice but to sample them all.We accompanied dinner with an excellent Australian Cabernet 
5
Many asian styled dishes and some nice western styled dishes. Has fresh oysters, crayfish, salmon, tuna. Lots of dessert!!!! Dessert was awesome one of the best selection in buffet. Citibank cards 15% off.
5
High class restaurant with excellent service crew. Food was fresh and delicious. Indeed a sumptious spread of buffet.
5
Celebrated a friend birthday with lunch & commented in reservation. At the end of lunch, Oscar presented a whole complimentary birthday cake...
4
I was there for buffet lunch and the food was good. Seafood was fresh as well as the sashimi. However, we were initially offered outdoor seats as indoor seats were fully booked. Will recommend others to specify indoor seatings during reservations if needed.
4
Good food. Could help with more service staff, but they just managed to cope. Suggest coffee station to be self service.
4
Limited seafood and Japanese food and no soup, though price is only $3/adult cheaper than the line but The Line has much more variety and more details of each station.
3
Breakfast was always too busy so went to other restaurants in the hotel. Lunch again was very busy. The food is good but expensive and with added taxes.
3
Horrible buffet spread ! Food are tasteless and limited spread. Steamed fish has no taste ( not even soya sauce or sesame oil) . The noodle counter is hidden outside which no one knows. Plates are not cleared and have to inform the servers to do so. Won't return for the amount I have to pay
5
We took the brunch with champaign option and wow the food and the drink were amazing, as was the atmosphere.3 hours of pure heaven for any food or champaign lover. From great fresh seafood, suckling pig, spare rib beef joint, London duck to cheese board, oscars has it all.Pace yourself, remember it is a 3 hour marathon rather than a sprint.Nothing is too much for the staff at oscars and Neil, Jenny , Amin and the team do a fantastic job meeting your culinary needs.
5
I had a pleasant dining experience at Oscar's. My guests and I ate for 2 hours straight and we were very full. Quality of food is good and the usual variety for an International Buffet. There was a credit card promotion, so it was pretty good. Being able to make reservations online was good too.
4
Spent our 1st wedding anniversary there. Food and service was good. Atmosphere was alright too. Pricing abit high
3
I had a simple wrap and fries $23++
So very expensive for what it is. Stayed at this lovely hotel. Always too busy in this restaurant for breakfast. Lovely outdoor area.
1
The seafood was not fresh, the spread was disappointing. The presentation of the food was unappealing. The only thing that impressed my party was the foie gras dish. Even the ambience was not worth the money we spent on the meal. I would not dine at Oscar's again
4
One of the signature restaurants at Conrad Centennial, Oscar's has had a long standing reputation with buffets. The restaurant prides itself in the cold-cooked seafood selection with fresh oysters that are shucked right in front of you - which serves to also inform guests that the oysters are fresh!Oscar's has a delectable selection of food choices, local cuisine included i.e. Satay (Chicken/Mutton), Teh Tarik (this is a must try!), to name a few. There is also a cheese counter for those who particularly love cheese. I noted that they restaurant served 2 kinds of soup - one being the typical Western-flavoured soup, and the other a Chinese-flavoured soup. While I'm not particularly fond of Chinese soup, I take it in good faith that the restaurant serves to cater to all walks of life to which some would very much prefer a Chinese-flavoured soup. They also have a good selection of bread to pair with the soup, which can also be purchased from the in-house bakery. I particularly love the ice-cream selection the restaurant has. Pity that most of the dessert trays were empty by the time I got to them, and this was 30 minutes before the end of the buffet - pretty disappointing I must say. The restaurant is child friendly so be sure to inform them in advance. We did so and the hotel prepared a set of child-friendly cutlery. Some other points to note:- The "teh tarik" (an Indian/Malay version of milk tea) is a must-try! Creamy in texture, with the right amount of sweetness. - Attentive hotel staff. One staff gave my son a fruit to explore with, and the other who was in charge of the "teh tarik" counter has a great memory with the number of order you placed and where you're seated. Quite awesome a chap I must say.Special thanks to the following hotel staff:Benjamin Tan, Fernando, Kanoko, Amin & team (the "teh tarik" guys)This experience would have notched a full 5-stars for the lack of desserts
5
1. Reservation was politely confirmed2. Ushering to our table was prompt3. There was outline brief of the buffet4. Beverage service was prompt5. Quality and value of the buffet was excellent.6. Dishes were topped up promptly7. The fresh un-shucked oysters was a very good idea.8. The family enjoyed ourselve
5
Was invited to a business dinner networking session at Oscars on Monday.I have not been to Oscars for nearly 5 months.For the month of August they had the Peranakan dishes added on TOP on their usual international buffet. As usual the standard of food were always perfect .I enjoyed the Kueh Pie Tee and the prawn noddles not forgetting the Dry Laksa pastaWhich was created exclusively for Oscars by food blogger Miss Tam Chiak.I loved the spicy Udang Masak Assam and there was a live Teh Tarik station . Try the Nonya desserts tooI could not resist the Black-forest cake . You must try them..it's worth it.Thanks Oscars for always providing good services and perfect food. 
5
We had a wonderful dining experience at Oscar's Cafe and Terrace. There was a fabulous spread of food and service was impeccable. Our plates were cleared almost as soon as we finished the last morsel of food. Drinks were refilled quickly. Staff were generally very observant and attentive
3
There were no juice or hot drinks dispensers so you need to get the assistance of the wait staff if you want to get juice or to refill your coffee and tea. A few of the stations for the buffet like the ice cream and noodles sections were constantly unmanned so it's almost impossible to get your noodles or ice cream. The pan cakes and waffles were cold
5
One of the best super bunch on Sunday. Service is great, food is great. the meat section.. R oast Suckling Pig, Duck, and Roast beef was excellent, crispy on the skins, juicy on the meat. 4 type of oyster to choose, on the spot to prepare, hence clean and fresh.
4
I treated myself to one nice dinner while recently in Singapore. Generally I try not to dine on property, but timing and other constraints led me to opt for Oscar's. My dinner was good and the server and wait staff worked very hard to ensure that my experience was exceptional
4
The Oscar's has one of the best range of breakfast offerings in Singapore. However, it can get really busy. Be prepared to queue up to get in and also at the eggs station. The staff are generally helpful and approachable.
5
Everything was excellent. Staff are very helpful & friendly. Food was nice too. Enjoy the dining experience. Thumbs up👍
5
Going back to this place for late night dinners & meetings was never been a problem. Staffs are very professional & accommodating. Never had an issue.
2
Price is not worth it for the available food. Suggestion: add more options as food served are cooked / taste the same. Seafood option also too less.
5
Was here with friends for the fresh oyster seafoods dinner. We were happy with the oysters and the spread of other foods. Sashimi, prawn was good enough too. Tried the cheese n wine and we were all happy with them. Dry laksa, satay are few others that you should try them out. An awesome night indeed
4
Pleasant experience. Good quality food. Especially enjoyed:1. the beef medallion which is very tender and well cooked2. cold seafood specifically the prawns which are fresh and the sashimi3. freshly made the tarik4. wide range of dessertWent during lunchtime so it was also appropriate for a business conversation as it was not too crowde
1
I had my breakfast after work because ifs nearby to my place we waited til 6am.When I had my waffle its cold, I try to ask the staff cooking at the pancake and waffle station if I can have a new one coz the waffle i took was cold,The staff refuse and told me its "like that" because its airy so its get cold easily. Thats the fact,thats why I want to change. I dont want to argue coz I am very tired.I just ate the porridge instead. The indian waiter is the only reason why I gave one star, he keep refilling water and juice on our table and suggest to us its more more itif we order a buffet instead of ala carte.Thank
4
Been here on multiple occasions for breakfast and have always been satisfied with the buffet. Large spread of items. I think they get a lot of customers with Chinese palates as there were lots of Chinese food items. Lot of items for everyone.....Service was the really impressive. The staff were very attentive and removed our dishes as soon as we were done
5
I eat here every time I stay at the Conrad but this time the food was the best it has ever been. The seafood curry laksa was to die for and the massive selection of foods at the buffet was impressive. I could not fault a thing. Plenty of seafood and Asian cuisine followed by yummy desserts. We will def be back
5
The spread offered at the Sunday Brunch was amazing! There's a good lot of fresh seafood (think oysters, sashimi, shell fishes), then slabs of quality beef, and super delicious Roast Duck. Just like how it's done in London! So much to eat after you finish the meats (the above mentioned was just a sampling!) The health bar was fantastic too! A little out of place considering all the food offered, but it does appease the guilty pleasure we had of devouring all the great food
4
I have eaten here many times over the last 4 years. The food is good. Lots of choice is available and the service is quick. Mornings are bustling with lots of guests. So may not be your choice if you don't like crowds.
2
Given the price paid, the food selection was too little, it will be good if they have more varieties.
3
Service and decoration is really good as in the five star hotel. The food are not as many as other international buffet restaurant. The price is really expensive.
4
This buffet has something for almost anyone! Egg station, dim sum, local Singapore noodles and rice, fresh fruit and yogurts, breads and cheeses, cereal, waffles and pancakes, and for desert ice cream.The fresh orange juice is excellent and the coffee choices are all good.Would have given it 5 stars but no berries of any kind
3
The food were served warm and good with a good selection of varieties. However, some service staff (only a handful) were observed to be rather impatient when managing requests from customers. I have seen the waiter showing annoyed and frustrated expression to an old lady asking for items repeatedly. Another staff at the laksa station has completely no eye contact with customer and simply waved his hand to the sign on the table when customers asked him for the type of food he was serving. He replied in a rather vexed tone that he doesn't serve soup noodle when someone requested for it.
5
The food at Oscar may not be the best or cheapest in town but the outstanding service of the staff more than made up for it. We visited the restaurant on 9 Jul 2016. The staff gave us a completely satisfactory F&B experience from the moment we sat down till we left the restaurant. Edmund was simply amazing! He was very attentive and thoughtful. Without us asking, he served my wife warm water with lemon and honey when he noticed her coughing. When he found out that we were having our wedding anniversary celebration, he arranged for drinks and a cake on the house. We were pleasantly surprised and thankful. The rest of the restaurant was also very attentive and courteous. We enjoyed our dinner and thank you for making our evening even more memorable
5
We were staying at the Conrad Centennial and as diamond members got to choose between this restaurant and the Executive Lounge for breakfast-- we originally said we would do Oscars one morning and the lounge the next, but after our first morning we decided we'd just stick with Oscars!! There is a huge choice of breakfast items, but Asian and Western and we were happy to see so many fresh fruit choices. It also looked like there was a juicing station in the back corner. One morning there was a huge chunk of a honeycomb filled with honey. I've never seen that at breakfast before, but it sure was delicious!
5
This place is such a business-driven hotel that I felt underdressed eating here, eventhough I was in a collared t-shirt and slacks when a large majority were in suits. Nevertheless, I was made to feel very welcomed and had great service and food. Staff were very warm and attentive. Definitely a winner
5
We loved Fernando Diaz!! He was the best host ever! He remembered our names and what juices we liked and would have them delivered to our table while we got our smorgasbord breakfast every morning. Fernando has the very best customer service skills and was so kind and friendly, it was a joy to go to breakfast and be greeted by him each day! The Conrad is very lucky to have such a great customer relations employee!

A friend wanted a good dinner buffet with solid desserts for her birthday treat. I remembered Oscars had a fairly fabulous one and thus made booking for 3 persons.At $83++ (from $50 odd last year), I thought there should be some amazing enhancements to the variety or quality.I was deeply disappointed. It has evolved to a greatly asian buffet. Wows:- The 2 selection of oysters - delicious. But out of the 1 dozen I had, 2 were bad.- The Roast beef - I had that too late, so it was very cooked under the heating lamp. Not their fault, still tasty- Movenpick Ice creamthats all actually.Now the not so good:- The had decided to place sashimi precut and on buffet. Previously it was cut to what you want. So it was super fresh previously, now its just stingyly small pieces served so some shredded carrot, which simply do not make sense cos the carrot shreds change the taste of the sashimi. Try raddish if you really must continue serving this way.- The oysters were placed whole on ice. The logic is that you are supposed to "order" from the staff behind the counter, who is busy shuckling them. So the whole oysters on ice is actually for show only. Some guests took them not knowing that. This procedure created many problems, as many just gave empty plates and placed order of 2-3 dozens at one go. It was a mad rush, frantic time for the cooks, they dropped the pans twice during dinner as the work space behind the ice counter is simply too small for them to perform efficiently. And the restaurant was only 1/3 full. Imagine the craziness when the restaurant is full.- The noodle bar is quite sad. the ingredients not fresh and the meat (pork) really smells really bad.- Dessert - the waffle mix is wrong and mine was undercooked and it was all dough that I am eating.Apart of these, the service was really attentive. The waiting staff remembered that amongst us, one drank coke and another coke light and did not mix us up during the top ups. Oh, you have to pay for drinks, sodas at $6++ per person freeflow and they use pet bottles of them to top up. I came across a cook name Ken, and he was really cheerful and helpful, he offered to do the caesar salad when he didnt need to.Ok, final verdict... The price is really not worth the spread. I attribute a certain percentage of this verdict to my taste preference cos I dont like the soups (tomato or chicken soup), I dont like anything with tomato so the curries, marinara, arrabiata all didnt work for me..

Wide spread of options from Asian (local / Japan / Indian) to international options. The egg station is very popular but the orders are cleared fast. One of the best breakfast options available at a hotel.
5
Yum. An incredible range of food and service to match. Buffet prices are high but if you are hungry and like variety, it is well worth it. 7 Ice cream flavours for breakfast - bring it on!
4
"Old reliable" Conrad food that won't disappoint if too lazy to leave the hotel to get some eats. In a famous foodie place like Singapore, its still best to visit the hawkers.
5
Issac Lee is very attentive, always on the go for providing information about consumer needs.. I would be back for due to the almost am
4
The oysters and pastries taste marvellous, though seafood lacks variety and hot dishes needs improvement. Ambience is cozy and service staff are very attentive to customers.
2
For close to $100 per person there is only a small section of local dishes, a row of salads and a row of fruits only. Even the noodle station has to be outside the restaurant due to limited space. Soft drinks are chargeable too.
5
Really had great buffet. I'm pleased with your chope for booking fast. I would use this app to book and eat at that brunch buffet again.
5
We decided to have our last meal in our hotel restaurant Oscars before leaving Singapore. We chose to have the ala carte menu over the buffet and were not disappointed. The food was excellent. The service was very good also, with a very knowledgeable waiter taking care of us for the evening. Only downside for us was the cost of a bottle of wine, very expensive, this is typical of everywhere in Singapore however
5
Excellent place to have a relaxing Sunday brunch. The quality of food is only surpassed by the exceptional service. One will be spoiled for choice of fresh lobster and oysters, prime rib, fois gras, roast duck, suckling pig, premium sashimi and mouthwatering desserts. All these while sipping unlimited champagne and various wines. It will leave you recharged for the week ahead.
4
We recently stayed at the Conrad and went to the restaurant for breakfast. Next to the traditional big hotel breakfast offerings, there were plenty of asian options (fried rice, dim sum, dal, ...). The best part was the sweet station where they prepared Brussels waffles with toppings and had an ice cream cart. It was like a dream come true ;-
5
Great service. Great food selection, even though it was Saturday lunch. Booking through chope was convenient
5
Pre stay we emailed the hotel regarding gluten free diet and it was no problem. Gluten free bread at meals Fernando Diaz, Edmund Netto, the hotel staff all proving fantastic service.
We eat in the restaurant, The food selection quality and service excellent. Great dining.
4
Went for the Sunday Brunch Buffet to celebrate my 7th Anniversary. The kind gestures from the service crew made my day more pleasant. :)
5
We were there for our 11th wedding anniversary. The staff were attentive to our needs and kept looking out for our kid. They made us feel extra special even though they did not know we were there for a celebration
4
Probably the best oyster selection in Singapore. The service was outstanding, extremely friendly and helpful
3
Tried the buffet here with friends and we were disappointed with the spread. There were sashimi but no sushi! If you love fresh seafood, the oysters are very fresh and staff will only open them when you wanna try them.
4
Let me say, I'm very blessed to have tasted excellent French food. It was with great expectations that I brought my wife to visit David Laval's Voilah! French Festival offerings, but boy, was I disappointed.The appetisers were decent bite-sized offerings, enough to get the mood started for the mains. Four types of cheeses from a French-themed buffet could've been improved upon, though.For the mains, the gratin was decent, but the ratatouille could've been roasted longer. Beef bourguignon was just...not spiced, and not marinated enough. And where on earth was the coq au vin listed in the promotional materials? The saving grace for the mains were actually the seafood section, where the prawns, scallop, mussels and oysters were really top-of-the-line fresh. However, the having to wait for 5 minutes while the chef does the shucking does take a little bit out of the experience.Desserts were only so-so when compared with other hotels of similar star ratings and status in town. While more than passable, they don't scream wow
5
Thank you to the staff for arranging a nice Birthday song sung for my Hubby, which finished our brunch with a delightful experience. We loved the food selection there, and the service staff are attentive to us despite the crowd yesterday. Ambience can be improved, as I feel that the N2 ice cream station seemed oddly placed at a side of the restaurant.
5
We visited Oscar's just after the new Sunday Brunch menu was introduced and had a dining experience that was really quite sensational. The choice of dishes, the presentation and quality of the ingredients was of the highest quality with great staff looking after your every need.The seafood bar was excellent with, as I recall, a choice of four varieties of oysters from around the world and the beef was just so succulent. Pastries and deserts were beautifully presented in a most artistic way while my wife was very impressed with the Japanese offerings.We have been to many buffets around the world and to us, taking into account the high cost structures of Singapore and the AU$ exchange rate, while not as large as some others in area, this was at the top of the list in terms of value, choice and quality

1. Was looking forward to an oysters "feast" but they were a little disappointing. Despite being fresh, they could be "meatier". As a result, it was a bit challenging just trying to dig out the oyster with the given fork. 2. Limiting to just sashimi and smoked salmon may not go too well with Jap food lovers too. Adding a selection of sushi and tempura stuff will be great. 3. Lack of variety at the live stations. Mainly soup based. Some BBQ seafood could be added
3
I tried the buffet dinner. The variety of food is good but not as extensive as some other hotels. Quality of food is acceptable. Service is satisfactory too.
4
Lovely ambience in the restaurant. The staff were very responsive and courteous. And my sandwich was delicious!
5
Had the buffet dinner at Oscars 4 years ago. The service And food not only remained good, Oscar's service and food got even better! Not overly crowded and great outdoor seating.
5
Lovely ambience, awesome food and excellent service staff.
Value for money
What a great combination!
5
nice to find a place to eat for supper. was looking at the restaurants outside but they were closed. had good food (pad thai) and ice cream (movenpick) late night
4
We did have an Oscar burger and a Indian curry, both dishes were very well prepared and a lot of food, we could eat more that day :-)
5
Fantastic selection of American and Asian cuisine. My family enjoyed dining here every morning. I loved the waffles with gelato, with different flavors offered every day.
5
Best Sunday Buffet Brunch I've had. Loved the foie gras. Loved the selection of freshly shucked oysters. Loved the Boston lobsters. Loved the U.S. Prime Rib. Loved the Suckling Pig. Loved the London roast duck. Loved the shrimps. Loved the scallops. Loved the sashimi. Loved the Crepe Suzette, both with Grand Marnier and with Cointreau. The "Organic Pasta" station was average. Oscar's signature Black Forest cake was chocolaty with few to no cherries in each slice. The service was excellent - plates were cleared quickly & the staff was attentive & went out of their way to ensure the best culinary experience
4
Food is fresh and ingredients are of a good quality, with a nice variety to suit every palate. However, we felt several stations served up rather bland tasting meats - the roast beef and the London duck in particular. We really enjoyed the suckling pig, the oysters and the soups, and the desserts were lovely. Service was attentive and up to par. With the burgeoning cost of Sunday brunches, the Oscar brunch is a good price point
4
Pleasantly surprised with the spread and cooking styles in Oscars. The seafood spread was very good for a lunch buffet, surpassing my expectations. The hot dishes were cooked using modern methods which is refreshing. Taste is subjective and I feel the seasoning can be a little heavier to bring out the taste of the dishes. Overall, no complaints of this buffet. Enjoyed it and will be back
5
We had breakfast included in our room rate when we visited and the variety of food offered was amazing! so delicious!
4
I had memories of the wonderful food and service of this place. Sadly I found declined in both aspects. It went from fantastic to good.
4
Everything you could wish for in a multicultural breakfast buffet! Fresh fruit, and fare from Europe, Asia, India, as well as American delights.
I highly recommend this breakfast. Their offerings were far too many to list!
They even had a dessert bar!
5
Restaurant food was good but could do better with more variety. Noodles bar was outside and caused some inconvenience but it was still okay. Staff was friendly and polite, generally a positive experience at oscars!
5
A wonderful multi-ethnic breakfast buffet,truely exceptional selection and service. Love the Gellato at breakfast
5
Breakfast was a treat to start the day perfectly. There was so much choice and all of it really tasty and well presented. The only problem we had was we ate far too much!
5
I came here for the Sunday brunch buffet with a group of friends and we all thought that the food was generally of a very high standard.The variety of items on offer is just nice and not too overwhelming. I prefer buffets where they focus on a reasonable selection of good quality items rather than throw out everything on the table but at the expense of consistency or quality control. Note that the Sunday brunch buffet does not really focus on local foods (there is a counter outdoors serving a small variety of local dishes) but in Singapore the best places to sample these are in the heartlands or the older hawker centers.The lobster bisque and a good selection of breads, cheese and cold cuts offered a tantalizing start to the meal. In particular, I really enjoyed the freshly baked crusty rye and sourdough breads. It is not so easy to find good continental style breads in Singapore.Oysters (4 different types), lobsters, shellfish and sashimi was generally very fresh. I had the opportunity to try most of the cooked meat/fishes and the standards were high. The items which were on small plates such as the cod, wagyu beef, lamb etc were especially delectable. Desserts were great as well - I took to the fluffy waffles and the macha chocolate fondue.Service was excellent -responsive and friendly. It was easy to catch the servers' attention.Plates were cleared frequently but unobtrusively. In terms of value, the price of the Sunday brunch buffet is very reasonable for the quality of food and the level of service. The group can't wait to be back
5
We have been staying at Conrad hotel over the years and the breakfast at Oscars is what we look forward to during our stay. It offers top quality East and West selection of food, freshly squeezed juices and fresh exotic fruits. We can see the chef tries to keep the food varied every morning. At peak time between 0800 - 0900 it can get very busy but the staff run the place like a trooper and makes everything run smoothly. I have travelled all over the world, Oscars @ Conrad is definitely right up there with the best - Keep up the good work
5
Super hospitality, fresh buffet food and a true pleasurable experience.A wide variety of dishes from salads with all the trimmings, Cheeses, soup, sushi, Indian, beef dishes, crayfish, and all different types of seafood. There truly is something for everyone here. Also the waffles & ice cream usually a hit with my family. There are quite a lot of toppings and homemade gourmet chocolates. (wish they did a crumble or custard and or molten lava cakes....) but otherwise delicious
5
4 types of fresh oysters, from France US Australia and NZ! And the excellent Boston lobster as well as crab (: Glad we went at 6pm & were one of the earliest. One point to note though.. they didn't really refill the lobster and the crab through out.. we were there till 9pm and they only refilled once
5
Waiters and waitresses are very polite and patient. Comfortable and cosy surroundings. Oysters were fresh and overall food was above average.
5
Very good breakfast with continental breakfast, Japanese, Indians, a large variety of cheese and bread and pastries, fruits with ice-cream too! All kinds of juices! Simply the best!
5
First time visit Oscar. 1 for 1 buffet value for money. Nice place n good food. Not very crowded. Will go there again for sure.
1
The breakfast buffet is over-priced. I don't mind paying a lot of money for breakfast as it is expected in Singapore but at least offer more selection. Variety of hot food is really poor. Can just eat at the Suntec City
2
Not a good dining option. Might be OK to have a beer al fresco but the burger I had was tasteless. Perhaps the buffet is good, but I did not try that.
5
Delightful with a wide selection, although I must agree with another reviewer that inclusion of more local traditional Singapore-Malaysian food would be appreciated. After all, we visit Singapore to enjoy the local cuisine too.
5
We went to Oscars for the NYE buffet dinner. The food & champagne were good but the staff were excellent.
5
We've been here on several occasions and I have yet to be disappointed with the buffet spread, their level of service and how polite and professional the staff here are compared to other 6 star hotels nearby. I hope they keep this up as it is my favorite go-to place if I have to host a birthday or to celebrate a special occassio
4
This is my 2nd time here for Christmas international buffet after 5 years times. I always planned the dining matter for my company and this year I suggested back to Oscar because some of my colleagues never been there before.It’s never disappointed me!! Oscar café is one of my favorite international buffets in Singapore. They still maintain the food standard after so many years. All my colleagues and my boss said its delicacy and fresh. Good !
2
Small buffet spread 3-4 choices of cakes and bread. No fried mee hoon or Nasi Lemak. Only fishball Kuey tiao soup,no other noodles. Steamed Pau and soon kuey,no other dim sum. Porridge with condiments. Bacon,sausage,egg station. Chawan mushi,miso soup, selective sushi and maki. Waffle,icecream and cereal.The food wasn't replenished when it's finishing so have to wait awhile. Was told that the chawan mushi need 5minutes to steam but it's cold like taken out from the fridge when served.
5
We can pick and choose from a variety of cuisines and there is something for everyone on display. Food was delicious and the restaurant was well attended.
5
Attached to Conrads, we used this bar, cafe, restaurant area a few times, only saw one staff member and he was brilliant, I'm sorry I cant remember his name, but a great staff member, not the cheapest place, but then quality rarely is, highly reccommended
4
Great place to have breakfast. Large variety of food on offer. Also excellent fish porridge to satisfy hunger anytime of the day
4
The food was nice and the services is good even though the restaurant was fully packed. Varieties of seafood.
4
Oscars offers an extensive selection of international cuisine at the breakfast buffet. Starting with sashimi and various varieties of smoked salmon, the spread includes local delicacies and staple western breakfast items, along with cooked to order eggs.Service is very attentive and dishes are cleared promptly
5
Despite of having full house of diners, the service crew were at their best attending to diners requests. Emptied bowls and plates were cleared timely. There were a huge selection at the buffet line. Christmas Ham, Turkey, Oysters, Seafood, Sashimi, Roast Chicken, Laksa, Steam fish and Christmas desserts were a blast. The dish that wow me is Masala Crab. Spices from the masala compliment well with the freshness of the crab. Price is about S$170 for 2 pax. Will definitely visit again.
5
I recently had a lovely Christmas dinner at Oscars. The buffet spread is good and the highlight had to be the wide array of seafood, and the four varities of oysters served (2 varities from France, 1 from New Zealand, and 1 from US). When at Oscars, don't miss the cooked abalone -- most of my colleagues enjoyed there, and they were very quickly snapped up
4
I recently had breakfast here eight days in a row, staff were always prompt and pleasant to greet me, find us a table promptly, and offer tea, coffee or juices, there is a very wide range of breakfast options here, I have never found better, cereals, congee, toast, sushi and smoked salmon, egg station, fruit waffles even ice cream and frozen yoghurt, lovel
3
Was there on 27 Nov w hubs to celebrate our engagement anniversary. Food was good as usual. Initial service of ushering us to the table was OK, though they didn't prepare our baby chair beforehand as requested during our reservation and we had to wait a while. In the end we grabbed a nearby baby chair on our own. The person who supposedly bring our bb chair to us never did. They also didn't serve their signature hazelnut choco cake which I was craving for big time. Otherwise everything is acceptable. Would haven given a excellent rating to the food if they had the cake!
4
I enjoyed dinner there and lots of options and decent seafood. Was a little disappointed they ran out of beef and switched to fish, Crab legs and oysters were replenished very slowly if at all. Shrimp were good. Being from Texas the Mexican food bar was kind of funny and certainly not really Mexican or even American/Mexican. I enjoyed the meal but this could have been far better
3
I cannot put my fingers on one dish and compliment it as outstanding... All the dishes are fine to good... Services depends on whether they are crowded or not.
5
Not very much in variety as compared to other hotels, but good enough with freshly shucked Oysters, prawns, yabbies, sashimi, cooked food, eastern and western. Desserts bar is filled with macaroons, very decadent. Not bad, but expect an open setting, not a quiet atmosphere.
5
Good atmosphere, attentive staff. The spread of the food was good but some dishes were a bit too salty.
4
Was at a conference at the Conrad for work and lunch was included so I've got no idea how much this place costs.
Food was great, lots of variety and all freshly cooked. I can't really find a fault with this, I really liked it.
4
Good hotel breakfast - be prepared for s short wait at peak times.
A myriad of options from European, Malay, and fisher from across east Asia.
The sushi is particularly good.
1
I did not like this place at all. I kept trying to find the waitress to give me a refill on my water. The food was really average (especially for the high price they charge per person). I did not get my money's worth. The waitress finally started to assist me after she saw that I was not smiling and being very irritable. Then she said she was going to give me a discount since I was using a Citi bank card. When she came back she forgot to apply the discount on my bill. So she had to go back and redo it. I could not wait to get to my room. My stay in the hotel is pleasant. Dinner at Oscar's is not pleasant at all and I don't recommend it.
5
This city always amazes me with good food, found myself pigging out for breakfast after a night of good beers and this restaurant has it all. Their congee really made my tummy calmer and not to mention a wide variety of pastries, oh im stuffed, thanks to Janet (if im not mistaken) for makin the freshest orange juice for me :) I even came back for dinner that day.. their oysters definitely rocks and the best in town. Will come back definitely
3
Made a reservation through Chope for a buffet dinner for 4 person. When we reach the cafe, the service personnel cannot find our reservation initially. After checking through for a while then found our reservation. We will given a square table hiding behind a pillar away from the food. Request for a round table near the food area but was told all tables had been reserved. Food variety is only so so. The person serving the Oysters dont seems to interested to answer questions when ask about the country of origin of the oysters. The atmosphere in the cafe is also not very pleasant. Not worth the value even though the offer is one-for-one
4
Adequate seafood selection but felt the crabs were mediocre at best tasting very briny and without the succulent freshness usually associated with the dish. The 'fresh' scallops were hard as was the Hokkaido cooked ones but at least the latter was flavored well with its accompaniments. The selection of lamb, short ribs and prime rib did not disappoint. The dish of the day was the steamed fish that was very clean tasting, fresh and well accompanied with a very light soy type sauce and garnishing. The dessert selection comprised of bite sized chocolate morsels, tart pastries and gooey berry compotes
5
The Morning breakfast buffet is sumptuous and provided with wide choices-- Western, Chinese, Indian and Malay... You name it.. Another day my table was cleaned up while I was getting more food (by mistake--though my cutlery was put properly to be used again and my napkin folded on the back of my chair for me to come back ). It must have been done by an intern or a new staff. I came back surprised and scrambled to search for my lost banana (my Potassium diet for the day). They already ran out on banana by then (the people at the fruit promised to save one for me the next morning). The next morning, the same server looked for me and put a banana with a glass of water on my table. I was pleasantly surprised.The lunch buffet was thoroughly enjoyed by my friend and I ( lots of clay lobsters, oysters, large shrimps, selections of fish if you like seafood; plentiful of desserts; Western, Chinese Indian and Malay food-- the Laksa from the special noodle booth outside was great). Too bad we were not warned of the shortage of time when we were seated-- we found ourselves frantically trying to finish up 45 minutes into eating when the lunch buffet is closing up. We would appreciate people telling us beforehand so we would know how to choose. Still, the food, service in general and the place is good to deserve a 5 points.
5
Excellent breakfast with variety of food served. But could be improved further by adding more popular Asian dish. Must try the omelette station. It was fantastic and delicious. Finish it off with ice-cream. Fantastic!!!!!!
5
One of the best breakfast buffets I have experienced, and free with our room. Traditional as well as Western cuisines. Ice cream for breakfast? Why not? ;)
4
Breakfast buffet reasonable, lots of Japanese style food. Sunday lunch buffet very good but expensive.
4
Great and diverse breakfast buffet. Good selection of local and international food with fresh fruits and juices.
3
Probably limited by the size of the place. Compared to MO or PanPac nearby, this restaurant is probably the least of the 3. Spread was decent for morning breakfast but not spectacular. Could have been better.
1
These are only some of the comments.
Variety of food was limited for the price paid for .
Food was too salty
Service of waitress ( very careless ) was very bad etc
I think this was the worst buffet I ever been in Singapore
2
The spread and variety of food is only just above average.
The desserts are tend on the sweeter side.
4
Good service, all left over plate and food are cleared swiftly.
Good ambience
Good quality spread of deserts, good local and international cuisines.
5
Impeccable service, and one of the best breakfast buffets I have experienced, and free with our room. Traditional as well as Western cuisines. Ice cream for breakfast? Why not? ;) Sit outside for a bit of a quieter atmosphere, and a nice change of pace from the air-conditioning
4
Oscar's offers a good choice of Asian dishes and some western taste too; breakfast is vast with plenty of fruits, juices to choose from along with all necessary stuff to start your day in the right mood.Dinner goes a-la-carte or in buffet format, and both will meet your expectations
3
food was average, not worth the full price, so lucky there was sg50 discount. Service was good though
5
Wonderful breakfast with huge variety! Even ice cream for breakfast!!
The only complain I have is the local variety is pretty limited, always dimsum, 1 fried noodle/kueyteow/rice and porridge.
5
Amazing food very nice seafood choices , service is amazing .4 different type of fresh oysters with mussels and shrimps
5
The best buffet in town. The choice of food and service was exceptional. The fresh seafood is fresh the chilli crab is just right and the desert bar is comprehensive
4
We had breakfast and dinner there. Good selection of Asian and Western food. Staff is very courteous. We had a special rate for our dinner buffet since it was on a Wednesday, not sure if we are willing to pay full price for it.
4
I hate to see people piling up their oyster shells in buffet but this was exactly what I did tonight at Oscars in Conrad Singapore. The oysters coming from New Zealand were so fresh and creamy that none at my table could resist. The cold crab and prawns were equally as good. The buffet features also interesting hot oriental dishes with exotic spices. The flow of beer was non-stop through the evening
4
went for the a la carte instead of the buffet as we were not too hungry. Service was very good, and food was also very good, Interestingly, 20 minutes after ordering they came and told us that they were not happy with one of the dishes they had cooked so did not want to serve it. no problem as we just ordered another dish. Much rather that they did that instead of serving sub standard food. All in all a good lunch in a nice restauran
5
One of the best buffets I have eaten at. Spoiled for choice at every turn from soups, mains to desert. The freshly made chilli crab is a must. Not mention the service. For a very busy restaurant the service is excellent. Nothing is too much trouble or takes too lon
4
Wide variety of choices ranging from the traditional American breakfast with pancakes, eggs, oatmeal and cereal to Asian fare like Indian, porridge with condiments, Sushi, etc.! There is also a selection of fresh juices, cheese and pastries. The restaurant is spacious and service is courteous although, being as busy as they are, the wait staff occasionally forgot to bring the specialty coffee or tea (also included in the breakfast buffet) that we ordered.The restaurant also offers patio seating in the mornings
4
Have eaten both breakfast and lunch buffets here. As breakfast included in room rate not sure the value for money but a good choice of western and Asian. The lunch buffet we went to was reasonable value for money. I quite like the location and the outside terrac
5
Best sea food and continental in this location. Good and quick services is what you get every time. Good place to host business dinner/drinks
5
No matter the western, Chinese, or Singapore, to Malay, tons of food choices, especially like their variety of fruit juices squeeze fresh on request. Try to get there early on weekends, it may have a long line to wait to get in.
4
Good mix of cuisines at breakfast. But finding seats seems tough for the team once in a while. I likes the selection of loaf breads they had.
4
Lovely food, excellent choice on the menu.
Service can be slow though otherwise would have given an excellent rating.
5
I was recently there for a birthday and Father's day celebration. The restaurant had a good spread of food of different cuisines, and the the quality of it was excellent. Cold-served shell fish and seafood is one of the must-haves. The staff were excellent in their service. There was a slight hitch when we arrived - it was a matter of us reserving a round table but was asked to sit somewhere else instead. It was sorted out and we were given the round table due to a mix-up by the staff. When we called in for reservations, we mentioned that it was for a birthday celebration, to which the staff surprised with a cake, not just a slice but an entire cake that was sufficient for the 6 of us
2
I arrived Oscars for dinner buffet at 9pm, because I bought lot of things after shopping, need to bring up hotel room, then was a bit late. The buffet time actually is 6:30pm to 10pm.Only a few customers still there. The sushi and sashimi at Japanese counter seems been put there long hours. Some hot food display dishes were empty. A few oysters were on the ice, also very small one. I requested the chef to open 4 new oysters for me, as they have oysters from 4 different countries. But he refused. He said I can only choose from the one already on ice.I paid the same price $69++ for the buffet, why I deserve to treatment like that
5
I'm cursed with the most sensitive stomach in the family. This means I don't get to indulge in oysters and other various seafood selections. I'm happy to say that my tummy approves of the freshness and cleanliness of the seafood served at Oscar's. No nail-biting experiences on the throne after 4 glorious days of seafood spread.Special mention for the NZ oysters, slipper lobsters, yabbies, crabs and prawns...stomach is growling now recalling them :)The fruit selection is also decent and pairs wonderfully from the ice-cream selection! Go crazy while you're at it. There's lotsa toppings to go with it :DIf you prefer a little privacy, it's probably better to book ahead and request for a table facing the pubs/bar area, at the back
4
havent been to oscar for sometimes so decided have lunch during weekend.As expected oscar offer an amazing buffet spread, from fresh seafood to cooked food.If you are seafood lover, oscar is one of the best.from prawn,mussel.crabs fresh scallop to freshly suck oysters.the cooked station consist of local and western and also a wide range of japanese cuisine.the staff are attentive and polite,especially the old staff they know your preference and accomadating to your needs.The buffet worth a try with its good standard of food and excellent service
5
Without a doubt this Is the best buffet we have ever experienced. We are holidaying in Singapore to see family and made a spontaneous decision to go out for lunch. We chose by reading Tripadvisor reviews. As seafood lovers we were amazed at the range of very fresh seafood and oysters from several countries shucked as you chose them. There were plenty of other options. The desert range was incredible.No review of Oscars would be complete without mentioning the outstanding service from the staff. They were friendly, informative and highly professional.This was reasonably expensive and more than we would usually pay but real value for money
5
Came here on Saturday for lunch. Was welcomed warmly and my 4-yr old son was led in by hand by the waitress to the table. Spread was good, with free flow of canadian oysters, yabbies, prawns, cheeses, sashimi, hot laksa/prawn noodles/bakkutteh/wanton soup, peking duck, ice cream, desserts and a lot others. Service was very good too. and it wasn't very crowded
4
What you pay is what you get. A very good spread of light to heavy serving. The staff are always accommodating to your needs in extra cuts or prefer cuts.
4
if you like seafood, oscar has one of the freshest and the best. from lobster to live prawns and freshly suck oysters. cook food showcases local and western food.
4
Varied food options for all including calorie conscious to gourmets, supplemented by lightning fast service. Thoroughly enjoyable experience
5
Ambiance is great; well lit; very well laid out; not cramped and not to big. Breakfast buffet selection was sufficient. Staff are wonderfully hospital and courteous!
5
During my stay at the Conrad, I have tried their breakfast often. Great spread with choices for all sections including kids. Eggs, waffles made to order, juices and smoothies for the health conscious, all you can think of. Service is fast and seating is coordinated such that guest turnover is high

A really disappointing experience. We opted for the a la carte menu and we were served (I suspect)from the buffet. We hadn't finished our salad and we were brought our mains which were cold. The steak was over cooked and rubbery. The catch of the day was cold and the sauce covered the raw shells so that you couldn't remove them. It was horrible. We sent these back and on the second attempt all the food was hot but the steak was still dry. I can't comment on the buffets but if the cooking is anything like the a la carte I should avoid

Staying at the Conrad for Easter we visited Oscars for their Easter Sunday brunch. We decided to pay the expensive price for a different experience. We were not told about kids activities (much to the disappointment of our son) and so we only experienced the food. The range of food was vast but the quality had not been compromised. There was a huge seafood display and we sampled lots of new ones for the very first time - the Tanzanian oysters were the best! Unlimited champagne, Asian, western and hot cross buns as well!The room was FULL and people were very happy! I only wish we'd had the extra hour when the activities obviously happened. Well worth a visit if you are in the area

I always enjoyed myself dining at the Oscars. It has a warm and inviting environment where the staff are polite and attentive. Food is great. You have a good selection of freshest seafood and a mix of international cuisines from Western, Indian, Chinese, Japanese. There also have a pretty good dessert selections. A nice place for dining
4
The food selection is good.Healthy diet can be found there (greek yogurt, fruits, nuts, fish, etc).Various type of food provided (Chinese, American, European, Japanese, etc).The only thing I think that need to be improve is that the restaurant should change the menu from time to time.Though there are variety of food provided, but they are just the same everyday
3
Had a buffet lunch there. Maybe I was expecting more, so I was not thrilled on the buffet that day. I would say the variety of food are not a lot ... but it has more than enough to stuff oneself. Given another chance, I would rather spend my $$ on buffet at other hotel, and probably wont come back again
5
Loved the lunch buffet with all the different foods from all over the world. There is something for everyone at this lunch. Note that tea and coffee are complimentary but you will pay significantly for sodas.
4
Great variety of food and the service was excellent the only unfortunate thing was it was midweek and a bit quiet! Would have liked more atmosphere!
5
Good selection of both Asian and Western cuisine. Indoor or outdoor dining. Waffle station and ice cream for dessert.
5
Very good service, proactive staffs who constantly ask if you need anything else. Food quality and spread is good.
5
Four of us went for dinner, the choice was excellent. Each of us had something different and all said it was great. The only criticism is the price of beer, but that's Singapore! Will return.
5
Go for the Buffet, whether it's breakfast, lunch or dinner. The offerings are fantastic and worth the pricey fee.
4
We had breakfast at Oscars every morning we were in Singapore. The food was fresh - with things like omelets, eggs, waffles etc made to order.
5
The Terrace, and Singapore's weather is a match made in heaven. The beers are great, the ambiance is interesting and yet conducive to lingering into the middle of the night and great conversations.The Conrad is wrapped by malls that have other restaurants that are the hangouts for the owners of Ferrari cars in red, yellow, white and blue—occasionally there are other equally exotic sports cars—but the Ferrari is the main attraction.
5
To my right, the Japanese business woman is eating shashimi and then some fruit. I couldn't resist mixing a little Panang curry in my omelet, as well as mixed berry compote over a little American waffle. Then a little dragon fruit that was harvested ripe, and deep red. The coffee was perfect—softly roasted, succulent, and embracing—unlike any of the fast roasted tainted water in a paper cup and green logo. Relax over the Straits Times and catch up on the importance of the Malaysian peninsula, and feel your blood pressure calm—except when a Ferrari pulls up out on the street. A sound that is all too familiar around the Conrad.
4
My wife and I enjoyed the very well prepared and more than ample breakfast buffet. There were numerous food options to include made to order waffles, pancakes as well as eggs. The fresh fruits selection was outstanding. If you want to experiment they also offered several regional specialties that are worth trying
5
The breakfast buffet here is substantial with a great mix of eastern and western items and the usual crowed pleasers: egg station etc..
4
This is a quaint restaurant in the Conrad Singapore... The food is authentic and fresh... Service is prompt an attentive... Large portions of food add to the value... Moreover it's open 24 hours!!! Nice place for a quiet dinner
5
Wow what a great Buffett dinner. The choices were amazing. There was seafood from all over the world, a freshly made noodle bar, beef, pork,ham and the desserts were out off this world. The staff were very friendly.
5
Service excellent ate from the a la carte menu.The fish was freshly cooked very tasty and I had asked for mashed potatoes and a different veg. to accompany my fish all was no problem.The buffet looked good and was very busy always a good sign.
4
Very efficient system of handling the long queue for breakfast. Food options are quite varied with something for all including vegetarians. The staff is quite attentive and always smiling. A delightful way to start a busy day.
5
If you love lobsters, shrimps, crabs, yabbies, scallops - welcome to heaven @ Oscars! They come in all shapes and sizes, served in a bed of shaved ice but you can be assured of freshness. There is also a wide array of sashimi and sushi so you still have a choice of fish if you tire of shellfish. We had the Amazing Graze brunch on Sunday and it was well worth the dollar we spent. There was a card offer - 4 people eat for the price of 3 so, it work out to around S$70. Since Christmas was around the corner, there were plenty of sweets of the season - log cakes, stollen, cookies ... the works. The 'hot' dishes included a variety of roast meats and if you still want some Asian, Oscars has a noodle station outside the restaurant which serves the perennial laksa and wanton noodles, and even a bak-kut-teh for sampling. All in all a great brunch. Two thumbs up
5
We eat breakfast here, Edward and Tweet were fantastic. We had pre warned the hotel about my wife's gluten free diet, and they had gluten free bread, mini muffins and chocolates brownies.We also ate dinner there several times, they have a great buffet but we opted for a la carte, the fish, nasi goring, an mee goring fabulous.All the staff very friendly, efficient and helpful
4
If you decide to eat at a hotel restaurant, this is good choice with wide selection of food from salad to sushi to shellfish to asian to western selections. Fruits, ice cream, dessert. Food quality is acceptable but not great. Sunday night Buffett is value for money. Service average.
4
Beautiful fresh buffet food. Fresh oysters form 4 different countries, fresh lobster and sushi. They also come around to each table to serve individual lobster bisque. Presentation of the food is very beautiful. You have an option to have unlimited champagne if you wish.The desserts are especially beautiful and they are very pleasing to the eye.The service was excellent
2
Very poor service (after people leave from their dinner tables , all tables are not cleaned of dishes, plates, glasses, napkins, nothing at all !!! You are surrounded by dirty tables while you are still eating !!! worse than a cantine or a Kopitiam or Hawker centers ! At the Conrad !!!! shameful. Wonder who are the people running so called 5 stars hotels like Conrad today !?
5
Very nice Sunday buffet. Extensive varieties of food. Nice desserts to top it off. Nice ambience with indoor and outdoor seating. Reasonable menu spread but food quality-wise, it differs. Staff are generally attentive
4
Very fresh and good variety of oysters, obsters, crabs, prawns and shashimi. Noodle bar has good quality bak-kut teh, prawn noodles and laksa. Very attentive service staff
3
Nice ambience with indoor and outdoor seating. Reasonable menu spread but food quality-wise, it differs. Staff are generally attentive but had unpleasant experience with some curt service staff.
3
This restaurant is conveniently located in the Conrad hotel. You can sit inside or on the terrace. We chose to sit outside. The food was above average and the service was attentive.
4
The booking from Chope is easy and convenient. Seating arrangement was perfect for my family of 4 in round table.
5
The server was very attentive and noticed when my napkin fell from my lap to the ground, she came from behind the counter and out to the terrace with a clean napkin. Great service.
4
I feel the buffet dinner in Oscar is nothing special when compared to other 5 stars hotel restaurants except its selection of raw oysters. There are altogether 9 types of oysters from New Zealand, Australia, France, USA & Canada to choose from (3 types from France). They are delicious. The restaurant assistants will open these oysters for you after you have made your selection. The buffet dinner cost S$80 per person during weekends and a bit less during weekdays.
3
We go to Oscar's every year around this time of the year but this might be our last. Oscar used to be well known for its Oyster selection but the oyster section this time had only 4 varieties now. Foie gras servings are getter smaller by the year. I was not impressed to find ICE KACHANG for dessert at Oscar's. Cheese selection also less exciting, the very common brie and edam. Not even a blue cheese in sight. Scallop dish was overcooked and dried up under the hot lamp. Baked salmon had a way too salty breaded crust which was difficult to swallow for me despite me having a palate that loves very salty food. Asked for ice coffee but was told they don't serve complimentary iced coffee, so we asked for a hot coffee with a glass of ice on the side, they got the message and served us iced coffee eventually. The good part was a better display of crustaceans this time which is great. We were there from 12 -3pm and felt the place was really empty this time of year, there were barely 50 guests, which speaks for itself i guess.
3
Food is just so-so including the seafood. For S$ 80+++, we were served only slipper lobsters which is disappointing. No lobster bisque soup which was also a downer. The scallop was overcooked and French oysters were small-sized. Overall not a good gastronomic experience given the restaurant's hype and reputation
3
we were invited by friends from overseas to a brunch at oscars. We arrived at 10:15am and had to learn that the buffet will be closed at 10:30..., so three of took the buffet and hurried away to fill the plate and three of us ordered a la carte. I strolled to the buffet but was very disappointing what I saw as most things were already gone..and the impression of the overall selection wasn t good. I had ordered my favorite out of home breakfast: eggs Benedict. But the first round the eggs were so under cooked that I had to return it and guess what the second time the eggs were over cooked. So overall I had so much higher expectations at the Conrad. They won't see us for a breakfast brunch again. Singapore has so many better breakfast places.
4
The selection of buffet though limited, it offers one of the freshest seafood selection, mainly oysters. The service provided was impressive as well. The price are average considering that the food was finely cooked and the ambience of the restaurant was warm & cosy.
5
Everything was fresh and finely cooked! Really enjoyed the fact it was 24hrs so it helped curve those late night munchies!
4
If you go to Oscars you have to have the Nasi Goreng! Well ok you don't obviously but I would strongly recommend you do. The F1 drivers apparently come here for it each year and I can see why. Its incredible!
4
Love the wanton noodles, bah kut teh, my wife didn't like the beef but the service and food is good. Sadly my wife said the beef was a disappointment. Anyway~
5
We had the best Nasi Gorang and we returned a couple of nights later and the same waitress remembered what we had ordered on the previous visit. Food great and the waitress was lovely and recommended what to order.
3
Could be due to that we came late at 1.30 after our meeting, the quality of the buffet was not what I expected for a restaurant in Conrad, though spread was ok.
4
Great buffet featuring a variety of different foods from different Asian regions. The wait line is a little long around 7:30am
2
Although everyone has highly recommend this restaurant, after try & tested....the food was terrible especially the tom yum, laksa, chocolate cake (claim as favourite/specialty), juice & fruitsTom yum was dilute~no taste of the usual thai gong styleLaksa was dilute~tasteless as the gravy not thick enough.Chocolate cake~terrible. Fruits~watermelon & jambu is tasteless (plain) & longan was spoiltShould I try for their dinner buffet?. Maybe..Thank you so much for Ms Carol for hosting my pre-birthday lunch (=^^=
3
Food is fresh n spread is slightly more than the average price hotel dinner buffet. However, the food taste doesn't meet my expectation. I expected more because of the good reviews. Chicken, prawn noodle soup are delicious. There are different country oysters( which is what draw me to this restaurant - sadly, most tasted too salty ). The desserts are pretty standard, except the waffle n ice kacang (delicious). Lots of chocolates n candies which aren't what i'm looking for in a buffet dinner. Think I m paying more for the ambience n location n quantity but not quality.
4
Stayed at Conrad many times over the years and enjoyed the excellent dining options at Oscars...buffet is one of the best I have tasted. Menu choices also very good...option of dining inside with air con or the terrace outside with ceiling fans and sports on the tv screens.This visit was for lunch at the cafe at the opposite end of the terrace and a new venue for me as it was not here the last time we stayed. Nice comfy seating and a very good snack menu with some excellent sandwiches, salads and cakes...very good friendly service...well recommended..
5
A really good buffet breakfast with a wide variety of food of different cultures. Highly recommended.
5
Had Breakfast here, there were lots to choose from and the quality of the food was tops, and the service is first class, really enjoyed our breakfast there.
4
The buffet at Oscar's is fitting of a Conrad Hotel. It is pricey but it is plentiful and the staff are very accommodating. If they don't have it, they will try and get it for you.
5
Best international breakfast you can get in Singapore :)
The service staff is forever friendly as well.
5
The choice of variety has really a lot, regardless or having a breakfast or brunch or even dinner there. The food there are really tasty and most importantly, their live stations are really good! :)
3
Food selection as very good, but the restaurant was overcrowded and very noisy which took away the pleasure of eating there. Won't be back.
4
Have dine in Oscar more than 5 times in the past 1 year. As usual, there's no complains about the food and service staff. Today, there's hair in my ice cream. Reported to restaurant manager, immediately he apologies and checked what happen backend. Didn't expect him to come back and feedback, gave us a name card and personally apologies another time to look for him the next round. He will ensure that all is good. Fast & good recovery. Good Job. Will definitely bring my family & friends to dine there again
4
Terrific selection of foods -- from Asian fresh fruits, as-you-watch freshly-made pancakes and waffles, an entire section of Asian dishes and traditional US and European breakfast foods. Service was fantastic - a lady named Ice was a favorite server. Downside - it gets very crowded with tourist groups and lots of children -- key to beat this is to visit early (before 7:30 am, which is not hard to do if you are visiting from US as you are awake early do to jet lag.
5
This restaurant can be loud and crowed at times. It can also be pretty pricey. However it is by far my favorite restaurant in the entire world, the food is amazing and the unlimited buffet is something that you cannot find at too many places around the globe. If you love seafood, you have to visit
4
Came here with my company as part of our Chinese New Year company lunch. Really happy with the choice to dine here ! The restaurant was spacious and modern with a classy elegant atmosphere. For the lunch buffet, the selection was varied ranging from Westin to Asian. The food was delicious and always replenished quickly . The ingredients were fresh and of good quality. The staff is friendly, fast service despite a crowded restaurant on that day. Shall bring my family here very soon for our next buffet gathering 
4
We had a delicious lunch at Oscars, but the bill was eye-watering.
Great food, and good service though. Could not be faulted!
I recommend the club sandwich
4
Nice seating area outside, perfect for a cigar or two under the ceiling fans. Too bad prices are kinda steep and service can be wanting at times.
5
Brilliant. The food is superb. Have had breakfast and dinner here a number of times. Love love love it.
4
It was a real bonus to find they served 24 hours. so no struggling for room service after a long flight
4
Good buffet selection in a nice restaurant. Went as a group for company luncheon and there is something for everyone. The dishes were well cooked and fresh. The service was attentive and efficient. Good lunch choice if you have time to spare.
4
The resterant is open 24/7, offers wide food selection, intenational cuisine, to suit every taste. Morning, lunch dinner tasty buffet, beautifully arranged, very colorful, appealing presentation. After hours, a la carte menu is served. Service is a bit slow, not always engough waiters, and rather expensive
4
We had b'fast during our 8 day stay at The Conrad Centennial, very good spread....continental and Asian fare served along with fresh juices, smoothies, waffles n ice-cream, pastries, a variety of bread, fresh veggies and fruit....the list is quite extensive. They also have an egg station. The fare remains relatively the same everyday and just a couple of food items are changed and it tends to get a bit monotonous. The staff is friendly and look after you really well
4
If your choice for a late breakfast is brunch and like Champagne at the same time and you happen to be in Singapore then the great news is there is plenty of choice with brilliant selections around the many 5-star hotels.........After a great birthday party night I headed down from my room at the Conrad and dug into the excellent brunch at Oscar's.......wow what a great selection and what selection of Champagne, no other than Veuve-Clicquot NV Brut.....well I was tempted and okay a glass does little harm.........the beautiful buffet is well laid out with every choice of seafood, cheese, noodles, salads & desserts you can dream about.......the best part is the friendly service staff serve the soup & main course.....as I love a good Lobster bisque I had to try it and served up in style it was with the taste to match! The main course selection was between six different styles from Pan-seared Goose Liver, Wagyu Shortrib to King Prawns........oh well in view of my diet was going south at this point I headed straight for the pan-seared Goose Liver and wow was it good, a small very tasty portion.......yum.........as my attention turned to dessert I was constrained and just had a nice mix of fruits, cheese oh yes and a small chocolate hazelnut cake.......yep calories galore......but very tasty!! I managed to walk away feeling well rounded and really enjoyed the buffet..........oh well and the bubbles........another glass sir? Okay twist my arm.......I think I just might have to come back and try and few more of the sweets....

Looking for a place for some comfort food after a night of revelry and ended up in Oscars at Conrad. Perhaps it was late but the menu items were rather limited and we were tempted to go away in search of more choices elsewhere but instead we stayed and ate some rather boring - and not very comforting - food. Considering the fact that there are quite a number of watering holes nearby and patrons may want a late-night "makan," Oscars would do well to think about enlarging its offerings
4
Part of the Conrad, a lovely bar & restaurant used for breakfast, lunch & dinner, very late bar, in fact could be open all night. Has outside seating along a covered walkway around the Conrad with comfy sofas and small tables etc, good for drinks &/or food, nice atmosphere outside. The restaurant is large and very good although more as a hotel style eating place not as a bespoke romantic atmosphere but food is good compares well with local restaurants. Good place to people watch as the car park around the Conrad is used by many playboys parking their Ferraris and Lambos!!
4
I went there for the Amazing Graze on a Sunday and there was a wonderful spread with good service and delicious food. However, it is on the pricy side.
5
Food and service quality is consistent; the buffet menu is changed regularly and the freshness is guaranteed. Come anytime and enjoy the breeze if seated in the terrace, it is the perfect choice for good food and great company
4
It has something for everyone. Huge selection of cereal, breads, fruit. Made to order fruit juices, eggs. A variety of asian foods.
Might have some wait in the morning though.
3
Found both the food and the service pretty ordinary and not up to what I would expect in a hotel such as the Conrad.
In fairness it was a very busy night and only ate there on the one occasion.
5
Enjoy a marvelous buffet with a excellent choice of Asian as well as Western food. One of the best buffet dinners ever had!
5
Have stayed in a LOT of hotels worldwide offering a buffet breakfast. Oscars shines through as one of the very best. An extremely good selection of local and western breakfast options, including a very friendly chef dedicated to cooking eggs and omelettes.Greeted by every member of staff in the restaurant and made to feel very welcome. Would use this restaurant/hotel again without question in the future.Arrived very late one night and received the same impeccable service with a burger on the patio
3
for the price that we were paying, i was expecting a bit more from this buffet. this has got to be the buffet with the littlest options.. the food wasn't exemplary either, just so-so. the upside of it all was that the food was warm enough and the servers were quite attentive
3
went there for lunch today. I expect the grand placement of food items, good service from staff and high standard of food offered. and I am greeted with grand layout of restaurant and good service of staff only. I thought there'll be a wide selection of international food items, but there wasn't. the food was not at top notch standard as well considering the price I paid. replenishment of food was not fast as well which is a bit disappointing. chefs standing there was not warm enough to ask if we need help on certain food. lucky that dessert save the lunch. it was the best compared to the rest, although selection are little. with such costly meal, i expect more from Oscars
4
We went to Oscar's for celebrating our son birthday. The buffet was nicely organized and with several options of local and international cuisine. I was particularly happy to see a great variety of seafood including fresh oysters and crabs and shrimps. Sushi and Sashimi were also good. In the salad corner there were several options too... although I was not so impressed with the Caesar's salad they prepared for me, it was very small and with very little Parmesan cheese. The cheese corner was quite impressive and so was the desserts one which included many chocolate rich options and warm waffles and ice cream. Service might be improved in the sense that there is a lot of staff around but it could be warmer and more attentive; also some of the buffet options are not quickly replenished. Overall we were satisfied and would not mind coming back in the future
5
We had a meal at Oscars on our last night in Singapore. We were staying at the Conrad so it was a good a place as any to start. We sat outside on the terrace as the air conditioning in the restaurant is way to cold to be comfortable. The service is very prompt and friendly. Although the al la cart menu is limited, the buffet looked spectacular, but we are not big eaters so for us al la cart is the way to go. My husband had a steak with string fries and mushroom sauce, which he said was quite alright. I had Seafood Tom Yum which was delicious. The price of the food is quite good. My meal was S$23.00 which I thought was very reasonable as it came with extra chilli and a side of rice. Of course there is the beautiful fresh bread that comes before the meal which is all part of the service. We ate early so there was only a few people. Just be aware that if you are not smokers and sit outside that even if you sit in the no- smoking area as we did that you will get smoke wafting into your area, so if this bothers you at all it would be better for you to sit inside.....if you can stand the freezing air con
5
So much to choose from it almost gives you choice stress. Cool insight, but always a place to sit outside. One of the best breakfast restaurants ever.
3
Good service, but nothing special for breakfast. I did like their noodle bar at lunch, but their portions are a bit small considering the wait.
5
This appears to be just another hotel cafe but the food is wonderful with some first rate values on the various promotions - happy hours and they have a very chatty bar area where it is easy to make new friends
4
Oscar restaurant serve good and huge variety of buffet for breakfast, lunch and dinner, open 24hrs. They have fusion food. Eggs will cook on the spot upon order. They do serve nice ice cream for breakfast.
4
As a busy restaurant in a cosmopolitan city like Singapore the breakfast buffet has something for everyone, whether you want ice cream with waffles or noodles with chili, with pretty much everything in between for breakfast.For dinner the buffet is a wide range, with some excellent curries from all around the region, and often large roasts carved to order.It is not the cheapest in town, but it is reliably good and a hungry guy like me always gets value for money :-
5
Oscars had been recommended to me by other family members and I'm pleased to say it did not disappoint! I went for their famous and highly regarded Nasi Goreng which was ridiculously good! Other family members had the dinner buffet which they also were very impressed with!Overall a fantastic experience and I would highly recommend Oscar's to everyone visiting Singapore! Make sure you have the Nasi Goreng!
4
Fantastic dinning experience ! Spread was ok, cold cut section very fresh, especially crayfish, prawns are of good quality. Commendable staff service level, very attentive and diligent. Order warm water and staff would come back check the pot and ensure we have water. I would pay for the price to dine again
3
This review is for the buffet at Oscar's. The spread looks enticing but unfortunately the quality and taste of the food does not live up to the promise of the presentation. Among the best things on the spread are those that the in-house chefs have not prepared, with the exception of the noodle bar. The western food is kind of OK by the Singapore standards. However, the Asian and Indian food is appallingly bad...food-court level at best. Fortunately the deserts save the day.Will not recommend it..not at the 75++/person price point
5
The variety in this buffet is fantastic. Not quite as good as the one we had at the Oscars at the Waldorf Astoria in Orlando but not too far off it. Didn't try the dinner or lunch but seemed pretty busy so assume it was good quality as there are a dozen restaurants outside the door of the hotel and people were still eating there.
4
Oyster is very fresh and there are types of oysters which it is my first time seeing it. Cook are very helpful to intro their type of oyster. Sashimi is very fresh also. Variety of food is not alot. But very happy with the service given by the staff. My fiancÃ© and I enjoyed our anniversary dinner with Oscar's cafe and terrace! Will come back again!
4
This breakfast restaurant offers large selection of food at a reasonable price. The dishes change every day and the service is fast and polite
4
Although the atmosphere of the restaurant itself is rather "mainstream", the food is really good. Nice, not too big choice of food, prices absolutely ok. Try the Cesar's salad. Will be prepared at your table in a big Parmigiano cheese. Service was a bit slow.
4
Very recomended for breakfast, Complete and good taste. From Fresh Juice till Ice Cream. They let you mix some fresh juice directly from the juicer. The waffle is very good when you eat with Nutella and Peanut Butter.
4
Great range of food for dinner. But get there early. Fresh fruit ran out before we got to it and it wasn't replaced. Some of the dishes were looking a little dried up towards the end of service
5
breakfast here is good with a wide array of selections. There is a choice to sit inside or in the terrace but its a bit too warm for singapore weather in the morning / day. Coffee was lovely and the pastries a good match.
5
Great breakfast buffet and great choices for tea. The service is true 5star and the staff cannot do enough for you.
5
I was there on a sunday morning with hubby for a nice leisurely buffet style breakfast. Carparking at the hotel was hassle-free. Both the hotel and restaurant staff were very attentive and highly efficient. This quality sets the hotel apart from the masses. I have been there several times before, even stayed at the hotel and each time I get the same consistently high quality attention and service. Breakfast was awesome. I am not a big eater so for me it was the nice healthy juices of your own choice - I had two glasses! And, freshly brewed coffee straight from the Nespresso machine. Food apart, I noticed that the strategically placed stations inside the restaurant for the service staff enable them to work the entire restaurant very effectively. They were able to respond to guests' requests very quickly. I was very impressed by the level of attentiveness even when they were seemingly busy with tasks. They even provided a coat hanger for one of the patrons who had a jacket! I would have expected this from a formal dining restaurant, not a busy morning breakfast place.To top it all, all the wonderful staff have such a nice and pleasant smile on their faces. They truly deserve an Oscar for their dedication to the craft of service
4
I eat breakfast here frequently and the buffet is very good. They have a tremendous variety and are always trying new things. There is a solid representation of western and Asian favourites along with fresh fruit juices and smoothies; ice cream; waffles; and specialty coffees. No need for lunch! Can be very busy but wait times beyond five or ten minutes would be rare.Can be difficult to get staff's attention for a coffee refill occasionally otherwise the service is excellent
4
Amazing range of food, styles and pretty much everything you ever wanted for breakfast (and probably all other meals). I dont think I have ever had access to a wide selection of ice creams for breakfast! Downside, is it is very much priced as a special treat place more than where you might pop in before work for a reasonably light breakfast
4
We stayed in the hotel with the option of breakfast here daily. we ate there 3 times and really enjoyed it. There was an omlette station and another station cooking pancakes and waffles. I never got around to having iceream for breakfast but you coud if you wanted. Get a yoghurt smoothie. They are great. You have to ask for them
5
Reasonable value. Great Asian and Indian menu. Very friendly. I asked to seated near power for my laptop and they couldn't have worked harder to help me. Very spicy and tasty Tom Yum soup.
5
Got a free breakfast here as part of the room package. Food selection was great and taste was also great.
5
Great food that covers every taste and impeccable service. I loved the American Breakfast but the Chinese breakfast looked delicious and the fruit was incredible.
5
The buffet at Oscar's is the best you can get in Singapore. Amazing and full of choices with authentic taste.
3
The focus is on seafood, hence the price which is pretty high. The other dishes really are not very special. Service inside is good but if you are sitting outside its hard to get the staff's attention. Its OK but nothing to write home about.
3
You get some really fine dining experience over here, take some cash with you but its worth ity. Try to be earlier to get a good table.
5
This is our family's favourite restaurant. We first chanced on this place when we were looking for a place to celebrate our son's 21st birthday. Being Singaporeans, we are spoilt for choice for buffets. Having read some good reviews, I decided to go ahead. I called to request for quiet corner for some family time. Also, to be allowed to bring our own wine. On the day, all our requests were acceded to. The dinner buffet spread was wonderful, oysters & sashimi were fantastic. All service staff were very attentive to customers' need. The waffle station staff gave us such an entertaining time. He was knowledgeable and proud of his job, giving out his recommendations of the different types of topping for the waffles.The staff, lead by Manager, Mr Fernandos, gave my son a surprise by gathering around singing a birthday song and presenting him with a cake. Such personal service! We had a wonderful and memorable evening there.Ever since, we always come back to Oscar's whenever we craved for good food and good service. Over time, we have built up friendship with Fernando and it's such a joy that each time we visit, he would come over to chat and update about his family. I must say the quality and spread of dinner buffet is much better than lunch as we had tried both. So, I would recommend that you go for the dinner buffet if you are lookng for good quality food. Avoid weekends if you can, it's too crowded and more expensive too. We are looking forward to our next visit in July - to celebrate our son's birthday again
5
At $39.00 a person, this is a pricey breakfast, but the food was wonderful. Offering flavorful breakfast dim sum, congee with all the fixings and a wonderful assortment of American and Asian breakfast items this is a breakfast that will easily see you through till dinner. We loved the coffee bar offering everything from custom smoothies to expresso and hot chocolate

the buffet spread at oscars is brilliant in beautiful setting. the spread is totally comprehensive with two soup choices, complete salad section, including salad station where the cheff was preparing salad to order, caeser salad etc. no effort appears to be spared to make a wholesome salad DIY as well. ingredients like sun dried tomatoes, variety of chutnies, dressings are provided.bread spread covers a variety of freshly baked breads from the light white to wholesome multi grains accompanied with many types of cheeese- very enticing indeed .starters comprised escargots. prawns and crayfish. small station of japanese cuisine sashimi, shushi,tempura etc catered to those wishing to try out japanese food.main dishes included potatoes, baked vegetables and cuts of lamb and salmon with accompanying sauces.the cheffs were also manning the stations to provide on site assitance, if necssarya long list of desserts included local cakes (kueh), western cakes,thoughtfully cut in bite size. and ice cream embellished with a variety of nuts and and dried fruits. children were seen to with a good range of candy.all this was topped up with variety of freshly prepared range of chocolates.the indian vegetarian section appears to be a fair effort but certainly lacked authencity.singapoore has cosmopolitan population and visitors and it appears that great pains have been taken to cater to as many needs as possible.the spread is very good value for money and enjoyable in beautiful setting.. .

For a hotel restaurant, this place is VERY good. Great selection of buffet dishes both Asian and Western. I really enjoyed the fish congee with the topping bar next to it. Service is prompt and attentive. No complaints about this joint other than the cost...but of course, it's a hotel restaurant
5
Great Asian sea food, enormous variety and extremely well presented by brilliant staff. Patio breakfasts a bit moderate.
5
A really good breakfast buffet with a wide range of multi ethnic cuisine and highly competent omelette and waffle chefs.
3
Good variety but quite bland food. Luckily, there are many restaurants just across the main door. Choose one of them.
4
Dinner buffet has sushi, fresh oysters/lobster/king crab, several cooked to order entrees, gelato, many desserts, salads, etc etc.You will pay a lot but a really high quality meal.
2
Went specially to try the breakfast buffet and left disappointed. Variety at breakfast buffet cannot justify the price, nothing exceptional. Paid SGD91.00 for 2 persons. Better to go to The Line at Shangri-la Hotel.
4
The choice for breakfast is quite "normal" for five star chain hotels. However, the seafood buffet dinner at Oscars is something to die for. Shellfish, (small) lobsters, oysters - all you can eat - at a reasonable price: check it out and go for it.
5
Wonderful Breakfast! Large group handled with speed and efficiency. They opened at 2:00 A.M. to serve a group departing from a cruise vacation.
5
Went there to celebrate my birthday in october 2012. Food was fantastic! Loved the oysters, ice cream, crab and chocolate truffles. Ambience was lovely. Service was impeccable as well. At only $59++ for a weekday dinner, seriously you'll get your money's worth and then some. I thought that 10@Claymore was good but I admit now that I have overrated it, because Oscars is so much better overall (especially service-wise)
5
We've tried their buffet dinner a few times during the last couple of years and it's still good value for money. The varieties of food is generous for different types. There is enough of choice to satisfy all palates. Their seafood section-including oysters-is well worth checking out. Of course their is also the sushi, Indian, Chinese and European stations. The dessert section is quite impressive. Staff is very friendly and service attentive. It is defenitely price worthy
3
I used this place to smoke outside. It is not really appealing especially in the evening as it is a bit dark and depressing but is is the only alternative to have a drink whilst smoking. It has potential but it definitely needs refreshing to create an atmosphere
5
Top quality food and excellent choice for buffet breakfast. Try the freshly prepared waffles with ice cream and a variety of toppings.
3
Was there for breakfast, a moderate selection of western and chinese cuisine. They had congee as well.
4
Good quality and variety of food with friendly wait staff. Prices are a bit on the high side. No reservations needed when I was there.
4
Not fully at "The Line"´s level, but very nice anyway.
Great food and a very nice restaurant. Well worth a visit.
5
At 6pm when we arrived to eat, yes the restaurant was quite empty, but when travelling with a 7 month old this is what we needed. We were staying at the hotel, so did call to book a table and let the staff know we would be bringing an infant.On our arrival, they had a high chair already setup with plastic tableware - they couldn't do enough to assure us and help us in anyway. Including allowing us to order food for our daughter first before we had a chance to sit down and read the menu.We did order A La Carte, despite there being a wonderful buffet, which we would have had if we weren't in a bit of a rush. We chose from the Singapore section of the menu, which was cooked to order from the Noodle Section; it was hot, fresh and tasty.The staff were attentive, friendly, personable and sociable - which made us enjoy the meal even more. A relaxed yet dining atmosphere is hard to pull off and I do think the staff in Oscars have got the balance right.I would definitely dine in Oscars again if we ever get to return to Singapore

I brought my mum and sis as a lunch treat, but an incident turned our lunch sour.The food itself was decent, with some 'hits' such as the Caesar salad, Roasted Pork Knuckle and Chocolate Royal, but most of the fare was average, e.g. crayfish meat was tough, salmon was over- and then under-cooked. I read about the Wagyu sliders but they were not available during lunch, so do take note. Service itself was mediocre; my stick is with their not clearing our plates which meant we either had to clear them ourselves or stack them nice, which is not expected for a hotel of its purported statue. The incident which made this visit a bad one, especially for my sister, was when we discovered remnants in her tea pot. When we asked the waitress about this, she just took it away and got a male colleague to bring a fresh pot. When we asked the waiter, he informed us that it was ginger (it did not look or smell like ginger though) from its previous use, and apologised for this. My sister felt sick at the thought that it had been used in a previous serving, and possibly contained soap/detergent, assuming it was washed before its current use. The waiter was apologetic and gave us a 15% discount off our total bill. Which was a kind gesture, but cannot detract from the disgust we felt at such a basic and unhygienic mistake.For a restaurant in a hotel, this is unacceptable. For this reason, I will not recommend this hotel. More importantly, I'm bringing this to everyone's attention so that they don't have to go through the same experience as my sis did. Hopefully, it is a one-off; if it is not, please report it here so other patrons will know.There are so many better places to eat at. Gonna give this one a miss, cos it couldn't get the simple basics right

Tried this as an option for Sunday semi brunch. Although a good selection of seafood including lobster, oysters and crab are available, this brunch option should not be considered on the same level as Melt, Raffles, Hyatt etc. this is much more a standard buffet(semi). Cheaper option but not worth the price
3
I guess I should have had low expectations: after all it's a standard business hotel buffet, but I was hungry and hadn't had a buffet for a while.We sat outside which was nice. Ordered some wine which was tasty when chilled but as it warmed up wasn't so good. Then dived into the buffet. Stand buffet fare: good selection of salads, OK selection of seafood (with a million locals fighting over it) and great dessert section.Wouldn't rush back as the bill was much higher than I was expecting
4
Staying at the Conrad as a Hilton HHonors Gold Member. Buffet is included in as one of the benefits. I had stayed here back in Nov 2008 and remembered how good this buffet was (the dinner seafood buffet I recall was even better) and was one of the reasons I selected the Conrad again.The choices are endless and plentiful, the service is extremely attentive and courteous, and the atmosphere is decidedly upbeat and bright. The danish and croissants are outstanding and the dim sum was a very nice surprise
5
This is a great restraunt whether you are with family or with your business partners. You must try this place for some wonderful sea food, lovely wine and a fantastic ambeince!
5
There is something for everyone at this venue. We were blown away by the choices at breakfast. The fresh cooked waffles were my hubby's favourite.The staff are highly efficient and friendly.
5
The location is excellent, the food choices are many and the omlettes are tasty. The staff were very attentive and helpful.
5
When you think buffet you think downmarket, not here! This takes buffet to the highest level, a relaxed way to dine on delicious food.
4
We had the dinner buffet. I simply love the variety of fresh oysters shuckled infront of you as you ordered. There were also crayfish, mussels, clam and big prawns on ice. The desserts was equally wonderful. Would definitely come back.
5
I had a bad dining experience in Oscar few weeks ago! But Edward, assistant manager has given me and my family a memorable and happy dinner tonight! I have decided to give Oscar a chance to prove their services! Indeed they made it! They have made my mummy have a very happy and memorable birthday tonight! Once again, I would like to thank Edward and his teams for the birthday dinner arrangement tonight! Well done

We went as a party of 22 for my father's birthday & were very pleased by the food offerings as well as the service. Was shocked to read NGEW's review as our visit was exemplary. It was for Sunday brunch & was a change from the usual Chinese 10 course dinner. I assure you none in our part were disappointed! The service staff were international & came from countries as diverse as Malaysia, the Philippines & South Korea as well as Singapore. Water was topped up promptly & plates removed as soon as the server was done. No complaints in this department. And all done with a smile.The selections were ample choice but what I liked better was an a la carte menu where a diner could order off as well. This contained dishes such as pork belly, pan seared foie gras, wagyu beef cheek, profiteroles. Our entire party loved this option & ordered extensively. The portions can in nice tasting sizes so you needn't be sated. What I especially liked was that the restaurant manager arranged for my father to receive a cake with candles & the staff gathered round to sing to him!! He was a happy man & I really couldn't have asked for more
5
I dined at Oscar’s in May ’12 & my feedback on the food & service were at best “needing improvements”. I dined there again in Sept ’12 & I say emphatically & categorically that ev'ry area of my feedback is now an area worthy of laudable compliments.Praises of their servitude extends beyond this restaurant (Oscar’s) to the other departments. Being a frequent traveler I could say that, “Ev'ry staff in ev'ry hotel live/love to serve, but the underlying fabric of great morale comes from great leadership.”; Conrad’s staff boasts of being well taken care of by the hotel, & happy staff do make great servers

We went to this restaurant on 14/09/12 in a group of 10 people. I was very disappointed in the service. Our plates were not cleared! We got to clear tge plates ourselves! No one top up water for us till someone saw my cousin took the jar and top up himself. He quickly topped up for us. One issue which upset me the most was when I took 2 plates of red snappers and wanted to take the third plate for my aunts and mother. The lady who is in charge of frying the snapper gave me one rude look and refused to give the third plate to me. Her look tell me that I have already took 2 plates, I should not take the third plate. I paid for the buffet for 10 persons! Why should I get this type of treatment? I am just very disappointed in this restaurant. With this price, I can go to The Line and get good services
5
Oscars breakfast buffet is always busy, but you never have to wait for more than a few minutes for a table and the food is excellent. We had breakfast there four mornings and I cannot fault the service or food. You may have to wait a couple of minutes for your omelette made to order, but it will be tasty and fresh, as are all the food choices you have. I especially loved the fresh made waffles with strawberries, maple syrup and vanilla bean ice cream. The staff were outstanding and should be commended for their excellent service
4
Buffet Breakfast is over flowing.
Buffet Dinner is times two!
All in all - Oscars offers more than you can ask for. :)
4
Though it cost around sgd80 per person, but it has an extravagant spread of Food including variety of osyters from australia, france, canada which will makes you stuck in the oyster counter.
5
Nice place to be. we enjoyed the cafe and like to visit again
5
The breakfast here is a foodies dream. There is everything to choose from
5
Oscar's offers a wonderful buffet : you get everything you would like : langoustines, scallops, mussels, schrimps , asian dishes, western dishes, meat , fish , a wonderful salad bar , an extraordinary dessert buffet , you just name it and if you are over 60 , you get a 50 percent discount . A real bargain . Very good choice of wines

Spent my birthday celebration at Oscar. The food was fantastic; simply love the wide spread of local and international dishes - fresh oysters from various parts of the world, cheese platter, fresh Caesar salad made in a huge cheese bowl, seafood (lobster, crayfish, prawns, mussles, etc), Bak Kut Teh, Prawn noodles, a variety of freshly-cut sashimi, pork knucle, roast leg of lamb, Indian curries, many other cooked dishes of beef, chicken, fish and of course, not forgetting to mention a HUGE spread of desserts (cakes, chocolate, ice cream, waffles, and local kuehs!).In addition to the fantastic food, I am speechless about the service. The manager was observant and noted that it was my birthday - he and his staff presented me with a yummy cake, birthday song and well wishes. A pleasant surpise indeed! Such a unforgettable experience! *like
4
For those who like to try Singaporean food such as chicken rice, bak kut the, nasi goreng and alike but who don't like the setting of a food court, oscar's is for them. Of course, it will cost SGD23 instead of SGD5 oreven less in a food court. Nevertheless, the food is good and the portions are big. My favorite is Nasi Goreng: the fried rice with prawns are delicious
5
Been staying at Conrad Hotel a few times last year and will be doing so again next week. The buffet breakfast is simply awesome and the coffee served is the best I've had in Singapore, even served plain. I only wish I have enough room in my stomach to keep eating all the different variety of food they serve. Be sure to try the smoked salmon which is absolutely fresh tasting and slithers smoothly down your throat, and the crispy bacon that is quickly snapped up by the guests as soon as it comes out on the buffet counter
3
It was a very hot afternoon in Singapore and a friend took us to Oscar's for lunch.The buffet food was very nice but not really what I was hoping for. The puddings were yummy and we had a few too many !The waiters took a very long time to clear our plates away maybe they were short handed that day
5
One place in Singapore you can't do without for a restraunt to dine in for great Western and Local food. The great ambience of this eating joint is simply out of this world. Excellent service, awesome attention to details and genuine smiles from the staff members, just unbelievable. Bravo
4
Oscar's offers a good assortment of Asian and Western food, all of which is well prepared and presented. A good choice if you're in the Millennia Walk area of Singapore, or staying at the Conrad.
5
We have here every morning before we walk touring Singapore. Excellent menu.
5
The Grammy Oscar Of Food. Enough said. super wonderful experience in a cozy environment. love the ambience and cuisine in buffet style, anytime of the week.
5
Great selection for breakfast buffet,staff are courteous but chance upon a crowded saturday morning and the place was under staffed.
5
Don't miss the fish and chips. I know this sounds a funny thing to eat in Singapore - but WOW do they do it well? Very good helping.
5
Incredible selection, pricey if you have to pay for it, but included with executive level.
4
Singapore is not so difficult to get around. Its quite logical actually. Get a cab. Efficiently, the cab owners hate traffic as much as the next person. Receipts are usually given before asked. Tips yes, i would fully recommend especially when its not expected. The Conrad is a grand old dame, a high end Hilton, where staff are on full alert. The lunch crowd is generally the professional sort, with a choice of non-smoking or smoking sections, both comfortable. Buffet was displayed proudly, sufficient and not over the top. How much can you eat anyway? My partner chose the fish and chips after hearing it was tried and tested positively we put it to the test. In not more than 8 minutes, our ala carte order came. 2 chunks of lightly beer battered fish with chips wrapped in 'mock' newspaper, a healthy dose of tatar sauce and a healthy wedge of lemon. it was a cheeky lunch so i ordered a large glass of New Zealand's Oysterbay at $13 per glass. i opted for the buffet: a trio of lamb cuts , veal on garlic potato puree with sauteed oyster mushrooms (i beleive), a slice of seared red snapper, roasted duck, and no carbs... actually had second helpings of tortellini in cream sauce with bits of crispy bacon (Oscar is non-halal) . Yumm was an understatement. the beef medallion i thought was a bit tough...but do go back for the veal, finely displayed and tender. The array of dessert was also very modest, small bites and savories to cater particular palates , small shots of tiramisu, a jelly strawberry and sour apple emulsion, fat thumb sized chocolate eclairs, and miniature pear crumbles (i had 2!) . Waiters were not shy to fill up our glasses with ice water, which to me is a telling sign of extra concern, the extra mile. It is a good old place The Condrad , a little out of the city buzz but thanks to the meticulous timed traffic lights and accesiible public transport Singapore has provided getting there was a piece of cake. MRTs are a few paces away, do study the bus routes but keep in mind getting a cab is probably only just a few $s more..only. i did miss out on the colorful vegetable ratatouille and wished for more fresh seafood food Japanese style BUT they had fresh mussels, REAL crab meat , seared tuna, fresh fresh salmon sliced bites with wasabi bubbles sprinkled on top and elegantly displayed a few other raw seafood choices. Dress smart casual, you will blend in. its an apropriate spot for lunch meetings and if you turn the corner low lazy tables and chairs are avaible for the regulars
4
Always a pleasure to go here whether it be for breakfast, buffet lunch, dinner or for that 2am Can't sleep Jet Lag meal you need to have.......Service superb, and food quality superb as well.Variety could be added to dinner menu though and the wine-list needs updatingBut always worth a visit - especially love their Caesar Salads and Nasi Goreng....!Had pretty much all of the menu - nothing bad at all
3
We have had breakfast here 6 times and have found that the service is a bit hit and miss. We have asked for another cup of coffee and never received it, same with juice. The staff also hassle you quite a bit about the breakfast finishing (which is quite early on a week day). The buffet selection is OK but for a hotel of this standard and cost in Asia, I think it should be possible to get soy milk!! I asked and was told ''no we don't have it''
5
This place has everything from club sandwich to burger to tranditional Singaporean food through to a buffet. It is the perfect restaurant for jet lag and Asia when your body clock is all out. As usual attentive service and great food with the Conrad. Very highly recommend for any trip to Singapore
3
The seating was comfortable; food was good; but everything was very expensive, which was not a surprise - hotel restaurant. If you are budge-minded traveler, you can easily get very good food across the street for a lot less.
5
The spread was amazing - so many choices .. breads, cereals, egg bar, waffle bar, fresh juice stand (you choose the fruit and they squeeze it), meats, starches, etc etc etc. Also, the gelato was great!
5
Buffet breakfast has amazing spread (Chinese, American, European, Japanese, Indian favors). Temptation is too great; ate too much.
2
Loved breakfast !
Dinner chefs said a meal was gluten free - it wasn't! After my partner got ill, I double checked with a very helpful and intelligent staff member and found out the meal had contained gluten. Ruined our holiday!
4
We had a very good time celebrating a friends birthday and had three children with us who were very welcome. Superb food, especially the beef and ham joints. Rounded of by the children being given Chinese New Year Oscar Bears,
5
Don't miss eating here if you love breakfast. Wide variety of American foods as well as Asian delights. Ice Cream/Sorbet is included with the breakfast bar.
3
Food is good but it is always so overcrowed that the noise level feels like on train station ( breakfast time)
4
I only had breakfast here but I was impressed with it. Great selection and quality of food, not cheap. Staff are friendly, helpful and efficient.
5
I've been going to Oscar's since 1999. I was first impressed with the standard of service and quality of food. I'm happy to say none of the above has changed.The staff are vey well trained which is a testament to the management's dedication to keeping their customers happy and coming back.It's great for business, family and friends - all occasions
5
Stayed at the hotel so was persuaded to try the restaurant and we were not disappointed. Salad bars, roasts, sushi, chinese, thai, a wok station, oysters, crab. You name it they had it so if you are faddy then you will find something or if you are not sure about certain foods here is the opportunity to try as you can help yourself to the buffet or go a-la-carte
5
Love the breakfast and the soup and salad buffet during dinner!!!!
(just dont try indian option there.. just abt average.. :) )
3
Oscars isn't cheap. So I was surprised when the meat didn't taste all that great, I ordered the mixed grill. Of course I had this way back in 2010... so I hope things are better now...
5
We chose the a la carte menu but they serve buffets as well. Try to get a table by the window or outside perhaps to get more privacy.
5
I had dinner here twice on this trip. The second time I brought the clients with me. Great food Buffet style!
5
A blend of eastern and western foods, excellent european faire, one of the best buffets I have been to (looks and feels like the buffet at the Paris in Vegas).
4
Loved the variety of the buffet ... You could want for nothing with the selection! High-quality food and very good.
5
not much to say, just that I had one of the best steaks ever there
5
A lavish wide spread of regional and international menu.
5
The breakfast buffet was excellent. There was a lot of variety and the food was constantly being topped up. They had an egg station and one I hadn't seen before - a waffle station. The chef was making fresh waffles and you had a selection of toppings including ice cream. Service was very fast when you enter the restaurant and we didn't wait for tea or coffee. They had filled these by the time we sat down with our first plate of food. Staff were all very friendly and removed dirty plates quickly.
4
Tried the breakfast buffet, huge variety, fresh and pipping hot. N there's homemade ice cream which is fantastic! Sausages, ham, cheese, eggs, Japanese miso soup with rice, Chinese food, freshly squeezed juice, simply wonderful!Will definitely have the breakfast again, ambience wise, if I'm in a good mood that morning, I'll think that it's bustling with life n busy, else, noisy and crowded. Not that it's their fault, with the good food, who doesn't want to visit
