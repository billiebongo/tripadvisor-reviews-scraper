The food was of poor quality. There are many other places which have much better food for better value.
3
The food selection was average at best. There wasnt much variety. Service wise, the waiters were attentive in attending to our requests.
5
Absolutely everything is here in a big, airy room. Good service. Hot foods, cold foods, European foods, Western foods, Asian foods. Can't go wrong.
5
Fantastic breakfast selection, prompt courteous service. Buffet style but also cooked to order eggs and other items.
4
Very extensive range of European food offered mixed with Asian food. Highly recommended for those who wants to try variety of European food.
3
Less Variety of food, especially seafood. No crab, no lobster. Came for the 1-for-1 promotion, if given the original price, I wouldn't come
5
I had breakfast here two mornings. There was so much on the buffet I didn't even notice one part of it until the second day. Everything you could possibly want in a deluxe buffet, and more.
5
Good variety of food but choice of cold dessert is very limited. Opening hour kinda late. 1230pm for lunch.

Come upon knowimg Cafe Swiss by Swissotel the stamford is having 50% for tjeir dinner buffet via OCBC credit card payment. So me and my colleague have not eaten there before wanted to give a try after looking at what they offered on their their menu in their offical website. The food listed looks worthy for the 50%. But when we were there, Food variety was average, in fact lesser than what most hotel buffets offer. On their website, it stated snow crabs but when we got there. There isnt any on the buffet spread. When i asked the staff, none could give me an answer till they asked manager. The manager mentioned bcos mamy customers have complainted that the snow crab was not fresh and not of good quality. If the restaurant is not offering the food on the buffet, why is the food still stated on their menu in their website? Isnt that scamming of customers? Mkjng people book and dine and realise what it is stated is not what u get. The slipper lobster was pathetic, smaller than my palm, not tasty at all. Desserts are limited and do not look appetizing at all. We were served one round of water as we sat down, the rest was self service because we could not get any waiter to serve us. They seemed very enthusiastic to clean up the tables.For the food and service, not recommended.Price tag is way outrageous for food spread and quality. Freshness of food is questionable to say the least. Ambience is absolutely miserable and depressing. Window table has no view at all. Wanted to scoop some ice cream, took a bowl and i was nearly cut by the bowl. The bowl was chipped at the bottom. I felt uneven base and turned the bowl and was so shocked to see a chipped bowl used at a 5star hotel buffet. Imagine if a kid was the taking that bowl, he/she would prolly be cut. Only consolation was the tea served was TWG. One and only good point. I do not recommend this buffet/restaurant to anyone. Not worthy of the price i paid even after 50% discount (at almost $52nett). I rather head down to buffet town, for better variety.
2
I sure wouldn't return for their food. Thankfully I went using their 1-for-1 promo but I still had to pay full price for 1 adult and 1 child which I felt the food and varieties was not worth that price. I only have thumbs up for their butternut soup and cooked salmon
4
The buffet spread was OK with promotion price. If full price i need to consider. Staff promptly cleared your plate. The only down side for me is that it can be quite warm eating in the afternoon when the sun shines in.
5
The dinner buffet spread was good with hot stations. The serving staff was attentive and quick in clearing the used plates.
3
Replenish of food items is slow, not a great variety of seafood if its a seafood buffet. If there’s no discount, I doubt I will be back again.
5
Please keep it up, Raclette and Fondue is very good. Very difficult to find in SG already.
Staff is friendly, overall good menu, have seafood. Have good deserts, ice cream. Also some drinks such cocktails and tea/coffee included.
3
Had lunch on a Friday. Price is reasonable (with and 1-for-1 promotion), but choices of the buffet spread is fairly limited as compared to my previous visits.The best selection was the fresh salmon slices, which are fresh and soft. The beef stew is good too. However, the chicken and pork rib were over-cooked and very tough. The sushi were very dry and crumby.The staff is fairly attentive
5
The hotel is one of the best I have stayed at. All staffs I met was wonderful, especially Mrs Selvi provided a excellent & very friendly service and made me feel at home. She served a delicious tea prepared by her self and it's too good.
3
We went for a dinner buffet at Cafe Swiss and the very first thing i noticed is that the lights are too dim. Maybe the restaurant is promoting a cozy dinner or so. On the buffet table. The sushi always ran out, uneven cut were served. The stationed chefs on the food usually does not smile, that’s why it feels akward. The cooked food does not have too many choices as well, or did not seem appealing coz of the darkness (cannot see the food). Bread are nice together with the coffee.Overall, its a okay
5
I called the restaurant for a last minute reservation. 15 minutes before we reached the place. The buffet spread was excellent. They have different salads, sushi, maki, risotto, roasted pigs trotter, seafood, cheese fondue, roast beef and a lot more. The roast beef was very good. They have some malay and indian food. But mostly it would be international food. Desserts were really good. Fresh cut fruits are also available. They provide apple juice included in the buffet. The staff are very accomodating and are helpful with your requests. We would definitely be back
4
Breakfast spread's excellent. And there is freshly squeeze juice to order, although you have to make do with what they have each morning. Serves American breakfast to Asian cuisine. There's always a crowd and some queuing is necessary, but the wait will not be very long (about 2-10 min max)
5
We had our daily breakfast in the Swiss Cafe every morning. What a place to have a good breakfast to start off your busy day in Singapore. You have a great selection of all types of food from the big Americian breakfast to the Asian breakfast. One is overehelmed with the choices. I varied my breakfast each morning
2
Cleanliness is sub par. Price tag is way outrageous for food spread and quality. Freshness of food is questionable to say the least. Ambience is absolutely miserable and depressing. More incandescent lamps are needed!
4
We had a good lunch at Cafe Swiss today. Good spread of food selection from salads, seafood, meat dishes, desserts etc...
3
Buffet line was slow to top up but clearing of plates was fast. Flies hovering around the smoked salmon so I didn't dare to try.
4
Service staff were all very patient, warm and friend. Selection of food is not huge but there's interesting things like traditional swiss raclette during dinner. Ambience is cozy too. Price is not bad during 1 for 1
4
Review by Dr Sim. Nice Ambience. Quite Good Buffet though limited. Look for Credit Card Promotions then it would be worth it. Service is good. Overall enjoyed the place. Tourists can try. Regards Dr Sim
4
Took advantage of 50% discount on Mondays for up to 5 pax to have lunch here as a birthday celebration. The buffet selection was wide and service was good.
2
This is not a great buffet, the only good thing about our dining experience was the service staff, they are well trained and friendly. The buffet selection is ok, but I was disappointed by the quality of ingredients used and the very very slow replenishment of dishes - at one stage the majority of the desert counter was empty,, and for quite a while, not just for a few minutes! Our table was unstable and had chips in the wooden top. We won't go back - we left hungry!
3
Got a 50% off credit card deal on weekday lunch buffet and went with pretty low expectations because of some poor reviews I read prior to going. But it was quite good, and no problems with flies hovering nor selections that were not topped up. It was a bit warm though, because of the high ceiling and in-adequate air-conditioning. Otherwise, the selection is quite varied, most everything is quite nice, but nothing stood out, but that is probably the case with most buffets
3
Had dinner with my friends last Friday. The service were okay. However buffet selection is very limited, from main dish, side dish and dessert and the food are average. Overall the selection was disappointing in variety, even if the quality was okay. Based on past experience with other buffets, we had expected a wider choice of dishes
5
On a recent visit for a business lunch to Cafe Swiss at the Swissotel The Stamford hotel at Raffles City it was a great surprise to me to enjoy a vastly improved lunch buffet offer with a very nice "Swiss touch" offered by the chefs and service staff. Having enjoyed Cafe Swiss before I could see an impressive "re-vamping" of the food offerings which now include a tantalizingly tasty array of fresh seafood, local favorites like Laksa and a great variety of main dishes from Western to Asian staples (cooked and grilled meats, fish and vegetables in all sorts of varieties). In addition, the traditional salad and hors d'oeuvres offerings have been expanded and improved. You will now find more quality cold cuts, cheeses, salads, bread varieties and even Swiss cheese fondue tempting you before you even start to think about your choice of main dish. Finally, the dessert buffet remains a very solid offer as well - with a good choice of cakes, pastries, warm desserts and fresh fruits as well. The service is attentive and friendly, and the drinks on offer are all of high quality - with a special juice bar added for additional value. All in all, I found the lunch buffet to be a great value, and the food and drinks were of the highest quality. The ambience in the airy and light filled atrium dining room is enjoyable as well, and Cafe Swiss can easily be found and accessed via the Raffles City shopping mall entrance. A great choice for lunch, and I will certainly be back for more soon
4
Great selection. A little noisy in a large space. Friendly service and tasty food. Try the e-fu noodles and the bao!
4
Buffet spread is quite okay except the cold drinks section which only has one choice, it would be great if the patrons are given more choices for the cold drinks.
4
My sister was having a cough,a staff offered a warm drink with small bottle of honey.N i also request the same.
3
From main dish, side dish and dessert. The choice of food is very limited. So different from the picture shown. When to grand copthorne waterfront buffet , the food was really awesome.
5
Great service by staff. Staff were very attentive and helpful. Good variety of food. Good and condusive atmosphere.
4
We ate at this restaurant number of times during our visits over the years and have seen minor changes but it is still best buffet around. Darren thank you for making our juice in the morning and the hottest coffee just the way I like. Paul was very attentive and made sure to get us the ginger for the juice. We had dinner and lunch at the restaurant. Seafood buffet was great, best Laksa soup I had. Only draw back was the soup in the morning was not hot just luke warm. Do not serve it unless it's hot as it tastes better to me. I had to have it warmed up every morning of our stay. Otherwise the quality of the food was fantastic. And nothing was too much trouble for anyone. Thank you
4
The breakfast there is really good. One of the best you can find in a luxury hotel. It can be pricy for some people, but if you are staying at the Swissotel or the Fairmont, ask if the have a deal. It is definitely worth it. Please note, that if you show up after 7am, there is likely to be a line to get in. So , go in early. Try this: fresh squeezed apple, carrot, cucumber and celery juice, it is awesome
5
I loved this hotels ambiance and the way service was undertaken.I would really extend my heart felt thanks to Mr.Guna L,Vignesh and Lokesh and team who really offer the best service to us.My two week tenure was made comfortable by their service.I liked the feel of this food and beverage outlet, one of many in Raffles City, this one under SwissÃ´tel the Stamford. Situated within an atrium two stories high, we were shown to a nice comfortable table.When my sister joined me Mr.Guna helped her with breakfast menu and his service was remarkable.We were there to enjoy the asian and international breakfast, and what a selection it was. It was wise of the restaurant to spread out its dishes over a few areas so that they are not clustered together. Breads, salad and cheese were in a corner, the desserts in another, and the mains were placed around the water feature in the middle of the restaurant.I would recommended it not only for its food but also its service
4
The buffet has a nice variety of different food. The taste I still remember after a few days is the salmon, roasted celery and the sorbet ice-cream. The place was fully booked on a Saturday evening, but still all the food was replenished fast. Service was average, but I guess this depends a bit on which staff is responsible for your table
4
Surprisingly standards have gone up since a few years ago. The staples are still in the buffet: such as fondue and raclette. The local offering has improved, with laksa included. Salmon sashimi is plentiful and crab legs are included. Value of money is also good since there's a 50% discount with OCBC. I would say give it a try. I feel it's better than Asian Market which has gone halal. Though Asian Market offers local and has oysters.
4
The place can be improve by add sun-x paper on the glass to reduce the Heat!Food are not much variety.
4
Excellent buffet and caters well for non seafood eaters (me).
Beautiful leg ham today, mmm. As I was at lunch I only had a glass of nice white wine.
4
A great selection of both western and local foods both Savory and sweet. Current Amex card promotion makes the buffet very affordable
4
Awesome buffet dining at cafe Swiss with excellent services. Will visit again if there are time to visit.
4
With its cosmopolitan settings, modern styling and mouth-watering cuisine, Cafe Swiss, Swissotel Singapore is an ideal casual dining venue for dining. They specialise in Swiss-inspired European cuisine and popular Indian dishes. Congrats team Cafe Swiss for excellent and friendly service.
4
I have been staying at the Stamford for 230 years and always look forward to staring the day in this large bright buffet cafe.
3
Large café serving the Fairmont and Swissotel. Used a couple of times for breakfast and it gets very busy and chaotic. Good choices of breakfast items to suit most tastes and dozens of people moving from station to station looking for their choices
2
There was nothing Swiss about the buffet except the fondue . Previously, there were nice cheeses and roasted meats. This time, only one meagre roast was presented and the meat was tough. No strawberries for the chocolate fountain, the sushi rice texture was not well prepared. The seafood selection was also not attractive. Nothing special and you get the feeling of dire cost cutting in staff, food and even the aircon. I waited 20 mins for my check while seated and when the waiter didn't show up, I went to the counter and stood there for another 15 mins while he processed the bill. How did we reach this sad state in F&B. Otherwise, a nice setting to spend the weekend dining with families and friends. Hope that should continue to draw the crowd in service and quality improvements
4
Not a budget restaurant but server good Beef tenderloin, Capellini with pan-seared Prawns. Fondue is a must especially if you love cheese. suggest to Finished with the Chocolate Fondue to sum up the Meal.Offers a limited but good quality spread that should suit the needs of those that Enjoy Western/European Foo
3
Very tasty prawns with an unlimited supply of sashimi was my main course. Nice spread of dessert too. Warm food selections are alright, the usual. Swiss cheese and chocolate fondue. Good service, TWG tea served. It was a pleasant lunch experience. Hopefully dinner has more variety.
5
We were lucky to be there on a night when the full buffet was available at a 50% discount as we were staying at an adjacent hotel. Everything I have ever dreamed at a buffet was there. Seafood, roasts vegetables and of course desserts.
5
It is wonderful service done by Selvi and also by others too. The way of handling, dealing the customer and their response are too good. It is nice experience.
3
The food quality and variety are average. We waited a long time for replenishment. I would rather pay $20-30 more for Shangri-la or mandarin oriental.
5
I and some friends went there to have Christmas lunch together. The food was good. Their dessert was fantastic. I loved it.
4
I especially love the DIY YuSheng! I can make it just the way i like it :)
the staff are always friendly, no bad experiences as long as you stay away from the carving station, only slivers offered (makes you feel like oliver twist)
4
Cafe Swiss has a reasonably priced dinner buffet. The hot food and salads are great complimented with deserts. The only downside is the sashimi that wasn't up to the expectations. It wasn't bad, but the taste was not top-notch and the way it was cut is unusual and not appetizing
4
It was a convenient feed stop just minutes away from the Fairmont Hotel room. The international buffet also transferred the decision making from the brain to the stomach. There was a wide spread of dishes separated into three sections. I was pleased to find many seafood choices including crayfish, prawns, scallops, mussels and raw salmon. There were also two soup selections and a self-help Singaporean laska station.The carvery section had German sausages and succulent cuts of beef cooked medium rare to medium. However I was not a fan of the overcooked pork. Other attractions included the fondue and raclette. I particularly enjoyed the scraps of melted Swiss cheese uncommon in other restaurants.
4
This restaurant is one of two that serve breakfast for the Swissotel hotel guests, the other being Kopi Tiam. The breakfast selection is as varied as you could wish for in this corner of Asia, with everything from fruit, cereals, pastries, breads through to cooked foods from all corners - curries, dim sum, noodles, as well as standard western breakfasts. Many of the staff have been there for years, which is always a good sign. Can get very crowded in the mornings though
5
This place must have improved a lot in the past few years! The food is great (right temperature and taste), and the spread is reasonable. Focuses mainly on Western cuisine though. If you've been to Equinox before, the standard is comparable, although the buffet style is slightly different. The cheese here may taste a bit strong for some though. The service is really efficient. I got a cup of water within 2min of sitting down. The staff was also very attentive and cleared the tables almost instantly during the first 3/4 of the meal. This place is well-designed and has a modern and open concept. I like how it doesn't feel very constrained here. The aircon doesn't work that well though, and it may get warm near the window seat. If the dessert temperature could be maintained more precisely, this place would be perfect.

It's a tradition for us to go out for Christmas Eve dinner. We've tried several restaurants over the years but, for me, Cafe Swiss was the most fun. The fun part was having a roving Santa who walked throughout the restaurant during the dinner wishing diners Merry Christmas, passing gifts to small children and occasionally ringing his silver bell. He also managed to insert his cheerful, smiling face in one of our selfies which made us laugh when we discovered it. The other fun part was having a fairly large chorale group show up around 9:30 to serenade the restaurant with all my favorite Christmas carols. This was an especially nice touch. Besides having a lot of fun, the food served at Cafe Swiss was really good. Being Swiss, and all, of course they have several Fondues. They also had an excellent selection of roasts waiting to be freshly carved and served with customary accompaniments, such as roast veggies, gravies and even apple sauce for the ham. The seafood buffet contained a good selection of shellfish that was replenished regularly so we were never left waiting around for more goodies. The cold salad buffet was amazing and included one of the widest ranges of prepared salads and toppings I've seen around town. For me the highlight of the buffet was the raclette cheese station. This Swiss specialty involves putting a wheel of pungent raclette cheese under a special broiler until the melted cheese can be scrapped off and onto a plate of freshly boiled new potatoes. Add to this a few cornichon (miniature pickles) and sliced dry salami and you have a complete after ski dinner. One warning, when I say raclette cheese is pungent, think durian or old socks but like most smelly foods, worth the funny looks from your table mates. If you love fondue, then you should try this variation of Swiss hot cheese dishes. Yum! And as long as I am on the topic of eating smelly food, any cheese lovers will relish Cafe Swiss' Cheese selection. The night we were there they had some excellent goat cheese, Camembert and to my great surprise, Tete de Moine (Monk's head cheese). In all the years I have never seen Tete de Moine, which gets its name from the way the cheese, when shaved from the top down with a special, circular knife, resembles the shaved pate of Brother John, or Mark, etc. Again, this is a pungent cheese, so if you love Durian, you will love this stuff. If not, stick the Camembert. The only suggestion I can make is to request a window seat when making a reservation, as the view is of downtown and I think its always nice to see the city lights when dining out in town
5
I eat here a lot as I come on work trips. The breakfast is always great. Sometimes a short queue but you don't wait too long.
5
First time experience. Very cosy place. Food was very good. Alex have been very attentive & his service handling is very good as well. So we had a very good time here for dinner.
5
Came here with colleagues for an early Xmas buffet. Love the Japanese selections which has very fresh salmon sashimi. Used the Amex 1-1 promotion and it was so worth it!
4
A wide spread of food to choose. Service staff are alert and attentive. I am very impressed with their service. The dining area is clean and well designed.
4
Quality spread of seafood, cold cuts, starters and salad. Was there during Octoberfest and good range of German and Swiss food.
4
The service by the restaurant managers were the only staff in the restaurant and with exemplary service. They saw diners having difficulty having seafood and without asking offered scissors and water. Both of them were the only staff that clear plates and offere beverages to diner. With exemplary service and smiles on their faces!
3
I went there with my son. The food was average. There were cheese but without crackers. And where was the thong for taking the bread? Sashimi sauce should be labeled. No scissors to cut the crab leg. Service was poor and cutlery wasn't cleared and removed quickly (see picture
3
On Public Holidays, they would have lack of staff. Cafe opened at 1230 hrs instead of 1200 hrs. Though the buffet spread was much of various asian types, the replacement were slow. Though on Mondays, the charges were 50%, not sure there are less.Overheard next table, who had much complaint to the Staff
3
Better known for its European cuisine, than the international buffet spread, although the latter was pretty good, with a wide variety of dishes. Surprisingly, I enjoyed making my own laksa and it tasted nice. My wife enjoyed the cold seafood section very much and had many Alaskan crab legs
5
Really enjoyed a quiet Saturday night out here, we fancied a buffet and all of the 'Big names' were full so,as regular visitors to the Swisshotel restaurants, we thought we'd try this one.Given the price, the selection is great, lovely quality salmon sashimi and nigiri/maki sushi with condiments, lovely seafood, similar to the items on the seafood platter in Equinox - clams, huge very tasty crevettes, mussels, scallops, mini lobsters, again with nice condiments ( don't miss the chilli sauce to dip the prawns in).Salad bar is really good with very fresh and interesting salads, potato, mixed beans, beetroots, octopus,chicken salad- lots of salad items too and dressings. Cheese fondue with bread and veg for dipping was so tasty.Hot stations are great, crispy pork belly, beef and local items. The cheeses were more than enough and lovely selection of crackers and breads. Puddings, again were great, all delicious and more than enough selection. The restaurant was nicely full,but not rammed but there's plenty of space for everyone and no queues etc, service was excellent, my husband had the free flow Tiger beer at $20 and it was topped up all of the time. Juices were delicious and included and coffee tea. We will definitely come back -just for the prawns if nothing else. Really good buffet, I liked the setting at night time as I not so keen on very light and bright restaurants so for me night time worked better
3
I love the service and special thought for my friend's birthday. Alex has been a great host! Good if you can increase varieties of local cuisines and Chinese menu to cater to tourists and elderly folks. Which I plan to bring my elderly parents here.
5
Very good ambience especially on F1 night, however despite credit card promotion, bill still too pricey. Service standard can be better.
2
Went there for a breakfast buffet today and wasn't really impressed.They did have a decent spread but everything was a little less than impressive. Right from the English muffin to the omelette and from juice to the oriental spread.The only things that i enjoyed were their Danish which were really nice and the peppermint tea( yes, i m being sarcastic about the tea. It was TWG moroccan mint)All in all, i m not going there again
5
CafÃ© Swiss is definitely one of the best hotel breakfast buffets this is the main reasons for choosing Swissotel to stay. One is for its location and the other for its great breakfast on offer by Cafe Swiss. Food always tastes fresh with a variety of different choices, and it is worth every dollar. Service is also very speedy! The quality and range of food they offered is marvellous. The hot selections were exactly that and the selection of fruit, yoghurt, waffles, and juices, you name they got it. The wait Staff are very professional the service is excellent and very friendly and attentive, nothing was a problem. It is in a nice locale and beautiful ambience. Would highly recommend. I love it that much I was back until my duration
4
The buffet spread offered at Cafe swiss is quite different from the other buffet available at other hotels. They have more european selection comparatively, and the cheese fondue was great. Having said so, the laksa was quite nice as well. However, the dessert selection was not exciting. Also, they seemed to be understaffed on a Saturday night. Plates are not cleared very promptly though manageable. We waited quite long for the bill to come.
5
This was my first visit to the restaurant at the Swissotel in Stamford Rd Singapore. I was invited there for a business lunch and I wasn't sure about the restaurant. The restaurant occupies a large area with a huge skylight so it's bright but it also means that it's not really cold in the sense that you don't feel the air con. The effect is not unpleasant but on a hot afternoon, the sunlight can be glaring. Despite this, the buffet spread was a delight. There was a huge range from Asian food: Chinese, Indian and Malay dishes to the salad areas and the carved meats. There were two stations: one for pasta cooked to your specifications and the other a Chinese noodle station. That was nice! The buffet also offered Chinese broth as well as Western styled soup. The dessert spread was amazing and included a chocolate fountain. There was also free flow of juice and on the day I was there, it was a deliciously cool cranberry juice. With taxes I paid about S$65 per person. If you have a long lunch break and a big appetite, it's worth it.
4
The Cafe swiss has the buffet lunch and dinner everyday till saturday. Almost every 2 or 3 month there is a theme for the lunch or dinner. This time was all about cheese. There is a good variety of appertizers, main course and ofcourse desserts. The waiters are quite attentive but a bit slow in cleaning up the tables. The grill food was about grilled pork and beef. The beef was well prepared but a bit tasteless. But the vegetables could be a good combination. The desserts were the best with a very well prepared variety. Overal was a good experience
4
I have been to the restaurant a couple of times over the past years. But each experience always provides something new for me. I went to Cafe Swiss recently with my family, and this time round, besides what I was used to taking in the past (Japanese sushi, seafood, European dishes), there is also an Asian selection available. For instance, you can make your own laksa, take some curry or even have fried rice.The dishes were, as usual, fantastic. The only one thing I don't really fancy is too much cheese. Don't get me wrong. I love cheese. But too much may not be a good thing altogether.I think Cafe Swiss also goes out of its way to make sure that diners have a pleasant experience. The dishes are cleared regularly, and the waiters do try to ensure that guests are distributed throughout the restaurant, so that groups are not seated near to each other (and create unnecessary loud conversations for everyone around).All in, I will love to visit Cafe Swiss again anytime
4
Was there for lunch buffet. There service level were great, creating that wonderful dining experience. They top up your ice water very frequently without asking and clearing your used plates fast. The buffet spread is consider good but short of fresh oyster. They have great freshly baked breads and simply love the desert session. Must try their onion soup. Oh yes... FREE flow of cranberry juice too
5
Definitely one of the best hotel breakfast buffets. Food always tastes fresh with a variety of different choices. One of the main reasons for choosing Swissotel to stay at is the great breakfast offered by Cafe Swiss. Service is also very quick with very good coffee! My kids especially enjoy the mini muffins and flapjacks with Nutella :)
5
Dined here every day for seven weeks and the food and staff were professional and really friendly. The freshly made juice to order and omelette station are highly recommended.
4
There is a 1-for-1 credit card deal till end of April 2016. There is a wide variety of food and it is value for money with the credit card promotion. A good place to consider when gathering with your friends.
3
Good quality food. From western to eastern cusine. The speed of the Lobster replenishment was slow. For a buffet costing $73++, I expected faster replenishment. And there were no Oysters to be found. There were prawns, bivalves and clams and crayfish too.
3
I am used to stay in Swissôtel when in Singapore. I am usually have breakfast buffet here which is really excellent with a variety of western and asian tastes. I also tried the dinner buffet which honestly is not like in other high levels hotel in Singapore. Japanese section is very limited and the Asian dishes are not special as we can expect. Seafood is good and Dessert section very tasty even if quite limited
1
Coagulated dumplings, cold main dishes but of course the eggs prepared by the chef are hot and delicious. Food safety needed here as the staff seem to only focus on seating customers and serving beverages and not on the food which has been put out on the buffet. However, staff are very polite and helpful.
5
Others restaurant called to reconfirm. I was shocked when I called on 18/2 was told no booking under my name. After another attempt, finally found my booking (must mentioned book under chope not under my name/ contact number.Overall the foods, the service good. The price is good. Must go back.
2
Had our annual family gathering lunch and the best thing was being around with our folks. The food was edible but really not value for money, and most of all, there's really nothing Swiss about this restaurant.The buffet spread tried to cover both Asian and European cuisine, but, unfortunately neither cuisine was well represented nor well cooked. The dessert spread was a complete shame with dry cakes and tasteless mousse.The worst was the cheese that really didn't do any justice to Switzerland. The Gruyère was acceptable but the Appenzell tasted like a low quality Gouda and didn't taste anywhere near an Appenzell.Overall we did of course enjoy the companionship and family gathering but the food was unfortunately a let down
5
We went for a dinner buffet in Cafe Swiss and I must say food is very delicious for a reasonable price. I love the wide range of seafood options and also the variety of desserts. Definitely will come back for this one! You guys must try when u visit Singapore.
3
I intended to try the breakfast of Cafe Swiss, but I was arranged to be sit in Kopi Tiam.The breakfast price was the same, but environment and food selection was different. Especially, the highlighted fresh juice was only available in Cafe Swiss. The price of breakfast was not low, but quality and selection was just average. So, quite disappointed
4
The price is reasonable and service is good. The lunch time is pretty short (2 hrs) for a weekday. Food spread is okay but desserts can be better with more variety. Nice view if seated near the windows but can be pretty warm in the afternoon.
4
Buffet is good and in a wonderful setting. Super value for money with the one for one deal. Recommended.
4
Hope to get more special foods (international) in Cafe Swiss. And more romantic environment (more quite).
3
The hotel should improve on the spread of buffet. Quality is acceptable. But due to shortage of wait staff, the service can be improved too
3
Buffet is adequate, nothing special. Have nothing bad or good to say really. Service - they really need to brush up on service. You can hardly find a waiter to ask for help.
4
We always visit CafÃ© Swiss whilst staying at Swissotel Stamfordon our frequent visits to Singapore where we always breakfast. This is a buffet style affair with a huge range of dishes available, to suit pretty well all tastes I would imagine. The traditional English breakfast style is readily available in a large range, and the organisation is such that being obliged to wait would be a rare event indeed. The space is large and airy and the whole experience makes for a good start to the day

I loved the place and the food! The only problem is we ate much more than we should! Everything I tried was delicious! Salads, sushis, swiss cheese fondue, grilled vegetables, beef cheek in a dark sauce! And the dessert was awsome! I had fruits with chocolate sauce! I also tried chocolate mousse cake which was very good! I want to go back again very soon

With mini/slipper lobsters as cold dish and a wide spread of good, dinner @ Cafe Swiss was a decent meal for a little get together. Variety of different international delicacies can be included to make the price more worth it. Range of sashimi can be extended too

Good selection of food on offer, great value if you are staying at the Stamford hotel as you can get 50% discount.Their breakfast buffet is great too, lots of choice and the food is always fresh as there's a high turnover which may result in waiting for a table during busier periods but breakfast is served 11 am, good news for late risers

I had the breakfast here as part of my package at The Stamford. The quality and range of food they offered was tremendous. The hot selections were exactly that and the selection of fruit, yoghurt,waffles, juices, you name it was beautiful. The wait staff were on the ball, and tea or coffee was on your table very quickly. It is in a nice location and tables were spread enough to have your own space. I only had breakfast here and it was delicious

As rarely see this buffet restaurant on any top buffets in SG, I thought this is just one of the average buffet places (i've been to quite a few) but I was wrong. I dont like chaotic, unorganized buffet places so the cozy ambience of this restaurant is really a plus point for me. Staff are friendly and food although not much of a selection but really good. Not my top choice of being the best in SG but I can say one of the best. Will definietly go back

Open spacious area, enjoed breakfast here 2 days...

Visited this restaurant recently for Mother's Day. There were some credit cards promotion hence we chose this restaurant. The theme for the buffet is western. Food wise, expect the usual hotel style buffet line. As this is western style, the food on choosing is all western. You can't find local or Asian cuisine (I.e prata or laksa). Not even pizzas. But, being buffet, how can there be without Japanese sushi and salmon sashimi? That's the only inconsistency with the theme. Taste and quality wise, it is not bad. They could have more chefs or server at the roasted section. 1 chef working over freshly cooked pastas, cutting and serving of roasted meats is asking too much from him. Service wise, it is a thumbs up. They answer to most request such as dining sets for young children and filling up the ice water promptly. Clearing of used plates is pretty fast too. For a Friday dinner, it is quite packed. So do remember to make reservations before coming down!

Food variety was average, in fact lesser than what most hotel buffets offer. Desserts are limited and do not look appetizing. We were served one round of water as we sat down, the rest was self service because we could not get any waiter to serve us. They seemed very enthusiastic to clean up the tables as it was close to 2:30, end of lunch buffet. They even came to our table (finally) at 225 to asked if we have finished so that they could clean up!! That was the first and last time they asked if we wanted more water. For the food and service, not recommended

Am dining with my family now in Cafe Swiss and I'm very concerned about the food safety of this place.All the hot food are luke warm and the desserts are barely cold.The buffet lightings are super glaring and I pity the chef that's standing behind the counter. Can see the chef is struggling when he's cutting the ham for the guest.I'm disappointed at such food and safety hazard in such an established hotel

Made a reservation online for lunch on Sunday. Reached the restaurant on time, see that it's not open for lunch and dinner on Sunday. How can this happen? This is not some restaurant in a shopping mall, it's a hotel restaurant, and a renowned hotel at that. Is there an option to rate zero? Horrible

I made a family dinner reservation on 1st January. I even received the email confirmation. We were utterly disappointed to arrive at the restaurant to find it closed. If the restaurant was to close for the night, I do not understand why it was not indicated as I made the reservation on the Swissotel website itself.What a horrible new year eve experience

We used some membership voucher hence the price was much more reasonable.Food : we ordered a variety of dinner entrees from burger to pan seared cod as well as risotto style spelt. I think all the dishes were were well executed and the portion was good as well. nothing fantastic - presentation was commendable. Price : acceptable for the quality of the foodservice : acceptable and prompt. we were served some cold bread and butter. Not very sure if they are supposed to be cold hence we asked. The server politely asked if we would like them warmed up, hence I am a bit puzzled.Very strict about seating from 630PM onward. To me, very good service would be to welcome any guest in and let them settle down on the seat and browse thru menu as long as they are not overly early. But I do understand that sometimes this are "policy" by bigger establishment which has much less flexibility. Probably would not return if I have to pay full price for a dinner like this

came here with parents for Christmas Buffet dinner. I was very impressed. Sometimes buffet food can be a bit dry and tasteless. Not here though. Everything was cooked to perfection and was fresh and tasty. They had one of the biggest selections I've seen on a buffet. Being a trained chef, I'm fussy. So take it from me. This place is good.
5
The spread was great, and everything tasted so wonderful. From the soup to the fondue, to the sushi. It wasnt just the variety that made it awesome, it was the fact that every dish seemed to be made to perfection. It was a great and memorable lunch

Over S $43 for breakfast that was franky awful. Fresh fruit selection was minimal, and the hot breakfast (tasteless ham and watery scrambled eggs) totally unappetising. I happen to be wantng to lose wieght at the moment. Loss of appetite for breakfast certainly helped!Dim sum selection was also very small, and (at 7:30 am) very dried out.Had second breakfast (just like a good hobbit) at Singapore airport - fantastic
5
Multitude of choices,fruit cereal,healthy choices,too much to list,but excellent quality of food and service was top rated
4
Food spread wasn't too extensive but taste was pretty good! But would be even better if they change the spread during the dinner
The staffs were all very helpful in coordinating the birthday surprise I had for my boyfriend.

LOved the food and was very impressed with staff and helping get a coeliac friendly meal for my son.

Seriously good food, wide range of choices, great service and you don't need to eat for the rest of the day!! Not for every morning tho coz you'll end up big as a house. Lol. And if you're not on an expense account, a bit expensive.

I haven’t been for a while and to be honest a real disappointment.Some home favorites like lasagna really not sure where there recipe is from but there wasn’t any pasta in it or any layers of anything, but there was rosemary stalks in mine so at least there’s fresh herbs in it. The roast lamb was just raw, allot of people I saw asking for the lamb to be re cooked I am sure i heard it baa a couple of times. Really a little disappointing and as a restaurant if you say your opening at 6.30 you sound open at 6.30 and not 6.35.I guess this is 4-5 star hotel and that should reflect in the restaurants in my opinion
1
OMG! This is by far the worst buffet experience ever for everything! Dont be deceived by 1 for 1 promo, the layout, the spread of food, desserts. Because everything sucks big time! Tried oysters and it wasnt very fresh! Salmon sashimi fishy. Roast beef tasteless and chewy. Rosti taste fake. Poor selection of fruits with only orange and green apples. Bland fried rice. Pork rib not nice. Lasagne fail. Lobster bisque not hot. Service so poor and so slow. Centralised aircon can hardly feel. Should have gone skinny pizza or prego or wooloomooloo to be safe

Forget freshly squeezed (the staff described them as "processed") juices, exotic yogurts or cereals etc , but you get decent fare with Western, Chinese and Indian options. There are a good number of staff who are able to converse (and comprehend) well, so your requests will be met (this cannot be taken for granted, as in many other hotels, staff may be foreign and may not understand what you say). Par for course for a 4 star hotel restaurant
1
We decided to have good old fish and chips, well it was so dry and the batter was thick and the fish was cooked in old oil which makes the batter very brown. The waiters were ordinary. The meal was $40 each and the wine about $80 which you would imagine the food should be okay, thank goodness the wine was nice, at that price for a bottle of chardonnay it needs to be

Staying at The Swissotel Stamford or Fairmont Hotel, two breakfast buffet breakfast venue options are available - the Prego (attached to the Fairmont) and the Cafe Swiss. Whilst food choices and service levels are on par and excellent, the Prego is slightly a little more upmarket. Both are recommended. The Cafe Swiss, does however, enjoy a better outlook being located above street level

Cafe Swiss located in Swissotel/Raffles Shopping Centre serves decent international buffet lunch. The restaurant uses natural lighting from its overhead glass roof thus it can get pretty warm on a hot day. Though the food selection isn't much but it serves slightly better quality of food. Just because the restaurant is located in town area and cost slightly higher than other buffet restaurants, I would personally think twice about going there to dine again. I would rather go to places with wider spread at cheaper price. Read more on http://nkikichua.blogspot.sg/2014/05/cafe-swiss-swissotel-singapore.htm

The cafe is warm. Seem the Air-conditioning system is not working properly. Service level need to improve, esp. In refilling of water. Overall satisfactory.

Went there the other day with my family and had a lovely lunch and a bottle of pink champagne. The DBS 1-for-1 deal is great as well and makes the place excellent value for money!
Highly recommend it!

Very good selection, tasty carving and pastA station. Friendly service from service staff. Only the air con make the restaurant warm.

Had breakfast here the morning after our Tiffin Room at Raffles breakfast, there is no comparison in quality. Being only c S$10 cheaper than Raffles we were disappointed to find that apart from omelettes nothing is cooked to order. The choice of food is wide and pretty good quality, but that lack of freshly cooked food is disappointing.Cafe Swiss is too expensive for what it offers, especially vs the far superior and nicer surrounding of Raffles.Finally a note about the design. Not sure who had the clever idea of designing a 4 story high glass box on the side of a hotel in a country with almost endless hot stifling weather, but let me tell you, it is far too hot in there! My advice: go to raffles, it is only over the road

The Cafe Swiss is an elegantly, soothingly-darkly lit restaurant that is aptly described as its counterpart outlet in Swissotel Tallinn as “a modern restaurant with an inviting aura of contemporary elegance, warmth and a breath or inspirational charm”.The quietly polite waiter escorted us to our reserved table after checking with us if we would like buffet or ala carte dinner; we opted for the latter, setteld in, and placed our orders.Amelia* had the Sole Fish Fillet – creamily baked to tender perfection, bringing out the freshness of the sweet-fleshed fish. The flavours of this healthy dish was jazzed up with fine sprinkles of herbs / spices and are served alongside sweet cherry tomatoes, tiny chunks of baked potatoes and asparagus. She delighted in the colorful arrangement of this dish as well as the tastiness of it.I had the Crispy Pork Knuckle served in a pan, surrounded by German potato salad, radish chunks and whole-grain mustard. It was a very hearty dish, one eaten best over drinks – I loved the crispiness of the skin of course, as unhealthy as it probably was. The meat within was firm but not hard, and while rather bland, the texture was great when chewed along with the crisps of its skin. The mustard grains and chunks of radish and potatoes were delicious as well, but too much to take in overall; it was a rather large portion, which is good news for the big eaters.For more detailed information and photos, do visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2013/12/dinner-at-cafe-swiss-swissotel.htm

This place is getting worst. I don’t think I will ever come back here again. I didn’t really enjoyed my previous visits here, but I thought of just giving it a chance to see if there are improvements since I am around the area. Bad mistake. For SGD 75-80++ per head, this place is definitely not value for money. Food was very average with limited choices / variety. Example – Japanese selection consist of salmon and 2-3 nigiri sushi. The local dishes was bad. The chicken meat cooked with spicy sauce was hard and the fish cooked with santan was equally horrible. Don’t get me started on the rest. I didn’t try the salads or the spaghetti (cook it yourself) with 2 sauce choices. Steam prawns was not fresh. Didn’t even bother to try the oysters. The only highlight of this buffet is the cheese fondue. This was pretty interesting and sinfully good. Just dip bread, or sausages or small pieces of meat in to the different cheese fondue. I think there were 6 choices. My favorite was the one with bacon bits. Will I ever come back here again? No. If you think this review is helpful, please click on the helpful button. Thank you :

Variety of food not a lot but quality not bad, love the pasta that the chef cooks on the spot as well as the potato dishes. I think that the 1-for-1 DBS card deal makes it value for money. The staff are very polite and clear empty plates fast. Recommend to choose a seat in the shadow during lunch time due to the semi-transparent roof.

My family had a nice and delicious buffet dinner at Swiss Cafe on 2nd floor of Swissotel Stamford Hotel in the shopping area on 22 Feb 2014. Before you enter restaurant, children will be amazed to see a lifelike full size cow at entrance. Good for photo and to entertain children. We were shown to a table near to the back with transparent glass panels up to roof. So we could see the rooms of Swissotel Stamford stretching upwards while on other side, we could see Suntec City, Padang and buildings in the Marina Bay area. There is wide spread of fresh food - sushi, salmons and tuna fillets, fresh oysters, la la (shellfish similiar to cram) and steam prawns which were refilled very fast. Cooked food include hams, bacon, sambal prawns, Rendang muttons, fish fillets in several stype, bbq pork, beef, potato, several type of soups etc... Vegetarian/salad counters was quite extensive with many selections to mix and fill. Desert corner was stacked with cakes, chocolates, fruits and ice creams etc... Waiters and waitress were very attentive to refill drinks and clear used plates fast. Service was good. We had a good and filling dinner from 7 - 9 pm. Food were nicely cooked and delicious. All of us enjoyed the dinner. We will be going back again soon. It was special occasion for me and my wife because it was our 35th wedding aniversary. Also my daughter's boy friend proposed to her after the dinner

Cafe Swiss has buffet breakfast. It is open and airy with huge windows allowing natural sunlight to come in. Nice atomsphere to start your day.The buffet has a wide variety to choose from. The staff are warm, friendly and courteous. I was staying at the hotel and requested them to provide vegeterian options for the breakfast. To my surprise the Head Chef provided me a rotating Indian veg, breakfast everyday of my stay...like poori bhaji, veg cutlets, idli, dosa, sambhar, chutney, aloo vada, upma, kandha powha, etc etc..

Superb range and quality. Lovely ambience and good service. Barista coffee would make this perfect. Great to see the egg chef and the Indian and Asian Buffet counters as well. Very nicely thought through by people who know what they are doing and are passionate about it
