Exciting, innovative and flavourful dishes for Winter Menu! Truly well deserved rating at Michelin. Staff are very accomodative as well. Highly recommended!
5
I enjoy visiting restaurants that offer a tasting menu, and Meta was one of the recommendations that popped up. The "Winter" menu certainly did not disappoint in both flavour and presentation. Truly enjoyed every course in the meal.
4
Great preparations. Very delicate dishes. The only thing we didn‚Äôt like as much was the second tray of deserts. Too sweet.
5
Went here with a bunch of colleagues for dinner and drinks. Interesting menu, great service and tantalizing desserts. Highly recommend the tenderloin - cooked to perfection and melted in my mouth~
5
Great experience. Food was innovative and delicious.Staff were courteous helpful and attentive. Deserves the Michelin rating and more.

We had gone there for the 3 course set lunch and ordered different items to share. Would have preferred table seating having done a reservation but the restaurant seemed to be full even for a weekday lunch. The whole experience was wonderful and the 'Happy Birthday' tofu cheesecake was a nice surprise and very delicious. Apart from the set lunch, we ended up tasting 5 other items which were all good. Winter Citrus was one of the best desserts I have ever had. Special mentions also to the strawberry tartlets, scallop chawanmunshi, butternut squash, tasmanian ocean trout and duck breast. The garlic macarons (unique) and spiced snowball (melody of spices) to finish the meal was a delightful touch. Alll-in-all very good value for money and more importantly amazing food

This restaurant in Singapore's Chinatown is distinctly European in flavor, offering a set meal of extraordinary imagination and deliciousness. Thoroughly modern in appearance, with the well-staffed kitchen in open view behind the bar, every one of its five courses and numerous amuse bouche was a delight -- and fully accommodated my need to eat gluten free. Prices are what you might expect from its Michelin rating, but the value was certainly there

Totally awesome meal from beginning to end. My buddies and I had the 7 course Winter menu and each dish was fantastic in its own right .Interesting combination of Asian-inspired food with a modern twist. Its been while since we had a well executed Michelin-worthy star meal in SG as far as I remembered as the only ones that are worth for their star are in overseas but Meta proved us wrong. Well done. Will definitely be back here again

We had a Alsace wine dinner featuring Riesling and Gew√ºrztraminer. The match so well with Chef Sun's fusion cuisine. The oyster, dripped with sauce from ginger, chilli and chive, match perfectly with the slightly sweet 2012 Zusslin Gew√ºrztraminer. The other highlight features the succulent duck breast pair with 1985 & 1995 Seppi Landmann Riesling; awesome! Certainly one of the best restaurant in town

I took my mom here to treat her to a very special meal. And it WAS special - amazing tastes, fun to watch it being prepared, great service and they were surprisingly generous with the amount of wine you got when you ordered by the glass. I won't go through the menu in detail, let yourself be surprised, but some courses were absolutely sensational. The one thing that I would advise is to offer at least a few seats that are a bit more comfortable for the elderly. This place is designed to look hip and cool, but my mom's back hurt a bit after 2.5 hours on a rather flimsy bar stool. Remember that the older generation often has a lot of money to spend, guys! Make sure you attract them as customers too
5
The food was outstanding. Perfect for me who likes absolutely delicious food in smaller portions. It was beautiful to look at and creative and delicious to eat. I was only in Singapore for three days but went there two days in a row for lunch.
5
Went for the 3 course lunch menu (SG$52++) and each and every dish was exceptionally done. You can see & taste the creativity of the chefs right from the "pre-lunch" snacks.
5
Wow this place was fabulous! The menu was very creative and the flavors were outstanding ! The wine paired nicely and best of all the price was great for the quality and quantity! Will defiantly return and recommend!
5
The Winter menu was just excellent, inventive and so tasty !!
The staff is very professional and friendly. A very pleasant time.

Best restaurant in singaporeüòª
The food that i love the most was the irish oyster
Ive never have eaten Fresh oyster in singapore ever since ive moved to singapore 4 years ago
5
A really lovely experience. The area was small but not intrusively so. The staff amazing. And the food was very tasty. I loved the idea of using korean sauce for the optional oysters. A very refreshing change to tabasco sauce
5
Came here for a d√Æner along with my friends . We visited a few restaurant rated by the guide michelin. I would say this restaurant is very unique because of the Int√©rieur and flavors. Chair was high but comfortable for me . The petite amusement from the start was delicious , foie gras et strawberry ? Never seen but genius. I had a pan seared fish with some pepper soup that i enjoyed . And the best duck I had in all my life , the croustillant of skin that was cook √° point. Super taste and cuisson . Dessert the betterave I enjoyed very much , very balance , good acidit√© and taste but carrot maybe too strong and heavy after long meal for me . Sit at the bar , good experience watching the cuisiniers preparation.  ! Will be back soon .

What a wonderful surprise this place was. The food is truly amazing. The ocean trout is one of the finest dishes we‚Äôve ever had anywhere in the world. The set starts off with three ‚Äúsnacks‚Äù as they call them which are not on the menu. Then started the winter menu. The presentation is fantastic, but oh my it is the taste. The food makes you go ‚Äúwow.‚ÄùThe wine pairing is excellent and the volume given is very generous. This is easily in the top few restaurants in Singapore and is a world-class dining experience. The decor is funky and modern. All high chairs and most overlooking the preparation and plating. Thank you chef for a memorable experience. One we will repeat regularly.

My partner and I spend a lot of time trying new places to eat, but Meta was a particularly memorable meal - highly recommended for anyone who is serious about great food and a meal put together with thought and care - the place is special without needing excessive fanfare and the gastronomy is thoughtful, considered and at times almost understated - no smear or foam is superfluousWhat stood out most was not the individual dishes - which were good and deserving of their Michelin star in terms of flavours, ingredients and presentation, but the structure of the meal as a whole.The narrative arc from dish-to-dish played out so well, the progression of flavours and textures from one to the next was so deftly considered that the overall rhythm and impression of the thing was even greater than the sum of some fantastic individual dishes.Likewise the matched wine choices may have erred a little on the conservative side individually, but they worked as a group and a progression and served to showcase the food rather than distract with something too attention seeking or fussy in the glassWe never waited too long nor did any dish come to fast, which is difficult as we were those 'talk-y' guests whose meal-pace varies and demands a careful eye. Sitting at the bar, we could watch the prep, see what was coming out and talk to the 'back of house' team who were in fact centre stage. After our curiosity was piqued by a substitute octopus dish going out for another table instead of our oxtail pasta main (which was incredible, paired with a muscular, but not too fruit-laden southern Italian red) the chef even brought us one alongside our ragu to try. Done without excessive flourish, this understated, personal touch sums up what we loved so much about MetaAside from the fantastic food, it's this attention to the overall experience and the personal service which means, though there are a lot of other places out there to try, Meta will be somewhere to which we retur

Decided to have my husband birthday celebration at meta and we always wanted a personal low touch celebration. I had the spring menu earlier this year snd my husband liked the autumn menu so we decided to return for the winter menu. We went with the 7 course dinner and off to a great start, we were wowed by the three delicious beautifully plated bite sized snacks. I loved the scallops and fish dishes while my husband loved the duck breast main dish. As we finished our main dishes, restaurant brought a surprised tofu cheesecake with a candle beautifully plated for my husband. It was simple... greeted by one of the staff at our table and very low touch the way we liked it. This winter menu has great desserts, better than the spring menu as far as i can remember... impressed with the evolutionary dessert creations and very well blended to my liking. Only bummer for me is they do not have much wine selection but the cocktail i had was very refreshing. We really enjoyed our night... i am looking forward to see his next new creation and will return to try it next season!

Favourite outstanding restaurant 2017. Every single dish was delicious and a burst of flavours. The combination of flavours are enpointe.
5
Culinary dream of French and Korean cuisine which was super delicious and a perfect blend of the two different tastes. We enjoyed every meal and enjoyed how sweetness,saltiness, sourness and umami were combined to perfection in the different courses.
4
Food was good. Except for the high chairs.... it was a good experience. Will definitely visit again in the future.
5
We had a fantastic dinner! We went to Meta to celebrate the birthday of a friend. We chose the 7 course, the food was very original and tasty, the service was excellent, I really recommend it!
5
Place was great. Food was great. Highly recommended! Oysters were great! Chef was super nice and friendly with open kitchen.
5
Booked lunch for our 13th anniversary. We aren't really the fine dining type, but I thought it'd be nice to do something different.The staff were attentive and explained the menu and all the courses in detail (thank goodness, since they were very artistically put together!). I could pick out the individual flavours was surprised at how well they worked together.Great experience. Pity we had to get back to our offices right after. :
5
my 2nd visit to this restaurant.this time had a different seasonal menu.the food was same impressive, reconfirmed my first review.I highly recommend this restaurant.the only bit which one may need to bear was the seating, they had all high chairs, which might not be comfortable for some people.and if you were on the counter, servers might serve or collect finished dish from behind, not quite the usual way and a bit annoying sometimes
5
Came here for a nice meal with my girlfriend as it was recommended by a friend. We went on a Monday night and the place was crowded which is a good first sign. Reservations highly recommended. We went with the 5-course meal (they have a 7-course meal if you‚Äôre extra hungry). All of the dishes were delicious and had great variety from fish, to lamb, to prawn, to quail (not in that order). Although the menu is seasonal so it will change. I‚Äôm sure it will still be delicious though. The meal is expensive but I think it‚Äôs worth it if you want to treat yourself or a loved one. The service was excellent as well, staff are very attentive and polite. Definitely looking forward to coming back to try their next menu :
5
Burst into the scene with a star. My 1st time and booked for a weekday dinnerRainy day and the AC was cold. Typical of many new age restaurants these days, they have counter seats and small tables with high chairsThey have 2 set menus for dinner. We had the 5 courses, preceded by 3 amuse bouche and ended with petit fours. The food and presentation are very good but not spectacular. Portions are very small, ok for me, but not for big eater
4
Service was good. I took the 7 course menu. It came with a couple of complimentary courses. Having tried Le Cime in Osaka and just back from Taipei , having visited Raw and Mume. I found that the spectrum in terms of how the food is presented is quite similar. Well the food at Meta was not unpleasant. My wife and I felt there were a couple of really good ones. Overall it was good
5
This is my second time to Meta and it was as good as I remember. The food is incredible and I love sitting at the bar to watch them prepare the dishes. Service is prompt and friendly.
5
The food is very good and cook to perfection. The open kitchen concept enable you to see
how your food has been prepared by the chef. It is value of money.
5
Had a seven course Omakase dinner which was very well portion and beautifully curated.
Staffs are knowledgeable and well serviced.
Would recommend sitting at bar counter to see the chefs in action .
5
I almost didn't want to write a reviewbecause I don't want is to be any harder to get a reservation at this ridiculously awesome restaurant . The food is innovative but approachable .
5
Like the foods prepared for this Autumn menu. Staff are polite & knowledgeable. My friend birthday on the night, staff did prepare a small birthday for her. Thanks!
5
A small but cozy place for dating. Mouse watering snacks, few pieces of raw fish. perfect puree with main dishes.
5
Superb service. Food to die for. Not cheap but excellent value for money. I have eaten here five times in the past year and have always been thoroughly delighted with the whole experience. A fully deserved Michelin Star-personally I think that they are due another. Currently my favourite restaurant in town and there is no sign of them sitting on their laurels. If you have not tried this place yet, you really are missing out

Nestled in the Chinatown heritage area, weekday parking is easy in the afternoon. The resturant is small but young and cosy. Open kitchen with young and high energy team. Standard 3-course set lunch is $52++ We have a wonderful time here with friends and the service is attentive and non-intrusive. Food is excellent, playful, French-Asian to our liking. Great presentation not overly pretenious with the right portion size. We have a glass of Lafon Macon wine and coffee after our meal. After ++ about S$100 per head. Definitely a 'come-again'
5
We brought two friends and had the 3-course lunch, which with the pre-starters were actually 5 courses. I am not a big fan of high chairs, however, the excellent staff and food more than compensated for this. We tried the Aged Shima Aji, the Prawn salad, the quail, the Wagyu Rump Steak, and the Spanish Mackerel, and the Green Apple, all were excellent and good portion size. Highly Recommended and good value as well
3
We went as a group of 5. what we liked:the waitresses were very attentative and knowledgeable.we were able to substitute the lamb in the 5 course dinner for beef without any surcharge.the oysters and the amuse geules were magnificent.what we did not like:it's not a comfortable setting: high chairs, no cushion, tiny tables, no space.the general manager asked 2 of us to move closer to the table so that there is more space for the staff to walk. bit of a weird request in the first place was topped by the fact that a handbag, placed on an extra chair by another customer, actually caused the lack of space. but he did not want to hear that.the food was so-so with the prawn/corn combo not to my liking and none of the courses in the 5-course set-dinner memorable
5
I travel frequently to Singapore for business. I have visited Meta twice in the past 4 weeks. I love the food. Good ingredients, amazing flavour, a touch on Asian inspiration and the approach is effortlessly. They are authentic. High recommend.
5
nice ambience and great pleasing fusion of east-meets-west food. service staff were friendly and very attentive. They remembered my wife'sbirthday and presented a complimentary tofu cheese cake with yummy crust. a delight place to visit again!
5
I‚Äôve visited Meta on several occasions. The service and food is always outstanding. Excellent value for money too.
5
Very nice lunch. The food was of interest with a good mix of asian/european dishes.
Different taste and a just the good quantity of food.
We will definitely go back when they update their lunch menu.
5
My husband and I went to Meta for dinner with friends. We chose to have the 7-course dinner with wine pairing. It did not disappoint. The meals are creatively delicious with just perfect portions and the wines were good, particularly the white wine varieties. They‚Äôre also generous with the wine so you won‚Äôt be left wanting. In fact you might think at the end of the meal that you‚Äôve had too much wine if you don‚Äôt usually drink wine. Service was friendly and professional. Ambience is modern style with high tables and chairs or bar seating.Definitely worth trying or returning
4
I‚Äôve always wanted to eat at the restaurant but never had the chance to. But this time I had a double dose of it on 2 consecutive days for lunch with clients. The food were impeccably prepared and simply delicious. Although the portions were small, they did make it up with additional appetizers at the beginning. The wine could be a bit less expensive but the selection was good. Service was efficient and the staff were knowledgeable. The layout of the restaurant did not allow for the space to be maximized. And to have a business lunch there can be a bit challenging if you came in a bigger group of more than 4. But all in all a good experience
4
The food was very good. Good ingredients, well prepared. The thing is that you can only get set menus there, no "√† la carte"; hence it's a bet. The wine list could be a bit wider. Only drawback: the price of the wines by the glass are ridiculously high (min $24++ for a glass); too bad for those who like to enjoy a glass for lunch. Stil we had a goo time; thanks also to a wonderful service team

Had dinner at Meta to celebrate a friend‚Äôs belated birthday and this other friend decided on Meta as she goes pretty often. It was my first visit and I didn‚Äôt know what to expect. The facade of the restaurant is rather unassuming and it‚Äôs a bit hard to find. The inside of the restaurant and seating is rather tight. I guess it‚Äôs not a big place and can only fit limited seats.However, when it came to the food, Meta did not disappoint. The menu is a set with options of 5 or 7 course and with wine pairing. They were pretty good with replacing dishes for those who do not like meat or certain seafood etc. Had the five course and Without going into individual dishes, the food at Meta is generally pretty good. Portions are small but that‚Äôs just how fine dining places are. I ordered an extra oyster but it was minuscule so I‚Äôd suggest skipping that. Was contemplating whether three or four stars but I think it was more the company than the food that made dinner enjoyable. Enjoy the pics!

We had a team dinner at Meta on a week night. We had the five course tasting menu. Service was friendly but not overly formal. The food was interesting - Korean and Japanese influences which was different. A fun venue for an evening event. Seating wise, the seating is bar style seating which can be a bit uncomfortable.
5
Decided to visit Meta for a birthday celebration and we were pleased with the food quality and service. Staff was friendly and warm. Food presentation is pretty and in general delicious. While every course in the autumn menu is special, the most memorable dishes were the two courses of dessert. Didn‚Äôt expect green apple sorbet to pair so well with fennel, celery, and mascarpone. Equally intriguing was the walnut ice cream. Full flavoured and uniquely presented to resemble a black sand beach. Enjoyable experience on the whole. We also had a tofu cheesecake for the birthday boy. :
5
The food was innovative and refreshingly presented. Cannot find fault with it. However sitting at high tables and the noise level from a neighboring group which echoed through the restaurant robbed the pleasure derived from the food.
4
Tried it once with my family and another time with friends. Interesting take on fusion cuisine with a Korean influence, sensing kimchi in one dish.
Nice overall experience for a newly minted one Michelin star restaurant. Good experience overall.
5
Every season is unique, consistent quality and a joy to the palette. Chef Sun & team delivers the Autumn menu beautifully. Keep up the good work!
5
Amazing taste. Service was also good. Beautiful plate decorations. Snacks, salads and main dishes were well organized. Highly recommend. But may not be sufficient for big eaters.
4
Very nice fod and service kudos to this wonderful staff who made our dinner simply lovable and amazing..will be back for more.
5
The food was great, environment and atmosphere was good. Would be great if they are not so sticky to the wine corkage .
Overall, we had a great dinner. :)
5
Three course set lunch with complimentary birthday dessert. Great food and service. Take the counter seat if you want to see what goes on in the kitchen!
5
Came here for an anniversary dinner with my gf. We ordered 2 glasses of wine and the 5 course tasting menu. There were a couple of amuse dishes before the course began. Every dish was impeccable! This was my first Michelin starred restaurant experience in SG and it was great. The following ones will have a lot to live up to
5
Over the years, i have gained a lot of respect for chefs, and generated a lot of admiration for the way they go about their work, putting gastronomical gems of creation on diner's plates. Tonight, we visit Meta - a newly minted one michelin star restaurant, in the heart of the charming Bukit Pasoh district. There's not much of menu to speak of; there is the seven course, and the five course which the seven course sans two.Our seats are right in the thick of the action, with a view of the kitchen where busy chefs ply their trade. The night evening starts well, with a couple of amuse bouche, before progressing to the first course of our seven-course menu. Course by course, there is excellence in terms of execution, balance, taste, and originality. It is somewhat difficult to pick up which my favourite course. The french-inspired cuisine with Asian twist is playful, refreshing, and surprising; a clear breath of fresh air
3
I booked the restaurant 3 days in advance & requested for the degustation menu. After a good 10 mins, they informed me that the lamb ( main course) was unavailable and they had to replace with braised beef cheek. Experience was disappointing for a Michelin starred restaurant, only the amuse bouche was actually rather delicious, even the degustation which costs $110 was average.
5
The quality, creativity and service was way above my expectations of a modern fusion restaurant in Singapore. The 7 course set menu was just enough to fill m
5
Lunch was excellent. Presentations were very delicate and taste good. Fine dining without the high price tag. Dinners are higher.
4
Nice place, casual dining , having having the set lunch menu for 3 course , dining at the bar seat can look for the open kitchen that chef preparing for the dishes !
5
From the waiters, the sommelier, the sou chefs & Chef Sun, its a village working in tandem, delivering simple dishes with that unique 'meta' touch. They dont disappoint!
5
Good food, the service was personal. Actually it's great food. This is a great place for a special day.
5
This was our first time at Meta and was recommended by a colleague of mine.We tried both the 5 and 7 course meal. Every course was a surprise. Every bite we took were flavorful. The combination of flavors were a amazing. We enjoyed the meal very much and will be back for their autumn menu
4
We had the 5 course set dinner and added the Irish Oysters. They were plump and juicy. Very nicely done marinated with lemon, ginger and Gochujang. Would have preferred a fish option for the mains which was either Iberico Pork or Pigeon. The Pigeon was kind of gamey. The Octopus was excellent and so was the dessert which is "Tropical Summer". This dessert is very similr to "Snow Egg" from The Quay, Sydney. Atmosphere is a tad noisy and the seats are high stools even if you request for tables which are high tables.
5
Went there for our anniversary lunch. We loved their service to attention and the staff were trying their best to up sell their menu. Although the place was small and a little cramp it makes it feel cosy with the staffs service. The kitchen was like a show working well and smooth no loud banging or shouting. Kudos to the meta team for making this a very memorial event for my Wife and me thank you so much
5
Introduce by my friend. The restaurant ambience was fantastic. Orange lighting and a dining area near the head chef cooking your dinner right infront of us. The front of house service was also excellent. Most important is the dinner was affordable with the kind of service we received from the staffs
5
Fusion food without trying too hard to be different. Each of the dishes in the 5 and 7-course dinner sets was inventive in a different way, with fresh and layered tastes.A shout out must go to the staff - the chef and cooks were more than happy to describe each dish (we chose to sit at the bar), and the sommelier and waitstaff were also immensely friendly and helpful.The price also was ridiculously value considering Meta has recently been award a Michelin Star. Go now before it gets too popular to find a table
5
The restaurant is nice and cosy, tucked next to a temple along Keong Saik Street. Choose the bar counter dining to chat with the friendly chefs. The food is delicious, a cross between Korean and French cuisine.
5
Visited 5 Aug 2017 with the wife and got the seven course menu. Food was amazing - stop-in-your-seat good. Service was attentive without being obtrusive. Wonderful experience, wholly recommend this place.
5
Excellent food and services. Creative food presentation in a cozy ambiance. Will definitely visit again!!!
5
It was a very unique combination of the fusion food where the east meets the west. Their wine was carefully selected and served with the highest quality. Definitely will return to have celebration, be it a wedding anniversary or a simple couple time.

Celebrating my birthday with friends at Meta Restaurant. Opted for their 5-course meal @ $98 per pax with an additional Seafood Korean Pancake @ $28.The first 2 amuse-bouche set the expectations for the dinner. Well-paired, clean flavours coming through. Different types of kimchis and herb oils feature across most of the dishes to keep the palate clean and refreshed. The 3rd, mushroom-truffle-tarlet was unecessary; pandered a little too much towards the conventional.Japanese Amberjack + Yuzu, Shiso - nice and clean. Amberjack is a mild neutral fish that carries flavours well. Hard to go wrong with a yuzu-shiso combination.Beetroot + Tobiko, Burrata - excellent. The pickled beet mimicked a good balsamic vinegar, but lending a bit more texture and earthiness to the dish.Octopus + XO sauce, Sunchoke, Raddichio - once again an excellent dish. Soft, charred octopus paired with bitter raddicho. Well balanced, Could go for seconds or thirds.Seafood Korean Pancake - skip this one. There are better options elsewhere.Brittany Pigeon + Endive, carrot, cherry - they weren't joking when they spelled cherry in singular form. There was only one cherry. Well prepared pigeon but flavours came from the accompaniments and one cherry was just not enough. Great concept, just needed a little more generousity.ORIberico Pork + Doenjang, kailan, parsnip - we had 4 pax, we we could try boths mains being offered. Would recommend not choosing the pork. It was at most, ok. Sad to say, the kailan was the best part of the dish.Tropical Summer: Coconut, mango and passionfruit dome - Nice layered dessert which felt a little pseudo-Asian. The coconut mousse exterior was slightly overwhelming, but expected to be a hit with most people. For some it will be familiar, comforting flavours, for others it will be "exotic". A smart move.A very pleasant overall experience. If you do visit, do note that seating is mainly on high-chairs, and service can span from the friendly, to the cold-tinge-of-arrogance server
4
Heard of this place through a friend. We were surprised at the price given its a 1-star restaurant. $100/ pax for the degustation. We also ordered the oysters. We felt that the beetroot course was a bit underwhelming. But overall, food was tasty and nicely presented. Service was generally prompt, but they were a couple of servers who announced the dish with a 'I have said this 100x today' tone..I know, hard on them, but would be great if a bit of passion can be injected:) Definitely recommend
5
Dinner was great with the chefs tweaking some of the dishes to our liking. Love the Irish Oysters, Japanese Amberjack Scallop Carpaccio & Iberico Pork Pluma best! Crab & Seaweed Bimbimbap topped with salted egg crumbs took me to a whole new level, however I think the salted egg crumbs can either be left out since I can't really taste it, otherwise it can go a little stronger. Tropical Summer Dessert is very refreshing & the White Chocolate Tofu Cake was very good! It should be on the menu!!! Definitely better than the adventurous Barbeque Dessert. Last but not the least, Petite Four wasn't too bad, but would advise the Lavender Macaroon to be the last to go, as it has a very strong lavender lingering in our mouth
2
This is the second time that I am having dinner at Meta. My first visit was 2015 year end, the food was so much better, the ambiance and seating was much more delightful and comfortable. Now, all the dining furnitures were replaced with "High chairs and tables". It is really so uncomfortable! Furthermore, the food standard has deteriorated except for the "fresh oyster dish", compared to my previous visit. It is really a disappointment
5
My tastebuds had a whole new experience today. The chefs at Meta are in a league of their own. Every morsel was extraordinary! I understand why they earned their Michelin star and wonder if they should have received two.We had the set lunch and it was just right for a weekday. Portions were delicate, with the focus on taste. Everything was beautifully presented and all the staff, including chefs, spoke about the dish in a way that was professional yet subtle.You must try the the Summer Passion dessert! Heaven
5
The world is a big stage for this small (and young) restaurant which has recently been awarded with a Michelin star. Located in the charming streets of Keong Siak, Meta is far from being a typical French restaurant. The celebrated Korean chef serves up a cross-cultural fusion of food that permeates his Asia/Korean influence into the styles of French cuisine. For the summer menu, my partner and I were blown away by how Meta serves food that we usually will not eat. Beetroot and octopus are not high on our list of favorite food but they are served in a wide range of palatable flavors that successfully seduced our taste-buds. The excitement doesn't just stop after the food, in fact, the desserts are an art-form on its own. Tropical Summer dessert delivers the fun and joy of the season through fruits and sweets that is perfect for sunny Singapore. With such tantalizing accompaniments and an overall extraordinary dining experience, it leaves little room for doubt about being awarded a Michelin-star
4
Very interesting variety and twist to the normal food. definitely recommend it!! One of the best food that I have tried.
5
Standing applause, the crazy kids kicked it out of the park. Fushion food elevated to it's highest degree; beautiful plates of food delivered in a balanced 7 course sitting! Enjoyed every bite and will be sure to attend the next season's affair!!
5
Excellent. Best one star Michelin so far in Singapore.
Great combinations of flavors - largely French and Italian in substance with huge dollops of Japanese and Korean influences.
Will definitely come back for their autumn, winter and spring menu.
5
Thoroughly enjoyed the Summer menu at Meta! My partner and I ordered the 5-course meal (Korean fusion) and it did not disappoint! The ingredients were carefully selected for each and every dish, and they came together perfectly. I'm glad we got to try this restaurant before they got their Michelin star. Congrats to the team who made it happen
5
We had the set lunch menu, which was delicious.It's a small place, with a couple of tall tables or you can be seated at the bar to watch the chefs at work.The service is knowledgeable and professional (helpful with food intolerances) and the food was magical. The amuse bouche was such a treat, the bibimbap so good, duck was delicious and I was delighted by the tropical dessert, possibly the best dessert I have ever eaten (and I've eaten at Tippling Club and Labyrinth this week so a high bar was set!). Well balanced, fresh, gorgeous textures.I'd love to go back for the dinner degustation
5
I've been to Meta a couple of times last year, right before they received their deserved 1 Michelin Star. The best seats are the ones by the counter, where you can watch the chefs prepare each course meticulously.They have different menus according to the seasons. Do opt for the additional oysters. Fresh, zangy and amazing
4
All the dishes were good, but nothing really memorable or something I would want to show a friend or family member - except their dessert - their coconut mousse wrapping a mango ice cream with a passion fruit base, was excellent - that's a dish I would like to have again and show to some friends.The ma√Ætre d' guy was good, but there was one Filippino girl who served me a few times and it seemed she couldn't wait to be done with her job - she would explain the dish as quickly as possible and then mid walking away would coldly say "enjoy" - this happened about 3 times
5
Visited Meta Restaurant (a korean fusion). As a fan of fusion cusine, I love the way chef Sun's great combination skill of the korean dish into the "western" and innovative dish. a must try dish is the bibimbap and the Oyster. A well deserved 1 michelin star
4
Service was excellent, portions were good. I had the 5 course meal for $98++ and it came with a few other sides that were not in the menu too. 3 extra appetizers and 1 extra dessert. The style of the food was modern asian cuisine and it was very experimental and creative but the taste of the food did not blend together as harmoniously as I would have liked. I was not blown away by the food, it was asian food asian flavours in western presentation. No burst of flavours, juicy succulent meats or pleasant surprises in terms of the food

We had the 6 or 7 course dinner and we were not disappointed with any course. The presentation of food was. Rey pleading and the Flavours of the food blended so well. Chef Sun was such a pleasant person...always smiling and watching him and his team work made the experience better.
5
And amazing value at lunchtime... the two of us tried one of everything in the set lunch menu PLUS a Korean pancake. Just right, since the mains were... modestly proportioned.
Also...
TRY THE BIBIMBAP

This place is just perfect.the originality and refinement of the dishes coupled with the quality of the ingredients made it made it an absolutely fantastic experience. I keep going back to this place and i'm never disappointed!
5
This restaurant makes a gastronomic food. services, presentation and menu are perfect.
Just a bit cold if you eat at the counter.
5
Get ready to be wowed by the food both aesthetically and taste. Could have more korean influence with regards to the dishes created. However overall the food served was delightful and unforgettable.
4
I have been to Meta on 3 occasions and really enjoyed the dining experience each time. I am really happy to find that the food is still very good and innovative with consistent quality, including the pre-dinner snacks! It's a rare gem :)
5
The best French fusion in town. Spring menu was just another surprise - who would have thought korean chilly paste (go-choo-jang) could be part of dessert and made the desert place perfect!
4
The Creative Euro-Asian dishes were superb! I loved the Pigeon and the Tako (Octopus) and the Summer dessert! The Amuse Bouche and Petit Ours were equally delicious.With the Michelin 1-Star rating, expectations on the service are raised. And they could be better; how pour wine, how put down dish.The open kitchen was a hive of activity. Chefs were quite serious initially and finally more relaxed and smiling.
4
Service was very good.$128 for 7 course dinner with amuse bouche and petit fours was inexpensive.Beetroot was a miss.Grouper, pluma, coconut mango mousse and barbeque dessert all excellent.Scallop and bonito were good.For a Michelin restaurant it allows sandals and shorts, which is unusual
4
not-to-be-missed restaurant if one is going after good and contemporary cuisine in Singapore.food were excellent, creative blend of French and modern Asian kick. Don't think one can have the same thing elsewhere. Unique.a good selection of cocktail, innovative set it is. But mostly sweet ones.There were choices of 5-course or 7-course for dinner, and those were fairly-priced.The only bit was the seating, all were on high chairs.And it was a bit hot for the counter seats, and even hotter after taking in wines or cocktails.If you do not mind the high chair and the casual setup, worth trying
5
One of the best dining experiences in SG to date. Food was inventive, great flavor and texture combinations and ingredients were fresh. They kindly changed to menu for me to account for dietary requirements, and seemed to do so happily. Chefs were chatty and the whole experience was wonderful. We chose the 5 course and between that they served snacks which included some of our favorite dishes. The mushroom soft taco is mind blowing. The crab bimbimbap is the stuff dreams are made of! A Very talent kitchen and a Very special restaurant.
5
Service & Food was excellent - catered really well to my vegetarian friend.
We did a nice 4 hour dinner :)
4
I enjoyed the menu! You pick from either a 5 or 7 course. Keeping it simple for choices. The food arrived quickly, looked on point, and tasted good to boot!
5
Food and service were excellent. Perhaps could add one more choice to each of the main course and dessert.
4
Quality of food is there with a Korean influence. I had their Winter menu and coming to Spring menu there were a few repeated dishes which were a disappointment. But they were still good dishes.
5
Amazing food!!! Great staff. We absolutely loved the whole experience. We had the 5 course with matching wines. Everything was perfect. We couldn't fault the place!
4
food was good, with some interesting presentations. service staff were friendly and prompt, and the place had a nice relaxing vibe. interesting dessert that gives out smoke when placed in your mouth (probably some dry ice). was abit pricey though
4
Recently ate here with my wife. Very nice.experience with delicious food and attentive service.Closer to a 5 than a 4 rating from my standpoint.Would definitely recommend this to travelers to Singapore.It is a small restaurant offering a personal dining experience that is definitely worth the price
3
Went to Meta with a friend. We had the 10-course degustation with wine pairing.Ambience: Meta has a lovely open work area with predominantly counter seats. Love counter seats as I find it allows a casual, chilled conversations whilst feasting and watching the people at work. Lighting was set at just the right level, decor made the place feel very comfortable.Food: I loved the interesting fusion of flavors and both of us did enjoy our food though I personally found some of the dishes could be better balance in terms flavor. For example, I felt the yuzu overpowered the more subtle flavours of the oyster and hamachi, and salt level was a little high on some. But that's me - I am a person who can eat totally bland food, so do take my review with a pinch of salt ;). Totally enjoyed the additional dimension of flavor the wine pairing provided to the meal.Service: if there is an area which can be improved, it will be this. It is not bad, just that I would expect more from a place like Meta. For an open concept dining place where the chefs are in such close proximity to the diners, it would be nice to have more engagement. Service staff appears to try, but they could have been more preemptive and engaging.Overall - we really enjoyed our meal at Meta
4
Meta restaurant is a vibrant place with energy and some delicious dishes, but with some areas of improvements.My wife and I visited the restaurant for a celebration. While we were confirmed the Chef counter seats but ended up in a table beside some heavy traffic. There seemed to be some mix up in communication but we were offered no apology or empathy. We were finally offered two counter seats when other diners left, which we were almost half way of our degustation. However the area was a bit too warm due to the position of the stoves and angle of the air conditioning.The place was relatively small and the acoustics could be an issue if one was looking for some quality conversation due to the bounces of voice among the walls. It's not a place for private and romantic outing.The food was modern and innovative at a reasonable price compared to other fine dinning places. The wine list was clever without compromising quality.The experience was mixed with some beautiful food and wine let down by the other elements
5
My meal at Meta was outstanding, the food was a symphony of marriages between Korean infuences and French techniques. Unlike many other restaurants that try to do "influenced / fusion cuisine", the pairings at Meta work seamlessly & in great harmony.The chef and team are very young and it's amazing to finally see such a breathe of new talent in the very much jaded Singaporean culinary scene. I wouldn't be surprised at all to see Meta in future award rankings.Will definitely return.Maybe the only complaint is that the restaurant needs to be more wary of the air-con fan strength and direction, as for some guests at the bar, the blast of cold air is too strong
5
A place worth going if you need a wind-down on Friday night. Each plate is full of surprise and beautiful plating
5
We went there with some friends for dinner. We did the 5 course set menu with wine pairing. The food was phenomenonal! Exceptional balance of flavours and just the right amount each course.
5
My wife and I recently had dinner on a Friday evening at Meta to celebrate my wife's birthday. Reservations were made about 3 weeks in advance and given the full house on the Friday that we were there, reservations are essential.We were offered the counter or table seats; we chose the latter, although it may be worthwhile getting a counter seat if you like to observe the chefs at work and the buzz of a working kitchen.We ordered the 5-course and 7-course Spring Menu, along with 2 glasses of wine. They also offer wine pairing at an additional charge. Prior to the start of the main dishes, we were served "snacks" which comprised of a squid ink cracker topped with roe, along with a beef tartare "biscuit" and another variety of cracker. What was somewhat different from other fine dining establishments was the absence of a bread basket (but this was perfectly fine).The food arrived shortly after and the intervals for the first few courses were very well timed (notwithstanding the full house that they had that evening). The only delay we noticed was the time in between the main course - this was a Wagyu steak - and we figured that there were many tables which were due to have their main courses at the same time; the nature of serving a steak probably meant that timing was of the essence so we were happy to wait for what was to be a perfectly cooked medium steak. The dishes were generally well executed, and the integration and infusion of Asian flavours (Korean, in particular) to French-style fine dining was quite unique.The plating was excellent - the dishes were beautifully presented and you can tell the immense effort that is put in to creating an all-senses experience as you dine. Service was prompt and when the restaurant got a little too busy, the Head Chef himself would come out and help out with the serving of dishes.All in all, the meal wasn't cheap but the quality of the food was excellent. We would recommend this restaurant if you're looking for a slightly different fine dining experience
5
Beautiful to the eye, and tasty to the palate. Very creative, and beautifully executed. But of course the most important thing, the taste, is there. I usually do not enjoy fusion food as i often think it is just not well thought out, but this is not the case here. I will go back to make sure this was not a fluke
5
This is fine dining at it's best. Meta is a small restaurant so it's well worth booking in advance. Your meal will be an unhurried affair, not because service is slow, staff are very attentive, but each dish is prepared from scratch and to order. Attention to detail is impeccable, and I have to say that I was impressed with every dish, not only in terms of taste but presentation as well. It was a joy to watch the chefs dance around each other finishing dishes, this is a really well oiled kitchen and you can't go wrong with anything on the menu, which change regularly. And don't forget to enjoy some of the signature cocktails as well
4
Wedding anniversary dinner and actually one of the few that like the "bar seats' arrangement as it simply helps to be close with my partner. A fantastic place if you are big fan of food and care less about the typical fine dining table setup. Food was a treat for all the 5 senses; with excellent texture, intriguing taste profiles (mostly thanks to adding in Korean sauces?) Only small disappointment was opting for the wine pairing - wife was disappointed in the sancerre and most wines did not wow us, as they pale in comparison to the food. I would not say most wines paired well too but more of not clashing with the food. We rather pay bit more and go with less number of glasses but a more bespoke selection of better wines - could easily hit us with spirits first before we hit the wine
4
My friends took me to this little restaurant for my birthday. I have nothing to say about the food - exquisite and innovative. However, I found the table too small for a restaurant charging such prices. I had to try very hard not to elbow my friend while using a knife
4
Had team lunch and was positively surprised by additional 2 amuse-bouche. Dishes were creatively designed with interesting pairing of ingredients. Thumbs up for originality and risk taking (though not all dishes were well revived by my meal companions). Note: may not be suitable for intimate conversations as restaurant could be a little noisy but wait staff was willingly to lower music volume which helped. Worth a visit and return trip!
5
I dropped into Meta on another transit through Singapore a year after my last visit. It was still as good as it was last time. I brought my sceptical partner along this time-Korean fusion??-but after a couple of dishes, he too was convinced and we increased our order from the 5 course to the 7 course menu.
5
We arrived early for our reservation by half an hour before the establishment opened, however we were kindly invited inside & seated to escape the heat. The atmosphere was one of down-to earth service sans pretension, which usually comes with a lot of these trendy establishments. After cocktails, we ordered 5 courses with wine pairing & a complimentary main meal thanks to our EATSingapore book. From start to finish the service, food & wine were impeccable. As we walked out we bumped into friends & they asked for restaurant recommendations. We told them we had just come from a superb meal at Meta. The next day we were met with a glowing review after they also popped in for dinner!
5
Having a business discuss over lunch. At a price of $48++ per pax, it was delicious, worth every cents and filling. The best is ending our meal with a good cup of coffee!
5
This the second time at Meta and the experience is just as good as the first time. Very sure it's going to get Michelin stars one day.
4
Great atmosphere, lovely food and efficient service. Service could be warmer to elavate total experience
5
like the experimental and sophisticated taste of the food, nicely presented, with a reasonable price. friendly staff.
4
Even though both the head chef and head pastry chef were not there that night, the food and service were excellent. We had the 10-course degustation menu with drinks. Every dish was well-executed and delicious - maybe except the pork belly which was slightly dry.We felt that Meta restaurant is not that strong in their desserts (as compared to say, Whitegrass) but nonetheless we were very satisfied. Definitely worth more than one visit (
5
Went there with my gf on our usual date night! We got to know the restaurant from Amex recommendation. The food is Great, Creative and definitely served with passion, the Chef explained to us every single ingredient used in the dish(even though it's a little fast, hahah). A honourable mention is the dessert section. It is amazing, I have no idea how should I describe it. Both my gf and I were impressed and amazed by the taste and technique used for making it.One of the Chef Maira explained to us carefully on the selection of ingredients, the pairing between taste, and the layer and texture. She is very friendly and knowledgeable. We really appreciate the whole dining experience. We will definitely visit again
5
Pleasantly surprised with the experience at Meta. From the moment I stepped into the restaurant I felt welcomed. The smells from the kitchen made me immediately hungry. The choice of two menus, one 5 course and one 7 course may be limiting for some but I like surprises and being treated to something special. Delightful and informative service, excellent wines paired with the food and an entirely special experience.
3
Dissappointing and inconsistent. I had high hopes after reading the reviews, but this was poor value for quite a bit of money and we left feeling dissatisfied. We ordered the 5- and 7-course degustation dinners. The salt-and-pepper crusted grouper on the 7-course menu was the only standout of the whole night apart from the lovely light and zippy mackerel ceviche-type starter. The winter squash and even the oxtail courses lacked gusto and the roast pork belly while juicy did not have much crackly skin or anything else to take it beyond the ordinary level. The lamb loin was nicely executed but personally I don't like the weedy texture of the kale that went with it. The "White Snow" parsnip dessert in the 7-course menu was a waste of one of my courses, pretty to look at but totally bland and undistinguished. The chocolate dessert with Korean hot chilli paste had a lot more potential as cocoa and chilli always make a provocative combination, but was served too warm so we had to rush before it turned into soup. The service was efficient and friendly, but when we needed to contact the restaurant afterwards about a lost item no one picked up the phone
5
A lot of buzz around this place, with the 'M' word being tossed around a lot. I have to say, it deserves the praise. Beautiful food without being fussy. Incredible taste combinations and presentation. Sharp service in a stylish but low-key environ. For a high-end tasting menu, the price is reasonable.I would return
3
So this has been hyped and received awards so I was expecting a lot. Unfortunately it didn't meet expectations. Nothing wrong with the food but it was just ordinary. There was a 5 course or 7 course dinner and they gave a lot of snacks. So overall it was value for money. The portions were bite size and different tastes. I just can't remember any dish that I really liked and so there are just too many restaurants like this.
5
Had a great dinner here with friends
We shared the 5 course meal. Everything was made toa high standard. Food was interesting and thought provoking. Service was attentive, thoughtful and professional.
4
Superb 7 course set meal! Exquisitely prepared and creatively designed..
Place is kinda cramped though..
4
The food was delectable and very nicely plated.
However, only the Winter Menu was available so we were unable to try the signature dishes.
Would appreciate if we could be informed of the limited menu when placing our reservation :)
5
Everything was great! Food was French and Jap/Korean fusion, was really delicious and quite unique. We really enjoyed ourselves and will want to go buy to try the 10 course dinner!
5
Nice fusion food, great ambience, and very friendly staff and Chef. Not crowded at all, very pleasant dining experience.
4
Sun Kim execution was superb perfect combining Korean and Japan ingredient in each plate. Love the kaya toast with grated parmesan cheese for amuse Bouche. Capellini with Yuzu Kucho broth and seaweed was my perfect dish tonight.. Worth a visit.
4
I'll state at the outset that I'm a harsh critic and rather spoilt with good food. Everything on the menu was undoubtedly delicious, but it did not deliver the food experience I was looking for. A little bit, but not enough to justify their price tag and marketing. We went here for a late birthday celebration for me, and picked the 10-course degustation menu which was available at a discount to us, because of my Amex card. I'll say at the outset that i wouldn't have paid full price for this experience. Of the 10 courses, the most memorable were the desserts - they were bold and adventurous in their use of flavours that the other courses were not. I love Korean and jap flavors and this menu incorporates French cooking with Korean and jap flavors, but it was not as good as it could have been. I did think the oyster was great though, not just because it looks pretty. The lamb was perfectly cooked and delicious, but not adventurous enough in my opinion. Pick the 5-course menu, maybe, or only order the 10-course if you have a discount. That's my recommendation! Wine is also fairly expensive here, and we ended up paying nearly 100 dollars on top for 4 glasses of wine.
2
Heard loads of good reviews on Meta so decided to come here to try the set lunch at s$48++. The food was good but the portions were pathetic. There were 3 of us - all females - left feeling like we needed another lunch after that. This was in addition to a s$22++ pasta we topped up to share to stave off our hunger. The portion of the pasta was good enough for a baby and comprises 3 mouthfuls. Food presentation was lovely - come here for lunch only if you are planning another lunch after that. Perhaps the good reviews were for the set dinners only.
5
There were a few highlights from the evening including the amuse bouche, the mackerel (we had the set dinner) but most importantly, the food was consistently good from side dishes to desserts. The chef is able to keep the creativity alive without smothering the natural taste of the ingredients. Was it rich ? Yes but you would expect it from the cuisine. Would come again. Only decor was a little stark and we had to sit on stools
5
I always love it when I order a set lunch menu in a restaurant and I get more than what was on the menu.I was first surprised with an amuse bouche of 2 delicious bite-sized snacks to get me ready for what's to come. Many restaurants of the equivalent price range do not bother with an amuse bouche. It was a good pairing: one had the vegetal sweetness of radishes, the other had the umami from salmon roe, both with crunchy textures from the pastry bases and ingredients.The scallops sashimi was next and it was divine. The softness and the sweetness of the scallops, melding with the sweet-tartness of shredded apples, melding again with the tartness and saltiness of the yuzu sauce was a fantastic experience. So harmonious, yet bursting with their own individual flavours.Seabass was next. The fish was perfectly pan-fried - crisp and flavourful skin, soft and tender flesh. Mushrooms were delicious and especially flavourful - were they cooked in dashi? I absolutely loved the mashed jerusalem artichoke, an highly underused ingredient in Singapore.Dessert was the 'Silver Pearl', a silvery orb served with pepper ice cream. The ice cream was tasty but a little milky for my liking - I thought it might have been better if the pepper aromas were stronger. The pearl was essentially a silver mochi skin enveloping a mix of white chocolate mousse and pear chutney. The tart-sweetness of the chutney was balanced against the smooth milkiness of the mousse, making for a delicious dessert with bursts of flavours in your mouth.When I asked for the bill, Meta proceeded to serve me another surprise dessert to end the meal - 'Frozen Cookie'. Without spoiling the surprise for future diners, let's just say it was a memorable experience. A pity I was there alone - it could make for some fantastic photos. :)This restaurant's food exceeded all my expectations and I cannot wait to return
2
Where is the wow factor. Its basically still korean food. Korean food served in a neat way. Oyster is oyster. Bibimpa is bibimap. Where is the wow.
4
The food was worth every penny I spent. The chefs are friendly especially Chef Sun Kim and Chef Louis. The atmosphere was very quiet and nice.
4
Food was interesting and good. Highchairs were uncomfortable, but somewhat understandable given the lack of floor area.
Service was reasonably attentive and affable. Will return.
5
I went here with a group of six. It is a very long thin restaurant, so it was tight, but the staff moved an extra table in for us that made it comfortable. Overall the staff and service were great. The place has a nice modern vibe to it without been to over the top. The highlight was the food. We have the 5 course menu and every dish was above and beyond expectations, along with some very tasty starters not listed with the menu. I will certainly be going back again
5
Small restaurant ideal for a date. My wife and I sat at the bar like most people overlooking the kitchen and it would have been a different experience if we had been at one of the few tables. We went for the 10-course Menu Degustation which is preceded by 2 amuse-bouches and followed by an interesting mignardise! Also took the accompanying wines which is highly recommended as one would struggle to find the right bottle of wine that pairs with so many different dishes. It's an interesting fusion of Korean and French cuisine. Nothing disappointed us. Enjoyed a nice chat at the end of the evening with Chef Sun and Pierre, the GM. It's always a wonderful experience to be interacting with the chef and his staff as you enjoy such gourmet food. We will definitely be back for the winter menu
5
I'm a huge fan of Korean food so I was very excited about this dinner. Turns out, it met my expectations with its wonderful ambience, taste and presentation! My only gripe was the Fig Tart that really wasn't sweet enough and I couldn't tell what the chef was trying to bring across. Other than that, wonderful experience.
4
The food has lots of ingredients and when combined formed a different taste bud experience! We could tell that there are at least 3 elements in the foods prepared by the chef - Japanese, Korean and Asian local tasted! Only drawback was it get quite noisy when the restaurant is full house.... The services was good as well as the foods are all impressively! I think the only aspect to be improve is their dessert..... I seriously don't find them as impressive but I like the last one -nitrogen-led "dragon breath" dessert called "The Rock "
1
This is the second time I tried to make a reservation at this restaurant, and both times, after successfully booking either over the phone or online, they called me back saying there was an error with their reservation system and they are over booked. Once is fine, but you'd expect the issue to be fixed before happening a second time.In addition, the man who called was completely unapologetic, nonchalant and did not make any effort to find a solution. I will not try to dine at this establishment again
4
We opt for the 7 course dinner, food were excellent, esp their desserts ( creative, pretty & delicious) are always my favorite. We were delighted with the extra bonus of 2 free appetizers & 1 korean pancake ( on the house) for diners. The oysters (from Ireland) that we ordered are fresh & delicious
4
The food is all very flavourful and yummy. Had the 5-course dinner set and it was filling enough. It's great to see such amazing Asian-European fusion food. Not usually a fan of fusion food but boy when it's done right it's highly addictive. There were many techniques like sous-vide and liquid nitrogen involved and it worked well into the dishes. The thing I love most about Meta is the intimate 20-seater counter set up. You'll get to see all the live action of each dish being cooked and plated with tweezer precision. And the best part is that the chef would then serve you and explain the dish.
5
Great restaurant - value for money. Most of the dishes had flavours that came together nicely with nothing overpowering or masking the other. Nice ambience too, I had a fantastic night out with my date.
5
Food was absolutely amazing and service are warm. Very very very nice food and plating every single dish make your tongue ALIVE!!! I will be back again for dinner. Highly recommended Meta restaurant, 3üëçüëçüëç üåüüåüüåü
4
Everything went on smoothly and well. Food is good but no wow factor for us. Service is good. Thank you!
4
The service is professional but not warm. I had heard mixed reviews about the food from friends. The menu is certainly interesting but not exciting enough to make me keep wanting to go back soon.
5
My second time visiting Meta. We came to their wine pairing dinner. The food was perfect and specially matched with the wine selection. We truly enjoyed our dinner and we definitely will come back!
Thanks to the team. Good job!
4
Good food - original - - bit loud
But overall nice experience
Decent wine list. Interesting and eclectic food
5
Fantastic dinner, I'm rarely impressed it's such a delight to discover this place definitely looking forward to future menu from this very high potential and fantastic team. Absolute delight !
4
food and service was excellent. every dish was done excellently and surprised me with a mix of flavors. the beer i had was the best i had in a long while. only downside was a mistake on the Chope website that indicated a ficticious 15% discount with SCB cards which you should correct immediately.
5
It's always an absolute pleasure to dine at Meta. I have tried their lunch menu. This time I had the 10 course degustation for dinner, every course is cooked to perfection. Portions were just right, presentation beautiful and the taste makes you want to go back for more. Kudos to Chef Sun and his team.
5
Very thoughtful, innovative menu. Everything was very well executed and presented beautifully. Some of the dishes had us wondering 'what is this? how did they make it?' Modern dining with many Korean flavours used in interesting and creative ways. The team seemed to delight in surprising the dinners with some unexpected extras! It's a tiny tiny dining room but the food, experience and service make up for it
4
Innovative kitchen, great food, friendly and competent service. Not for a very romantic occasion, but great for s first date.
5
Creative but unpretentiously good real food. The cuisine is an embodiment of east and west; absolutely satisfying. Reminds me of the 2 star Michelin restaurant Momofuku Ko in New York.
Price is reasonable considering the quality. Service is average.
5
From the beginning to end it was a total surprise that let us without words. Chefs and service are totally in symbiosis. Really a great experience!! Wine pairing was a very good deal!! We will come back for sure.
5
Pleasantly surprised...really innovative menu-excellent food! Everything was yummy especially the Uni rice. Service was good as well. I wish a great success for the chef and for the restaurant!
5
Ive have eaten here several times now and each time I am blown away by the consistent quality and flavour of the food. It is Korean in nature but deconstructed and unique, always with a fresh take on each idea.The deserts are fabulous and should not be missed. I particularly like their use of liquid nitrogen and smoker
5
It was my first fine dining experience and the atmosphere and service blew my mind off. What I wasn't quite used to (but I do still enjoyed it) was the food as I found some of the dishes to be both spicy/peppery with a hint of other tastes.Nonetheless, the cocktail was really good and Chef Sun and his staff were all very meticulous. They made me feel at ease even when I was the only dining customer at the moment.Thank you so much.I have no regrets dining at Meta on my birthday where they surprised me after knowing it was my actual birthday on the day itself

Keong Saik Road has been greatly transformed from its former days, and is now home to several hip dining concepts. I wanted to catch up with a foodie friend and celebrate the impending National Day of Singapore in my own way, and I heard Meta had a National Day menu. It was a night and dinner to happily remember at this unconventional restaurant, and summarised below.When we entered, it was mostly empty as we would be considered early diners. The long open-concept kitchen in this shophouse was sleek yet wonderfully-functional, and the entire interior of Meta looked like a space with well-planned and deftly-executed acoustics and details which could handle the noise volume of being full. This is an important factor when selecting a dining option with friends who have certain issues such as tinnitus. There was this quiet yet assuring energy in the kitchen, which comes from a team excited and inspired and knowledgeable about what they do, and reflected in their movements as they worked in the kitchen. This made me want to ditch the table, and sit on one of the high stools at the counter for dinner and watch (which has to wait until another visit). The wine selection and other drink options seemed promising in a nicely-collated and short menu. Upon discussing certain alcohol options with (I presume) the restaurant manager who could not sufficiently answer my questions about various options, I had to guess at a rum to suit my tastes, and it was fortunate that my guesswork was spot-on.I went for the National Day Menu at $151++, and my friend chose the Prix-fixe menu of 5 courses at $98++ with a supplementary order of an oyster at SGD 9. The dishes on the National Day Menu could be tricky to pull off, in terms of balancing the order and choices on the menu. The amuse bouche (see pictures) was lovely in plating and tasting and contrast, as I and my friend tried to guess at the ingredients used, and how the two delectable morsels had been prepared. There was also kaya toast with black truffle. I could have eaten this for an entire meal, the bread being well-chosen as a suitable host for the combined effect of kaya and black truffle, and such a dish could have easily been made mediocre in less-skilled and less-inventive kitchens. The starter of scallop carpaccio with guava, roasted grape and pomelo could not be faulted, and the preparation of such fruits as utilised in scallop carpaccio lends an extra dimension of taste and zing to what one thinks of the usual variations of scallop carpaccio available in restaurants here and in Australia. It was interesting and delectable and given what I had tasted so far, assured me that the kitchen had the substantial skills to impress beyond what some might assume as novelty.The chilli crab and egg custard was sublime. Head chef Sun Kim‚Äôs usage of dashi and coriander made this dish soar, and the bun which accompanied this dish was perfect. My only complaint here would be not having enough buns, and being greatly tempted more than once to ditch proper manners and simply use my tongue and fingers to get every last drop and morsel off the crockery.The chicken rice was light, fragrant and not too oily. Meta‚Äôs version of rice crackers replaced the usual rice, I adore what they did with the cucumber, and the spicy bak choy was hidden under the chicken. The bak choy could have done with a pinch more of spice, and some might say the chicken could have been more ‚Äúfragrant‚Äù, but I appreciate the necessary restraint for this dish (in light of the next course) and what was accomplished with the doenjang and without MSG. The weakest link of this menu is the oyster carrot cake, which resembled pizza upon presentation. The Irish oysters felt wasted here, and the chilli did not improve this dish. If this dish had been a chilled p√¢t√© using radish as crackers, with the chilli as it is, I wonder what the outcome would have been, and it is an outcome I would have liked to see and taste.The Rise of the Kim is a cocktail utilising kimchi, and it is a cocktail you can easily order again during the meal. A visit to the bathroom had me appreciating the aesthetics. Careful attention to detail was once again apparent here, including the choice of hand soap and scent diffuser used which complement each other and make for a memorable olfactory experience while also whetting the appetite, making me appreciate Meta even further. Trofie pasta and boston lobster was used in Meta‚Äôs version of lobster mee. This is the best lobster pasta I have eaten this year, and this current conclusion also applies to the chilli crab. I really was tempted to break dining etiquette and clean the plate with my fingers and tongue. I appreciate the effort, passion and inventiveness which Meta‚Äôs kitchen staff have put into their cooking, because such love and earnest dedication was apparent in what I ate. The 30-hours beef rendang using wagyu beef short ribs was decent. The balance of spices was right, the beef could have been a touch more tender, and the spice level was toned down (for understandably considerate reasons, given how some diners cannot take much spice). It would have helped if an option for a small saucer of rendang curry gravy was offered to diners to choose if they order this menu, so they could increase the spice level if desired. The first of 2 desserts was bubur chacha, using taro, sweet potato and coconut. The shell made of coconut was fun to eat, and this dessert managed to be refreshingly simple yet rich without being sickening, given the natural accumulated heaviness of flavours present in several previous courses. The dessert is solidly assuring and definitely above-average but not amazing, and this seems intentional when you taste the final dessert.The final dessert of reinvented teh peng (sweetened ice milk tea usually found in a coffeeshop ie kopitiam) took approximately 10 minutes to prepare and since the first teh peng might have been prepared a mite early, they did another little dynamite bomb for me. I was advised to quickly put the innocent-looking ‚Äúrock‚Äù upside-down in my mouth once the glass dome was removed, bite, exhale, and then savour the dessert. When I exhaled, I saw the small puffs of liquid nitrogen, and my reward after doing so was the most intensely delicious teh peng I have ever tasted.I would like to try Meta‚Äôs vegetarian menu, and also look forward to their special menus, and when the Summer menu changes. The cons: What I sampled from the bite-sized portions my friend gave me of the 5-course Summer menu seemed significantly-inferior in execution of concepts, and this is not about comparing the National Day Menu with this menu. The salmon tartare with dill and lime was pleasant, but left me wondering why it could not excel on a similar level as the scallop carpaccio. The slow-cooked octopus probably tastes better than what I tried and my friend enjoyed. I attribute my lesser enjoyment of it to the effects on my tastebuds from the dishes I had already tried on the National Day Menu (and I forgot to drink water before trying the octopus). I did not try the 3rd course of the duck. The rack of lamb had been so thoroughly marinated that if you do not want any taste of lamb, this dish will work. But the end-result was bewildering, and left it too tasteless for me. My friend really enjoyed her dessert utilising coconut and pineapple, but the chocolate she was given to finish had a strongly off-putting centre of‚Ä¶ eucalyptus?Despite the misses, it was a highly-enjoyable experience overall. Meta deserves to be recommended to friends who want fusion food skilfully executed, who want to watch the passion and discipline happening in this kitchen, and would like to experience the potential responsible for this gem of a restaurant. It is an exciting dining destination for locals and foreigners to try. That said, I hope the kitchen will be more consistent in their successes, and better knowledge of the drinks menu needs to be demonstrated by the service staff. And I look forward to the changing of the menu. All the ingredients for a revolutionary success in Singapore‚Äôs dining scene are present in Meta

I am usually not a fan of omakase styled dining as I would prefer to pick and choose but feeling adventurous I tried on recommendation. The restaurant received an award this year for best degustation meal from Wine & Dine and I totally understood why.The slow cooked beef was a winner for me. Timed to perfection served after 18 hours in the oven, the meat was tender and succulent. Coupled with sous chef Tammy's inventive pastry (Dragon's Breath), the meal was complete. Great to see how the chefs prepare the food while you eat, and you would understand the effort taken to serve and plate the dishes

French gastronomy with korean influences or refined korean with french classical execution. Whatever you call it, it's good. No one else is doing this and one of the best meals i've had in town. Set amongst a quaint row of shophouses, it's sleek modern interior provides a stunning contrast. Great food, great wines, great company. Thank you for an awesome evening! Will be back soon!

What more can you ask from a restaurant that ticks all the boxes? The restuarant atmosphere puts us at ease, the presentation and freshness of their food created such an amazing explosion in our mouth and of course, lets not forget the cute chef as well . Will definately be back to Meta again when we are back in Singapore.

Great food, wonderful service! A new modern setting worth going for everyone. The oysters are the best in the world I've ever tasted, I could easily finish few dozens!
5
Great dining experience. Great food. Creative food presentation. Nice people. A must visit!!! Highly recommended!!!
5
Absolutely marvellous. Sat by the bar watched the chefs had full menu + wine selection. Best dining experience to date in Singapore.

I had an excellent diner at Meta restaurant with my husband. I was honestly amazed by the quality and freshness of the food but also by the creativity and meticulousness of the different dishes.
Service was also really nice and helpful.
5
Exceptional experience at Meta. Food was one of the best I had in Singapore with a real creativity at every dishes. Perfect service. Great wine selection and also very good cocktails ! A must try!

Went there with my girlfriend for lunch. Booked the place online and told them I need a cake as it was my friend's birthday but no cake. A little disappointed but luckily was made up by good food and service.
Would defintely visit again.

It's good, but given the choice between dinner here for 98/128 or Cure on a weekday, I'd pick Cure in a heartbeat. I was here for the National Day special lunch, and it's definitely worthwhile for lunch. For $45-$58 you get a 4 or 5 course menu (for NDP it was $51) and the food is very good and very worth it. (And the head chef is very cute!) The hand wash in the bathroom is Hermes!Couple of feedback:- Probably because it's a new restaurant, wait times between dishes are a bit too long. I like my next course to come out right after I finish the first one! Drinks also took a while but they're delicious!- The biggest table they have is for 2. This means it'll be impossible to host business dinners here. From experience, every (high-spending) business dinner I have has involved at least 2 other people and you're missing out on a significant chunk of revenue just by not having bigger tables. I go for nice business dinners/ lunches every week, sometimes a couple of times a week. I go for nice one-on-one dinner maybe a couple times a month maximum

We dined at Meta based on my research on the website curious with the reviews that its a Korean touch French cuisine. The result is that we give it a 5 star! The ambiance is very nice, food presentation excellent, taste exceptional and very refreshing. Definitely do come before the restaurant is difficult to get reservations
5
We had the 5 course set dinner and every course was a treat - beautifully balanced flavours (interesting combinations), gorgeous presentation and impeccably cooked. Dessert was equally beautiful, delicate, put together to create an unforgettable combination of flavours.Added the oysters and Korean pancake, which were executed beautifully.Friends had the wine pairing and enjoyed it very much.We have many talented young chefs in Singapore but once in a while, someone stands out for his interesting menu. Outstanding work by the head chef Sun Kim and equally outstanding work by dessert chef Tammy Mah. Excellent value for money.Menu changes every season and we will be back for the Fall menu

Amid the wide range of food and beverages options along Keong Saik road (what a great street for going out!), we literally stumbled into Meta one Saturday evening.We were really warmly welcomed by the staff and the chef and seated at the counter looking into the kitchen proceedings.They went out of their way to cater for us as we initially were not going to take the degustation menu and we picked a few dishes. But we got so hooked that we kept ordering more delicious dishes.Again both the French speaking maitre d'hotel and the chef were very helpful.There is a strong sense of pride in the French-Korean cuisine proposed by Meta and genuine delight at our appreciation.We will return soon to sample the new seasonal menu

Desserts vert good. Food is great. Wine pairing is relevant. May not necessary to take the full menu; overall a great experience.
5
Food was inventive, delicious, with great ingredients. The best of French & Korean cuisines! Will definitely go ahead.

Enjoyed my experience at Meta. The place is quite small and we sat by the bar. Service is good, the preparation of food is fun to watch and the food, particularly the oyster, was great. We were 2 couples and had a great evening.
4
We had a very enjoyable and relaxing dinner. The vegetarian menu was surprisingly pretty good, and especially liked the seaweed pasta.
4
Been there to celebrate my friend's birthday, staff was very patient and good was great. Highly recommended to friends!
5
had the lunch set at $58 ++. Food was generally excellent, creative and meticulously prepared. The salmon appetiser tasty and the pork belly main was outstanding, better than the beef that was good but had an additional charge of $12.Servings are small.
5
The different ingredients that made up each dish complemented each other very well, thanks to the skills of the head chef Sun Kim. All the seafood elements i.e. the sea urchin, seabass, hamachi and especially the oysters were also very fresh and did not have a "fishy" smellI. I am not a fan of sous vide cooking so I was very surprised that I liked the sous vide quail. The Bingsu dessert was excellent. However, I didn't like the mango, passionfruit dessert because the different ingredients in that dessert tasted like they were 'standalones'. To be fair, some restaurants do construct their dessert like this and I have never liked that. Having said that I must add that the mango sorbet in that dessert was really yummy. And that was the saving grace for that dessert. The surprise complimentary dessert was unique and ....surprising!! Compliments to the pastry chef for her creativity.The service staff was attentive, very pleasant and knowledgeable about their dishes. Good job

We tried out Meta for the first time recently and we were glad we did. The interior design was modern, simple and classy. The food was good and interesting. There were a few cool creations which contained Korean cuisine elements. We loved the dessert as it was such a unique dish in taste and look, its subtle texture made it even more delightful. We could have eaten one more each! The wines were also nice. It was a very enjoyable and satisfying dining experience

Went for dinner with a friend visiting from Hong Kong who picked this venue to try. As such, I didn't do much research about it before hand. For a Wednesday dinner, it was rather quiet and empty and the restaurant itself was small. As such, it is not ideal for group above 3 as they do not have tables of 4 at all. Groups of 4 and above would be given seats at the bar which makes group conversations difficult. Food-wise, the 6 course Spring menu was pretty decent but did not wow me. It is also a fixed menu, no ala-carte. We had the wine-pairing as well but was quite surprised that the wines were not listed prior. I'd suggest trying this venue for lunch first to see if you like the ambience/food before trying it out for dinner

Ended a meeting in the area at noon so we adjourned to Meta for lunch.Ordered the lunch tasting set since that was the only option on the menu.It's fusion so the dishes seemed experimental although the flavours could be improved.You'll be spoilt for choice when it comes to dining at Keong Saik. Unfortunately this restaurant has nothing to shout about
5
Wonderful food and amazing customer service (rare in Singapore). Great for a special dinner and night out with loved ones and friends. Every course was well executed and presented. Highly recommended and already have had a few friends visit since.

Chef Sun Kim is indeed masterclass... Culminating a menu that harmonises the freshest of the season that is impact with flavors and creativity. Is a refined art work eating i
5
Done a fair bit of traveling and eating over 7 score years plus and this lunchtime tasting meal enjoyed today has to rank as one of the best ever sampled!

Decided to have a quick lunch, most nice places are closed on Mondays in Singapore. Thankfully, Meta is not.Very small venue - that's neither here nor there. The only thing I would say was beverages weren't offered after I was seated - I had to request for the beverage menu. Kitchen staff seemed focussed and diligent.Couldn't fault the food, all flavours worked in harmony. I would return. Sun Kim, is the Executive Chef. Like his food he is also good to look at
3
I liked the wagyu beef, the Korean pancake. Portion sizes small. Just about right for me, but maybe not enough for men. Seating plan is better for a party of two, not really good for a 4+ person meal. Liked the show at the bar. Food is above average, but not enough for me to go back again
5
Went there for the lunch tasting menu. There were 5 courses including the amuse bouche. Food was great and the price was very reasonable for the standard we are getting. The manager will introduce every dish throughout our meal. My wife did not eat raw food so an alternative dish was given. A mixologist will ask what type of cocktails you like and mix a bespoke cocktail just for you. Head chef will often drop by to ask for feedback and explain the food too. It was an experience sitting at the counter watching the chefs work
3
Maybe it's not quite settled in and Korean fusion is not for me. First they lost my reservation. Given they actually acknowledged it over email is kind of poor reservation management given its a small place. But they did accommodate us, at the table at the back of the restaurant, where the wine chiller unfortunately makes it quite warm to sit at. They kindly moved us to the counter when we asked. The food leans heavy to the tangy Korean tasting side, so great if you like that. Was ok for me but not to my taste as much. Doubt I'd go back only because the Korean fusion slant isn't something I discovered I would enjoy. Wine pairing was good though
5
We had one of the most fabulous lunch. Chef Sun has indeed been superlative in presenting a menu that harmoniously blend the flavours of spring imbue with a touch of Korean, Asian and modern European technique in this menu. If one is a crazy foodie like myself, dont give a second thought about other restaurant. Just eat at Meta

First of all this review may have been very different had the air conditioning been working properly. We were informed that it had been down only that day and given the very hot spell outside the dining experience was marred by the uncomfortable dining experience. To the food. This was the first time having fusion Korean - I'm not sure there are many places that serves such food - I have never been that's for sure. The food is a set - there is no allacarte selection (you can change dishes to suit food allergies etc) and you can also choose a wine pairing also. There is a bar there and one of the highlights I had was the cocktail that was served with Kim Chee. The food was ok but not exceptional. Being in the busy and trendy keong saik area you need to really stand out to get repeat business. I would have to think hard to return.
5
I'm not sure words can justify how good the food was, how beautifully presented it was, or how amazing the overall experience was. Every dish was a new combination of Flavours and textures that I wouldn't have thought would be work, but were the best dishes I've had in Singapore for the 7 years that i have lived here. A definite place to visit, and definitely somewhere I'll be returning to
