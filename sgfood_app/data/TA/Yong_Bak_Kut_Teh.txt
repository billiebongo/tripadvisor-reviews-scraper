I dined at this stall 2-3 decades ago, and in the midst of all the changes in Singapore, they stood the test of time. That in itself speaks for everything.

Very delicious bak kut teh. Reasonably priced. One of the very best in singapore. Located along river valley and situated in a coffee shop. Must try

Bland, lacks flavour and taste. The surrounding is also a bit dirty even for hawker standard, kitchen dark and looks dodgy. Service is quick - but careless, and waiters look unhygienic too.

I miss Mr. Malaysia Bah Kut Teh so much until my boyfriend canâ€™t stop suggesting we need to have it.A friend of him recommended us this place and no regrets! Really tasty and meaty. Soup is herby and unlike others peppery? Is really good deal for 2 @ $28 for 3 dishes with rice.The great news is that the soup can be refill as much as you like and we did. Will definitely be back! Plus? The server were kind and efficient looking after our needs. Lovely place and easy to find. The shop we went was located at River Valley. You should go too;

Came for dinner with my hubby after work and this was the only stall that was opened in the coffee shop. It was expensive and the meat was tough, and I mean tough even for the prime ribs.. Soup was not bad but mind you,they only limit the top up of soup for three times. When we ordered for two persons,there was only one clay pot with 5 pieces of meat inside,and when they wouldn't let us top up more soup,I guess it broke all chances of coming back again. 2 tiny bowls of rice,1 bowl of soup, 1 side order of pig trotters and salted vegs and the total amount comes up to S$30. Definitely not worth it
