Had a dinner around 6pm with spouse. Ordered Grilled Spanish Mackerel with special lime sauce, Tom Yum Gung (Prawn), Pineapple Fried Rice and Stir Fried Assorted Vegetables with Seafood.Food quality was better than expected and went down well with us. We had been to Thailand many times, and the food here is really good enough. Personally I like the pineapple fried rice as it was just nice, not too sweet or heavy. Mackerel was not dry, just nice and moist after a light grill. The tom yun soup was tangy, refreshing and generously prepared with prawns and mushrooms, and satisfyingService is also pretty good and responsive.If you are looking for a nice place to have Thai food, I would recommend a stop here to fuel your cravings

Good tasty food, quiet and cosy place, and at a relatively reasonable price! Will go back nxt time to try other items on the menu!

Had lunch here as other restaurants were crowded. The food tasted just average. Price is average as well

The watermelon fried rice wasnt that fantastic, tasted like ordinary fried rice. Tom yum wings no different as normal wings. Upon checking they returned telling me that they only sprinkle Tom yum powder on top of it. Tom yum soup was salty and not spicy at all. Ambience was ok but service is very slow.

Wide range of dish selection, excellent service. Location is convenient and accessible. Price is affordable

2nd time back to the outlet, and the food quality remained constant. Good flavours, ingredients were well-chosen, although a dish - Moo Yang(grilled pork) was a little too salty. Som Tam was punchy enough in the heat level, and the papaya tasted young enough(juicy and crunchy, not soggy). The grilled mackerel had solidly tender flesh, although the choice of fish's belly meant there were more bones and a bitterness on the palate most customers won't like.Portions were slightly below expectations, where 3 dishes for 2 persons still left us with much room for more. This came up to around $40.Service was still very prompt, efficient, but friendliness was down a notch on a Thursday evening, compared to the previous visit 3 months ago. Plenty of space in the evening, a pity for the above average quality of food on offer

Good thai food in CBD area at reasonable prices. Gets crowded during lunch though. Their phad thai and tom yum soup gets a thumbs up

A bright and spacious casual dining restaurant on the 4th floor of One Raffles Place (formerly known as OUB centre).The menu (with pictures) offers a good range of the usual Thai favourites such as tom yum soup, green curry, papaya and mango salads and pad thai. Today for lunch we had the two rice dishes that were topped with a fried egg (beef stir fry for one of us and pork and basil stir fry for the other - see pictures). We also shared a papaya salad.We asked for the heat to be turned up for our food but what we had wasn't terribly spicy.Like many offerings in the business district, the food is average rather than stellar. This is a useful option if you work in or are visiting Raffles Place and are in the mood for Thai food.If you want to avoid the crowds, it's best to get to the restaurant early (before 12 pm) or later (after 130 pm). We paid SGD44 (USD31) for lunch
