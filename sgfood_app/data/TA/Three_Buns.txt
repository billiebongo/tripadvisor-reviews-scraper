I really enjoyed their dishes during previous savour event which they took part.Have eaten here around 4 times ... mostly as take away.Decided to dine in one day and notice their beers is $17 per bottle (like Asahi Superdry black) which is actually same price as their entry level burgers... the beer is not even pint size.. is those 330ml size only So boo to their pricey beersThey have Wide variety of burgers... tried their baby Huey, smokin b boy, four floors , kool herc (I think) etc.... is good but pretty much taste similarIf they find a technique on how to introduce aus jus into their patty it will be fantastic.... maybe have to inject aus jus inside or do what Xiao Long bao people do..I don’t know.This the reason why I still think Omakase burger is still the best Cos is so juicy and has so much aus jus I keep using my spoon to collect and pour the aus jus over the burger again and again... other burgers just feels dry now that i am spoilt Will be heading to Tokyo and trying shake shack soon... base on YouTube videos it doesn’t look like they have aus jus in their patty too..

Me and my family ordered three burgers and a portion of fries. For the burgers we had four floors, smoking b-boy and baby huey. I have to give special recommendations to smoking b-boy for its bursting flavour. The fries we had were naughty fries and are HIGHLY recommended. Don't forget to ask for their mayo and chili sauce which i think are homemade and goes really well with the fries. The fries were really crispy and something Ive never tried before. It was like combining potato wedges and potato chips! The ambience was especially hip too and would definitely be a great place to bring your friends on a Friday night. However i have to touch on one of the down sides to this amazing place which was the price. For the small - mid sized portions, the prices would be worth it if it was a few dollars cheaper. Other than that the service was great and the food was awesome so i had a great experience there

As you'll see from the number of reviews I have I travel extensively and hence eat out regularly. I normally grab a burger at some point on my travels and after being in Asia for a while I fancied one during my time in Singapore... So I headed to Three Buns.I'm sorry to say that the burger (in fact all the food) I had at Three Buns did not come close to expectations and was a disappointment on several levels. Firstly the portion sizes were small, the portion of French Fries was not even what I would call a 'kids' portion. Secondly my Fun Boy Three Burger and Fries was excessively priced at SG$26 (before tax) which is circa GB£15.50 for the quality of what I had. Thirdly the Sticky Toffee Pudding and Clotted Cream dessert I ordered was served up as if it were part of an 'in-flight' economy meal. It came in a foil pot covered with a condensated up pop on plastic lid, with the cream in another plastic tub placed on a plate which I then had to serve out myself. This is not what you expect in a sit down restaurant. My burger was quite tasty but I left Three Buns still feeling hungry and feeling like I had received poor value. My total bill was SG$54.14 (GB£32) for my meal, a side of very average coleslaw and one Coke Light, which was about 40% more than it was worth! The only good thing about Three Buns was the funky building and funky decor that it's located in. The 4 floors are each decorated out very well and it had a great ambiance. I ate on the roof terrace and that too was very pleasant. Just a shame the food and value for money was poor. I'd not eat here again

Hubby and I went burger hunting and read great reviews online about Potato Head Folk. It was crowded as expected on a Saturday night. Reservations are a must! Loved the ambience and low lights, very romantic and the roof top bar especially so...We ordered the Burning Man and Fat Boy Three, cheesy truffle fries and spicy wings. The burgers were fabulous! Seasoned well, nicely charred and medium rare on the inside. It was seriously melt in your mouth. The fries were ok, how wrong can you go with truffles and cheese, but the wings were disappointing... too much batter, and the sauce was cloyingly sweet. If burgers are what you want, then definitely come here for that

Love love love this place! We had to sit outside cos it was fully booked up. Chanced upon this place cos we parked nearby and it turned out to be fab. The guy at the counter was really good about recomendations and we loved what we orderd. My son had the Truffle Hound hotdog which was fab too. Next time will call ahead for reservations cos it was a little muggy sitting outside by the five footway despite the fans overhead. But the smiley service and the delish food made up for it. We'll be back

Three Buns by Potato head folk offers a great selection of unique burgers. My favourite is the Burning Man with roasted jalapeno relish. They also offer a strong range of craft beers and cocktails. Tip: Burgers are on the small side, especially for the price point so you might need to get that extra patty or sides

we'd expected to lunch before a meeting nearby and it was a tough choice along Keong Saik Road... Three Buns at 36 is kinda missed because the large window lettered "Potato Head" and you will see it shares the units upstairs with others :)Going upstairs a tightly sprawl of burger related décor is found and if you arrive at 12.30pm it will be full and they take their last lunch order just before 1pmBeing that it was just after May4 the "Chewbakkwa" special jumped out and I ordered that without any regrets YUMx3the first things that strikes me was the respect they give to their burgers and they are served alone = this is what AND all you need.... and it was seriously enough and deliciouswhile our group had individually wrapped & delivered servings, we did share a side of fries which tasted phenomenal glad to have been here once, if nearby may drop by again

Loved Potato Head in Jakarta! Tried Three Buns cos of its connection. We had two burgers - smoking b-boy and burning man. I liked that the cheddar was double smoked, adding complexity to the burger. The tangy spiciness of the jalapeño in the burning man against the mayo and smoky cheddar wowed me. Loved the naughty fries and down with Malbec. Yum! Loved every bite of it

This place is connected to Potato Head Folk, and they serve up some incredible burgers. Must try the Tuff burger and Naughty Fries!

The Dizzy Rascals n Fun Boy Three burgers are so good. One of beat burgers in town. The taking order is very friendly and helpful. Glad we are here for dinner

Great gourmet burger joint house in an old colonial shophouse. Nice deco too. Their burger patties are tender and juicy. Order them medium, that when you get the full flavor and juiciness. Keep up serving great burgers. Thumbs up.

Burgers are GREAT. Rambo lamb burger is delicious. The fries with sweet chili sauce and all that is DELECTABLE. The atmosphere is amazing, there's a cute rustic bar on the third floor, and the rooftop terrace is great.

I tried their Rambo burger and thought I've seriously had better and juicier lamb burgers. Their Naughty Fries were also just so-so.

First off the bat, after coming from Thailand to Singapore the prices at this burger joint seemed crazy high. However, the food was fresh and tasty. SGD $10 for a milkshake seemed overly excessive for the small shake we received but we were hungry enough not to mind. Burgers were great, if you have a craving for a decent burger, this is the place to try

WW chose and early family dinner. The venue is superb in the rennovated old China Town building. Then menu is interesting burgers and sides. We ordered two burgers and 2 sides - wings and these marinated quails eggs. All up very good. Burgers were good I would not say amazing beef patty is a tad small but good balance. The quails eggs were unusual in beetroot marinade but excellent. Wings again different and nice. My only gripe would be the price of the drinks wine all around 16$ is a bit stiff for casual dining. Cocktails 20++.Noteably the decor is excellent.

We were disappointed with Potato Head at the Three buns restaurant Singapore. The reviews we had read were not accurate. The food was average and the burgers were small and very expensive. It cost us over $70 for two burgers and two drinks. Do not recommend this restaurant.
3
I'm going to get straight to the point- 4 stars for the burger and salad, 2 for the price. I had their signature "Smoking B-boy" which managed to be smoky, sweet, spicy and salty at the same time. Very good, robust, strong flavors. The light and generous Secret Garden salad was also tasty, topped by sauerkraut/ some sort of pickle. But the price of that burger, at $25, is way too high. They have a promotion at the moment which takes 25% off but that's still steep for a relatively small, albeit delicious, burger. Bring it down to $15 and I'll likely be a repeat customer.

Being up for a lunch outside our usual Raffles Place haunts, a couple of us decided to take a short taxi ride to this quirky little hamburger place located on the second floor of a corner Chinatown shophouse on Keong Saik Rd.We would highly recommend the Burning Man - a burger served with spicy jalepaeno peppers and the Baby Huey burger (your basic burger done right). The Naughty Fries (fries topped with chilli) were good too. You can view the menu online.The restaurant has recently introduced a set lunch at SGD28 - you get your choice of the more basic burger options, one side, a drink and dessert. While not currently an option for the set, we suggested to the lovely manager Nora that it would be helpful if diners could opt for a fancier burger by topping up on the price.Service was attentive and friendly. Our request for well toasted hamburger buns was nicely accommodated. We found the pricing quite competitive for the quality of the food. Our meal comprised one set lunch, two a la carte burgers and one order of Naughty Fries - total =SGD91 (US$67).If you are a visitor having a wander around Chinatown and are not up to checking out local food options, Three Buns is a good spot for lunch or dinner. For those who want to escape the crowds at Raffles Place/MBFC, Three Buns works for a quick burger meal

We found this place next to our hotel and they serve great burger and milkshake for our late night supper.
Design is nice and location is close to many intersting shop

Needed a quick lunch so stopped here.
Had the hot dog and fries, hot dog was nicely cooked as were the fries.
Food was good, if a little pricey, but compatible to prices in London.

Burger is more than 20 bucks and does not include fries. The burger is burnt and tasted so so. Waiter also did not check how i would like my patty to be done. He has to be prompted twice. First and last visit.

Burgers were ok, nothing more, definitely not "gourmet type", rather small and priced 20-30$. We were served at the rooftop bar. Tiny tables, bit run down decor, yet prices for drinks beat the Marina Bay gourmet restaurants. I ordered Diet Coke - it was served warm, 7$ for a can. Beer 15$ per 0,3 l bottle. I honestly don't accept prices like that in a burger joint and that is the reason for my low rating

If you happen to be in the Keong Saik area (w/boutique hotels, old shop lots converted into western eateries serving tapas, asian fusion italian, french etc), then perhaps a visit to ThreeBuns for some good burger is worth your while. Must say the burgers are not cheap with most going for S$20 or more. My party of 3 had 3 burgers, 2 drinks n a side of cheesy fries topped with mince beef and chilli (nice) came to $97.00

The burgers are amongst the better ones in Singapore, and that was why I revisited several times. That said, the service staff and the kitchen do not remember your orders very well (50% failure rate from personal experience), and prefer to argue that you have been served your order (until you whip out a picture to tell them it's the wrong one). On my last trip, which will remain as such, I sent my burger back twice, first time because an additional order of cheese wasn't present, and the second time because the kitchen just slapped on a cold slice of cheese. Mind you, I had taken a bite already before realising the cheese was absent, and the kitchen refried that half eaten patty. Pretty disgusting and I walked out

Yes- it's a bit precious with the preciousness that is Potatohead... But dammit, the burgers are good. Really good. In fact, better than most mealy, poorly cooked burgers you find elsewhere in Singapore. So, go... And order one. Sit down at a sidewalk table. Have some roasted corn (yes!) or coleslaw (also yes!) and enjoy a well cooked and delicious burger.

Been here several times and they make a great burger. I like the Rambo and several of the others that I can't remember the name. They wings I didn't care for and I wanted the chicken sandwich but they were out! How can you be out of chicken? I will go back but it is very expensive and for sitting outside on some of the worst chairs ever it is very expensive, even by Singapore standards. $19 for a bottle of beer. Import or not it's a small bottle and expensive

Went with my wife for a nice dinner for two. After we polished off our two Burgers, and before we polished off our Desserts and Drinks, we were asked to move to another table. A bit rude that. Having waited 45 minutes for our table, we could have been afforded a little more consideration

Went to Three Buns on a Friday with my wife on an impromptu date night.Fortunately did not need to wait for a seat although I'm sure Potato Head (joint restaurant upstairs) was probably packed. Ordering is simple. You go to the main counter, place your order, pay and collect your order number and wait for the food to be delivered.I ordered the Honky burger and my wife ordered the Smokin B-Boy. Food came in decent time but there was nothing that screamed out that the burger was worth the money. Paying close to $30 for the quality you're given is just robbery. It's not a bad burger and cooked to a good level (medium) but there is absolutely no difference between going here and going to Brewerkz. The main difference is that at Brewerkz you'll at least get a pint included. Chip portions are generous but incredibly salty. Drinks selection is pretty good. All Japanese beers including the fantastic Hitachino brewery however $20/bottle is again almost daylight robbery. Knowing the distributor of these beers means I know that this place is charging close to 100% markup on these beers which is just ridiculous. It is not worth visiting this place. If you really are hankering for a decent burger then it is worth going to somewhere like Brewerkz where you can get a pint and a burger for the price of just a burger here and be just as satisfies
