We had a quick business dinner at Andes by Astons in Changi Terminal 4 and enjoyed the food - both lamp chops and fish were well prepared and tasty.

I had the New York Steak yesterday at Changi T4.
The steak quality is below average. You can have a better steak at the nearest hawker center or for better value for money if you eat at T2 Swensen.

The operator has managed the assembly lines very well and the food delivery and services are well done. The outlet that I had tried is at Viva Business Park and the food is very tasty.

Me and my bf went to the Downtown East outlet during evening for dinner. Queue was a bit long but we managed to find a table within 10 minutes. We both ordered Ribeye Steak with mash potatoes and Mac N Cheese as our sides. It was delish! Steaks were well cooked as we wanted Medium Well. Mac and Cheese tasted good as well! Staffs need to smile more :) Overall, We will come back again

20/Jan/2018Visited the outlet located at Changi airport T4 level 2.Food was good, waiting time for the food to be served was acceptable, staff was overall not so friendly except one of staff named Nick Lee .we ordered 8 main course ,but all the side dish were totally wrong and mixed up. The tall skinny chinese guy (didn't manage to know his name )was very rude ,when we informed him that all our side dish were served with wrong plate of main, instead of taking any efforts to double check or anything, he just looked at us like:can you guys be faster answer me who is having this plate? The plate is freaking heavy and i still have other freaking table need to go... After the "fed up" face guy just left the last two table on the table and ran away from us becasue he felt that it was kitchen's mistake or whatever he didn't bother to resolve, the other staff name Nick Lee attended us to find out the problem and without arguing or giving us kind of annoying face, he confirmed our side dish and quickly changed all the plate with correct side dish for us! And didn't forget with smile and sincerely apologize! Good job and thanks sir! You take a part to make our families dinner perfect!

My family and I went to the new branch at Terminal 4. Ambience was nice and service was great. Waiting time was not long and portion of food was acceptable. It was my first time there and the cashier was very patient with my orders. Thank you for that

If you are looking for western food in a comfortable setting, Andes is a good place to do that. The portions are just enough so no need to worry about not finishing your food. Given that this is a Halal restaurant, note that liquor or beer is not being served

Went over to Changi outlet. We had steaks..ribeye extra cut. Asked the cashier wats de difference between the normal and extra cut...normal is 180g..while extra cut is 250g. Therefore..we took the extra cut..with just additional $2. So it was only $19.90 with 2 sides.Ours doneness was medium well. Steak was just nice....and filling. Easily to chew as well! Must try out again...The teriyaki chicken was nice too...thgh my gerl dun reali like the teriyaki sauce bt eating just the chix was enough as well. Hot choco was ok...nothing special...feels like drinking an instant drink. Bt its alright.Comfy environment...affordable...and great place to have a gooood steak

Its hard to find good halal steak restaurant in singapore. There is one new restaurant recently opened which is andes. I highly recommend this restaurant as the food is delicious and the portion size is more than enough. It is halal version of aston. Good food and great ambience

The food is great. I went to the one at Viva Business Park (near Bedok MRT/Mall). If you go during dinner (6-9pm), the queues are pretty long so be prepared to wait. The service is good and the food is great. Most of the chicken dishes cost $9.90 and they come with 2 free side dishes. Although there was some fat, the chicken was tender. I recommend trying the Black Pepper Chicken with Pasta Salad as one of your side dishes. Enjoy your meal here :
