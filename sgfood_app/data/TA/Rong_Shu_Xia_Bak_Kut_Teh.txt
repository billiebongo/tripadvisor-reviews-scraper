My kids are fussy eaters. Yet they love the bah kut teh which is so flavourful. My kid enjoyed the intestines very much while the adults had the tasty xo prawn noodle.

Delicious Bak Kut Teh that represents Malaysia JB and also very nice XO Claypot Prawn Noodles. Cheap with items mostly below $10. Easily nicer then many over price tourist trap bak kut teh restaurant. If you come to singapore, please visit and try.
