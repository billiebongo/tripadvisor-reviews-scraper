A quick stop for lunch with a nice surprise of really good food at very good prices. Really happy with the service, fast and friendly. Loved the noodle dishes we ordered, just the right amount of spice and great flavours. Relaxed and comfortable restaurant.

If you feel turned off by the appearance/location, donâ€™t be! Food was amazing as was the service! Would also recommend the juice bar nearby

If you are craving for some noodle, be it soup or dry, you can try this restaurant, conveniently located near Bugis streets. The taste is good and affordable. Great place to have a quick lunch/dinner in Bugis area.

Before proceeding to Bugis street where we could buy Singapore souvenirs, we decided to eat our late lunch and picked this Noodle house. The food is savory and within budget!

If you are Indonesian, this place is selling quite authentic Indonesian chicken noodle. Forgot the name, but it's the first picture. Really Super nice. Definitely will come back again in future

During my ventures in the Bugis street region this noodle place caught my eye and since I love noodles why not have lunch at the noodle house. Very quick service, clean place, good selection. I had the pork noodle soup and it was delish. Can recommend the place for lunc

Located across the bugis junction, next to bugis market and the crossing. The joint open until 11 pm - where most of the eating place would be closed already. If your type of traveling is walking down the city, you definitely will appreciate a place to fill up after a long day of walk.The restaurant had a long line of history for over than 50 years. The taste is quite good but not over the top. Specially when you're a noodle eater - i'm sure you'll have a lot of comparison and noodle vocabulary. The signature noodle is thin, quite sticky and sweet. It's more like a malay or indonesian type of peranakan noodle compare to chinese noodle - A bit hong kong / cantonese. The soup is light and tasty.But if i have too choose for my late dinner, i would go and grab a chicken, pork, duck roast over rice - next door. (Which also open till 11 pm). Hope you find this review useful

The food of this place was pretty stellar... our group had a variety of dishes which were all great. It seems to have won a lot of media exposure with the whole wall covered in paper cuttings reviewing the place and there were a lot of local patrons which probably gives the place a thumbs up. Superb spot for lunch very close to Bugis market.

Had a quick lunch as this place was recommended. Tried their dried noodles with a bowl of soup (separated). My friend had Lor-Mee.The dried noodles are so-so only. Although they added some seasoning, the taste does not blend into the noodles. The soup however, is really awesome. The taste is there and yet not overpowering. Even the Lor-Mee soup based is awesome (slightly thicker also), and its white soup based.Visitors trying for the first time, do go for soup noodles. I do believe it would be tastier :

As the name describe, they are famous for noodle. On their menu, they have 2 types of special noodle. One is the black sauce while the other is original. Somehow it taste more like Malaysian style but they show their history on their wall is from Singapore.It is kind of unique special recipe that only QQ has, so it is worthwhile to try. Also there are a lot variety of food and the waiting time is not long. My office is very near here so sometimes I come with colleagues for our lunch. Not much for the service but mainly people come for the noodle. You need to press the button on the table if you require assistance from staff. Normally I just write on the paper the number and pay at the cashier.As for the price, it is relatively reasonable especially it is aircondition restaurant. I come here more than 5times and decide try different dish and it taste not bad too. Also, I tried their black sauce fried noodle which taste a little similar as Singapore common food "chay kuey tiao". Sweet taste noodle. It may get crowded around 1215pm where most office personnel came out for lunch during weekday
