Located inside the Singapore casino we found the food to be awesome and well priced. The staff were also fantastic, I will definitely go back.

Inside the casino at Marina Bay Sands hotel, service was quick and efficient and quite a large menu. Food was very tasty and worth the visit

A decent option when you are taking a break from the casino tables. It seemed to be open 24x7 which is a good thing.

Simple food which you get inside the casino. Try the dumpling noodles and the best part is, it open late at night as well, probably 24X7

Have eaten here a few times over the past five years.
Yesterday I enjoyed a simple dish of fresh beans and minced pork - it was enough by itself - quite tasty.
If you need a snack this is ok.

This establishment located in the Marina Bay Sands Casino is very bad, they have difficulty too explain to the customers what is the meal proposed in menu card. We take Chinese nuddles with prawns..But in the full plate was only 2 small prawns, a very small part of old fish and rest only old nuddles, We can't eating this, for dessert I requested and almonds cream with lychees but this cream we like stone with smell and cannot eating.So I complain them but the supervisor ask me the cook changing..This isn't customers problem especially for 21 dollars.After lo get discussion they delete one of 2 plates from bill and one dessert

The daily specials here are always good and decently priced, like the rest of their main menu. They have a nice little selection of dim sum, and their chicken rice is the same one served at the hotel lobby restaurant "Rise." The service is fast and the staff is always looking around to make sure everyone is taken care of - which makes a big difference when you want to get back out there and continue a lucky streak
