A typical Korean bbq restaurant. Serve variety of pork and beef. Service average but worth to try once.

I was here recently with a group of colleagues for a send-off dinner of one of the group. This is one of numerous Korean restaurants (many of which offered barbecued meats) that have sprung up in this part of the island, and this outlet is apparently the 500th of its parent chain spread all over Asia. As the name of the restaurant suggests, the main attraction is barbecue, and the main produce is meat, or more specifically, beef, pork, and to a lesser extent, chicken. The concept was simple enough - order enough marinated meat for the entire group, make sure a grill is placed over the fire, and start cooking the meat. A limited number of side dishes are also available, including the highly recommended Korean seafood pancake and kimchi-based soups help to break up the monotony of the rather carnivorous fare. There are number of table sauces available for dipping, and lettuce is meant as an accompaniment. Aside from that, good company, and perhaps some alcohol, make for a good time

My first time here, and I just love it! It has almost the same ambience compared to the BBQ restaurant I went in Seoul. The meat is of good quality and the marinate is good too! The taste is not too strong, but subtle enough to give some flavour to the meat. The beef sushi is sooo good too! Honestly, I think this is worth the money. We ordered the Pork Combo + 1 portion of extra chicken meat for BBQ + Kimchi Stew. All these for 4 pax and we paid about $28 per pax. It's definitely value for money because of the quality of food they serve. Definitely will be back!

We decided to try Korean after finding the other restaurant we wanted to go to was full. This place is one of a large chain and seemed popular. We opted not to have the cooking experience and ordered bbq beef and bbq pork sizzling plates ($13 each). These were served with kimchi, a beansprout salad and Korean pickles - nice slightly sweet and sour celery, and a bowl of sticky rice each. There was enough food for the two of us and it was quite tasty. The waiters obviously don't get may English speakers in because we all found it difficult to communicate

We ( 2 A and 2 C) went to this place during Raya holiday. When we arrived, the restaurant is 70% full around 7pm plus. The waiter ran out to greet and showed us the seat. We ordered the small pork set, kimchi pancake and one bottle of soju, 3 bowls of rice. It was quite fast for the meal set up initially; however it was slow down after the set arrived. The set consisted one bowl of soup, 3-tiers meat plater, 4 pieces of rice roll and a plate of salad. Apparently, only 1-2 person serving around 12 tables. The soup and rice roll came with the set were quite tasty; salad was quite unique with black sesame sauce. The meat portion is a bit expensive, $65 for small portion of meat mixture. The meats were all tendered after BBQ. We spent around $137 for this meal. The receipt showed no service charge and gst being charged.

Do not go there, service is horrible and portion is a joke! We did not order the set menu and ordered 2 different types of beef and 1 chicken. When it arrive, the $23 portion of chicken is on the size of 1 thigh!!! When I question the waiter, he say it's by weight, 160g, I ask for manager, he say there is no manager, all are part timers and we cannot return the portion as it has already been cut?!??We had 1 pancake and 1 soup, 2 rice wine and cost us $197!!!

I went to this restaurant few times, and NO ONE should try this place as the service was horrendous, nothing like the original Mapo Galmegi you know in Korea, also the lady manager is not only unprofessional, but with no service mind . When asked the manager to speak , she ignored, let the meat burnt and asked staffs not to serve the table. Very dirty toilets and I see people working the food line, do not wash hands when went to the toilet. I strongly suggest many other Korean restaurants in the region, Super star K is very good, Super Chicken, Shin Manbok, any restaurant will be better than this horrible place
