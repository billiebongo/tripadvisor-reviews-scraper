Nice little bar in China town you've gotta try the cocktails here. Great little tasty dishes the fried squid was really nice

We decided to have dinner here one night because it was air conditioned. The menu is limited, the food arrived randomly eg: a main before the starters. The food was good, I can recommend the Mango Salad.

Food was oke, but the speed of service very low (which one would not expect from a Thai restaurant) and our meals did not come at the same time also. No toilet in the restaurant it self, some 50 meters further in China Town

We enjoyed one of our favourite meals here for lunch. We shared the Pineapple Rice which was a surprise as it incorporated seafood & chicken with a lovely unique sauce and the most delicious spring rolls ever. The mocktails were tasty and refreshing.

Amazing Thai food. The pad thai was delicious and everything was reasonably priced. It was only 8SGD for the lunch time menu which included a soft drink. I would definitely recommend. Good vegetarian options too!

Not sure if negative reviews are based on different cooks, but my wife and I agree that this is the tastiest and freshest Thai we've eaten in SG. Service is slow and menu limited, so order some cheap drinks while you cool off in Chinatown.

This is within Chinatown's food street. They were happy to vegetatian'ize their set menu. It turned out pretty good. Loved the spring rolls and Mango salad. There were only a few guests, though.. would have liked a better crowd.

Ordered pad Thai and crispy squid.....both small portions and tasteless. Very disappointing meal. And no local beer available...only more costly imports. In Chinatown?....what a Joke!

We couldn't get served in Fatty Wengs so gave Mooks a try for a lunch bite.We had the chicken and cashew and it was okay, not too exciting but pleasant.Tiger beer to wash it down, not sure that happy hour was much of a saving, be nice to have a better choice of beers too.Not too bad if you want to duck out of the Chinatown heat for a while

I had passed by a few times and looked the menu up online. I was quite keen to try the basil chicken. However service was so poor that I ended up leaving as no one ever came to take my order. A shame really. Maybe others will have better luck
