Excellent location in Orchard to high-tea with friends. 48++for 2 is good choice. I like Lychee tea. Food is good overal
5
Warm atmosphere, warm honey lavender tea and warm Quesadilla. This is the best time to spend in a rainy day like today!
5
Treated myself to lunch at Arteastiq today and thoroughly enjoyed the food, the people who attended to me were very pleasant and professional as well. Will definitely come back!

Service was nice and friendly, food was tasty and fresh. The Tee menu is quite large. I had a cold tea, which was very refreshing. Definitely an upscale breakfast / lunch place for a mall. I’d eat here again!
3
Worst service. Had to wait for 10mins until the receptionist came.
Inattentive staff.........
I will not come back
5
Great place for weekend brunch. Great selection of teas. Very pretty instagrammable tea set :)
Nice decor. Would be interested to try out the pairing session next time!
4
Overall it was a good place for friends gathering.
Food was food but abit costly.
Overall okie and pleasant
5
Smoked duck rolls, salmon and other delicious treats with awesome tea and atmosphere! Best high tea!

This place is more for ladies to have lunch or high tea with their female friends, and the setting is genteel and artful. The food is well prepared and presented, though portions could be bigger (from a guyâ€™s point of view). I had the chicken and waffle and it was pretty good. However, having the tossed salad on top meant that the chicken was not as crispy as it could be. The iced lychee tea was also refreshing and I enjoyed the three lychees on a stick as well as the two biscuits.Service was pretty good, and friendly

We decided to dine here on a lark as all the interesting looking restaurants (such as Ippudo) were crowded. The menu looked promising but failed to live up to expectations.For dinner, you can choose either the 2 course set for $38 or the 3 course for $48. Not being dessert fans, each of us had the 2 course. Starters: The seafood mushroom broth in a teapot was surprisingly fragrant and flavourful. The pan-seared duck foie gras (+ $3) was also good, but not much else on the plate save for some thinly shredded green apples.Mains: The squid ink linguine and octopus was also well executed, as was the herb-crusted cod fish (+ $5). The only comment is the size of the portions - not nano-sized in some wannabe high end restaurants wanting to look cool, but certainly too small. I went away feeling a tad peckish and as if we had not received good value, which is a pity as the food was quite good.Then there were the teas, coffees etc. They are overpriced. We had the ginger spiced tea with whiskey ($14.50) which served two, which was nice - but again, it was rather pricey.And do note the restaurant ("tea boutique") does not serve water, not even tap. We wanted warm water but they would not serve it, not even for a price ($0.50? $1?) You must order still or sparkling bottled water, if you are to drink anything other than their very expensive teas and coffees ($11 up). I find restaurants with such a "policy" such a turn off, I never dine again. It's one thing to charge paying customers a nominal fee for tap water (boiled or not); it's quite another to force them to order your expensive bottled water.On a final note, service was slow and patchy. Some were students who obviously had no clue about basic server etiquette. The chap who seated us looked hesitant and reluctant when we pointed to a four seat table, even though the restaurant was not crowded, and there were other parties of the sane size (2) similarly seated. Nor was there a simple thank you after we settled the bill.A nice novelty which is worth trying once, but only once
4
We had a relaxing afternoon tea here after Long day of shopping at Orchard. The afternoon tea for 2 is so worth it!
3
Had the signature tea set for two with roasted dandelion tea and honey lavender tea. Value for money. Savoury dishes were good however the desserts were a little too sweet. Sweet potato fries we had was also on the salty side. Ambience is nice tho.
4
Here for a birthday celebration with a close girlfriend and they kindly let us have a cosy corner seat. Lychee tea & Earl Grey Lavender tea is recommended along their high tea set for 2! Great place to relax after a day of shopping.
5
Great dining experience for afternoon tea on a rainy day :) Decor and atmosphere was nice and comfortable, and service was excellent. We had the afternoon tea set for 2- the savory and sweets were proportioned just nicely. Definitely recommended!
3
Foods are average. Nice ambience but lightings could have been improved. A friend provides lighting design consulting service at Lightbox pte ltd. You might wanna contact them.
5
Very good food and tea, very relaxed and joyful experience. Recommend everyone come here. 5 star experience!
4
Every dish has rocket leaves. Kind of overdose on it. Sweet potato fries, the smoked duck wrap and soba were good.
5
Great presentation of food and drinks. Nice ambience and would love to come back to this place again.
4
The ambience is nice. I had the lychee tea with gelato and the tea is good. Good place to relax after shopping.
5
I've spent a lovely one and a half hours here. The ambience is soothing and relaxing, perfect for an afternoon high tea. The real flowers added a touch of nature in an otherwise modern establishment. The subtle Christmas decorations brought about a thoughtful air in the place. The food tenderized my tastebuds and the smooth tea complimented it wonderfully. Thank you for the pleasant experience
5
Great food, great prices! The tea set was marvellous with a combination of sweet and savoury. Highly recommended!
3
Located at the heart of orchard, good food and drinks. Prompt service. Highly recommended to travellers.

Great ambience for gathering with small group of frens.. interesting variety of tea. response time from staff could hv been improve considering not a very huge crowd during this dining time.gd presentation of food
5
Very good food with excellent service and wonderful ambience. Wide range of wonderful brunch dishes with even greater selection of coffees and teas. Definitely worth the visit.
5
Amazing food as always with impeccable service and a great ambience! Perfect for couples and group visits. A wonderful way to step away from the hustle and bustle of Orchard Rd.
5
We had Salmon Wellington and Duck Confit Sandwich and it was amazingggg! Highly recommended for brunch lovers!
4
Went over for a dinner gathering with a friend. Food is served with 20 mins & the tea was awesome. We had ginger spice tea with mao shan wang & lychee tea with lychee gelato. The ginger tea is more of cinnamon taste than the ginger. Tried the waffle with chicken cutlet. Well it tasted ok only. We loved the loveboat.. the pastry outside & tomato soup with lots of seafood is very tasty
4
Ordered high tea set for 2 with 2 type of drinks..lovely tea as usual, quite surprise with the cookies which came with the tea, hebihiam flavor! Surprisingly taste good and love the lemon cookie... for the high tea, flavourly savory but so so on the cakes on the se
3
Food is nice but portion is too little for that price level. Service staff seem abit too shorthanded to handle the crowd.
5
Ambience is amazing. Service staff well trained! Excellent and convenient location. Will come here again.
5
Nice ambience with a quaint selection, was here for a birthday celebration. Lychee tea is awesome! There is also a section for canvas painting if you'd like to get your fingers busy
5
Excellent food and ambience for all occasions.
Had a birthday celebration here in Nov and was a pleasant experience
4
Overall a nice place. However, I think the menu should include more items suitable for pregnant women.
5
Thoroughly enjoyed the ambience at Arteastiq. We had a delicious high tea and the fruit tea was so good, we like it a lot! We will definitely be back to try other food on the menu.
5
The food was excellent and delicious tea. Ambience is fantastic. We enjoyed it so much! Great outing place or birthday celebration.
4
The place had a nice decor with all these fancy teas that have different functions (from relaxing to detox). Although a bit pricey but it was still nice.
3
The ambience is great! The food is normal but it could be the selection that we chose. Some of the items on the menu looks good but we have not tasted yet so save them for a next visit

Was looking for a quiet yet classy place for business catch-up on a weekday afternoon. The place was quiet, only a handful of tables were filled.Took a while to be assigned a table even though business was slow. As there was a number of unoccupied window seating facing Takashimaya, requested for a change to that spot. Was told those are strictly for 3 persons, as there were only 2 of us, could not accommodate our request. When our tea sets were served, one was served with milk the other with honey. Unfortunately, the person who ordered the set with milk was lactose intolerant, she requested to change from milk to honey. The staff told us abruptly that honey costs an additional $2! No changes will be entertained. What a mismatch of ambience vs service, all this in the heart of Orchard Road!
5
Highly recommending the seafood high tea!! It’s a must try 😬
I came with my girlfriend and we order the seafood high tea. It comes with two choose of tea~ both are very refreshing.
3
Very nice place to meet up with friends, beautiful and quiet ambience for a weekday afternoon, nice and yummy food, light or heavy. Easily accessible via train or public transport.

Nice ambience, great food & service here. Highly recommended for he tea especially. There’s also an art jamming session that customers can jam art to.
5
we enjoy the hi tea set and ice lychee tea here.simply enjoyable and yummy on a monday afternoon.it is also my hubby 1st time here and he really enjoys the atmosphere too.
4
So lucky to get seats for 4 without reservation! The food was great and the ambience too. The tea selection is great and unique. 👍🏻👍🏻🙏🏻 🤗
3
Good place and ambiance to have afternoon tea. Plenty of choices for tea to choose but furniture n furnishing are old, standard for food especially the signature high tea set has dropped as compared with my last visits few years ago.
5
It's good to enjoy here and better book reserved during weekends. The atmosphere and servings are quite nice all's.
4
I love the ambiance, food & tea except that ac wasnt working properly. I love the modern aesthetic with birdcage and all. I ordered the black rice salad, which I highly recommend. Also the bangers & Mash.You can also do painting while waiting for ur food
5
Ordered the seafood high tea set at $98++, food quality was excellent and service was brisk! Good value for two

3
Went for the afternoon tea reservation for seafood Set. Food is nice for 2 persons.
Window seats during afternoon was hot with afternoon sun. Would recommend inside seating during afternoon.
We ordered some ala cart and table is small.
Not suitable for children.
4
This is the 1st time I tried Arteastiq and it didn’t disappoint. The food doesn’t come cheap but with the ambience and company on a lazy weekend afternoon, it is still acceptable. Give a try on Arteastiq today!!
5
Excellent place with nice ambience and food. Highly recommended the salted egg yolk capellini.Definitely will come back again!
5
Great place for a lazy afternoon for hi tea and catching up with Frds. Great food, ambience and service
5
The food was fresh, properly prepared and a great value for the price. We highly recommend the lychee tea. The high tea set was equally as good. 
Service is nice but a bit slow.
5
Nice environment with good food! Will definitely come back again.. and try other outlet. Good good good

I've never faced so many rejections in one sitting. Asked to be seated first before the rest arrives (the restaurant was not even 10% filled), asked for extra cups for tea, asked to purchase extra bread, asked for a water glass â€“ and all we got was a no, much to our amusement. Understandably the restaurant has protocols to follow and this was by no means reflective of the service standard - the service staff were mostly sweet and attentive.The restaurant setting was comfortable and picturesque. Food was average, at best. We had the allergory of love - chicken waffles, rage of the spartans - arrabiata stew, la quesadilla, buoyance - mango and coconut cremeux, as well as lyche tea. That aside, the lychee tea was great tasting and soothing enough to placate some of our displeasures. Many thanks to the waitress (many thanks Ms Christine) for her patience in helping my friends set up a birthday surprise for me too! Overall, not mind-blown but would not mind coming back again
5
Nice atmosphere where you can see orchard street where shoppers walking busily from the big window. Green tree tops outside the window, feeling rejuvenated seeing sunshine upon. A number of variety of tea and coffee, brunch menus.
5
Great place, nice food, good services by the staff. Nice high tea set, together with ice cold pomelo tea for the afternoon
4
pleasant place, great ambience, suitable for small grp gatherings. i hope they can serve free water cause it’s chargeable at five dollars per bottle... tea is good though.
5
The tea for 2 set is wonderful and the lychee tea is refreshing. Would definitely recommend this cafe to friends.
4
Calming place to have brunch at amidst the busy lifestyle. Food was good and amazing ambience. Highly recommend.

Amazing crab cake and lychee tea is delicious as always~ Tried the cold tea instead of the hot one today and it’s as good :)
4
Good ambiance with soothing music , coffee & pasta is good. Great place to spend a lazy afternoon 😊
5
The Food here is amazing and with a very cost and comfortable ambiance. Very good for groups and couples to come here to relax and have a good meal. The macaroons here are really good too.
5
Seafood high tea was awesome, but a little understaffed and had to wait for service. The dessert teas are worth tryinf
4
I ordered main course ribeye which is quite nice especially the sauce.
But high tea set need to be improved.

Tea is very nice, excellent place for gathering & photo shooting, friendly staff, great service :) :)

Nice food and I love the environment here
Have been here for so many times !!
I love the oyster and ice cream here :)
1
TLDR; Great tea, bad seafood, barely passable service.Visited here just this late afternoon/evening (22 Oct) for dinner.As a previous reviewer noted, this outlet seems slightly understaffed as we had to wait a while at the entrance before being served even though the restaurant was about half full. So our experience started off with a bit of a hitch here.We started off with a honey lavender tea and a Lady Yang (lychee tea + ice cream). These were pretty good, which was to be expected from the price (~12-14 dollars for drinks). For starters, we had a mushroom seafood broth and some oysters. The broth wasn't much to shout about and had a few measly pieces of seafood. Interesting concept though(the broth is served out of a teapot). Oysters were a travesty - they were overly briny(super salty actually) plus poorly cleaned with bits of grit still left in the shell. "Well this is a brunch place, not a seafood joint", so we should cut them some slack right?My wife had a sweet potato salad with burrata. This was not too bad - burrata was firm enough to have bite and the seasoning was just right. Sweet potato was not really sweet but passable. For my main, I had the squid ink linguine with octopus which seemed really eye catching from the menu photos. Unfortunately, the dish fell far short of expectations - linguine was slightly too dry (quite impressive, given that they had already added saffron cream), and the octopus was undercooked with a briny centre. I had to leave some parts uneaten as they were too slimy.  The kicker though, was the service at the end of the meal. Usually, when we eat at places that give Amex dining discounts, the server would factor it into the bill automatically or raise any potential issues with the bill once the card is passed on. However, when I received the bill for signing, I noticed that no discount was given, and asked if this was accurate. The server noted that I had ordered a 2 course dinner set for myself which made the bill ineligible for the Amex dining discount. I then requested that we then change the set order to the equivalent order for 2 ala carte items (btw, this would have resulted in a higher bill for the restaurant before discount). The server cheerfully refused the request and added that I should have mentioned that I would be using the Amex card at the start of the meal. Fair enough, we had another appointment to get to, so I decided to sign the bill and leave.Some time after the meal, I checked the T&Cs for Amex that was brought up by the server. I was appalled to find that even if the dinner set was not eligible for the discount, all other ala carte food items are supposed to be given a 15% discount. Dishonesty is a cardinal sin in most industries, and I think it's fair to highlight this as a huge demerit point for the restaurant (or perhaps it was just that server). Really left a bad taste in my mouth.In summary, I think this place is great to chill out at if you only ordered the teas (and maybe cakes, heard they were decent), but don't expect good food otherwise and certainly do not order any seafood. Also if you are planning to use a card discount here, don't expect the staff to take any initiative to highlight potential gotchas or to be honest with the T&Cs
3
The place is pretty but if you do not book you cannot expect a table by the window. 50% of the table were empty but i had to stay behind.Staff is not efficient. they do not check your needs.The food is just average. shrimp and pasta were too cooked. perhaps i was not lucky.but i get 10% didcount thanks to this commen
5
First time customer with very positive experience. Ambiance is very niche and food is worth the price. The tea is very unique which is worth the next visit! Surely will recommend this to my family and friends and i will patronise more of Arteastiq very soon
5
Best tea in town, nice food with cosy environment, recommended pear & lychee teas!!! Reasonable price !!!
5
Very nice place to dine at. good ambience and beautiful table and chairs :) :) :) :) :) :) the price was reasonable too

Nice atmosphere and good service. Really loved the desserts and aesthetics. Definitely would recommend to my friends.

Brought baby for a special treat at Arteastiq Mandarin Gallery. She loves it, both her Lavender Honey tea n Prince of xxx Sandwich. I had my favourite Lychee tea n Spartan Stew. 👍
5
Prawns were delicious, and staff were very helpful. Fresh ingredients, and nice plating arrangement. Highly recommended to all coming to the Somerset area!!
5
Foods are nice... we came for hi-tea and the set was tasty... friendly staff as well... highly recommend...
4
Excellent teas, nice atmosphere in a special decor.
I come here every time I am on visit in Singapore.
Will be back!
4
Staffs here are very polite, Had a signature high tea set and ordered an additional ala-carte dish (salmon black rice roll) from the Brunch menu. Everything taste good. The teas here are amazing as well. Good place!
5
I was very lucky to happen to find this nice cafe while I was wandering around in Mandarin Orchard. The atmosphere is very stylish, Romantic, and relatively quiet (maybe because it’s kinda hard to find). The Variety of tea’s they have, is very wide spread (there’s really a lot!), and the dishes & desserts are really nicely decorated (Artistic). I think it’s perfect for couples for a relaxing tea time, or friend gatherings. マンダリンオーチャードの最上階にあるお洒落なカフェでした。場所が奥まっているためか、余り人はいませんでした。店内はとってもスタイリッシュでお洒落な雰囲気！（センスが良い）名前の通り、料理もデザートも飲み物も一々見た目がartisticでお洒落！カップルや女子会におススメです
5
All the food are well prepared and nice. There is salty food and sweet in high tea. And the salmon is in a small cup,sausage wrapped in a small piece of pancake，foiegras , macaron. You can feel how much effort they took for each little thingIt will be better if you hire more staff, because I have come twice, I wait Long at the door side for Long
5
Soba Salad. Taste as good as it looks! Try the lychee tea tooo.... highly recommended. Love the environment and scenery.
5
My friends and i were chilling at this tea house and the savory and sweet pastries were just delectable and their lychee tea absolutely light and refreshing. Thumbs up.
4
We visited Arteastiq Boutique Tea House at Mandarin Gallery for dinner. The food we ordered was good and yummy. Liked the lychee iced tea the most.
5
Great high tea set, great combination of savoury and sweet light food. And very nice presentation. Great selections of tea.
5
Extremely satisfied with the tea and food too !!! Like most shops in mandarin gallery you have to 'look' for it . Once you find it , you will love it
4
Great Ambience & great place to chill! It will be good to have more variety of choices for the high tea set and as well as the main menu...
5
I love their wide range of tea selections and creative tea desserts.
Brunch menu is good too.
The art jamming studio next door is a fantastic idea!
Perfect for girls gathering, or simply a solo soul searching experience.
5
A go to place for the best tea in Singapore and loving the atmosphere there. A great place for a good catch-up!
4
Our waiter Abu was extremely helpful in giving us recommendations for dinner and was very attentive to our needs. The cod is good but the pomelo salad average. All in all good. Ambience is nice!
4
Dinner for two was a pot of warm lychee tea to start with, followed by the egg yolk cappellini with cocktail shrimps, and angus steak with sweet potato chips. The tea is a must-try. A lovely place to while away the evening. It makes for quite a quiet and romantic date too :
3
Nice ambience, strategic location, nice view if you get the window seat. Food is average. Lighting was not as good. We could not take nice pictures..............
4
Love the ginger spiced tea with rum and the ambience is perfect for group gathering. Serving crew is professional and polite.
5
Came to try the signature teasary set with my gf and it certainly lived up to our expectations. Desserts were elegantly displayed and there was a wide selection of tea to choose from. Tasted really good too! At only $48++, def worth it(:
5
Ordered the seafood high tea, which had a pretty good selection of seafood including a tasty lobster with otah filling. Ambience was great for a chill afternoon talk chit chat with the family
4
Here for the high tea set for 2 and we had their dessert of the day (very 👍). The food are alright, tea and the ambience is fantastic.
4
The ice lychee tea is the best, the food was okay. The only disappointment was that the waitress refused to give us window seat even though there were couple of vacant seats available.
3
Quiet place to have small group meet up. Huge varieties of tea to choose. Had dinner with Husband. 😊😊
5
Lovely and pleasant tea house with a comprehensive tea menu and afternoon tea sets. Salad is creative and tasty. Nice place to relax after a long day of shopping on Orchard Road.
5
We had the deluxe teasury with lots of pleasent surprises in each food item! Service was excellent with amicable smiles!
4
Enjoy the tea & the ambience, nice song feel relax plus the nice view from the place we sit...... Service crew are very attentive & well manners. Sitting down here enjoy the tea close eyes listen to the music will make your body relax and your brain cell will just freeze for this moment.
5
Second visit here. Friendly service, good food. Nice ambience with good photo taking spots. Ordered the high tea set for two and added some sides, good for three pax. No reservation but walk ins are entertained.
5
The food is nice and the service is good. The ice cream is very unique. The salmon Wellington is highly recommended, and the lychee tea is our all time favorite
5
the ribeye steak is frangrant and viva duck is delicious. the spacious setting also allowed for my wife and child to chill and relax while watching the busy street of orchard road. a great way to enjoy a Sunday lunch.
4
nice ambiance for meet-ups, great fruit teas and coffee, awesome location, friendly staff, wide variety of choices for food and drinks!

4
We had a nice dinner @ Arteastiq, the name spells out this restaurant is a new concept combining Art workshop together with nice ambience and nicely touched food!We ordered 2 courses set dinner, start is great serving with Mashroom Soup served in tea port and taste outstanding! Main course we had black ink pasta, taste good with fresh squid. Wagyu Ribeye were prepared with medium cooked. One comment will be not to do too much butter oil on the plate.Overall is a awesome experience and we look forward to come back again! Maybe we will try out breakfast next time!
4
Interesting concept of marrying painting & food. One section of the cafe are set up with individual canvas for painting, while the other side for the cafe. Our seats were next to the windows, overlooking the intersection to Takashimaya. Unfortunately it was evening, not much things to see. The seats are comfortable & the ambience is great for afternoon tea.All the tea we ordered are good. The desserts are excellent and the food presentation are very artistic. But the main dishes are just average.Overall, this is a great place for afternoon teas with friends. But it is very popular on weekends, make sure you make reservation early
5
Great! This is a great restaurant and tea house do come check it out! Nice lychee tea and nice oyster
4
Ambience was good! Wagyu beef was fantastic tho! The sauce complimented the meat and it was just wonderful!
5
Serves very good tea especially the fruit tea are served with sides and affordable Hightea. Enjoy it very much having high tea with my girlfriend.
5
A perfect place for a coffee date or tête-à-tête with your friends. One of the best coffee served in town and of course they have other spectacular drinks as well.
Great ambience and I highly recommend this place! 😊
5
absolutely delicious food, value for money! :)
duck confit sandwich was one of the best i've ate so far!
5
This is my second time visit arteastiq for high tea...nice environment with nice and well presented foods...I love it
5
Awesome! Would return! Salmon wellington was generous in portion and delicious. Drinks were innovative and well-paired
4
Very nice environment for high tea with your girlfriends. Reasonable price with nice decoration. The fruit tea is really refreshing!
5
We had an enjoyable time at Arteastiq. Initially we were worried that we might not get a seat due to the weekend policy but the staff especially Eden was very helpful in assisting us in our numerous requests! The ambience is lovely and the tea set divine too! Will definitely be back.
4
Passed by Arteastiq several times and finally book dinning as we felt the ambience is classy.We ordered set dinner, starter is pomelo salad and seafood broth. The pomelo salad is not exactly green as it's mainly black rice. Black rice is expensive and good for health so that's alright. We love the seafood broth. The twist is the seafood broth is really more mushroom than seafood. Mushroom haters beware, but hurray for mushroom lovers :)Main course we opt for ink squid spaghetti and the cod. Ink squid spaghetti was above par as compared to other ones we had before. The spaghetti came with a squid tentacles, fresh and chewy. Cod was normal however the skin is specially seared with herbal which makes it stand out.Ended with a white chocolate cake (dessert of the day) which is great and not overly sweet. We are considering coming for high tea next time as the dessert menu looks awesome.Btw the service is excellent and staffs are courteous and attentive. Cheers
4
Love the interior & its uniqueness at this cozy boutique tea shop :) recommended to anyone looking for a good conversation spot while shopping in the Orchard Area :)
4
Nice chillax place for afternoon tea and their brunch are nice. Spent hours here, enjoy chatting and taking photos.
5
Great ambience, awesome tea! Advised to visit the shop only at non-peak hours or ranged around 2-4pm.
4
Came early for brunch and food is good, red date oolong tea is particularly impressive and a soothing feel. Recommended if you want to have a relaxing brunch
4
Great afternoon tea set as well as dinner with family would recommend for friends afternoon tea or dinner with parents
4
Great place for team bonding! Good place, good vibes, good drinks. Service is prompt, will recommend to everyone.
3
I definitely recommend visiting the place once, they have a large choice of tea.... Also food options. I tried the afternoon tea, which came with a few small canapÃ©s and sweets. The Earl Grey lavender tea was very tasteful, but the food somewhat a disappointment.... Pretty average and not so flavourful.On the other hand the staff are very nice, and responsive
4
We came here for a brunch - had chocolate truffle tea, iced chocolate , duck confit sandwich, soba salad & chicken waffles. The tea was so unbelievably delicious & the food tasted fabulous . We were very pleasantly impressed! Service given was friendly & thoughtful as well
4
Had tea with a friend at this nice little place on the 4th level of Mandarin Gallery. It was a weekday and the place was almost empty. There was an outdoor seating area but we chose to sit indoor. Furniture was comfortable and the place tastefully decorated, although it can look quite cramped as they try to maximize the space usage. Service was good, staff was pleasant, and the atmosphere relaxing. We had tea (the lychee tea was superb and refreshing) and chatted for more than 2 hours, the staff just left us alone and did not hurry us off. Overall, a very good place for catching up with friends over tea and snacks. For an upmarket place, the price here is very reasonable, especially if you consider the service and ambience of the place. Highly recommended
5
A special day to mark a special occasion with my love one. Having to dine in great dinner and very cosy environment. Staff are friendly and conscientious. Strongly encourage tourists and locals to come and enjoy this nice boutique teahouse.Calming and relaxed.. suit for couples and family.
4
Nice food nice environment and price are reasonable . Drinks are nice and well prepared . Good place to hang out
5
The food was great and the service exceeds my expectation. The view is great too.
Will definitely be back soon.
4
Looking for a dating place to go to? Arteastiq is definitely a very romantic place for night out, and is reasonably price too
3
Wide selection of tea, good ambience for tea time with friends/ family however do not expect great service
5
The food and ambience are splendid! Staff are well mannered and friendly as well. It's a really good place for a chill afternoon tea & we will definitely be back here again.
5
Excellent food and service!
Must try deserts and tea!
The stranger's poetry-matcha cheesecake is my Favourite.
4
Came for the afternoon tea. Very nice ambience. Staffs are very friendly and food are good. The selection of teas is wide and delectable - definitely try the lychee tea! Will come back again.
5
My favourite cafe in Singapore! This is Second time visited! Located at the Orchard center area, nice views!!! only $48 hi tea set for 2 pax is value with good foods!

Lychee tea and red dates oolong tea were refreshing. Food were hearty and filling. Ambience was fantastic and chill.

Everything else we experienced whilst staying at the Mandarin Orchard Hotel had been at a consistently high standard so our lunch at Arteastiq was disappointing. The worst aspect was the inattentive service... and we were billed incorrectly. Their floors and tables are not up to Singapore standards (see photos). I didn't request the 10% discount offered for posting this TripAdvisor review
4
Interesting tea and chocolate concoctions (loved the Whisky Cioccolata), the crabcake brioche and salted egg spaghetti were especially good. Service got a bit uneven though; while generally quick and attentive, sometimes the quickness was a bit too curt and turned some friends off.
4
Good location in the heart of Orchard, with an art jamming studio next door - perfect way to spend an afternoon. Great ambience with very cool decor. Food was very well presented. Beverages were well created.
4
$48 high tea set for two. Definately Value for money with nice food, great ambience, cant wait to have a second visit again. Thumbs up!!!
5
The staff were extremely warm and friendly! Service was also prompt. The place is well decorated and fit for a relaxing afternoon tea session.
5
The food and beverages are nice! We really enjoy the service and also its ambience. My favorite is lychee ice tea and octopus salad.
4
Came for my favourite lychee tea, food menu and quality is decent. Good view with high ceiling. friendly staff.
3
Nice cozy quiet place.
Food presentation is very good, however, place is a bit unclean so are the cutleries, cups and sofas.
Could have been better
Food should give flexible options for allergic/ intolerance people.
5
My short vacation in Singapore and found out this place at Mandarin Gallery! Had a great brunch with my buddy before leaving Singapore. We ordered octopus salad, farmer's breakfast, lobster soup and french rose tea! Great food and great place for brunch and love the french rose tea! We proceed to a painting session which is just next to Arteastiqa! TGISunday
5
The ambience is quiet, nice for relax. There are different variety of the tea. Foods are delicious with nice presentation. Especially the mushroom seafood soup, squid ink linguine with Octopus and the barley with lobster main course.Staffs are attentive and friendly too.Only have one suggestion is the portion can be bigger :
4
It was my first time here and it was introduced by my friend. We had Crepe and teas. The crepe was served in about 5 minutes after we ordered. The chamomile teas was served after about 15 minutes and the chai tea latte was served longer. The quality of the food was ok for its price. But i must say that the presentation of the food and tea was superb.
3
First visit. Ordered the tomato stew and flight fantasy, food was alright. Had the wrong tea served but it was decent.
5
Good ambiance with excellent food. The teas never disappoint! Good place for catching up with friends with good service. Thumbs up!
5
The Arteastic Tea experience never disappoints. Been coming here for teas, always a good experience. Food is excellent as well! Thumbs up!

4
Ordered duck confit sandwich with sweet potato fries and a soup. Both dishes are lovely. So were the tea we got. ambience is great too. Friendly staff.

5
This is the 2nd time we come to Arteastiq in a month.. we're always satisfied! A good experience for high tea session!
5
My Friend and I met here for a leisurely and luxurious afternoon tea. The tea didn't disappoint. Light and aromatic is the tea, served in delicate crystal teapots. The high tea treats are also refined and elegantly presented. Good value for the amount we paid.
5
Tried their lychee tea which was their signature tea and it was very good and reasonable priced for $48 for 2 for afternoon high tea.
4
Nice food and tea during their noon tea time .. Especially their bread basket taste so good. Will definitely come back again, to try out other dish
5
The place is really good to chill. I went with my friends. We ordered high tea, strongly recommend lychee tea(ice) it was awesome!!! Will visit again ☺️
4
Food is great! I love their lychee tea! Came here a few times and overall a pleasant experience. Ambience is good and service is great! Recommended to everyone
4
Food was good, ambience was great and comfortable. We had the steak and the sausages, coupled with the irish coffee. Fantastic! Will definitely come by again.
1
Wanted to book in for high tea so rung up on the phone and they said they don't take reservations and to come in any time. Arrived at 1.30pm and they then told us high tea is not until 2.30pm (no where written on their website or automated text they send, or mentioned on the phone)!! Asked if we could have the tea that comes with our high tea set in the meantime whilst waiting for food and they said no we had to wait for an hour it could only come with our food. Then said they didn't do high tea for 3 people, you have to order a set for 2 people. So don't bother if you have an odd number of people!! Rude staff, and very inflexible and unaccommodating. So many better places to go to over this one for high tea. Wont be back
4
Food is very delicious especially the spaghetti. Good place to visit if looking for a place to relax with nice food
4
Delicate food and good location. Some

Awesome tea and wonderful place to relax. It would be nice to try both the pomelo and lychee tea. They are refreshing.
5
Good drinks and nice atmosphere to just chill and have drinks with friends and yeah that's about it.
5
Great place for tea with friends, or to spend a quiet afternoon with a book. Tea sets look beautiful, with cookies on the side. Would recommend the lychee tea, quesadilla and Boston love boat. Very friendly service as well!
5
This is my second time here. Love this place a lot. Was here both time for high tea after a tiring shopping day. Do book in advance as the place is always full and might need to queue a bit.
5
Nice ambiance , tasty food and friendly staffs, convenient access and we had a great time dining here. Will definitely be back again .
5
Arteastiq is always my favourite cafe on off days. It's located in the heart of busy orchard that is easy to get to and this particular boutique setup gives an excellent atmosphere.The glass shop front facing orchard road also offer spectacule to the face of Singapore, both in the day and night
4
Great place to paint a picture and dine
I would recommend my friends to come and enjoy
Great ! Happy place

Lovely atmosphere with tasty food! Must try when in Singapore. Nice selection of teas to choose from. Place to bring the family or to hang out with girlfriends.
5
My girl-friend and I have enjoyed ourselves tremendously. With lovely ambience and friendly staff. We are so lucky to get the window seats! (-: have a good time there y'all!
5
I had an amazing time at Arteastiq today. My Favourite item here is the pomelo tea (cold)! I ordered the lychee tee, pomelo tea and the 2pax tea set for $48.
5
Love the Irish cream coffee that pairs well with the delicious French toast.
Kudos to the excellent service by one of the staff who made the visit a really pleasant one 😊
4
My boyfriend and I visited for a late Sunday brunch. The atmosphere was pleasant and the food was presented beautifully! They offer an extensive selection of unique teas which we didn't try but the table next to us recommended. We ordered four plates, including the chicken and waffles which were good. The waffle was slightly too dense for us, however, the chicken was juicy and delicious. Must try: Sweet potato Truffle fries - they were amazing!!!
5
Fantastic modern tea service with extra touches of elegance, all served on a plank!. Glass teapot with paper-band wrapper, cookies on the side. Clove stick + candied orange. Wow! It knocked my socks off.The Salmon Wellington here was wonderful; best meal I had in Singapore
5
It's decent place with good variety of teas and dessert. Good place to mix around with friends for tea time.... I love it and really recommend this place....
5
A great place to catch up with friends over tea. I will definitely come here again the next time for their specialty lychee tea, paired a sides of biscuits! The ambience is really cozy, and I believe you definitely love it too!
4
Nice ambience and affordable desserts to chill out with friends.. Cute, helpful, polite waiter and waitresses! :)
4
This is my first visit at this restaurant. We try 2 course dinner after working and really like the cod!
5
High tea was perfect with iced lychee tea. Service was good with waiter's recommendation of Boston Love Boat
5

4
Food was okay, tea was nice. Will probably come again. A nice day out with my Daughter! Should try the lychee and pomelo tea.
4
Good food and environment.Waiter are friendly.We ordered a fruit tea and it was slightly sweet and we request to have warm water to dilute it. But they dont serve warm water at all. Even I want to pay, they also don't serve.Would like to suggest they review it. How much can it cost to serve warm water?Thank you
4
The food that we ordered tasted very nice. Especially the Wagyu rib-eye and the foie gras.
Ambience was also nice. Not crowded for dinner on weekday. Good and attentive service too!
4
Lovely evening with my wife and she loves it. Not overly crowded and the ambience is nice. Will be back again.
5
Excellent hot/iced lychee tea and quesadilla.
Good service with good ambience for relaxing and chilling out.
5
Talk about decadent lifestyle, a meal here will spoil you to bits. A wide array of tea selections addition to their unique salted flavoured dishes. Just exquisite.
5
Good food and service! Come during 3pm for brunch, there is space and you don't have to make reservation! Enjoyed the time here at Arteastiq!
3
The tea selection was very impressive. A great range of fruit teas, and ginger teas. The teasery set was a little limited, but the food was good. Would definitely come back here with friends the next time!
5
A super awesome place to chill out and have quality food, drinks and chat with your friends and love one ..
4
Friendly and helpful staff, highly recommended for high tea with friends. We took their $48 afternoon tea set- comes with 2 speciality tea and light bites.
4
Red date oolong tea is nice. There are very wide variety of teas too
Boston Love Boat is fantastic !! We are one and ordered a second! Highly recommended
4
This place offers a good value tea set in the heart of the city with a nice ambience. We enjoyed the lychee tea and the rose tea and would come back again!
5
Nice ambience. Food is fantastic. Well decorated. Lychee tea is smooth and fragrance. Suitable for friends and couple to enjoy their tea time
5
adequate space for an afternoon weekend high tea place. high tea set a bit sad but ok food quality still ok.
5
Located in a nice and cosy corner in Mandarin Gallery. Perfect for a relaxing high tea. Love the pear tea and lychee tea! Good service too! :)
5
Nice ambience for family gathering. Food is beyond awesome too! Will definitely come back again on my next visit to Singapore. All of us enjoyed our time here in arteastiq boutique tea house
5
My wife & I enjoyed our tea break here at Arteastiq. We ordered the Lady Yang & Captain Buntan. They were awesome. The ice cream was not too sweet and the chilled tea was awesome.
Thank you, Arteastiq! :)
5
Nice view and beautiful interior. The tea sets were interesting and nicely presented.
Would recommend for desserts and tea. Food is not highly recommended.
5
Service was excellent. Ambience of the place was perfect for photo-taking, and not to mention, the place serves a myriad of unique teas, which offers a sensory experience to tea lovers like myself.
5
Good food and excellent services. Good brunch place. Worthwhile to pay a visit. Hazelnut coffee and the lychee tea is good.
5
Tucked away in a quiet corner of the Mandarin Gallery at level 4 is a gem... Nice ambience and decor, food was excellent. Will definitely drop by soon. Great for dates and small gatherings.
5
Me and my fiancé were really hungry and settled for Arteastiq since there was no queue when we arrived. I was pleasantly surprised by the cosy ambience, good food, love the fruit teas too. The service was excellent too. My fiancé even commented if he is not working on of the weekday, he will come here to drink tea and read a book.
5
Ordered the rose tea and was amazed by the aroma! Great service too! Very attentive staff with great knowledge on their menu! Will definitely visit again
4
Great ambience and food was good as well, especially the savoury items. Recommended for an affordable high tea in Town.
5
Delicious main courses! And paradise for tea lovers. Even better with discounts from eatigo 👍If you expect wine beer or strong alcohol this place is not for you.
5
A fabulous place to relax with a cuppa tea and an awesome view to people watch overlooking orchard road!
5
The high tea sets here are fantastic - especially the oysters! Love the ambience and the specialty drinks, the music is great too
5
I like the Ginger Ginseng tea the most with the tea set. The food under the signature tea set is refreshing too. A nice place for an afternoon tea with the love one.
5
Had an enjoyable brunch with my kids. Ordered Bronzino's Touch-Burrata Brunch and cold fizzy earl grey while kids had The Farmer's breakfast and dessert of the day, white chocolate mousse cheesecake, on top of cold chocolate and hot mint lemongrass tea. Waiter Eden was certainly helpful with all queries and even helped make reservation for my art jamming next door. Will be back again!
4
I came here on 17aug, perfect stop after nonstop shopping and walking, the weather was rainy and cold so i decided to order ginger spice tea here. Though I wish i had come earlier to try their afternoon tea and cake (It has ended ard 5pm). Would come again next time to try their chicken waffl
5
The specialty tea is a must try especially the ones with a scoop of Yuzu ice cream in it. The brunch is great and price wise is a sweet deal for sharing with friends on a lazy afternoon. Definitely the place to hang out for afternoon tea with your bffs
4
This is our first time here spending a cozy afternoon. A good and nice place to chat and catch up with friends. We had salmon wellington and the chicken and waffle dish - allegory of love as our mains. The chicken and waffle dish is one of our favourite as we love how the chicken was cooked. The pear tea was flavourful and not too sweet. Its a must try. We had the dessert - sweet endings was definitely a nice ending to our cozy afternoon
5
Nice ambience and great food. Service is good. Recommend for a relax brunch with love ones. Will be back for their afternoon tea.
5
Great tea! Try the lychee tea. Third time here! Great for all occasions. Lovely and friendly staff :)
5
A tea person, so i would always bring friends or family for some tea and desserts after dinner. Good tea premium selections too. recommended!
5
Good food, good atmosphere and good service. Have been to this place a few times and love it! Would recommend to all my friends :)
5
A great place for chill up ... hightea and meal. Cozy place and silent ... Do bring your friends along !! Never regret it !!
5
Nice and cosy place with great tea & coffee serve by friendly staffs. A great place to come after shopping... highly recommended and will come again.
5
After the usual delays of flights, we arrived in Singapore much later than anticipated. To stretch our legs and explore we headed to the Orchard Road area. Not feeling particularly hungry after all the food on the flight, we looked for somewhere interesting to have a drink. Being an avid fan of selective teas, this place seemed ideal. What a treat we were in for, the presentation, the taste and the variety on offer were excellent. This is a place not to be missed
4
Overall atmosphere is really a big WOW to me. I really like the overall design and the decorations. It's very classic and the colors combination were awesome. My date and i really liked it! Food wise were great also, just a bit overwhelmed by the amount of teas selections they have, not a bad thing though =) The brunch menu were impressive also and it even came along with a soup(Omg it's super delicious) and a nice cake.Overall i would say this place it's a easy 9/10. The only downside i can think of it's the pricing which can be a little expensive to some.
4
We came for tea time in arteastiq i think is very good. I enjoy with the warm greetings staff and food presentation. Taste good and we really enjoy. We had signature teasery for two person, sweet potatoes and ginger tea and biscotti, and dessert of today. All is good. Must try
4
We didn't try the desserts though they looked good. It was quite late when we patronized the place, it was quiet and the decor was soothing and a very suitable place for friends to share some quality time together without fear of not hearing what each of us was saying. And the staff was friendly. We ordered a few various pots of tea, I really liked Lychee Tea (hot) and Pomelo Tea (hot) although the accompanied piece of biscuits could be better. Average price per pot costs more than S$10 and some of the tea is not suitable for refilling, so depending on individual budget, this may and may not be the best option.Personally, will I visit the place again? Yes, I will, to try out the desserts and if the place remains suitable as a quiet hangout, I'd love to visit it again with friends
5
The best hi-tea I have ever tasted. Its a must visit when travellers come to singapore. 10/10
Theyv got brunch all day, deluxe teasery with savouries and sweets. Loved it!!
4
The place offers good food with good ambience.. A great place to chill out with your friends.. be prepared to spend 20$ and above per pax.
5
Had the sizzling earl grey and hazelnut chocolate, paired with a matcha cheesecake. Wonderful beverages and dessert to end the day. Will visit again *thumbs up*
4
Ordered the deluxe teasery for 2 pax at $38 each. Food is of good portion and variety. Scallop and foie gras was good. So was the prawn crackers with cheese. Savory dishes were more delicious than the desserts.
Overall good value for tea
3
We love this outlet here for its location and the dishes are yummy. But we think the service level can be improved further. We also hope there are more variety in the food menu for the main.
4
Nice high tea set for SGD48 per 2pax. Good for high tea Tks for big glass wall so not cold... so many tea selection.
5
Lovely atmosphere and delicious desserts! Try the iced lychee tea and iced pear tea, super refreshing!
5
A cozy place for a meeting with friends of mine, not to mention the food as well as drink are also worth it to try.
I ordered honey lavender tea, definitely will return again later.
Overall, it is very recommended to visit this tea house.
5
We scheduled a meeting with a customer staying in Mandarin Orchard hotel. Waiting for the appointment, we looked for a quiet place to have a drink and do our pre-meeting, we found Arteastiq in Mandarin Gallery. We liked it so much that we brought the customer back to Arteastiq for the meeting in a quiet corner of the cafÃ©.We tried different artisan teas and coffees. All the drinks offered something special. Good place. Busy but not noisy
4
Relaxing and refreshingNice environment and artistically presented refreshmentsRecommended for friends gathering to catch up or a quiet night outPleasant for tea time during the day. The warm ginseng ginger tea is lovely while the iced lychee tea has a balanced flavor of lychee and tea - not too sweet either which is good. Teas come with some light bites such as biscuits,biscotti or small treats.
4
Nestled in the heart of orchard road inside Mandarin Orchard hotel. This place has a fantastic ambience for an relaxed chat after dinner. Had a Fantastic Irish cream coffee with scope of gelato !
5
So smooth pudding and wonderful tea, I love it. Cheese toast is also very delicious. Service is also nice and considerate. We will recommend this tea home to our Chinese friends. Thanks.
5
Beautiful desserts, interesting tea choices. Small groups can sit by the window for a great view, be sure to have all your friends present if you're visiting on the weekends or else they will not allow entry.
4
Overall an enjoyable experience with friendly and attentive staff. Food was nice with a wide selection of teas. Lychee tea was good!
4
Great ambience for couple to dine on weekend afternoon. Food are good for high tea and not for lunch.
5
Birthday lunch with my friend. Presentation of food and tea is beautiful and very tasty! Off to do the art class! Surroundings very calm and relaxing.
3
High tea package was average. Requested for sofa seat but was been rejected due to 2 person. The foods were average. Will only drop by again if there discount of promotion.
4
Tried their lychee tea and chicken waffles, both are pretty good. I like the place, it is very relaxing. Would definitely come back again next time.
5
pretty good brunch and tea set
nice and very friendly staff here
the staff reminds and asks me to write a review to enjoy 10% discount for the total bill
good service and nice ambient for having a high tea with my mum
5
Staff are extremely helpful and friendly . Perfect window views during dates . Nice place to chill and quietly peaceful to enjoy my dining experience .
3
Had Tri Color Pasta and a cappuccino.The food was great but terrible service. Had to get up and call for service each time although no one was there in the restaurant.
3
Arteastiq Tea House is good for brunch and tea time, with quite a range of small bites. Very good the Burrata, but quite expensive. Nice selection of teas, which come with biscuits and might be refilled upon request.
5
Had their special for 2 tea-set with one of my close girlfriends and we enjoyed it thoroughly. Food was decent for the price and service was really fast and good.
4
A place where food and drinks are simply delicious! The male staff members were really friendly. Easy to speak to when asked for recommendations. My friends and i were there for tea.The only think i was super pissed was that nobody noticed that i was at the entrance waiting to be seated to our reserved seats. The kitchen staff pressed the bell i believe to indicate that there was someone at the entrance but nobody came. I decided to just walk into the place when my friend arrived
3
I have tried both the Plaza Singapura and a friend recommended Mandarin Gallery. Design wise, the Mandarin Gallery has a more intimate and cosy feel about it. The food was ok, the Bangers in Mash was not what us English know it to be. It’s the restaurants interpretation of putting a croquet together, a sausage wrapped in mash potato with a crispy outside. The seating could do with a good clean. What I found somewhat poor, is that window seats for 2 people were being used, however there were window seats for 4 people were only for a party of 4. So we were escorted to the dark and dingy alcoves (thank goodness for iphone torches!). Anyway, time passed and 3 hours later, not one group of 4 people turned up … and the window seats remained empty for the whole afternoon. The Mandarin Gallery itself was really really quiet - so I wondered what their thinking is to not allow two people to sit there, versus lets just have them empty!! It felt it was being a bit “precious” when why not just take a first-come first-serve approach with patrons!! Just because you only 1 friend then you are a second-class diner! The menu’s are inconvently A3 (ridiculous) boards and difficult to negotiate and read. If they are doing a play on the “art” theme (as they offer art classes), a menu in the shape of painting palette would likely be more useful. There wasn't even enough room to put it on the table !Service was fine enough - as long as you understood their system, which is the little Perspex box left on the table for calling the waiter, requesting the bill. The waiters could avoid the constant hand waving if they explained this to the patrons 
5
We spent the afternoon in the adjacent art studio ("art-jamming"), which is a marvellous way to relax and re-connect with oneself. Afterwards we had dinner. We all enjoyed the food. Most of us had 3 courses with wine. The herbal teas after were outstanding. Overall a great experience
4
A lovely place for afternoon tea. The set for two is great value at $48 . A set for one is available too .Great attention-to-detail on food and tea presentation .Loved it !Cosy ambience . If only the sofas by the window didn't get as hot in the afternoon , they will be ideal for people watching on Orchard road . Will be back 
4
Was here for brunch and we got a window seat. That was nice, looking out at the greenery. Love the Atlantic Dance - Octopus Salad (though I had better ones before) and the La Quesadilla was very well done (definitely restaurant standard). The lychee tea was supposed to be popular too. Tried it and it was truly excellent, though very very pricey at S$11.00, which you could get a nice dessert for a couple of bucks more. Pricing : Orchard Rd pricing. On the pricey side for mid-range food. Wifi : Yes, but not stableService: Average. Typically Singapore. Definitely not in alignment with the prices charged
2
Two good points about this place are overall ambience and my drink - lychee ice tea with ice cream.The rest of my experience was not as pleasant. Waffles was pretty dry and bland, soup slightly too salty and cake a tad too sweet.The seat I had was dirty with some crumbs which I had to sweep off before sitting. The restaurant wasn't crowded and it would be great if service staff could be more attentive to cleanliness
4
Well, I'd recommend this place for sure. Other than the fact that they provide art jamming sessions, the tea is simply exquisite.Ordered a seafood stew and lychee hot tea. I'm more impressed by the tea really.Refreshing, sweet and tastes absolutely like lychee!The seafood stew was slightly bland but tasted alright.Love how the food was presenting.Husband ordered a waffle chicken dish and it was not good... the chicken was a tad too dry and oily. There was nothing great about it except that it looked good.I suppose I'd be less disappointed if I was only there for tea :)But the tea was superb
5
had a nice brunch with a girlfriend. both of us get a set meal incuding a pot of tea of our choice. total charges on $40. which is a good deal.
4
Love the exquisite tea, strong coffee and beautiful displays of food. We shared the salted egg pasta, could have been too much for one person to finish the plate, but as a shared dish, it was great! Worth a heart attack!
4
Well prepared food in a delightful atmosphere with attentive staff. Highly recommended for afternoon tea.
3
Food is average and staff is not attentive when service is required. gd place for gathering and nice ambience & scenery.
3
Food is average. The milk tea is average. The restaurant looks pretty and is quiet, with lots of natural light.
3
Quite a number of tables were booked for a private function and we were given conflicting information from different wait staff about when to place our order. Eventually we were told to wait an hour for our food. You get the sense that they expected the customers to make up for their own lack of planning. We had to put our foot down before we were accorded to better service. A great pity about the service, because the ambience is great, especially when seated next to the window on a cloudy day. The food is delectable.
3
First time I'm visiting this place for high tea and it's really just mediocre. The tea set for 2 we chose was the $48 with 2 choice of drinks. The tray of items was really pathetic and puny. The photos show it. Plus I noticed the inconsistency in the serving of the tea items, other tables has sprinkled icing sugar on it but ours was bare! Seriously there's a quality control issue here. And I find there's no real value for $ at this place. If I wanted a real proper high tea I would recommend Landing point or Hyatt for high tea. Pay more for quality food and unlimited tea servings plus great service with a view. ( Landing Point). I won't return for high tea for sure.
5
Is located at Mandarin Gallery, it was a beautiful places for dating. Colourful Chairs is like a Art Cafe house . This cafe always Fully booked. If can pls make a reservation before you go there and window seat always taken. They served Lunch, High Tea & Dinner. Open every day.. wonderful place for high tea.

I really once liked arteastiq and wrote nice reviews and recommended it to many friends. But never again. Three of us came in for lunch on a weekday. It was pretty much empty which I am surprised as when I last visited, there was a really long queue. We each ordered the set lunch. I have no complaints about the food as it was fine. However, the staff service is very slow and took a long time to come even though the service bell was pressed a few times. As we sat and chatted, enjoying the environment and nice décor, we asked for hot water to refill tea. But the male staff said no, we do not do refill. So I asked if I can have a cup of hot water. He said no, we do not have hot water. I then asked, if I can buy hot water. He curtly told me that they DO NOT have hot water. I then said, how is it possible that you DO NOT have hot water when you serve tea? He just stared at me and shrugged. By this time, I was really annoyed and my friends pointed out that we had order 3 whole meals, so why was it difficult to even give or sell the hot water to us? I was really annoyed and upset with the service and attitude and definitely staff training is sorely lacking. The Manager should really look into this. Hot water isn't a big deal, but customer satisfaction is. I will certainly rate Terrible service and Terrible value, as arteastiq seems to place too high value on hot water
4
Good to go during weekdays such as Tues to Thurs night to be away from the crowd. Lovely ambience and staff was polite and helpful. Would recommend anybody to go there because their food were yummy. Ordered the Duck Confit and Short Ribs sandwich set meal. What are you waiting for.. just drop by there if can't decide what to eat
5
The atmosphere is great for couple and the standard of foods are definitely tip top!
Will be back for sure.
4
Food was great though i thought it was slightly pricey. Portion was big. Nice tables and seats. Location in ps is a bit hard to find
4
Good food just that the service was a bit slower than I would like. The buzzer that they placed on the table wasn't working either
4
Ambiance of the place was good and not too crowded. Order the pear tea and lavender tea which was different and nice. Food wise not so special which can do more.

We went there for lunch and was pleasantly surprised to find it being a very serene and quiet lunch place. The food was great (though a tad expensive). We'll be back to try the double teasery!
5
Staff was friendly, food was tasty, Paying for the entire experience. Good for gatherings. One of us had entertainer app and had a discount.

Was served by three different people (two males and one female) - service by the first male waiter whom i didnt manage to catch the name was terrible, no smiles, nothing. We asked if we could sit at the sofa as we would like to take pictures, we were given a zombie-fied expression saying "No, that's for four people.". The female waitress was better but did not inform us that the ice cream choices were available at the back of the menu - she just told us by mouth what flavours there were and did not mention the chocolate flavour has alcohol in it! Then came second male, Alvin, who was a saviour in this hopeless experience - we asked him if there is alcohol in it, he said yes and he was so kind when we said we would like to exchange it for another flavour. Alvin kept apologizing to us which made us feel he is very sincere. He is also very observant and provided fast service. Food wise......... i ordered the cordon bleu which was suppose to come with sweet potato fries but it came without and i asked the female waitress who doesnt seem to know their menu well. The fries then came later separately. The bread was the nicest of all. All in all, will not come back here - but kudos to Alvin, he made our evening better. For the price paid, the food and service was not worth it. I can understand why this place which was packed, is not empty even during peak hours on a Thursday evening - dont understand why customers cant sit at the sofa when the place is not even half full. For $100 for two pax (took the set + one tea), go somewhere else

Had my own misgivings of the food but overall the meal was average. I ordered eggs benedict for a main while my friend had squid ink pasta. The poached eggs were slightly overdone and would have preferred a thicker base like brioche (instead of a biscuit). Found texture of squid ink pasta to lack chewiness. Crepes seemed a bit too underdone. And honey lavender tea was overpriced for the offering.
1
I came this morning and there were only two tables occupied (a group of 5 who were already eating and one table at the back of which I could not see the no of occupants) at about 11am. The kitchen staff (open kitchen concept) had to ring the bell 3x just to get the serving girl to come around and led me to a table. She was quite nice. When I was ready to order I pressed the service call buttond three times and no one came. I walked over around the corner and saw that girl was busy at the drinks station. I did not even bother to get her attention and I just collected my stuff and I left. I knew if I persisted I would just end up infuriated.The restaurant was obviously very understaffed and given the layout of the restaurants with so many nooks and crannies, more staffs should have been provided. People always raves about this place and today's experience was very unfortunate. I might try again on another day
3
Great place, comforting and cozy place. I ordered the high - tea package for two with iced lychee tea and lemongrass mint tea. Its served in a bird cage look alike, very unique. The food which is included in the package was good, my favorite is the smoked salmon with fried shallots, cream cheese mouse and micro salad and matcha cheesecake. Both they have a very beautiful flavor blending in your mouth. Lychee iced tea was the best part, great to refresh yourself in a hot weather and its slightly sweet, enjoyable and healthy. The service, well, not good, need more smile
4
Both offer value for $ , should change the tea menu for more selection. Staff should be moving around more to see to the needs of the customers. noticed they hang around the preparation counter too often .
2
location is good. interior is nice, cosy ambience. loved the tea but the service was unfortunately lackluster.
4
It was crowded for a weekday lunch but we got a nice sofa seat. Air con was not super strong so abit hot and stuffy. But food was good.
5
I love this tea house. From the ambience to the food and service, all i can say is kudos! I'm a very satisfied customer and will not hesitate to come back when I'm back in Singapore.
4
A casual meetup with my uni friends cum birthday celebration. Great food and services. We had an amazing time there:)
1
One of the worst dining experience ever. Service was slow. Staff was talking across to each other. Even overheard vulgarities used. It may have been better last time but not anymore.
1
Visited Arteastiq on a Sunday afternoon.Had a honey lavender tea with a duck wrap. Food was mediocre. The tea was lovely, but the disappointing part is that customers are not allowed to refill hot water for the tea. The pot of tea cost S$15 and i was expecting to be able to refill it & enjoy the tea for a second round. But no, no explanation given, you are just unable to do it. They don't serve water too. Overall service level was pathetic. I am sure there are many other tea salons that serves nice tea with better service
4
I was having a classy lavender tea session which was nice, beautiful scent, a nice cookies. The lavender smelt good but it didn't taste too strong in the tea which I thought it is perfectly fine. I ate the ribs for the main course with foie gras and matcha cheesecake with tounge popping candies which is also rich in texture. For $5x is a nice experience.Btw, there is a painting session held on some schedules. Please do check the schedule if you are keen to paint
3
Our party of 3 was seated in the area with large windows which was great as it had comfortable seating and let in a lot of light. Down side was that there were no blinds or light curtains to provide shade, thus 2 of my friends had the sun in their eyes from 3 to 530pm! The saviouries and sweets for their tea tray was average in taste and presentation. They have some nice tea selection. We red red a side of duck wrapped in crepe, that dish was delicious
3
The restaurant has a lovely ambience, especially if you sit next to the windows with the trees. Duck confit in the lunch set is good too. And the teas. But the burrata, bacon and salmon dish was awful. The portions are small for the price. But I will still go for the duck and the tea
4
Food is very good with creative touches and set lunch is value for money. However, Setvice can be improved upon.
3
the service was a little slow and there waitress served wrong order 2x. food was unremarkable. drinks were ok. ambience was nice though
5
The staffs are friendly and attentive. They served their customers with a smile too. Food was nice and definitely will come again.
2
staff is not polit when i ask for window seats even when there are so many empty window seats ,she say in your reservation we never guarantee you window seats.
3
Firstly they missed out our tea, then they forgot about our desserts.
Tea was fine, but food was just average, I won't even say that it's delicious.
Desserts were not bad.
5
Don't even bother to send in a comment or request because they don't read it. It was a nice place for friends gathering & high tea! They serve really nice food and tea.
1
My first trip to this overrated restuarant. Spoiled by a 45 minutes wait for a pasta? Bill came less than a minute and cafe was barely half filled. For the place this restaurant is located and the prices that they charge for the dining, they need to do way better. Thumbs down. Definitely will not patronize them again
4
Arteastiq is a favourite place whenever I am in Singapore. With its charming decor, lovely range of tempting teas and drinks, and great food. It's a well-known place for afternoon tea served in a birdcage tray. There's a place for those who wish to do painting without messing one's home and popular on weekends. The menu has some very creative and teasing names like Geisha Whispers, cold soba noodles with salmon and light dressing which I enjoyed very much with a Martini glass of Japanese Ume wine. A novel teahouse with attentive service
2
We walked in at around 7pm and waited to he seated. As we were being brought to our table, we walked past some servers/kitchen staff and they were very friendly, greeting us and smiling and all that. I was quite impressed and was hoping that that was a sign of a good dinner ahead. I was wrong. The table we were assigned was partially set. The four top table was only set with two napkins and a fork, but as w had not ordered yet I figured that I would let it slide (although in hindsight, they didn't set the table back up the entire evening). Pressed this button thing and a waiter popped up and he proceeded to take our orders. The wife ordered the ala carte three course meal (bread platter, chicken cordon bleu, deconstructed matcha somethingorrather) while I opted for the mothers day set dinner (potato soup, steak, some deconstructed tiramisu kind of thing) and a pot of iced lychee tea. The starters came to the table promptly. The bread platter did not disappoint and the soup (if just a little on the cold side) tasty. What irked me was that really had to ask the servers for a knife to ladle the butter and jam etc. Note that the table was not at and that we had no cutlery. As we were nearing the end of our starters, my steak appeared. Although we had not requested our mains, I figured maybe that was how they worked it at this establishment (although I don't recall seeing a restaurant predominantly serving set meals firing courses without the guests to ahead) and accepted the dish. The presentation was nice and the steak tasted good. Expecting my wife's orders to arrive any minute, I took a bite out of my steak (after requesting for some more cutlery). Two mouths in and I realise no chicken is coming. I asked the server as to where the chicken could have disappeared to, and after some confusion, the waitress apologises and informs us that they sent it to the wrong table (at that time there were 4 tables/9 pax) and that they will prepare the dish immediately. The chicken, like the steak, was very tasty (when it finally arrived... Without cutlury). The server (in her defence) was extremely apologetic and I was, again, starting to forgive and forget and enjoy the good food. The desserts were served after we had completed our meal... But they missed out one of our dessert orders. Again. Twice in one seating is a first for me though. It is very sad to see a restaurant with good food and drinks have these levels of service.

Been here on a Sunday brunch with 5 other friends of mine. We got here and waited for the food for one hour! The food came out too cold for us to eat so we did not enjoy the food as it was supposed to be served.We peeked its open kitchen because the wait time was too long - they were basically understaffed.The food obviously turned out to be mediocre, like it was something that you're not going to come back for.French toast was barely eatable, cordon blue was just alright, eggs Benedict was perhaps the most eatable food
3
First visit to this tea boutique and the experience wasn't good . Food took very Long to Come ... Services were quite slow as well .
3
You get what you pay for. The tea selection was good, the food was not bad and the service could have been better.
1
Love the tea and the place but the service was not that good. We waited so long to be seated and the server is not that attentive. The food is normal and was not expected to be such.
3
Food was great, ambiance was great. Service wasn't, they made us wait for almost 40 mins for two dishes despite of low crowds. If we didn't tell them about our food, they have probably made us wait for an hour.. Very disappointed. Hope it will be better next time
3
I personally love High tea! And I must say Arteastiq serve good and refreshing Tea.Ordered the High Tea set this time. At $48++ for 2pax relatively decent price. Food taste not bad as well. It's actually a nice high tea place overall.However, the services wasn't up to expectations!The wait was long even if you have gotten ur seat(s). We have to try very hard to get the service staff to attend to us. And all the technology buttons available for services was faulty or useless!!Anyway they don't take reservations for high tea.So this make us uncertaint if we are going to wait very long for the tables
3
This was my third time to patronize Arteastiq because I really like their steak, with the company of salad and sweet potato fries. I've tried sweet potato fries from many other dining places, but Arteastiq's was the best. I was truly disappointed when they changed the menu to replace it with sweet potato chips. Initially I thought chips refers to fries (fish & chips), but I was wrong. I hope the old menu will reinstate soon!
2
Went for dinner to surprise my bestfriend, food was not good. There are food items that were out of stock. Service was so bad... the waitresses were drinking and eating infront of the guest.. no respect and very rude. Worst of all, the bartender was saying so much vulgar infront of the guests. They don't serve ice water which was a minus point. One bottle of water costs $5. Risotto was 1/10. Ordered creme brûlée for desert and it was weird. It has bits of ginger inside? and it was extremely watery at the bottom. They did not even heat the sugar on the top properly... Was the worst.... i will never come back
4
Went to the this tea house , today before going to GV cinema.First impression- it was creative design, influenced by French.Menu - got two categories - one for ladies, and one for gentlemen.Order soup of the day, and salad, and organic tea.Organic tea was served in large glass pot and glass cup and two pair of oatwheat biscuit on the large tray. Then came large plate of salad - called Geisha Whisper.This salad came with green veggies, veggies cracker, and green soba noodles, and slices of salmon. (Very healthy meal.)Waiter would provide you with mobile device which allow you to press the button when you want them to attend to you.Total price for all these are $40-50, inclusive of GST and service charge
2
though food was nice and ambience was nice, the service was very slow. our lunch took 30min to arrive after order. They could have served the tea first but they didn't. we had to chase them multiple times. Also, is the bell on the table really working?
3
Tried two of their chef recommended dessert which cost $13 each before GST / service charge. Tried one of the ice tea and hot tea. Total cost :$80 (inclusive or GST & service charge) Good ambience however poor service, most of their servers are youngsters. Press their electronic controller for multiple times but no server appear. Have to catch them by calling them instead. One of the teapot was chip and was not changed. The only good thing about the place is that is decorated lavishly like a place for those tai tai.
4
Nice to enjoy tea in a relax and creative place.
All is served in style while seating comfortably in tick sofa.
Too bad there is no wi-fi...
2
Average food, ok service, old furniture, table too low for meal. Not a place that I will go to in the near future.
5
brought my mother in law for her 70th birthday lunch treat and she loved it! great weekday lunch set!
4
Quality of food is there but the portion a little too small for me. Atmosphere was good. Drinks was good too.
4
Had a great time with the missus at their plaza singapura branch. Nice interiors with a class ambience. Service was a little let down with not so much service crew walking around to check on patrons despite being dinner time. Food was excellent and artisan tea delicious. Entertainer app provides 1for1 main course making it all the more worthwhile
2
We made a Chope reservation for 4 but was told they didn't have a record of our reservation. Thus, they gave us an extreme corner seating. Perhaps they were understaffed that day, we had a hard time getting the attention of the service crew to take our orders. So finally I went to the order counter to place our order. Then, the food took ages to arrive. Overall, I would say the food was decent except for the soba salad which we felt could have been better. We liked the fusion teas though. Not sure if I'll Chope reservations in future as it doesn't seem reliable
2
We dined as a couple last Sunday (Jan 24) around 1pm. No reservations but we still got a nice table for 2. Btw, table was shaky and too squeezy (to be honest). Selection of food is just nice for a boutique tea house. The ambience was great but... Two major let downs. Taste of food and service. I dont give a damn if you gave me a bad neglected table as long as I have good service and nice food (worth every penny). We started off with a mushroom soup (2/5), bitter and old creamy soup. We decided to share a pot of Japanese Tea, but the requested 2nd tea cup came after a solid 15mins- we ended up sharing a cup which was unique. Mains were crab meat egg bens and salmon wellington. Pricey and sorry... Taste-wise: not really tasty at all. Service: 2/5. Why? There were 4 people handling the whole tea house, and well yeah, they just really don't know which is which and they are not attentive on what their guests' needed. We were there for an hr and our table was parallel to a table of 6. When we came they already finished their food but NOBODY clean/buzz their table until we left (that's a good one hour neglect). I am not a difficult customer but unfortunately, I am an observant. I hope they can improve soon.
3
Overall was ok. Food was nice, but maybe too hungry, the bleu cheese chicken looked too small in portion.It would be better if the cooking smell can be "parked away". Most of the patrons would sit, chat & chill, but definitely would not prefer to smell of 'oil' when leaving the place
2
Nice ambience. The food was impressive, very good presentation. Unfortunately, the service was so bad and poor. They had so many staff around the restaurant but none of them are attentive ❗️we waited for an additional cup for tea for 20 mins . The waiting time for food was so long 
5
All was good but there was just one lady staff which dont seem to be smiley. Food serving was fast, food deco prefect everything and was delicious. Nonetheless everything were just awesome. We will be back soon! Thank you chope for the swift booking. Happy new year
1
Absolutely awful. Some lowlights include: inexperienced and unknowledgeable staff; overpriced poor food; no wine by the glass; no free water. Don't go here. It's bad.
5
Nice special coffee and tea selections.
Food is also good.
Nice cosy environments for Chit Chats.
Nice greenery view of you sit by the window.
Very relaxing.
Food is modern yet rustic with small bites accompanying the main ingredient
3
the place is sophisticated but cozy. price is very reasonable. the tea is great & the wraps are awesome!
3
Nice food but staff could have been more attentive and friendly. Staff's knowledge of food is minimum when asked prior to ordering.
4
Tucked away at the fourth level of Mandarin Gallery ... It's quite a site riding up the escalator . I like watching people pint and have tea all in the same place . Really a nice place to just chillax
3
Went with sis on a Fri afternoon, food was good and enjoyable... however service were slow and we had difficulties getting attention of staff just to order a bottle of water after knowing no water being served. Knowledge of staff could do better, ordered an item and wanted to confirm that there's no beef. Was initially told there is but later got informed again mentioning that there's only pork. Tea and coffee was good though. Do try to pay more attention to customers while they try to catch your attention.
4
We came here for afternoon tea during weekend. The restaurant setting is nice and cozy. The Hi-tea set also pretty and appetizing! This place is really good for couples or small group of friends to spend the lazy afternoon. The whole restaurant in Plaza Singapura has only 3 serving staffs and service was not attentive and prompt. The restaurant should improve the service to make it better. Overall, good experience and recommend to try out this place.
4
I visited the place after reading nice reviews and recommendations from friends. I ordered their famous lychee tea which was okay. Ginger tea with whiskey was better though. For desserts pear tea ice cream in adam's was superb. Etna's peak was so so. We also ordered boston seafood soup with sweet potatoes which was good. I find the service too slow, food took more than 30 minutes to serve and we had to follow up every time. Other than that this is a great place to chill.
4
A nice place to unwind and relax in the hustle n bustle of Orchard belt. Was there for lunch on a weekday and they do offered a very good for value lunch menu at only $15++ inclusive of their specialty tea. Food was good and the tea was fragrantly brew.. We ordered their signature lychee tea and pomelo tea. It was good. Service wise can be improved though. Only downside, seats by the windows side were a bit too close for intimate conversation. You could easily hear what the next table is talking about
3
We were at Arteastiq for High Tea and were impressed by the range of tea. Quality wise, decent. Service was acceptable, can be better though. We had to ask for plates, which is strange. That should have been given automatically.If you try this place, ask to be seated by the window. We got an excellent view of Orchard rd :
3
The high tea set and tea is not as good as before. Nice place to spend quiet afternoon with friends. But do not have high expectation on food and drinks.
5
It was a simple lunch with the family, everyone ordered their seperate meals. Both the tea and coffee are good. High tea is recommended for those who like Seafood.
4
I went to Arteastiq Boutique Tea House at Mandarin Gallery with my dearies, spent our night there. The food we ordered was pretty good and yummy. We like their lychee iced tea the most and ordered it whenever our visits.The ambience is very relax and comfortable. However, the dim light indoor is way too dark, we are hardly to see/read their menu. Ended up with the help of our handphone light/torchlight. :DOverall is satisfying! ((
4
Was too stuffed to eat mains but my companions loved it. Portions were decent. Loved the dessert -- portions were tiny but really yummy (esp the chocolate ice-cream and the maoshanwang durian ice cream). I would srsly return for the chocolate ice -cream! Staff were very obliging and helpful. Ambience was pleasant and calming
5
Spent a great afternoon having tea, coupled with the one for one promotion from an app. We took one for one main from the all day breakfast. Eggs were done very well and the ribs from the gentleman's menu were equally good. Also tried the afternoon tea set for two, not much variety and just common stuff for Sgd 48.00, comes with 2 pots tea (iced or hot) of your choice. The girls loved the ambience and the crowd were mixed. Will go there with my girlfriends for afternoon tea and laze the afternoon away soon
5
I love the food, ambience and overall concept of the restaurant. It is a lovely place to unwind and catch up with friends. My favourite dishes are the Nordic lights- Soba Salad, La Quesadilla and The Royal Princess-Salmon Wellington. The portions are very generous too. The desserts are splendid too. I like the Airy Fairy and Silk Thread. Arteastiq also has an amazing selection of tea. The Pear tea is very refreshing and light and aids in digestion. Will definitely be back
5
Arteastiq really impresses me with their range of interesting fruit teas such as lychee, pomelo, lemongrass, mint and a lot more selections. Love the exquisite glass display for tea. Somehow the tea simply tastes heavenly and very differently from any other tea. Food is also I should say artistically impressive and delicious, now with their ala carte menu with more selections. I like that there is a generous serving of vegetable salad. A good meal or tea place and an excellent meeting place to gather with friends. I will usually host my overseas friends for a meal at Arteastiq whenever they visit Singapore. The ambience is relaxing, modern and classy yet price is affordable
4
Enjoyed the food and teas. Especially pear tea. Weekday Lunch set was worth the money. Service personnel could not speak proper English and one lady especially probably woke up on the other side of the bed . No smiles. Curt replies. Placed tea pot and accessories precariously in between two tables without warning . 
3
Its a delightful oasis in the hurly-burly of Orchard Road with a nice concept- refreshing fruit teas and and generally light eats. Its the implementation that falls short. The pomelo tea was nice but far too much ice. I had the mushroom soup as a starter and the Crab Cakes Benedict as a mains. The mushroom soup was good but not certainly "the best in the world" as claimed. The Crab Cakes Benedict which is crab cakes added to an Eggs Benedict was served at the same time as the Mushroom soup. By the time I got to the mains it was cold which compounded the bland flavour. I did not dare try the desserts which looked interesting. Service was good if a bit soulles
4
Sent an email 3 weeks before going down to the place but to no avail. However, overall experience is great! My boyfriend enjoyed his birthday time spent painting and a complimentary tea was given. Would recommend to those who love unique experiences such as social painting. (
3
A nice place to hang out especially for ladies. Service was superb but there's a lack of staff . Food is expensive and taste not good
2
Food is at average level but service is very bad. Intends to celebrate birthday there but have to see the black face of one of the waitresses. She is very rude to my friend.

My review is based on the 2nd branch which just recently opened in Plaza Singapura. I haven't bothered to review many restaurants in the past year as I forgot my tripadvisor password. But the excellent experience here has led me to retrieve said lost password. I made a reservation for 3 to celebrate my aunt's birthday here. The ambience is nice, girls will probably like it alot, but i did see quite a number of male diners too. It was a full house despite it being a weekday evening.We ordered the wellington salmon for 2 and the ribeye for our main courses. When the wellington was served, I felt a tad apprenhensive at the portions (supposedly for 2 yet didn't look that big to me). But seriously, that was the last of any form of apprenhensiveness for the evening. The salmon turned out to be delicious and extremely filling (perhaps because of the puff pastry?). My ribeye was excellently cooked and melt in your mouth divine. I paid similar price for a ribeye at Canopy a few weeks back - and Canopy was dreadful. But I shall save that for another review if I can be bothered. Haha.Please let me carry on describing my meal. The veggies (asparagus and sweet potato cubes) that came with the salmon was equally scrumptious and went very well with the salmon. The accompanying egg, onions, carrots and assorted veggies with my ribeye was so so so yummy. Don't forget the crispy sweet potato fries! There wasn't a morsel that I didn't like. And I'm not a veggie person. But I don't know how on earth the chef did his magic and got me to eat the onions cos' I never ever touch onions... They were caramelized and sweet and so delish! I had a clean plate at the end of my meal. That steak sauce is to die for!So the conversation (after the mains came and were shared btw the 3 of us) generally revolved around "the food is good" "i am so full" "this is so delicious". Haha. So naturally when the staff came to clear our plates, we remarked to her that the food is very good and asked her to pass our compliments to the chef. She did so, and the chef waved to us from the kitchen to acknowledge. We waved back.Little did we know that the chef would come out later to serve us a plate of dessert on the house (choc cake w berries). Wow! He also personally wished ny aunt happy birthday after we told him that its her birthday. Such a nice gesture even though all we did was tell him the truth, that we enjoyed the food very much. The service staff also wished my aunt happy birthday later.We also ordered a dessert each after our mains. Had the mao shan wang with ginger tea, lychee pear sorbet w pear tart, and a tea (can't rem which, I am too full). The desserts totally match up to the standard of the mains. Wow. I am so impressed. The mao shan wang durian ice cream is SO GOOD OMG (I totally regretted ordering the lychee and pear sorbet separately... Not to discount the lychee sorbet cos' it is very nice in its own right, but me the durian lover could easily eat 3 scoop of that durian ice cream!!!). The pear tart is a sweet treat, and my aunt enjoyed her tea very much. We were stuffed at the end of the meal. I was already stuffed after the mains, I have no idea what possessed me to order dessert, but I don't regret it! Total bill came up to $80++ for the 3 of us (I used Entertainer app to get 1-for-1 for the main course). It was worth every penny. Such a surprisingly delightful experience! Thank you Arteastiq PS staff for our lovely evening
4
My overall verdict Food Quality & Presentation: 8/10. What more can I say for with fanciful displays for a ladies chat up session? :) Service: 8/10 - noticed there were 3 drinks? We didn't bother at first as we were busy chatting! We actually didn't even touch the drink but the service staff came over like a min later to apologise for sending the wrong drink over and told us that it was on the house. Other than that, their service was prompt, attitude was good too. Ambience: 7/10. I would have given 8 or 9 if the furniture was newer
2
I can only agree with a past review that service is inefficient and slow. Only thing I enjoyed was a jug of mint lemongrass tea. Don't know about painters/sketchers who have a free canvass to paint/draw on. The entrance is to me, hidden and deceiving. Please improve
3
Presentation of food was fantastic. Food quality 2nd taste was not too bad either. Howveer the drawback was the attentiveness of the staff. There were at least 4 staff working and the place was not packed. But we often have difficulties getting their attention. We realised that they were gathered at a hidden corner chatting away
3
I find that the concept was very unique and original. It was my first time coming to this place, and would definitely go back to try more stuff to eat/drink and things to do.My first experience was not bad, but not excellent also, except for the cozy ambiance that the place exudes which is for me the highlight of the previous visit.The service was good. The staff are nice, but they could smile more often to give that friendly vibe.The food was nice. We were not able to try the teas or desserts as they are closing soon. But I think, however plenty the options are, it seems all the same to me. I got a hard time choosing which one is worth choosing. So I opt for the Seafood stew, Boston Love Boat Ciponio. The flavors was good. Presentation also. But I hope they've put more contents inside the claypot. The pot is just too crowded with shells of the mussels and scallops, but not much of the meat which leads me to my next part of review.The value for money, I think is a bit short of my expectation. I mean, there are lots of good restaurants and cafe's around. While the pricing is okay, they could've added value to the dish by giving a larger portion. Or, they could've reduced the price a bit.
3
Overall, the food quality was average, but on the pricey side. We ordered the "Double Teasery" - food portions were really small. Drinks were definitely interesting with the wide selection of teas available, but also pricey (around SGD12 per drink), unless you intend to sit there for the afternoon. Atmosphere was definitely nice, with sunlight streaming in the large windows, good for chatting with girlfriends - if I went back, probably would just order drinks and not food
4
I happened to drop in while browsing around for a place to eat. It was really interesting with an open kitchen. The foei gras on the menu pique my interest. Rarely do i see a tea place offering foei gras and it was really so good with a generous portion to boot. Will definitely be back when i am in town. The environment was very cosy and well designed as well
4
I ordered the Aphrodite - Crabcake Benedict (S$25) and lurve the crabmeat. My friend's Louisiana Love - Chicken and Waffles (S$22) sounds like a strange combi but it worked, and I did like the Thai mayo dressing.I love the tea selection too. Loads and loads of tea options for a lady, woohoo!I felt classy sipping tea in beautiful environs :> But then I was seated on a platform and felt like I was in a precarious situation as I was afraid my chair would tip over the edge; honestly I do not think that was likely to happen, but it's a psychological thing and I felt hemmed in. I also found my section too dark for my liking. The section near the glass panes looks too hot for lunch and tea though - the afternoon sun was blazing - but coud be perfect for dinner.As it was full house on a Saturday afternoon, they took down my number and called me when seats became available. I got to go shopping instead of sulking in queue. They also accept The Entertainer app offers.Next time, I shall try the Afternoon Treats Special or the lunchtime specials

I went there with a happy mood but i was greeted with a very bad service, waited for the food for more than 1 hr at a non peak hour. I will never visit again.
3
Quite disappointed as the food is juat so so only and is not worth the price. Dun think will go back again.
5
Great food and decor. Awesome for afternoon teas and hanging out with friends. Will head back again.
4
Love their Pomelo Iced Tea! However, felt that their 2-tier was too little, not worth the price. Sofa needs a little cleaning too.
4
Ambience, service and food was great however the window seat was very warm due tot he sun shining in. Would have been better with blinds or day curtains.
5
The food that was served taste delicious and portion is just nice.
Even though that was lack of staff servicing the customer but the attitude and service is excellent.
Definitely a great place for couple and gathering to have a nice chat.
2
The portion was so sad for 2 people. And it cost $48++? And its promo price?!! You must be kidding me. Its basically things I can buy from cold storage and roll it up myself-ham, smoked salmon, prawn. Please never bother to go there.

We were a part of 2 dining at Arteastiq for dinner. We ordered their mushroom soup (they said "best in singapore"), sweet potato fries with aioli, Salmon Wellington (salmon wrapped in pastry) with "asparagus salad" and sauteed sweet potato - this dish was meant for 2. We also ordered their roasted hazelnut coffee blancelato (coffee blended with hazelnut gelato).The mushroom soup was creamy and had lots of mushrooms, certainly among the best I've had in Singapore (but may not be the best). The sweet potato fries were good, fried just like french fries, tasted great (they could give us more aioli dip for the fries - we ran out by the time the fries were consumed halfway). The Salmon was a little fishy (as expected), enclosed in lots of pepper but we had issues with their label - it is wrong to label the asparagus as salad (it was just a few strings of cooked asparagus, you can't call that a salad). And since this dish was labelled for 2 persons, the portions of asparagus and sauteed sweet potato were insufficient for two persons. The roasted hazelnut coffee blancelato was excellent - it was rich and flavourful, my favourite drink.All in all, the dishes were decent, although pricey. We were there at 7pm, but over half of the patrons ordered their high tea, which we may try on our next visit

Went to try out the afternoon tea just a few days ago. Quality is pretty high, eclairs, duck wraps and the cakes are tasty. However the portion is really small for 2 paxs. I had to order a few additional sides to make my meal complete. They should consider adding a few more savoury or desserts on the afternoon tea set. One of the side that I ordered was the Osmanthus creme brûlée. That was really good! I can finish that whole plate all by myself!We tried out the Osmanthus Oolong tea and rose nip tea. It was nicely brewed and tasted great! Would love to come back again to try out the other teas!Service level can be better. The waitress who attended to us was nice and friendly, however the cafe was pretty full at that point of time, hence I couldn't get her attention and need to reach out for other staffs to place our order ,which took forever! It's funny how teas are served when my desserts/savoury are almost finished. One of the staff told me they are still in the midst of preparing. Serving tea right at the start should be the way to go for afternoon tea! No apology for the long wait, and did not anticipate our needs. A couple of times my friend and i had to walk up to them to get our requests as they fail to notice our presence, I guess.Seems like Arteastiq got some work to do on their service level. I do hope they are looking at these reviews and start working on it
3
The customer service can be better.For the art jamming part is good. service was good and with a smile at all times. but for the cafe part it was quite bad. no greeting even i have already make a reservations and not friendly talking among themselves. i would go only if i want to paint again if not .. no for the cafe service...
3
we went for lunch. They have some unique plates on their menu. We tested foie gras, chicken (spicy) and some salad (baby spinach). The food is not bad, but the service is really mediocre. We will not come back thanks to this staff
1
No service and I reserve for a week before but we not being treat as a value customer and evening my wife she is very no expectation at all and she also found the food / tea is nothing special. We will NOT recommended.
4
Had their fusion tea beverages and a few snacks. Overall food was nice, and enjoy slowly will have a nice after taste maybe because they use sweet potatoes and the main ingredient.
I tried the cold lychee tea and was refreshing and nice.
3
We had dinner here.The lychee tea was wonderfully refreshing with a pleasant flavour - and I really liked how it was served in the glass teapot with glass tea cup.The two meals we had were quite tasty and a good size. Having a varied range of breakfast dishes available all day is a winning idea.The service was patchy - not to be sexist - but the women staff members were far more competent than the men - our first server seemed very vague and disoriented and didn't pick up on any of our non verbal signals to indicate that he had only delivered half of our drinks and meals.Quirky decor. Be careful if you are sitting up on the platform - the chair legs at the back can get perilously close to the edge!It was interesting to peer through the window to see what people were painting - although I'm not sure that I would like to be on the other side of the glass - too public

My friends and I had a birthday gathering at your Mandarin Gallery outlet.There were many things that went wrong in one visit:- our reservation was missed, but as two of us arrived early, we queued for our seats.- the person who answered our call was unable to answer any queries of the menu; we wanted to check if there were any vegetarian options and the staff said there was none. But there are some vegetarian options on the menu! - the drinks (2 out of 8 drinks ordered) which had whisky in them were served with half split whisky.- another staff was unable to tell us what he was serving us, especially when all 8 of us ordered different drinks, not being able to tell us what tea he was holding was just unacceptable.- we asked for one more chair when a friend decided to join us and supervisor Ling rudely told us after making one cursory glance that there were no more chairs. Another staff, a younger eurasian took the effort to get a stool from the other room for us. Ling did not even apologise.- the worst part of our experience was when Ling came to our table with another customer's birthday cake, still in box and plastic bag no less, candle unlit in hand, and spoilt the entire birthday surprise for us. Anyone with common sense would know that a birthday cake is for a celebration.While my frends and I enjoyed the atmosphere and appreciate the hard work your chefs have put in the food and drinks, it should not be destroyed by your front of house supervisor. Even the rest of your staff were a lot more service oriented than Ling. Bottom line: not worth to visit

chose this place after reading all the nice reviews. wanted to bring my wife for a leisurely afternoon tea after her month long maternity, but had to apologise to her for such a lousy experience:1. Waited 7 min at the entrance for a human being to at last notice our presence, despite our constant nods and acknowledgement. I think we have to uncivilised and wave our hands here to get attention. 2. The so-called Afternoon Tea Treat for 2 persons is a disgrace and not worthy to be served. The portion is very pathetic amounting to not more than 5 tiny items per person. We are not very big eaters and thus prefer exquisite café as compared to buffet style afternoon tea at hotels. But this is def something out of our tiny expectations. When we try to order small bites from the appetizer section, we were told we have to order from the main course instead as they do not prepare small bites in the afternoon. To me, the only difference is the portion of the menu items, nothing else. Is it to maximise revenue? Maybe. But not to the expense of making your valued customers felt they have to pay more to eat here. 3. You will be called a Superman or Wonderwoman if you are able to get attention from a service personnel. They seems lost and move around with their head looking down on the ground.4. The table we are seated at were not set up for a meal when we arrived. Obviously, it has just been vacated. Basic service excellence: clean up before you sit a guest. There were crumb everywhere. Are we at a hawker centre, I asked my wife......Spend a little bit more and go to Antonette down the lane or Jones the Grocer next door. Though they are not as ártistic'in décor as Arteastiq, I am certain they provide a much better experience for that well-deserved afternoon tea.. You will tell me the extra money paid is worth every smile on your face after which. Enjoy!

I went to Arteastiq to paint and I found the experience delightful. We were given the option to upsize our canvases from the usual square canvas, which was a nice surprise. The atmosphere was nice with the lighting and the jazz music but i found the layout a little tight. I understand that they do this to accommodate more people but a crowded room can be a bit of a hindrance to those who like painting in peace. I found the quality of the brushes poor but for the price we paid, I can say that was expected.
3
Perhaps they are resting on their laurels, or a blip in quality and service, as the food and service was just average. The saving grace was the cosy ambience, which could be because we were there early before the main crowd arrived (the place was fully booked for the day)
4
This is such a treat.. We knew arteastiq as only a place to hang out in orchard area. Convenient and cosy but the products was just so so… I remembered the first time I was there I was so confused with the menu naming and the concept of it all, taste of the food was horrendous, cold and unappetising. tea was ok albeit the price. Somehow after reading some review from ladyironchef.com I decided on try the food again… After all I was intrigued by the chefs they brought in. I know chef jason Vito from onaka for his imaginative cuisine and healthier lifestyle… I was pleasantly surprised the food is 200% better. The menu was easier to read and the concept of breakfast around the world really hit home.. There were some mishaps with the service and flow, but in the Singapore standard, its negligible.I really hope to see a better development from the team of chefs. Pretty sure I’ll comeback again one day

I made a reservation via Chope and requested for a corner table with sofa seats. When I got there, the waiter showed me to a table. I then asked if they have a corner table with sofa seats available and it turns out they do have it available but it wasn't offered to us. So we got seated and placed our orders. We patiently waited for 30mins and the food was still not served. The lady next to our table came later, finished and left. Hence we asked for our food. It turns out that our order didn't get to the kitchen but the manager offered us a 15% discount and promised that they'll prepare our food immediately. Ok, that's fine with us. We ordered quesadilla, chicken with waffle and mushroom soup. The quesadilla and chicken w/ waffle was delish. But the mushroom soup didn't come (shouldn't soup be served first?). I asked for it and the waiter said it's coming. Eventually it didn't make its way to our table but they billed it anyhow. And our discount wasn't reflected in the bill as well. We had to tell the waitress to remove the soup and put in the discount. All in all, the food was good and the atmosphere was good. However, for the two visits I was there, the staff were just not attentive and that made it a bad experience.
3
they had big portion of breakfast and taste not bad, the ambience was good and nice. we love the place and the food. service for breakfast just fine.
4
Very good breakfast, service needs more attention. With my breakfast they should also provide a slice of bread since it is not the cheapest place in town. Nice decor.
3
I enjoyed myself with the peaceful atmosphere and tea set. A good place to chill with buddies.......
2
I was here having some tea and desserts with my friend. We placed our orders and continue our usual girls talk. After 35 minutes, I asked the waitress "Are they ready to serve our tea"? she commented she forgotten to place our order. Hence, we waited for another 10 minutes though we are quite thirsty. while we were having dessert, the waitress was cleaning a table next to us and she broke a glass. We are lucky that none of us get hurt. We love their tea but we did not have a great time over there

Poor Hygiene - the table next to us left, with only one of the two diners used the cutleries. After they left, the staff replaced only the ones used, and left the one unused set on the table. That is just poor hygiene. He should have replaced the cutleries. Period.Ambivalent staff - another table asked for maple syrup, the staff plopped on their table an entire bottle of syrup instead of serving it in a small container. The diner then said they dont want corn syrup, which was served, the staff was not even aware what they used was NOT MAPLE SYRUP. But maple flavored corn syrup.There is NO REASON to go back there again. And certainly no recommending anyone

My sister took me here when I visited her in SG last Nov and I never regret it :). The place has nice ambience, lovely interior and of course delish tea and cakes. Service is excellent, price is worth the taste. I will definitely gobthere again when I visit SG in the future. Try it!

It was rather quiet as I think most of the logical crowds had been scared away with the sky-high prices. They don't serve water, and the cheapest drink you can have is $5 mineral water.With the prices of $10 for a snack and $20 for a main, I had expected better service, but I was mistaken. Both the servers they hired were deadpan and sullen. They delivered food without saying what was served.The food servings were tiny and not very well thought-out. I had ordered a wrap, but it was all cut up into big pieces, which fell apart as I tried to nibble at it. Taste-wise, it was ok.Won't return again

We first discovered this lovely, colorful haven because of the art gallery next to it - owned by it too in fact. Arteastiq offers a range of interesting tea that are often served in pretty teaware and delectable snacks.Tea came first. They always serve their teas along with pretty golden utensils and delectable little accompaniments. I had a Cinnamon Ginger tea that came with tiny squares of cakes. *Charliez had the Hibuscus Rose tea that came with red bean mochi pancake. Both the teas were served in dainty tea-ware, and very aromatic. It seemed befitting, to be enjoying hot teas in this elegant little tea lounge in lieu of cold drinksThe Cheese and Ham Tortillas had a character of its own - crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside. I love Tortillas, so this was a rather delightful selection for us. Like the dainty way the tea was being served, the Tortillas are cut into smaller triangles so it makes for easier consumption.

We popped in here for a quick lunch, which is probably not wise as you really need more time. However, the food was delicious and the service reasonable.My husband ordered the mushroom soup which was extremely tasty and I ordered a smoked salmon wrap type thing, which was delicious, if a bit small.The cappuccino was beautifully presented with two wafer thin biscuits as well as another small thin rolled biscuit, which was delicious
3
Pros- A quiet place to chat- not constraint by time- Nice and interesting opening entrance- Tea cutlery are beautifully chosen- Art Jam session was refreshing concept in Singapore- Location was easy to findCons- Paid S$60 for 2 pots of tea with 1 two-tier pastry, suggests to grab a bite before going.- Limited selection of pastries, suggest to go for hotel tea buffet for alternative selections- Cold service, crews are not equipped with proper recommendation to guests.- Food are not up to comparable to the atmosphere of the place.- Menu are old and dirty.- Reservation is not allowed. Information is not consistent with website.How to get there:Proceed to level 4 located in the main lobby of Mandarin Gallery.My recommendation is to spend your money and time elsewhere.In my opinion, its not worth a second visit.Check out my pictures

How to ruin a nice piece of cake? Re-heat it in the microwave until it becomes mush.Location 10Service 4Quality of Food & Bev 5So why did I come back...in the vain hope that previous review and others' reviews had perhaps improved things...and because I needed a place to sit and work...Why o why do Asian cafes insist on reheating pastries and cakes???

Landed at Arteastiq as my friend and me decided to go to somewhere we have not tried before. We saw the menu and the decor and thought it will be a good place to try.We were a little annoyed as we had to wait for almost 20 mins before we were served to get seated when there was no one before us. The waiters were all standing there and knowing there are customers waiting. They gave us one menu when there were 2 of us (did not understand this as there were so many menus on the table which they kept). There was delay in taking orders when there are not many customers in the restaurant. The food came pretty quick but it tasted horrible especially with the price we paid for. The desserts were good but i think that was it. The waitress which served us was honestly absurb in table manners. She wanted to clear a plate that belonged to my friend but she asked me?! When we told her that we wanted the soup to be left there, she took away the plate of which the bowl was on and left the bowl of soup there?! If the point of the plate is for aestique purpose without a function, do without it then. Worst of all, i think it was the manager (indian guy with shoulder length curly hair) who settled the bill with me was not happy and seemingly frustrated. I think is not too much to ask for good service with good food in a restaurant that is located in Mandarin Gallery which has mid range price tag or is it? Definitely not going back and will not recommend to ANYONE

I must admit that I heard countless comments from friends raving about their unique experience at Arteastique. Most of them went for the Art Jam (social painting and tea), coupled with some random experience at the dining section.For me, I was more keen on the Art Jam session. I made a reservation online (dropped them an email) and got no reply whatsoever for 3 days. After which, I decided to call in and make my reservation instead. I highlighted to the lady over the phone of my email reservation and she seemed unaware of it. I wonder, who is manning the email inbox? If no one is manning the reservation email, then why provide an email address for reservation?Anyway, food was pleasant. Service was expected and really nothing more; what could be said of young servers who know nothing of providing good service?After dining, we went next door for our slated Art Jam session. The "lady" at the counter was pleasant and comprehensive. However, I was sorely disappointed with the guide for the Art Jam session. I paid $88 for a Sat, 6pm-9pm session and our guide was spending 80% of her time concentrating 4 others who obviously had bought the package of 10 art sessions. Seriously, is this how you treat potential customers? Giving them only a preview of your time while making them pay FULL RATE? A good, indirect marketing ploy to get one to sign up for their 10 session package - sign up or get 10% of guide time only!Only because I love painting and art, that I am sticking with the session. In the end, we couldn't finish our painting within 3 hours and had to schedule to come back again at $10 per hour! My goodness! Why? All because our guide spent all her time ensuring the 'package buyers' could complete their art on time, under her studious tutelege (90% of her time). Personality-wise, the guide took a while to warm up but was quite nice.Speechless.Try it if you are really short of things to do on a weekend

Overall, this place is growing on me.During my first visit many months ago, I was left standing at the entrance with disinterested staff looking at me and then looking away !Food was decent, quantity was on the small side, and I was still hungry after the set dinner.I stayed away for many months.I returned recently. There seems to be more diners. Food is still good as before. The staff can be friendly, so it is somewhat a pity they fail to show this aspect !Food prices are decent value, portions still small, but good quality.There is a WIDE selection of tea and coffee, prices are higher because you get cookies, chocolates, lychees to accompany depending on your drink orders.I am tempted by the alcoholic coffee creations, so I will be back to try this and of course to savour the food again soon

i've make my 1st phone call once i bought the voucher from groupon. the waitress told me the restaurant is fully booked. then i changed my plan and called for the second times one week later. the waitress knew i've bought my voucher from groupon and she told me every weekend is fully reserved til the end of deal! her attitude was so bad! i get pissed and asked why there's deal if you don't want the customer to pay visit? what for we paid so much and can't even go and have our meal? the deal it's not cheap either! SGD 58 for 2 and what i received was this kind of attitude? then the waitress replied me with annoyed voice.. told me i can pay my visit during weekend. hello? weekday? means i have to apply leave just to visit your restaurant with this kind of bad services? the waitress end up told me i can try to walk-in. i've told the waitress don't tell me i can't walk-in with voucher when i reached! let's see this few weeks what response i have when i go there! hope the services will change better. hope won't disappoint me again! :

We ordered For 3 teas, 2 cold and one hot ginger spiced tea. The cold teas came in a jiffy , but the did not serve the hot tea for an hour (1 hour) in spite of reminding them 3 times. The final complaint was met with a superb response of how they are busy on a weekend. It is sad that such a lovely concept is not backed up by impeccable service . Or may be the owners spent too much on the product and hoped it would run on love and fresh air.

An impressive selection of teas and desserts! The perfectly brewed tea is served on a tray in a glass tea-pot and cup and saucer. The ginger tea is highly recommended. The orange cake is a house specialty and rightly so - moist and delicious!The unusual feature of this café is that you can paint while you enjoy your tea in an adjoining studio

Heard about this restaurant that had a very interesting menu and thought I would try it out for brunch today. A real let down, the service was very very bad, the staff were not interested in their customers, preferring instead to look pretty and spend all their time texting on their phones....the food took forever to come and when it did, the presentation was just horrible. I had the pancakes with scrambled eggs and salmon, the pancakes were half cooked and very doughy.....horrible, just horrible! A few people came in, sat down, did not get welcomed or served, so they got up and left!!! I paid the bill and left.....the staff could not care less if I came back or not, as they just ignored us! I give this place a year or less before they close their doors.........its a shame really as the menu is interesting. The restaurant's décor is interesting but not exactly functional...I for one will not be going back........a complete waste of a Sunday morning!!
2
felt the same... everyone tells me it's a must go place... but am utterly disappointed the servers doesn't seem to be able to plan and serve the items with profession and requires the customer to actually help remove cups/ plates from the table... plus the way they serve an empty cup is not at all hygienic. for the amt of money customers pay i believe the servers should have the minimal training. i believe their decor is to attract pple who are geniunely here for tea, and chat the afternn away. but becoz they're trying to increase sales, crowd control is bad... tables are too close and customers actually hear what the next table is yacking about... if it's meant to be an "atas" cafe, be an "atas" cafe and not a kopitiam

It's pretty. It's in a pretty nice place along Orchard Road. It has some interesting offerings on the menu. I ordered the Oolong with Cocospoon. Unfortunately I was not sure how to eat the Cocospoon. My friend said that I needed to melt the Cocospoon in the tea and I must say that it's way too interesting for me.I went there on a Sunday night so the place was quite empty. This also means that although I felt that service was pretty ok, it is not a good measure of the service that is usually rendered when the place is busier.My friend had the orange cake and apple cake (I think it's apple cake) and they liked them. I should say that this place is worth a visit if you are in Orchard and looking for a place to lounge in the middle of hustletown. Menu is a bit special so you might either be surprised (found something you like) or disappointed (nothing catches your fancy) but then again, that is so everywhere.Only gripe I have is that such a cafe started their cleaning routine at 2130, when they stated that they will close at 2200. I am there to relax, not be stressed by you cleaning up to close
