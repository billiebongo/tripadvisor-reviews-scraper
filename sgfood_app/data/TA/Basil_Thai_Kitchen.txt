I ordered red tom yum soup with rice and coconut water in shell, its delicious and the price also reasonable. The food served promptly, I will consider to eat in here again if I go to Singapore.

Friendly and fast service, cheap prices with decent sized portions of food and very tasty! But would love to have more vegetarian and vegan options, maybe a curry

We shared three different dishes and they were all very tasty, well prepared, beautifully presented and promptly served. Absolutely no complaints and we would be happy to eat here any time again.

Fairly good dinner we had here one night in November. We had red tom yum soup with prawns, crispy roti, fried fish and brown jasmine rice. It was a light meal for two, washed down with hot green tea and hot lemongrass tea. Tasty!Service wasn’t bad but wasn’t extraordinary as well. Place is not inviting to go back to during dinner time. I felt it was too full of people. But overall, it was acceptable. One good thing about BTK is value for money.

You can't really expect much for a restaurant in a shopping mall, but I think even basic standards should be met, and Basil Kitchen fails on several important fronts. Unlike most Thai restaurants that offer dishes to be shared between several people or "family-style", this place offers mostly rice dishes for individuals, so you get a bowl of rice along with every main dish. The problem is that the serving size of each main is so small that it's basically only a few spoonfuls. Their red and green chicken curries, for example, are served in a small 220 ml (7 oz) bowl, along with the rice on a plate. There was about 2oz of chicken in that small bowl, swimming in greasy gravy. The Thai omelette with shrimp was a more generous serving but only because there was so much flour added to puff it up and this too, was soaking in oil. There was so much oil that I had to send it back to the kitchen. They removed the plate and brought it back two minutes later and said, "That's how it is, it's fried so it's oily." When I protested they said they would get the kitchen to redo it. Five minutes later they brought one just as greasy, so I gave up. Despite the grease (or perhaps because of it), the food was tasty but very rich. Thai food is of course inherently highly flavoured, and all the more, requires a light touch with the oil. Service is pleasant, but due to Singapore's infamous labour shortage, the place is understaffed and waitstaff are harried and rushed
