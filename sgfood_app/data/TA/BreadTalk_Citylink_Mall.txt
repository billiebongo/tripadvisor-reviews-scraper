I tried the BreadTalk at Zongshan Mall, diagonally opp. to Hotel Ibis, Novena. For SGD 4 I had a delicious sweet bread and a savoury bread (cannot remember names). My other family had a Subway breakfast and I found this much lighter and good in the sense, you can pick up 2-3 different varieties of bread for the same price as a meal and equally filling. You have to pick your choice of baked good and get it to the counter and everything is fresh and delicious

I had been to a few BreadTalk places previously. They all sold tasty breads and pastries, with a lot of varieties to choose from. I did occasionally get their birthday cakes for family member's special occasion though. There is always 1 or 2 flavors that are not so sweet, and that is great. They also have branches in Shanghai. However, seems not many people in their shops. I happened to get 3 slices of black forest cake for my husband's birthday last week. In my view, the cake itself is not too sweet, which was great; however, the filling might be a bit too rich. And thus to eat once in a while is okay, but definitely not so on a frequent or regular basis

Modelled after Taiwanese bakeries, its rise to fame was the meat floss buns. It delighted many lovers of the Taiwanese's version of fluffy meat floss bun, and is quite delicious. It has now included cakes, and a wide range of pastries to cater to everybody. So much so, it has became an average run of the mill pastry shop. Worth visiting for its selection of bread and pastries to quench your hunger pangs and urge for sweet stuf, especially on your way back to your hotel!Note: Cash or credit cards accepted. Also serves drinks. Located very near to City Hall MRT, and just after the entrance to CityLink Mall

We had just eaten lunch at Tim Ho Wan and purchased mini-loaves at Duke Bakery and were walking back toward City Hall MRT station, when we spotted BreadTalk across the corridor. Walked over and spotted cheesecake in the display case. My partner loves cheesecake, so we purchased one slice, at S$6. It was tasty enough, but we actually preferred the Chinese Wolfberry mini-loaf from Duke's Bakery. I was tempted to sit down and enjoy a leisurely cup of coffee, but we had to be on our way..
