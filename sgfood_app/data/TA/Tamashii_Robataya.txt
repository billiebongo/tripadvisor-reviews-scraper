Always love to visit this place specially for the weekdays lunch set. The Grilled chicken and teriyaki fish are my favorite and the yuzu sorbet is one of the best I ever had.

Love the food and service was great. Ambience could have been better if not for a table next to us that were very drunk and rowdy. Try their Striploin beef, truffle chawanmushi and salt baked fish! Skip the sashimis!

Good lunch set and good atmosphere for Friend gathering. Service ok and they are nice and friendly staff

I always come here for the beef teriyaki and the goma ice cream. The set meal is fairly pricy but it does come with sashimi, soup, rice, mushrooms, salad and dessert. I'd personally prefer having less courses but cheaper.
4
Popped in here for another lunch recently with a friend. The lunch sets are really quite good value. We paid around $60 for 2 lunches which included tea and dessert. I suspect I'll be back again before too long.

Can't decide... let the friendly chef decide for you.
Must try the SAGA GYU DON.
Overall taste, food, sake & service is ichiban.

this private dining area serves up some pretty good japanese food. we loved the setup too, with the raw ingredients of the various foods laid out fresh in front of us. staff were very prompt and friendly too, an enjoyable experience

The other day we decided to treat our self to a nice Japanese meal. Unfortunalty it was a disappointment from the atmosphere, to the food quality and the amount we paid. More importantly is the food quality. No disrespect, but a high class Japanese restaurant with a Chinese chef with zero charisma was the first indication that we might have chosen the wrong place. The food was simply not up to standard.The atmosphere was compromised by three rather loud, what appeared to be the owners friend, using all kinds of vulgarities to express them self. The owner joining in at times, completely ignoring the fact that there other people dining is his place.At the end there was the bill. We do not mind to pay good dollars for good food but this was far from it. Too much dollars for too little of what we came for

Pricey and chefs had bad attitude. Authentic Robataya is supposed be over open fire but this is done over hotplate. Very good selection of seasonal ingredients from Japan but unfortunately ruined by lousy cooking and service. Chefs don‚Äôt seem to know their stuff and have bad attitude. Won‚Äôt ever want to visit this place anymore.

We order two beet steak lunch sets. The piece of steak I had was so rough that can hardly swallow but to spit out every time. That was very embarrassing during a business lunch. Usually the food standard of this restaurant was above average when I ordered other items.
4
We ordered the pork cheek gindara and squid. Thought the pork cheek was really good, the gindara was quite mediocre though
5
Good place for japanese food. Its my second time there. Each time i went with different grp of friends and they were satisfied too!
4
Nice food, nice place, nice atmosphere. My first time there, I most likelt will try it again one day.
4
Lunch set menus are very worth it and great for express lunch. The truffle beef bowl is great. Lady's lunch is light and perfect as well
3
If only a proper table seating was given to me on that day would be appreciated as I had invited my friends from overseas and it would be a great impression.
4
Satisfied meal especially good saga beef don and roasted fugu jerky.
Would be better if the price is cheaper costed $80 for one person.
5
Went twice once for lunch n once for dinner. Love it both times. Lunch set was substantial n reasonably priced. Dinner we went with a party of 6 thought we only ordered mostly appertizers as we had sake n chit chat we were so full we did not order any main course. All were tasty. Lovely embience. Will go back again

Patrick Tan, the boss, cooked whiskey wagyu beef sukiyaki. Very good taste. Friendly attentive service staff. Small seating capacity so the ambience is quiet and private. Restaurant on 2nd floor. Need elevator e.g some disability then use side entrance of building to get elevator otherwise walk up stairs that is controlled by glass door that auto-open when you are near door. Washroom needs to be opened by staff so inform them to unlock for you. May be deemed as quite expensive for some people. About S$180 each for 5 of us for the saki, sukiyaki as main and about 8 small dishes and mochi dessert. See photos of small dishes

I am thankful for friends. It is always friends who bring to hidden gems like this. I would never be able to find this place on my own. It is along the row of shophouses facing OCBC Center. It doesn't have a shopfront because it is upstairs. So the Restuarant cannot count on walk-ins. And we walked in. No reservations. It was full. We had to make do with bar seats. The set lunch is very good value. No wonder it is packed. I had the ladies set lunch at $32.00. It is a well balanced meal. An excellent salad with sashimi, a noodle and that truffle chawamushi just have me inspiration how to make my steamed eggs in future. Other set meals are below $30.00. Love this place. Will come back again ! The ambiance is nice too !

Came here for lunch today with a friend. Somehow I've never noticed this place before, perhaps because it's hidden away on the 2nd floor. But it's a decent restaurant with good quality Japanese food and the lunch sets are excellent value. I had the salmon set and was quite satisfied afterwards. Service was a little abrupt but otherwise no complaints at all
5
Cozy environment with good food.
Friendly staff and humble Chef.
Reasonable pricing but good quality food
5
Reaaaalllly love the grilled veggie. If you come here, you should definitely order the grilled veggie. Portion was quite tiny though
1
Chirashi was not fresh. Taste weird and we had an upset stomach after that. The price that we paid was not worth the quality we got.
4
Been to this place a few times and still love the food, the place, and the ambience.
Always order the gyudon. The combination of the beef, the onsen egg, and the truffle oil, just melt in your mouth.
4
Good for value set lunches, service was a little slow but friendly servers makes up for it. Was nice to have the private room since we have a big group but tables are limited so best to reserve ahead.
4
Very good food and service. Staff is friendly and the atmosphere feels very much like Japan. Would definitely go back.
4
Easy and simple when making reservation. Fast confirmation on the reservation. It will be good if we can book more than 4 pax via chope.
5
It's my first visit and I'm glad I decided to try. I love the very good quality of food and sake, super attentive staff and the nice atmosphere. Service can make or break a dining experience and I have to say the attentive service staff all did a great job. Will visit again.
5
Slightly hard to find, on the first floor with the stairs running up beside the beside Sultans of Shave, this is a fantastic restaurant with stunning food! It is not cheap, or perhaps it was just that we ordered the most expensive dishes, but the food is fantastic!Am really looking forward to a return match
5
Was invited there for a business lunch and whilst I have been to the Circular Road area numerous times over the years I don't recall ever going to a venue off the ground floor - as it's no really the "norm" here in Singapore, unlike Hong Kong for example.The venue decor and the service were fine but what really impressed was the quality of the meal.I am a fan of Japanese food and this is one of the better venues in Singapore in that price range
4
Nice and cozy ambience to catch up with friends. The set lunches are really worth it, good quality and variety.
4
Tamashii is the best Robayataki in CBD.
With their tastefully designed smokeless grilled counter and fresh produces displayed before you, you will be out to impress whoever you are dining with.
4
Food is good.....enjoyed the noodles made using fish. Had the warabi mochi for dessert - it was just right - melt in your mouth - and not too sweet.
4
Had lunch with my business associate here, great business set lunches. Love the ambience although it can get a little bit noisy. Remember to ask for corner seats or table.
5
This is my fav restaurant for Japanese food in RP. Firstly the menu is extensive. I've been able to select different set lunches and been thoroughly pleased. The beef kyo don is good value and tastes great. Love the added bonus of dessert too
4
Love the great set lunches which are really value for money. Ask for a seat at the counter where you can see the chefs at work.
4
Came here on a business lunch. Great and ambience and set lunches as per usual. Remember to ask for a corner seat at the counter!
5
Love the appetizers! The kawa hagi is a must try üëçüèª Next recommended dish is the beef with teriyaki sauce. Beef was juicy and tender. Not too crowded on a weekend, one of the more affordable robotayaki around, highly recommended!
3
Lunch on last Wednesday. Display without much selections. Missed my order twice. Toufu salad and foeigras steak wasn't served. Tarabagani frozen for some times.. totally out of taste and over cooked. Saga beef bamboo rice was great. Out of my expectation. I thought this will be a great Japanese food. Average.
5
The business set lunches are really value for money at around $25-35. Main dish comes with sashimi, salad, miso soup, rice and pickles. Very cozy Japanese environment too, highly recommended to sit at the counter to watch the Japanese chefs at work if not too many people
5
celebrated bf's birthday there. special truffle cheesecake made for him.
we had the 138 and 188 dinner set.
it was so filling. sashimi is fresh and seasonal foods are the best
Definitely going back for more.
sweet wines are must tries!
5
Will go back for the seared beef roll, bacon wrapped brussel sprouts and truflle sashimi. Service was a bit slow though
5
The lunch set meal was really good. We had chicken and unagi. Both was really good and satisfying! I would definitely my friends to come here for lunch!
4
The cod fish & unagi were delicious, cooked perfectly!
The set lunches are very affordable and I would strongly recommend this place!
5
For me one of the best Japanese restaurants in Asia. The location and restaurant os great. Food and staff outstanding. I would always return!
4
Not easy to find but the search is well worth it. Excellent value set lunch with quite a few choices. Had the minced chicken with onsen egg which I enjoyed. Service was good and pleasant. Will be back.
3
The food was ordinary at best and the chef put way too much sauce on the grilled cod that it was not edible on its own.
4
I know this place for a while but dared not to try due to the high price tag for dinner. Finally I got the chance to try their lunch sets, which have a lot of options compared to a lot of other Jap restaurants in CBD area. Prices vary from the $20s to say $80s. We sat at the counter - more fun to see the chefs in action and surprisingly, they have a long array of fresh produce for sale! They are top quality and really attempting. The cheaper sets are more grilled stuff, fish, pork, beef and etc. Cooked well and the portion is not shy. The buttered mushroom side dish is weird though, a bit sour to me. Other than that the soup and dessert are both nice. They have some good champagne and sake in stock so I will come back to try some for sure. Will certainly come back more for lunch sets
3
We came in a group of 4 and had the $138 dinner set. Not impressed with the food. We sat at the counter hoping to see the chef at work but i was once again disppointed as i could only see them from the chest up. The ladies who served us were great though
4
I was so surprised to discover this nice restaurant, just a step apart from Raffles Place.Nestled on the 2nd floor, you can‚Äôt see it from the street.Inside you have choice to seat on a normal table or on the counter, which is much recommended if you want to feel like in Japan: the particularly neat decoration, with many items, sake drums, fresh vegetables just displayed above the counter, the cooks behind it preparing the dishes.The food is really tasty and the set lunch affordable. We choose the mackerel as a main dish, which came with a small salad, a miso soup, 3 slices of salmon sashimi, cooked mushrooms, pickles and rice. And as we ordered 2 sets, we had a complimentary cooked dish (we choose salmon teriyaki).The dessert is not included in the set, but you can have a scoop of ice-cream or Japanese cheesecake for $4 only.The staff is also professional and we spent a nice lunch time
4
A hard-to-find hideaway just in between circular road and north canal road at Boat Quay. Foods are great and Japanese Robata style is so fun even just watching chef to serve foods. Kinda place you might wanna take someone special.
5
This place serves the best Gyu Don I've ever had! The express business lunch is value for money.....
5
This restaurant is such a hidden treasure, but true foodies always manage to find it! I've been to lunch here a few times, never disappointed about the food, though a couple of times I couldn't get a table just by walking in :(This time I decided to have dinner here with friends. Quiet & relaxed ambience, convenient location right next to boat quay, truly unique food prep & serve. All my friends were quite impressed about the Jpn-style grilled meat & seafood & veg, and we managed to finish 2 bottles of sake with the meal. We'll be back again for sure
4
Boisterous and loud it was not, this place is not about the authentic robataya experience but more on the quality of ingredients and the skills at the grill. Think of the sushi counter being replaced by racks of produce, waiting for you to pick what you fancy or willing to try. The grilling was excellent, with simple seasoning with salt or non at all to bring out the freshness and natural flavors of each ingredients. The sashimi that came with my omakase was very good, in terms of freshness, thickness and cut, so much so that it puts many other places to shame, giving credence to chef Patrick for bringing in quality items from Japan 4 times a week
3
Atypical setup for a Jap restaurant, great display of food at the counter, nice ambience. Enjoyed the a-la-carte fried squid tentacles, grilled ox-tongue and striploin rolls. Of the Omakase menu, impressed with the pairing of amberjack with truffle and enjoyed the presentation of the Grilled Turbo Clams. However, did not like the grilled veg (Yasai moriwase). Liked their good selection of sake.Service staff was attentive but, was unable to explain the ingredients or pairings featured in the Omakase menu. Chef wasn't engaging and did not "sell" items on what was otherwise a great display of ingredients at the counter.Was stumped with a 4-digit dinner bill for 7 adults & 3 children! Overall felt it was overpriced even for this quality of food. For example, the Saga Gyu Donburi on a-la-carte was $65 with a stingy portion of beef. Worth a try only for the luxury of taste
4
This restaurant is a robataya specialist and is packed with a bustling lunchtime office crowd from nearby office buildings. It offers very reasonable value for money lunch sets with good quality. The beef set in particular is excellent although I had the Saba fish which was also good. It is highly recommended to book in advance if you are planning to come for lunch on weekdays as the restaurant is not large and is usually full. It has never disappointed me so far

I visited Tamashii Robataya with my colleagues last friday. The ambience was nice. Owner has a good eye for design. We had the set lunch which was really value for money. It started off well. The food was good. Halfway through our meals, the restaurant got really busy and that was when things began to go downhill.The waitress asked us to move to the sofa area for our desserts without explaining why. We can see that there are people waiting for our table so that is perfectly fine. However, no one tended to us after we moved to the sofa. We had to ask for tea and our bill a couple of times. I mentioned this to the waitress in a nice way and she just looked at me blankly. This is one japanese restaurant with no omotenashi
4
From simple dishes to more complex flavours, Tamashii Robataya executes them with a delicate balance. The culinary skills enhance the freshness of the different ingredients and hits all the right notes for me, at least. Service is great, which makes the dining experience much more pleasant. The one gripe - you'll walk out smelling like food, but it's a small sacrifice and I would do it again.

Went for lunch on a weekday and had the set lunch. I ordered the grilled beef, and while it was very tasty and perfectly cooked, the meat was a little too fatty for my liking. Probably personal taste. I had feedback from my friends that the Unagi is fantastic, as well as some of the dishes. I also had the truffle chawanmushi which is fantastic
5
I visited Tamashii Robataya with a friend during our lunch hour and was blown away. The restaurant offers a Robatayaki experience which was superb. One side of the restaurant is taken up by the open kitchen, where you can watch the chefs prepare your food from the fresh Japanese ingredients that are also laid out for you to see. After watching my dish being cooked, it was then served on a wooden oar- apparently in homage to Japanese fishermen. The whole thing was done very well, all the ingredients were fresh giving the food an excellent flavour and the atmosphere was spot-on, well worth a visit to satisfy some Japanese cravings!
