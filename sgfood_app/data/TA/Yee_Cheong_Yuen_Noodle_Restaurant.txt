This noodle shop is located in Holland V specialising in Ipoh style chicken hor fun. The chicken meat is quite tender but the texture of the noodle is not as rich to leave a memorable impression on your teeth, although the price is reasonable.

Comfort food for those missing Ipoh food. It's not a 100% match but think it's a good temp crave satisfaction still.
Amidst the food presentation ... Or the lack of it ! Taste amazing still .

A Ipoh Hor Fun costs S$4.80. A set which includes Ipoh Hor Fun, a small dumpling soup and a barley or Luo Han Guo drink costs $8.50. The Ipoh Hor Fun is not too salty even the sauce looks dark. It is tasty enough. The service is patient and good. The eatery is clean and spacious. They also Rice with roasted meat, chicken as well as Claypot Rice. I would love to return to try the Claypot Rice. Yee Cheong Yuen Noodle Restaurant offers affordable food amongst the restaurants.

This used to be a simple shop without aircon, but the owners have renovated and made it into a modern aircon restaurant.They are known for their chicken Ipoh hor fun.During my visit, I ordered the shredded chicken hor fun in curry soup. The hor fun was very silky and the curry broth was light but tasty - very nice.I also tried the homemade carrot cake but it was soggy and tasteless

Your eatery continues to provide bad service. I have to wait for some time before my order is taken. More time before my drink arrived. And, somehow, families which arrived later than I gotten their food 1st. If your eatery is not keen to serve single customers, put a notice at the counter and I take my money elsewhere. You may have a reputation of making silky chicken, but when your service sucks, you won't take your business far. By the way, your food is not as good as described on your big signboard

Ordered the Set B which includes a wanton dumpling soup and dry roasted duck noodles and a drink.The noodles were decent but the sauce can be improved. It's texture was abit too watery and there wasn't enough taste to it. However the duck was very good and tender with nice outer skin. Overall it is a value for money Asian food location which can be considered if u are looking for some roast meat Hor fun.

This is the third week in Singapore for business.. My SG friends bring me to grab a lot of good food in SG.. Overall, SG food is nice, but I still have not chance go to Malaysia, yet I wish to try Malaysian food. So my friend bring me to Yee Cheong Yuen for Malaysian style ho fun, ho fun is kind of flat rice noodle. There are serving noodle and ho fun as their signature dishes with gravy, curry and clear soup. Btw, I love their ho fun v gravy, don't forget about the braised duck, which is really silky and delicious.Besides, I also love the curry soup there, the orange color curry soup is really nice too.. MUST TRY !! After I finished these yummy food, I just know about this restaurant v the recipe have more than 30 years history, the staff ( Maxx) told me about this and recommend me go back for other good dishes such as roasted pork and carrot cake.. I like his friendly service and attentive serving way to all the diners there.. Good job.. I ll be back..

Great place to satisfy one's Ipoh Hor Fun craving if you don't have time to travel all the way to Ipoh! Ordered the standard set which is great value as it includes a drink and dumpling soup. We also were enticed to try the Ngoh Hiang and Claypot Chicken Rice, both were good and worth repeating. Most notable was the great service! Highly recommended if you need an aircon place for a hearty lunch!

A visit there every time will definitely order their silky chicken. The soya chicken is also a good choice to go with either rice or hor fun.If you order their claypot rice, do make sure you have a partner to share with you as the portion is really huge.Roast pork and char siew is another option to put on your order if you are still have space to include them.Da bao back their yam cake home for your breakfast too
