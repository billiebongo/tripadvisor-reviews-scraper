The set lunch is very worth it and food was really good! Service staff were friendly and accommodating even though the service could afford to be a little faster

One of a very small number of dining outlets at the Yishun Safra Club, Food was really average - the steak I ordered not quite cooked to the medium-well quality I asked for. Restaurant was quiet and service staff attentive.

the food is good and presentable especially the dessert. The only sad thing is there were a few items we ordered that were out of order.

The food was good and value for money. Service and ambiance was ok but could be better improve. Worth coming with family.

Cheaper than Jack's Place, but this place can hold its ground. Popular enough for celebrations such as birthdays and anniversaries. Price wise: mid range and reasonable for the portion and quality.Overall service is good, but constantly understaffed. Hard at times to get the attention of the waiters because they are really so busy!Dont forget to bring your SAFRA Card

They serve family style western food with some Asian favorites. The outlet by the pool has a nice view compared to many others. They recently revamped the menu and although prices has increased , quality of the steak has also increased. A relax family western meal during lunch time, as their set lunches are value for money.

Ordered a set meal for steak and seafood platter for dinner. The steak was ok. However the seafood platter was a total disappointment. Although told by the staff that the items were all fried, it seems that when they served it, it consists of those you would have bought from the freezer section and just fry them. Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t ever order this

We frequent this eatery. Has always love the food and the servers were very quick and responsive. Unfortunately we met this lady who took our order last week. All I asked was to change the mushroom soup to the daily soup since I ordered the main and could top up to make it a set. I overheard her complaining to the kitchen that I confused her as I made a lot of changes to my order which wasn't true. Even if this was true, please be professional about it
