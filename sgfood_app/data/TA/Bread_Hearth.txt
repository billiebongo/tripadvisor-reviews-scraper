We found this little gem ideal for breakfast in the morning, the Village Hotel Restaurant was too expensive for our means. Service good, food always hot!!

We had cakes and coffee with a group of friends.
Some of the cakes were above average but some was poor.
Service is average.

Good value for money -- tasty, not too sweet and filling. Dined in the first time and the waiting time was at least 15 minutes. Rather frustrating wait although the cafe wasn't crowded on a Sunday morning. Takeaway the second time and waiting time was bearable at 5 minutes

This is smack right in the middle of Katong V mall, and makes for a good place to chill by yourself or to catch up with friends. I paid a visit as my daughter was taking a class at one of the few enrichment centres located within the mall. The food was decent, but nothing spectacular, and a bit pricey for the quality.

Located in an open space on the 2nd level of the mall, this artisanal bakery cafe is easily accessible via the escalator. Find a seat, place your orders at the counter (menu on the counter), make payment and you are given a table number wooden block.Its pastry and bakery items are attractively displayed. We ordered the Raisin Roll, Tomato and Olive Focaccia and a Hazelnut Latte; to complete the meal. A craving for pasta saw my partner and I trying the Vegetarian Pasta, served with a huge mushroom that covered almost half the plate. It was crowded for a Saturday afternoon, so we considered ourselves quite lucky that we managed to get a table

I love the coffee and their croissants as well as fresh sandwiches prepared by them. Located on the lobby level adjacent to the Village Hotel in Katong, this is a cozy deli offering fresh finger bites and deli food. Crowded during afternoon time due to students doing their homework, it is definitely a worth visit place if you want to enjoy a nice coffee and small bites in a comfortable cozy ambienc

Bread & Hearth is located in a mall, next to a math enrichment class centre. As a foreigner, it was quite interesting for me to see the daily nature of that business. With regards to Bread & Hearth, I believe in terms of waiting times improvements could be made. The biggest downside from my point of view is that the toasts should have more ingredients added and the ratio of the few ingredients relative to the amount of bread should be adjusted (not enough of ingredients, and also not enough variety). If they manage to improve the quality of the dishes and stick to the concept, then it could become quite a crowded place, I believe. The staff of Bread & Hearth is friendly and helpful

I visited this cafe at 10am on a Tuesday. I ordered a latte and poached eggs with portobello mushrooms on toast. There were about 8 other customers in the cafe, most of whom had their food and were having coffee already. My latte took 15 minutes to get to me. That said, it was good. Well-prepared. My food order took 30 minutes. The poached eggs arrived hard-boiled. The mushrooms were charred/burnt. Not likely to return here for the food. Perhaps only for the coffee.

Opens early and the place is quiet before 9.30am on weekends. Inside the shopping mall Katong V and most shops not opened yet. You can read a book quietly, do some work or have a chat with small group of friends or family. Most of the seatings are 2 or 4 people. There is no bar seating. Order their signature breakfast. It takes some time to come but it is recommended.

Stopped in for a coffee and a breakfast. Food was cooked perfect. It a little coffee shop in the open area but the coffee was good. I have seen a lot of little shops in this location. I hope they survive. If they don't it won't be because of the food quality
