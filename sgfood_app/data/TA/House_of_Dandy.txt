This is a gem that I'm glad I discovered while in Singapore. The cocktails are well thought out and crafted! I would highly recommend for anyone that loves a unique cocktail and great service! Also, best price for quality in Singapore!

A beautiful cocktail bar that challenges your senses the moment you enter it. The smell, the decorations, the music and the cocktails are all part of a wholesome experience.

I really liked the atmosphere in here although it might be a bit dark. Friendly bar staff and extensive cocktail list. Will go back as it is a nice place in the centre of town.

Was at house of dandy to celebrate a friends birthday. Absolutely love the ambience and vibe. Perfect place to just be laid back and do a lot of catching up with friends with not so loud music. The bartenders there are pretty cheerful.

You can find this bar on tras street among many Korean restaurants. Nice decor and solid drinks. Friendly service staff.

a local friend brought me here and I really liked the vibe of "House of Dandy"...it's not pretentious, doesn't want to be "hip & trendy", the regulars who come here are pretty laid back, a bit on the pricey side but what's not expensive in Singapore...we did a bit of bar hopping along Tras St. but this was the one we enjoyed our time the most.

This has a similar feel to Cufflink Club. But you can smell the leather as you walk into this very masculine, 'gentleman's club' style place. I hope that doesn't fade over time. Call me old fashioned but I wasn't wild about the choice of music - it didn't seem to fit the environment. I had a double bourbon and my partner had a house cocktail which she really enjoyed. We were $56 lighter for the privilege but that's no more than you'd pay in a hotel bar and that waft of leather is worth it
