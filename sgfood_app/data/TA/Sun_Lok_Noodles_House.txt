An authentic HK Cafe in the most unexpected place. Food is very similar to what you will find in Crystal Jade or Imperial Treasure... At a discount :-)
Check out the porridge and dim sum.

They are presently in 321 mall located in Clementi. Do note that it is NOT Blk 321 Clementi.The dishes are generally well priced and of good quality. Dim sum are available throughout which is great for kids. Their porridge is super smooth and well flavored. Noodle is cooked al dente which is pleasing to me. Beef brisket which is their specialty is good but there are times, they comes in bits and pieces. Roast pork and char Siew are very good as well. Overall a good value venue for families.

This place is situated inside the Superbowl Jurong and next to Sheng Siong at Yuan Ching Road.The food served is of exquisite and excellent quality on top of the authenticity of a true Hong Kong eatery in Singapore. The chef is indeed from Hong Kong!The beef brisket noodle was excellent! The wanton noodle is also of great taste. We ordered some dim sum like the carrot cake, ngoh mai kai, fried wanton, xiao long bao and mantou bread.Even the quality of the Chinese tea was of a high standard!Though small in area and also slightly understaffed, this place can hold out on its own to serve to a busy lunch or dinner crowd. Just do be patient with the elderly waitresses

Bought by our local friends to this HK Noodles House. The menu looks quite HK. The food is so so. We had some Tim Sum, Fish Congee and Beef Brisket Noodle. However, nothing to shout of. Nevertheless, if those HKers who are really homesick then this cafe should help

I am writing this review just as I am finishing the last bite of my shrimp dumpling noodle dish. It was fresh and delicious. My colleagues and I have been having our lunches here quite often over the past two years as this is quite close to our office. The dishes we usually order range between 5 - 9 SGD, but there more expensive choices as well. I have never left the restaurant disappointed :) I think they use good and fresh ingredients

My family has been enjoying the food here for many years, when it was in Jurong East and for some time now at Taman Jurong. This is food that's great for folks who love traditional Chinese food. The dim sum is satisfying with a small variety including the mandatory siew mai and har got. The noodle dishes are available with just about everything in the kitchen but the duck gets my vote. My favorites, the Cantonese style porridge, the pork liver, and of course tripe (small intestines) in sauce. The folks who run the place are have maintained most of their staff and that's part of the charm. It's more than a good meal, it's a wholesome experience.
