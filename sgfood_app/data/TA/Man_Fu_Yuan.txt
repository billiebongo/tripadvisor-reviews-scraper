Very pricey for Chinese cuisine~ Expected better quality of food since it's a hotel restaurant dining but both the service & quality of food is below par~
5
Was served by a friendly cheerful staff. She recommended 2 dishes to us and they turned out tastefully great. Will visit the restaurant again to try other dishes!
3
Took them a long time to serve the dishes . Dim sum have limited choices. They should review to add more new dishes to the menu
4
Excellent Dim Sum. Pricey but it’s fine dining after all. The dishes were high quality and worth the price!
4
The service was excellent for a group of 6 of us. Food was recommended by staff and quality of food was good.
3
Service is excellent as always and the environment is quiet and relaxing. However, the quality of the food has declined, since my last three visits. Out of the 5 dishes that we ordered, none of them were up to the previous standards :(

Goodness. Utterly disappointed with their radish cake. Firstly, it is way too small for its price. It's contained in a small rectangular takeaway box. Secondly, the radish cake was totally frozen upon collection. When asked if it was made fresh, staff said yes. Then again, why freeze it when it's fresh and how can it be freshly made when it's as hard as stone! So embarrassing giving it as a gift that doesn't symbolise 圆圆满满and the whole cake was covered with ice frost when given to the elderly. It's my first purchase and never would I purchase from them again. Also, I left a feedback 3 days ago and got no response on why the radish cake was frozen when it was made fresh that day. Buyers beware
4
This is my second family lunch at the restaurant and while the food quality and portions remain good, service standards are still lacking. Price point is a little on the high side thus be prepared to spend about $200 for dim sum lunch for a familly of 5.Service is a little slow and cold. Staff are either shorthanded or find no need to offer the equivalent of service (to restaurant class and price point) which is a pity.Some of the recommended dishes are the glutinous rice, siew mai and claypot tofu, which were delicious

After a long flight, had a quiet meal with my wife at the Intercon Hotel Cantonese Restaurant. The mixed barbecue platter, & Ee Fu braised noodles were decent enough; whilst the salt & pepper fried calamari was below par.Service was efficient.If you are particular about Chinese cuisine, there are better restaurants around
2
Been a few years since I eaten here. But since it was a NY treat, I came. Oh.....the standard of cantonese food here is so very disappointing. One would expect it to be passable but it's sadly not.For the price it charges, best to eat elsewhere.Besides the food, the restaurant setting and ambience is ok. Located in Intercontinental Hotel and above the Bugis MRT station, it is conveniently located.However, given a choice, I'll go elsewhere for cantonese food in Singapore
5
Excellent Dim Sum. The chef recommended tea flavored duck is very good. The service is great. We have a last minute request to celebrate a birthday and the accommodate by providing us with “sou tao”
5
The dim sum ... always good, have not been disappointed to date. My third time here. Go for the steamed stuff, they are better than the baked ones. Service is consistently good, attentive, prompt and efficient.
4
Food is very good.
Service attentive.
Price is on the above average to high end range
Will visit again
5
The location of the restaurant is really convenient to me and my family, the service from the staff was always attention to details, friendly and warm. Especially Maggie, Carmen and Kris. Will visit again soon.
5
The service is impeccable. The waiter who was serving us has great attention to details. The signature duck is a must-try!
5
I had a gathering with ex/colleagues at Man Fu Yuan. Good Ambience , The dim sum was super delicious, good quality & price is not too expensive. Highly recommended as compared With Crystal Jade, imperial ...
2
The restaurant is beautiful but the service is substandard. We ordered the roasted meat platter and we have to remind them twice before it was being served. This should be the first dish to be served yet it became the last. Taste wise, nothing spectacular. The deep fried fish skin salted egg yolk was mediocre and you can hardly taste the salted egg yolk. There are only two desserts available that night even though the menu listed five. After trying the food, we thought it is better to give it a miss.The service was unsatisfactory and not friendly. More like business as usual, just a job.Given a choice, I would rather patronize other restaurants than to eat there again. Simply not worth it
3
My 3rd visit to Man Fu Yuan. The place is nice; reminiscent of a restored shophouse with its low ceilings and wide use of wood. However food is rather average for the price (our lunch cost ~$65/pax before discount with quite a few dim sum dishes). Service was good though.
4
Overall, the food was good. The cod fish, 3 cups chicken was good. The beef cheeks with daikon was ok. The food is not too salty and healthy but variety on the menu was limited as we were informed that this is their new menu. We would have preferred the old menu. The service and ambience is good
3
Was not bad, just that with a few good experiences previously, the restaurant has set a high bar for itself. Unfortunately, it failed to hit those lofty levels today. First, they ran out of duck. Then they ran out of chicken. Then the third dish we ended up replacing those with (prawn) came, but it was not prepared the right way. In between one of the waiters came by to inform us they were out of chicken, but disappeared before I could inform them of my replacement order. They did have good service recovery though, by offering us free dessert and parking. However, we were still disappointed to learn that the menu had just been changed in early December. The favourites we enjoyed previously were no longer prepared the same way we were used to. Hope the restaurant will consider bringing back old beef cheeks dish. We’ll certainly consider coming back again despite today’s disappointment as even the best restaurants can have the odd bad day now and then
5
Had a meal here last Sunday for brunch, service was excellent and memorable from the staff. Food was average though.
5
It was an enjoyable evening with good service. Food was exquisite and tasty. Portions rather dainty: A few surprising small.
4
Went on Friday lunch. Quiet function room, good service, frequent tea refill without requesting, tasty food with big portion serving, highly recommend crispy pork belly, crunchy asparagus, and hot crispy delicious custard ball dessert.
4
Food was pricey, but service was attentive and food was good. The most memorable dish of the night would have to be the Peking duck.
5
Food was great, however service was a bit slow due to lack of manpower. Will go back there again! Great for dates and family gathering
4
food was ok but some food like 3 entry meat could have been better cut.
Example- Char shiew should be cut to smaller slice rather than provide big chunk of meat.
3
First time having dinner at Man Fu Yuan in the Intercontinental Singapore Hotel. Was not impressed with the food; the dishes we had tasted ordinary and not worth their price tags. Underwhelming.We had their signature fried rice ($26) with crabmeat and scallop which was bland and after the manager portioned out the rice for 5, each bowl was barely half full. The asparagus dish was expensive at $22. We also had the pork belly ($18), yellow melon seafood soup ($18/portion) and signature chicken in red wine dish ($22)
5
Great to see familiar faces - Kenneth, Maggie and Carmen. 6 star service from them. Generally, excellent serviceWe had lobster noodles, prawn, scallops and asparagus in black truffle sauce and baked sea perch. For dessert, we had almond tea. 6 stars for the Chef and teamGreat to be back after a long absence
4
Its our 1st visit at this restaurant due to the 50% voucher given by Amex. We booked on Sunday 2pm but when we reached there the table was not ready and we waited till 2.15pm and last order was at 2.45pm. This restaurant is really short of manpower as we noticed there was tables but just that no workers to set it up. The front desk lady did compensated us complimentary dessert at the end of the meal and allowed us to stay a bit longer till 3.30pm though operation hours is till 3.15pm. Food not bad, just that a bit expensive if without the 50% voucher. Atmosphere good
2
All quests did not like the food quality & quanity. Tim sum was half served. Steamed live fish was half cooked. ....... so many problems. Wonder if they know what they are serving.
5
The food is really good! The staffs were extremely friendly and attentive . I would recommend anyone who wants to try good Chinese cusine here . But it’s abit pricey so it’s not a Everyday place to visit. Probably special occasions
3
Food so so compared to same range restaurants like Imprerial Treasures, Wan Hao. Service is slow. Constantly got to ask for tea refill, plate changes or extra cutlery.
5
Food is good. Service from staff is excellent. Deposit is not required for special order such as suckling pig.
4
Attentive waitresses always ready to serve. The food taste is up to restaurant standard and the price is reasonable
5
We had dim sum for lunch utilizing our AMEX 50% discount coupon and hence it was not too expensive for us. The food was great and the staff very attentive to us, constantly keeping our cups filled with tea. We love the seafood congee. The ingredients were extremely fresh and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.

I didnt have high expectations of this place as its not very well known despite their acclaimed awards. Anyhow since I had the amex voucher for 50% off all a la carte food I said why not. This will be my first and last time at this restaurant. lets start my experience here. I arrive exactly at the time of my booking. There was NO ONE at the front desk! For 15-20mins there was literally no one there to show us to our table, take numbers. As a result a line started form outside. There was one possible trainee lady who said she is coming dont worry. She was obviously not trained to read /click on the computer regarding reservations at the restaurant. She repeated to me and another group 2-3x someone is coming. But she made no effort to really contact anyone to come. She was more interested in memorizing the menu items or for some reason was really focused on the menu. So everyone waited. Despite people looking into the restaurant showing that there were a lot of people outside waiting to go in no one came out! What ridiculous and outrageous sad service/behavior. Eventually we were shown to our table. We were lucky that they offered us one of the "pseudo private rooms" otherewise a private room requires 200$/person spending, which is also ludacris for a restaurant of such mediocre standard. Anyways, as we were waiting for the other members of the group to come I decided to order a beer. After about 10mins the finally bought me my beer. The area where the room service is is severely understaffed. Although the staff is nice, there are just not enough staff and service is a super slow. I think if i went downstairs to 7-11 to buy a beer it would have been faster. Then the best part is the 2nd round , when I wanted to order a beer again. They ran out! HAHAHA I have never heard of a hotel restaurant ran out of beer. Ludacris. This of course was only relayed to me after I had ask the waiter what is taking so long for my beer. So after that ordeal we waited for the food the come. That took about 30min-45mins. Perhaps I should have taken the initiative and gone into the kitchen cooked the food myself and bought it out. Finally when the dishes arrived there was no introduction by the serving staff what dish is what. They just placed it on our table and left in a hurry. Good job staff! very professional! NOT! No plates were changed in between courses. Requesting for more chilli sauce took another 5-10mins. The whole dinner dragged on for about 3.5hrs.. just exhausting to eat at this restaurant. To add insult to injury they took finished plates from the room next door and used our service desk in our room to help clean the dirty dishes from the other room. I am completely speechless with this. And lastly being a hotel restaurant of course the menu items are not cheap but that is expected. but the Food was nothing extraordinary. It was average at best. Maybe the fried rice was good. The portion size were average. However with the 50% voucher its at best satisfactory to come here for that price. However with no voucher, forget it. Don't waste your time / money here.Btw , in order to get free parking you have to spend 150$ / free parking coupon. Also another joke. Stay away until the F&B manager of this hotel does something about it. However looking at the previous reviews it seems little improvement has been made and similar complaints like myself written. Probably advised to forward this to the GM of the Hotel as the F&B manager may lack the competence here to do anything about it

Went on a Sunday around 2pm. It was very crowded. It took quite a while about 30 to 45mins for the food to be served. But its worth the wait! We ordered mainly dimsum and the quality is good and tasty! Loved the fried carrot cake, chicken pie and char siew sou. Man Fu Yuan fried rice was good too but the ee fu noodle so so. Rice roll is too thick for our liking. Food size is good for 3 to 4 pax. Most dim sum comes in 3.We had the 5 element tea and it went very well with our food. The tea is very nice.Very nice ambiance. We were served by a very bubbly and friendly young short haired lady. Its has been a while since we have seen such good service staff. Quite a pricey meal but worth for special occasion. Restaurant served weekend Dim Sum buffet at $58++ so its a good deal if you are a big eater. Better to make reservation for weekend
4
We were staying at the Intercontinental Hotel which is where the restaurant is located. We wanted to try their dim sum which is one of their specialities. However, dim sum is only served at lunch time here, useful to know. The service was attentive and friendly. The food was extremely good; I recommend trying their signature dishes for something a little different, though not cheap. Our waiter advised us that portion sizes are fairly large, but still we had more food than you could shake a (chop) stick at. The wine was very expensive, though I realise it has to travel a long way I still think it is too highly priced. I would still happily eat there again
2
Dim sum are just average. Ordered the lobster Cheong fun and it tasted awful (really salty). The Har gau siu Mai are also just average. I think I'd try summer palace next since it's supposed to be the best Dim sum place in Singapore.
5
A friend recommended this place for dinner. Every dish served was really delicious and the flavors were well balanced and savoury. It's a great place for both family celebrations or work dinner.
5
Food were delicious and waiting time was just nice. Service were excellent too! A good place for a family dinner or even a celebration with the family!
5
Food was excellent, and service was fast, efficient and friendly. Wait staff are attentive and engage in friendly banter with guests.
3
Setting was nice but not worth the value. Very expensive for just slightly average Chinese food. Go only if there are promos.
1
First of all the food itself is good, however the service is terrible and i will not be back for sure.We have spent more than $550 for a meal with a group of 6 and we ordered quite a lot of dishes, it was ok even though the waitress were not attentive - need to call their attention for get more tea, change the plates - which is not acceptable for restaurant in a 5 stars hotel!The main issue was after we have paid and checked the receipt, realized one of the appetizers (lychee meat) didn't serve at all, therefore we flagged out to the manager and he said he will credited back to our credit card. 5 minutes later, he came back with a waitress and said he has checked with this waitress that the dish has been served! But the truth is it didn't serve at all, and the tone that she talked to us sounds like that we were lying!We were extremely angry and disappointed about the way that the manager (a guy who wear glasses) who handled the issue:1. The dish is only $22 and it total bill is over $550, do you think 6 of us were lying?2. The restaurant was understaffed yesterday night, they didn't assign 1 or 2 waiter / waitress to each table or section, so we have different waiter/ waitress to serve the dishes. How could the manager only asked one particular waitress about this dish???As a 5 starts hotel / restaurant, they should have handled it better. For the benefit of doubt, he should just credit back to us instead of questioning the customers.The end of the day we were very angry and didn't want the refund as this is an insult!DO NOT go to that restaurant unless you want to have a poor service
5
Was here recently, first was impressed with the decor of Intercontinental Hotel and their In house dining of this Chinese restaurant was impressive. The staff are warm and pleasant, very prompt in clearing our plates and refilling our pot of tea, making sure we had everything. The Tim Sum we order was yummy & excellent, everything was fresh. We loved the smoked tea duck, skin was crispy and aromatic. Fully recommend this place for Tim Sum. They have also won few medal for their foo
5
Celebrated mother's birthday and was thoroughly impressed with the quality of the food from the ala carte menu. Decently priced for the quality offered. Soup of the Day though lowest priced ($10 each) was delicious (Papaya, Fungus, Tomato and Pork Ribs). Wasabi Prawns were decently sized and tasty. Black Pepper Beef was not overcooked, relatively tender and flavourful. Trio Combination Egg Vegetable dish was also extremely tasty. Restaurant offered complimentary longetivity buns which was a nice gesture. Most impressed by the excellent service rendered, especially by Captain Mr Kenneth Chong Kok Keong who was extremely attentive, patient and helpful in more ways than one
5
Went there for weekend Dim Sum, had the ala carte menu (not buffet).Har gao skin was translucent , prawns were plump and crunchy. What impressed was the phoenix claw with XO saunce, its infused with rich flavor of XO dried shrimp and scallop with each tiny morsel. Service was good.Cost $85 for 2 pax but the food we ordered was easily enough to feed 3 pax and hence we packed back the leftovers. Must orders, Har Gao, Siew Mai, Phoenix claws, steamed pork ribs, crispy beancurd skin with prawns, porridge
2
Went there for lunch with my family. The quality has dropped. Ordered a Peking duck and some dim sum. The Peking duck was precut. Normally, they will first show you the duck and sliced in front of you but not here. Waited half an hour before first dish appear. The dim sum pastry was thick. The hashima dessert tasted awful or rather bitter as there was too much longans (hardly any hashima) cooked with the american ginseng. The service was so slow. I see there are quite a number of staff but everybody seems to be busy but with what I am not sure. We waited another half an hour for the dessert though we have ordered in advance. Anyway, we will not be going back there again
3
My second time there for the dim sum. They are still good. But service was not as good this time. It was not crowded so I cannot understand the drop in service level. Had to wait a while to be served. My pot of tea was taken away for refills but never returned until a few reminders. Could have been a better experience.
4
Food portion too small especially fish dishes.Quality of food is good. Ambience is very good - best for entertaining guest.
5
The dim sum buffet at Man Fu Yuan is quite a steal at $58++ with lobster and other dishes, on top of the wide variety of dim sum. Love their deep fried salted egg yolk buns as well
3
We stayed at intercontinental and had dinner here. The dishes were tasty and authentic but due to the location more pricey .
Staff were attentive and would come again
3
First experience and felt food was average. Atmosphere is noisy and Price is not cheap for average food. Will not return.
4
Good variety of dishes. Service was courteous and prompt. Portions a little small though for price charged. Hope they will increase the portions a bit more as price is not cheap.
4
Not only is this restaurant reasonably priced, but using the AMEX 50% discount voucher makes it even more worth the trip.
5
It has been awhile since I last visited Man Fu Yuan. Thus I decided to pay this restaurant a visit, bringing along with me, a few guests.Being a Tuesday night, the restaurant wasn't too busy. I was met by the Manager Ms Joanne Lai. I informed her that I would be having a dinner/discussion, and she promptly offered me a quiet table, away from the music from the lobby lounge.Service was prompt and our needs were very well taken care of. Our plates were changed more frequently than I had intended/ expected and our petite tea cups were never empty.I had requested for a few vegetarian dishes and I was pleasantly surprised with the suggestions by Ms Lai and of course, execution by the chef. Even my meat-loving guests admitted that the vegetarian dishes were unique and flavorful.The rest of our dishes were Signature recommendations and we were indeed spoilt for choice. All the dishes ordered that night were fresh, tasty, and well presented.Only drawbacks were that the air-conditioning was really cold, and we over-ordered (leaving us with much to take-away)!Nonetheless, it was a lovely dining experience on Tuesday night, and it is one restaurant that we will be returning to, in the near future. Thank you once again, Ms Joanne Lai, for your warm hospitality
5
Impressive tea selection that I would do a tea tasting with (if offered). The dishes are unique in their composition and I attribute that to a fusion bent. Overall, great ambience with reasonable pricing to match, at least if you were to compare the resto to eating group giants like Tung Luk. Would revisit to try some of their other dishes. And TEA of course
5
For buffet, there was a wide range of dim sum to choose from. The seafood was very fresh. The dum sum was delicate and well executed. Truly raise the bar for fine dining. The service was prompt. Overall it was an enjoyable afternoon brunch with families.
4
We ordered prawn cook in cereal, prawn is freah. zheng Jiang pai gu is tender and juicy. We had the calamari with salted egg sauce..Is very crispy n nice. On top of these, we had a Tim sum item, the steam rice roll with char siew is also soft and the fillings is a lot. Also had the hua tiao jiu slice chicken which is served cold as it is the appetizer. Fragrance strong in the hua tiao jiu..Which is a kind of liquor. Overall dining experience is good. Value for money
3
Food was generally very average. Ambience of the restaurant was good n generally clean n modern. Not a value proposition.
4
Nice ambience. Restaurant was quite packed on a Sat. Beef brisket was as great as before. The service was good.
5
The service exceeds expectations. Food is great too. Enjoyed the bean curd, roast chicken had perfect crispy skin.
5
Went for a business dinner. Diners were all impressed and excited. Good ambience for business discussion
4
Enjoyed the Peking duck and dim sum. Service was prompt and staff were friendly and helpful. Quite busy during weekday lunchtime after 1230pm. Prices are relatively higher compared to Chinese restaurants nearby. Food was great!
4
Wanted to eat ala carte dim sum but it wasn't clear on the website that they only serve dim sum buffet (no ala carte). Food was good, but super expensive.
3
Overall, food wise is standard, well executed Cantonese fares... Chilli crab meat with mantou is catering to foreigner tastebud with poor resemblance of the iconic dish. Double boiled soup is authentic cantonese taste. But service is a let down as it felt under staff at times
5
I had only one meal and one dish at this restaurant but that one dish was delicious. I found the price to be reasonable by Singapore standards. Before venturing to Man Fu Yuan, I read both trip advisor and Michelin Guide reviews. From the later, I learned that their kitchen staff has remained the same for a long time. To me, this speaks volumes. Wish I was closer so I could try more of their dishes. Delicious Cantonese
5
I was so glad that I could not get my desired time at my first choice restaurant and landed at Man Fu Yuan.Experience was excellent, the food was so genuinely fresh and authentic, cooked to perfection given that the chef was off that weekend, made it even more impressive. Service though not perfect was still considered excellent as we could fee the warmth and sincerity. All I could hear from my family members we sounds/comments of approval all through the lunch except for the Peking duck pre-wrap as per our request. You MUST make Man Fu Yuan your next choice. All I can say is, it's excellent - Amen
5
We would like to share the special menu prepared by Kenneth for a welcoming dinner party for our relatives from Hong Kong on 31st March 2017 including longetivity bun for a birthday celebration too.Two months have passed and they are still talking how warm we were in organising the dinner at a special function room for 12 persons.We strongly recommend Man Fu Yuan at Intercontinental Hotel Singapore for all occasions whether tim sum lunch, dinner or special celebrations.
3
Wide range of dishes and cuisine altho dim sum menu was more limited. Interesting fushion dim sum well executed altho on the pricey side. Service was slow and cold, can be further improved.
2
We were very surprised about the overall quality, or lack thereof, during our experience. Numerous people had commented that we must eat here.
Pepper Beef was great, everything else just so so.
Have been offered a revisit and will then review again.
5
It was a nice family dinner to celebrate my husband's birthday. Food was good, service was good. Recommend to visit and enjoy
4
The ambient is cosy and the temperature is right with only a few tables for seating. It is advisable to have a booking to avoid disappointment.I like the festive dumplings and the seafood soup in young coconut. The taste is great and just right. The salted duck egg prawn is succulent and retain the freshness of prawn.The customer services is attentive
5
We had a 8 course meal at this restaurant and every dish that came out from the kitchen is absolutely commendable. Taste is flavorful yet not being overly salty or sweet. The quality of food is of high standards and service was efficient and professional. All in all, i would highly recommend this place for the quality of food especially if you plan to have a family gathering or birthday dinner
5
I hadn't been back for many years and I was pleasantly surprised by the high standard of the food and the friendly and professional service. The dim sum was juicy and flavourful. The siew mai topped with scallop was so sweet with the flavour of the scallop and the ebiko. The tea smoked duck had such a crispy skin while still being tender. They also have a dim sum buffet, but we had the a la carte menu.While prices are a bit on the higher side, the overall experience, ambience and food are well worth it. Definitely worth the visit if you'reâ€‹ hankering for good Cantonese cuisine
4
The layout of the restaurant is not very good, we were shown to our table in a room in a decluded corner. The room was serviced by 2 wait staff for 4 big tables. Most of the time the wait staff were running around getting dishes from the kitchen, it was a long while before somebody get our orders. Understand the configuration of the restaurant could be due to the overall layout of the establishment but perhaps the eatery can make up for it using some bell system where each table can press for attention of the staff. The food was nevertheless good
4
As one walks into the restaurant the first thing that catches your eye is the seating / tables layout which is very spacious compared to similar class Chinese restaurant. It gives an "exquisite " atmosphere. As we were there for lunch we ordered mainly timsum dishes plus other cooked food.The timsum dishes were piping hot , with fresh ingredients and delicious. Some recommended dishes include the wasabi prawns,seafood fried crispy noodles and scallops. Prices are on the high end as expected when dining in a 5 star restaurant. Service by staff was excellent
3
Was quite disappointed with their signature fried rice and star garouper. At $180/kg, I'd expect the fish to be freshly caught from the sea instead of it being farm fed. What was nice was the live herbal prawns, smoked duck and salted egg with lychee scallops
4
The restaurant serves dim sum buffet on Sundays and public holidays so I went to try it on Vesak Day with my family. Initially service was brisk but later it literally slowed to a crawl. It's probably because they are understaffed on a public holiday. I was impressed with a fresh lobster baked in superior stock (One order per person) and XO sauce chicken claw. The scallop siew mai and prawn dumpling (har gow) was tasty too. The sliced beef with HK kailan was a little too salty and the meat was a little veiny/chewy. The chicken in rice wine was well seasoned. The chicken pie with mango was refreshing as the acidity and sweetness of the mango meat balanced the savoury flavour of the meat filling. Overall I think I still prefer other hotel dim sum such as Cherry Garden and Hai Tien Lo.
4
went there for a birthday celebration with my family on a friday evening, was seated next to 2 tables who was having a mini company/grp dinner and there were quite loud,
food wise, most dishes were above average
4
not enough hands in the kitchen to serve food fast enough..
food was of high quality though..
price was reasonable with 50% off amex voucher..
4
This is a fantastic Chinese restaurant serving delicious food. Not only is the food good and service attentive but with Amex 50% voucher, truly value for money.
4
The food is great, the service even better. You can taste the quality of the fresh ingredients in the dim sum. We liked the siew mai most. Never tasted real scallop with them before. The shrimps in the har gao were succulent and generous too. The service was impeccable. I prefer ordering thru the menu to that from the dim sum cart. The server will time your dishes to make sure you get them hot. It was most enjoyable
4
We haven't been here for a while and was pleasantly surprised at how spacious the tables are now at the renovated restaurant. The service was great and although there was a mix-up between the reservation desk and the restaurant to prepare the longevity bun for my mum's birthday, they recovered very quickly to ensue that the miscommunications does not disrupt the surprise for my mum. The dim sum dishes were all delicious and the modern dim sum menu provides exciting eats although I have to say that the wait for the dishes was a tad long by most chinese restaurants' standards
4
Waited about 30-40 min for the first dish which was a little long. The food was quite good, though perhaps a little too pricey. The wasabi prawns were really good though pricey, and the chee cheong fun with scallops were good value. The har kau was good as well.
5
We were here for weekend lunch (2 of us), and were served by Queenie and Maggie 2 lovely ladies who provided exceptional VIP service. So THANKS to my friend, our table received the VIP treatment lol. This is an interesting concept because i believe for a restaurant to not only serve good food, knowing and appreciating their VIP customers is a form of exceptional service standards which i think is not a common practice in the food industry. Now onto the food.. I particularly love the salmon sashimi with caviar, it was a complimentary starter dish and the meat was fresh and Q. Both of us love the corn soup and stirfry carrot cake.. the scallop siew mai was something different yet nice to have on the dim sum menu. To sum up, the food quality somehow did match up to its pricey standards and just in case u are wondering how much its dim sum, it would be like 2.5x more the average dim sum places like THW, 闻到食(126) or hua nam. The menu here is definitely more exquisite with rare items like scallop salmon being used and the kind of service you won't get in the average dim sum places. Last but not least, we would like to commend the staffs coordinating effort in getting our table a slice of bday cake! A casual mention by this VIP friend resulted in a sweet gesture like that. Appreciated!
3
This restaurant is kind of small, with 15 tables (mostly 6-8 people). The staff here is super efficient in their work, but it also made you feel busy and not relaxing compare to dining in other hotel. A little noisy as the ceiling is not too high. Location of this restaurant is great, right in the heart of Bugis. Food is ok, normal Chinese food and dim sum.
5
We wanted to eat at Man Fu Yuan on a Saturday night, and they were able to fit us in on short notice. We met Joanne, the Assistant Guest Relations Manager, and she made recommendations for the most popular dishes. We were shown to a nice table for two in the back of the dining area. We followed all of her suggestions and shared an order of pepper beef with fried mantou. We had two desserts: mango sago pudding with ice cream dollops and the purple sweet potato and custard dessert. We felt the service and food were an excellent value. Our server, Queenie, was especially helpful and cheerful. My wife asked for sambal, and we paid for a small dish of sambal of dried scallops, salty fish, shrimp, and peppers prepared in a large batch by the chef during Chinese New Year. It was delicious. We asked about the sour plum drink and they brought us each a shot glass of sour plum drink. We feel that if you know what to order, Man Fu Yuan is an excellent value

Went there to celebrate a special occasion. Ours was a dinner course with four dishes and a dessert. The quality of food served was top grade - easily 1-2 Michelin Star quality. Besides the food, the service was also top notch, notably the manager, Evelyn who displayed passion and professionalism in explaining the various dishes.It was a great dinning experience. Keep up the good work!特別な機会を祝うためにそこに行った。私たちは4つの料理とデザートを持つディナーコースでした。提供された食品の品質はトップグレードで、簡単に1-2ミシュランスターの品質でした。食べ物以外にも、サービスは一流のもので、特に様々な料理を説明するための情熱とプロフェッショナリズムを示したマネージャーのエヴェリンでした。素晴らしいダイニング体験でした。良い仕事を続けてください

Good cooking and excellent service. Love the fish skin and crab meat bun. Ambience was good and quiet
5
Good choice of food and drinks, nice ambience. Extremely attentive and professional service by the shift crew.
5
I think I love this place too much. I love the food and I love the way they serve it, I love the ambiance of this restaurant too. I will always come back here.
4
Overall a great experience and a beautiful restaurant to dine it.Some hits and misses for the dishes as some tasted very normal or was too fusion for our liking.Favourites include XO fried carrot cake, pan fried carrot cake, salted egg squid with almond, roast pork.
4
We had the steamed soon hock, soy sauce chicken, fried beef slices with ginger and spring onion and stirred fried spinach. My mum wasn't too impressed with the chicken, the rest of the dishes were fabulous although my mum would have liked the fish steamed with a little more oil. Overall we're very satisfied with the meal.

We were attracted by the HSBC Credit Card seafood dish 1 for 1 promotion. To our surprise, we were told by the serving staff that live seafood such as live fishes, are not eligible for the promotion. What was eligible was the frozen seafood such as scallops.This is the first time I have learn that live seafood is not seafood. How amazing is that
1
restaurant decor was 5-star. Service staff was inexperienced and recommended much more than we two diners could eat. Food was average for its price. Asked for carpark coupon and was greeted with glum reluctant waitress at reception counter
2
The staff were very friendly and gave good service but there was little atmosphere and the food was plentiful but disappointing . Really not to our taste and seemed quite pricey. We did enjoy the Jasmine tea though
3
Had a very well-executed CNY set menu for dinner. The special yusheng, roast suckling pig were excellent. Rest of dishes were delicious except for the noodles which were too saltish for most of the guests. Service was very good too for a Saturday evening. It would be a 5-star rating except for the exhorbitant price. Compared to other similar class Chinese restaurants, all my guests and I think the prices here are " not worth it", especially since It's not in prime location. Maybe at least 10% less would definitely attract more repeat customers
1
Went there for lunch today. Service extremely bad. Booked lunch at 1.15 pm but they only let us in after 1.25 pm and claimed that they had a group function. Dishes took long to serve and staff said that this is cuz they need to heat up... Gosh!!! Staff also quite rude in their service... Will never go again!!
4
Doing this in order to earn chop orders. Not too bad food, the deep fried stuff is always good. The dim sum buffet on weekends is much better value though!
4
We had the dim sum buffet. Very good spread of food, both fried and steam. We can also order a few side dishes. Like fried fish skin with salted egg. And each of us can order 1 serving of abalone as well.
5
Food is nice and staff are friendly. I must complement the chef for the nice food. Price is a bit on the high end, though.
5
Professional, prompt and warm service. Fresh and delicious food. Nice ambience. Overall Wonderful and enjoyable experience
5
My Husband and I dined several nights at the Man Fu Yuan restaurant. The food was awesome and very tasty, the staff were very accommodating with my food allergies. I highly recommend this restaurant.
5
Highly recommended, the dim sum selection was good along with other a la carte dishes! A nice place to have a relaxing quiet lunch with the family. Service was attentive
3
We did not want to venture far from the Intercontinental Hotel and wanted Chinese food, so we chose Man Fu Yuan, inside the hotel. Going on their website, I found the menu and expected high prices; but I also found some very affordable dishes. Unfortunately, after we were seated and saw the actual menu there were few listed. We did manage to get three good dishes that were less than SD30 (!) each but they were not worth the money. The wine selection was poor and the glass of red wine I was served tasted like it had been open for a day or more
4
Enjoyed the food. The roast pork belly was crispy. Their chicken feet was very soft and had a delicious flavour. We loved the mini egg tart as it was warm and fresh and melted in our mouth. Good place to hang out and chat w frens. Will be back.
5
I went here for a quick meal while staying at the hotel on business. The service was friendly and efficient. The menu allows for plenty of choice. I had two courses which was more than enough - I couldn't finish it all. Very tasty food in a clean and well laid out restaurant capable of taking lager groups
1
I know you want to make it classy, I know you want to impress the Caucasian but that doesn't work in me. My rice turns cold and hard while waiting for each dishes to be served! Chilli crabs meat without shell! What a joke..better don't serve it first at al
5
Overall, we were very happy with the service given during our dinner.
Staff were friendly, always smiling and very professional. It gives us the feeling of fine dining. Very personalize service.
5
I had dinner with my friends at Man Fu Yuan.We enjoyed the meal that was perfectly served by our servers,Maggie & Chris.The service was excellent and we'll definitely back!
5
1st time reservation but I do not know Dim Sam is only for lunch.
Dinner overroll is ok.
I rated Ecellent s because they prepared two cute bun （寿桃包）for my boy fren birthday … It's really special and sweet =] Thank you!
5
For a restaurant in a hotel the food is not too expensive. The food is great and flavourful. I love the decor of the restaurant as well.
5
We had our after ROM lunch there and Winnie Ong who was the captain there gave us excellent service from the time of reservation to the actual day of lunch. We actually went down even for site visit and our party of 6 tables cannot fit into the private room but Winnie was very helpful to help us allocate almost half of the restaurant to ourselves like a private corner event for us. We had 6 tables of guests and all my guests were happy with the food. They commented that the food kept coming and they were very yummy. At the end, all of my guest were left filling and satisfied which my husband and myself felt it was a good choice to have my ROM lunch there and we did not make a wrong decision to choose Man Fu Yuan restaurant. Also we felt that it is very reasonably priced for the service, quality of food and ambiance. Thank you Man Fu Yuan restaurant, also the chef that made the yummy food and especially to Winnie for the great service which made our ROM lunch a success
4
Very popular place for lunch. Must make reservation even on weekday.Both the steam and fried salted egg custard buns were good. The bean curd skin roll with shrimps were gigantic. The shrimps were so crunchy. We liked the claypot beef stew too, very reasonable price for a big pot
3
Service is good. Food is okay. It's over priced. I went for the Peking duck. If you like crispy skin this isn't the place for you. If you like lots of meat then then this is perfect (i love the meat more than the skin). It wasn't bad. I just wouldn't go out of your way to come here.
4
Food was great though expensive. However service is a little slow. One of the waitress must be in a bad mood of something, did not smile and gave very short answers. However, kudos to a young waiter who always on the ball in refilling our tea.
5
brought my grandparents along this time round and they were very pleased! had the dimsum as usual and the charsiewsou was still buttery and flaky. just the way I like it!! also got the calamari coated with salted egg yolk but the portion seems to have decreased a fair bit. nonetheless, enjoyable lunch and why not give it a shot if you haven't?
5
What a wonderful dining experience at Man Fu Yuan! My party of 4 had a great time feasting on the few signature dishes at the restaurant, accompanied by top service from the staff and the quiet and cosy ambience of the establishment. We ordered the Salted Egg Calamari, Wasabi Prawns, Combination Meat Platter, Roasted Duck, XO Seafood Fried Rice and Mango Sago Dessert, and all the dishes were well-cooked with fresh ingredients used, and portions big enough for all of us to share. Will definitely be back soon to try the other dishes
5
Had enjoy the high tea buffet with husband. Both of us enjoy the food n the atmosphere. Great food with great service!
5
Authentic cooking techniques with the freshest of ingredients. Luxurious dinning area and excellent service.
4
Had a business dinner at this restaurant conveniently located in the hotel. my partner did the ordering so it was a breeze and I think we must had the best dishes because everything was great, especially the fish. Recommended for large groups
5
We had the executive set lunch and loved the quality of the meal. The decor is simple and the ambience not too noisy for a chinese restaurant. Service was attentive too. The seating could be a bit more exclusive.
4
This restaurant is always on my top priority when visiting Singapore. This time I was there for a very light lunch. Still feeling full from my breakfast but couldn't resist to have this restaurant's dim sum. Well, it's nice n delicious. Service always good here.
5
Their lady restaurant manager treated us very well and she clearly has a lot of experience with what she is doing. She was very honest when recommending dishes where she cautioned us not to over order since the portion sizes are quite generous. We had a good education in how the dishes were prepared and it made eating there more interesting. The food is very very good and the portions are really larger than other Chinese restaurants of the same type and class. My friends and I had a very enjoyable time and we hope to have the chance to dine here again. Keep it up Man Fu Yuan
5
Came to celebrate my dad's 60th birthday. Food and service was excellent, nothing was lacking. We ordered:- Appetizer: Fried calamari w salted egg yolk & almond flakes (must order!)- Appetizer: Dong Po meat (tad too salty)- Appetizer: Jellyfish w Baby Octopus (nice, crunch and spicy)- Main: Chilli crabmeat with fried mantou buns (great for the lazy people who don't want to get their hands dirty!)- Main: Claypot chicken with abalone and salted fish (super yummy!)- Main: Crabmeat fried rice (very good)- Main: King Prawn with Scallop, asparagus & Black Truffle (very good as well!)Loved the dessert especially!- sweet potato balls with flowing custard lava)Overall, all the food we ordered was good and no complaints. Definitely will patronize more often in the coming months
3
Used to come very often in the past.... Food and service seems to drop in recent years... Like their private corner where you can dine in peace 
5
My second visit. ..always a delight. We got a table just before they closed. Ordered off the ala carte. I recall from last time the pork belly and rice were my favourites so I did not want to miss those we added prawns and duck in pancake. Everything terrific in taste. The prawns were very large and juicy and the duck was mickeyschiller@gmail.com wrapped for us. All smooth. . All I would say is they could do better with the wine menu. Staff were great and much better than my last visit. As a regular guest of the Intercontinental I will definately go again
5
I went to Man Fu Yuan for lunch last Saturday with my fussy entourage. We were warmly welcomed by the charming manager, Ms Evelyn Sim. As I'd been there a couple of times previously, I requested for something not in the menu to impress my guests. Ms Evelyn quickly directed my request to the head chef, Chef Kwan, who came personally to verify our food preferences/allergies. Viola! Chef Kwan served pan fried garoupa with foie gras and crab pincer in egg white. The 2 dishes were absolutely divine. Together with the dim sum combination suggested by Ms Evelyn, our lunch was more than satisfying. If you need to impress your guests, Man Fu Yuan will never fail you with Chef Kwan at the helm and attentive and friendly service from Ms Evelyn and her service crew
5
the menu is extensive so we had the peking duck (and put the meat into our rice), wasabi prawns (huge) and deep fried eggplant (not greasy). Washed down with a lovely peony tea - nice than green or jasmine.
4
The food here was very fresh & delicious, without using any MSG. However, it's not cheap do if u want a budget meal, go elsewhere. Everything I ate today was great, except the steamed fish, which was bit salty.
5
We had business lunch here. The food items were well prepared, excellent taste and good presentation. Staff are very polite and quick to response. We were impressed and highly recommend this restaurant. The only problem is they are always full and need advance booking.
4
When there to celebrate my daughter birthday. Ala carte prices a little bit high, but if you appreciate the fresh ingredients use than enjoyed the meal. Tim sum is nice range can improve and be more creative to attract more guest.
5
A wonderful lunch experience. Brilliant service and you get a great experience of asian food. A very worthwhile experience.
4
Was dissapointed on entry as there was no staff to show us our seat despite a reservation...and there seemed to preoccupied with other guests. Things soon improved though. Food was excellent. We ate off the ala carte and the portions were sufficient suckling pork, scallops and beef were all mouth watering. In the end it went really well. Good flow and the service dramatically improved......will eat there again on my next trip
5
Man Fu Yuan is one of the most traditional Chinese restaurant and at the same time with the splendor of a modern day fine dine style cooking and presentation. I tried teh restaurants twice during teh last week of November and teh food was excellent as usual
4
Man full man serve high quality food. Their pork belly was super, smoke duck very nice, live prawn very fresh, deep fried salt fish skin very good not salty. Mee sua with crab meat impressive. Overall ingredients are very fresh, maybe a little pricey compare to other restaurants but is worth it. For 4 pax we spent about $300.00 my brother,sister in law was very impressed with the foods
5
Located in the Intercontinental hotels corridor on the second floor ,elegant doors open to a smiling greeter,pleasant decor and an illustrious menu suited for the fine diner,the offerings are to numerous to mention and I was guided by the maitre'd.and had a wonderful experience,I would welcome a return visit
4
Visited this restaurant for the first time in a recent trip to Singapore. Tried it mostly for convenience as I was staying at the intercontinental but the reputation of the place was very good.I wasn't disappointed. Service was efficient and available without being too in my face.Food was great - perch cubes and lime followed by prawns in special soy. Washed down with ice cold tsing Tao - very good meal
3
The food is excellent. Well presented. Service is pretty good, although slow sometimes. Music is very Chinese but some of which are not suitable for dining - little sad.
5
Awesome service, great staff and managers. Made us feel like we are family/friend. Love the food, well worth the price.
3
Located in a lovely heritage hotel with Peranakan touches, this Chinese restaurant serves average food, decent enough for a hotel guests.
5
~Dim Sum prepared to order, every detail and taste double blind... this is the place for an expensive but great Cantonese lunch
~Only thing is the longer than normal wait and in Jun that incessant construction din going on outside!
3
Food was okay, service nothing spectacular. Not the easiest place to find. I will not be going back, as there are better (and less expensive) options.
3
We were staying at the Intercontinental Hotel and decided to try the food in this restaurant. The service is good and so is the food but nothing special. You could eat better quality food elsewhere for a lot less. I heard the dim sum's for lunch are very good
5
I was invited to join in for lunch by my colleagues as she had a cash voucher issued by Amex. To our surprise, the dinsum is superb in Man Fu Yuan. I can not pick on any item to criticize. We order the trio roast consist of roast duck, char siew & soya chicken. The skin of the roast duck is crispy, char siew tasty, the soya chicken below average, nothing to shout about.The service was fantastic, the servers keep changing our plates, refilling our teas were prompt and efficient without asking to. By the way, the tea per pax is at $8 per pax, we find it on a high side. The price food for din sum maybe slightly more expensive than crystal jade, imperial but it comes with good quality, freshness of ingredients, the size of dim sum is good. Roughly about $5-6.80, some items at $8.80.The bill came up to about $160 for 4 pax inclusive of tax & services. Very worth checking out. I rate this one of the best dim sum so far, compared to the hua ting, east ocean, jia wei, crystal jade, imperial, red star, old hong kongMust check out this place and you will never regret.
4
We enjoyed our dinner in this restaurant during our stay at the hotel with the staff being very pleasant and extremely efficient. In fact probably too efficient, in that if I had a criticism at all it would be that in true Asian dining style the courses in our set menu arrived in very quick concession. This makes it very difficult to linger over an enjoyable dinner,with the whole event being over within not much more than an hour. So my suggestion would be, that the waiter could possibly ask what timing the diners would like between courses.  I'm a vegetarian and I must say the restaurant was very accommodating in organising a superb set menu to suit me
4
This restaurant is located on the first floor of The Intercontinental Hotel. Due to poor signage as you leave the lift, it is very difficult to find the restaurant, but after having walked past all the ballrooms, we headed back and finally found it.Nice dÃ©cor, clean and crisp tablecloths - it was conservative yet chic.Even though it was already just after 2pm, we were not very hungry so we ordered light - just some har gau and mango prawn rolls to start, but we felt like ordering fish. We sought advice from our senior staff person. She recommended steamed Soon Hook - a white fish that we were not familiar with. Great choice - soft, pulled away from the bones effortlessly, light soy sauce. No alcohol today, just jasmine tea and a complimentary home made plum wine at the end of the meal rounded off a very nice afternoon
4
Located in the Intercontinental Hotel, level 2. Just near Bugis junction. location is good. had been there for business dinner. We were group of 7 people. Seating arrangement is good, with enough space between tables. Portions are reasonably sized. Make a point not to over order. Service was fast and good. Being guests, cannot comment on the pricing
3
Had a lunch which was turned out to be very average and nothing outstanding. The quality of food was OK.
5
I had my lunch and dinner at this restaurant simply because the food was delicious. I had dimsum on a Sunday lunch and nice ala carte for dinner. The service was good and friendly. The price also reasonable. I love this restaurant.
5
Luncheon Tim Sum was a delight, a fantastic variety of cusine with seafood mix and other Asian delcacies..The sweets were extrodinary with sweet potato balls with custard inside..also the best egg tarts you could taste.
4
Given this restaurant's status as one of the top Asian eateries in Singapore we found the menu to be very good value. Wine prices, of course, are exorbitant but that's Singapore all over. Food items were both innovative and traditional and service was very attentive.
5
when staying at the Intercon, we Always eat here ...... love the food there !!! Pork Sweet n Sour, Vegetable dishes, Seafoods, accompanied by a nice bottle of Malbec ........
5
Enormously tasty traditional Singaporean food. Beautifully prepared. Lovely setting, and excellent service. Also an excellent place for an event for about 20 people.
4
We dined here recently as we were staying in the Intercontinental and this is onsite.This restaurant is not large, feels quite intimate, and well spaced.The food was very good, matched by very good service, though a little aloof sometimes.Wine list was OK if a little expensive (like all Singapore).Overall a good experience.Recommende

I was invited to dinner on 08 March 2015 at Man Fu Yuan restaurant which is located on 1st floor of Hotel Intercontinental, Bugis in Singapore. This was a gathering of school mates and acquaintances who had known each other for more than 48 years. Total age of 10 of us would have exceeded 600 years. The host of this dinner was a friend who had done quite well in his career. He order the S$888 menu with 8 courses to give us a treat.Hotel is on furtherest side of Bugis Village from the Bugis mrt station. It was my 2nd time to this restaurant so I was sure of my way. If you are coming by mrt, alight Bugis station, exit and walk through the shopping area toward Hotel Intercontinental/Middle Road. There are signs directing you to the hotel. Enter to lobby and walk to elevators/stairs on right side of reception counters (center of lobby) to go up to 1st floor. When you enter Man Fu Yuan, you will find that decoration of this restaurant is simple yet look elegant and is suitable for a 5 star restaurant. It serves dim sum, Cantonese cuisine and other Chinese dishes in the menu. The fixed menus (5 – 8 courses) with prices ranging from SGD 488 – SGD 888 come with appetizer (jellyfish, pork, duck), bird nest soup, scallops, bbq pork fish, stir-fry broccoli, seafood fried noodles and desserts. There are ala carte menu and assortment of dim sum too. Then there is the liquor/wine menu. Beer of all brands come in small glass bottle type only. You cannot order jug of beer to share because it is not available here. First course was a bowl of bird nest soup each, followed by roasted duck, prawns salad, fried yam & prawn ball, stewed goose feet with mushroom & veg, glass of prune juice with fried noodle and cold dessert with 2 scoop of ice cream. Most of us drank Chinese tea only which went down well with the food. Services by staff was good and were attentive to clear used plates and top up tea cups. Also they helped to served the food into smaller individual plate/bowl for each of us. Eveyone agreed that the food was well cooked and tasted great. Even the fried noodle tasted good and I finished it. After all the rich food, we were served with a small glass of cold prune juice before dessert. I believe this help to dilute/wash away the oil in the stomach. There was some uneaten food that we could not finished which the staff helped to pack for one of the guests
3
It was our first night in Singapore and we were a little tired and a little hungry and Man Fu Yuan was close. The food was good, but nothing exceptional and the service a little “off”. I think the place lacks a certain charm that I have experienced at other Asian restaurants
5
We were staying at the Intercontinental and decided on a whim to try Man FU Yuan. What a delightful surprise. This is one of the best Chinese restaurants I've eaten in for a very long time. The quality and selection of food, including the Lunar New Year specials, was fantastic. Our selection included the suckling pig combination. This included duck, suckling pig and chicken. Absolutely melt in your mouth, beautiful food.The lobster in XO sauce was very good too!All in all, a great restaurant with a good wine list. Excellent service also added to our overall experience. This isn't your cheap and cheerful restaurant. You pay for what you get but what you get, in our opinion is worth every cent
3
Reasonable Chinese food, but top flight prices. Otherwise, correct service in the first floor of the Intercontinental Hotel.
5
My family and I had dinner last stay in Singapore, and was excited to see a suckling pig as the signature dish. It was presented beautifully, and the whole experience was superb. Great selection of cantonese dishes and great surroundings.
Highly recommended!
5
Very well executed food beautifully presented by attentive and knowledgeable staff. Not the cheapest but well worth it. A great experience.
5
Really impressive but simple and authentic. The service is delightful and the food is absolutely delicious and not too expensive. Very good!
4
Except for some odd moments with the service, it is worth making a trip to Man Fu Yuan for their food. I was quite satisfied with their Dim Sums and soup.
4
Appetizer (jellyfish, pork, duck), soup, scallops and broccoli stir-fry, seafood fried noodles, desserts, dim sum in the Intercontinental Hotel residents in something fair to it has been service. Taste like there was a pretty or because there was also dim sum in the split and easily order volume. Course lunch there a la carte, also dim sum. Although I was made because I wanted to drink fresh melon juice it was felt to say (which I think from the restaurant below) Oh and failure. If only the tea was good. Many dinner of local people, pretty, it was crowded. Service was good and the feeling that without leaving not stick. But this! Since there is no decisive factor to say is ... be no carry bother foot
4
Another 5-star Canton cuisine restaurant in town IMO. Food here is comparable to any top restaurants you can think of in Singapore but what I like about this place is their emphasis on tea to go with your food. I also like the ambiance here i.e. bright and simple, giving diners a cozy feel. Service staffs are also very friendly and attentive here
4
Ate here one evening while staying at the Intercontinental. I chose a fixed menu (5 courses) as I am not particularly familiar with many of the dishes and wasn't sure what would go with what. The food was all delicious and very well presented. The only let down was the fact that it was a very quiet evening which gave the place a cold air. we were probably just unlucky on that as it deserves to be more popular
4
We decided to head over to Man Fu Yuan in the Intercontinental for a spot of lunch and discovered a new Cantonese gem. The service was fine but it was the food that really made the visit. The Dim Sum was excellent and has certainly turned Man Fu Yuan into a new favourite for my lunch break
4
Went with a few friends to try out their 19th anniversary promotion where 19 signature dishes are priced at $19 each. Overall the dishes are good but some could be better; they tasted just mediocre for such a good restaurant. Anyway worth the visit, will visit again
4
Nice ambiance! Dim Sum is good but quite expensive. Love the Honey Walnut side dish. Overall had an enjoyable lunch with family.
5
This was a late father's day luncheon with the extended family. Although we did not go for the extensive menu, we choose to have dim sum. I must say I was extremely satisfied with the choices that my wife ordered. The salted egg squid was awesome and as always being a sucker for char siew pau, it did not disappoint!! The pau deserved a 5 star rating! Piping hot and the meat melts in the mouth!The atmosphere of the restaurant was very well done up and had a very high class feel. It was one of the most comfortable seats that I have sat on in a restaurant.The only drawback was that being in Singapore, i guess the staff were more of trainees and part-timers which dampened the service quality as they had to check with their seniors on basic orders like a glass Ginger Ale.but nevertheless, it was truly money well spent and I will come back again for my Dim Sum Fix
5
There appears to be a wave of nouvelle cuising moving through the Chinese restaurant, making things lighter, fresher and very interesting in combinations of flavours that result. Man Fu Yuan in the Intercontinental Singapore provides an example with its lunch menus. Take the soup - a well prepared pumpkin soup with a difference: the addition of fresh ginger results in an almost citric flavour. Then in the middle: a peeled, steamed tomato with, surprise, a delicious stuffing of chinese mushrooms. A delight for all senses. Add on to this the great service at the Man Fu Yuan (including the sharing of some of the dishes secrets!) and a wonderful setting within the classy Intercontinental - and you have the perfect lunch.Lunch for three with a glass of wine as apéro and tea throughout the meal set us back S$27
4
Serving up authentic Cantonese dishes with an emphasis on old, classic dishes, the new Taste of Nostalgia menu is pretty impressive. Classics like Tea-Smoked Pork Belly Char Siew and Steamed Fish Head in Black Bean Sauce will definitely appeal to those who like traditional Chinese dishes.The dim sums are also well-known to be freshly handmade, and will definitely be a delight to share amongst friends
4
I should have write that review a few hours after our lunch because 2 weeks later I don't remember the specifics with one exception; we had a very nice cold soup based on passion-fruit that was quite a treat!All in all we had a good lunch with a few courses (dim sum, fish soup, rice with dried sausages) that were quickly served.It is a nice place to have lunch and next time I'll explore the menu in more depth

For more reviews, visit my blog at ms-skinnyfatMan Fu Yuan is one of Singapore’s finest Chinese restaurants, serving classic Cantonese cuisine created especially for the restaurant by a Hong Kong Master Chef. From now till 31 May 2014, Man Fu Yuan is serving some glorious dishes from the good old days, made using good quality ingredients and special and laborious techniques. Now here are some favorites from the Nostalgic Menu. The flavourful Mixed Beef Stew with handmade beef balls 牛什牛丸煲 ($28 per portion). I love how the meat is tender and savory. The beef balls were succulent and had nice chunks of water chestnut in them. This is the perfect comfort food.Tea-smoked Pork Belly Char Siew 脆皮叉烧 ($24 per portion) takes centre stage, featuring pork belly marinated in a combination of Chinese rose wine and barbecue sauce. It's fatty and decadent but hey YOLO. I loved the Hong Kong Style Steamed Pork Belly in Shrimp Paste 港式咸虾酱蒸花肉 ($28 per portion). This is another comfort dish and i can fully identify with the flavors though i've never had this dish before. Salty, stinky and oh damn delicious. Give me another 2 bowls of rice.Pig Trotters with Vinegar 猪脚醋 ($28 per portion). The meat was well braised in plum vinegar and you can smell the sour perfume from far. The dish is on the oily side though. Ended dinner with some Hashima. It typically comes served in a coconut but Chef wasn't too pleased with the coconut that day.If you find these flavors familiar and are craving for it now, Man Fu Yuan's A Taste of Nostalgia Menu will be available as part of a rotating a la carte menu available daily till 31 May 2014. Do call the restaurant to find out if they'll be serving your favorite dish before heading down

Man Fu Yuan was like an oasis of peace and calm when we walked in from the hustle and bustle that was Bugis Street.The decor of the restaurant was understated and exuded a sense of quiet dignity.The Dim Sum were excellent. One can see the skill and care taken by the chef in preparing them - Delicately wrapped dumplings that contained fresh and delicious ingredients .Service staff were attentive and at the same time suitably discrete; Always there when we need them and at a polite distance when we were deep in conversation.Competitively priced when compared with restaurants in the same price, Man Fu Yuan is a great choice when you need your Dim Sum fix
3
We chose this place for lunch as it was close to our meeting location. They had a lunch set so we took that. First course was an uninspired quartet of dim sum. Nothing fancy, average taste. Next was a soup and it was a pedestrain pork broth. Then was the perch which i thought was the best and only passable dish of thr day. Fourthly the carbs dish. It was awful. An unappetising rice dish with shrivelled chinese sausages and equally shrivelled vegetables. What a disgrace. Lastly was a very mundane mango sago pudding with 2 tiny balls of ice cream. This place is ranked in the top 100 due to food bloggers who get free mooncakes etc. so avoid if you ca

For full reviews and pictures, visit my blog at ms-skinnyfat.comIf you can convince a non-mooncake lover to eat mooncakes and recommend them willingly, it must mean that your mooncakes are pretty awesome right? The nice folks at Man Fu Yuan, InterContinental Singapore, were kind to send their latest sweets my way and the obligatory bite(s) ended up doing some serious damage to my abs and cheeks. And i'm not even the mooncake monster S is.Man Fu Yuan has unveiled a divine collection of handcrafted mooncakes in a specially designed box created in collaboration with the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts, featuring a winning calligraphic design inspired by ancient legends of the Mid-Autumn Festival.What i like are the snowskin mooncakes, which were easy on the vanilla essence taste in the skin (thank god). The Snowskin Mooncake Combination ($54.80 for 4pcs) includes Green tea Paste with Dragonball Jasmine, Pulot Hitam, White Lotus Seed Paste with Macadamia Nuts and Sesame Paste with White Sesame Seeds.My favorite of the lot? The Green Tea Paste with Dragonball Jasmine which is so aromatic. You can taste every bit of the intense green tea flavor and be refreshed by the lingering jasmine perfume. What's best is that it isn't too sweet.The Black and White Sesame was my other favorite. This is a savory sweet mooncake and certainly the first one of its kind that i've tried. Just make sure you don't eat this on your first date. It has that malt candy filling taste actually, very similar to that of the Chinese pastries (pong pia).The new creation which is the 'Pulot Hitam' mooncake, a Peranakan dessert made from black glutinous rice, didn't fare too well with me. I found the filling too hard; it was impossible to cut through it even after defrosting it for a bit and the skin melted beyond recognition as i was trying to get a slice out. It also lacked the richness of the actual dessert. Such a pity.Durian fans rejoice. There's also the Snowskin "Mao Shan Wang" Durian Mooncake with Coconut ($54.80), which is a decadent blend of premium durian pulp and fragrant coconut milk

We chose from the dim sum menu and the $18 per portion menu. Roast pork: very crispy skin, with sufficient lean meat so as not to eat only lard. One of the best I’ve ever tasted. Dim sum: fresh ingredients, thin skin (where relevant). Worth every cent. The chicken feet had minced dried prawns, which is unusual in a nice way. The char-siew sow has a layer of cheese, also unique and flavorful.Steam fish on tofu, topped with minced ginger: No fishy smell, also very delicious. Ginger slightly over powering (if you are not the type to swallow ginger). Chinese tea: S$6 per person. Rather steep if you are not into Chinese tea.Service: Food came at the right speed – we were there on a Saturday, between 12 – 1 pm. The waiters do not congregate to chit chat or say private things to each other. They are attentive and prompt. They have good attitude.Décor: generally white tone, quiet and not ostentatious - I like. Not the usual red, dragon, big lanterns type of interior design found in Chinese restaurants

Delicious Dim Sum here - beautiful restaurant and superb food and service. Went for a work lunch and was suitably stuffed after.

I came for lunch and chose from the Dim Sum menu, which was more extensive then I expected. It has a nice variety of 'chef recommendations' to some all time favourites. The restaurant itself, is stylish, not large, with generous size tables & space between tables (which keeps it all rather private). Overall an elegant decor which fits to the whole Intercontinental Singapore look and feel, with nice bone china on our table and starched tablecloths. On arrival the table had some nibbles of sweat roasted baby octopus and a winter-melon salad, tasteful. The Dim Sum were delicious, elegant and delicate. The pastries, buns or 'noodle' dough were very fine, with generous fillings bursting with flavours. Ideal size too, one that fills but not so big they fall all over the plate. As a finish we were given shots of plum juice, which cooled and left us with a nice feeling of satisfaction of a great meal. I need to come back to try some of the ones my partner and I didn't get too

This is the second time I have eaten here on a weekend. This time I was with my partner who loves Pork Buns. I dont eat pork so cannot comment.We both love the dim sum and dumpings of yum cha - and this is a speciality here.We had emailed in advance for an reservation, and this did not seem to be recorded- however they had a table for us. We had arrived just before midday - just after they opened, and we had a 4pm flight.Impeccable service, including assisting in our choice of dishes, the mandarin sago pudding - I would not have chosen from the menu - but when it was described to me I thought it would be great, we both ordered it - and loved it.Awesome delicious food -washed down with great fresh Jasmine tea, the do have a great range of Asian teas, and some delicious New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc.My partner who had been particularly grumpy the day before as we coped with an very long flight delay, stated that yesterday was all worth it - just for that port bun - high praise indee

There are alot of good Chinese restaurants in japan and I often eat Chinese cuisine when I travel. This is the best I have tried in singapore! Service was commendable, I ordered beer and tea. My tea was always full and I was very surprised when the waiter was extreamly friendly when I took a long time to decide on my beer. The food is absolutely delicious, dinner was, without a doubt, one of the best. Course after course, all dishes were executed with precision and the right amount of "fire" as required in Chinese cooking. I will definitely come again when I revisit singapore in 1 months time. And it's extra specoal because it's in my new favourite hotel. The intercontinental in singapore.

We became addicted to Cantonese food at the Lei Garden chain of restaurants in Singapore (and later, Hong kong), and we decided it was time to try lunch at other Cantonese restaurants, especially since the Orchard Road Lei Garden stopped providing crispy chicken (unless you order a day ahead).Man Fu Yuan, on the second floor of the Intercontinental Hotel, affords a surprisingly plain inside that highlights the shop-house architecture of the Intercontinental. They had a good variety of freshly-squeezed juices, and we liked the apple juice. We can recommend each dish that we ordered because each was well prepared and deliciousFried pork bellyHalf crispy chickenHong Kong kailan (sweet and tender)Mango pudding The white rice was tasty and well done, but it was thinner grain than we expectedThe bill was a bit expensive but we appreciated the really good food and service. We know we will start missing the taste of the offerings, especially the mango pudding, so we will return

I am a regular at Man Fu Yuan. I have been visiting the restaurant for many years now though I did not visit it during a spell when the prices went ridiculously sky-high.Fortunately, customers can put that unfortunate episode behind.The restaturant is currently serving its $17 a dish promotion. Do take advantage of this while it last until the first week of September 2012.Even after the promotion, do visit the restaurant where the service staff are happy serving you and they even throw in a complimentary san-char tea served chilled once you ask for the bill. I thought the cold sour tea helps in digestion (and weight losing after a heavy meal!) Good move, Man Fu Yuan!Back to the food. I like the braised pork served with man-tou. It is sweet and well-braised even those who have lost their teeth will have no problem chewing the succulent pork. I guess the secret to their success in more dish than one lies in the good sweet dark sauce used.And this brings me to the steame slice fish serve atop toufu. The sweetness of the sauce add a new dimension to the steamed fish (grouper served if ordered sans promotion while sea perch is served at promotional prices). Sea perch gives a slightly more buttery taste while the grouper slices appear more 'solid' - the flesh is fresh. I like both equally much.The restaurant used to served their drunken chicken warm - which is unique as they were the only ones serving it warm. Now it is served chilled. I like it provided there is not too much Chinese wine used.I also liked its shelled chillie crab (with man tou). The idea of eating crab without dirtying your fingers or having to remove the flesh yourself from the sometimes stubborn shells is a motivation for me to order this dish. Some may argue that you need to cook the crab with the shells in order to extract the aroma of the crab in the sauce. Try this and see if you would change your mind afterwards.The suckling pig is anoher highlight in this restaurant but the prices is easily twice that of street prices. The upmarket restaurant and its strategic location in the Intercon Hotel kind of jutify the price. Plus the skin is well-barbecued to perfection. Yummy to go with the sauce. Such indulgence once in a while should not be too much of a problem. Visit Ma Fu Yuan. Good food with a local twist and without having to fly to Hong Kong

We had tried to get in here on a previous visit to Singapore but were unsuccesful. Even though we were staying at the Intercontinental Hotel, getting in was not easy as the restaurant is very popular with the locals. We were the only westerners there on the day we went but the wait was well worth it.My Peking Duck was exactly what you would expect but the skin was served at the table with each piece wrapped in "pastry" with fresh vegetables and a tangy sauce. Exotic.The pork my wife had was to die for.Not a cheap meal but a great experience

busy restaurant in the intercontinental hotel. some of the 'delicacies' can be very expensive (abolone) but overall good value for singapore and great cantonese cuisine.we can really recommend the suckling pig. Crispy, great flavour, served 2 ways, crackling in pancakes similar to crispy duck, meat with sauce and if you choose- rice or noodles. loved it.a real experience. we were only westerns in restaurant. the rest were local families, so must be doing something right

Excellent food of high qaulity. highlight for me being the barbeque pork ribs (without the bone). Wine list could be more extensive (compared with selections we get in NZ and Australia. It was so good we went back their twce in the week were staying at the intercontinental

Some colleagues and I tried Man Fu Yuan shortly after it's reopening earlier this year and again last month. the Dim Sum were simply amazing. the service is also excellent. i also tried the pork and the lobster, both were great. overall it's a great place, especially for a business lunch that has a more local flair
