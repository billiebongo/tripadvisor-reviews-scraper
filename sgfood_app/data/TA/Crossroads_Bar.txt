Barista -Bartender Bianca will make you feel welcome at any time during your visit. The Crossroads Bar in the hotel's foyer is a great place to rest or meet.

Crossroads bar has been refu4bished & is much better. Nice area with good seating. Much better lighting and staff are friendly and the cocktails were fantastic, says my wife..Great to relax in

The service was a bit slow but the waitress apologised for it and provide some additional food to compensate the delay. The food and drinks was good. The place was very relaxing.

For the long term guests of Swissotel Merchant Court, you'll know that the bar has been renovated and is a blast from the past. Excellent service by the staff (who are Korean I believe), you can choose from a wide selection of drinks and cocktail - all in comfort and peace, that is not bustling with madness like the other bars along Clarke Quay

The buffet dinner has a lot of choices, the squeezers with prawns were delicious. All types of food available. As said in my review of the hotel, the outside seating on the terrace could be upgraded a bit : decoration, lighting, a fresh paint on the walls,... please make more attractive, you might also gain more walk in customers from outside the hote

Had afternoon tea here. Food was okay, nothing extraordinary. Staff was polite and attentive. Atmosphere was average - it was a very open sort of place, we felt like we were sitting in the lounge of a lobby for all to see. Overall it was a good place to relax and catch-up with my girlfriends but not a place I would choose to return because of the atmosphere and average food

Had the straits tea menu during our high tea and the food served was really not very good. Very average and not very exciting nor tasty especially considering the cost. The food did not look very fresh either. Order an extra english scones set and the clotted cream was pretty watery and the scones not warm and kind of dry and hard. Atmosphere wise the restaurant was actually kind of hot the whole time (even though it was raining outside!) and tables set up was a little awkward (low coffee table and not much space on it for the high tea set & 3 pots of tea). Overall was not a good experience and would not go back.

Happen to be waiting for friends so we decided to have a drink at the Crossroads Bar, ordered a classic mojito and it was amazing! I think a Korean lady, Olivia was the one who served us and she was very friendly and tentative. The manager lady had a chat with us and suggested us places to eat and where to go about. Very helpful! Went into this bar and it made our day AWESOME

I had some time to take a break and get a drink by myself at the Crossroads Bar at the Swissotel lobby at Merchant Court. I was greeted by the friendliest and ost professional bartender Olivia Kim. I askes her for a suggestion as to snacks and she recommended the chicken karrage. For cocktails ahe recommendwd the mojito. I have to say the mojito was a perfect mix of citrus flavours and alcohol. Excellent. And the chicken karrage was amazing. It had some green herbs on it which gave it a very clean taste with the yuza sauce. But most importantly Olivia Kim and Chloe provides excellent service! Must come again
