The restaurant is opened by Koreans and you can see many koreans living in that area visiting the restaurant. The army stew is a must have! and their sidedishes are great as well. A must go place for korean food lovers

Went for the 1st time. Very nice food and authentic korean food. Had their army stew. The food was hot and nice. Also had the yum yum chicken. Had a wonderful lunch!

The pork BBQ set was good. The fried chicken was disappointing. The kimchi is the best! Free refill of the side dishes. And very very nice shochu (Korean spirit)!

Highly recommended. Very yummy food . Good if have more people can share more food as some food only comes in big portion and one size only.

Good for family gathering, weekend very busy so reservation is a must. Authentic atmosphere, serve by Koreans and K-pop MTV for entertainment

Food was good. Love the wide spread of side dishes. I love the Kim chi, while my husband and cousin love the other side dishes. Ordered cheese ramen. Big portion. Tasty. Fried chicken and soy sweet chicken were succulent. Lady boss who served us gave my 3 kids free drinks and greeted us Happy New Year with a wide smile. Will be back for more

We tried booking via internet but were told they are full. When we called, somehow there was a table. The restaurant is understaffed and almost impossible to get service. When we ordered beer, it took a long time as the staff needed taking another tableâ€™s order. When the beer finally arrived, they placed bottle opener for you to open by yourself but took it away after. So when we ordered subsequent bottle, we had to ask again. It was very warm and we were perspiring away. Staff was kind to help us to cook but either the meats were bland or tough. Overall a disappointing experience.

Overall the service was bad. Both staff and boss/manager couldn't recommend any dish when we asked for recommendation. Ordered a can of coke zero and throughout the meal of 40 minutes, it wasn't serve until we have to remind them twice. Pancake was so so & mackerel was too hard and dry. Army stew and garlic chicken were nice

Conveniently located just a short walk from Beauty World MRT, I was pleasantly surprised by this restaurant. It has a Korean feel, from the black stoneware for the soup to the water bottles and even the K Pop videos projected on the wall. The bean paste stew and kimchi jeon (pancake) were rather tasty. And, the side dishes were refillable...just like in South Korea

We had dinner there on a Saturday night. We didn't have reservations, but only had to wait for five minutes to get seated. Although it is usually pretty crowded on weekends from what I have seen in the past. Service was nice, albeit a bit swamped you get the impression. Side dishes and water are free of charge which is a nice touch. We had the seafood pancake, the hot pot beef and the bibimbab. The seafood pancake was a bit on the smallish side and definitely not enough as a main. The hot pot beef----bit tasteless, had much better before. The bibimbab was quite tasty though. Overall, food was ok but nothing to rave about. Wouldn't necessarily come back
