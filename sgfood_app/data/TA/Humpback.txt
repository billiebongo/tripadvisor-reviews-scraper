Happy hour oysters between 5pm - 8pm everyday - all day/night on Mondays. Sharing plates. Great service and nice outside atmosphere on a cute little street.
5
Go for the happy hour!! 5-8 pm and all night Monday. Oysters and cocktails are excellent. You'll probably wanna stick around for dinner too.
3
It's not spectacular but food, service and atmosphere are all very good. I would say it's a little pricey but only a little.
5
The oysters were fresh, juicy and sweet. Service crews were really helpful and friendly as well. Highly recommend this place.
3
I was there for the 1st time and i kinda like the relaxed mood setting.. the standard of the wine served and quality of oysters were ok but i think the overall pricing was a bit steep..
5
My favorite place for oysters and always great new surprising fusion dishes on the menu.
Furthermore the service is always nice, fast and personal.
If you like oysters, best get there at happy hour :)
Will be back for more!

We had a bit of a craving for oysters last week and knowing that the Happy Hour ends at 8pm here we were able to just scrape in to get our fix. 4 different types of oysters available during the Happy Hour at $3++ each or $2++. A small selection of drinks also available during Happy Hour. I had an Old Fashioned for $14++. The oysters were really quite good, but even during the HH it's not a cheap night here
5
We went here because of the favorable reviews we found on the net. Arriving quite early for dinner we got a place to sit outside (it is probably a good idea to make a reservation for dinner). The friendly staff served us a great variety of tasty oysters and seafood. Of note: The vinaigrette with the oysters was superb and the manila clams are just wicked! The choice of wines is also very satisfying. All in all a great experience. Will return when in Singapore

Situated nearby the iconic Chinatown, Humpback serves tasty modern cuisine coupled with a good draft of fruity wheat beer and well curated music. For food lovers, you will enjoy the Oysters and the well thought out creative food menus. If you love your drinks, try their beers and wine and proceed to their affiliate The Flagship bar just beside for their well stocked whiskies. For music lovers... you can expect well curated rock music in the background. Prepare to pay though for this enjoyable experience 
3
Before visiting Humpback, I've rather high expectations because of many recommendations by online websites. The atmosphere, service and the ease of transportation is good, no fuss. However, I don't quite enjoy the quality of my oysters. I wished they taste better and fresher. And $16 for 3 razor clams is rather steep, with the price, my friend and I were expecting the quality and taste of the seafood to be above average.
4
We ordered the Torched Salmon, Octopus, Squid, Oyesters, Burrata and Uni. The Uni was the least exciting or tasty.
5
This place is one of my favs in Singapore, it never fails to disappoint. The oyster & drinks happy hour until 8pm is incredible value for money. The rest of the menu is delish too.
5
Brought our 3 year old princess along for our wedding Anniversary brunch. Humpback was nice to provide a complimentary cake for our celebration... Food was good. Oyster was fantastic. Service staff was pleasant.
5
There is a lot of imagination going into the food which took us by pleasant surprise. We had an elderly in wheelchair so the staff was very accomodating and seated us outside . They were attentive to our needs and made a very good impression.
4
Non-oysters eater eating oysters. Everything from the food to the setup to the lady boss was top-notch!
5
Went for happy hour oyster day on Monday.. love their oysters @2-3 pc.. regrettably the sides were rather small in portion for that price.. service was good..
4
Great food and service but on the pricey side. One of the best sharing menus in town and a great spot for drinks and dinner with lots of small plate options to satisfy all sorts of tastes. Oysters are some of the best in town and a fantastic wine list and well versed sommelier.
4
Meant to try Gibson’s but my friend sat at Humpback (a sister establishment) mistakenly. The oysters weren’t much to shout about (sorry no pictures)..but their happy hour elderflower spritzer and seafood sausage (very interesting with good chucks of crunch prawn!) and mushroom & burrata were delicious
5
Happy hour deal for oysters and cocktails is great! Check their website for the updated timing as it may have changed. It can be really busy so booking a table is a must. Oysters are fresh and delicious - mostly from the Pacific Northwest - Washington / Canada, but also some from the NZ North Island can be availableTimes for November 2017:Mon-Fri: 5pm–12am(last orders 11.30pm)Sat: 5pm-11pm(last orders 10:30pm)Sunday brunch: 11am-3pm(last orders 2.30pm)Mon & Sun Happy Hour oysters all day!Mon-Sat Happy Hour @ 5pm-8p
5
Humpback does a limited chef's table offering every couple of months, for only four diners a night. We had a superb seafood-oriented seven course affair, paired with three cocktails designed specifically for the menu. These were really very well done and enhanced the flavour of the dishes quite remarkably.The atmosphere was buzzing and we had a bird's eye view of the kitchen being sat right outside it, and were looked after well by the staff throughout the evening
5
Excellent food on offer offering lots of great different tastes - we bought 4-5 plates and shared between 4 of us which was great.
5
Loved the drinks and happy hour. All the small plates we had were good, esp. memorable were the kale salad and churros with salted caramel creme at the end!
5
Been there quite a couple of times. Food is always good. Try their lobster roll and oysters. Make sure to save some space for churros!
5
We had a great dinner experience with Humpback. They serve delicious oyster with affordable price. Make sure you make a reservation to secure a seat with them!
4
Enjoyed sunday brunch with offer of happy hour oyster
Spanish pork rib is surprisingly super nice.
Restaurant layout is stylish though the seats are not really very comfortable. Table and table is very close, no privacy. Staff are very nice.
4
This is the perfect go to restaurant for dinner with friends! Staff are really friendly & happy with the service. We had a selection of the oysters which were delicious & amazing value at $3 each! Between us we then shared calamari, tuna, Brussels sprouts & kale, all of which were really tasty and perfect sharing size. Prosecco at happy hour $60 for a bottle.
4
We wanted to talk over some stuff over a light dinner and chanced upon this place. The staff was very friendly and offered recommendations on what we could order as my friend prefers non meat dishes. We had the king prawns, kale salad and cheese balls. Sat outside where there are hooks under the table to hang our bags. We also had Chianti and the gin and tonic. The serving of the food was tapas size but with the rich flavors it was just nice for us to also fill in a flourless chocolate cake for dessert. There is also happy hour for oysters. Will revisit
4
As a regular at Sugarhall, we wanted to do dinner proper at the F&B group's other restaurant, Humpback. It was definitely an enjoyable night at Humpback, with its simple menu of unpretentious food, friendly service team and comfortable, understated interior. Polo, the hardworking man, busy shucking oysters behind the counter, shared with me that the restaurant does a seafood forward omakase menu every 2 months (by booking only). If you're keen on a curated menu of fresh ocean produce, that is something to go for. If cocktails are your thing, you can have your first tipple of the night at Humpback and do as we did, by following dinner up with drinks at their other bar upstairs, Gibson
3
I was initially served by a staff who claimed its his first day at work, since its my first time dining at the restaurant, I asked him to recommend. He told me it his first day at work , thus he is not familiar at all with the menu, that is not professional at all, I asked him to ask another of his colleague to help. There are three of us, only I ordered a cocktail (watermelon sangria), it took a very long time before I was served, I had to ask three times. The food is not too bad, they need to improve on the service
4
Came here on recommendation by a Friend for our gathering and was mightily pleased! The oysters during Happy Hour was pretty good at $2-3 a piece! There were around 5 types to choose from but you have to order the "Fat Bastxxd" because that's still the best! Have been thinking of it ever since! Had the iberico pork and Calamari which was pretty good too! Would recommend ordering the former and I'm definitely hearing back soon to try the cocktails with more oysters!
5
The oysters are fresh and juicy. The cocktail and the other dishes on the menu are delicious too... the staffs are very friendly and always looking out to our needs.
5
My second visit and it sure didn't disappoint. The oysters were good and fresh! Friendly staff, atmosphere is nice and had a great dinner here!
4
So glad to find really good oysters at Happy Hour prices. Excellent service. It was not that crowded on a monday so it is good for a date
5
Went to the restaurant with my wife for her birthday. Good oysters, ordered some vegetable dishes and they were also excellent. Took a bit longer to serve than I would expect for raw food. Staff was friendly, environment was not too loud.
3
The drinks are good, the atmosphere seemed to be gearing towards the hipsters crowd. The food is decent with great music selection
4
My third visit to humpback. The oysters never fail to disappoint and the fish and chips are extraordinary.Their oysters menu change every week, and they are very fresh and creamy! Although I think i had a bad oyster (tasted funky and watery) on sunday's visit and ended up with stomach flu, I will still come back as the other visits have been pleasant. Doesnt hurt for the affordable oysters during happy hour as well
5
Have been there about half a dozen times this year. Food, ambience and service was great! My girlfriend didn't like the aircon draft and the attendant turned it down for us. They give us our space and was attentive at all course. Generally the staff looks happy to be of service to us which in Singapore is quite RARE. The oysters were out of this world and the wine was pretty reasonable. The other foods like the kale and seafood sausage has always been pretty consistent. We had 2 rounds of oysters which is like 10 oysters each and ended paying about $98 per person with wine and food, that is quite reasonable
5
If you are a big fan of oysters, humpback is for you. Multiple varieties of oysters. If you are not a fan of oysters, fear not, there are plenty of other dishes that's are equally good. The portions are small so if you are in a big group, you might be able to order all the dishes in the menu.
4
Had a brunch with my friends today. We started with oysters, the oysters are fresh and good! Where else to find a cheap and good oysters in Singapore! Eggs benedict is nice as well, followed by the fish and chips. Buttermilk chicken and ribs are so so. Oysters omellete looks good but below are expectationService is good and attentive, overall i ll come back for more oysters
5
The casual and bustling atmosphere makes it a great place to wind down especially from a hard day at work! Staff was attentive and most willing to offer a suggestion or two to my satisfaction. Love the freshness of the oysters! We were given counter seats even though I made reservations ahead, but chatting with the ever friendly bartender and watching the staff shucking endless orders of oysters made it all up
5
What a neat little find... super relaxed, great fresh food, excellent happier hours and very friendly staff. Definitely going back to happy hour oysters more regularly.
5
Great food, great music, great location and most importantly, attentive staff... what more could my friends and I ask for a Friday night out?
4
That was my 2nd visit. They offer all-day happy hour oysters every Monday, their oysters are fresh. Their cocktails are great too. Excellent service, friendly staff.
5
Each & every time I go to humpback I love it! The food is great, the staff are attentive and friendly & the oysters- amazing!!!!
5
Great ambiance, friendly and attentive staff, great "bar food" and most importantly fantastic oysters! One of the few places I keep coming back to.
5
Fresh oysters, good cooked seafood. And special appetisers. Just the cocktails ... choose wine is better.
4
Absolutely loved the dishes at this place! Had a great variety of vegetarian dishes me which were cooked so well & full of great Flavours ! Definitely will be going back!
2
Happy hours oysters @3 ea. great deal except- all other dishes were mini portion sizes. Super Mini. Plates small n not even half filled.- they replaced Hama Hama oyster due to seasonality and the replacement wasn't great- they ran out of 2 out of 4 types of oysters- oysters served on more water than ice resulted in desperate attempt to fish oysters out so quickly before oyster soup is created. This is not acceptable.Because of mini plates .. ended up spending more than expectedBut still loved the oysters based in past visits, pls put hamahama back or a nice equivalen
3
First time visit , heard of their fresh oyster from my colleagues and nice cocktails. It's was very interesting and a nice try to a different cafe/ restaurant . We enjoyed the food here and the staff is very knowledgable of their food hence , gave us in details on their food description. Their menu is different from weekend and weekday. So, I can't try their grilled cabbage which I wanted to try. Egg Benedict is not so worth it but I can say it's special . It's different from all those egg Benedict that serve at those common cafe. ( picture attached )
5
We came here for Sunday brunch and had a very pleasant time. The oysters were shucked right in front of us by a lovely man (we sat at the bar). Not only was it fresh but it was so delicious! The food was small in servings (to share) with good variety of seafood offerings. Highly recommended for adults
5
Had amazing oysters, superb sea sausage and trout out of this world, well recommended by super friendly staff, in a great and relaxed atmosphere
4
The oysters were really fresh and delicious. The cafe is beautiful and great to chill out for a weekend.
4
The food was a little small in portion but it was tasty. We were give. the bar seat which was a little uncomfortable but given the interaction with the service crew we had, we had no regret.
4
Great food and great service. Tasty Oyster at more than 50% off the normal price during happy hours.
5
Oysters were very fresh especially the hama hama. We also had the kale, scallops, cheese balls and beef. All were delicious
5
Had a few dozen oysters with friends and family. Very fresh and goes well with prosecco. The wagyu beef is good too.
4
Was here for lunch on a Sunday (hence we had the Sunday brunch menu). They do their bread and the lobster roll very well, although it was a bit pricey for the size ($45). We also ordered the King Crab Leg and the Salmon Roe Dip. Spent a total of about $120 without alcohol and desserts
3
First of all, we will probably go back to this place. Reasons are simple: most of the food was great, nice ambiance/atmosphere, friendly staff and my wife really liked the oysters. On Mondays apparently happy hour all day long. However, we ordered 6 dishes (six). They all arrived within 15 minutes. So in order not to eat everything cold, we quickly ate everything, hence we were finished within 25 minutes. A new record in Singapore! Seriously, if the restaurant is 85% empty on a weekday evening, you should be able to bring the dishes with just a little bit more time in between. Except for the cheese balls which noboby liked, all the other food was really good. Next time we'll make sure to tell them in advance not to bring all at once. Not good service. Too fast is too fast. Second area where there's room for improvement is the volume of the music. I would suppose it's difficult to go there with more than just two people because you will not be able to talk to one another with the music so (just too) loud. I went to the bathroom and could still sing along because it was really much too loud. And as we were out of the restaurant in less than half an hour, we didn't bother to ask. After dinner, we went to another place to have more quiet drinks just around the corner because there's plenty of choice in that area. So all in all, we'll probably go back once to see how consistent they are but we'll ask to turn the volume down and also not to rush the dishes too much
4
Food and cocktails worth the try. Oysters are a good variety and fresh. Very small portions. Don't expect to leave with a full stomach. Very noisy place with good music but bad speakers. Cannot hold a conversation without shouting. Young waiter actually leaned on our table while speaking to the next table apparently his friends. We were horrid. Probably will go just one more time before we move to the next new restaurant in touc
5
Happy hour oysters are good and cheap. Super fresh. Had a selection of 5 types of oysters when we were there. Food was really very well done. Innovative cooking techniques and well presented. Kale salad came with raw kale topped with deep fried crispy kale, similar in texture to nori (seaweed) sheets. Tossed with compressed pears to give a sweetness to the dishOcean trout was quick cured then sous vide, keeping it nice and moist while flavourful due to the curing processMake a reservation as they are popular. If you walk-in, you will most probably get a bar seat only which is also quite fun as you get to chit chat with the 2 guys who helm the place
2
Food was generally the weakest link in this restaurant. The menu was not exciting and the dishes came out all under seasoned. With the exception of the fresh oysters (obviously)... Cocktails were great but there's a reason why people only stay for happy hour.
5
Great and cosy place to enjoy diverse type of oysters from US, especially imported for them.
Interesting twist of the classic Negroni.
Warm and welcoming service.
5
They were so good they were still moving when I squeezed the lemon slice over!!! And the servings were great. The music was incredible, had such a great time there. Thank you
4
An easy afterwork dinner. The seafood sausage was a treat and the Brussels sprouts delicious. My friend loved the oysters too. Funky little place lots of fun
5
It was refreshing to visit an establishment where cups are refilled without prompting, greeted with warmth by all the servers and made comfortable like you are a guest at someone's home. Everything I ate, I liked. Will visit soon!!!
5
Very good quality of food throughtout. Came here a couple of weeks ago to satisfy my wive's oyster craving and came for her birthday again. Interesting takes for some dishes while letting the ingredients speak for itself. Of course oysters during happy hour is the best value!! Eld inlet and hamahama for the win!
5
Every time I go to Humpback it's busy, no matter which day of the week. In a city with so much choice, that's a rarity and speaks volumes about the great atmosphere, food and service. A great little informal spot for friends or couples. My new favourite hangout!
3
Great for happy hour oysters. The sea urchin was watery and lack taste. My friends and I weren't very impressed with the cheese balls (tasted more like flour balls) and the burrata (too runny and the sourdough under it was hard) Cabbage, Seafood sausage and Lobster roll were unimpressive. The churros were great though. Would probably come back just for pre-dinner cocktails/drinks.
5
I went to Humpback for dinner on a Thursday night with my family. I had made a reservation on Chope beforehand. Humpback is a tiny restaurant tucked away at Bukit Pasoh, giving it the perfect hidden find atmosphere. For seating, there is a bar area which I assume you can view oysters being shucked, main seating area on bar stools and then a small area outside.Oysters are just $3 each during happy hour, super affordable for the quality. Oysters were well shucked, had enough of a briny taste which I like and were plump and juicy. My personal favourite was the Hama Hama and I tried all on the menu.I also tried other items on the menu and all were delicious, although to note that these are tapas portioned. I would recommend the lobster roll, which was very well done.Despite all the good food, it was the service standard that really stood out for me. The staff were brilliant - attentive, friendly and professional but not overbearing at all. They really made this dinner special and I am very appreciative!Overall, we spent $80+ per person. I look forward to visiting again
5
I almost fell upon this restaurant when I was looking for great dining options in Singapore. I arrived, was welcomed warmly at the door and seated at the bar (as I had requested). The room is fantastic, a fresh, modern and engaging space which a sophisticated & subtle nod to the seafood driven cuisine. The menu offered so many great choices & was concise and cleverly built. I had three outstanding dishes, each carefully considered, full of bright bold flavour and some fun ingredient combinations....serious culinary food that doesn't take itself too seriously! Brilliantly executed and delicious to eat! The staff were all excellent, however I must mention the incredible bartender who took care of me. She was without doubt one of the most truly hospitable bartenders I've ever had the pleasure of being served by. Her exceptional knowledge of the dishes and a clear passion for food and service was what made my experience at humpback one of the truly remarkable dining experiences in Singapore. I'll always return to this restaurant when I visit Singapore again and will enthusiastically recommend it to anyone.
4
This was a lovely place. Very relaxed atmosphere. The service was great and the food delicious. The star of meal was the wide selection of oysters
5
Excellent service, oysters and unique and interesting little bites that can be served in larger portions for the hungry.
Good drinks menu too.
5
Yummilicious food! Worth the bill! Was there for vday, even my fiance said the food was too good for a vday and instead suits for anniversaries :D
5
I went I the morning at 11am on Sunday. There was a very attentive and friendly bartender who shucked oysters for us. Sundays are happy hours for oysters at $3 EA.
4
Cool place to chill. Easy to locate, right outside outram station exit h. Friendly service staff, good food, nice cool place for gatherings or chilling.
5
I went looking for a light meal but also something new and creative. Humpback was a brilliant choice. The dishes that interested me most were the roasted pumpkin in tzatziki sauce with fresh mint and macadamia nuts, and their melt in your mouth fish sausages in a chorizo gravy with cracklings. Both dishes were genius. And don't forget desert. Their flourless chocolate cake [and you could smell the bourbon from a meter away] was perfect.The staff was very friendly and attentive, and the place was spotless. If you sit at the counter in front of the kitchen you will be impressed. Happy hour specials include huge plates of oysters. And there were a number of couples totally focused on each other and the oysters. So a great choice for couples, small groups or just by yourself, but dinner only during the week. They open at 5PM and stay open late. Their website gives their weekend hours
5
Had brunch on a Sunday and had the oysters, sea urchin, fried egg and lobster roll. Great environment and fantastic service. The food was great as well, they have both a small sized portion and full sized so you can have more to try out and not be overly full.
4
Visited Humpback recently for their "Smokey" Chef's Table Special to celebrate my friend's birthday. I have always enjoyed sitting near the kitchen and watching the Chef's at work.Service: We were seated at our table very promptly. Minor hiccup in the service at the beginning, and perhaps the specials could have been explained a little more clearly, but apart from that, the evening progressed well. Expectedly for a chef's table event, the chefs' tried to engage with us - some were more natural and better than others - but good effort. The service staff managed to sneak up and surprise my friend with a mousse cake and a song - that was lovely! Thank you!Food:We had a few oysters, the set menu for the evening together with the cocktail pairing. Oysters were nice and fresh as always. In terms of the "smokey" element in the food, it was less noticeable as the menu progressed, but overall the food was very enjoyable, with the exception of the monkfish, which was rather firm and rubbery. Cocktails complemented the dishes well, and we appreciated the detailed explanation about each cocktail when we were served.We enjoyed our evening :)
4
service was excellent as it was my first time there.the waitress even came out to pick me up fr my car when I called to say I am stuck in it as it was pouring.food was good too but was disappointed dat 2 of the choices of oysters ran out by 630pm.will be back the 3rd time
5
We saw the oyster promotion at Humpback for sunday and monday and decided to give it a try. We were not disappointed. It was a gd experience as we get to try 4 different flavourful oysters at a reasonable priceï¼Œat $3 a piece. The $2 a piece oyster was unavailable during our visit but will hope to try that in our nx visit. We also had a taste of tge burrata cheese, rainbow trout and chicken breast.
5
I agree with the many positive reviews. I have been there twice and was not disappointed. I think I tasted almost everything from the menu and I was not disappointed with a single dish. The trout is my favorite.
5
I really like his place. Good ambiance, great service and very good food. The prices are reasonable, especially during happy hour, and the oysters are fantastic
5
I've always been impressed with the food quality and consistency at Humpback! In addition, their service is always stellar, definitely will be back!
5
I think the title says it all - where else can you get Kumamoto oysters in Singapore for $3/piece during happy hour? Nowhere. Their food is also fantastic!
5
From our hotel only 1 minute walk. From outside u almost recognize this special seafood place. Not only the restaurant in bistrostyle is great... also the staff very friendly. We ate 2 oyster plates and added the burrata and also lobster sandwich. We will recommend this place and also back.
4
The food is undoubtedly delicious, and I particularly enjoyed the Burrata and the trout dishes. The food service is excellent, though they could slightly quicker with the drinks. The menu recommends 6(-8?) dishes per couple but we had 4 and that seemed like plenty unless you're making a big night of it. Definitely worth getting an earlier table so you can take advantage of happy hour before 8.Seats at the bar are great and the atmosphere is welcoming, but seats in the main area probably have better lighting.
5
Finding this restaurant was a little difficult and out of the way but was definitely worth it. Their specialty is oysters, and they are delicious but at $7 SGD a piece they are a little pricy, I belive they have a half price day, something to check out. The menu is amazing though with lots of seafood. We had the the sea urchin and uniquely prepared rainbow trout that was amazing. The bread and burratta was melt in your mouth. The flourless chocolate cake for dessert was "to die for" and one of the best deserts ever. The atmosphere was a little eclectic but the food was absolute 5 star fine dining! All be it in a casual setting. Chef Polo is fantastic and if he keeps creating amazing food like this he will be snapped up by a posh 5 star restaurant in no time
5
Was lucky enough to dine at Humpback on Saturday evening - the food and the service here are always 1st class - I could list the dishes one by one, but all were great - started with oysters, (the happy hour oyster special is fantastic value) progressed to scallop sashimi, sea urchin, trout,, seafood sausage (yes seafood sausage!) etc etc....Great wines by the glass, and fantastic cocktails. This was my 4th visit and the consistency and quality is to be commended. Thank you for a great meal
5
$3 per oyster - I think you would find it very hard to beat this pricing. But it happens every night from 5 to 8pm and all day Mondays and Sundays. These are high quality oysters too - this time they had 3 different variety including the Blue pool (very fleshy). Other times they have the very popular Kumamoto and Shigoku etc. Also they have an excellent bar!! So much so that when we went bar hopping on this particular, we eventually decided to come back here for one last drink. Excellent bar!
5
Another return visit to Humpback. love the happy hour oysters (2-3 bucks a pop!) and drinks. My favorite dish here has to be the grilled cabbage. It is amazing how such a humble vegetable can taste so wonderful! Wait staff are friendly and attentive and the ambience is lively. I believe they change their menu once in a while, so there will always be new dishes to try out. Humpback is my happy place after a long work day.
4
great place with friends. oysters on happy hour is great value and delicious. Reserve even on weekdays.
5
oyster damn good,super fresh.
the Cabbage and the chicken breast was damn amazing.
havent tried the other things, but no doubt i'll come back to try the others.
5
Fantastic place for seafood! Great place to come with friends as the portions are great for sharing. Staff were so attentively and friendly too!
5
Great venue and wonderful food to share with friends. We ordered a selection and everything was delicious.
5
I always have such a great time at Humpback. The food is great, music is awesome and the staff are so friendly and attentive.
5
My husband took me to Humpback after eating there on his own while I was out of town. He invited me because it is hard to find restaurants in Singapore that have Vegetarian Set Menus. Humpback just happened to be having a chef's table with a veggie set as well as a meat/fish set. We were blown away! It was just stunning. EVERY dish we had was as amazing as the next. In fact, when the meal ended, I couldn't decide which one was my favourite. Even the dessert blew me away. I've lived in Singapore for 18-years and I've never had a meal this good (including carnivore food at Iggy's, St. Pierre, and other "Michelin" restaurants). Unfortunately, the vegetarian set isn't available all the time. I can attest to the chef's ability and the superior quality of the food and service. I'll definitely recommend it and return
5
We enjoyed the one for one deal on oysters during their happy hour and they were really fresh and delectable. Our firm favourite was the Hama Hama - voluptuous, meaty slivers of meat that glide down the throats like velvet. In addition, we also tried a few of their cocktails and my favourite is the Signature Lobster Bloody Mary, which even comes with a chunk of lobster meat atop the drink. Overall, it was a great dining experience and I'll be back for more.
4
Unlike the Walrus and the Carpenter of Carroll's verse, we didn't have to lure the oysters from their beds: they came to us - freshly shucked on ice - at Humpback. As in Carroll's verse, all of them were fat: succulent Coromandels and Kumamotos, and flavourful Fat Bastards (yes, that's an oyster variety). And the best thing was, they only cost S$2-3 (approx. £1-1.50) each at brunch!Actually, it got better: Humpback also do some excellent small plates. We had the sea urchins with cauliflower purée, served with warm fluffy brioche, and the devilled eggs with fish mousse and roe.Brunch wouldn't be brunch without a bit of booze, and Humpback have a gratifyingly long drinks list. You can even customise your Bloody Mary, picking your juice (tomato, clamato or a blend), spirit (gin, tequila or vodka), and up to two condiments (I went for a dash of sherry and some horse radish).Overall, a very satisfying, laid-back brunch. For as long as there's an 'r' in the month and we're in town, we plan to keep coming back
5
Humpback is a smart idea, firstly theres the building a beautiful open colonial house with a terrace and a very cool fit out, there are oysters being freshly shucked at the large bar and drinks being made. They make in my opinion one of the best gin and tonics in Singapore and the service is in the main friendly and fast.The food though is where they shine, stick with the vegetable plates the kale and the cabbage (yes cabbage trust me!!) and then the seafood is amazing the rainbow trout is sensational.When done head round the corner to Flagship for an amazing cocktail or a whiskey
5
We went here last night on a friends recommendation and didn't check TripAdvisor til afterwards so was very surprised to see overall position in Singapore. This restaurant deserves to be far higher, we loved it. I love oysters so the 19:30 table was perfect for happy hour, my partner loves lobster roll so we were two very happy campers. The other dishes were eclectic and refreshingly different. Leave space for dessert as the flourless chocolate tart has to be one of the best desserts I have ever tasted.
4
This is our 1st time to the restaurant. And we were surprised by menu where they served mainly if not all seafood dishes. Oysters were fresh and tasty. Will visit them again!
5
from the freshness of the oysters, the sparkle of the elderflower cocktails, and lively atmosphere, Humpback was the perfect environment to entertain 2 discerning clients from Europe, who loved the combination of good food and ingredients in a shop house environment. A very fun evening!
5
Oyster is the only Value (happy hour) absolutely fresh! Other food portion are small, price consider steep.

Good quality place for Sunday brunch, but the oyster selection has shrunk from a few months ago. Drinks are pretty good as well!
5
Have to try the oysters happy hour. They have different types and worth going for. Tastes really good together with bubbly wines.
5
Best place to go for oysters, whether or not you are an oyster lover! Bound to make you a convert! ;)

We went Humpback mostly for the oysters initially, as their reviews are pretty good. We were not disappointed: great choice of fresh oysters mostly from the US. We took a selection of 6 different oysters: they were all tasty in their own different way. Good selection of wines as well. We picked a nice Sauvignon blanc which went great with the oysters. We then tried a selection of other dishes. It was just great food: fresh and tasty in a sometimes innovative way.The restaurant is nice with both indoor and outdoor seatings. It is nicely crowded with mostly young couples. The service is excellent which unfortunately becomes a rarity in Singapore nowadays. Parking in this area is not easy. Access by taxi is recommended. Enjoy!

Cozy and hip environment. They seemed not very used to solo traveller though, I'm not a loner, I'm just on business trip.Happy hour menu till 8pm. Perfect bargain for the fresh oysters @ $2-3 each, also had a house sparkling brut@$13.Then had the sea urchin snack and the hamachi ceviche. Both are unrivalled

When you're paying an average of $40 per head for a main and a drink, you expect to come away feeling reasonably full. We weren't anywhere close to that. Portion sizes are laughable. The lobster roll we received had a miserable 8 chunks of lobster and a huge bun for $39. Wagyu steak and eggs for $32 had maybe 80gms of meat, a sunny side up and some cauliflower pieces. Don't get me wrong - food quality was great but doesn't justify the price. Plenty of other cafes in this city with much more reasonable offerings

Food was so good that we wanted to order everything on the menu. Alas we didnt have the appetite to allow that to happen.Service was great as well. Staff were smiley, chatty and friendly. Only thing if i had to pick was that the tables were not big enough for all our orders haha
5
Absolutely love Humpback and their Sunday brunch. Such a good atmosphere, lovely staff, great food. Love the
Bloody Mary menu. Perfect place for a casual Sunday brunch with husband or friends:)
4
Good dinner but small portion - expensive for what you get though but will certainly return as it was excellent
5
The oysters are excellence, seems cant have enough of it:)
The cabbage is supprising yummy.
The staffs are very attentive.
Good experience!
4
Tasty food - the rainbow trout was impressive! Attentive service staff, chill vibes, awesome groovy playlist, I didn't want to leave!
5
second visit. we love the oysters here especially during happy hour! had to control as we're not that young anymore ): the bread and dip is really good too.
5
Seriously, Humpback has by far the best ongoing oyster promotion, offering a range of FIVE different types between SGD 2 to 3. Oysters were fresh with plump flesh and affordably priced. The kale salad is also a must order. Really unique combination of crispy kale on top of kale drenched in buttermilk. Service was friendly and the staffs do know their food well. Reservation is a MUST. Worth revisiting again
5
We went in for dinner, reservations recommended as the place is packed. The oysters, salmon dip, cheese balls, calamari, lobster roll and the pork is to die for. Each bite is a burst of new and uniquely combined ingredients. Amazingly fresh and a genuine surprise with every bite. Highly recommended and I would go in here again and again and again.
4
We had the Chef's Table Menu (Surf and Turf) and all the dishes demonstrated good cooking skills with fresh ingredients. The progression of the menu is also clear to the diner, which showed that thought was put into planning the courses in the menu. Chefs and wait staff were very friendly, giving us warm service and enthusiastic explanations about each dis

if you look for a place to experience Seattle based-food, the Humpback is the place to go. We were there with friends and we had such a good time. the atmosphere is friendly, open and cool. The food is excellent and the team is very professional, helping you on the menu suggestions and keeping an eye on the table to ensure that wine or water is always in glasses. We only had a small problem with the delay of one dish for a friend and we had all finished when she received her order. despite this small problem, I recommend this place if you want to spend an enjoyable evening and have very good food
5
I love it every time I go. The ambience is great, music is great (everyone I bring always likes the music) food is so fresh and always always the same standard and quality every time I go. They're happy hour deals are great, the service is great, and the air-conditioning is great (not too cold, which I appreciate. Hahaha!). I love bringing people here. And every single person always enjoys themselves and the food.
5
Menu was small but everything on the menu was well executed. Loved the Brussel sprouts and how it was charred. Had the best pork ever! Seafood sausage was jus fresh and flavorsome!
5
One of my favorite restaurants which I frequent about once or twice a month. The oysters are very fresh and is the main attraction. Other items on the menu are creative and will please your foodie tastebuds. I'm always looking to the next visit.
5
Happy hour from 5 to 8pm. Oysters were all good regardless what type. Fresh. Lobster roll was tasty despite the pricey tag but huge chunks of lobster meat
5
I love the steak and chinchilok, white sangria and matcha roll. Will definitely be back to try the other dishes.
4
The diverse and appetising menu made me want to order everything!! Oysters are awesomely fresh and on happy hour til 8pm.. Service was excellent. Table placing was a tad bit squeezy though. Overall a pleasant experience. Would come back for the food!!
5
Great food although slightly slow service. Oysters were pretty fresh and the tapas menu had a good range. Will definitely be back to this adorable place!
5
The food was top notch, amazing, words can't describe some of these dishes. I would highly recommend it.

You wont regret making a booking at Humpback! A casual, relaxed atmosphere, whether its an evening meal or a chilled out Sunday brunch. The staff are pleasant, friendly, knowledgeable and go out their way to help you enjoy your experince. The food is simply amazing, the team do an awesome job! Great value and extremely inventive. If its oysters you love - I don't think there are better in Singapore. As fresh as you like and a wide selection of types, catering for all (Look out for the happy hour specials).Love the cocktails, customised & personalised Bloody Mary's, beers, ciders and wines.As the title says - in my belief, 'you cant go wrong' here
4
This is my second time to humpback and it is still as lovely as I remember it was the first.Enjoyed the happy hour for the drinks and oysters. All is good except the portions were a bit small for the price. Will love to visit back the next time
5
It was my second time there and the standards were consistent. All my friends were so impressed and the Happy Hour deals were very reasonable. The staff were nice and accommodating to our constant requests. Had a great time stuffing our faces! Oh, and the music was good. Not too loud and a good range of genres
5
I've been here a couple of times and had brought friends here too. the food was excellent. oysters were fresh. service was impeccable. i have no complains. Will def be coming back again.
4
Shared 9 dishes between 3 of us and we really enjoyed the kale salad, pork and sea urchin! Also enjoyed the cocktails we ordered. Happy hour is from 5 to 8 so order the oysters during this period, v worth it!
5
Great seafood and small plates with a laidback vibe.
Yummy oysters! Seafood platter was good - fresh and lightly seasoned, without masking it's natural sweetness.
Will go again!
4
Excellent food n accessible location. Would recommend to make a reservation as there are not a lot of tables.
4
Pretty good food, great oysters brunch experience! Music was a little too loud, makes it very herd to talk among friends.
5
Humpback delivered, we booked only 30 min prior to arrival on a Friday and scored seats at the bar so where are to watch the cocktail makers and oyster shuckers.We were surprised a number of times by the dishes notably the scallops, though my favourite was the lobster roll.The staff were friendly, at one point singing to the music and racing each other to fill our water glasses. The atmosphere is relaxed with music at a level you comfortable talk over and the venue is a size that even a big(ish) group should dominate
4
Went there to celebrate a friend's birthday with a few foodie friends. The seafood was very fresh. The service wasn't too shabby. Unfortunately we were seated near the entrance on the inside, and it was very humid and not very comfortable. Perhaps a more effective air curtain would help. We did get moved further in when a table was available and that helped. Would still recommend it.
4
We ordered a dozen happy hour oysters (only two types were on offer that day), a couple of cocktails, the scallop starter and a calamari main to share. The oysters and scallop took their time to arrive. The scallop was delicious but very small. (I'm using the singular because I'm pretty sure it was one scallop sliced into three parts.) The calamari being a main dish was bigger but still on the small side. It was tasty though. The oysters and cocktails were alright. It was a weeknight but the place was reasonably patronised and there was a nice easygoing vibe. Service was great - friendly and attentive
3
This is my second time at the restaurant and it was kind of empty again The restaurant is very brightly lit which is not great for dinner lighting. The food is not bad but the portions are tiny for the price. We each paid around $90+, we had appetizers and shared one main and 1 or 2 alcholic drinks each
4
My friend and I came for dinner. We started with the oysters (one of each) since it was happy hour. Super fresh. Then we had the sea urchin, although the portion was small, every bite was amazing. Next, we had the kale. The flavours worked well. As for the meats, we had the chicken breast which was tender and juicy. And not forgetting the rainbow trout which was cooked to perfection. To end the meal, we had the churros. Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, it complimented the salted caramel cream. Overall, we enjoyed the food, service and ambience. Would be back for more
4
Very good food but small portions and hence feel slightly pricier. Ambience is average , good service . Oysters are good with nice variety
3
Was there with the girls after work. Tucked in the neat location and alongside numerous restaurants, it is a cosy restaurant.
5
Delicious oysters, great food, excellent service, fun atmosphere, yummy bubbles, easy location to find!
5
oysters are fresh. service attention. all other food items are excellent. cannot ask for more. will be coming back
5
Fresh food with good culinary skills of chef. One can't go wrong with that. My parents were very happy.
5
Love how friendly the staff are, and the attention they pay to each table. Service like this is rare these days :p
5
Really nice place, Good service. Especially, something with scallops tasted really good.
High chair doesn't suit for long staying.
5
Delicious oysters, attentive service. Pricey, but that's Singapore. Staff were attentive and had good knowledge of menu. Would definitely return.
4
Friendly service and my food was very good. My 3 star rating is related to the small portions made smaller because a few pieces of the fish in ceviche were not edible. The flavor combination was fantastic. I also ordered dessert which again was delicious but small. I thought the cost was slightly high in relation to the amount of food
5
Stumbled into this place off the street on a Saturday night for seats at the bar. We tried the happy hour cocktails, oysters and a couple of the tapas style dishes. All were excellent. Must try: burrata in the garden section ; sol Cubano cocktail for sour tastes and the elderflower spritz for sweet.
5
A must visit for simple beautifully presented food. We had cabbage, tuna, savoury clams and finished with the most amazing 'bun mixture' like chocolate mousse. Recommend a kitchen view table to watch the masters at work. Service great and very attentive.
4
The service and food is good. But a little pricey for the small portion. For big eaters not too suitable.
4
Nice atmosphere, nice service and very good food with revisited ingredients in an original and subtile way (e.g. Old carrots with pistachio, eggplants with blackberry)
We really enjoyed our time there!
4
A new addition to the nascent bar scene along Bukit Pasoh Road, by the team behind the successful bar Jigger & Pony.
This is one of a 3-in-1 dining establishment comprising also of a cocktail bar and whisky place.
5
I stumbled across this place the other night - had a glass of wine. Which tuned into a few glasses..then some whisky and my colleague also had a an oyster. We were that impressed with the service and attention to detail we decided to go back for dinner the next night. It is quite simply the best food I have had in Singapore. Plain simple ingredients are combined to make unfussy really good dishes to a very high standard! Loved absolutely everything we had. The burrata was lovely, as was my yellowfin tuna with cucumber granita and avocado. That was outstanding!! Loved every second of the atmosphere music and the staff's service levels and attitude were brilliant. There is nothing i can complain about here - go and enjoy the simple pleasure that is Humpback.....I will most certainly be back oin my return to Singapore

A girlfriend & I went on a catchup trip on Tues night to try out Humpback after great reviews by friends. Needless to say, they were right and we loved it!The ambience is casual and staff were welcoming, attentive & informative. While ordering we asked a few questions and they were able to answer with coherence and without guidance from the manager (which is rare in Singapore!)The piece de resistance are the Hama Hama oysters - freshly flown in from Seattle, they're juicy and delicious! Served together with a special sauce, a slice of lemon and some horseradish, they're some of the best oysters you'll find in Singapore. Next time I go, I'm happy to spend the night chucking these down with a glass of their Spanish Rioja rose in hand. However, we did decide to try other dishes too which also satisfied us. From "Snacks", we ordered the Sea Urchin and Bread & Dip, from "Garden" the Cabbage and from "Seafood" the Rainbow Trout and Manila clams. All dishes were good but my least favourite was probably the Rainbow Trout - it needed some seasoning or spice to it. Lastly, we finished off with the Valrhona Chocolate Mousse which was to die for!Overall, we spent $70-75 per person on the food, which wasn't bad at all given how much we ate and enjoyed. All in all, a good experience at this establishment, and I'll be happy to visit again.

It's an oyster bar but the side dishes are superb and worth a visit alone. An interesting drinks menu, and nice vibe. The service is good and the prices reasonable. The only downside was the length of time for oyster service, about thirty minutes, though to be fair the oyster chef was working hard all night
5
We came here to celebrate BFF birthday. The service was very good. All the foods we ordered were properly introduced to us. All the foods are meant for sharing so be prepared for it. Also all the foods are in a very small portion but very tasty. The after effect taste is fantastic. It is a bit dear on the bill but worth a visit to try something new. Remember to request a table outside because during peak hour the noise is very high and loud. Trust me on this
4
The oysters were fresh and delicious and all the food was excellent. Pretty good wine list though would be nice to have some NW US wines to match the oysters. Staff are attentive but the kitchen was completely overwhelmed on a Friday and the wait for one of our dishes was 90 minutes! Fun vibe, good tunes and we'll def go back.
5
Went last night with a girlfriend who is vegetarian, so we stuck to the veg dishes, which were all excellent. With a 1/2 bottle of wine cost of meal was reasonable. Great atmosphere and service. I hope to return soon, and definitely recommend. One recommendation would be to order in stages -- we ordered all the small plates in a single go, and everything came out in rapid succession
