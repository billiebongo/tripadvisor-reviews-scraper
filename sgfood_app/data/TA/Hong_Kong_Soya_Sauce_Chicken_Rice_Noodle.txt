Nice place for good food. Very busy but they do the job. Noodles are good and so is rice. Westerns may prefer Char Sui pork to chicken which has bones and skin. But it is worth a try for the price.
3
Expected so much more since we heard a lot about it - being Michelin star and all. The noodle was better than the rice, much better chicken rice and noodles elsewhere, especially in a hawker setting. Not as cheap too.
4
This place has a system down that works real well, food is served quite quickly, place is clean and price is cheap!The rice options were good, but the noodle options were fantastic.Any choice of meat is good, some of the bbq pork a little burn for my liking
4
First- we have problems to find this place, because there is not big signboard of this restaurant. When we found it we felt as in fast food cafe, ordered food in computer, got order no and waited when food will be done. Food- good, but there was a mess in our plates, I thing it because there are a lot of people and stuff trying to make food fast so they serve it plates messy. Taste- good, specially sauce. There is no duck, only chicken and pork, but for 5 $ it was very good :
4
We have been very curious about this restaurant. You know, we have read about it before we came to Singapore, those things about Michelin star. Well, it was interesting experience, I can recommend that to others, but...There was a long line around 6 pm in this restaurant. It took about 30 minutes, then we were able to order, after few minutes we got the food, but it was not possible to sit somewhere, but on the street (no chair, no table).The chicken itself was tasting good, only it was just few pieces, so I can recommend something more, if you are hungry. The pork was better then chicken, so combine it, then you will pay little bit more, you will be satisfied.I think there is lot of very good (street food) restaurants in Singapore, so if you will not visit this, don't be sad
4
We had to queue for a few minutes and the formica-topped tables were very crowded with diners. The menu is simple and there was no great choice. The chicken was very tasty, though we cannot compare the quality as we did not taste similar dishes elsewhere. On the whole this was a very reasonable lunch at a fantastically modest price
3
Meal for 2 approx $20 including drinksFirst, went at 6pm and had to wait about 25 minutes in line to order and get food.We ordered the famous soy sauce chicken, the pork and Chinese sausage.1) please do not order the Chinese sausage, we didn’t even finish it, it’s so bad2) The pork was okay. But not something I will order again3) The famous soya sauce chicken was not bad for less than $4, the chicken was softer than usual, which was good.The place is okay for the price. No complaints there. Overall, there are similar places in SG where you don’t have to wait so much for the food. It’s a 50/50 for me.
4
It is better now to have any expectations before coming here. The fact that it has been awarded a Michelin star has nothing to do with a Michelin restaurant ( the luxurious ones). This star has been awarded for a street food restaurant not for a proper restaurant, so thinking of this, it is a good place to eat.There are a few things missing, such as well trained staff, but again, this is street food.The overall experience is great, I loved the duck! And it is not expensive at all (this may be subjective though).Good to give it a try
3
The food here was fine. But that is it. Nothing special. Certainly not the Michelin fare you get elsewhere. Saying that it was worth going to the hawker centre and enjoying the food and atmosphere. We had better food at another food stall just round the corner. The set up is ideal and you can get food and drink from lots of different stalls and sit in the middle. Great experience
3
We were curious about this 1-star Michelin restaurant and wanted to try it. So, we ordered the famous Soya Sauce Chicken rice noodle just like everyone else did. There was nothing special about this dish, and the taste was OK and average. Not sure I would consider it a Michelin worthy dish
1
Surly lack of service from a rude and uninterested counter person followed by terrible food. The chicken was cold and so undercooked that it was bloody, not to mention chopped through the bone. The rice was standard, bland boiled and the noodles tasteless. This fast food place sells itself based on being the cheapest Michelin starred restaurant in the World. I cannot imagine it will keep that star for very long and we have no idea how it got that recognition in the first place.
2
If this place deserves a Michelin star, then I believe lots of other chicken rice in Singapore should be awarded as well. There is really nothing special about it; not in the taste nor in the presentation. I think many Singaporeans will agree that it's nothing special. Not to mention the staff, shouting to each other in front of customers in excitement in their language. If you have something funny to share, keep it until your break time or at least watch your volume. It's seriously embarrassing to hold a Michelin star with that kind of attitude
2
We waited in the line like everyone else ready to sample to famous and highly regarded soya chicken but it was very disappointing. Was a nice story to see from a corner stall inside the Chinatown complex into a corner restaurant. The self order system was simple to use. Just found the noodles bland and luke warm and the chicken itself tasteless and full of bones despite being breast meat. Would rather have tried other things
3
We came here purely because of the hype around the place and the fact that it’s earned a Michelin Star. We waited over 45 mins in line, and while I can’t complain about the price - $2.50, I have no idea why it got the Michelin Star - food was nice but there is no way I’d go back for a second serving. I can’t help but think who at the Michelin rating place is related to the owner or who paid who. It almost makes a mockery of their rating system. If you want some ok food, come here, but it’s certainly not worth the hype. Having said that - like many others, I had a severe case of FOMO just in case it did live up to the hype.
3
Compared to a lot of the other Chinese food in Singapore and Malaysia the food here is not that great. The char siu is a little bland and the rice doesn’t have the same taste as other char siu restaurants. Worth a visit to say you’ve been but not for foodies.
2
Well, disappointed highly if i consider it has been awarded a michelin star...the rice and chicken were warm-to-cold, chicken was bloody-raw in some parts. The dish was just an average hawker meal, nothing more nothing less. The girl at the desk was probably the most rude employee i ever met: she only said the amount i had to pay. Didn't ask what i wanted, and when i ended my purchase with a "thank you" she just pretended i wasn't even there
1
Bad service from old aunty cashier, very grumpy and not polite , i've already order 1 portion 250gr roasted pork, and she ask me "are you sure for this order 250gr roasted pork?" With Not clearly language english mandarin mix language,and she hit the table and looks so angry cause i didnt understand what she say,and i called my friend to talk with her and my friend explain what we mean, bad service! i already capture image with the face grumpy cashier! Customer service is number one

The chef started his food store at a hawker centre (cooked food centre selling a variety of inexpensive foods with a variety of standard. They are typically found in city centres in Asia). Hence it is a great achievement for him to receive one Michelin Star and most of us are very happy for him.After receiving the star, he opened a few restaurants in Singapore to broaden the outreach and business.This branch is located at the heart of China Town which is very convenient to visitors. The queue was surprising not very long on a Monday around 12 noon. About 8 persons in front of me queuing to place orders (in a self-serving setting). I decided to order take away to avoid the crowd and I only waited for less than 8 minutes to recive my orders. The efficiency at the restaurant was excellent with many staff preparing the foods.I ordered half a soya sauce chicken (S$13), a S$10 plate of roast pork, char siu (a very popular barbecued pork in Cantonese cuisine roasted with honey, Chinese spice-powders and sometime with a small amount of garlic paste), and roast pork-rib; plus a bowl of plain steamed rice at $0.80.While waiting to collect my order, I found the dishes were priced very reasonable (around S$5) and the amount of meats served on the dishes were generous. Besides serving the meats with steamed rice, one could choose noodles. One could order vegetable dishes too. The chicken was braised and served with a secret soya sauce which tasted like those slightly sweetened sauce usually used in braised duck and pig intestine with some herbal ingredients. The chicken meat was over-cooked and could be more softer and juicy. The skin of the roast pork could be more crispy and was not as good as those served by Crystal Jade Restaurants. The roasted pork rib tasted almost the same as the pork char siu except that the meat textual was slightly different.In summary, all the meats were sweet (to some, may be too sweet). I liked the char siu most as it had reminded me my childhood favourite char siu dishes
3
S$1.50 for a Michelin star meal? Lets see. First of all it was S$3:80, just saying. But then the food was good, the chicken really tender, the noodles were warn, the chicken somewhere between cold and lukewarm. Good flavor, I basically got one drumstick that was really hard to eat with the bone in. I am glad I was not hungry. No line at 11am, the place has the ambiance of a fast food restaurant with an ordering kiosk, and a super annoying bell they ring when an order is ready. One ding when it is ready and if you are not getting your food within seconds (not kidding) they go into rapid ding mode, which means when you eat there it will ding all the time. Definitely not worth the trip
4
It's located on the 1st floor of Chinatown Complex (a wet market), about 400m from Chinatown MTR station (exit A). Couldn't believe my eyes when saw the prices (1st photo). The chicken was one of the best tasted. The queue was about 20 minutes. 14 people lunch there for SGD$54 and left with full tummy. Must come again!
2
I visit there with long Q. I though the dish so nice but it was not. Food avarage, not fresh. Quality equa to other food court in Singapore. Maybe it was located tourist place so it is crowded . Not recommend.
1
Michelin star?? Food was served cold. Chicken was bloody inside, got sick from the food. There are a lot of better local streetfood restaurants in Singapore. But it is cheap
3
Food quality is getting from bad to worst
The sauce is overpowering of 5 spice.
Could be due to the business expansion, just have no quality control. Service Staff is proud because of the "michealen star" status.
3
I’m sorry to say not living up to a Michelin star rating. I’ve had better street food. My girls enjoyed it and the place was packed so doing something right.
3
Waited in line for 45 minutes and was not wowed in the slightest by the chicken and rice. I had plenty of chicken and rice elsewhere that was better. If the line is short then go for it so you can say you did it but I would not recommend waiting more than 15 minutes for this
3
I Been to their Tai Seng outlet first and the chicken was meh but the bbq pork char siew was goodDecided to give it another chance at their original Michelin award winning outlet @ Chinatown... again the chicken is just average but the char siew was unique in terms of their cut and good flavour.I think they got their Michelin for their char siew cos seriously their chicken is average tasting.
3
We knew we’d have to queue and 30 minutes or so (as it turned out to be) was fine. The dining area is communal so be prepared to share a table. Alternatively, you can opt for a takeaway.The food was nothing to shout about. We asked for chicken breast meat only which they were ok with. Otherwise you’ll get whatever cut of chicken is next.I’ll be interested to see how long Mr Chan keeps his Michelin star. Beggars belief that he’s got one in the first place but hats off to him! At least he was in house which is often not the case once stars are awarded
3
It was walking distance from the hotel we stayed. We went early to Hawker Chan restaurant before the crowd so we did not need to wait long, already few tables occupied. I can say now we've tried the cheapest Michelin Star but honestly nothing to shout about the quality. We had the roasted pork, soya sauce chicken which was really tender and pork ribs all with noodles
4
You can tell that an eatery knows how to cook chicken when it serves up breast meat so tender that it's equivalent to thigh meat serve at other places. Not the best soya sauce chicken I have tasted but pretty close. The char siew was average though or else I would have given 5 stars
4
Food was not as excellent as expected but it was really good anyway. We loved the soya chicken rice very much. Price is cheaper than some other places. Service was a bit unfriendly and there was a long queue so it'd be better to reserve the food by using the machine
2
Definitely not worthy of its Michelin star in my opinion. Terrible service and food was cold. Avoid.
5
They have only few dishes available and they cook them very well. Service is very fast. I'm very glad I went there.
2
Too many people who go there to satisfy their curiosity. Chicken portion poor for the price paid for the basic dish. You get better value opposite, in the hawker centre upstairs .sauce too sweet for my liking. Nothing special... Really. Save your money and go to the hawker centre opposite and try any of the chicken rice stalls there. You will be pleasantly surprised.
1
Wonder what’s the criteria for getting a Michelin Star and what’s so overwhelming about it. If I have a choice in this review, I wouldn’t even give it a star. One of the stallholder’s attitude was terrible when I asked for ‘no bones” chicken. Good customer service should be one of the important components besides flavor.  My favourite Kampung Nasi was closed at that time, I decided to try the soya sauce chicken rice as the queue was not very long, about 10 or so people ahead of me. My mistake for not checking out the google reviews while waiting. Some had reviewed about bad service and the chickens served were not deboned. I took for granted too, as most chicken rice hawker stalls here are deboned. Was taken aback with the chopper’s reply in Mandarin : “no debone, do you still want”. ‘Already so cheap, you still want me to debone. Where can you find so cheap with debone” I replied, “Bedok”. She rebutted, “Then go there and buy, don’t buy from here”. Again, she asked, “do you want”. In that instant, should have walked away, but after waiting for so long, relunctantly, ‘I said yes’. I gave the packet to someone else, thus never get to try this poisonous “Michelin Star Soya Sauce Chicken Rice”. Quote from Edgar Cayce: "Edgar Cayce stated that even the most nutritious foods can turn to poison in the system if eaten while a person is in a negative frame of mind. Never eat when angry, worried or extremely tired."Likewise, if food is being prepared by unhappy beings, toxins go down the throat.Please food bloggers, reveiwers, stars award givers, when giving food reviews, awards, please only write/give to those with service oriented, good attitudes

Order the chicken leg piece (leg piece as a special request) with rice plus a side order of greens; grab a pineapple juice from the stall opposite: and you’re in for a fantastic (and seriously cheap) lunch. You can also do what the locals do, and go for the takeaway option on top of your order. Eat a plate now, then have some for later. Make sure you join the queue next to the juice stand (you can’t miss it - it’s the only long one), and don’t try to go to the front of the stall without queuing. There is always a queue until sold out (when disappointed people walk away). Consistent and tasty. Full of flavour. Simple. Enjoy
1
There was a long wait, but we didn't mind this, thinking that it would be worth it. It was NOT! The portions are very small and the meat (we had the pork ribs and roast pork) was dry. The worst thing was the noodles - they were stone COLD! How hard it is to cook noodles and serve them hot and fresh? Obviously, the hype from getting a Michelin star has gone to their heads and/or they cannot keep up with demand and need to cook huge portions of noodles ahead of time and put them aside to get cold and dry. The only food that was good was the "seasonal" vegetable dish, but at $5.00 for a very small portion, even that was not good value. Very disappointed
5
The line moves pretty fast. Seating is hard to come by but you learn to make friends.. or at least share a table. The chicken is perfectly marinated, and the noodles are everything I want in a noodle. lightly sauced, al dente, just perfection. And for the price? It's a win win. If you're hungry I would order two
4
This restaurant - sometimes known as Hawker Chan - already gets great patronage after receiving 1 star from Michelin for their soy sauce chicken. So, this review won't increase or dent their business.Actually, they have 2 places: their original hawker stall across the street on the second floor, #135 and this newly open air conditioned restaurant at 78 Smith Street.A group of 4 of us visited 78 on a rainy Tuesday afternoon. Because of the rain, the lines had disappeared, but the foodies were still snapping away pictures.The chicken is ok, the price is unbelievable.The price were double what they charge at their hawker stand across the street, but still worth the value. I recommend going before the lunchtime crowd arrives, mid-afternoon
4
Since seeing this place prior to the Michelin star I wanted to try it. Once it obtained the star the want became a must.First of all, there are 2 stores, one is inside the Chinatown food complex. This is one of the 38 Michelin star restaurants in Singapore (at nov 2017). The other opposite the complex, does not technically have the star. The stall opens at 10.30am and on the Friday morning when I went, the line began at 10am. At 1030 when I arrived it was already 15 deep,We tried the chicken & rice. Chicken & noodles. Siu yuk with rice.The food was very reasonably priced. But when talking Michelin star, price should not be a consideration. However for the price, yes the food is excellent! I don't know if I have ever had a better meal for the price. Especially the pork, which I actually preferred to the chicken.It is a must try if in Singapore, the line moves fairly quickly, so don't be afraid to join it.Does this place deserve a Michelin star?, in my humble opinion, no. Does this place serve good food?, yes it does. Would I go back?, definitely. Now that it has a Michelin star, it must be compared to restaurants with the same rating. I have eaten at multiple Michelin Star restaurants, in France and UK. Does this food compare to any of those?, no. It is one of the best stalls in the Chinatown Food Complex, so chope a table, get in line and try the best soya sauce chicken in china town
5
This place serves awesome Soya Chicken! The wait around noon was about 30 minutes, and it was totally worth it! The Soya chicken rice dish was so extremely good, and I wanted more! For S$3.80, one got to try a Michelin rated dish, and that’s just amazing! I added S$3 pork belly to my plate, and it just brought the whole experience to a whole new level! I loved every single bite of my food! Now I want more!
5
We had to wait for 30 minutes, the food is quite cheap, the serving is OK.
Chicken is really tasty, so better take two or more portions to enjoy.
4
If yu would queue 45 mins average on weekends for chicken, this is the stall to do it. Succulent chicken pieces well done, best with a bowl of steamed rice or two.
5
Hawker Chan is a expansion outlet of the original stall in the food hall market.
We ordered the Soya Sauce chicken.
It came quickly and we all enjoyed our Michelin 1 star meal.
1
MY friend has intro me must try chicken rice in Singapore but after a long queue we are soo excited to try the food but wefeel that is jus normal and the pork is tooo hard to chew.the food is jus normal but price reasonable maybe too many nice food in malaysia that why i feel this is jus normal.
3
Firstly the service was fantastic - obviously a very busy store and the turn around time was incredible and ordering was easy given the very limited menu options The food - my dish was wonderful, the flavour of the sauce and the chicken was fantastic; the port was also delicious....however it is very much luck of the draw as to which part of the chicken you end up with. My friend ended up with a lot of bone and connective tissue with maybe half the meat I had For $3 a dish, it's easy enough to order multiple I suppos
1
Everything about this place is sub standard, especially the cashier’s attitude towards customers. There was some argument between 2 staff members behind the cashier. It went on for more than 5 minutes. So imagine the mood that led to the foul service. The staff here only helped by spoiling Hawker Chan’s good name. The food is not as nice as the original stall in the Hawker Centre. Maybe the bad service already left a bad taste in my mouth so whatever I ate just tasted mediocre. I will not visit this place again.
3
Had to taste this highly rated street food to see if it matched other m star restaurants - was a bit disappointed to be honest. The food wasn't bad it just was underwhelming compared to many other dishes tried in the same street. I wouldn't recommend
5
We found in internet that they serve here very good chicken and rice dishes (got michelin 1 star). We weren't disappointed. It was in a Saturday and only 2 people were in the queue. We also ordered vegetarian dishes and everything was delicious. We can only recommend it.
2
Went on a Saturday 3 pm. Rude, unnecessary loud, (Malaysian?) young counter girl taking orders. Chicken noodle was without a bowl of soup which is the norm here in Singapore. Chicken was alright, good, NOT amazing. Noodle was actually cold and dry on the top - a sign that it has been pre-cooked long ago. Long wait of about 25 min at 3pm. Not cheap at $4.80. Noisy restaurant. Just wanna finish the food quickly and leave. Will not go back and do not recommend
1
Bad food, bad service. Heavily monetized after receiving michelin star. Full of chicken bones. When asked if deboning, you will be outright rejected. Just go for any hawker stall in Singapore and eat, they probably taste the same or better, definitely cheaper and free deboning services elsewhere.
5
Wow, I am definitely a big fan of the chicken and rice here and for the price you cant get much better of a meal anywhere! We came just as they opened so no line placed our order and had some amazing chicken!
4
Very busy. Bit like a canteen style- queue up outside to be let inside to queue to pay, collect a receipt and they alert you when your order is done. Bit difficult to find seats. Food tasted really good but was a bit cold
3
The attention was very fast, there was not to many people, we had lunch later than the usual hour in Singapore (12PM).
The chicken was good but too much bone in my opinion.
For a onetime only.
3
We decided to go there for the Estrella Michelin, of course. The chicken was really good, but the rice had a sauce that I didn't like. The noodles were ok. The price causes laughter: super cheap, you can have lunch for less than 5$.
5
Tasty and not expensive. Especially since this is the restaurant that got the star of the mind. We liked!
4
Queue was significantly shorter compared to when it first obtained the Michelin status.The soya chicken is done fantastically. Very tender, even the breast meat taste good!Best to go along with the noodles. Very smooth and tasty!2 pax can easily finish half a chicken
1
We were really looking forward to trying a Michelin starred chicken rice. Having lived in Singapore a number of years ago, we have eaten a lot of chicken rice. This was probably one of the worst we've ever had. Chicken was undercooked and tasteless, the rice had no flavour and there were none of the yummy accompanying dips like grated ginger or chili sauce. The only saving grace was that we arrived at about 11 so no queues, and it wasn't overly expensive. But if you want to eat good chicken rice, don't go there.
5
Yes it is busy, and yes Asian food has bones in it. But this was an incredible experience. The food was great, line up out the door at 10am but only took ten minutes to get good. I recommend anyone traveling to Singapore that enjoys greater variety other than 'steak and chips' to try this place
1
We visited Liao Fan, of course, due to the Michelin star. So the expectations were slightly higher than when visiting ordinary Hawkers Center. Unfortunately the visit was disappointment. The place was crowded and noisy. And the food was even worse. Chicken contained mostly bones. And this is supposed to be a chicken place. Is this a joke, which I just don't understand ? Anyway, this puts also some suspect on Le Guide Michelin, which so far has been my trusted guide to find interesting restaurants.
1
My partner and I were absolutely shocked as to how this could be a Michelin star experienceFirstly, the girl who took our order was nothing but rude. We had already decided what we wanted when we got to the counter and wasted no time relaying our order to her, but she seemed absolutely exasperated by the 5 seconds it took us to get the correct notes together to pay. But this was nothing compared to the atrocity that followed This meal was single handily the worst we've ever been served. Not only was the chicken and noodles stone cold - the noodles were also stodgy and dry on top, like they had been sitting around on the plate for quite some time The chicken was completely inedible The serve was completely bone and sinew and what little meat was very under cooked - there was a mass of blood on the middle of the cut as well.The skin was also slimy. Although I am not familiar with how this meal should be cooked, I feel it should not have looked like this. My partner had a slightly better cut of chicken, although also littered with bone, that I actually cracked a tooth on. Quickly turning the cheapest Michelin stared meal into quite a costly one!!All I can say is get there around 4pm if you wish to avoid a line - we only waited a few minutes, if you want to test your luck and see if your meal turns out better/edible As a side note, both my partner and I have been quite ill since this meal

Review by Dr Sim. Very good Soya Sauce Chicken. Chicken appeared to be slightly under cooked. Perhaps it is the style. Chilli was good. Queue is usually long unless you pick the right time. Recommend that Tourists buy back to the hotel. Michelin recognised. Regards DrSim00

Michelin should be ashamed of themselves by granting this place a star. Even in regards to the world's cheapest Michelin-starred meal, you get what you pay for. The Soya Sauce Chicken was all bone, skin and fat, with very little meat. The only things I found decent were the condiments and the soy sauce drippings on the bottom of the plate. I tried to grasp the greatness this dish was known for, and it fell flat for me.Though, it was amusing to witness the tourists there instagramming and raving about the glorified dish. Sheep will be sheep, I suppose.I quickly got out of there to hail a taxi, and the driver laughed when I told him about my experience at Hawker Chan. He responded that even the place upstairs has better food, and I believe it.https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d12431317-r524222251-Liao_Fan_Hong_Kong_Soya_Sauce_Chicken_Rice_Noodle-Singapore.html

We initially wanted to go to the original stall in Chinatown Complex, but unfortunately it was closed for a few days during our visit. So we settled at its branch (an air-conditioned restaurant) which was just across the street. The queue was bearable and service was quick. We had Soya Sauce Chicken Drumstick with Wantan Noodles, BBQ & Roasted Pork with Dry Hor Fun, and bean sprouts. All these cost us S$16.30. The Soya Sauce Chicken tasted heavenly and perfectly executed! So juicy, tender, and flavourful! However, we think that was the only dish worth mentioning as the remaining ones were just mediocre. We hope we will be able to visit the original stall when we return to Singapore soon! I guess we will only order the Soya Sauce Chicken Rice / Noodles for the next visit, after all, that's what it is famous for!

try to eat here for breakfast.the stall open at 10, i came at 9.30 so no queue.i try the noodle, rice, and extra pork platters.first try the noodle was wow, it's good. but cold. i don't know why but it was cold.overall, good noodle. don't order rice. order extra bbq combination.spend $40 for 2 perso

Due the Michelin one star hawker award, decided to try it on a weekday since it would not be too crowded. We have to order from a counter like fast food restaurant, price is norm and not expensive. We have ordered half soya chicken and vegetable to go with it. The soya chicken is juicy and tender, very nice with the sauce and not salty at all. Highly recommended
5
There is not a lot to say when you eat Michelin food for 20$... When Michelin guide came to Singapore, they awarded Hawker Chan's food stall with 1 star. Since then he had to move to a larger location to accomodate the huge crowd, and the plave is indeed crowded, but he has not raised the prices a bit. His signs read "the cheapest Michelin food", and it is indeed a deliciously good food. Are we all influenced by that Star? Maybe. Would I give 5/5 if he did not have that Star? Who cares, the food is mouth watering and cheap. Just go and queu
2
Wanted to check out what the fuss was all about the cheapest michelin star restaurant in the world. Not sure if Michelin ask for shares in the retaurant before they hand over a star or the assessors have got a different palate. The portion was smaller than a happy meal at McDonald. Meal was cold and tasteless. It was a very disappointing experience. Wouldn't cross the road for it let alone fly to Singapore for it. Much better food outside chinatown or cbd, where the hawkers rely only on locals
5
This place is a must visit when in Singapore. We wanted to try the famous soya chicken at the original hawker food stand, but sadly it was closed for the week. Luckily, the restaurant was open. We heard the lines get really long so we got there shortly after 10am, and there were only 4-6 people in the line. We had the best soya chicken we've ever had.
5
Hawker Chan opened another restaurant across the street which I'm sure is good too, but it's the stall on the second floor of Chinatown complex that you're looking for. I was lucky and queued for only 30min for a weekday lunch. The portions are standard, so I added the pork belly and it was only about $3.50 in total. Chicken was tender and the skin was crispy. The sauce was just rightly sweet, with a hint of sourness. The pork belly was crackling crispy too with tender meat. Overall, a well deserved michelin star imho
5
This place was on the 'to-do' list of food to have in Singapore. The only store to have a long queue. It moves quite fast. Quick service, had both the rice & noodle version. Food is fresh and tasty. Definitely worth the trip.
2
Staffs are not friendly and kitchen staffs looks unhappy.... Poor attitude. Management need to look into it.....
5
Ok, we queued for a while to order and then waited for a table. Service was what you would expect in a takeaway restaurant but ... chicken and rice was great, pork 3 ways was amazing. This place just seems to be a simple eatery dealing with high demand but the food is as good as it gets. Don't expect high class eating - deal with the crowd, order more than you may want and then enjoy your meal
4
First, it is not a place you saw on that famous viral video anymore. It has changed. Master chef does not serve food by himself, it is now handled by many workers. I think they even have moved. Second, the food is good. Sauce is indeed delicious, and any meal you choose will be done just right. Third, they may have expanded and became too commercial, but it helped to reduce waiting times. Still, you can expect to queue for about 20 mins after 15:00, or for about 40-50 mins during lunch times. Recommend to try

We sought this place out purely on the basis of it having a Michelin star. Ordinarily a star is associated with great ambience, service and presentation as well as exceptional food. But given this is essentially street food, we could forgive the canteen feel and McDonald's-style ordering system. This place must have earned its star purely through amazing food right? Apparently not. We ordered a variety of meats, rice and noodles, which ranged from lukewarm to stone cold. Taste-wise the most appropriate word I can think of is 'alright' - not terrible,not great, just bog standard fayre you can find in countless other eateries. Maybe our sense of disappointment was heightened due to a naive expectation of Michelin star quality food at street food prices. To me, a star should represent that an establishment is part of an exclusive club, a badge of honour awarded only to the very best of the best. If this place represents the standard required for qualification, half the world's restaurants would have a star and the whole thing would be meaningless. So in summary, if you're thinking of joining the queue with expectations of some kind of Michelin-starred taste sensation, don't bother, you'll only be left disappointed.

Recently came to check this place out after all of the hype. It was very good. We waited in line for about an hour and ten minutes. Servings were good, and the chicken was delightful. I am not sure it 100% lived up to the Michelin hype, but I certainly had nothing to complain about
5
It was really fun queuing with my sister to enjoy the chicken rice and hor fun from this stall. The serving was really generous and the taste was simply brilliant! However the most important thing is I enjoyed it so much because I was enjoying it with my sister and thus it was really fun, enjoyable and a great lunch!

I can't believe waiting for ages to be served a sloppy, cold, bland meal is considered to be an experience deserving of accolades. The preparation of the food itself is so lazy, everything was cold and all the meat was full of bone. I couldn't believe how long we had to wait for our crappy meal to be thrown together on a plate. If it had been hot and nicely presented I would understand! My partner and I have been ill since, no surprise!!! What a let down.

Review by Dr Sim. Best Soya Chicken in Singapore. At first I was a bit skeptical, but the soya chicken was beyond my expectation. Michelin Star 1 is correct. Lousy ambience. Tourists should try. Ridiculously long queues. Best to buy take-aways and eat in your own air-conditioned home. Price is reasonable but more expensive than normal. I would love to eat again but I hate the queue. Regard Dr Si

This establishment received a michelin star hence it beacame an instant hit to the locals and foreigners. The price is (still) affordable compared to the average cost of dining in Singapore. Try to avoid going here during peak hours as the end of the queue can circle the moon twice
2
Poor or actually rude staff, the signature dish was not worth it, though it was cheap. Just go to one of the other places around, and there are many.
5
I don't understand why people are complaining about this food stall. Get rid of that Michelin-star thingy, everything here is great and authentic!
1
I was really excited to give this a try, however it really was not good and highly disappointing. It bordered on inedible and was one of the worst meals I've had in a long time.
1
Food was overated and taste nothing special. The staffs were rude and unfriendly. Forget to order one more dish and asked to queue all over again.
3
There is one more listing in Tripadvisor for the same restaurant listed under Hong Kong Soya Sauce Chicken rice and noodles. This place is crowded like crazy the reason being its recent won recognition from Michellin. Food is very cheap S$4-5 for a dish. Value for money is great. Food tastes like any other hawker stall in Singapore. One has to wait for at least 20-25 minutes at lunch time before your order is ready. Self service and be prepared to share your table with others. Strangely the food is cold
4
Honestly, this place does not deserve a Michelin star. It is far away from what you would expect from such a place. That being said, this place offers the best soy sauce I've ever tasted! The place is an authentic hawker stall and the food tastes great. It's also really cheap. I had the classic chicken and rice with soy sauce and paid 3,8 Singapore dollars. Great value and well worth the visit
3
The restaurant was easy to find, located right in the center of Chinatown, brand new shop with clean and bright interior. Implement self ordering kiosk which allow faster moving of queue, everything is self service for this restaurant. However, sorry to say that the chicken rice is overrated, nothing special to me. The chicken rice stall next to my house serves better chicken rice. Recommend to get the char siew noodle instead of chicken rice, noodle was good though. Overall, it is a very touristy restaurant but reasonable cheap-eats in Singapore
4
It is difficult to rate a restaurant that has been awarded a Michelin star, even if we are talking about a hawker stall. Obviously this produces a bias, usually positive but at times also negative. Personally, I liked the pork with soya sauce more than the famous chicken, but by all means having the chance to eat such quality food at that price (less than 5 euro each plate) is certainly worth it
4
米其林一星餐厅。了凡传统香港油鸡饭面，味道好！做为小贩试的饭厅来说环境算一流了！服务也不错，价格又便宜，只是地点有点怪。Michelin one star restaurant located is a strange location. Traditional Hong Kong soya sauce chicken rice/noodles taste pretty good. This is suppose to be a hawker center style type of restaurant but the environment is super nice as a hawker! Service level is pretty good too
3
We went to the actual hawker stall in the Chinatown complex, not the restaurant across the street. There was about a 1/2 hour line and were able to order our meals - soya sauce chicken and rice and pork and rice - for about $5USD. It was fine - it was a good, cheap meal, food stall meal, but having dined at other Michelin star restaurants, I didn't see what was so "Michelin star" about it. But definitely worth checking out
3
Dishes were very cheap and tasty. We both had the soja chicken with is the famous dish. Chicken was cold. Lots of people and noisy. Waiting time for sure. Self service.
1
Really Cold dishes + no napkins service + bad customer service. Much better street food at many different locations in town. No need to come here on purpose.
4
This hawker is in the Michelin guide and I understand why! Greeeeeat food! It was a bit hard to find since we found two different addresses when we searched it but once we found it it was definitely worth the trouble! It's not the nicest place to sit and eat, but then again it's a hawker, so what can you expect? It's the cheapest Michelin meal in the world, and I'd definitely recommend it!
1
We had a one day layover in Singapore and Number 1 on our list of things to do was to experience a Michelin starred meal at this hawker stall. There were only 5 people in line ahead of us, so that part was good. The order was taken swiftly and we then took a seat where we could watch the orders being placed on the counter for pickup.Then we waited...and waited. We watched meals being put on the counter for pickup, but our number was not called. We waited some more. Finally our number is called! Our 3 meals looked amazing and we just couldn't wait to dig in. Imagine our surprise when all 3 meals were cold!!! The flavor was definitely there, but since the dishes were all room temperature, it was hard to enjoy them. What a huge waste of time on a very short visit to Singapore.They should have their Michelin star revoked
3
It might be because I was expecting something amazing from a one-star michelin restaurant, but I was quite disappointed. The food was only a little better compared with other chicken rice places, although the price was also cheap. The chicken is a little softer and the skin is really good but the dish was cold. The vegetable dish was nice and savory, though, and we really enjoyed the cold flower tea.We went on a Thursday at 6.30 PM, the queue was not bad, I queued for less than 15 minutes, and the food came out in less than 5 minutes. It was difficult to find a seat, and somehow with so many people waiting for a seat, a lot of people used extra seats for their bags. I probably won't come back, but it was worth trying the cheapest michelin star restaurant, though
3
Chicken and pork was nice and flavoursome. Noodles were prepped so long ago and played that they had welded together and were stone cold.The hawker stall may be good but this place wouldn't win any prizes at all. The saving grace was our meal cost us about 10 bucks each which is cheap to say you have eaten Michelin â€¢
4
...Brought us here. After queueing for 20 minutes we finally got the prized plates with Michelin star rated chicken rice. It was very good chicken rice according to my wife who is an expert from Penang. It was fun and we enjoyed the meal. Was it good food - yes! Did it blow my mind - not really.
5
Went here for lunch. I opted for the original location in the Chinatown Food Complex and not the restaurant as such. So this hawker stall has one star in the Michelin guide - and it is the cheapest one star lunch on the planet for Sing $2.50. The star and the price draws a crowd so be prepared to wait. My wait was one hour. Was it worth the wait? Absolutely- this was by far the best chicken I ever had - so succulent and moist - full of flavor - simply incredible.
4
I have to give this restaurant 4 stars. It is the cheapest place to buy "Michelin star" food and it was good, just underwhelming. Maybe my western palate isn't used to eastern food and maybe can't discern what is meant to be so special about this? Who knows.It's OK, still glad I went
2
Very surprised with the end result from a place recommended so frequently, and with the Michelin star.The reality was options on the menu reduced down to just a few available items, cold food, with poor cuts of meat.There are so many superior options within the area. What a shame
3
Expensive and overrated. Tried their chicken and find it below average. Not sure about their BBQ pork and roasted pork.
1
I have read many good reviews about this restaurant that earn a michelen star and i decide to visit it. All the place was dirty and crowded.the food was under average.was cold and almost disgusting. Maybe was good in the past but now is absolutery a bad experience. Better go to eat at the hawker stall at the same road smith street
5
We went here after seeing it on Facebook before our holiday to Singapore. We were staying in Chinatown and it was literally around the corner. We would have gone far out of our way to eat here though - the food was really good. And only cost us around S$10 each with a drink. The queue wasn't too bad when we went - we had to queue out the door but the queue moved fairly quickly. And the wait after ordering wasn't too long. I would go back
4
A taxi driver recommended the restaurant and mentioned the Michelin star so we had to try it! The chicken in the signature dish "Soya Sauce Chicken Rice" was super tender, the soya sauce not so great (but that is a matter of taste). The other dishes of pork and vegetables were good but you can get them in other similar style restaurants. It does have a bit of a "fast food" tinge to it but I suppose that is the way to deal with the queues, otherwise people would have been waiting so long for the food
2
Pardon me ... but I seriously have given this stall a couple of chances but after a few encounters, enough is enough!! Just to give a bit of history about this Soya Sauce Chicken stall. They started in Chinatown in the hawker centre stall. The Original Stall is still in the hawker centre apparently managed by his wife. There is always long Q even till today. I would say for the price and taste, they are quite good. But for the kind of attitude and customer service you get after queuing for more than 1 hour just to buy that few plates or few packets of Soya Sauce chicken rice or noodles, its totally not worth it. The attitude of the lady boss sucks and she is always very rude and unfriendly. I have a few encounters and my mum also had quite a few encounters too. She will literally snatched the money or notes from us when we asked her how much was our purchased. She will rudely tell you in a manner eg. "give me your money, give me your money"!! In this case, does it mean that every customer is subjected to her "mercy" and we were not sure how much each packet / plates of rice or noodles costs as she will not answer you when you asked her how much it costs and I would not take for granted that there might be calculations error at times too since the queue is always long! Such detestable service we get from this stall. We will not return every to patronise from this stall again
4
Most tourists may not be aware that there are actually 2 locations of this Michelin star food .One is a shophouse along the main road of Smith Street(no 78), in an airconditioned premise. You can't miss this place - a banner proclaiming "the Cheapest Michelin Star Eatery" stares at you.The humble Original stall (in a more authentic hawker atmosphere) is just directly across the road - on the 2nd floor of Chinatown Complex . Go up the escalator to the 2nd floor hawker (food) centre, turn right & you see a long queue right at the end ( that is the stall).The prices overall are cheaper at the Original stall.The chicken still tasted very good, at the Original stall.Note both locations are closed on Wednesday
4
We waited in line for more than an hour. They had run out of all their pork and other offerings when we were there. Their famous chicken was good but there was nothing very special about it. Their food is very cheap and yes, cheaper than other stalls there but I don't think it deserves a Michelin Star
3
After a deal with an investor to leverage the brand name and one Michelin star power to make some serious money, Liao Fan moved out of the crowded and dingy hawker food court on the 2nd floor of People's Park and moved into a much bigger McDonald Super Store size premise nearby with all the modern fast food trappings. I did not see the original owner behind the kitchen when I was there. The taste of roast chicken? The meat is still tender but the warmth is gone. The BBQ pork, roast pork etc are nothing special at all. Price wise, probably gone up 50% if not more. The queue is still long at lunch time so better show up before 11:30 to avoid the long wait. Would I go there again? No lah. For the lack of personal touch. It is just another fast food joint
3
Tried the famous soya chicken, mixed plate of roasted pork and char siew, beansprouts and Hong Kong Choy Sum.All in came to Sgd 28 of which the 1/2 soya chicken costs Sgd 13/-.I was told by one of my guests that the price of 1/2 soya chicken is much cheaper than any hawker stalls!! And certainly much much cheaper than some fancy pretentious Korean Nana spicy Chicken.On that score it is worth eating the soya chicken but it is not as tasty and succulent/tender as I would have expected from a restaurant with a Bib Gourmand mention. I have certainly tasted much better and more tender soya chicken.The roasted pork and char siew were pedestrian. The preparation of which seems lacking in passion.The veges were standard fares and nothing special.Soya chicken: 3/5Roast pork, char siew: 2.5/
5
For a one star Michelin-standard dish, the price is unbeatable. You can have a good meal for below $8 including drinks. Highly recommended, though I heard that his original stall at the Chinatown hawker center still taste a lot better. I do find that the food is not as warm as I like likely due to the open busy kitchen but the roast pork belly and soy sauce chicken are still delicious. Will try the noodles next time.
4
Love their wan tan noodle with char siew!!! Soy sauce chicken taste good too!!! Highly recommended!!!
4
Lucky enough when I went, only took me 5 minutes waiting time, easy to order, but portion size was really small, but food was good, was great experience to try out a Michilin star restaurant, and paying under $10 for a meal.
3
Probably mentioned also earlier, but not 'just chicken rice'... also pork. So, a "no-go" for people seeking Halal dishes. Was so dissapointed that I even went inside to ask; "halal?" "No halal, no halal"
5
We were recommended to this place by a couple of other tourists and we were glad we took their advice. We went for lunch. Make sure you get there early as the place fills up quick and you could be waiting a while.The food was cheap and very tasty. It's a simple menu but when the food is that tasty you dont need much. Make sure you have the crispy pork, yum yum yum..
4
I was sent a link - CNN Travel (Singapore offers the world's cheapest Michelin-starred meal), so I had to try it out, since I am visiting Singapore.Food was delicious. My small plate of soya sauce chicken with noodles, and a side dish of BBQ pork ribs - just over S$7.00. After I ordered and received my number, I had to wait about 20 minutes for my number to come up. The place was packed and was a classic human 'gridlock' - people with food have trouble getting a seat, while people that came as a group, were seated waiting for their numbers to be called.I was very fortunate, as after I picked up my food, I spotted someone finishing up, so I made a bee-line to wait for him.Would I go back? Unlikely, as I do not think it is worth the hassle and there are many good places to eat in Singapore. I am glad to have experienced the delicious soya sauce chicken
5
Obviously everyone wants to dine in the cheapest Michelin star restaurant in the world. We thought we would end up waiting in line for hours but we were lucky enough to not wait more than 15 minutes. The rice and noodles with both chicken and pork are just delicious. They are literally cooked to perfection and they cost you peanuts!!! It was so good we decided to go back again before leaving Singapore
5
After hearing hawker Chan and his chicken rice being the first in the world to be awarded Michelin freaking Star, i was surprised and excited at the same time that finally the hawker food can be grade the same with high grade fine dining standards. Unfortunately i post this review for the sake of letting others know the great chicken rice recognized by Michelin Star. I still have not been there before but i will one day and even if i need to queue 2 hours, i do not have a problem with that. Hawker Chan not just made Singapore proud but Ipoh Mali people in Malaysia more prouder. Haha
4
First time tried and packed back home for dinner from newly opened branch at Toa Payoh Central. Queue was fast and orderly with a given number for collection. I have ordered soya chicken rice and a pack of bean sprouts that cost $3.80 and $3.00 respectively. Taste is good and unpretentious. Will go for other delights in future
4
I had two dishes, chicken & rice and chicken & noodles. It costed 4,5 s$, and it was more than enough for one. The food was really delicious, the noodle dish had too much soy sauce in my opinion. I went there 11 am and I had to queue for more than an hour, the only negative thing in the place
5
For the price you can't go wrong. Try going slightly outside of the usual lunch hours for a shorter wait. I went at 11 and it was about a 45 minute wait, not unpleasant. I had chicken, noodles and ribs all of which were fantastic. Well worth visiting, the whole market is fantastic
5
Here is really very tasty chicken. Definitely the best in Chinatown. But I prefer with a noodles. Be careful chicken could be finished at 1p.m. And stroll will be close. Huge line in it. Highly recommend!
3
The price is cheap and long queue of customers . I a bit disappointed with the food in view of not enough hot to taste.
3
I have better chicken rice in Singapore, but my taste might be different. queue is quite long, order through the computer machine. Price is decent. Do come early, unless you want to queue
2
We had been going to Chan's in the China Town Hawkers Centre for years, where he produced his delicious popular succulent tasty signature Hong Kong style Soya Chicken. The old adage.. 'where you see a long queue at a food establishment in Singapore join it !' Chan soon attracted a well deserved Michelin star .. the queues got longer as Michelin foodies and tourists join in .. The new modern McDonald's style fast food dine-in with electronic ordering and modern white clinical bland surroundings takes away much of the experience.. and nostalgia .. but the food is still good and they attract a crowd of curious tourists but there is no atmosphere as you wait for your order number to appear on the screen, pick up your tray and find a free table
5
After reading the reviews we decided to go to the original hawker stall, queued for about thirty to forty minutes. To be honest the wait went fast, chatting to the regular locals and tourists. After much debate we ordered half soya chicken each, side of noodles and a BBQ pork. All food was super tasty, the chicken was so juicy and full of flavour, we were in food heaven. It was a hot humid 34 degrees, but plenty of tables were available under the many fans they have in the food hall. You won't regret doing it like the locals, an experience to savour
4
To get a decent meal for a small price can sometimes prove difficult, but to leave this place full and content for roughly S$20 for two people was easily achieved.The biggest issue my daughter and I had was that they'd sold out of all the pork and char-siew offerings by the time we got to order :(The service was perfunctory and fairly fast, the line moved slowly but didn't stop. Food was served quite quickly given the number of diners and the flavor and quality was top notch
3
I couldn't find in TripAdvisor the Original Hawker location (which my review is about that's actually located in the Hawker Venter in front). This store is more of a fast food chain from the same Chef. Well getting to the matter I cued for 45 minutes. The food itself wasn't bad but not extraordinary nor Michelin star level. It was a great meal for pennies on the dollar for sure. The produce itself wasn't very good quality which I guessed affected the end result and hence my review but it was amazingly cooked.
4
Food is very good, especially chicken. Really short line at 12m. Maybe it was better before the Michelin star. It now has very high air conditioning, so good is cold when you finally get to eating it.Really difficult to criticize because it is so inexpensive..
5
My friend bought half a soya sauce chicken for me . I ate the chicken 9h later after work and this is my review -: The meat was juicy and succulent, and even the breast part was so tender. There is a good balance fats and leaner meat. The smokey flavour permeated through the bones to the core .It has enough saltiness at the essential parts.The sauce is fragrant without being overly salty. The Chilli is spicy enough for my liking. I read on reviews that there is relatively cheap. Verdict : My Son and I are going to the eatery to eat next week !I am so thankful to my friend for making the effort to buy this delicious treat for me ! Xie Xie, Shar !
5
You can find heaven for less cost than a meal at McDonalds. I was skeptical that Chicken and Rice or the other meat options and noodles would be memorable. But, I was wrong. Customers order from an automated kiosk, pick up there order from a bustling counter and eat at clean, but packed, tables in the dining area. The chicken was flavorful and delicious. The ribs were quite tasty and I loved the noodles as much as the rice. The restaurant story and reviews are framed on the wall, but I donâ€™t need a fancy-pants review to tell me what good food they have. GO HERE AND EAT. It is delicious, fast and a signature experience in the Hawker (market).
3
Was there in October. We ordered the infamous chicken, noodle and meat platter. But the meat are all cold. Noodle is chewy but the sauce is just average. Can't find reason to come back
3
The food was goodish, but not wow. I was expecting something special, very tasty, for a Michelin Star place, but I ate better in the market next to my hotel.

"The cheapest Michelin starred meal" screams across prominently displayed signage at this eatery, a stone's throw from the Chinatown complex hawker stall (sadly not open on the day I went to check it out). The 78 Smith outlet is one of 3 'branches' that came from this stall. Usually branches mean central kitchen food, industrialized order and pick up system and little service. All true, but the air-conditioned outlet dished out soya chicken, char-xiao and springy noodles that punched well above my expectations of central kitchen fare. First, forget the rice, go for the noodles. They are springy but not so much that you struggle to break up the noodles with each bite. So this is already superior to Mak's Noodles, a Hong Kong import at Orchard Centerpoint. The Soya Chicken is good but not earth shattering. I noticed that when I ordered an extra side of chicken, the meat is better than the chicken that comes with a regular order of chicken with noodles. So, order neat noodles without chicken and order chicken separately. Third, the char xiao is surprisingly the best I have had in a long while. Not only it is optimal in lean vs fat portion, it is slightly charred on the sides that most places just don't do anymore. All told, an excellent experience for a chinatown legend. Keep up the standards and never sacrifice quality and consistency for short term gain

Singapores most famous 'street food stall' due to its recent acquisition of a Michellin star, Hong Kong Soya Sauce Chicken Rice and Noodle has become as much of a tourist attraction as it has a genuine restaurant. My partner and I navigated the madness for a meal in a recent trip to Singapore. Unfortunately I think it's fame has become it's undoing. As you would expect the wait is significant (expect half an hour). The store is always packed and the orders are propelled out by a cashier who seems to press the order ready bell in a way that is consistent with a epileptic seizure.The taste of the food was good and the price wasn't ridiculous (29SD for 2 drinks, 3 meals) but it became obvious to me this is no longer a 'small street stall'. I think since they have acquired the star the owner is cashing in. As a result food is now prepared by a team of half a dozen cooks and seems to be cooked in mass to keep up with the high demand. As a consequence of this our meals were freezing cold, almost like they had been pre-prepared earlier in the day and left out on the bench too long.I wouldn't go back
5
We have checked the free/busy times on google maps in order to avoid the heavy crowds and this really paid off! After queuing for 5 minutes we managed to get some quite spectacular fried pork with rice and all I can say is that: kudos to the chef
4
This is a review of the food stall #02-127 in the Chinatown Complex - I understand that the sit-down place across the street on 78 Smith Street is exactly the same food.I was attracted by the Michelin rating as I have been to many starred places before. I like the idea that Michelin has looked at streetfood in Singapore and HongKong as deserving full recognition for their culinary variety and excellence and their contribution to a dynamic, living culture. What I found at the stall, after the obligatory wait (~50 minutes from 11:15 am on a weekday) was a very good chicken dish, no doubt about it; and "normal" rice sprinkled with thick soy sauce. I did not try the noodles. But this level of deliciousness can be found in many other places that are not on Michelin's radar. And the experience was not such that I would absolutely need to go back - for me, the food did not rise to "craving" level. So by all means, use the Michelin's pre-screening as a guide to filter out from the hundreds of delectable food choices nearby. But don't expect an out-of-this-world experience that one would normally associate with a Michelin star.Of note is the unpretentious fresh juice stand across from the Hong Kong Soy Sauce stall - I had two great juices there
4
We (family and friends) decided to try this many months after the Michelin Star hype to avoid the crazy lines. Good food is better when you don't have to wait in line for hours. Headed down on a weekday evening and standing in line took only 15 min. If you love noodles and super tender chicken, this will be a "love at first bite" experience. We weren't disappointed at all! Will definitely be back! Noodles are so good you can eat them on their own, good they sell just the noodles as a separate dish
5
There is another listing here in Tripadvisor on this restaurant. However, the address in that listing is referring to the first air-conditioned outlet and not to the original hawker stall which still exists! That listing's reviews gives a confusing view about Liao Fan. This new listing is hopefully to clarify about Liao Fan and hopes to give a genuine thread of reviews on the original hawker stall and not on the air-conditioned outlet/s.Once again, the original hawker stall still exists! It's located in the Chinatown Complex, level 2, where all the food stalls are located.Liao Fan then went on to open a couple of air-conditioned outlets, with the first outlet on 78 Smith Street, which is the address stated on the other Listing in tripadvisor.The hawker stall is likely the one with the super long queue. I arrived at 11.30am on a week day and ended up waiting 1 hour 40 mins. I have visited two air-conditioned outlets - the longest I had to wait was 40 mins.The quality is the same between this hawker stall and the air-conditioned outlets except that prices at the hawker stall is almost HALF that of the air-conditioned outlets!Also, I did notice that the hawker stall didn't give much of the sauce so the noodles tended to be slightly dry.The queue here at the hawker stall is very tricky. The queueing line starts a few metres away from the stall so customers will easily miss the starting line. Once you notice the line, you will then be surprised to see the long queue in that line! While queueing, you can see so many first-timers walking straight up to the stall and wanting to place their order. The server (likely to be wife of the master cook) will then point them to the line and then the first timer looks back at the line and you will notice their shocked expressions.Liao Fan's soya sauce chicken is the real deal. You will love it! The roast pork and barbecue pork (char siu) are very good too BUT you can find similarly good ones in many other food stalls. I have not tried the rice as I prefer noodles. Noodles here are good quality ones with a nice bite to it. Again, not enough of the sweet sauce. I ordered two plates and both did not have much sauce in it.Price - ONLY S$2.50 per plate of soya chicken sauce noodles! It'd be $3 for bbq and roast pork noodles. The portion size is similar to the ones in the airconditioned outlets except those are priced almost DOUBLE.The queue is really long. Many people in the queue are foreigners. Maybe 40-60%?The master chef was there too but I think he deliberately goes somewhere else because once he's in the stall, the serving slows down - customers would want to take photos with the master chef! His wife mans the serving counter. I have never seen the master chef at the air-conditioned outlets. Perhaps all the more the hawker stall remains so popular?Food - I really love the soya sauce chicken! Very deserving of recognition! I wonder why Liao Fan doesn't put a limit to each orders? That will help speed up the queue. You see a person going up to the counter and then goes off with many many packets of food. If you have 2 hours to spare and good company with you, go for this hawker stall experience! Do not come here just to order bbq pork or roast pork -it's not worth it as you can get similarly good or even better ones in other stalls

I was walking in Chinatown a little after the busy lunch hour and decided to check out this 1-star Michelin restaurant that always has long line. To my surprise, there were only 8 people in line and I could order within 10 minutes, so I ordered the Soya Sauce Chicken with Noodles. The chicken was very soft and tasty, so I will give this restaurant a 5-star rating for the food quality and taste. The service is basically self-service and with the crowds that gather every day, I'll give it a pass
5
We waited an hour and half on a Tuesday to try the soya chicken. My mom and I tried the half chicken and bought some rice on the side and it was sooooo good! I highly recommend getting the whole or half of the chicken because you get more of different flavors and can appreciate more. It was worth the wait
3
Excellent dishes with the soya chicken the key highlight. Other hawker stalls will be equally-good for vegetable and pork rice. The marketing machine is working very well and one should visit to enjoy the hype....
3
This is an aircon place. Slightly crowd with no queue around 8pm.
Still prefer the "old taste" when they are still located at the hawker centre.

The chicken was soft n delicious.the pork ribs was recommended too.the bad side was the staff r quite rude.
4
Great pork selections with quick service in Chinatown. char sui and crispy pork very tasty with rice and sauces
3
Soya sauce chicken was Soft and tender. Noodles with the sauce was on the salty side. We also ordered half a chicken for takeaway . When we ask for more Chilli, the woman manning the counter told us that they can't give more as there were 2 very small containers of it packed in the container which was only half full, which obviously was not enough for half a chicken. I think they could be better with the take away request as the Chilli Was free flow if you are dining in. Don't expect any customer service from here
5
We'd heard about this place and decided we had to do it -So glad we did. We got there at 5:30pm and it was very busy (we opted for take-aways) but the line and food moved incredibly quickly. The lady that served us was very friendly and explained the different options to us. We ordered the Soya chicken with rice and the pork with noodles. Whilst both dishes were excellent, the pork was by far the best and the noodles were better than the rice! We expected a 30-40 min wait but from start to finish it probably took us 20 minutes (including waiting to order and waiting for the food).
4
This is the only hawker stall to have a Michelin star - so we are told! the stall is no longer in the food court, but has moved to the beginning of Smith Street. Order at the counter, take a number and wait as little as five minutes for your food. The half chicken is excellent.
5
I left this restaurant till the last day of my Singapore trip because there is always long ques but I am happy I braved out the wait. I waited maybe an hour in the to get in through the door, another 10 minutes to order and another 45 minutes to get the food after ordering. I was able to get a table fairly quickly (be prepared to share tables). The ordering process is through an ordering machine with the help of a staff member. You tell the staff member what you want and she does it all. I liked that you could see the picture of what you were ordering up close. I ordered the wonton soup and the soy chicken to eat there and I got the bbq pork to take away. The wonton soup's broth was lacking in flavor but the wontons were amazing!!! The soy chicken was tender and good flavor. The bbq pork (my take away) I had at the airport at night and it was amazing!!! even cold it was really good. Tender full of flavor. For all three of my dishes I believe it came to $17 SGP great prices for good portions. If you have the time it's a must try. My Singaporean friends say there are better chicken and rice in the city but this is a 1 Michelin star so for me it is worth a try

Just ate it tonight and quite disappointed with the service. The cashiers were rude and grumpy, maybe because it was too crowded and pack of customers. Becareful not to ask too much to them.Once you enter this restaurant, you need to queue to order your foods. Please read the sign board or the ladies at the cashier counter will yell at you. After you order and pay your foods, you need to wait for a moment (in my case that would be 30-40min standing). It will be better if you are not alone, so one of you can take a table first since there are not enough tables and seatsI dont know why the cashiers keeps taking order while the kitchen still overwhelmed with the orders before, not to mention there were a lot of customers that didnt get a seat.With that kind of service and the foods that tasted just ok, I dont think that i will be back agai
5
I have one word for this place.... YUM.... their soya chicken and BBQ pork is incredible this is def a must eat at when in Singapore. I would recommend getting here early as we got there about 5.20pm and had to wait in line about 40 mins as there was allot of people but it was well worth the wait
4
This place was good but they chop the chicken with the bones in is causing little bone shards throughout the meal. The place is busy.
4
I think this restaurant very feature of local food and the price can be accepted. But if you want eat it, please must be Q the long line.
4
Waited for an hour in Q to try this famous soya sauce chicken. Order their noodle and it was very oily but the soya sauce chicken is tender and tasty.
4
We read about this place and wanted to eat in a michelin starred street food restaurant !We went there for lunch, big queue outside, but worth a wait.Good food and great atmosphere, but we think a bit too many bones in the food.Enjoy this
4
@TheKuoKnowsWhen a place is billed as the "Cheapest Michelin Meal In Singapore", you have got to, at least, give it a shot.At $3.80, the risks are probably minimal but the rewards could be significant, if it lives up to the billing.Liao Fan came through with good marks.The long queues that many had predicted weren't that bad. But the wait from the time of ordering to getting the meal on the table was still around 20 minutes.The signature Soya Sauce Chicken is certainly every bit as good as I had expected. Each piece was tender and succulent and, most important of all, flavoursome.The Char Siu, which seems to take a back seat in promotional material, I thought, was the real star of the show. Biting through a beautifully caramalised outer layer exposed an equally outstanding tender piece of pork loin.Apart from the chicken and char siu, there doesn't appear to be a great deal more for discerning diners to sink their teeth into, though.Liao Fan doesn't pretend to do everything well. Then again, it doesn't need to. If it just focusses on the chicken and the pork, it won't go too far wrong
4
We ordered chicken noodles and char siew rice at its resturant outlet. The char siew was generous in portion and the rice was doused with sweet savoury sauce. The chicken noodles was the highlight, but it seems to get cold very fast after receiving the plate from the counter
2
Waited 30 mins at 8pm on a Friday. Noodle was cold. Chicken was tender but skin was not crispy. Roast pork was not crispy. Wanton was too big for the soup. You have to order soup separately. Tables were dirty and the queue system was a mess. Another 6 months and you won't have to queue anymore cos no one would bother.Very ordinary. A disappointment. Try the original at the hawker centre next door.
4
We ( I and my husband) was arrived almost 10 am, the restaurant was still closed but there was queue already, around 10 persons in front of us. Then when the restaurant opened, we queue to order the dish. We ordered Char Siew noodle with additional roasted pork ( SGD 6.8) and take away soya sauce chicken rice with additional pork rib ( SGD 5.8). The noodle is just ok, but the char siew was tender and juicy; roasted pork was crisp and juicy. Chicken rice was delicious, but I think if it would be marvellous if the rice is more fragrant and fluffier. The pork rib was not ok, it was too burnt. As a whole it was a cheap michelin star food
2
Place your "fast food" order, wait 20 minutes and get served cold food?Next, fight for a table and napkins do not exist. It was borderline chaos.Really? What was Michelin thinking?I spent a long, LONG time in an airplane for an over-hyped, low-end, food court experience as my first meal in Singapore. Hong Kong Soya Sauce Chicken Rice & Noodle may have been great before it was famous, but now it is a money-making joke at your expense. It is a cute scam, but should be totally offensive to anybody with a real Michelin Star or to you if you are expecting ANYTHING other than just cheap. I felt sad for the 50 other shops we blew past while asking for the exact location. This marketing ploy steals business from other small restaurants on the same block which are as least as deserving of my business. It reminded me of the worst new ride at Disney World. People line up to experience ... disappointment. Sad
3
Plain average!While they held their 1 Michelin star, you better give it a try. Keep your expectation low, don't expect a jaw dropping meal served for you!Went there on a weekday 3pm-ish, Q line is short, took me a good 30 minutes from standing in the Q line to get my meal. Clean, cooled & organized place.I liked the chicken noodle better than the chicken rice.But I've had a combo of better chicken and better service with a cheaper price before. So, I don't see this place deserved a half star.Try it once then stay out of it for good
4
I'm not a fan of everything else there except for the chicken. I thought it was mind-blowingly soft and juicy! Don't understand the star... I am very sure there are better tasting chicken rice stalls all over Singapore!
3
Is the chicken good? Not bad. But nothing in this restaurant justifies 1 * Michelin, not even the food. The portions are small, if you really want to taste the chicken ask for half a chicken and not just a plate with chicken.
1
If this Michelin One Star , then all MacDonald s are 3 star!!! Ordered their chicken, took 16 min standing up to pick up the order. The chicken was cold . Veggies were ok. This is just crazy hype . Stay away ..:(
4
The food is good, though I'm not sure it is really Michelin star worthy. There is always a crowd, but they move people through pretty quickly. It is insanely cheap for what you get, so great value!

Hong Kong Soya Sauce Chicken Rice and Noodle Is the Cheapest Michelin star meal in the world, that’s what they all saying? I went to the new restaurant in Chinatown and there was a short line outside the restaurant. I waited about 30 min to get in, before joining another line to place my order for another 30 min. Wouldn’t be going through all that trouble if it wasn’t for the publicity, but well, it was worth it. Being known as the cheapest Michelin Star food ever at $2.50 for a plate of their famous chicken and rice is a steal. However, it took me 1.5 hours of waiting. Much too long, but at the end of the day probably worth it. I must confess the chicken was juicy and soft and skin was packed with flavour. The pork with rice was also extremely good. Not to be missed if you can confront the lines. If waiting isn't your cup of tea, then try other stalls with similar cuisine, hawker Centre across the road. In conclusion it’s a restaurant that I would unquestionably recommend to my friends or any tourists to visit
1
Went to the restaurant as I wasn't sure If the original stall is still operating. So you come into a cold overcrowded "restaurant" and queue up to order or use the machine like in a McDonalds. Get a ticket and wait for your number to be called. I ordered chicken, pork, noodles. Everything except the chickens as cold. Nothing in common with a Michelinstar restaurant. Maybe the original was good, but what you get there is nothing but average streetfood
1
One of the worst experience I have had in singapore. Please go somewhere else for a proper chicken rice, this place is disgusting and my chicken was not eatable, see pics . @Michelin guide - I don't see how this restaurant can be listed in your guide. Disgraceful. Take it off
2
We found the stand inside the Chinatown Complex but unfortunately no one was there, just a sign announcing the new restaurant nearby. We waited for a while before giving in to try the restaurant.The restaurant is a sterile place with a fast-food atmosphere, serving what tastes like mass produced food that is barely kept warm. We tried the soya sauce chicken rice and the char sui pork noodles. As I said, we can't comment on the original food stand because it wasn't open, but the Smith St restaurant was unfortunately a disappointment
4
Compared to the restaurant this place tastes fresh and you get a glimpse how the hawker earned his star. It's the most competitively priced food in Singapore. People say they don't understand how he got this star?! Yeah, the taste is simple but that's why it works so well as its balanced. Mixed in with the price, that's why locals form a queue every day for hours on end
3
Maybe it was the hype from having a Michelin star, but I wanted to like the chicken rice much more. Of course everyone has different tastes, but it was nothing to write home about for me. Still, it's a pretty good bargain for a meal in Singapore
3
I cannot see the other sense of dinning here. Not sure how Michelin can grant them one star.
Overall the chicken is above average. Nothing else.
4
We had to try it since we were in the area. Arrived shortly after 11 am where a sizable queue had formed. The wait ended up being an hour! You actually queue up across the aisle from the stand and get waved over when it's your turn. Picture the Seinfeld Soup Nazi skit, order, move aside, get your food and leave promptly. I added a side of BBQ pork ribs. Both the soya chicken and ribs were good, not outstanding. Perhaps the one star was based on a combination of taste and value as the meal cost the equivalent of $2.50 USD. Next time we'll get there a lot earlier
4
Finally tasted the popular HK style soya sauce chicken noodle & BBQ pork. We went before the queue built up.The chicken and noodle are yummy, though a little on the sweet side. There are better bbq pork stalls like Fatty Cheong in Bukit Merah & Fei Fei in Jurong East
4
Yes no doubt it is good, but there are other stalls in the complex and other place in other parts of Singapore that sell the same thing, which are just as good. Its like different strokes for different folks, everyone has a different taste bud. I used to eat at this place every month before they got the Michelin star when the queue were not that long. But after they got the star and the queue is so much longer, I reckon that it was not worth the time anymore
5
After walking through Chinatown, I happened upon this place. I had to wait about 15 minutes, so it wasn't too bad of a wait. It was an early afternoon snack. The noodles were very delicious. Maybe a bit of the hype from the michelin star, but it was still really good nonetheless. I recommend you stop by here after your stroll through Chinatown
2
Went here as was keen to dine at a Michelin restaurant without the price tag. Came around 8:15pm with no line. Ordered the signature soy chicken. Service was quick but chicken came out. Cold - maybe it is meant to be like that. But inside was very raw, blood coming from the bone and the surrounding meat was bright red. Pretty sure its not meant to be like that. Rice was OK but its just rice... I don't know why you'd get excited about that. Felt like a chain restaurant and not the authentic michelin star hawker experience I was looking for
3
The lowest priced restaurant with a Michelin Star in the world. I was expecting something special. There was a line, but it moved quickly. The food preparation area looked promising, many people working hard and the food looked good. When we got our food and started to eat, I was disappointed. The chicken & rice that I had the day before at Chin Chin was much better. The bottom line is that if you're visiting Singapore you will want to eat here to be able to say that you ate at a one Michelin Star restaurant for less that $10. Then go to Chin Chin and have some delicious chicken & rice
5
They have finally moved out from the Chinatown food complex and now have their own restaurant. Their chicken and barbecue pork/ribs are well prepared and very tasty. Pricing has gone up, but still worth a visit even exclusively for them. I can witness their efforts to meet their 1 Michelin star. Well, it is still not the typical Michelin level in terms of the decoration, service quality, etc., but who cares? Typical Michelin starts are not given for the majority, but This restaurant is
2
The soya chicken is good but the rice is too dry on Thursday. It is a disappointing experience on my first visit to this new Aircon restaurant. Previously have a good meal from the market stall. Hope the management will keep up the standard in this restaurant for the many tourists that have make the effort to visit and queue for this national icon chicken rice
5
First of all, the place is in Chinatown so the restaurants don't look too clean. After you arrive usually you have to make a long line, but is totally worth it. The amount of food is limited and is only prepared for the day, so its better you arrive for lunch. The insignia dish is the chicken rice, and for me was the best one it has a delicious mix of flavors, also the roasted pork is really good. Especial mention for the price, incredibly cheap, is the cheapest meal i took in Singapore. All of this makes it a must go place, and you don't know maybe you could try your first Michelin star restaurant
4
Good and delicious food, but a little bit too cold. We waited about 15 minutes, but it was ok. Friendly staff. Clean place.
4
Must try the award-wining Soya Sauce Chicken. Char Siew - BBQ pork was up-to-standard too. On my first visit, Roast Pork and BBQ Pork was sold out by 6:30pm. On my next visit, I went for lunch and was able to try SS Chicken and Char Siew. Go early for dinner to avoid having leave with an empty-stomach. However, I wish the management would engage more staff in keeping the place clean and tidy especially in clearing the tables for waiting customers
3
My husband really wanted to visit here with him being a foodie and this being the first hawker to be given a Michelin star.Luckily enough the chef was funded to open a small restaurant which is run in a hawker style on smith street (which is a lot more appealing) so this eliminated a 3 hour wait like it was when it first opened and brought that down to a very bearable 25 minutes. If we were waiting for 3 hours to receive the food we did I would have been gutted at a wasted time on our trip BUT 25 minutes for lunch wasn't bad and glad we can say we tried it! The pork and chicken were both very tasty, very juicy and id happily have them again but the noodles and rice were literally plain as anything so don't expect anything fancy - and it comes with a horrible oily fish tasting sauce under the noodles (beware - my hisband eats everything and anything and the sauce took him by surprise and made him gag) BUT remember your there for the meat! Some tips:1.Be ready with your order before you approach the desk - due to the amount of people it attracts they like to keep it on a tight conveyer belt system.2. Get a bit of everything, the portions aren't big and the noddles/rice are nothing special and quite dry 3. go for the experience but maybe go for lunch so you can try one of the MANY special resturants around Singapor
4
We waited for an hour just to taste this Michelin-starred hawker stall. This food stall opens at 10 AM. We arrived around 15 past and there were about 10 people in the queue. Though Singapore is a hot place, it wasn't a problem since there were fans in every corner. The chef was interviewed by journalists from Japan or Korea that time but the service was not affected because his assistants (family members maybe) took over. The food prices are really cheap. I nearly ordered every dish they are selling because it was so cheap and since I waited for an hour for this why not order everything to taste them all. I did not regret doing so as all dishes were delicious. I am not a food expert but I really think this food stall deserves to have a Michelin award. Some people commented here that it is overrated but that doesn't mean it is not worth to pay a visit. If you are in Singapore, please do not miss this food stall if you have plenty of time. The most exciting part is queuing and noticing the line becomes longer and longer as the time goes by. You will realize that it is really a famous food stall in Singapore because of the queue. Please note that the owner opened a restaurant version of this hawker stall just few meters from the original located at Smith Street. It is an airconditioned restaurant. But I suggest you go for the food stall as it is more authentic and "technically" the one that was awarded by Michelin
5
Chinatown Complex location: If you get 2SGD Michelin star meal, what else can you give than 5 stars? Even if it's not absolutely the best chicken rice in the world, it's the ultimate experience and consistent quality. I've always been a big chicken rice fan, and this was top quality
3
I went there on a Sunday evening around 6pm-7pm only 20 people queuing wait for around 30mins to order my food.. they only left with soy chicken and side dishes :( so I order soy chicken rice and noodle and Thai Chilli fried tofu.. seatting was not Abd issues but all the tables were filled with empty plates and the whole place was just dirty.. only 1 cleaner cleaning up the tables .. nonetheless food is good esp the fried tofu is nice!! OH and I would recommend to try the soy chicken nOodles instead of the rice! NOodles is damn goooodd
3
This is the review for new branch on Smith street, with the A/C and efficient ordering system. Came here because of the michelin star. Arrived at 9.40, so there was no queue. (They open at 10 am). The soy sauce chicken rice was just ok. It doesn't taste bad, but nothing stellar. Not sure if the taste dropped from the pre-michelin period due to the over-production post-michelin
3
We were so excited to try the chicken as it won a Michelin star. When we finally reached the stall, we ordered several dishes including extra for take away. The prices are very cheap but to be honest, the food is totally average. Sure, it might be slightly better than the other hawker stalls serving this specific dish but that doesn't change the fact that it's poorly plated, very fatty and not creative. The chicken is tender and its skin is crispy, but we ended up throwing some of it away at our hotel room, unable to finish it all as we got quickly sick of the oversaturated sweetness and fat content of it all. In summary, really good street food, but not deserving of its accolades and definitely not worth the queuing time
4
Tried the food for the first time and giving it a thumb up. The meat are so tender that even I have braces also can bite without any problems. The cha siew worth trying as it got the balance of fats and meat with it. Half chicken only cost $12. Do try this stall if you come to Singapore
3
Visited the hawker center location (old location). Chicken with noodles tasted good, but that was it. Their neighbours can also cook. Waiting line about 30 minutes. The queue of next customers waiting, forms an audience whilst sitting eating. Ambience is like any local food market, not very clean, but fairly ok order in regards to removing items from tables. Worth a visit, one time, not two. Bring some own tissues, always handy, as there is a scarcity, or even total lack of serviettes. Excellent fresh fruit juices served at the opposite located juice stand
5
Found it really really amazing. Got there early so we didn't really wait long. The soy chicken was tasty and quite tender. Loved the 2 combinations of pork and the soup as well. 😍 oh my... that was one fantabulous meal. 😘
1
Cold fatty chicken, cold noodles, cold rice - unseasoned, what on earth is all the fuss about. Tiger beer was good though.
5
We first sought out this restaurant at lunchtime and the queue was horrendous so we went back in the evening when it was much more manageable. The downside to that was they had run out of pork so it was chicken or chicken. Not a disaster as the chicken lives up to its billing, succulent and very tasty. A must visit for anyone in town
4
There's a queue, but it moves in batches. Roughly 30 miss from the back of the queue to ordering. If you're in a pair, one person should find a seat (once you're past the door) while the other queues inside.If you go at about 7, the queue is shorter, but they tend to run out of food. Get their half chicken rather than rice/noodle with chicken. It's a lot more worth it. We would recommend trying it once, and then decide if you want to return. I personally would only return if the queue is short
4
The HongKong soya sauce chicken was delightful. The sauce is just delicious. Cheapest Michellin-starred meal I've had! The queue wasn't that long when I went as it was raining hard that day, and I think that contributes a lot to the experience. I'm not sure how impressed I would be if I had to wait for over an hour to eat
5
We tried it at the shop along Smith St, not the one inside the hawker centre. We came early at around 11 am. Fortunately, the queue was pretty short. We had a harder time parking at the Chinatown hawker centre as it is now the festive season.My wife ordered half a soya sauce chicken, a 3 meat mixed platter, a dish of vegetables, 2 rice and 2 noodles for 4 of us. We didn't wait long for our queue number to be called, yes, just like at a bank or hospital. Everything is self-service, you take your own dishes, cutlery, etc...The best was the noodles for me, tasty and impregnated with the soya sauce...The chicken was just alright, but not the mixed meat platter. Nothing fantastic about the roasted char siew. The roasted pork was good though.It cost us about S$30, good value at $7.50 per person at a 1 star Michelin hawker
3
I've been to the old and new location. Old location had the raw charm of being inside a hawker center, the new place is more chain-restaurant vibe. Still pretty good! You can get similar food in many places across Singapore, but that's not to say this isn't excellent. But if you want chicken and rice without the lines, not going here won't cause you to miss out massively, in my opinion. Still, if coming as a tourist, a good place to check off on your foodie tour
3
Wait about one hour to get dinner which was fine however the chicken I got was full of bones, blood and generally fat. I am sure I just got unlucky with the piece on my plate. Also had the greens and fried tofu which were yum. Would go back but would try the pork next time
2
I was proud that my own country finally has a Michelin-Starred restaurant. You noticed I used 'was'.... Yes, today, I took the effort to spend about 30 minutes in the queue and decide for myself if it is as good as it is rated and if it was still as good as before it was rated with 1 Star.The ordering system is meant to be automated but because limitations in the software such as only have English, complicated if you want a certain combination of meat to be served with rice or noodles, a staff has to be present entering into the system. This partly why the queue is long.My family of 4 ordered simple set meals that comes with a can drink ranging from S$6 to about S$12 per set. It is about twice the price if you had ordered the same before it was rated with 1 Star.After we ordered, we have to clear a dirty table for ourselves. There is no system for diners to return used utensils nor is there sufficient staff to clear and clean the tables are each seating.After the order and another 15 to 20 minutes wait,our order number was flashed and we collected our food. The plating remains unchanged, just like any hawker or street food serving. Messy but acceptable. The famed soya sauce chicken is still good. Soft and tender and juicy.The Char Siew (lean BBQ pork) and Siew Yoke (Roasted Pork Belly with Crusty Skin) are below average. They are dry and salty and not much of a favor. I rate it 2-3 over 10. There are many similar roasted pork that are better at Level 2 of the Food Court just above the wet market. Overall, I have been there, tried it and done. I will not return, even without a queue.
3
The wait was not too long which might be an indication that the hype is dying down. It was good, it was cheap but I would not in any way think this was a Michilin Star worthy meal. But hey I can add it to my list of adventures
5
Stay the course and keep in the queue. The food is great and the atmosphere is cool. Not what I would give a Michelin star for, but what the heck? Why not?
3
It's cheap....the soy chicken rice is $3.80....its famous.....there's ALWAYS a queue, and frankly its a bit of a disappointment. Small portions too....we were still hungry, so went round the corner to Chinatown for a much better 1/2 roast duck afterwards.
4
a restaurant with michelin star with mid range price. q for 30m. there's air-con dining place. self services style,order and pick urself. ordered half chicken and mix 叉烧烧肉,dont forget the chili sauce
4
We tasted both chicken and pork. In my mind pork was better but my wife prfered chicken. Marginals in good Singapore's restaurangs are very small, so this was in the well in the line with other good ones. Of course Michelin Star make it special.
4
Surprising that hawker chicken rice can be so yummy. The Soya Sauce chicken rice (香港油鸡饭) from Liao Fan which got the one Michelin-starred are fantastic, perfect Soya Sauce, perfect chilli Sauce, meat are tender, moist, flavourful and heavenly, as well as the noodle too. We have been waited for an hour just for that chicken rice but it's worth waiting. Thump up
3
We only queued for about half an hour to wait for this much hyped Michelin starred "Hawker" stall, which was considered good from what I've heard. It was only 4pm :) Was it worth the wait? Well the soya sauce chicken was great and very tender and juicy, but the rest, dare I say it, was just average. Then again, whilst Michelin starred, the price that we paid was very cheap, so there wasn't too much to complain about. Would I recommend? Yes if you just want to tick the Michelin bit from your bucket list, but if you see the queue that's more than one hour's wait, I'll find somewhere else.
4
Just had to go to this Michelin rated chicken rice resturant and if you go on Saturday am it might be worth the trip. The web site says they are open ate 10 am on Saturday but the sign at the stall says 11am. I arrived on Saturday at 930a and was 5 Th in line because the sign said 11a most people would look at the sign and leave thinking that the wait was 1 1/2 hours Well on Saturday they do open at 10 am so my total wait was 35 minutes The soya chicken was a little dry but the roast chicken and roast pork were both excellent. Definitely worth the trip especially if you go on Saturday a
3
This is the much publicised street hawker with a Michelin Star. I have wanted to eat here for ages but the queue has always been too long. But today as I passed there was only a short queue so I joined. I had their signature dish and it was okay. But the trouble with high expectations is that they are rarely met. And I just thought this was an average meal with very little meat. Some people queue for three hours to get in. I would not wait that long. It's okay but that's it.
3
I love going to the hawker stalls in Singapore and trying out all the different kinds of food. There are plenty of places that serve chicken and rice or noodles but even more that serve really interesting things like fish stews and frog and really giant crab. I am not a huge fan of chicken but decided to eat at this stall to understand how a tiny little dirty stall could earn a one star rating from Michelin. It was probably about 100 degrees waiting in the second floor of the original hawker center at the Chinatown Complex so that may have made me less inclined to be positive about the experience. However, after waiting for about 45 min, I finally reached the front of the line where I ordered soya sauce chicken with rice and a portion of the soya pork, just to give it a try. While I thought the sauce was good, the chicken was really nothing exceptional. The pork was actually tastier and more interesting. Since I only paid about $3 US for the meal, I didn't really feel like I have a right to comment too harshly, and although I can see that this man is working very hard to do his chicken the best he can and feed a very hungry, unending crowd, for my taste, I think that Michelin should be more judicious and save its stars for the real stars. That being said, if you want a really cheap meal that is very good, head over to the original stall or for about $5 head over to the ground floor restaurant that is now open and has air conditioning
4
I'd have preferred to give a 3.5 rating for our trip. It was above 'average' but 'very good' is too generous for our experience. The rice was a bit dry/hard for me, the noodles overly savoury for her. But...well the chicken, the centrepiece was lovely and moist. And the very busy staff were courteous. Queue midweek approaching 8pm was 20mins long, and unfortunately all the pork was sold out which was a pity as wanted to sample it. At the end of the day we're all there for the Michellin starred hawker food. Its a fine idea but we left underwhelmed and a little puzzled to be honest. Maybe its the pork
5
The fresh and tasty food adds wonderful experience in my Singapore trip. Staff are well trained in service. Singapore is food paradise. And it's a good example. Don't miss the opportunity to enjoy the food if you plan to walk around China town.
4
i tried the chicken and char sew noodle, since they don't provide hainan rice. the chicken is so tender and juicy. the seasoning for the noodle was excellent. and the char sew is beyond expectation
5
The local food of chinatown is a must and Liao Fan's Hawker food stall and restaurant was absolute execution on what he wanted. The taste, flavor, and way they cook the chicken and pork was delicious. A must place to visit especially a Michelin rated restaurant is worth it alone
5
This place is worth the hype. Both the rice and noodle versions of their soy sauce chicken is delicious. We tried the roast pork too which was also very good but the chicken is the real star. There was a line when we got there around 10:45 and we waited about 30 minutes and it wasn't bad. Make sure to go to the back of the queue which starts across from the hawker stall as we saw a lot of people trying to go right up to the front and get yelled at

P.S: I have downloaded this app specially to share this honest opinion of mine.To summarise:1) Chicken serving was pathetic for $5. (Do refer to photo)2) No deboning for chicken. (Seriously?)3) Noodles was tad salty. Rice was nothing like chicken rice.4) Chicken breast meat was really tough. (Do request for chicken drumstick instead but be prepared to compromise on the serving - Refer to photo)5) Bad service provided. In conclusion, you can have better soya chicken rice elsewhere
5
This was my first time here and i would definitely go back ! We went early to avoid the queues (about 10am) and there was still a short wait. We shared a soya chicken with noodles and a side of char siew pork. Despite being renowned for the chicken, the char siew pork was actually the highlight for me! The meal only cost us $6, so great value. There is soya chicken, char siew pork, pork ribs and pork belly. You can have accompanying rice, noodles or rice noodles or you can order meat only. It was a fantastic Singaporean experience
5
This place lives up to the hype. The soy sauce chicken was spectacularly tender and tasty. The star for me is actually the char siu. The best I've had by far. Please note that this is NOT Hainanese styled chicken rice so do not expect the rice to be cooked in chicken stock and fat. It appears that some reviewers were disappointed because they had the wrong expectation.
5
Yes, there is a line. Yes, they run out of food so you have to get there early. Level set those expectations now Once you sink your teeth into the delicious chicken and rice, you'll forget the line. It's so worth it. Over order. You'll want more. I want more. If you can read this, please send me more
5
Yes it's hyped, yes there's a line, yes it's the 1 Michellin star food stand. So go? YES! It's worth the wait. We arrived 9:45 a.m. before they opened at 10 a.m. at the new sit down restaurant. Highly recommend this because there are more options and it's newer and guaranteed seating and has AC. You will pay a little more, but come on we are talking $1.25 USD vs $2.50 USD for their amazing chicken dish. We ordered other items the hawker stand does not offer which were sides of noodles and just BBQed pork and roast pork. I'm telling you, it's one of the best soy sauce chicken, roast pork and BBQ'ed pork I have ever had an I live in the SF Bay Area
2
We're pretty open-minded and does not have any high expectations or whatsoever but the standard of the food was pretty low than average. Even the chicken rice that we had at Changi Airport and Suntec mall's food court were better than this.Furthermore, the plating of the food was really sloppy (different from the photos shown in their menu) and the rice was slightly cold and undercooked. The only nicer parts of the chicken rice were the price, tenderness of the chicken and the chilli sauce that came with it
4
Queued an hour before we got through the door. They have tried to automate the food ordering but it does not work and still requires someone to help people order. Food was good, but not good enough to queue an hour for. I guess I can say I have eaten in a Michelin One Star and it only cost me $2
5
Waited 2 hours. But didn't care, was with my wife and we spent the whole time chatting with other people in the line and took turns grabbing small snacks from other stalls to keep us in high spirits. Ultimately the main dish is what we chose (they ran out of pork just before we ordered) and it was DELICIOUS!! Highly recommended, and cool experience to eat at the first hawker restaurant that was awarded (and rightly so) a Michelin Star.
5
Together with my wife we waited patiently for one hour before we got our half portion soya sauce chicken and a plate of dry noodles. The succulent chicken has been well cooked with Chef Chan's concoction of soya sauce together with some secret Chinese spices. The chicken skin is very well marinated and cooked inside a pot of rich fragrant soya sauce. As proof of how delicious it is, the chicken skin can easily be eaten alone even without the meat or chilly sauce. The specially prepared chilly sauce tastes heavenly and complimented very well with the chicken. Suggest to really savour and enjoy the Michelin starred soya sauce chicken order one bird separately. Then combo with a plate of dry noodles or rice to go with it. Don't worry about the price. Inexpensive and excellent value.
4
We went to the original stall in chinatown hawker complex. Arrived there about 10.40am and there was a long line alrady. By about 12 noon we got our food. It was delicious.The chicken meat was tender and juicy. Chicken skin was crispy. Oh and order more chicken as you may want to eat more of it . Otherwise you have to line up all over again for 2nd round. Food was cheap. At $ 2 per plate of chicken rice and $7 for a half plate chicken, it's worth it 
1
After hearing of the Michelin fame we went to the 78 Smith location and waited more than an hour in line, inside it was crowded and they were just pumping people through the place. Granted it was cheap, but also I have had better chicken rice in practically every other hawker location in Singapore. Probably the original - before fame and commercialization struck - was extraordinary but this place isn't. More fast food than hawker food now and I would recommend you do sth better with your time
5
I went on day 1 of my trip and unfortunately they sold out after it reaches my turn. Not giving up, i went back 2 days later. Trust me, it worth all the effort. Cheapest Michelin star food and it is super good. Wouldn't mind lining up for an hour for this
5
We visited the new outlet at 78 Smith Street, which goes by the name of Liao Fan HK Soya Sauce Chicken Rice and Noodle. This outlet is a restaurant and air-conditioned. It opened at 10 am. We arrived at 10.30 am when 3/40f the tables were already occupied and 10 people in front of us in the queue. It took us 20 minutes to place our order and another 10 minutes to collect our food. The bottleneck seems to be in the kitchen and many on-site diners with take-away orders as well. We ordered half chicken and 2 plates of plain noodles. These were delicious, but the bowl of wonton soup disappoints as it tasted flat. The glass of cold Chinese flower tea was most welcoming.
5
The cheapest Michelin starred food on the planet...and probably the least pretentious! Hawker Chan has a limited menu of four main meats with either noodle or rice. Well worth she wait...or you can go to his new restaurant venture a stones throw away. Same food, updated venue
4
I wouldn't wait in line again, but it was delicious. We waited about 2 hours, but it was right after he was awarded the Michelin star. We had fun waiting in line and chatting with other people from Singapore. We enjoyed that a lot. Also, it was the best food at a food stall that I have ever had. It's not filling, but will satiate your appetite for the time being. It's the only worthwhile food place in Chinatown
3
First LOCATION! The address is listed as a stall in the Chinatown Food Complex, but when we went there at 6pm in the evening, but this stall was closed. They have opened a restaurant a stones-throw away on the corner of Smith Street & New Bridge Road. Big awnings proclaim "Cheapest Michelin star blah, blah". You cant miss itWe queued at the restaurant (there is nearly always a queue) but it went pretty fast we waited about 15 min from the street to ordering. A waiter came out and warned us they only had 13 chickens left and there were a lot of people in line. We decided to wait and got in as did many people behind us. (this was about 6:30pm it closes at 7)Apparently there have been some tax issues at the restaurant and so ordering is done via a screen and you take a buzzer and wait. In the meantime you can avail yourself of the condiments - sauce and chilis.Finding a clean table was also an issue. At the end of a meal people just leave their trays, but the clean up crew were lethargic and slow.When the food eventually arrived, the portions were very small with a lot of bones. OK it was cheap at S$5.30 for meal and drink, but honestly I think I had better chicken rice at other places - obviously not Michelin starred.All in all for the experience, a cheap, reasonable meal and bragging rights it is worth it. But if you are looking for really excellent food I would go elsewhere
4
delicious food served instantly, the first michellin starred hawker restaurant in the world. we have tried their new location, not the hawker stall that they previously had, it's in a restaurant in Smith street. you have to line up to get in this restaurant.
4
After 1 hour and 20 minutes we got our 3 dishes we ordered and the food was great. The absolutely best "food stall" food I have had. The waiting time was negative but it was worth it:)
3
I know it's the first street food stall to earn a Michelin star, but seriously, you should wait hour and a half for street food. It looses the whole purpose.The place is always packed, with long long queues. They offer in the menu variety of dishes but many weren't available. Food was nice, but being completely unbiased and if it weren't for the Michelin star, I wouldn't recommend it if you have a tight schedule
5
There are two of these restaurants in the China town – the new one is on Smiths Street and the original one is on the second floor of the Chinese market. I prefer the original one. The restaurant is actually a small kiosk in which food is prepared. Food is eaten on tables that are shared with the surrounding restaurants. There are quite a few other restaurants and in fact they are all very good! It just would not be undeservedly if some of them get the same recognition.The original Hong Kong Soya Sauce Chicken Rice & Noodle restaurant serves only several meals on very affordable prices. I prefer noodles instead rice. Chicken is excellent but pork is even better! The chicken was really crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. It is difficult to determine which part of the chicken is served because it is all white and soft meat.You should not be surprised if you encounter a row of several dozen people waiting. If you are late, you probably will not have all the dishes at choice. Tables are not the cleanest but it is part of the authentic atmosphere. Drinks can be purchased at nearby kiosks. It is interesting that beer is three times more expensive than this excellent meal. However, I recommend that you order two dishes - the portions are small and worth and try different delicious dishes!The new restaurant is not very successful fusion of McDonald’s and Asian street restaurants. Therefore, should eat in an original and often. Although it is worth to try other restaurants on this market
5
Undoubtedly one of the best chicken rice and chicken noodles Ive ever eaten. The ruce seems like it is just white rice, but it's not - it's fragrant and flavoursome that my dad called it special (big compliment from him!). The highlight for the chicken is the soya sauce flavour on the skin - out of this world! The sambal with the noodles is also a highlight. In total for a chicken rice and chicken noodle, I paid $sgd5! If you can't get in the hawker stall, they have opened a new restaurant downstairs at 78 Smith Stree
5
We had hunted out this hawker food stand one afternoon as they were closing up for the day. We were told that the best time to line up for a meal was first thing in the morning so we arrived at 8:30 and found there were six people already in line. The owner and cook Chan Hong Meng had recently been awarded one Michelin Star and was busy preparing a mountain of ducks as well as some pork. We learned that he would open for business around eleven o'clock.So, we settled down to enjoy an entertaining morning chatting to the ever-increasing queue of locals and to watch the cooking process unfold. Those before us came with large orders so we progressed slowly to the front of the line but eventually, at 12:30 our turn finally arrived. We had not had breakfast and so ordered large portions and sat down on the humble plastic furniture to enjoy the best chicken and pork dishes we had ever tasted. Yes, the wait was four hours long, but worth every entertaining minute. Oh, and the cost of this superb meal was a total of $11.00 for two! Don't miss out on this experience
5
Must try what a 1 star michelin is like. Que up even though was told its gonna take at least an hour and its 2.30pm and not noon! While this caucasian guy who spoke excellent mandarin was explaining his anguish at not being to get his hand on a plate of this 1 star soy chicken with noidle for S$4.50. He came over some time ago, qued at the new Hawker Chan Hong Kong Soy Sauce Chicken. Realising its gonna take a while due to the long que and knowing that the original stall is still operating at the hawker centre he sizzled over there and qued again. By the time his turn come around the stall said "sold out" no more chicken. So, he came down again and tried 1/2 an hour to covince the person i/c of que to let him in without queing (he could have qued in the meantime but didn't and of course he couldn't cut the que. Was watching him. After another 10 minutes pondering he qued again. Poor guy hope he relished the chicken when he finally get it.Right lets get to the taste. Firstly I really don't fancy soy chicken but this is a must try. To date the trip advisor result is101 thinks its excellent good ir average and 11 thinks its poor or terrible. In other 10 % do not like it. Generally those that don't were mostly caucasians and those that like were mostly asian. Cause nearly all reviews for restaurant have about 10% negative feedback. My feedback? *****! YES 5 Stars.Why? The chicken so tender, melts in your mouth and the seasoning unique.The chilli paste...perfect. The noodle...Al Dente. The char siu... so so. The Roast pork ...so so.The helping... S$4.50 for a pretty large plate...worth it. Where can you get a Michelin 1 star meal for S$4.50?There were already famous and crowded way before the Michelin Star. I stand my ground. They deserve it. Will it last? Don't know.

Chicken Rice is suppose to be a bit under cooked - some even like it on the bloody side. At this stall they cook it the way it is suppose to be cooked (no blood though). It is always served at room temperature. If your not familiar with chicken Rice, then order the Char Siew (roasted pork) with noodles - you will enjoy it more, but don't expect the pork to be warm, it does not come that way
1
Am a local. I should be proud of my own country man getting the honour. But no, I take food seriously. The chicken taste uncooked. The rice blend with their sauce. The noodles ok. The char Siew ok+. The chicken noodle stall that is near the Indian temple is wayyyyyyyy better then theirs. Will not go again for sure. Those who like it, may have different taste from me, selective...
2
Went to the hawker stall just as they were closing, so they said we should go to their new restaurant, just across (named Hawker Chan Hong Kong...; No TA entry yet).When we got to the queue around 6.45pm, we were told there's no point waiting as there's not enough chicken. We did wait - for 10mins, rather than the advertised 60mins - and chicken was actually available.The chicken was just OK - closer to being tasteless than being good. The noodles it came with were nice, but honestly our party had much better meals at other hawker stalls over the past few days.Definitely not worth the novelty factor - do yourself a favour and go somewhere else
5
Recommended place to go...
除了鸡饭，他们的叉烧也很好吃。。very reasonable price... I go in the evening time...too bad... the roasted pork finish already...so can't taste it... i will be again
3
Had to queue to get in to restaurant, then queue to order and wait for food very much like a fast food chain. Ran out of pork rib however noodles were delicious but chicken came full of bone and barely any meat and was slightly cold- gross. The barbecue pork however was amazing, although on the cold side too. Seemed so promising but we left still hungry, potion sizes small. Glad we tried but probably wouldn't go back, not sure why anyone would wait 2 hours in queue for this.
1
Well, to be honest, any Chinese restaurant in Germany is better by far. Highly overrated. He has now his 15 minutes of fame. I question what guide Michelin brought to this decision. The food is hardly tasty, it is cold, the atmosphere is horrible, the chicken is bony. Only suitable for Chinese. Avoid this place and don't give in to this inscrutable hype. He will not prevail the star.
3
We stood in line for more than 90 minutes to taste the famous Michelin soya sauce chicken. What can I say? What a disappointment. I've had much better chicken rice in other hawker stalls in Singapore before. If he didn't have a Michelin star (what for I have to ask?), I would have never ever waited for that long for an average meal. Thank goodness the portion was tiny....not only that, but there were too many bones and gristle in the chicken so that we could really eat only a few pieces. Not sure what all the rage is about. Heard the same comments from other who were in line with us. The best part is the price. Other than that-don't fall for the hype. The food court is rather gross and dirty as well, there are so many better places to eat here
5
I queued before they opened and after 1 and a half hours I was served. The soya sauce chicken was tender and very tasty. We also tried the roast meats and was very surprised to agree that the char siew was also very good. Thank goodness they have since opened a sitdown restaurant closeby and the stall will still operate. Hopefully my next trip will not require such a long wait
3
Because of its 'Always a long queue' fame, we paid Hong Kong Soya Sauce Chicken Rice & Noodle a visit but everything was sold out early, so we had chicken rice at a hawker a few shops down which was superb. Not beaten, we went early the next day, queued for 65 minutes, got our Michelin starred chicken rice and some BBQ pork stuff, only to be disappointed by the ordinariness. How does Michelin star work? The chicken rice we had the night before was far more superior and iconic
5
It is a a good idea to go there for an early lunch, saves a lot of waiting time. Had the chicken and roasted pork with noodles and it was very nice also for my wallet ;-). Amazing they have a ordering kiosk in their new location opposite from the food market
3
It's certainly worth a visit if you have time to wait in the long queue to get in (~60 min). I was a bit disappointed that the original Hawker stall is no longer open for business in the China town centre, but I guess that's a sign of the success of the business. Overall the food was very nice (especially the chicken and wantons) and retained the Hawker Stall prices (£3.80 for chicken and rice; $5 for Wanton soup) so you certainly can be disappointed with the price for Michelin starred food. The only downside for me was not getting to experience the true feeling of Hawker food in the new restaurant....for that I went back to the Maxwell Rd centre on a few occasions
3
There were 60 people in line but we decided for a one star michelin restaurant we would wait. And wait we did for over an hour. Also wanted ribs but they were sold out and it was only 1 PM. Chicken was tasty but we've had better
4
Why has no one mentioned the fact that the long wait is due to having to place ALL orders through the single machine at the head of the queue? That's where the hold up is, making it appear to be more popular than it merits.The original location in the building across the street (Chinatown Complex Market & Food Centre; stall #02-126) should still be in operation . . . that might be another option if the wait is too long.Food was good, can't complain about that
5
The food was very tasty. I would go back there again and again. The only downside of this is the queue of people.
3
Long queue for the food. One Michelin star. Very affordable price. Food is just average. Definitely not worth the one hour queue for the food. Grossly over rated.
4
Very good and tasty. Queuing for 2 hours is part of the deal. One of the cheapest stall in the Chinatown complex. Chef Chan remains humble despite his Michelin recognition.
5
As they are moving we could not appreciate the food. They moved this week from the Hawker's Centres Chinatown Food Complex to the corner building. Fingers crossed to the new chalenge.
1
I've eaten at other food stalls in Singapore and have been very pleased. I tried this stall to check for the said 1-star Michelin. We were there at 19:30 on a Tuesday and it was closed, looked like they were having some kind of celebration as some people were in the place.So we decided to come back tomorrow same time. We wait for around 45 minutes and ordered chicken noodles & roasted pork rice, no pork ribs either beer were available (?). Rice was awful and noodles not worth waiting so long to get them. We eat much better at other Singapore stalls...very disappointing!Looks like Michelin stars are much more expensive to win in other countries...
5
After 75 minutes queueing, my husband and I got our half chicken with 3 rice plates, and it's worth the wait !! The soya bean paste ON THE RICE is fantastic and it's really very different from other shops. It's more tasty, thicker that make you keep wanna eat and eat and eat more. The chicken meat is also nice, but the sauce on the chicken is different from the one on the rice. Tips: 1. We started queueing at 1.45pm and got our plate at 3pm and at this moment, other dishes were sold out like vegetables, char-siu and pork rib which we also want to try. So you better start queueing early..2. Ask them for more sauce (the one they put ON THE RICE but not on the chicken) because it is really really delicious ! Bon appÃ©tit !
3
We went on Saturday and still have to wait over one hour. We really wanted dark meat ( thighs) but we got white ( breast). The meat was tender but no taste. The breast has no skin, no soy source taste or color. Not worth it. The BBQ pork was great mainly because it was quite fatty. Great taste and texture but not too healthy. Well can't have it both way. Not sure I will come back.
5
Today was the opening of their new outlet on 78 Smith Street, a few meters from their main location. Line was not as long. So we went for their specialty - soy chicken.The meat was moist, tender and flavourful. And compared to other chicken hawker stall, their price is quite reasonable. The dedication and hard work of Chef Chan comes through the chicken he serves
5
This is probably the cheapest Michelin-star full meal I've encountered. I know Din Tai Fung and Tim Ho Wan are also cheap, but thats mainly dimsum, which I still consider a snack more than anything. HK Soya Sauce Chicken is a full meal - Soya Chicken or roast pork on top of a bed of rice or noodle for 2 SGD. That chicken is tasty. really tasty. A friend of mine stood motionless in front of the stall for 15 mins hoping the owner would still sell him a couple of plates (for him and myself), as he was already closing up shop. Seeing that my friend was not budging, he finally relented and pulled a couple of plates from under the counter which he had saved - he was probably going to eat it but hey, he gave in to my friend.. Total cost for 2 plates = 4 SGD. The tenderness of that chicken and the sauce it was brined in, I still vividly remember, and I will definitely go back, earlier this time, and order maybe 3 plates
2
I'm not sure if they were having an off day but we waited for 2.5 hours to be greeted by an unfriendly lady who sternly told us the pork was finished. We of course chose the chicken and rice which was the most disappointing food we tried on our whole trip - all skin, bone and gristle and nothing special taste-wise compared to other local dishes we tried. All hype and no substance in our experience. I'm sure the food on the other stalls nearby would be great with no wueye
2
Not sure why a Michelin star. My chicken was so full of smashed bone I could not eat it. Yes it's cheap, yes the line was 45 minutes long, but soooooo disappointing. Not worth the hype. Not Michelin worthy.
3
I visited with a friend who lives in Singapore - we go there at 11:30 and didn't reach the front of the queue to be served until 2:45pm. I actually nipped for a coffee with a friend as I was ready to give up but my mate persisted. Sadly, when we got to the front of the queue almost everything on the menu (6 dishes) was finished and so we went for the classic chicken rice dish. And it was good, but by good enough to spend three hours queuing. And actually, my chicken was a little dry. By the time we left at three, there was still a queue of around 100 people. And the chef was working at full speed. I'd recommend as a go to see, not to eat type of place.
4
honestly never knew this restaurant at chinatown complex. Had heard of others similar ones selling similar food. tried this out recently, and actually not bad. only heard of them when they got the michelin one star recently. I believed they could be the first hawker stall to obtained that michelin rating. news came out that the owner had ventured into partnership to expand the outlet , first one will be nearby at smith st nearby at chinatown. hope the quality doesn't drop as happened to most others when they expand.current location is a bit inconvenient for dining except for a quick lunch. Sorry jumped the long queue recently as unaware of the long queue behind. price very affordable, imagine sing 2 for a chicken drumstick dish
5
I had to see for myself what the buzz with this first ever Michelin starred hawker food stall is all about. My husband and I lined up at 1000 am and it was not until a little after noon that we finally had our chance to order. We ordered the chicken rice and a plate of roasted pork. Total cost: Sing$7.00. The chicken was very tasty and tender, with the meat falling off the bone. It was truly worth the wait. TIP: OVER ORDER. The servings are small so it would be wise to order a lot. You don't want to regret not having ordered a lot - - because of how good it really tastes, and also because of the long wait. If you can't finish it, it's always good to take home
5
Like everyone else, I queued for 2 hours for my chicken and surprisingly I must say it was worth the wait. Chicken was smooth and flavorful. There's many other stalls selling a similar dish within the hawker center, and I've tried some of them and this was the best by far. No wonder there's such a long queue daily.
4
In a 2nd floor of the complex, we waited for about 2 hours to get it, and to tell the truth the location wasn't pleasant. With only fan, no AC. The price is even cheaper then chicken rice next stand. Yet the food itself is super delicious, worth waiting
3
Let me start with: I LOVE street food!! We went after seeing several write-ups about the Michelin Star... We patiently and excitedly waited in the 1.5hr line ... And we're left unsure why this place was given a star. The food was good, but not great. We've had better street food, We've had better Chinese food at our fav local shop, and we've had better fine dining foods. We are more likely to go back to Chinatown Complex and try some of the other stands
5
It's one of the first Street Vendor to earn a Michelin Star in Singapore and now it's a famous and popular Stall in Singapore with a big queue waiting for their turn to come and really it's awesome one must visit this place for tasty food.
4
For really small money. I was there around 5pm and only had to wait for 10 minutes. I think the message of this Michelin star is to leave the expensive snobby restaurant and try the food at the food stalls and hawkers, they have really great food.
4
This stand is on the second floor of the China Complex in China Town. Easy to locate between numerous stalls in the complex with a long queue in front of it :) We have been there around 15:30, queued for half an hour (which is quite short when other reviews are concerned), however they have only chicken left. We tried rice and noodle chicken. Chicken was perfectly cooked, juciy and the skin was crisp. We liked noodle more than rice. We paid only 3 USD for two chicken. It is admirable that the owners did not change of the price of the meals after they received a Michelin star, they only expect longer queues. Worth tasting if the queue is not longer than 1 hour
5
It opens at 11, but the queue starts early. Be prepared for a 2-hour wait for Liao Fan and its famous, Michelin-starred soya soya sauce chicken rice, noodles, roast pork and other awesome dishes at really low prices.
4
the queue on a late Saturday afternoon was only one hour. But by the time I got to the order spot around 4PM, they had only chicken left. my chicken noodle was delicious: slightly springy noodles blended with a tasty spicy sauce and a perfectly roasted chicken with skin left on. the chicken meat itself was too soft for my likings. But for 2.5SGD, this was fantastic. do i want to wait at least one hour often for this? definitely NO but i might do that again and try the roasted pork. heard their roasted pork and char-siew tastier than the chicken
4
Many people have written about this place... lot´s of videos on Youtube. It´s great that Singapores Hawker centers get´s this attention, so many chefs are serving excellent food in a humble and cool surrounding. I just love strolling around and trying new things! Mr Chan, the prized chef currently have at least 2 1/2 hour waiting line prior to lunch. The chicken is still 2 sing dollar, which is amazing. It´s a great dish still, lovely cooked chicken... but to me, his Char Siew is his best dish
4
My friends and I were in queue for 2 hrs on a early Sunday afternoon to have lunch at the cheapest Michelin-starred food place. The chicken was perfectly cooked, no complaints whatsoever. Will I wait in line at least 2 hrs again for a 5-dollar whole chicken? Maybe not
4
but the Uncle's smile made the whole experience nicer. The total experince of queing up, wait your turn, contact with the owner, pay for your food and carried the plate of chicken rice, looking for an empty spot/seat and enjoying the chicken rice was nothing new in Singapore. Expect to wait, I mean at times, a long wait. IMHO: enjoy your food, relax a while and that's how you spend your break time......
5
My work colleague and I queued up for 2 and a half hours for lunch at this place. We weren't disappointed. The chicken and noodles were sensational. Even though the line up was a long time, we took turns holding our place in the queue so that we both had a chance to have a look at the rest of the hawker market. Do yourself a favour and get a juice from the juice place across from the noodle stall. It will keep you hydrated as you wait. Again, well worth it for the experience as well as the 'journey'.
5
We were told about this place and wanted to taste this Michelin star-awarded food. We knew already there are quite long queues in there, but I couldn't ever imagine what I first saw at 10am (opening time). We queued for more than 2 hours and weren't sure if we'd try the famous soy chicken rice since we were already late to catch a flight. We were lucky at the end, could try it and catch the flight during the final call. What I mean with this is the wait was totally worth. Amazing experience in this local market for 2 hours, nice to know the story of this hawker and nice to meet him and see live his cooking skills. Just be patient
5
Been here last week and queued for 1h, from 2 to 3 PM. Everybody was taking selfies with the queue, the stall and the food. The chicken and the pork are some of the best I've ever had (the pork is #1 for sure). The rice is good as well, but also try the noodles.It all works perfectly with some 1.2$ fruit juice from the stall opposite Hong Kong.Bottom line, It's worth it, you have to try it, it's incredible value for money

After eating at countless chicken rice stalls in Singapore, I would say that this is above average. I took away one star for the extremely long queue.My husband and I arrived at 9:30 am and there were already about 10 people in front of us. The stall opened at about 10:40 am, and we got our chicken rice at 11:20 am. So it is about 40 minutes for 10 customers. Do you calculation when you decide to queue. My advice is that it is not worth queuing for more than 1 hour. Even though the chicken is better than many stalls, it is not that good. I found it too salty, and the chicken breast is slightly dry. If you die die must try, then get someone, for example your husband to queue for you like I did hahaha. Actually queuing with a partner is important in case one of you need to take a toilet break. Also don't forget to bring your ipad/iphone etc and keep yourself entertained.The best and cheapest soya sauce chicken rice I have eaten was more than 30 years ago at Upper Cross Street. There was a shop with 2 stalls selling the same soya sauce chicken and it was heavenly, much better than this stall with one Michelin star. However that shop at Upper Cross Street closed down, and although now there is a shop along the same street which claims to be the same shop, the quality has dropped.My current favourite is the marinated farm chicken with Chinese herbs and soya sauce at the Summer Pavillion restaurant at the Ritz Carlton hotel. Yes it is much more expensive at $26 for half a chicken but I assure you that the taste is 10 times better, and the environment is 100 times better. Best of all, there is no queue!If you are a tourist and is not used to the hawker stall environment, you will find it very uncomfortable and unhygienic to eat at the Chinatown complex. So consider carefully before you decide to queue

My hubby and I queued up at this stall for 1 hour and 40 minutes. It's crazy when you think about it, but our palate's curiosity won. Lo and behold, we have now officially eaten the best chicken rice to date! The chicken is authentic, delicious and soft. The rice is of good quality. The noodles and char siew are also really good. The best part is that its very affordable. $7 for a half chicken and $2 per plate with a generous portion of meat. I might not have the energy to queue that long again, but I'm really overjoyed to have eaten a local cuisine, well deserved of its Michelin winner

We had been waiting in the line for more than 40minutes just to taste this incredible food. we had a chance to see the chef of the kitchen as well. food was amazing,i have never taste anyting like this.

Affordable, tasty good experience. Ridiculous lines make this a 1 timer for me-- but glad i tried it

I have only one word for the food being served here…AMAZING! For only S$2 you get a gorgeous plate of juicy and fantastically tender chicken served on rice, which is probably the cheapest Michelin star meal you will ever eat.You do have to queue a very long time to get your food due to the popularity of this place so try to come during off-peak hours. Even then, I arrived about 10am on a Saturday and had to queue for almost 2 hours. The food is totally worth it though!Since I had to queue for so long I decided to buy a whole chicken (only 14S$!), char siu noodles and roasted pork on rice. All of this food only cost S$19 in total. The char siu was excellent and packed with flavour, the roasted pork had very tasty crackling and the chicken, the star of the place, had an incredibly soft texture and was absolutely delicious. It was everything I wanted and more. Obviously, I couldn’t finish everything in one sitting so I took it back home to share the joy with other people. Food is love! :

This little stand is on the second floor of the China Complex in China Town. Mom and I visited for my birthday and it was well worth it. I queued for about 40 minutes in total. As the line started to get bigger a little lady popped out to take orders as they only have a certain amount of chicken available for the day. When it's gone they shut up shop. I was lucky as the people behind me were turned away.It was worth the wait. We opted for simple Soya Sauce Chicken and Rice. 2 dollars for simple food from a Michelin Star Hawker, amaze balls. The chicken was moist and succulent, the rice light and fluffy and the sauce was too die for, extremely tasty.I advise that you go here during the week as this seems to be the quietest time. China town is very busy at weekends. We arrived just before 3pm

Went there yesterday for 2 hours queue, I don't complain about the queue, only 2 dollars meal with Michelin star, of course people should be expecting the queue. The entire food court is extremely unhygienic, rubbish everywhere, no air con, bad smells cover the whole area. The lady who gave me the rice, her finger touched my rice. Chicken and meat were both quite oily and I know there's MSG added in, which is illegal in Australia. My noodle is not even cooked, very chewy like Italian Al dente, also cold. I won't return again. But if u are traveling with 2 dollars budget for every meal, feel free to line up 2 hours in the smells because I couldn't find 2 dollars chicken in China or Australia anymore. And thanks for Michelin2016 singapore guide for wasting my time.

If you have never tried this chicken before and would like to try it now, be prepared to spend around 3 hours queuing for it, even on a weekday. We spent 2 hours 40 minutes before we could actually place our order. As we were so hungry by the time we placed our order, instead of ordering half chicken with green vegetables originally, we ordered a full chicken and green vegetables. The chicken was very tender and juicy, meat very lean. Two of us finished everything with a can of beer in 15 mins. The shop opens at 10:30 a.m. I asked one person waiting 15 in line when she started queuing, she said since 9:30 a.m. She got her food after 11. So plan your own schedule. If you can really wait, I suggest you come a few months later after the heat cools down a bit. After all, its only a chicken

I never actually got to taste the famous chicken and rice. We attempted the queue twice, the second time at 11:00 am in in the morning but gave up after waiting an hour and a half. You really need to be lining up at 9:00 am, having said this we experienced some excellent food from surrounding stalls

I've eaten at many food stalls during my visits to Singapore and have been very pleased. So, it was with great anticipation that I arrived in Singapore yesterday afternoon and immediately Ubered over to Chinatown to give the world't most affordable Michelin star restaurant a try. I arrived at 6:30 PM, but the stall was closed. I guess they were out of food. I ate at a couple of other stalls and had a very pleasant experience. I returned again today (Monday) at 1:00 PM and waited in line for 3 hours in 90 degree heat. Assuming that I was in for a huge treat, I ordered both the chicken with rice and chicken with noodles signature dishes. To put it bluntly, both dishes were inedible. Every so often when he needs more meat, the owner reaches up and grabs a chicken from a line in the front window of the stall. Then, he whacks the chicken with his cleaver into a bunch of small pieces and puts them on a bed of rice or noodles. A little sauce is added, along with a couple spoonfuls of peanuts. I simply could not eat my chicken, as it really contained no meat. It was 90% bone, marrow, gristle and other chicken parts. I was not about to sit at the table and try to figure out how to extract tiny morsels of chicken from this mess. I'm not sure if other people just stick all this by-product into their mouths, but I don't. The rice in the one dish was so-so. Not good enough to finish. The noodles in the other dish were chewy. I ate a few and gave up. I HATE giving bad reviews, but I think its fair to warn people who might otherwise wait in line for hours for a bad experience. Extremely disappointed

1 hour 50 mins wait time on Sunday morning.We ordered Soya Sauce chicken, BBQ char Siew and roasted pork.I love soy Sauce chicken the most; the texture was soft and tender. Taste better with noodles.BBQ char Siew and roasted pork were good too.Overall, worth waiting for food lovers. To avoid long wait time, do come earlier or avoid lunch peak hours.Affordable price with reasonable portion
5
We waited for one hour and a half on a friday so I guess we were lucky.We tried both the rice and noodle chicken, with a plate of mixed pork meat and we paid 8,50$. The taste is unique and very well worth the wait and the reputation. I also recommend that you get some food and drinks from other stands around which are also serving really tasty food for the same cheap prices

A very good restaurant in its category? Absolutely! Bear in mind this is no fine dining, it is a hawker store! Thumbs up to the cheapest Michelin Star meal ever! The only challenge to tasting this one Michelin Star meal is “Patience”. Food: Chicken cooked perfectly! The texture is unbeatable! No doubt worth a Michelin Star. Taste wise, not much chicken taste, apparently chickens in Singapore do not have the typical Chicken taste elsewhere. If given the chicken outside of Singapore, this will bring the meal up to another level. Noodle is fantastic! Recommend to try the noodle rather and the rice.Value: Unbeatable! World cheapest Michelin Star Meal! Environment: Hot and long queue in a hawker centre.Service: This is a hawker stall. Despite the long queue, it is actually serving quite fast.Tips: Trying going there off peak hours. Even for off peak hours, queue can be up to an hour. Just be patient

We've heard about the new Michelin ratings in Singapore and this being of the places that got recognized with one Michelin Star. Enjoy a meal for two for around $10 SGD for two. The secret is to Queue up at least an hour before they open. It took us about 1.5 hours to get our food. Very nice people as long as you know what you want. Go to another Stall and get some coffee or tea while you wait. be forewarned, don't get there at opening time. The queue went around the building and up the staircase by the time we got our food. The price, and the amount of food, it's well worth it. It's more of a tourist spot now, because of the new International accolade. Would I do it again? YES! but only if I got there early enough to avoid the long queue. Best thing to do and to avoid regret, order all meats (Chicken, pork ribs, roasted pork, and BBQ pork). You can order a combo plate to try everything. Go for the noodles, but a side of rice won't hurt either
5
This is a great little place to eat, located in an open-air food court in Chinatown. The owner/chef and his team work very hard and as quickly as possible to serve the long line of customers.HOWEVER:- the Michelin star is very much the main attraction, and the queue can get very long. We visited on 12 September, and arrived at 11:40. We queued in the heat for over three and a half hours - so only go there if you're prepared to wait. The queue itself is fairly good natured, and it's possible to leave for a few minutes at a time to get food or drink from the other nearby stalls- get there early. I'd gone there the evening before, and due to the popularity of the place, it's not unusual that they run out of food at 6 or 7pmThere are also some other great stalls nearby, so worth sampling the other food while you wai

Recently, there's been a buzz about the latest Michelin Starred Hawker Stalls being included in the inaugural of Singapore Michelin Guide 2016. Singapore is known for their hawker food culture and they take pride on it as one of the most affordable yet the most hygienic.Hong Kong Soya Sauce Chicken Rice & Noodle is one of the hawker stalls awarded with one Michelin Star.I purposely went to the place to have late lunch (hoping to avoid such long queue that can be as long as a 2 hr wait). Please be noted not to come to have dinner here because their food are depleted as early as 4pm. I went at around 3pm and queued for a little more than an hour just in time when they are handing out papers with your order on it (you can cancel but you cannot add, so be very sure of how much are you ordering). Too bad for those who have queued but was turned away and asked to come back another day as their food are finished. I intentionally bought half chicken, rice and noodles. I didn't queue for so long just to get a small portion.The service is fast and efficient. The stall owners are very nice, gentle and accomodating. I was only able to try the famed soya sauce chicken with rice (as I wanted to taste the black sauce they are pouring into it) and I also ordered noodles. The chicken is so tender, smooth on the palate, and bursting with flavor. I very much disagree with others saying that it is just so so. For someone like me who have tried so many chicken dishes, I can definitely say that this one is one of it's kind. Probably, only those that got distinctive taste may notice.Here's the best part. Value for money! A single portion of the Soya Sauce Chicken Noodle/Rice is priced at 2.80SGD only! Half chicken is priced at 7.00SGD! How good can that be?Location is quite central, in Chinatown which can be acessible from both Purple (North-East Line) and Blue (Downtown) MRT Lines. The Hawker centre itself can be quite stuffy especially in the mid day lunch time, I suggest to just find a good spot where there is more ventilation. SInce I went solo, while it is not bad, I think the experience could be more enjoyable with friends or family in tow

One of two Hawker stalls in Singapore with a Michelin Star for the Hong Kong Soya Sauce Chicken Rice. Went there twice and the only disappointment so far is that the Char Siew was sold out each time we went there.Don't go if you are in a hurry and don't go there if you don't like lining up in a queue.If you don't mind the above, then by all means go. The average queuing time is 30-60minutes. What you will get is the most amazing soya chicken rice available! The Hype Is Justified!! the aromatic rice, the beyond tender chicken, the soya sauce are a treat to your taste buds! And the price, for a Michelin Star dish, Sing$ 20? Sing $ 10? You'll never guess..all dished priced SIng$ 2.00 / 2.50. Fancy a whole chicken? Yours for Sing $ 14.00 really true! Any business man would have double or tripled the price after receiving the donors of a michelin star and all the media attention! But the stumble stall owner has left the prices unchanged! He travels by MRT to and from work. Can you imagine Gordon Ramsey in The Tube on his way to work??? No, me neither!My aim now is to go there even earlier as i have to try the Char Siew!! I don't mind queuing the extra time, because if it is as good as the chicken..

When we showed up at 9am, the owner was still preparing for the open and no one was queuing. When we returned around 10:15am, the queue was about 35 people deep. The queue swelled to about 70-80 before 11am. It took us 135 min of waiting to order the famous chicken rice with roast meat and BBQ pork. I would not do it every day but once a while, it is probably worth it.The chicken meat is very tender, the flavour is well balanced and BBQ sauce has a tinge of spiciness that makes it unique. What's more, the price is extremely reasonable. The locals are now lamenting that they used to wait only 30 min. Now it is two hours because 80-90% of the customers are tourists with big cameras. My advice from the experience: visit the stall at 9:30am and be the earliest batch of customers when the store opens at 10:45 am. Still, it takes you almost half a day for a lunch. Go as soon as possible and taste the original food before it follows the path of Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice, where the owner sold the biz to someone that mass produces the food and destroys the flavour and the brand along the way ..

After reading that this hawker stall got a Michelin star, I immediately include this in my itinerary. What a disappointment I got. We queued for four hours (talk about gullibility ) only to be told that their dumpling noodle and pork ribs rice are out of stock, bummer! Char siew is tough, bland and dry. You need a lot of sauce to give it some flavor! Although their soya chicken is very tender and juicy, it's definitely not worth a Michelin star, I think those people awarding the star have lower their standard now in terms of taste. I've tasted a lot better in other restaurants or hawker stalls, and definitely incomparable with Hong Kong's superb soya chicken. If not for their very cheap price, there is really nothing spectacular about this eatery. I felt I've wasted four hours of my life for this nonsense. To those tourists who haven't tried this hawker stall yet, good for you, because, it's definitely not worth wasting your precious travel time for this. And the whole complex is hot and dirty, even the paid toilets, they're filthy

As the 1st street food to earn a Michelin Star, this place is simply sit on the tip of Asian rich food culture. The waiting line during lunch is unbelievably long. You can end up with 3 hours waiting. So we opted to try it at 4pm instead. Although the line is reduced to only 45 min, the roasted & crunchy pork are gone along with its side dishes of oyster sauce vegetable and bean sprouts. We are limited to taste only a soya sauce chicken which is no problem at all. Remember? This is a place for soya sauce chicken rice & noodle!I ordered a noodle plate while my girlfriend ordered a rice one. Both are great. The look of each plate is so simple but the taste is very complex. It's so unreal that a guy & his wife cooking in a tiny square on a wet & old market like this place can create the food that has such a big bang of taste. The price is unbelievably cheap too. A chicken rice costs only SG$2.00, my noodle one is SG$2.50.It's one of a must-go place, if you have a chance to be in Singapore

On impulse, my wife told me she wanted to try the Michelin Starred hawker in Chinatown, and I readily obliged.I was slightly aghast when I saw the queue but not wanting to disappoint the wifey, I told her to take a seat and I will do the queueing. 15min into the queue I took note that the queue was moving too slowly and a quick mental calculation told me it will be around a 3 hour wait!Finally like completing a marathon, I managed to order my Soya Sauce Chicken. Prices are really affordable, 16 SGD for a full Soya Sauce Chicken, 2.50-3 SGD for a plate of chicken rice or noodles.The meat is succulent, full flavored with a slightly crispy and glossy skin. Rice and noodles were pretty average, I recommend to request more of the accompanying sauce for more flavor.Love the meat, hate the Queue.Personally it was too long a wait I had to deal with for any type of food. So it will have to be a long while before I come visit this fantastic stall again

My family eat Soya Sauce chicken almost once a week. It's a family favourite of ours in Sydney! So, of course I was keen to taste this now very famous hawker stall and Michelin Star rated Hong Kong Soya Sauce Chicken located within the Chinatown Complex in Singapore. This Michelin star rated stall takes no reservations and There are no fancy wait staff. We arrived at 5pm. What you will see is a bustling food court, steamy, hot and humid with centrally located fans for cooling. You will know where the stall is because of the long line of people you will be confronted with on arrival. Here you will see people from all walks of life and hear many languages, waiting to taste the soya sauce chicken. Be prepared to join them in the wait. We did food runs whilst we were waiting, sending someone out to grab an "entree" before the main meal. Why not!! You are surrounded by food and it's so cheap!! We waited almost one hour. Thank goodness for the Siu mai, chicken feet and copious amounts of sugar can juice to keep us cool. When we finally arrived for our time to order we were told there was only 2 legs left only enough for two and no more" all sold out". Damn now we had to share with our friends. We watched the 10 metre line if people as their faces slumped, when the lady called "no more chicken, no more nothing". We purchased the last two morsel sized plates, only to have the lady tried over charge us by $1. Interesting seeing as though the plate did not come with the usual condiments. My partner did bring this to her attention because he was quite peeved and probably hot from waiting for so long. It would have been courteous to let the long line of people know they were running out of food. The verdict: the chicken was succulent, rich, deep and flavoursome. It was delicious. It would have been even nicer with the usual extras. Would I wait an hour? Yes, why not! After all it's Michelin Star without the hefty price tag. Is it the best soya sauce chicken we have have had? Mmmmm it was pretty good but not sure about "the best". ( note: soya sauce chicken and rice is priced at $2:00 per bread sized plate) Tip: go with a bunch of people and make it fun. Have a couple wait in line and have others run out and grab food from the surrounding food stalls. It will be like a tapas style event whilst your waiting in line and won't make it feel so long and dreary.

I went to Chinatown Complex to have my lunch today and the queue at Hong Kong Soya Sauce Chicken Rice & Noodles was amazingly long. Among the queue were many tourists chatting excitingly about the food. There was at least 50 people in the queue. I had tried the soya sauce chicken rice and noodles from this stall before they attained the Michelin award and I got my food within 30 minutes then. The price of the half chicken and whole chicken is about 20-30 percent cheaper than other popular stalls. Their chicken is tender and juicy and the gravy is tasty and fragrant. However I will not have the patience and time to patronize them now especially when this hawker center is so hot and stuffy
4
Although one has to prepare to wait for around 2-3 hours, the food is really great and the texture of the char siu (pork) is so tender it melts in your mouth, bursting with rich flavors! The chicken is really good too. For just SG$3, I got to have a good-sized customized char siu and chicken combination with rice and peanuts.P.S. Go there around 10-10.30AM so that the queue is still not long. If there is anyone who will plead/ask you to buy food for them, politely say no. As I had experienced a short-lived quarrel between two people when I was lining up. Nevertheless, the food is great
5
We asked a taxi driver for local food and he brought us to china town for breakfast. He told us to look for this place in the centre but we would see the queue. He was not wrong :) , we spent the next 30 mins chatting with really nice locals while we waited. When you reach the top there is a small shop front packed with produce and a man wielding a cleaver and fast movements. We had the chicken, char Sui (pork) and Asian greens all for $7.50 sgd. it was beautiful, tender and tasty. Washed down with soursop juice (try it it's fab).Michelin stared food in very relaxed environment, just perfect. Be prepared to queue ,when sold out that's it so get there early. Try the coffee in the complex as well as the juices. I would go back

If you have heaps of time and you are a Michelin star chaser then by all means. Be prepared to wait in line for up to 3 hours (which was the amount of time for us from the escalators to the front of the line on Saturday around 11:30am). But if you want equally as good food without a long wait then there is an abundance of food in the Chinatown Complex hawker foodcourt without the ridiculous wait.The food itself was good no doubt but a little underwhelming. At SGD$2 for chicken and rice or $2.50 for chicken and noodles, $7/$14 half/whole chicken, it is great value. However, would not do it again, especially since it is hot and there is no air-conditioning in this centre! Only one guy chopping and making noodles so it is not the most efficient set up

I heard from my friends that this place was already famous of its good and cheap chicken rice before it became a michelin restaurant. As a food lover, I decided to visit this place in the weekend with my friends. We arrived at 11:30 AM and at that time the queue was already long. We had waited for more than 2 hours. You should bring some snack and water with you. In case you want to give up, you can find a lot of good restaurants in that area. I saw a lot of people left the queue. The question is: is it worth to wait for more than two hours? I think it's worth to wait but 30mins is enough. The michelin star makes this place well-known and always crowded. But.. I have to say that it's not easy to find a delicious chicken rice as same price. The rice is sticky, smells really good with some special ingredients. You should mix rice with the sauce. Noodle is also good but I don't like because it has too much oil. Although the price is very cheap, you shouldn't order too much. Chicken is cooked really well, it is soft and you feel the flavor inside. Soya sauce is balance, not too light or too strong. I recommend to order one chicken (14$) with two or three dishes of rice (0.5$ for each) and one vegetable (3-4$). This set is enough for three people. There are so many type of chicken rice on the world and we can't say which one is the best. Everyone has his or her own feeling and taste. For me this one is a really good place for lunch and dinner except that it is crowned and the queue is too long. If you can stand for it and really wanna try michelin star restaurant then do it, but should visit it in afternoon or early morning. At lunch time this place is crowned and really hot, it would make you tired and you couldn't enjoy the food in a good mood.

I last ate here in Dec 2015 and there has always been a queue of up to 30 minutes even during mid day. It was one of the cheapest soya sauce chicken ($14 whole/$7 half) around and was decently good, but never thought it would have claimed an accolade from Michelin! There are so many equally good or better chicken rice or hawker stalls or restaurants that deserved recognition so it certainly didn't speak well of Michelin in its inaugural guide for Singapore. In all fairness a Bib Gourmand would have been more appropriate imho and certainly not worth queuing for hours just for the star
3
It is the cheapest and I am sure the most simple 1 Michelin Star in the world. Yes the chicken rice is exceptional good and with 2.5 S$ dirt cheap. At the moment, as it is still new, I mean the rating, the queue is long and I waited 1 hour. As I was in the area I thought its a must do. I would go again any time but only if the queue is a 1/4 as long. Unfortunately the trays they had, had been very very dirty. So just don't take a tray
5
Tender drumstick which was full of flavour. Absolutely delicious and at a bargain price of 2 sgd per plate or 14 sgd for whole chicken. Unfortunately the queue during Saturday at around 2pm was about an hour long. Do queue for it if you have the time as it was worth it
4
Probably the 1st and only 1-Star Michelin chicken noodles and rice stall in Singapore, located in Chinatown Complex.We went there today on a Monday and queued for 2.5 hours from 11.30am - 2pm. The queue was very very long, snaking 2 alleys away from the stall. Probably more than 60 pax in the queue when we were there.. But i will definitely not queue up again as it's not worth wasting 2.5 hours just to sample the soya sauce chicken ! But at S$2.50 a plate, it's definitely value-for-money and the cheapest food you can buy for a 1-Star Michelin F&B outlet. Will be better if the stall could provide soup to go with the soya sauce chicken as we got thirsty after savouring down all the mouth watering dishes... 
5
This is your simple yet traditional Soya sauce meal.serves cooked soya beans as the side,something you don't really see.  Prices start at 2SGD,newly awarded cheapest Michellin star snatching The title away from Tim Ho Wan.cant find 2sgd meal in Sg too.  My kind of hawker-ish food.cheap,simple and taste of Dota sauce.Yummmm!  Queued for 95 mins from 1030am sunda
5
After queuing for 30 minutes I ordered my Soy Chicken & Noodles, at $2.50, its one of the cheapest and best meals I have ever had. I returned the next days for more.
4
The textures of the noodles are springy and the soya sauce chicken meats are juicy and tasty. The sauce is their trademark. You can even slurp it up
Their serving portion is also sufficient for an average adult.
3
Long queue to get this, estimate 20-30 minutes queue by the side of the stall, enough to get your sweaty on a good day. Soya chicken noodles is good, tried the ribs as well which was tasty and tender. Roasted pork was average. But whether it's worth the time and effort to queue, that's subjective as it's not exactly something great. If you get a few in front packing 20-30 packs, the wait will be extremely long
5
Wow, the long Q really blew me off. Was waiting up to almost 45mins and realized that they had a lot of soya sauce chickens. It explains why they didn't turn away the Q. Price wise, half chicken at $7, whole chicken at $14, can't complain. Cheap. When my friend & I sank our teeth into it for the first time, it was not bad. Acceptable. Worth trying
5
Anyone who complains that's it's expensive to eat good food in Singapore needs to come find this place. For $2.50 I ate possible one of the best meals I've eaten in other 8 months in Asia. The chicken was so soft it literally melts in your mouth. The soya sauce is sweet and sticky and components the meal perfectly. Yes you will have to wait in a que. Yes the que could possibly be quite long. Yes. It is absolutely 100% worth it.
4
The soya sauce chicken is nice and tender. For a whole chicken, it cost only SGD14. For great taste and stomach satisfactions. However, please be ready to queue for at least for more than half an hour to enjoy a plate of nice soya sauce chicken rice. The roasted pork also taste very nice, it has the taste in my childhood memories
5
If you want to taste soya sauce chicken, which is cheap and good in Singapore, you should try this stall at China Town Hawker Center on Smith Street #02-127. Selling at $7 for half a chicken or $14 whole, it is considered “cheap”. You can also buy smaller portions on plate with rice and chicken at $2,50 - $4. BUT you need to queue (usually 30 minutes). All worth the time spent for the soft and juicy chicken. Besides chicken, they also have BBQ pork which is also satisfying.Stall is open daily (except Wednesdays) from 10.30am to 7pm (Earlier on Saturdays and Sundays from 9am).To get there, take the MRT to China Town NE4. Exit B and walk to Smith Street - walk 5 minutes to the hawker center
4
I have taken my leave yesterday and purposely to buy this soya chicken. This is the second time I bought this. The chicken meat was so soft and the gravy is nice too. The queue there is almost need at least half an hour on weekday. I cannot imagine if is on weekend then the queue will be more longer. The char siew also very nice. Now a day is quite difficult to find soya soy chicken rice selling $2.00 per plate. The chicken meat they have given is not less than those selling $3.00 per plate
5
To set the record straight, this is not a restaurant. It is a food stall located in Chinatown Complex -- a hawker centre. Be dressed to take the heat.On weekdays they open in the morning at about 10ish and on weekends 9ish -- do be prepared to wait in queue even if you are there on time. Be forewarned: For those who join the queue after 11am (weekdays) or 10am (weekends), the wait will very probably be 45mins to an hour. To me, it is well worth the wait but I choose to be in the queue before then.Personally enjoyed the tasty, tender and juicy soya sauce chicken. The chicken is of a good size hence it is not chunky and tough. The soya sauce is not too sweet nor too salty -- perfect to me. Just simply delicious.The Char siew is tender, juicy and tasty like the chicken. Be brave -- ask for meat with abit of fat.As for the roasted pork, if you like the skin thick and crispy, you are at the right place. I prefer the skin thin and crispy.This is the soya sauce chicken that I will hop onto the NEL from Punggol to satisfy my craving

The queue is always never ending whenever I passed by. So, I was curious and wanted to try since the queue was shorter today. The price is cheap given the portion of my order. But the taste is just acceptable and nothing to short about. I won't queue again
