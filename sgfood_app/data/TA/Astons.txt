Decent steak and offering quite a small range of western style menu. This restaurant requires one to pay before given seats. Price can be quite expensive.
4
Choosing your main course includes two side dishes that are absolutely delicious! Best are pasta salad and potato wedges
4
A raining afternoon, hungry stomach after being rejected at another restaurant because it was full as I did not make a booking. Desperately looking for a place for a decent meal. Headed to Aston. As usual, the steak never fails. Simple, reasonably priced and satisfied.
4
Much better than McDonald's and at a similar price. Strange to pay for a meal before you actually have it though, so you obviously order before being seated.
3
Although their food is above average, because of their wish to manage staffing requirements, they will take orders before allowing you to enter. This results in long queues at lunch or dinner time.

Visited Astons and found the quality of Food to be inconsistent. For example, we ordered 2 Ribeye steak medium but one was too well done while the other was rare with traces of blood. The size of the 2 cuts were drastically different with one much thicker. What was worst was that all the while there was a housefly which flew around and landed on our straws and plates. The staff didnt do anything and finally the supervisor came and just said loudly that they will call the pest control. On the whole a disappointing experience as Astons is not only expensive now but quality of Food and service has dropped

We like Astons due to the no frill western food at neighbourhood locations. It is fast, tasty and affordable. Note that the prices include GST and there is no service tax. Astons outlet at Sembawang shopping centre is located in the basement. We went there for Friday lunch. The place was not busy. Portion size were decent and food came quickly to the table.

Aston is a must visit place if you are hungry and are looking for a moderately priced restaurant. One can order a main dish along with 2 sides of your own choice. The menu is limited but the food tastes great. One main dish is enough for two people. The service is quick even when the restaurant is crowded
5
We always eat here. Because the food is good, the people are good, the ambiance is good which is best if you are with your friends. worth the price. It's not as expensive if you go fine dining or eating in a steak house. The price is reasonable, I'm telling you and you will be satisfied with the serving. Sometimes, on different occasions or on other branch, it takes time for our orders to arrive. We always go to the one at Centerpoint, along orchard. They have buffet there (but not including the main dish). So after you order your main dish, YOU CAN ALREADY START EATING! No need to keep your hunger and wait for your order. Will definitely eat there again when I visit Singapore

Came here for our late dinner. There were still a lot of in coming customers. Despite waiters looked tired, they still very willing to serve their customer in a very polite and professional manner. Portion of the meals were big. Tried their Escargot.. well-done. Perhaps the kitchen was too busy I guess , the fried chicken and grilled fish were not up to standard - fried chicken being over-fried and grilled fish tasted bitter. Side dishes were fine. Price - fairly good price for the portion.
5
Just in time for dinner, we went to Ashton Steak House that is located at Bugis Point Center. A tasty roast beef and a glass of Beer float really made my day.
5
Was down at Sentosa the other day and was looking to have lunch there. Seemed like the Restaurant is either gone or being renovated.
5
I just love the fish on their menu. It always taste so great. and for whatever reason, it doesn't taste all right, then just inform the staff. They replace it readily. Great customer service!
5
Food is usually given in large portions and cooked to perfection. What I like best is how cheap it is as compared to rival restaurants. I have been to expensive restaurants and this is still the best tasting. :)
4
My first visit to the Sembawang shopping centre was enjoyable. The pork chop was good. I especially like the side dish Mac & Cheese.
But on my second visit , the pork chop was dry and hard, a bit disappointed.
3
Steak and food I would say average. Service is ok and prices is average. The strange thing is that you order and pay before you sit! This doesnt sound like a steak house.
1
the staff were just stood around talking and looked bored. we had to ask for everything. the steak wasnt as nicely cooked either.
4
When we felt hungry at Resorts World Sentosa, we saw the long line outside this joint and decided to give it a try. It was worth the wait. The place has a nice ambience. Staff are helpful & courteous. Food is really tasty. We had some Iced Lemon Tea to cool off. For lunch we had Crispy Fried Chicken with Corn on the Cob & French Fries as one meal & Prime Tenderloin with Potato wedges & tasty rice as another. Price is reasonable & I will surely visit again to try out other stuff.. if I'm in Sentosa
4
This is the place where many youngest like to patronize. The food portion is big and the price is cheap. The food is ordered and paid for at the counter near the entrance. They served a variety of chicken, fish, pasta as well as cold and hot sides. Do look out for occasional offers.
4
The reason I gave it that title is because we looked it up on the internet and found this great place, great menu with such a lot of variety at great prices ...... when we went to look for the place, it was quite isolated (we are talking about Sentosa resorts after all), it was canteen like, but the food was pretty good. My husband and I had steaks which were cooked absolutely right, my mashed potatoes and his onion rings surely came out of a pack, but altogether for the price was great.. Funnily enough, they have red wine but not white wine and nobody could explain why
5
I super love their steak. well marinated. their side dishes are good too. my personal favourite is their coleslaw
5
Pricing point is fair compared to other restaurants in Sentosa. To pay such price for western food and taste good, it's good to have your lunch there.
4
Their meats are seasoned & tender good for the price you pay, but beware of long queue outside.
I don't recommend their express stalls at coffee shops, I had tried it before, meets/veggies & condiments are not freshly cooked seems they just reheated it.
5
Perfectly cooked steak at a good price :) Better to go a bit early than the planned dinner time since there are queues sometimes.
4
My partner and I loved their steak. We also can't get enough of the baked potato. My vegies are also good especially the sweet baby carrots. My first time in Astons is just on our block near a hawker center but still there is no difference in terms of food and taste. Astons in Sentosa is also warm and nice (better than the one on our block). It is also affordable considering you get to eat that good. Much worth the price

We dined in today around 6 am... food is ok except for 1 of my steak I ordered medium well but I think they gave me medium rare.. I inform the manager so he faster change.. everything is ok except for 1 staff very rude name david.. he just standing beside the cashier then we ask him if he can takr photo because he have some friends from overseas but they way he talk is very rude.. he just say im busy I ask my colleagues and faster turnback. . He just standing its 6.30 that time I think they only have 5 tables.. I know aston no service charge but it doesnt mean u need to be very rude.. such a disgrace to your company.. im also working on the service line we dont train our staff that way.. we are always a fan of aston katong and suntec.. I will not come to this outlet anymore.
5
Got here by mistake, ordered a tenderloin a only paid 30 dollars, to my surprise the steak was wonderful and it's very affordable. Since then anytime I think of eating a tenderloin, I always go to Astons and their service is very good, also they already know me so the service is even better everytime I go there. Appreciate that their staff recognize when they have a loyal customer

Went for the first time for early dinner at Suntec Branch, 630pm, 5 pax.Service - you order at the counter and make payment before sitting down. My fellow diners had been before since their opening, and commented that our food took VERY long to arrive on this trip. Staff are decently attentive, we did have to wave our hands a fair bit before they came over. A friend who arrived slightly late also had to wait 10min to have his order taken, they simply left the order counter unmanned.Food - ordered the black pepper chicken with 2 sides (fries & onion rings). Very reasonable pricing at SGD9.80. We also ordered a sausage platter to share, which had a nice selection of 4 different sausages, SGD16-ish if I recall correctly. The chicken came warm, as did the fries and onion rings; slightly disappointing as it wasn't piping hot. However, serving size was commendable and very standard taste (suspect it was bottled black pepper sauce poured on the chicken); quality was OK. I think if it had been served hot straight out of the fryer, the onion rings may not have been slightly soggy as they were.Friends ordered the double chicken main with varying sides (mash, potato salad, salad) which were also 'OK'. They also mentioned that the food used to be much better, and that standards had dropped over the years. I have no reference point so it was an enjoyable meal for me.Worth a visit for decent western food if your wallet is looking too slim

premise - mapletree business parklocation - good and plenty of car parkservice - just average: non greeting stafffood - make sure that you order one doneness level UP: you like medium, ask them to cook it medium well. if you want a sure fire meal, get the fried stuff, nothing can go wrong with fried food. :)price - very reasonable. let's face it, this is a normal steak house, so don't compare it with other steak houses?verdict - good for goers who are not that picky on service and quality of food. let's admit it, we go to astons b'cos they are fast and also very affordable!! :) so please save us from all the complains about 'quality' / 'location' / 'service standards'. we pay for what we get. :

This is probably the worst Astons' Specialities outlet.We ordered plate of Spicy Chicken Spaghetti and Ribeye X'tra cut (medium doneness).The food were served promptly, but when we highlighted to a waiter that we do not have our utensils, he started to show impatience towards us. The spaghetti was half cooked and full of oil.As for the ribeye, it came almost as a rare steak so we had it recooked. Then, it came back as an almost burnt steak.It was a truly disappointing dinner
5
I always go to Aston's Bugis+ .They have good Chargrill Steak. You can also ask for extra gravy. Good service!
4
Had lunch here twice. Great side dishes. Restaurant was spacious and clean (in comparison, the outlet at Katong seemed so cramped).
5
Cost was good and the food excellent so where others take your money these guys deliver you smiles. Family oriented and only a little walk away from other areas that charge the max.
5
Went there for diner and it was value for money $15.00 gets you steak and two side dishes. Service was very quick, drinks came out straight away followed by our meal which was excellent best meal we have had in Singapore
1
imagined you order a set meal with soft drink , was served with main course followed by appettizer then SOFT DRINK
1
Never will I ever go near Astons. Fake!! Trying to run a restaurant in a coffee shop. Eating a lamb chop in a hot, dusty and noisy coffee shop cost me $21.90. I could have a better deal in better joints like Jack's place.Singapore is really the most expensive in the world, no doubts
5
We have recently stayed on Sentosa and were so happy to discover Astons. Our family of 2 adults and 2 teenagers all had meals (which come with a choice of 2 x side dishes each), drinks and the total was less than $60. The service was fast and friendly and all meals were enjoyed. We visited another night and found the experience to be just as good. It is a little bit hidden around the back but worth looking for. Try the lime chicken dish, beautiful ! My husband had the ribs which was a huge dish and he really enjoyed them. Definately recommended

My kids love Aston Food. We have eaten many Aston dishes around Singapore. So when we were at Sentosa, we went round hunting for Aston. It took us quite a while to find the location as it was right at the almost end of the shopping stripes. We were starved by then. Luckily the service did not take too long. Despite having very hungry stomach, we didn't enjoy the food as much. The food is quite blend and little overcooked.So when we were there again in Aug13, we give Aston a miss. So can you
1
Avoid. Bad service and no clue about customer care.They also cheat. Requested no seasoning on fries, meat or anythings. They served with seasoning. So send back. They served again within 5 minutes after washing the food with water (?!), wiping sauce of the meat, and a very bad attempt wiping salt of the fries, but they insist they did not do that (remainder of sauce still on meat and corn was clearly just washed and mushy, salt still on fries).Quality of what is served is average at best, even before abusing the food.Also, I and my daughter was to meet my wife and her sister in front of Astons. But I lost my phone. So I went in to ask if I could call her (local call) and make very clear that we'd eat there. They say they don't have a phone. Then other customers came in. They were quickly to ignore me, point the others to a table and then asked me "what you want?". I repeated the question. "No, no phone here". And he walked away.Luckily outside at the first passer by I asked the same thing, and of course no problem to make a call using their mobile phone. As we still wanted steak, we still went in, only to be disappointing by a lying server and below par quality of food.I expected Astons would say: "Of course Sir. Maybe we don't have a desk phone but use this mobile. Sorry to hear you lost your wife and phone. We're happy you chose to meet and eat here.". But none of that. I've eaten at other Astons often, but at this outlet they seem to cut corners. Probably because they assume all visitors there are tourists and one-time visitor. Too bad they damage the brand name for whole Singapore

After a day at Universal and the aquarium we stopped for dinner at Astons due to their prices. The menu was quite substantial and the prices were very good $8-$40 for a main. We had the rib eye and the hickory chicken. Both were very nice. The rib eye was cooked perfectly! Very hard to find restaurants that do a good medium rare steak. We paid $28 for two mains and a Pepsi ($1.20). Amazing. If you're looking for a cheap meal and not fussed on fancy stuff this is the place for you
1
Our first and last time at Astons. The restaurant was bursting at the seams. We waited almost 90 mins for food with 3 small children. When it cames it was badly charred, tough and tasteless.
4
We found this hotel on the last night at Sentosa, but wished we had of found it sooner. Great value meals, but unfortunately they don't serve dessert!
4
Took our dinner during CNY. Food price is very reasonable compared to other resturants nearby. Nice food too. Recommended
4
For under 20$ you are already able to get a well cooked steak. Astons knows how to handle meat and is always good for a steak for dinner.
4
Expect to see a long queue at Aston, however, somehow, the queue was much shorter than what we expected. Maybe the outlet is tucked away in a corner and away from the main areas. Food quality and service never disappoint. Great value for money, especially the prime and expensive Sentosa area.
4
Steaks here are good and reasonably priced. Won't get anything this value on other restaurant for steak in Singapore. And good steak at that, not the type as Ruth's cris or Morton's yet good.Come here you'll find it reasonably priced with decent ambience.Saturday we tried to eat here but the q is long and Sunday still long but got in. So come earlier than the usual eating time
3
Not as crowded as the Malaysia food street, food portion is good for the price paid relative to the restaurants in this area. The service staff allowed us to take a table for 8 at a corner although we only have 5 as I requested, as they understood that it's better for our 3 young children. The funny thing is however the service staff informed that there were a number of items on the menu that were not available as they ran out of the raw materials. Like spaghetti, corn, French fries, etc. that left us with limited choice and that showed that there were problems with the purchasing unit
4
This is one of the eating places at Resorts World Sentosa where you don't have to pay through your nose for decent foodfare. Their steaks as always are great, service is fast, and ambience is relaxing, fare from the maddening noise from the plaza in front of Universal Studios
4
this is the place to get cheap food and yet you can sit comfortably in restaurant settings.1 set of western food (eg, BBQ chicken cutlet) + 2 sides costs abt $8.Soft Drinks cost $1.50.Very near Universal studio. U can grab a meal here. It is very much cheaper than dining in USS. The food is not bad too
5
The steaks are fantastic and always value for money, which explains the long queues at their outlets. I have visited Aston Specialities at Centrepoint, RWS, Changi Airport T1 and Suntec City. Their service has never failed on me. My husband and I always order the Prime Ribeye cut / extra cut and we always leave with happy tummies and smiles on our faces
