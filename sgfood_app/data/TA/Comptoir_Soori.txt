Must try the cod and the duck rillette, very very good. Would consider this to be one of the best Western food experiences we've ever had in Singapore.

Nice wine bar, good ambience and wide selection of wines with decent french food to go along. The food menu was limited though and could be better if it was a full fledged kitchen with more nibbles/finger food selections. Good attentive service throughout.

If you enjoy having a glass of wine with your friends or partner, this place should be on your top list.
You will find genuine French food, served by lovely staff and most important... amazing wines!

I stumbled across this gem of a place the weekend before wandering around Keong Saik Rd and stopped to enjoy a charcuterie and cheese platter and a few glasses of white wine. The food and experience was so good that it warranted a second visit for dinner. The ambience is a quiet, sophisticated cool with walls lined with a nice selection of wine and various products available for sale. I ordered the hanger steak, 1 glass of of Pomerol red, chocolate cheesecake for dessert which totaled $73.70 (incl. GST). C'est si bon. Oui. I'll be back

We had dinner for two. The cold meat plate was okay, some meat was a bit dry but some was tasty. I ordered beef cheek for main, it was simple and nice. My partner order "roast chicken" which was a mess, it was more like a soft tomato and capsicum bomb as opposed to a crispy spring chicken. Service was good.

A perfect hideout from the Singapore heat is here!. My wife and I enjoyed the friendly but efficient hospitality first by ordering craft beers and a fantastic gourmet charcuterie in the bar area at the front of the architect designed space. The restaurant carries a large range of French wines and a carefully chosen selection of other new world wines. In addition there is a small selection of gourmet food items for sale to take home. We decided to move to the small dining area at the rear for our main courses. It is a cosy, inviting space and we selected two mains and a wine match that our host suggested. The meals were a delicious representation of unfussy French cooking, moreish and full of rich butter, cream, garlic and meaty flavours. For a couple or small group this place is a real find. It's in a cool part of town and feels like it's off the beaten track, a real locals hangout. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed

Comptoir Soori offers a large selection of boutique wines from any region in France and some selections from Italy and Spain.The staff is really helpful and knowledgeable, which is good as most of the wines are unknown to us.The food menu is simple and classic but very well prepared, nice charcuterie platter. Special mention for the beef cheek and the duck confit, the best I had so far..The prices are sweet considering the quality of the food/wine and service.A great place if you have a friend gathering..

Of all the restaurants in Singapore this little gem is by far a favorite for me. It is relaxed, has very reasonably priced wine that is expertly recommended and simple high quality dishes. If you enjoy cheeses or duck rillettes, Comptoir Soori is a great choice! I find myself returning to this quaint friendly establishment on a regular basis and cannot find fault. The management and staff are passionate, attentive and very helpful
