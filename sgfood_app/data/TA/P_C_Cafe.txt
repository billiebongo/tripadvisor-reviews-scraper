Stopped in for coffee and cake. The cake is absolutely off the charts, delicious 100 times over. The cake was golden banana butterscotch cake with ice cream. Try it you will be back for more.

Really like the way that they decorate the restaurant, style, color which is mixed between old and trendy style. Food portion quite big.

If you happen to be on the orchard road and wanted someplace to calm down and hide away from the shopping madness then look no further than this. Google direction are pretty easy to find this, best view is definitely the corner balcony.Food: ComfortDessert: Okish Coffee: GoodWinner: Pasta & Truffle frie

The transformation of Dempsey Barracks from a military stronghold into a food and shopping precinct has been very successful. You can buy interesting furniture, or Singapore's best meat (from Hubers), and then follow it up with a delicious lunch at PS Cafe, where I have now eaten on three occasions. If you arrive after midday, you will probably have to wait for up to 20 minutes because it is such a popular venue, but the wait is worthwhile and the food deliciou

I always go here because of the dessert "golden banana butterscotch cake" and every time I go it's like I have orgasm but I've tried their truffle shoestring fries for the first time and for me it's salty. I may suggest they put more cheese on it and less salt but even though I will return cos I like the atmosphere and the other food. One more thing, they have this queue machine I've tried it and I received sms saying that they will call me when it's our turn to seat down but no one did it's kinda disappointing because we need to go back just to find out that there is a available table for two
