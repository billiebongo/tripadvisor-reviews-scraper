Great view over the skyline. So windy as well. Food was not bad and beer selection is quite a few. Though the beers taste similar. Server Anthony was thoughtful when he offered outdoor option when it was available.
5
Love coming here. The service is fantastic and so is the food. Love the selection of craft beer and the fact they are making it on site. Great concept. Amazing view of the city while sipping on a drink!!
4
Food is expensive but the rest is OK! Pilsner is awesome! Superb!!!!!!!! Staffs are cool. Noisy restaurant. Nonetheless its a place to go!
5
Great view for lunch. the sunday roast menu is great too, especially the fish. for sunday lunch, it isnt crowded too.
4
A little tricky to find the restaurant, food are overpriced for that small portion of main courses, beer were superb especially Pilsner but I guess we are mainly paying for the view.
4
This is a perfect location. Excellent view of Marina Bay and the city. The ambience is great and I recommend it for anyone who is visiting Singapore. Thanks to Ethan Ong for his excellent service. We will return...
5
Grate food, slow roasted lamb, drinks- home brewed beer and service. We had a lovely time and they were very helpful.
5
I booked a table for 5 people but many more friends arrived for my birthday dinner. The staff were very accommodating, adding several tables to seat my party of 12 - despite the night being fully booked!!We all had dinner and drinks - sea bass and shared meat dishes were very delicious and of a high standard. Delicious beers on tap and unique cocktails!! A must try!! I will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu and enjoy the great view
5
I am impressed with the selection of the semi buffet lunch as it is one of the best among the best for vegans. I love the quiet afternoon as the lunch crowd starts to disappear. Perfect place to chill over coffee or small meetings. A must visit in Singapore!
5
We ate here on a whim, having seen it as we walked past on our way to the Marina Bay Sands. What a great decision that was. We got a table no problem, service was swift and friendly and the food was excellent. After dinner, we moved to the bar area and sampled some of the ales that are brewed on the premises. They were all excellent!I'll definitely return next time I'm in Singapore
5
We went there to meet friends. We The beer they brew and serve is excellent and has the right strength you would expect. THe bites are well sellected and good.
5
Food was good with excellence service crew. A nice place to hang out with a nice view overlooking Marina Bay Sands.
2
The view was totally wasted given the standards of the foods served. Unlikely to be back despite the fantastic view.
5
I ordered the steak from the lunch set, and it was very juicy and tender. The buffet spread at the ploughman's table is extensive, and I was nearly unable to finish my main course after going through the large buffet spread.
5
Stunning. I asked the restaurant for a table with a view as parents were in town. Table delivered as did the food! Shared a steak between us and was cooked to perfection!
5
The views from this restaurant are amazing, and the food and drinks match. It is a micro brewery were the staff have excellent knowledge of there drinks and nothing is too much trouble. The food we had was delicious, it was expensive but we think it was well worth the money. Plenty of dishes to choose from and great atmospher
5
If you wanna enjoy a stunning view of the Marina Bay & grab a local brewed beers, this is the place for you. Almost every time when I'm in Singapore, I'd visit there - from having a drink to dining there. You wouldn't be disappointed with the experience there
5
Arguably the best view in Singapore. A great place to spend a weekend afternoon sharing a few drinks with friends. Beer paddles are loved by beer enthusiasts. SIt outside and take in views of Marina Bay Sands, Esplanade theatres and parts of Colonial SIngapore. Not the cheapest option but a good option - not to be missed for a couple of hours soaking up the ambience
2
I have dined here before for lunch with girlfriends so decided to take my husband for lunch. The view was spectacular, however our food was not enjoyable...We ordered the bread which had no flavor and spongey, almost stale like. We ordered the cheese and meat platter. The cold cuts meat did not taste of a premium quality at all. The curried pickles were nice. We also had the chicken sliders. They were not only oily but full of fat.....We had the sizzling prawns. They were tasteless. Its almost like none of the food was seasoned at all...Disappointed on this visit
5
If you’re looking the join the mile high brew club, level 33 is a must. Nestled like a dragons roost overlooking the Singapore harbour, level 33 boasts exquisite cocktails and Merlion-sized pints to satiate the thirstiest of travelers. The view alone is worth a million bucks but you’ll be pampered with excellent and personable service and exquisite deserts. A must-do if spending a night or longer in Singapore.
4
This is a must do once in Singapore. Enjoy the most beautiful view over Marinabay and downtown Singapore. Needless to say that you should order one of the home made brews and enjoy.
4
If you are in the Bay Area you have to go to level 33 for a drink. Their own beer is a nice surprise and enjoyed from the open terrace overlooking the Bay Area you cannot have a better setting.
5
The food is excellent and view is a bonus. Good for business meetings or just chill night. Kids are allowed. It can be crowded at times. Service okay.
4
This place serves a tasty main course and the side dish buffet line is wonderful as I love the selection of cheese and cold cuts.
Service is good and servers are generally attentive.
I don't mind going back there again for another meal!
4
Went for company dinner. The overall experience is pretty good. View and service is great. The food is average. Can be improved.
5
Great food, nice view, hospitable service. Celebrated my wife’s birthday here and the staff was nice enough to sing her a birthday song at our table!
5
This place has a great view of singapore's famous landmark. Good place to bring your friends and have dinner or drinks. Make sure you come in early since it gets full easily.
4
Scenic view of Marina Bay. Best time to go is before dinner to have a drink at the terrace to enjoy the view from day to night. Prefer dinner and evening bar snacks to lunch.
5
Settled in for a night on my own. There is a great bar set up in front of the window where you have the view and not feel too out of place while you take in some quality beers (indeed three other solos cycled through during the evening as well as me!). Tried their Bock as pictured - a great toffee oaked beer. Had the gnocchi with lamb and cranberries which was also very good. An enjoyable night, spent with a great book, beer and pasta
3
Have been several times and always enjoyed it for a beer (they brew their own) and the view. Last time we went for lunch, and the service was really bad. Several people around us were complaining angrily. We just laughed it off, but I wouldnâ€™t go back during peak hours.
4
The view of the restaurant was awesome! Good spot for taking loads of photos. The staff were very friendly and the food was served very quickly! Overall an enjoyable experience.
4
We are beer connoisseurs, and seek out brewpubs wherever we travel. Level 33's outside tables have the most amazing views of the harbor, that it is worth visiting even though their beer was no better than OK. Did I mention AMAZING views!
5
Great table,views, not too busy, excellent wines (good value) and great menu/portions.
Only criticism was that the food goes cold quickly in the air-con
5
Amasing view, variety of crafted beer, tasty food. Good quality and service at reasonable price. Definitely recomend.
5
They brew there own beer here and it doesn’t disappoint, really great after a long day walking in the heat. The beers are reasonably priced considering the views you get with it and compared to some over rooftop bars. Views are stunning.
5
I went with my colleagues during lunch hour. We decided to try their Executive Set Luch which is priced at S$42 per person. Comes with a very good selection of appetisers and mains. Food selection is great topped with an amazing view. Would recommend this place with family as well
5
My first visit to Level 33 wasn’t great - the roast was cold, poor quality, they gave me the entire bill (including drinks) on the house and said “give us another chance”. I’m so glad I did because this is just a fabulous place to eat and that really was just a once off issue. This is an incredible place to bring guests for the “wow” view and enjoy some very delightful craft beer brewed onsite.This particular visit was when my parents were over - vegan choice plus plenty for my carnivore parent (and theirs looked delicious). Not as delicious as mine - the truffle kumara. Yum!Also loved the Paris Lush beer/champagne cocktail - a nice surprise!Will keep on coming back because the food and atmosphere is just wonderful
5
The night view was really amazing, we could see the light show from Marina Bay Sands. Ordered the scallop taste okay, Lamb was amazing and the pork is quite good, the choco as for dessert is good as well. We didn't try the beers since I'm not really a fan of beer but the cocktail and mocktail are good. The staff was really friendly, he was checking on us if everything was okay. The main course waiting time was quite long, took almost an hour to come but we were not in a hurry and also we enjoyed the ambience so not a big drama. Overall, it was an awesome experience for m
1
The view is awesome, especially if you have a good table at the window or outside. We were with 4 last evening and ordered our starters, from which especially the octopus was really nice. Then it started...the main course was served, all of the dishes were cold....most likely the main course was prepared already while we had not finished the starters yet. We had to send back 2 main courses and they would prepare 2 new ones for us. However the other 2 had to finish and eat the side dishes in order not to get cold eather. In the mean time they served some pieces of beef and prawns to make it up. Those tasted really good. 2nd try, the 2 new prepared main courses were finished. Much better, however the prawns that they cook in a small pot for 1 minute was served raw.....Kind of fed up with the service at the moment. So opted not to order any desserts but only coffee. Bill arrived at the table, the extra beef and prawns they served was FOC. Really dissapointed how the Staff/Management acted on the cold main coursed and the raw prawns served. LeVel 33 get your .....act togeher and properly train your staff. Not so ofted dissapointed, this was one of my worst experiences in Singapore so far
5
We have made a stopover here during our walk for a lunch.We were lucky to have the table outside in first line overlooking the Bay.The menu is not big, but the dishes were great!I ordered grilled shrimps and homemade craft beer.If you want to enjoy the view I would recommend to book the table in advanc
4
View was great with night scenery of marina bay. Good for business dinner though too crowded and packed for romantic dates. Food was ok and beer menu interesting with beer cocktails for ladies. Service was good and prompt.
3
LeVel 33 is a nice place for drinks (abit on the higher side, but its understood), but definitely not a good place for nice food. Steak is dry and tough. Any Aston outlet can beat them hands down.
4
Good experience with Level 33 again. Good selection of partial buffet and the fish and chips were very nice. Service is not bad. Thank u.
5
Excellent spread from the Salad bar and the main were terrific! The waitering team are really well trained. Very polite and courteous with prompt service. Value for money of course and a fantastic view as well.
5
We had the chateaubriand which was cooked perfectly! The steak tartare was also outstanding. Although it was pricey the quality of the food was great.
3
This is a great place with nice scenery, place is nicely set up as well.The beer is nice but the main course for the steak is rather disappointing as the presentation is rather plain and simple....although the side dishes need to be ordered separately, I would have prefer it to be served together with the steak as the steak presentation on a large plate with just the steak and some sauce really look pathetic! Other than that, the nice evening was actually very nice up until a bigger group of guest turn up sitting behind me and wife and totally spoilt our evening as they spoke so loudly that my wife actually have no mood to carry on much conversation! The service crew should have advise the guests to lower their volume for the sake of other guests dining experiences....to think that they are all from different countries and yet speak as if they are the only group in the restaurant! Service staff services is wonderful, i would have rate them 5 star if not for the noisy group.Overall rating should be higher but experience was spoilt by that group again...Food wise, perhaps we have ordered the wrong choices....they might not be strong in doing nice steak....my advise is to choose other food on the menu....
5
We took the family to Level 33 for drinks & dinner and it was fabulous. We booked a table outside as we wanted to take in the amazing view and were seated right on the corner with uninterrupted views across Marina Bay and Singapore. It is well worth booking to sit outside (weather permitting) and enjoying Singapore transition from daytime to nighttime. We enjoyed a range of small plates from the bar menu which the kids particularly enjoyed. Some of us then ordered from the main menu for mains while some of the kids did a repeat on their favourite plate from the bar menu. The service & the food was excellent. This is an amazing place to enjoy great food & drinks as well as taking in the amazing view
4
I had dinner here on a recent vacation. This place has a spectacular view of the Sands Marina Hotel and the entire harbor area. The beer was okay but I am coming from a beer centric town and the expectations are very high. The food was good. It is a bit pricey for the decor but I assume they are charging for the high rent and the view
5
The service at Level 33 for New Years was amazing. They had lots of different foods from cheese to Huge Prawns on the appetizer buffet and then the main meal we had a choice of three options. The atmosphere was astonishing! The view of Singapore Harbor and New Year's fireworks from the 33rd story was the place to be
4
The views of the city are pretty amazing. Good idea to get there early so you can get a table outside and then stay til the city lights up. We only had a few beers and sone snacks. It is expensive but worth it for the view
5
I celebrate Christmas lunch with my family. The lunch menu is very nice quality-price worthy. The views to marina bay are amazing. We would repeat!
4
Personally wise, food was pretty disappointing, ordered the duck which wasn’t cooked very well and the sauce didn’t work with it. But otherwise, sensational views, great service and great beer.
4
This is a great vantage point to look over Singapore - a wonderful place to take someone for drinks or a very fancy meal.
The prices are a little high but the location is extremely beautiful
5
We wanted a good place to watch the 8pm light show and took a punt on LeVeL 33. We arrived early - just before 7pm - and were lucky enough to get a standing up bar table outside, right on the edge of the balcony. We enjoyed a few interesting craft beers whilst Singapore transitioned from day to night. A fantastic spot if you can get yourself the right table.
4
Prior to visiting the restaurant, we'd asked if we could book outside seats via email and the reply was that it was possible, but there would have to be a minimum spending of SGD60 per person. My advice would be: don't bother booking and instead, try to come here on a weekday afternoon/evening. We visited the restaurant at about 4:30pm and we were able to get an outside seat in about 5 minutes with no required minimum spending. As we'd expected, the view outside was absolutely splendid. You get a towering view of the entire town area and much more!We ordered 2 beer paddles(comes with 5 100ml glasses of different kinds of beer) and it cost about SGD23+ each. We also ordered some black angus beef sliders, which cost about SGD20+. The total bill amounted to SGD80 for just beer and a small plate of beef cubes. Expensive? Definitely. Worth it? I think it's one of those things where you do once in a while to indulge yourself and I definitely enjoyed myself. However, it's really only worth it if you are able to get an outside seat.Service was good. Everything was served very quickly and the staff were attentive and efficient. One of the staff promised to find me an outside seat in about 5-10 minutes and that, she did. Overall, it was quite the experience and I'd suggest everyone to give this place a try. You'll go home with a lot of nice photos to show off too
5
Recently went for a view of Singapore that my friend told me about. Loved the craft beers and beer cocktails. Great Hendricks gin and tonic as well. Loved the service and had a great time. Will be back. Smoking outside which is good. Great vibe. The place to be. Easy to find. Took some great pics from there as well. LeVel 33 is amazing. Go early for a good seat.
3
This was my third time to LeVeL33, this time with larger group (7). The semi-buffet (called Ploughman's table) was not up to it's usual standard - the one which I had been impressed by. The baked ham was not there, and there was an average selection of salads. The cured meats and seafood (mussels, prawns, salmon) were good though. However - the mains were somewhat disappointing. The pork cheek which I recalled with some fondness from previous visits was a little hard (overcooked?) - and somehow, not as tasty.Service, although friendly and pleasant, was patchy. But I suppose that's a function of inadequate wait staff
4
Perfect location for dinner, drinks & city views & lasershow looking across to the Marina Sands Bay.Visiting Singapore with friends, I was catching up with an old school friend that now lives in Singapore.Loved the wide selection of meals & drinks on the menu.A beautiful location that is sophisticated, great service & views. Not too overcrowded given its fabulous location, and allowed for long catchup sessions on old time
5
We had beers and a meal. Great spot. You need to get to tower 1 and then just walk through standard chartered foyer and take the lift. Fantastic views. Exceptional service. Wonderful food. My partner was not feeling well and didn't ear his beef carpaccio and they took it off the bill. Great veggie options. Highly recommend
4
My other half brought me to this amazing place for my birthday. The view was simply amazing. We ordered steaks for our main courses, which was not bad. The dessert though, was the main highlight. Usually in most restaurants for birthdays they have have the typical birthday cake, but what I got was a platter of mini desserts that they offer. It was simply amazing.If you are into beers, then you may be very interested to visit the place as they brew their own beers and have very unique beer cocktails . The ambience is very relaxing and it is definitely a great place to unwind and chill for drinks after work. Overall, we enjoyed dining at LeVeL 33 for the ambience but the steaks we had wasn’t that grea
3
We went as a group of 10. The fish was superb. However the done-ness of the steak were off and somehow dry for those who ordered medium well. Can be improved.
5
This craft brewery/restaurant has amazing views from the 33rd floor. The food is good the beers excellent and the staff very helpful - highly recommended! The kangaroo steak was superb.
4
Most enjoyed the skyline view of singapore, nice and cosy place for chill out & romantic dinner. Had a great time.
5
My table was served by a young man called Ming. He took time to understand our preferences and made perfect recommendations. Food was delectable. Perfect experience.
5
Enjoyed the antipasti buffet and the burger. Reasonably priced considering the buffet spread and nice view. Good venue for a business lunch although it can be a tad noisy
5
I loved this place, it is a perfect place for drink, they have a nice beer and a perfect place for appreciate the view. It is a beautiful place for drink and for fun.
The food is also really good !!
3
This place came out to be one of the top list restaurant to visit as they have the splendid view of the bay. Food was average, but overall we enjoy the dinner. Staff were friendly but this place is more casual then I was expected. Maybe it is more for a restaurant for those residents near by . If you like beer, can try their beer tasting paddle. If you are looking for a place to have a beer of something, and chit chat... this is a great place to hangout with 3 or 4 pals!
5
Worth a visit for the view alone but the beer list is solid, I only had the IPA which was fine. French fries also pretty good, menu looked worth exploring. I went off-hours and it was still pretty crowded in the bar area, I wouldn't try it during the happy hour or dinner rush. It's a bit hidden, look for the separate elevator tucked in the back of one of the marina towers
5
Arrived at the restuarant and was promptly ushered to our seats. The staff took our orders and also asked if we want to shift to outdoor seats later, which we said yes. We ordered the Ribeye steak and Pork. The food quality was excellent, really enjoyed it. Ordered our desserts and the staff actually remembered our request, and help to shift us to an outdoor seat with excellent Night view. Am super impress with the attentiveness of the staffs. Definitely will recommend to my friend
5
The place is awesome!Greeted by a specialized lift that serves only lvl 33, we were then amazed by the interiors of the venue. Next time i will go for the food. Ive heard theyve got fantastic steak. We went out to the open concept standing area. The view is awesome and the weather was making it better. Drinks before 8pm was pretty cheap and the price is comparable with pubs in clarke quay after 8pm. So far i know of a few places with such good view ~ OneAltitude , Kudeta. Now i have added one more to the list.
4
Ate her for Sunday lunch. Very good two course lunch. Service good. The view over to the MBS is stunning.. It's worth booking an outside table for coffee and drinks after.
4
The atmosphere is really nice, the food was delicious and the view was beautiful. Try a beer cocktail, it was surprisingly really good! Great service and a nice evening. Would recommend for a couple
5
Always love going to Level33. It's casual without being tshirt-ish, smart enough to dress up for, great place to chill with friends or take a colleague too. The food is good and view fantastic!
4
Services and food was good. Restaurant accommodate my request for birthday writing on dessert. Will definitely go again or intro to my friends.
5
Was there for aperitif and dinner. The view was perfect view, excellent food and excellent service. We had pork, lamb and kangaroo meats.
5
Just had my Sons 16th Birthday lunch here, the food in nice the service is excellent, would highly recommend this place, and it is not too expensive, not for the quality of food and type of service.The guy who was serving our table was the best, I turned suffering from hey fever and was sneezing quite a bit, he even asked me if I would like to change my ice water to warm water, it’s just the little things like that, that make the whole experience so much nicer
5
To start of with I didn’t have a reservation at this place and the place was completely packed on a weekday and the staff here was very helpful to get me a table , the craft beers were amazing tried the wheat beer , the stout and the lager loved it , the view from this place was crazyyy a must visit place when you’re in Singapore
3
This was on the list of amazing things to do but I'm unsure why. Its a nice place that has quick staff and a nice variety of drinks but nothing really WOWED me at all and I actually forgot we went there after our trip. It's nice if your in the area but if you have limited stuff to do I would give this a pass as there are much much nicer places you can spend money in.Good views! Not the greatest views ... get in early for a seat. There were no personal vibes or touches during our visit and we left not the most impressed .
4
The service here is terrible. I've been here a few times but never been allowed to order. I came for the view and expected to have to pay for a drink or two while enjoying it. After 45 minutes, nobody had bothered to take my order. So I left.However, the view is simply stunning! I would argue it is the best view in the city, even better than from Mandarin Bay Sands hotel or Altitude. Now, if only the staff would pay attention...It is located on the 33rd floor and hosts a micro brewery. Admission is free
4
The main draw for Level 33 is certainly the beer and the views of Marina Bay. The beer is undoubtedly good. Tried the Chestnut beer (special brew at the time), and the IPA and enjoyed both. For dinner, the ribeye steak was of good quality, but on the thinner side at 200g. On the whole, all in our party enjoyed our dinners, but nothing was fantastically outstanding. Good, but again the highlight here is the beer and views. The atmosphere in the restaurant was standard trendy, and with the copper beer vats. The atmosphere outside in the balcony is fantastic with the angle of Marina Bay capturing the MBS hotel and spanning all the way across to the Fullerton Hotel. Definitely Instagram worthy. If you can book a table outside, and prefer the alfresco dining, then that is recommended. If you have out-of-town guests who like beer and would like a great vantage point of Singapore, then this is the place.
5
visit to the Bay is a must but visit Bar 33 a sunset the view is awesome and the lights are fantastic
5
Been here many times never ceases to impress - had the Gnocchi which was wonderful. Beer is excellent - try the taster set
4
Food was great.
Ambience was great.
Service was great. Pre-ordered a Cocoa as a birthday cake/dessert and the waitress did not ruin the surprise and served it after dinner.
Price was a little expensive.
Overall was worth the experience, but only good for special occasions.
4
Has to be one of the worlds higest microbrewery.
The beers were great. The $10 bowl of chips well overpriced. But a must see when visiting Singapore if you like beer.
An awesome place to see the typical afternoon storm too
3
Food are okay, atmosphere was good, staff service was great, view from the level is amazing and wonderful.
5
Dropped in for drinks and dinner and were greeted by very nice and helpful staff making it happen. Wonderful outside seating with a fantastic view combined with simple, but very delicious food. And the beer from one of the highest breweries ... excellent combination! One of our favorites in SG.
4
Really good food with excellent service in clean/modern surroundings with a lovely view of the city. Also they have excellent beer... I recommend the IPA. But.. it will cost you a pretty penny and the portions can be a tad small, so if its value you want you might want to try something closer to ground level
4
Food and drinks here are good (not outstanding though). Service was really friendly. Our food came out cold and they comp'ed the dish for us. I do think this place is overpriced though, and you really only get to appreciate the view if you are sitting outside
4
Tried the craft beer first, was very good, better than I expected. Food was good, scallop starter, steak main. Nice ambience and wonderful views from the terrace. Doesn’t quite make it to 5 stars: I thought the wine menu a little strange (and the wines are expensive even by Singapore standards); and we had a trainee waitress, so the service could have been better. But I’d still go back. Overall, a nice evening and a pleasant experience
3
Great view of the marina and no doubt of the light shows that happens there daily.If you want to watch the lights, book a table outside (as space goes quickly) and check the times locally. Beer is good but definitely not cheap, nor could it be classed as reasonably priced. $30 Singapore for two small beers.It is all about the vie
5
Sensational View, wonderful staff, food out of this world and an excellent wine selection. A little on the expensive side but I would not hesitate to recommend LeVeL33 to anybody.
4
We came for the Sunday Roast - the food was really nice, but its really important that it comes out at the right temperature. It was pretty cold by the time it got to our table. Really great taste though.
5
one of top 10 things to do in Singapore especially at night. The views are fantastic & so is the home brewed beer.
5
Don't mess around! Go straight away to Level 33! Best service, view and nice food! Anytime!!!! Then u can go anywhere!
4
Recommend this place for an evening drink on the balcony to soak up the light show of Marina Bay Sands. Excellent wine and drink menu. Quick service. Don't worry if you don't get a outer table first up - you will as they turnover fast as people move on to dinner
3
After being urged to visit this restaurant by a friend, we decided to take the plunge (so to speak). Wednesday evening, still very busy and decided to check out the bar only. When you get to the building the lift is pretty dingy, subdued lighting and a stuffy elevator. We you reach the eatery you are greeted immediately for either a table or a seat outside on the balcony. To be honest, I'm glad we did not book to eat, it was pretty busy, not very intimate, quite harsh lighting and LOTS of people. Mostly with phones and cameras to take pics. The view is stunning, there is no getting away from that. The drinks service was very quick and efficient. So I can't comment on the food, but for experiencing a great view, well worth a visit and at night is a must
5
Level 33 has the best view of any restaurant in Singapore. It overlooks the Marina Bay area. The restaurant has an outside area which is great for a drink, snack or desert. The inside restaurant area has a very nice atmosphere. The food was delicious. The staff was very friendly. Although it is actually a mini brewery, the wines they serve are beautiful. If you have anything special to celebrate, or want to have good food with a nice drink and an amazing view, Level 33 is a great place to go..
5
Booked several weeks in advance, after locating the place ( not that easy!) we were disappointed to be offered perhaps the worst table of all.... far fro windows or balcony, near toilets... after a plea to staff we were moved to one of the best, on balcony overlooking the bay, perfect. Food (a la carte) and beer was fantastic, service impeccable. Make sure you ask for an outside table and you’ll love it. Pricier than we’d usually choose but that’s unsurprising given the locatio
5
The view of Singapore Marina Bay never ceases to amaze me. The bay area towards the Singapore river was one of first areas where the Chinese settlers set up their businesses in the 19th century. Now the bay area is one of the global financial districts with skyscrapers, casinos, entertainment centers.LeVel33 is located in one of the skyscapers in this relatively new bay area. We were celebrating our daughter's 21st birthday. Service, location and food were all excellent. Highly recommended for evening cocktails or dinner
5
I came here on my first visit to Singapore. Beautiful view overlooking Marina Bay. We dined in the evening and had a window seat indoors. Perfect spot of the restaurant. The menu is extensive for both food and wine and they do cater a couple of dishes to vegetarian. I cannot fault the food that was presented in front of us, it was fresh and cooked to perfection and the dessert was delicious! We indulged in an Australian wine which was superb. Level 33 is a great location for fine dining. Yes it is on the expensive side, but for a first visit and birthday celebration, I did not mind paying for it :
4
5 kinds of beer are available. Of course, they have different taste fitting for each dish.
In addition, we could enjoyed nice view of the bay.
There were some people accompanying children. It was quite strange from my common sense.
5
Always my go to restaurant for business lunch. At the heart of mbfc, convenient and good service with high quality food. I will go there at least twice a month. Thumb up for level 33.
4
We came for the food and the views and were not disappointed. A reasonable menu with a generous buffet. Some excellent cheeses.
4
Came to this place after business training at MBFC. The view is great, unfortunately when we come to this place, the weather is bad. So we can sit outside. Their seasonal chesnut beer is good. The food is great. Excellent service too.
5
Love the view, food, drinks and ambiance. All in all a great experience, especially the paddle, love that i can try a bit of everything.
1
Take the lift and enjoy the unique view of Singapore and Marina Bay Sands!...Maybe this place is just a nice bar with great terrasse!Food was just awful, our lamb have been cooked with microwave...restaurant recognized it and did not charge us for this meal...Dessert was supposed to reconcile us but was neither better ...!Go for a beer... but have dinner first somewhere else

LeVeL 33 Located in the Marina Bay Financial Centre Tower 1, LeVeL 33 has a dedicated elevator, which takes you straight from the lobby to the restaurant. The restaurant offers both inside and outside seating, and provides great views across Singapore, looking towards the Marina Bay Sands hotel and casino.I only had drinks and appetisers at LeVeL 33 but both were very good. The staff were efficient and friendly throughout the evening. Definitely worth a visit if you're in the area

Its my few times already to sit in the terrace with the view facing Singapore city side and MBS, while the wind blows calmly, they serve you a craft beers after you ordered. This time we came with my wife and kids with friend. Kids loves the beef sizzling & even continued to get prime rib soon after. Cesar salad was OK, as we shared and each of us enjoyed the steak. Service is nice, between courses, attention to the needs, picture assistance and little conversation was appreciated, without being too much. It is one of the best spot to unwind and get the day go away ..
5
My partner and I decided on Level 33 after reading the reviews. We wanted somewhere to treat ourselves to good views, good wine and good views. We aren’t disappointed. Having arrived just before sunset, the views were amazing. Sadly, the outside tables were all taken and reserved for the rest of the evening. But we were not disappointed with the inside. The steak was delicious, the staff were friendly, informative and attentive. Who wouldn’t like it here.

We had a wonderful evening at Level 33. The service was excellent and attentive. The view is stunning, even when it is raining. We arrived having booked a table on the balcony but it was pouring with rain. The restaurant was fully booked but the hostess went out of her way to find us a table. We had a lovely and short wait at the bar where we enjoyed their craft beers. Highly recommend the Pale Ale or the Porter.Dinner menu has a few but perfect options. The food looked and tasted great. I can recommend the cheese platter and the gnocchi.The wine selection was not to bad but on the pricey side (as with many finer dining restaurants).All in All a wonderful evening, great food, great beer and a great view when the rain cleared
5
Perfect view towards Marina Bay, great indoor and outdoor seating, great beers to taste accompanied by delicious food.
4
Service is good but make sure you make reservation early as the restaurant might be full. Beers have different flavors which their own specially brew.
5
Nice ambiance, we had both indoor and out door experience. Was lucky that the night had some breeze and nice views. Service staffs are friendly and well train in recommending their food and drinks.
5
A handy place for great value business lunch - you help yourself to the appetizer/salad and dessert and simply order the main. The fish and chips were marvelous and you can choose among seasonal main dishes. The view is spectacular
4
Set menu lunch - very nicely presented buffet as an entree with lots of choice - followed by limited set of mains to select. Steak looked good, fish looked good but pleased I selected gnocchi which was very tasty. Not large portions so if you are really hungry, load up on the buffet. One soft drink each, one coffee each plus tax etc and advertised $42/head became $70. Spectacular views over Marina Bay.It is also a great place for an evening beer on the outdoor terrace - own micro brewery and good atmosphere though not a cheap exercise
5
This place has the best view over the skyline and marina bay sands with the laser show etc! Make reservations in advance! The dinner is delicious and the make some special beers en advice wich beer suits your meal! After your dinner they have a lovely seat outside with the best view!! Best place in Singapore to me!!
5
I personally like Level 33 for the great view, and would immediately request to be on the waiting list for the outdoor table. I bring every foreign friend visiting Singapore to Level 33 too. All of them loved the view and came back the second time.My boyfriend loves the IPA there, that's what he talks about more than the view lol.I wouldn't eat there though, it's too expensiv

Managed to stumble across this place as we were walking our way through the Marina Bay district seeing the sites. We decided we would stop in for a cold one as this is one of a number of places in Singapore that are part of a growing craft beer trend in the city. We arrived, and without even having to ask we were seated outside on the terrace overlooking Marina Bay and the beautiful Singapore cityscape. There were six in-house brews to choose from, and we settled on the blonde lager, which was very good (and FYI happy hour is from 3-8 pm every week day). Also ordered the chicken sliders and sizzling prawns off of the appetizer menu, both of which were also very good. The service was exceptionally attentive and friendly. Overall the experience was worth the slightly inflated prices paid (14$ 500 ml beers - the happy hour price), but up here you're clearly paying for the ambience and the view. And after having experienced it for what turned out to be over 3 hrs, I would conclude that it was well worth it. As the city darkened the already spectacular view became unforgettable. I highly recommend you visit once during your stay in Singapore
4
Amazing view and fantastic beer. So worth a visit at any time. We only had some French fries as a snack and they were very nice. Sunday roast menu looked good but clearly on the more expensive site ... but what to except with this stunning view. A must visit when coming to Singapore
3
We are regular visitors to the bar/restaurant. There are some changes or business restructure, therefore the food was just horrible: from our experience the pork not fresh, grilled beef raw and cold , duck cold, the potatoes just reheated in microwave. I couldn't believe what is happening and what is the reason of badly cooked mains. Don't recognise for dinner, only beer.
5
The view is exceptional, go there around before sunset to see the change of lights, it's magical! The beer is also very good and the finger food not too bad either :)
4
Went there for their craft beer and it was great, nice environment, attentive and prepared staff. The food was ok, but sirloin steak was really disappointed for that price. Octopus and prawns was really good and dessert portion good to share
5
Great views, easy to find and great food/service. Children also welcome, but don't cater so well for them. However the staff and chefs did their bests to adapt the menu to suit.
2
Staff have a ‘I’m better than you’ attitude
Overall pushy and aggressive staff with a touch of racism
One server coughed on my drinks
Not good for business meeting because the staff are always in your face
Great view, good selection of drinks but expensive
5
Outstanding food, phenomenal setting and excellent service. Great place for dinner or drinks!! Will visit again and again.
3
What a view! This restaurant/brewery is located on the 33rd floor and has a great view towards the marina bay. Try to get a table outside if you can. The beer is good as is the food. We had some finger food and the octopus was excellent! Nice place to for a chat, after work drinks etc.
2
We were here while it was hardly raining and were completely disappointed. The view over the city is really amazing, but it was raining and they closed the Terrasse. So the atmosphere inside was very bad, not nice at all. Besides that, It is a brewery, and you can smell in every corner the beer. We were there in a Thursday and it was very full of people, I'd say business people after work. We didn't get even a place at the bar. As we saw a lot of tables empty, we asked for a place but they told us the tables should be prepared for the next day, so we can not offer any one to you, very funny argument:-)So if it is a rainy day, avoid it, otherwise you will be more than disappointed. If it is a nice day, go there for the stunning view, but better earlier in the evening.
5
This bar was recommended to me by the hotel I was staying at as somewhere with a great view, reasonably priced for Singapore and fine for a lone traveller. It definitely ticked all of those boxes. Level 33 craft their own beer, so there’s a nice selection for you to choose from, and they even do flights if you want to sample a bit of each one. As I’m not one for the darker ales, I thought I’d dive straight in and have a pint of their wheat beer, closely followed by a pint of their IPA. Both were very nice! Being by myself it didn’t take too long before I got a table outside. In fact the guy who served me and got me my table was really friendly and helpful. From my observations it did seem like there was a good team of staff working there. To take in the lovely view from the rooftop I also indulged myself with some John Dory Tempura and some Chicken Sliders. Again, both were lovely! I would 100% go back to this place. It’s not pretentious, it’s not loud, it’s not THAT expensive for Singapore considering you usually pay a supplement at roof top bars just for the view. A pint is $17.33, which might sound a lot, but considering I paid $18 at Oxwell & Co for no view and not even a pint, it’s not too bad. My bill with the two food items as well came to $73.15 including service (about £40
4
A great place for a beer at sunset. Watch the marina change from light to sunset in 10mins, stay a little longer and enjoy the marina fountains show. Beer selection is good and all locally brewed. Food is also great with nice snacks to eat while you drink and take in the sights. Definitely worth a visit.
5
Actually we had wait for the food for an hour. After we'd done the meal, Ming, the service crew attended us with apologies and automatically offered us to continue our drinks at balcony for the night view. Also he served desserts as complimentary.For the food average is good. The choc dessert is awesome. The fresh brew beers of course is a must try
2
Multiple requests (4 times) to have a seat beside the patio was ignored with 'I will check for you'.
4
The food was good, ambience is great and the view was simply awesome. If you looking for combination of the above to hang out with your friend, try Level 33. 😀
5
The view was great, food was nice and staff are friendly. Upon knowing that it was a meal to celebrate my father's birthday, the staff prepared a cake to surprise him!
5
Best view of Marina Bay Sands and the harbor area. Great apps and brews to chill with friends or business colleagues.
4
Level 33 is the place to go for a fab view and great beer. The dinner menu is good but is quite limited. The gnocchi with lamb ragu was amazing. Great place to take visitors. No complaints and the service was impeccable.
4
Level 33 is indeed one of the best place to feel for best draft beer. Especially, it is affordable to have a affordable Weekend brunch menu.
5
We came here a couple of times during a recent visit for the F1 GP, amazing to have a craft brewery up on the 33rd floor of a building in the financial district.Loved seeing all the brewery equipment as you walk in and through to the main dining / drinking areas. Great views of Marina bay during the day, amazing at night time!.We tried the Festbier, a couple of times... it was very good although some of the prices for snacks were a bit pricey, but then, views were spectacular. Make sure you book well ahead to secure a prime spot outside for the views
5
A group of us met here for lunch and it was fabulous - a buffet starter with a choice of main course for a set price....the food was fresh, tasty and there was loads of variety to suit all tastes. Great views overlooking Marina Bay Sands hotel - apparently it's also a great place to watch the light show from in the evenings. A definite recommendation from me!
5
Level 33 is a nice place to unwind with fantastic views and a relaxed environment. I was there with a friend and had the jumbo prawns which was fresh and well seared. My friend ordered a medium rare steak which unfortunately came as medium. When this was alerted to the manager on duty, Anthony, he gamely changed it. However to our surprise, he returned with a plate of prawns and suggested to take the steak off our bill. This was totally not anticipated and certainly rare service from Singapore restaurants. Kudos to him for a fast service recovery which will definitely mean that we will return with friends. Great Job Anthony and Level 33 for empowering your staff.
5
If you crave the occasional, traditional and downright delicious Sunday Roast then Level 33 is the place to go in Singapore. It's a fantastic setting overlooking MBS that is complimented by great service. You will leave with that lazy Sunday afternoon 'I just want to lay on the sofa and snooze' feeling. My wife and I both had the Roast Beef with Yorkshire pudding and plenty of rich gravy. A lovely reminder of home albeit somewhat warmer! Well worth a visit. We will be back on a regular basis.
5
Overview in the whole of Marina Bay. Good choice to be in late afternoon transiting to dark skies so that you can enjoy the contrast of beauty
2
Great appetiser, however the mains were horrible
only the battered fish and pork was good
every other dish was horrible, steak was over and quality of meat was poor
4
Visited early evening for drinks and snacks. Took the sample paddle of home brewed beers, great fun. Stood outside overlooking the bay and enjoyed the laser light show. great place to drink in the tourist side of Singapore.
5
Great as always. Ensure u sit outside on the balcony to get the views. Much better than marina bay sands.
4
My partner and I visited Level 33 this year (2017) as part of our honeymoon trip through Singapore. Last year during the F1 we visited the bar and wanted the same experience again.We pre-booked a table on the balcony again which comes with a minimum spend per person (which was cheaper than what is set during the F1 weekend). The view is extraordinary and such a great experience to see the sun go down and the lights come on, also with it outside it's a proper feel of how high you are.We ordered drinks which was very quick to arrive and I had to have a paddle of beers again which offers all different types of ale that they produce. Although we made it clear to the waiter we were wanting to also order food it did take a good bit of time to actually be served for our meals.Apologies were made and the food arrived a short while after which was really good. We ordered a selection of appetizers rather than main meals and shared as it allowed us to sample all the different food. The beef sizzler was amazing as were the spicy chicken wings.Overall this is a great place to visit with anyone although we were aware it is mainly office workers who were frequenting the place. The bar is easy to find and the food is excellent, there is also a good selection of drinks too, the staff service wasn't the best even though there seemed to be many people working there
1
Had planned for a nice eve but...- restrooms smells like worst European subway restrooms. Honestly for a high quality restaurant...- Drinks never came - Order medium on the beef got blue This place was a kindergarten with clowns working...sorry expected significantly moreGood luck..
5
Fantastic food, delicious beer and exemplary service as ever. Fancy food that won't leave you hungry, great value for money. Their in house brewed beers are the perfect complement to the food. Relax with a post dinner coffee on the balcony looking out over views of the bay
3
The appetizer was excellent, but main was worse. The difference of the quality between appetizers and main dish was very large and I really surprised. You need to improve the quality of the main dish. Also, I wanted to have a tea or coffee after lunch, however the course didn't include tea or coffee so that was sad. So I prefer that the course should include tea or coffee.
5
Best service, food and view of any restaurant I've been to around the world. Beef tartare and American duck are a must try. Beers are good and the wine list is excellent, with a nice variety of regions from around the world. Try and book in advance for a window seat and stay for a drink on the balcony afterwards or beforehand.
5
The hospitality, quality beer and view are all first class, nothing better than an IPA and a smoke on a high rise balcony with a view of Marina Bay. Chris the Manager could not have been a nicer person, what a man, great guy who has so much passion for his craft and treats his staff like his family. Love this place, you must go
5
If you are looking for place to unwind with good food and drinks look no further. Make sure to get place on balcony on the right (more wind and better views).
3
Good atmosphere so lively in the early evening. Good mix of menu but nothing cheap stick to street markets for that
5
This is a fantastic place. We just had the beers but the food also looked excellent. Must do. Views across the bay from 33 floors up.
3
This is a rooftop restaurant. Reservation is a must I guess. The food was great but a bit pricey. You can stay outside after dinner to see the great view
5
Always excellent food, excellent service. The staff always Ensure you have a lovely evening and feel special in this fabulous location and special setting restaurant. Simply fabulous as usual.
4
Lovely beer (although VERY pricey), but worth it for a lovely view over the city at night. It closes quite early, so be sure to get there in plenty of time.
5
Great view with a great experience of drinking here. (Minus the one waiter who had an OCD about using coasters for drinks)
5
The Sunday roast was outstanding, great combination of flavours and a great variety.
The service staff were attentive to our needs and happy to be there.
5
Great view of the F1 race at the outdoor tables. Great food! Wonderful beer! The staff were really great. Friendly and helpful, especially Azri. He was very helpful in recommending the food and drinks and even explained the different kinds of food on the platter. And when it started drizzle, he came out with umbrellas! Great job guys! It was our third visit there already! Will definitely come again
5
The food was delicious. We started out with the scallops which were to die for! Then we had the lamb and surf n turf. It was all so flavorful and well prepared. The view is amazing if you can reserve a place outside. A must eat
5
The view from level 33 is always one that captivates especially if you arrive early evening before sunset. Food is great with a wide selection of beers. All reasonably priced given the location!
5
Best view in Singapore! And great craft beer! They brew their own stuff... and have an amazing terrace. Make sure to book a table
5
Awesome stout, good snacks. Kitchen is closing at 9pm but bat at midnight- it's weird.
Amazing view to Marina Bay.
5
Perfect terrace view with good beer. At the evening the terrace can get crowded so make sure you get there early. Tripod is not allowed. Their beers are awesome too but not the giant fries.
4
I think the ambience is great. The service is moderate but meet expectations. Food wise is tasty but the price a bit steep.
4
Very lovely place,magic cocktails,well crafted beer but if there very hot outside,you can't relax at the balcony,no air to breathe,too hot!(((Also strange thing with credit card:when you come and make order they take it and give back when you finished!)))Like REALLY?!?!In such "luxury" place?))However,food is good,drinks to
5
Nice rooftop with a good view of the Marina Bay Sands and the CBD. Don't forget to make a reservation if you want to go around 6pm, a lot of people working in the tower and around come for the after work. Plenty of choice in beers. The soft are not expensive compared to other rooftops.
5
Great view of Marina Bay and Singapore CBD. Food good and reasonably priced considering location and style of restaurant. Beer Heaven with good range and again reasonably priced for Singapore beer prices. Service is great. Very friendly and helpful staff. Recommend this place highly. Will definitely be bac
1
Haven't been back in ages but had a great experience last time so decided to come back for dinner. Not easy to get a reservation so I assumed food must still be awesome. What a shocker. Had salad as an appetizer which was 2/5 at best. Steak came next and they got my order wrong. Got medium rare when I ordered medium and my wife got medium rare when she ordered medium well. Asst manager offered us a free dessert as an apology but that was disappointing as well. Plus I found a strand of hair in the fruits. Gave us a glass of champagne to make up for it but I don't drink champagne. Overall very disappointed. Maybe they are too focused on the beers. Improve the food experience please.
5
Well, as close as you can get as it's on the 33rd floor with spectacular views across Marina Bay!Beer brewed on the the premises. World's highest craft brewery. The IPA is particularly good. As is the buffet. The set lunch is a bit much (too much food and too much money), but a great place with great service. Highly recommended
4
food was normal. Nice place to bring guests who visit Singapore for temporary visit and have beer...
5
Officially the most beautiful view of Singapore! The food is very good and so is the service and the friendly staff :)
Plus, it's the highest brewery of the world for the beer lovers.
5
Yes, LeVel 33 is amazing. Book a table outside for an unforgettable view. Try a flight of their home-made brews. Enjoy excellent food. We loved the decor--modern, imaginative, welcoming. Highly recommended!
4
Visited here with my wife whilst on holidays. Was recommended by a friend and glad we made the effort to visit. Drinks aren't cheap but then again you would pay the price of drinks for a view from an observation deck.
1
A special dinner celebration was spoilt by bad treatment by an arrogant manager at the outdoor area.
5
We had group lunch and was awed by the beautiful marina bay skyline , it was just breathtaking. The semi buffet set lunch was good , it offered buffet selection of appetizers and desserts with an ala carte selection of main course . I also tried their lemon shandy ,which was light and refreshing. Overall, it was a nice setting for a casual lunch with great view and I will definitely return for dinner to enjoy the skyline under the stars !
2
Great expectations.. sadly not experienced... steaks were good but mine was almost cold and served on a smear of mustard ... yuk ... not mentioned on the menu ... not enough staff so lots of waiting and waiting ... Shame really as the view is spectacular ..
5
Overtime we have friends from overseas coming here in Singapore, we will bring them here to appreciate how it is beautiful from the top overlooking the CBD district at night and the MBS. It might get crowded especially at night, so make sure that you make reservations beforehand.Food and beers are good and at reasonable price
5
We went to watch the famous National Day fireworks, having booked months in advance, prepaid cover charge, dressed up, and even dyed my hair red in anticipation of a national day experience not to be forgotten. We specifically booked an outdoor table for the fantastic view. We love this view, and we take every one of our visitors to dine at level 33 for their last night in Singapore, and they love it too. So imagine our disappointment on arrival to find we were seated at an indoor table (near the window, but looking out on the people on the balcony enjoying the fabulous view...). So we complained, asking to sit outside, per our booking, but to no avail. So we sat at our table, watching the folk outside, admiring the view on their phone screens, not in real life. Bit sad. But then the assistant manager, Choy Ming Fung , came over to apologise for the mix up. On one of the busiest nights of the year, he came and checked on us, our food (the Singapore starter platter was huge, delicious, and enough for us as a main!). He then appeared again to take charge of dessert (delicious sample platter, and I love the desserts there. The lavender ice cream was amazing!). We were delighted to find then, on asking for the final bill, it had been taken care of, to make up for our sadness of watching the fireworks from indoors. So, despite a very disappointing table, for our last ever National day in Singapore, the overall experience of level 33 was, as it always has been, excellent. Thank you for making the best of a mix up for us. We will go back, and sit outside again. The view is, imho, one of the best in Singapore, if not Asia!! The food and drinks are also delicious!!
5
Pros:- FOOD: The chefs and the creators behind each dish genuinely put their heart and effort in creating each dish. Skip the "National Day" menu (you can try genuine local fare at the hawker centres for 1-tenth the price!) and do try:1) The Kangaroo meat (S$39++) - Medium Rare to try the meat when grilled, yet savour the flavour when rare. Quality meat exudes its flavour without much seasoning. This is the way meat suppose to be.2) Dessert Assiette (S$38++) - A MUST TRY. Don't let the price turn you off. This dessert is meant for 2, and the dessert chefs take the most effort to create what I call perfection. I call this the "marriage dessert" since the various desserts on the slate platter encompasses elements of sweet (ie. Lavender mousse encased in honey drizzled pastry), sour (ie. ALOT of berries sprinkled with citrus oiled powder), bitter (violet beer ice cream), and spicy (ie. Pink-peppered Chocolate Fondant).3) Craft Beer sampling. Their famous for it. Ambience:Have your dinner inside, but your drinks and dessert outside. Call to request in advance for your specific seat allocations. It is WORTH IT. Service:Request for Azri. He is the most affable service staff. And if you have a bad day, he will cheer you up. 7 years in LeVel33, I would highly recommend him anytime. ;
3
The view from the balcony is definitely the best in Singapore!! The national day platter tasted awesome as well - but the mains (Poulet and Ribeye Steak) were average to decent at best.
4
We were amazed by the stunning view, house brewed beer was a plus point. Chill with friends with breeze on the top. Feel awesome 🆒
5
Awesome marina view.
Delicious dish, good beer and kind staff.
i took terrace table on 8 pm. it is the most impressive view ever i seen.
4
Awesome beer, awesome view. Perfect place for couples, gathering with friends. The service is pretty good as well.
5
Just look at the picture! I mean, breath taking views of the city, while enjoying a good craft beer and a sunset, all you need! Plus, food is good tho
4
The setting of this microbrewery is great. It's on floor 33 of one of the business towers and overlooks the Marina Bay Sands hotel. We sat outside on the terrace and enjoyed a few of the different beers. A good choice for drinks.
5
Amazing views of the marina, so beautiful at night. The food was outstanding as well as the locally brewed beer. The service was excellent, or waiter was attentive, very helpful and professional. A fabulous evening. Recommended for couples, family or business,. Any reason to be there is a good one.
3
Great views over Marina Bay (but you will almost certainly need to book a table to get one outside and it'll come with a minimum spend requirement). The self brewed beer is good too, but then at $20 a pint (500ml) it should be. Place a little spoilt by officious staff who seem to think they are doing you a favour to let you in. Restaurant food is good
5
Level 33 has never disappointed ! Lovely salad buffet spread.. with quality ingredients . There's some seafood and cheese and cold cuts . The rolls were fresh and you had butter ready on the table . The crab and duck rillettes was also yummy! There was a fruit and a chocolate cake for dessert. That was plenty for us.I had the lamb gnocchi for the main dish. And it was really good . Others in my party had steak , burger and the dory fish. Friends tried all the beer on the menu.. and they were happy.A good place for lunch and great place for drinks at night . The view is spectacular .Service is good . I would not hesitate to recommend this place..I will Come back and try the Sunday roast
4
Level 33 is a very interesting place ; who would expect to find a microbrewery on top of a building ?!! The beers are nice and the setting impressive ; you can enjoy a dramatic view above Singapore and Marina Bay Sands. We tried some tapas and it was delicious ! I highly recommend this plac
5
We frequently visit here as the executive lunch is amazing. although it's a little pricey, quality of food is very much worth it.
5
Always a welcoming warm greeting from the service staff. Gorgeous restaurant in a special setting with a view one can never get bored with. Fabulous food and fabulous restaurant. I hear the beer is fab too!
5
Enjoyed my experience at level 33! Love that the executive lunch menu which came w a half buffet as well. Remember to reserve in advance!
4
good food, nice place to hangout with friends, nice view from high level, with MBS view.
price affordable for drinks.
5
We had the lunch special which was buffet starter, hot main course from a choice of three, and buffet dessert. The buffet alone would feed you, so all together it was very good. With a great view and location.
3
Food is above average but not very good. Tried the Cod and market catch, they are fresh and sweet. However the side (prawn) is actually better than their main.Service is good, staff are polite always have a smile on their face. However there are room of improvement, to top-up the drink for the dinner and aware that for tea not to pour right after it is make, as it require sometime to soak in.Atmosphere is average. rather noisy and tables are really packed closed to each other. dont really have privacy with your dinner. If you dont mind those and dine in during festive season (NDP, New year countdown) the fireworks is great
5
We've had a casual business snack & drinks on the terrace of the Level 33. Great food, tried almost everything of the bar food menu, I personally recommend the Singapore style fish'n'chips. Good beer, excellent service. But almost unbeatable is the view onto the Marina Bay - absolutely stunning
5
People go to scenic bars like Level 33 for the views, and don't expect that service will be the best. All I can say is that we have enjoyed outstanding service in our 2 recent visits to this establishment. We were given "Reserved" seating with the gentle reminder that we would have to free up the space in 1 hour which was fine by us. More than that, the quality of the service was excellent---- very pleasant, and extremely efficient. The views are of-course to die for, but it's the service that is the USP; all were very good but Azri was outstanding
3
Doesn't a brewpub on the 33rd floor of a towerblock sound a great idea? Yes. And there is a great view to be enjoyed. But the beer ... I tried the IPA, which bigged up hops in its description but lacked them on the palate. And the wheat beer was a bit like drinking water (and where's the fun in that?). No bite to either beer. Might I suggest that the head brewer hot foots it to the UK and spends some time with Brewdog, Camden Brewery or Howling Hops? Mind you, still a very popular venue, so head brewer might say, 'Why bother?' Because you should make it the best you can, that's why. And at $13.33 (?) a pint, it's not cheap bearing in mind that the transportation and marketing costs are minimal
3
We were here for a drink and enjoying the colourful view from 33 floor. Seat outside the verandah, enjoying the breeze and a cold pin of beer. This is a microbrewery and they have a nice selections of home-brewed beers. Beers and food are decent but the view is the main attractions
4
Booked a table for birthday celebration on Singapore NDP Preview Day 1. The food was not bad, especially the asparagus was good! London fruitty is recommended too. Overall it was good experience to watch firework right in front of you while enjoying your dinner.
4
took a visitor from out of town to sample the beer and take in the spectacular view of marina bay. He thoroughly enjoyed the beer, food and view
5
Watching the sun set and the lights of singapore come on is an amazing experience. The food and beer are amazing. The staff are also very handy at photography
5
Fantastic beer ; food great ; service even when full is second to none. Could do with more AC outside. The views of Marina Bay Sands are exceptional. Apparently to get the colossal brewing vessels into the bar they winched them up the outside.Lovely service and reasonable price by Singapore standards
3
Went for the view and the beer. Meal was expensive but nice. Portion sizes are what you expect at a high end restaurant. Beer was average and for some reason they increase the prices after 8pm. If you have a beer at 730 pm it will cost you $4 more if you have the same beer at 801pm. One big gripe was that upon seating we were asked if we would like water and given an option of flat or sparkling, we chose flat had 1 glass each. Later on paying the bill we noticed we were charged $8.50 for the water, room temperature water. Apparently we had bought the fancy bottle left on the table, we assumed it was a bottle that was refilled and the water was from the tap. Yet when we moved onto the balcony we were provided with free ice water... go figure. At over $300 for a beer tasting board (5 100ml glasses which differed from the list on the menu thus ended up ordering the wrong beer to have with main - waitress did offer to replace with correct one but why waste a beer once poured) 2 x 500ml beers, 1 x $28 cocktail, 2 entrees (one was 2 tiny scallops and the other octopus). 2 x mains (only 1 pork cutlet for a $35 main and sides are extra) the second main had 2 giant prawns and was very nice. 1 double espresso. So to find out we had been charged $8.50 for water that was offered upon seating was just rude and the waitress couldn't have cared less. We tried to explain had we been told there was a charge for the water we would have gotten an ice water from the bar and it would have been nice to be told the cost before it was provided.

We order the tenderloin and the Beef & surf for 2 of us. It was really interesting that they cooked the lobster tail in a hot little cast iron pot with rock salt for 1 min before serving. It was really fresh, but a bit salty due to it being cooked on rock salt. For the tenderloin, it was perfect to our requirement for Medium well. But for the beef for the Beef & surf, the cut was thick, so it was a bit undercooked. Overall, we enjoyed the view & the ambience, but if you are coming for food, I think there are better choices.

We visited for sunset drinks and were very impressed. The beer paddle is the perfect way to sample the craft beer on offer before choosing your favourites. Food was tasty and if it wasn't for our dinner reservations we would've stayed longer. The staff were very helpful with great service. They even notified us of a table outside so we could move from perching to sitting. With amazing views of MBS and further it is a beautiful spot. Definitely go to catch sunset. The lights are amazing

The food was fantastic although the Suckling pork was too dry and the skin wasnt finished correctly - very dissapointed with the pork. The Lamb was fantastic (same as last time) and the meat platter for starters wonderful. Broccolini might as well be called Broccoli - hard not cooked and didnt taste nice, I guess I have been spoiled too long in AU. Wine was good ($$) and it was nice to sit outside after dinner and admire the view. Probably the most expensive meal I have had in SG and it could have been better. Overall a great night (perhaps our guests helped) but a little disappointed in the quality of the main meal (well one main not-cheap plate!)
2
We ordered a ribeye steak with a side of potatoes as well as the starter Pig and Snails. The quality of the beef was terrible- i could get a better steak from Astons at 1/3 the price. The starter was dry and tasteless. However, the beer was good. View was good as well, but unfortunately, we were seated inside. The service was mediocre, took a while before we could catch the attention of the staff. Overall, will not recommend and would probably not return
5
Quite often when you travel to somewhere for a spectacular view, the food and service is compromised, however, not Level33. It has excellent food, service and view! A must-visit whenever we have guest in town, and everyone is impressed. The appetizer and side dishes are generous, so it's good to share those. The main dishes such as Surf & Turf and Gnocci is highly recommended!
4
We enjoy an afternoon drink on Sunday after going to the Art museum. The view there is absolutely good. Staff are helpful. It is a place to recommend for a relaxing time.
4
a nightview was awesome, and the taste of beer was also good. Level33 gave us good services, even though there was a little problem in our reservation. All members in the restaurant were very kind.
5
Went for a dinner with a group of business colleagues and was impressed with the level of service, the amazing views and the quality and variety of the food.
4
The view on Marina Bay is unique! I can recommend going there around 5.30pm - the light during sun set is the most beautiful.
The beers are nice - not all that extraordinary but tasty nonetheless. The food is rather pricey.
5
Amazing bar and restaurant above standard chartered in the marina financial centre. Amazing view of Singapore harbour and coastline, perfect cocktails and food. A must see for a drink and dinner in Singapore.
3
The place is actually, ok. The food is ok, but the service is terrible. I have to speak to the manager, he is apologetic but the damage has been done. I will not recommend and will not come back.
4
nice experience and the drink I recommand is their own beer...
very good one.
Nice view from there specially at night.
they serve for whoever wants to eat but we didn't
4
I came 2x within a month, once for lunch and the second for drinks in the evening. Firstly, the lunch was decent. You get a spread of buffet starters from cold meats to salads and bread rolls....enough to fill up without the main course!!!! Nevertheless, the main course was quite big too. Food was good but the view was better...you practically see every corner of Singapore from here!!!I came for drinks in the evening and the view was even better....if you don't mind the humidity...get a seat outside....the night view is worth the visit. This place serves craft beers and you can try the sampler...
5
I believe the above statement is true for a man made structure anyway. Feel free to correct me.My sister and her husband took my wife and I here for lunch, when we visited last year. The food was amazing; simple, creative, delicious and service was excellent. It was only topped by the brewed on site range of beers. My brother -in-law and I had the tasting platter with our meal and they were all unique and delicious. We had a pint afterwards out on the balcony, which has amazing views over the city and the bay.A very enjoyable afternoon, which led onto an amazing night on the town
3
...that about covers the good points. Perfect spot to see Marina Bay from the air. You are nearly on the same level as the Marina Bay Sands platform, so it gives a new perspective not too often seen. As for the rest of LeVeL33......We were informed on entry that lunch had ended and only beer snacks were available. Not a problem and we ordered lamb ribs, belly pork and fat fries. The dishes were served on boards (Ã  la Jamie Oliver c. 2010). The fat fries were fine (even if they, like boards, are also a little hackneyed, these days) and the pork was succulent, but lacking seasoning. The lamb ribs lived up to their name in that there were rib bones with the dry remnants of overcooked lamb desperately trying to cling to them. These were served with a smear of hummus and a dish of tzatziki, the latter providing nothing to the lamb other than to perhaps drown any remaining flavour (you may be able to tell, I was not impressed). All the dishes were overpriced for what was delivered. I am not a beer drinker, but my husband did not enjoy the lager as he said it had a strange sour flavour. Difficult to knoe if this was the nature of the drink or perhaps it was coming to the end of its run.The staff could do with some training. At reception the two staff greeting were not welcoming and other staff appeared to spend a lot of time chatting with each other, rather than attending to the paying guests. LeVeL 33 could do better, especially for the prices charged. I don't go to a place to be charged for the view, which is basically what is happening here
5
This place was really great for dating or to impress your so.great for. Great for tourist and locals alight :)
5
This is the best place for a few drinks and enjoy the view of Singapore. You can see the entire marina area and surrounding areas.
5
Had Ming serve us all night, started off at stand up bar overlooking the bay ... awsome view. Then moved inside by the window for a great meal and great service... highly recommended
5
Went for dinner and beers and was not disappointed. Steak was lovely and beers generally good, the IPA was best. Went to an outside table for desert and what an incredible view - made it a special night. Not for those on a budget!!
5
The food ir very well done! Very fresh. Salad, cheeses , breads and other delicious sides are available as well. The view is stunning!! Really appreciate the service and kindness of the staff. Great experience!
4
Unless you can have a table outside or along the window front, I would not suggest dining at Level 33. To enjoy the utterly spectacular views, particularly of the nights lights, we thought the menu pretentious, our meals were over-cooked, and the prices high. Inside diners have to wait (hope) for an outside table to become available to continue on with coffee or a night cap. No table view, no go!The restaurant's other selling point is an on-site brewery, for which I believe stand-up space and snacks at the bar are available
5
Being there first time for company dinner.Wonderful roof top view to Marina Bays.Food is really good as well not like others roof top resto that just selling the view.Services was very nice and all served nicely including the dessert.Certainly will back again durinf next visit to Singapore
5
We had dinner here on our last night in Singapore. We chose it because it had views and the menu seemed to be reasonably priced for such a venue. We were a bit hesitant having read past reviews on poor service but we could not fault the attention we received. It was our anniversary and the staff provided us with a special dessert to mark the occasion. The food was great (entree average S$25 main S$40 excluding beef). Wines started at S $80++ and although as Australians we found this a lot, we were prepared. The views were great overlooking the Marina Bay area and city. Have rated 5 star as the evening did exceed our expectations.
5
No booking in advance, no entrance fee, a bit hard to find, but the view is amazing! Ask for the table outside, you will see all marina and the skyscrapers, fantastic! The prices are higher but not very high, have nice selection of beer and snacks. Great spot for a drink with friends! ;)
4
Nice place to chill out. It's in a office building at 33rd floor. It's not a huge place but I have never had any issue to get a standing table at least. They have a restaurant but I mainly came there only for drinks. You will get a nice view to the city and MBS. It's quite windy from time to time there so you will get refreshed. Staff are nice and helpful. They are brewing their own beers which are quite nice. There is no fee to come up. You will only pay what you are ordering. I recommend this rooftop if you want to chill out with your friends.
4
Great view but honestly overpriced for the quality of the food. You go there for the view and the trendy ambiance mainly.
1
I had dinner and wanted to have more drink at bar area
I asked staff to have drink at outside table
I do not know why he was angry
"ask me go and ask waiter inside restaurant"
service is sooooo bed
4
Food and Drink service was excellent,when we were done with our meal,we were ushered to the balcony to enjoy the view and drinks for the rest of the evening even without requesting.
5
I enjoyed a lunch with eight friends at this restaurant.
The restaurant offers many of their own beers brewed in house.
The restaurant has great food and service and the view of Singapore is fantastic.
4
I've been here during my first visit in Singapore to enjoy happy hour time with an amazing view but mainly to have the only and best craft beer in Singapore (this is what some "beer-addicted friend" suggested me before reaching Singapore).I have to say the beer is quite good, they have 4-5 major kinds (Lager, IPA, House Porter, Stout and Wheat); I tried IPA and Stout, I have to say that they seemed a little bit "light" compared to the one you could find here in Europe, the flavour (I'm not talking about alcoholic degrees) was not so full and strong as I was expecting, but anyway they seemed me the best "beer solution" in Singapore.The food was really tasty, we took 2 main starters (Ploughman's Board and Seafood Medley - I posted a picture) really good quality food! Then we ordered several kind of beef which seemed all delicious, I took the Kangaroo one :) and it was delicate, sweet, really flavoured. I enjoyed it a lot.The personnel is really clever, kind and accurate.I'm not an expert about all Singapore night locals but to me seemed quite fair quality/price level
2
We were recommended a visit to level33 for the laser show and drinks. Rainy weather and a concert near marina bay made the most disappointing visit of the entire trip to Singapore. Pre booked outside but due to rain they cancelled the booking with no seats inside so you need to take a gamble of the weather. Great view of the Marina area. Maybe just visit for a drink and not a SG$60 charge per person for a reservation.
4
Came to Level33 with business colleagues for dinner. The view from the outside dining area is one of the best in Singapore.....an absolutely unimpeded view of the marina and north east cityscape. It's apparently the highest "urban craft brewery" in the world, so something a little different from the other bars in the city. The service is very good, the food is excellent and the wine list extensive. The beer is a bit sweet and each style tastes kinda the same but its definitely drinkable and hard to complain about given where you're drinking it!!Will be going back.
4
Given it is located downtown financial district, what was interesting was that they are quite relax in terms of dress code. You see folks with ties, dinner wear while others are in T-shirts/bermudas Food is on the pricey side but if you can secure a balcony skyline view, it is well worth it
5
We had dinner at Level 33 last nite-very good food and beer selection. The sizzling plates and octopus was as our starter...great lamb ribs. Then we had cote de boeuf and beef rump, asparagus, heirloom tomato salad, chips.Will go back for sure to have another good nite of food and a stunning view
5
I had a great experience and our waiter was on point. He recommended my starter and main and was spot on both times. I had the wagyu beef carpaccio for starter which was delicately done, but the winner was the lamb cutlets with a truffle reduction and fresh figs. The flavours of this dish were terrific. Careful of their brewed pumpkin ale as can leave one more hungry
4
It has located marina bay financial centre tower1
You take the elevator reach direct level 33
If you want to just seeing marina bay sands no need to reservation. You should try drink beer soooo awesome
4
Food was good, service was attentive to customer too. Had a good business meeting with my client. will be back soon.
2
I am just going to summarise my experience for that night.1. Call for service and got ignore as the same server i called walked pass my table and did not attend to me.2. Had to remind the server to bring out my wine as i requested the wine to be served together with my main course and yet when my main course arrive i had to remind them to bring out my wine.3.asked for the bill, before they present the bill to me they actually closed it without me checking. And also waited for quite a bit for the bill.For the good price they are charging. I believe the service has to be on par together with the food
5
Getting to LeVeL 33 with it being in tower 1 at Marina Bay Financial Centre can be challenging. But finally decided to go and I'm glad I did. Yes if you wanted to sit at a table to dine then you need to book. But to walk up and have a beer in the outside stand up area is still great.The microbrewery concept really works with the 3 beers I tried all were excellent. The service can be a little slow but overall the staff are friendly and helpful. The bar food was limited but was perfect for drinking beer with and by Singapore standards good value.The highlight, of course, is the view over Marina Bay and it creates the perfect ambience for a perfect drink
3
View of the mbs was really nice! tallest urban microbrewery... Service was not all that great for the price of beers..kitchen closes on the dot(no last order notification) at the CBD went on a weekday to bring a Friend who was visiting Sg... the lift was really slow to get up there to level 33
4
We have been here a few times now and always enjoy having drinks over looking the Marina Bay. It was really busy both times we went and wished we had booked a table for drinks as you can't always get a table with a view. The beer is pretty good too
4
Love the view on top of one of the building of MBFC by having a drink outside on the balcony of the restaurant. The clue is where the SCB signage at the building.The food is good and the right portion.Need a reservation though otherwise you end up sitting in bar.It's a try if you have not been there
4
The view from this bar and restaurant is almost too spectacular to allow eating and drinking. I was blown away by the outdoor and indoor seating. I did not eat, but the bar service was attentive and friendly -- even when the bar was busy. The manager checked in with our party and made sure we were having a good time.
4
The view and atmosphere is excellent, for both indoor dining and outdoor section. The craft beer selection is great as well. Food is good. The only downside is the service. Some of the staffs are not very attending and hardly to see smile on their face, hope there will be improve on service standard
5
And the food and service are excellent too. Singapore is known for its fine dining establishments and Level 33 certainly should be at the top of any 'foodie's' list of favorites. Whether it is craft beer, fine wine or classic cocktails- the bar can handle it. The menu is modest, but each item is prepared perfectly and presented beautifully. A 'must visit' in Singapore
4
Visited restaurant on a weekday first their executive set lunch. Ambience was great with lovely view. On pricing, coffee was not included in the set (most establishments do). Thought that could be an area for improvement.
4
Nice views and a small but adequate snack menu from the bar. Great service and Singapore prices. We have a great experience the day we went.
5
The food at Level 33 is always delicious and the service staff are very professional, friendly and attentive. The views from the restaurant at night are worth the visit alone!
4
We thought it would be all about the views, but the food was pretty good (steaks, seafood). I had beer plank, with some reasonable beers and the wine by-the-glass was not outrageously priced.
And the views are pretty good...
5
The ambiance & the view is what drawn me back here again and again! Awesome cocktails, excellent dinner menu...I invite my overseas guests to LeVel 33 every time they come to Singapore.
4
This eponymous bar has to be literally the top microbrewery in town. On level 33 of MBFC, it offers a good selection of beers, bar food and to top it off, a great view of Singapore's skyline.
5
My ex-colleague and best friend took me to this place. It famous for its own brewed beers but it's not a beer night for me. I ordered the Full Blood Miyazaki Wagyu A4 and quite surprise of the size and plating. I'm a big man. But the first slice made me fall in love. The meat was so tender and rich in taste. The seasoning was just enough to let the meat become the hero on the plate. Not only tender, it's also very juicy. Must try. For the dessert I had Dessert Assiette and Zweigelt Wine. The dessert was just ok but the wine was so nice. Perfect nite with 33rd floor sky view of Singapore.
4
Perfect place to celebrate special occassion- truly a Fine Dining with relaxing ambiance.Upon arriving at Concierge I immediately see the row of Beer Tanks- seats apparently has window view outside.After having our Meal & Desserts - we are offered to seat at Terrace to enjoy the panoramic view of Singapore while having our Drinks.i was given a complimentary BDAY cake, baked in-house.Crew are good and FriendlyLovely experience
3
For past visits, i notice that there is a drop of service attention from the service staff. A few occasion , i need to walk up to the waitress/waiter to order my food and extra services . Waitress was not sure of wine recommendation when our client was looking for one.
3
Exorbitant pricing for ordinary tasting food. Had brittany cod which was rather tough and slightly more salty to my liking. Corn-fed poulet was tender and had an amazing flavor with the brine marinade and madeira jus. Blond lager was refreshing and gentle but many bars can serve such quality at lower price. Balcony view was great but overall food tastes ordinary for its price tags.
5
What a wonderful way to spend Mothering Sunday - Ming our table waiter was the best service I've had in Singapore as well as the Yorkshire pudding that came with my roast beef x best Sunday roast in Singapore without a doubt x
5
Top night excellent service by Anthony, knew his wines and made our night would go back and recommend to our friends
5
My Boyfriend enjoyed his birthday last May 11, 2017 on Level 33! The best night we ever had in Singapore, everything is Great! Truly a 5 star restaurant! ;)
5
Great food, the buffer sides are simply fantastic, but service need some improvement. Server got the orders wrong or need constant reminder.
2
as per many roof top in Singapore,be ready to over pay for average drink and poor food
but guess you go there as tourist for the view
not sure i want to try an other terrace.to be fair way better than 1 altitude
4
We had Sunday lunch. Some of the dishes were superb, such as the roast chicken, but others were middling. The sage and onion stuffing turned out to be more like white sauce, and the kids menu was over priced for pasta or 'dory' fish n chips which shouldn't be eaten by humans. Atmosphere and service was all rather pleasant.
4
It is pretty nice bar on the level 33. It has very nice view that you can see Marina Bay's Sands from a great view. Crowded, better to have reservation before. Would be nice if they put real seatings every part of the balcony, not just the reserved area.
4
Taking the private lift up to the 33rd floor felt like being in the tardis. The doors opened to a large warehouse/brewery/restaurant, with a beautiful view of Marina Bay and the famous hotel. My son who is living in Singapore wanted to take us to sample this restaurant's famous roast dinners. I was not disappointed. The food was very good. I was in a party of four. Three of us chose to share the leg of lamb which arrived at our table whole, for us to carve ourselves. It was enormous. My husband had the beef. The meat was beautifully cooked but the restaurant lost a star as I would have liked more veg. All in all a great place to visit.
3
We had booked Level 33 after hearing good things about the food. Overall the food was good but what we ordered came served nouvelle cuisine style (i.e. generally small servings) but nothing out of the ordinary in terms of taste or presentation. We tried several of their locally brewed craft beers which were enjoyable and the view is probably the best feature. Whether it was as good as it is made out to be is a matter of opinion. I was a disappointed but the restaurant was busy so others may have a different view. Strangely, I found it was difficult to get to the restaurant. Our taxi driver initially took us to the Marina Sands complex and staff there had never heard of "Level 33 restaurant" which was odd as we were told it was a well know Singapore eating destination. This was not a one off as friends travelling in a different taxi had the same experience of being dropped off at the wrong location. Fortunately we could access a map from the restaurant website and were able to find it. Its located in the financial district on the opposite side of the marina to the floating sports field.
4
Our family took the private elevator straight up to the restaurant. The large indoor dining area is bordered by a narrow corridor of outdoor dining terrace that overlooks Marina Bay and Downtown Singapore. Awesome views!We started off by having craft beers at the terrace. Having arrived in the late afternoon, we were able to enjoy the skyline as it changed from day to night. We ordered beer snacks and saved our appetite for dinner.As night fell, we moved inside to begin our dinner. The large wooden tables meant that each of us has lots of space to enjoy our meal. Our orders were served by friendly staff. They monitored our dinner progress and we chatted with them as they enquired about our feedback. The food was generally good and well plated. However, the bone-in leg of lamb was disappointing as it was very stingy on the meat. We were joking and debating if we should save the bone for our pet dog.In between our meals, we walked out to the terrace to enjoy the nighttime views which are breathtaking and mesmerizing!Menu items are on the pricey side but not excessive. However, the bone-in leg of lamb was a rip-off. For the price charged, the chef should have checked and stopped the dish from being served and replaced it with a better cut.All too soon, our hours long dinner was over. Overall, we had an enjoyable dinner
4
Very nice setting. Viewing deck is bit small but have great seating area. Beers are little more than average though to be honest.
5
Highest urban craft brewery in the world.
The food is upscale gastropub style. Awesome meet selection from around the world. The beer sampler is a great way to taste everything. By the way... The French fries are huuuge! So good!
5
This restaurant near the Marina has a lovely view and ambience.
The food was presented and tasted beautiful.
Is a lovely place for a romantic dinner, but we were there with a work group which was equally pleasant.
4
Excellent view and food. worth trying it at least once if you're in Singapore. Good service as well. They provided complimentary drinks bc the table was not ready when we arrive.
4
Went with my colleagues after work. Went there slightly before sunset so could see both the morning and evening view. The view of the bay was spectacular. Drinks were good too, and oh, the bread dip!
5
A must do! Restaurant with great views over the Singapore bay. Spectacular views.
The food and service are just excellent. Obviously a little more expensive, but once in a lifetime you should consider.
Highly Recommended.
2
I would not be there if it's not for business. Would pay for it and the food is like cheap cost. Wouldn't recommend my friends to try......
5
Great duck confit and beef appetizer. The beers were very fresh as well. Coupled with nice view it is great experience.
3
Very busy on a Saturday night. Almost all tables inside and outside were taken. Service was very slow and the waitress had a hard time coping with the amount of people there. Not sure why they don't double up on staff on busy weekends. Drinks are very expensive, can't comment on the food though. The views are spectacular and the atmosphere is nice. I think you should go once and enjoy the views, sort of like a 'been there - done that', but once is enough
4
Located on the top floor of one of the office building in the financial centre, Level 33 is perfect for a drink or two while enjoying the stunning view it offers from its outdoor terrace area. We came here late and only for drinks so I cannot comment on the food quality or selection. They have in house brewed beer but their wine selection is not as vast. This is probably a good chill out place for a party of no more than 6 people. The outdoor terrace area is rather narrow and does not offer good large tables for a bigger groups. The indoor area has plenty of space but will not give you the same view as if you were seated outside.
3
The views speak for themselves but menu as a whole is overpriced (the views are not free). Service good though.
4
Visited for drinks and view. Seating outside and we were not disappointed. View was great. Good place for beer, home brew selection.
3
I'm not really fascinated with the food as we went there on lunch, but definitely I would recommend to travelers to experience and see the perfect view of Singapore from this place.
5
Fabulous restaurant, fabulous setting. A lovely evening every time. Always attentive staff, great service.
1
Awful food , the lamb speciality for Sunday roast was probably the worst I ever had . The vegetables also terrible .
2
I have read several reviews that the food here is unsatisfactory. But I was thinking "hey, can't be that bad right?"Wrong.Aside from the starters (Scallops and Pig and Snail). Everything else was not even close to what I paid for. We had pan seared cod which tastes WAAAAYYY to unevenly seasoned (meat was rubbery and dry. Tasteless) and the Seafood Gambas' prawns were overcooked and rubbery... I have not had prawn that bad in a long time. And to think it's this pricey for this sort of a dish is amazing. But I have to give it to them. The view is awesome. But if you're there for the whole view in your camera. Make sure you have an EXTRA wide lens. My 19mm sigma lens was not enough. Oh and my seat was ant infested. *sigh* but I'll give them 2 stars since my starters were good.Side note: To sit outside (no air conditioning but you get to eat with a view), you are required to spend a minimum of 60 SGD per pax. Before tax
4
We arrived to find our reservation was for a table away from the windows. Because we were entertaining out of town guests, we wanted a table by the window and the hostess was able to accommodate us. The beer choices were explained and our questions about the food answered thoroughly. The food and beverages were wonderful. Our wait staff was attentive. As we lingered over our drinks, we were moved to an outside table for even more stunning views. Unfortunately we were seated near a group which had an obnoxiously loud fellow who was cursing and conversing on topics inappropriate for a restaurant of this caliber. We did not speak to management nor did we approach him, not wishing for a confrontation. Needless to say that put a bit of a damper on the evening and his salty language is a background commentary to our guests' videos
3
This place has a lot going for it in terms of location, service and the beer. I thoroughly enjoyed the beer and the views but all 16 of us were left questioning the quality of the food. The starters were a mixed bag. The attempt at being creative didn't work. The Angus Steak (like tar tar) was excellent so I gave that high marks. Everything else was layered in salt. The Cod fish was almost inedible with the amount of salt it had. We returned one portion. Even the salad with beetroot seemed to have a huge amount of salt. The deserts were, again, a good creative attempt but fell short. My desert somehow tasted smoked but was overly done and didn't blend at all with the white chocolate. There were 16 of us and no one really enjoyed the meal sorry to say.Based on that it was completely over priced in our collective opinion. The ambience was nice, the view spectacular and the service friendly but I wouldn't go again. I dont normally rate low as you can see from my numerous reviews unless I think something didn't live up to what I was charged for.
4
I am surprised at the recent reviews as we found the food interesting and the service attentive. The waitress, after taking our order returned to say she had discussed the Ploughmans Board sharing plate with the chef and decided it had too much pork on it. We had indicated that one of the party was allergic to pork. We appreciated the attention.The scallops were good and the beetroot salad interesting
3
Everybody goes to LeVel 33 for the great view and the beer. So I made a reservation, but when I arrived I was given an inside table, not even close to the windows. I asked about the outside tables and was told that for those you needed to call and there was also a minimum spending amount. But none of this was specified when I made the reservation. In addition, the food was overpriced. I should have gone without a reservation and had a beer with no food on the balcony. Once I finished eating and went on the balcony, nobody paid attention to me. I tried to get a waitress's attention to buy another beer, and she was quite abrupt.
5
Great food and drinks! The place brews their own craft beer. Excellent service and friendly personell. Proces are on the upper end bur rhats to be expected for such an amazing place!
1
The view from Level 33 ist fantastic, the Beer is ok, the small fingerfood as well. That's it... they collect Credit Card till leaving... they they to ask you for the next drink as soon as your Beer is half emtpy... very annoying... and they forbid and kind of tripod. I can understand, that big tripods are Not allowed. Because of this, I took a small gorillapod with me... this small Thing was forbidden as well... so in the end, i am very disappointed of this location! So Watch out and Look for alternatives
4
They offer different craft beers brewed at 33rd level! And this is the best part combined with the superb view of Marina Bar area. But this comes with a steep price. The price of the food is pretty high looking at the quality and quantity. We ordered starters and main courses and looking back we could have skipped the starters like the tartar, the carpaccio, and the leek. The tartar didn't have much taste, the carpaccio had too much mustard and the leek was only 2 small pieces. But let's be frank: the view is perfect and the staff is super friendly. We could move next to the window and could enjoy the desert (recommendable: dessert assiette) at the balcony. Considering this, the money is well spent and we can recommend this restaurant when you want to enjoy beer and dinner with a superb view
4
LeVeL 33 is a great escape from the chaos of Singapore. Perfect views from the balcony overlooking Marina Bay and the Marina Bay Sands. Great viewing spot for the light shows at 8:00pm, 9:30pm and 11:00pm although make sure you see it from the ground in front of MB Sands at least once while you are in SG. We have found the outside tables are almost always booked in advance. You can sometimes "negotiate" to have a seat there for a few minutes before the reservation time. You need to be assertive though or you will end up sitting inside and paying high prices for drinks without the advantage of the view. I strongly recommend calling ahead and make sure you ask for a balcony or outside table. You can still stand and take pictures but a table side view is much nicer of course. The lunch time brunch is reasonably fast if you have a business meeting you want to impress people. It comes with a salad bar, appetizers and your choice of entree from the menu. It is $$$$ but will absolutely impress your guests. Food at dinner is average quality but $$$$ so suggest lunch instead. Hopefully that helps

Yes you can jump in into my photo of the view from Level33. You have a great view of the Marina Bay Sands area. The atmosphere here i very relaxed especially of you're able to get a table in the open area. Me and my bf initially had a date here on a Thursday night. It was quite packed with people working in the Central Business Area. We got a table indoors and ordered some Angus Steak Chunks (not in the photo and I'm not sure what its called on the menu) for appetizers. We jumped into the mains with their version of surf and turf: fillet mignon and lobster tail and shredded lamb with gnocchi. Yes I'm simplifying the dishes because I can't remember their names. Haha My apologies but I have photos though. Now after a few days we went up again to Level33 this time with our friends. The beer sampler was a hit with the gentlemen (they actually brew their own beer) while their dessert sampler caught the palette of the ladies. The dessert sampler composed of beer ice cream, peppercorn chocolate ganache tart and a puff pastry with strawberry butter of some sort. The beer ice cream was my favorite
5
It took us a minute to find the actual entrance, but well worth it. Good service during lunch rush and the open table of apps and salad was very nice. After walking around the gardens by the bay this was a great place to sit down in AC and eat. Let's be honest, the reason we went here was for the view, but we were pleasantly surprised with the food and beer, plus service. Great place for lunch with a view in the bay area
3
Don't bother dining here. Just get a few drinks and stand outside on the balcony for the views and fresh air. It is amazing however the place is always full (of business people on weeknights and tourists on weekends). The drinks are on the expensive side as you'd expect. They are known for brewing their own beer which is an interesting concept and there are usually 4 or 5 available on tap. You can try all 5 on a tasting board... around $25 SGD but it's only 5x100mL so not very large.The beer cocktails are a rip off. Go for the normal cocktails instead.The sit-down dining experience can be skipped here (terrible with my dessert tasting like smoked salmon. It was supposed to be white chocolate and green tea mouse!). The bar food looked okay but we never tried it. Service is a bit uppity..
4
This restaurant was busy at lunch when we were there. Great ambience (being 33 floors up with fantastic views helped)! The Glare from the sun may be slightly uncomfortable so bring shades if you like.We had the executive set lunch which featured an adequate buffet spread of appetisers (eg mussels, prawns, cheeses, pasta salads and greens) and a choice of mains. I picked the spiced prawn salad which I thought was excellent - light and refreshing + meaty prawn.Service was also attentive and they try to go the extra mile (I liked the salad so much I asked for the recipe and they obliged)
4
We arrived about 6:30 pm without a reservation. So we couldn’t get a place on a table on the open air terrace, but it’s not a problem you can also stay outside to have the view. The beer was very good and we also ordered Fish and Chips. The friendly waiter was so fair to say that this is not Fish and Chips as we know it in Europe. It was just a portion of 8 chips and eight small fishes on every chip. The view especially to Marina Bay Sands Hotel is awesome
5
I went here at sunset for a meal and drinks. The food was excellent with really creative presentation. All slightly away from normal flavours but all excellent. The choice of beers is also great, I had the sampler with 5 different beers on it. Lovely I would recommend trying to get a table on the outside balcony but in any case this place has the best view in Singapore. It overlooks Marina Bay Sands and the Bay Area which is much better than looking out from Marina Bay Sands itself. If you do one thing when in Singapore, do this (better than a trip to Raffles)
5
Impeccable service. Friendly, attentive personnel. The food is of the highest quality. Great presentation, tasteful - good food overall. Amazing views, we really had a memorable experience.
5
went to this place with our client and my collegue, everybody was delighted. nice view and good beer. The place is a bit too far from the nearby station (raffles place) which is a pity. But overall, this place was nice.
4
Very nice view(especially night view), Beer is so delicious, staff are so kind.
The price is a little expensive.
4
We waited more than 30mins just for bread to be served. Food preparation are Too slow ! Dessert are worse , after clearing table waited for another 30 mins for a small piece of complimentary cake for 6 persons.
5
As always, our favourite view and atmosphere of the Marina Bay area. Great food choices and always good quality. Service is also outstanding.
5
When you have visitors stop in the first place to take them has to be here. The view is amazing (and free). The beers are pretty so-so, and the menu is fairly typical. But you can't go wrong with the ambience.
5
Nice experience there with Wife. Service is quite good and it is a extrem good place to view the Singapore famous place in the center of city
5
I had a chance to visit this place on January 2017.I hadn't expected anything before I went to this place. Eventually,level 33 became one of my fav place in Singapore meanwhile I've been to this country already 9 times and this place can be one of my favorite roof top bar. I don't know much about beer but my friend told me that it was superb especially a black beer(stout). They provide you a signature beer which come in 5 glasses of beer (in a small portion just 100ml for each glass) you guys should try that because really nice taste and nice decorationI'll be there again for sure if I have a chance to visit SG next tim
5
It's a restaurant at 33rd level and the name of the restaurant is LeVeL33. A non-stop lift is operating from level 1 to 33 for the restaurant guests. Reservations are highly recommended for dinner especially on weekends, public holidays and eve of public holidays. Sometimes the reservations are unavailable even 1 week earlier.The service of this restaurant is pretty fast and with high standards. We can get the different flavoured beers which are crafted at that restaurant. 5 out of 6 micro breweries are operating there and we can see which beer is from which brewery.Quality of food- no need to worry. We can give excellent rating. Their beer cocktails are nice- some are sweet too. Don't forget to walk to the open balcony of this restaurant and take the photos of Singapore. It's a bird eye view location for those who love photography. Price of this restaurant- yes, we are not having beer at level 1... we are at level 33.. so it is a bit high side, but comparing to the quality, quantity and the service standard, it's a value for money place. Must try items: their 5 types of craft beers, sweet beer cocktails, lamb cutlet, beef n reef (beef and lobster), T bone sharing, the lamb leg sharing etc.
5
I doubt you can get a much better view of the marina than from this bar, and with some very tasty craft beers on offer (we tried the blond lager and wheat beer) I would definitely recommend this experience. Try to time it right and go at sunset as the city comes alive with lights
5
Nice ambience with superb view. Wonderful beer, food and service. Definitely worth another visit or even more!
3
Food arrived cold and the beef was too fatty to be able to cut in to
View is nice but won't be returning
4
Great view and executive lunch set is good value. Buffet for starters has good choices. I would recommend it as a good place for lunch.
4
The executive set lunch is great value and very efficient for a business lunch. Cod cakes are pretty average but other options are good.
5
Excellent experience, great view, great food, good service, expensive but worth it, it is SIngapore.
1
Cod cake is terrible.. cannot taste the cod fish at all, the content is mostly mashed potatoes. The buffet lunch is mediocre.
4
The restaurant provides an amazing view of Singapore's favourite landmarks. Worth to go for a drink to enjoy it. It's not cheap but worth it. Entrance is a bit hidden so was good that locals showed the way. Booking table should be considered if you go on a bank holiday or during busy periods.
5
Went here one evening for drinks. The views from here a absolutely stunning. Really nice bar with very good beer and whisky. The guest Pilsner they had was delicious. Ended up having more than I should have! Didn't get to try the food, but it did look very tasty. Well worth a visit
5
This is a wonderful restaurant. The food and beer were excellent and the view of Marina Bay is breathtaking. Service in the restaurant is very good but when we went outside for drinks and dessert no one ever came to take our order. They lost a lot of money
1
Staff are haughty and think too Much of themselvesService is at par with Lau Pa Sat hawker center a block awayThe waitress kept coughing onto us and our food, while other attendants asked us to shift where we were sitting 2 times (despite reservation
4
Great food and atmosphere. Definitely worth the money. The food was not fantastic but the drinks, deserts, view and customer service is simply amazing.
4
This place which I introduce always if a friend comes from the overseas.And everyone has a meal always cheerily . The view of the our of a window is so nice.
5
Amazing view and very friendly and supportive staff. They serve self- brewed beer. You can choose between dining area or bar area. Bar area offers the best view but only bar finger food. But it is worth for view.
4
It was a pleasant dining and the ambience is good too. The service is good and was offered to go for outdoor seats after dinner is done.
4
Steak is slightly saltish. The rest of the food is delicious. Service is prompt not to mention that view outside the restaurant is fantastic
5
Really nice place to watch the city from. Look down of the little boats and sip a beer and relax. Moderately busy only on a Friday night.
4
A great place to try boutique beers while enjoying a high rise view of Marina Bay.I suggest trying the paddle of beers which provides a selection of the different beer styles on offer. pick your favorite and order a pint, the bar snacks are also good and go well with the beers
4
As always, you need to make a 3-week advance reservation to get a dinner sitting for 6. We were greeted with clear skies and every Singaporean proud is proud to showcase this beautiful skyline to our overseas visitors.We settled down quickly for dinner. The Wagyu steak, beef carpaccio, fresh scallops, gnocchi did not disappoint. Finished off with the white chocolate sweets. The only qualm is the price, a tad expensive however, will definitely be back. Thanks for the experience
1
Went there on a Saturday night with my girl friends. The service was very bad, the staff had a lot of attitude and would crack a joke every-time they made a mistake. I found them unpleasant and understaffed. The food was below average. The view was lovely but there are other places with similar view and better food/ service so Never going back to level 33.
5
The worlds highest brewery delivers super fresh beer that a beer drinker will love. If things could not get better.....they do. The view over the city is stunning. A great place to sip a drink and soak up the great city. If you eat you are in for another treat. I had one of the best meals I have ever had at LeVel 33. I recommend it to many of my friends and colleagues.
5
Great view and great place . Good food and good service. They try to accommodate also the single traveler. Thank you
4
Brewery on 33rd level with an amazing view. What more is there to say! Best to book ahead, as there is limited seating outside.
4
I thought there would be a trade off on the quality of the food for the view. I was wrong. The gambas was spectacular.
5
You cannot get bored of the views from this bar. It overlooks marina bay, the sands hotel along with all the famous singapore skyline. At night you can see the light show.The novelty factor being they have a craft micro brewery on the 33rd floor!RegardsOma
4
This brewery offers excellent views of the Marina Bay area and also offers a variety of beers not very expensive for what you get. Other places with worse views are more expensive and with worse service. Here the views are spectacular and the service is very amaiable and nice. Best time to go is around 6 so you can get a good table near the edge
4
Definitely a great place for bringing overseas guest for lunch to enjoy good food & great view. But be prepared to spend at least S$60+ even with set lunch. Service at the table was good but won't say the same for the staff welcoming at the entrance.
5
What a wonderful place. Seems hidden away but once found a breath of fresh air. The hospitality was fantastic. The food was to die for. The care and attention to detail was immaculate. From the so called simple hand cut chips which had the most amazing. flavour to the ribs, Everything was truly scrumptious!!
3
A sophisticated but relaxed spot with some of the best views in Singapore. We went for Sunday lunch as a family, and this place doesn't get 5 stars for two reasons: there are no baby chairs... for a Sunday lunch offering??? Isn't that odd? So we had to straddle the kids on our laps while dodging flying gravy fingers on our Sunday bests. Baby chairs would be a small investment for Level33 to do.The second reason was the roasted beef seemed to be a B grade cut. Some sinew, not cooked tender and the type of cut I would feed my pets. The portion was good, the rest was excellent, in particular the Yorkshire pudding, but the meat was a let down. Avoid the beef.Otherwise this is a nice spot for a good meal and good beers..
5
Magnificent signature pilsner & delicious food, served by amicable & efficient staff. Venue is tastefully furnished & provides patrons with a variety of seating arrangements. Views across Marina Bay are second to none. We visited on three occasions during the course of the week we stayed in Singapore & loved every minute of it
2
Had a table outdoors.. There's a min spend per person.. Staff did not inform us that kitchen was closing so we couldn't order more food to satisfy the min spending requirements.. Food portions miserable and pricey.. Fish n chips consisted of five or six small pieces of fish on six potato wedges.. In the end we're compelled to order a bottle of wine to take away to fulfill their min spend requirements.
4
The food is average. the atmosphere and the scenery is fantastic. The red wine recommended was very good and value for money.
5
Must visit! the food was delicious - best gnocchi dish I ever had! Corn side dish to die for. Our son devoured the steak. The views are gorgeous.
4
Brought an overseas friend there for the weekday Semi buffet lunch.. Remembered they had desserts on the buffet table? No longer so and selection seem less. Unlikely to return anytime soon. Not as good as i remembered.
5
Celebrated my friend's birthday. Fantastic view of the marina bay skyline. Service was prompt and staff offered us a seat at the terrace area to get a better look at the view outside 👍🏼👍🏼
5
Fabulous good, brilliant service, wonderful ambiance and a special setting. A definite "room with a view". Always worth a visit.
5
Excellent time at Level 33 - lovely ambience, friendly service, fantastic view and good range of food/drinks & of course, craft beers - good balance on all front My business associates from out of town were impressed and had a good time. Tip for a memorable time - make time for drinks outdoor before and after dinner - arrive before sunset to catch view of the bay and after sunset to catch the beautiful city lights
1
I am amazed that this place is busy other than for the view from outside overlooking Marina Bay. The prices are outrageous and then they have the cheek to add taxes & service, the beer is no better than a very bland pint of Coors Light and the service is slow and miserable. Sorry, a place for shallow, look at me, must be seen here people; certainly not for us. The beer at Brewerkz in Clarke Quay is outstanding in comparison to this place and it's full of genuine people
3
Was there for Vday but so happens that they forgot our order. They served other customers and I felt embarrassed sitting there with my girlfriend while seeing people who came later than us eat. If I hadn't gone to the counter and raised my voice, I bet my food won't have arrived even an hour later. Do hope this service is a one off thing
5
Yes indeed, who could imagine that sitting atop the Marina Bay Financial Centre in Singapore's biz district was a working Micro-Brewery - called LeVel 33???I came back for lunch with a Deloitte Partner to discuss some mutual client business, and we were delighted to enjoy the fresh anti-pasto starters with a glass of delicious Cab Sauv Merlot for me and Chardonnay for my friend He had a succulent cod risotto (of which nothing was left) and I selected the special burger - which I enjoyed without the bun (don't need so many carbs) - and gosh it was filling ...The view and ambience was breathtaking and a little distracting - but enjoyable just the same!!We closed with some cheese and fruit which rounded off a great lunch, discussion and interaction!!
4
From the outdoors you have a awsonme view of Marina Bay Sands, specially at night, when you can appreciate lights of big city and laser show. Beers are great and place really worthwhile a visit. As Level 33 is located in Financial Area and just in front the most touristic place of Singapore, place is visited by a mixture of tourists and high-flyers at happy hour.Ham's tips:- if you want to go outdoors, book your table in advance;- if you like beers, try the sampler. I specially liked the IPA;- kitchen is open until 10:30pm- it is not a speak easy site, but they do not spend money in marketing (probably all budged was allocated to rent the place). To get there, just go in the ground floor in LOOK THE STANDARD CHARTERED building
5
The restaurant has an amazing view. The staff provided great service. The cod i ordered was tad expensive for the portion and taste. I had a great time with my friends and we will go back again.
5
Went there for a quick beer and was not disappointment. The Spot has an amazing vier over the Marina Bay and the beer was good. Did not pay so I cant comment on the Price. Definitely a good spot to show to Singapore visitor.
4
We visited Level 33 after overhearing someone speaking about its existence. As we wanted to site on the terrace and see a view of the City skyline without any particular interest in the restaurants at the Marine Bay Sands, we thought we would give it a go.We opted to book in for drinks and snacks option, which required a minimum $60 spend. I had reserved a spot for 8pm, but unfortunately through no fault of our own the table wasn't available at this time. Despite confirming our booking verbally over the phone and having a record on their booking system, they could not confirm that we would get a booking once we arrived, which was slightly concerning, however, the Manager apologised and offered to waive the charge for the first drink and the minimum spend. I was quite happy to accept this, and by 8:30 we had taken our reserved table. The service thereafter was great, and I apologised for being a bit impatient.The food and drinks are expensive, but that sums up Singapore in general. As it was our honeymoon, it didn't bother us too much. I tried the tasting paddle, and had a couple of extra drinks from the selection. The snacks we tried were decent and tasty. The porter was a particularly good beer, but more of a 'sipping' beer.With the terrace/balcony view, this does come at the price of other people taking photos against the city backdrop. If you don't like this happening, this place isn't for you. We were happy to oblige, but this wouldn't be for everyone
4
The view and location are truly spectacular, especially if you can be outside (careful of the wind). While I didn't eat much, the food was fine but didn't seem great. The beer was somewhat disappointing from a "real brewery" perspective, but probably a little better than just drinking Tiger
5
Our first morning after arriving in Singapore, our guests took us to Level 33 for brunch. It was a great way to begin our stay. We ate indoors and then spent time on the balcony overlooking the city. The view is fantastic.The food was delicious. There was a wide variety of options for everyone in our party. It was quite satisfying and a perfect way to combat jet lag. Everything that I tried was tasty
5
On the 33rd floor in central business district of Singapore. There is a fantastic view of Marina Bay and the Marina Bay Hotel which is unbelievable at night. The service is relaxed for such a classy restaurant and the choice and quality of dishes are excellent. This is a micro brewery also so their beer selections to accompany certain dishes is useful. HIghly Recommended. Not the cheapest but good value
4
We didn't eat, just had a drink out on the balcony, but the service was great and the view is absolutely amazing. Would recommend heading up just for that! The setting is really cool, you can see aspects of the brewery as you walk through. I can't actually remember the name of the beer I drank, but it was really good, I had 2 more. It's very expensive, but alcohol in Singapore is anyway and I would say it's worth it for the view you have. You can see the Supertree light show (can't hear the music obviously) and you can also see the Marina Bay light show. Tiny little critique is that the lift takes forever (I know it's 33 floors up but I stayed 49 floors up at MBS and the lift only took half the time) and it gets very crowded as there's only 1
4
Had drinks here before dinner and it is a nice venue. Had seats just near entry where you could not see too much but it's more comfortable. You can still have a drink in the main bar area with a prime view, but get there early (6pm or earlier) or reserve with a minimum spend. You can chance it for the terrace and am sure you can get a table by just having a drink in the area and waiting if one is. It immediately available. Great views of downtown Sing, and very good drinks and craft beers - sort of reasonable prices.
5
We attended this establishment on a Monday afternoon. Knowing it has its own brewery it's a good place to kick off for a day on the lash!Please know the lift takes a little longer than most but hey it's 33 floors upGreat views to be had, good beer and wine! I suspect good food, but we did leave to visit the local Hawkers Mall for lunch
4
We live in Singapore for a few months now and we finally went to Level33 last weekend. Food: really good quality for the money. Service: lovely people and more service and knowledge then we usually expierence in the city. Drinks: IPA is approved and a good wine list. View: after dinner we could sit outside and we looooved the view
1
Experience bad service at the restaurant and came across 2 bad waitress unfriendly attitude (believe they are from Phil.)
4
Had beef and reef and Gnochi. Would have been better if there's picture to depict the food. Didn't expect the Gnochi the way it was. Too much adventure for me.
5
Party of 3, perfect for business conversation. Not too packed and high quality food that facilitates executive timing and preference. Definitely go back again for luncheon. The view won't hurt too. Nice touch from the crew who prepared a surprise birthday cake. Thank you!
4
This place has great view but I feel it's too very pricy and variety/taste of beers they serve is just Ok.
4
Overall experience is good. Sunday lunch is very quiet, the menu is limited, food is standard bar food, nothing to shout about, but acceptable, pricing wise average, slightly on the high side - for the view I guess it's worthwhile.
3
It has good view - going out to the deck, you can see Marina Bay area. However, the quality of the food should be improved - seafood like prawn, gravlax & salad was good, Weak in desert & warm food section.
3
You can not deny the view is amazing. The staff were good. The food was average but not amazing. My steak was mostly fat and tasteless and had to be smothered with their secret sauce. The sides were good and starter pretty good too. Restaurant is trying to come off as a high end restaurant but probably inundated with tourist crowds and related chaos. There were people in shorts t-shirts and such ... maybe if they tone that down the place might live up to the hype
5
This restaurant is an absolute 'must' .. we went there twice within a week ..once for dinner and the other time was for a sun-downer - Management is highly professional ...staff are motivated and friendly ..therefore it is not surprising this place is popular ...1. If you are into beer ..their micro brewery produces amazing authentic flavors ..their brewmaster went to Weihenstephan in Bavaria , and what you have here is really outstanding beers. 2. An interesting menu with a variety of choices for every taste ..3. The service was attentive and really friendly ..The added benefit of Level33 is the amazing view over Marina Bay ..You do need to book ahead if you want a table .
4
I have been to Level 33 a couple of times, and have always ordered their beers. Their in house brewery offers a variety of light and dark beers, and its easy to find one for each taste buds. The porter and stout are my personal favorites. The thick chips are yummy, but they could offer more vegetarian options to go with their beers. Try and book for an outdoor seat in advance, its totally worth it
4
If ever I have friends coming into Sg for a few days, I bring them here. Great beers brewed in house. Food/nibbles are great as well. Strongly suggest you book and go outside, there is a minimum spend, but is well worth it. This is just a must
4
- Amazon view over the City, Marina Bay Sands ...
- marvelous outdoor terrace
- excellent draught beer
- good snacks ( a bit light of you're really hungry and when the restaurant area is closes)
- very nice atmosphère
5
Really good place with one of thw bwst views in the city of views. The beer i locally brewed and taste mostly great. Pricy thou so go when there is happy hour
5
Food was great as ever... This was my second time patronising Level 3... Standards of service staff still remain top one.
4
Good location to have a nice view of the night scenery. Food is good. A good place for a romantic date for couples.
4
Level 33 has become one of our favourite places to bring guests when they are visiting Singapore. Always a beautiful view, especially at night. After our meal, we had prime seats for the laser light show from MBS.
5
I came here for beers and I was blow away with the beautiful skyline of marina bay sands. Highly recommend people to check this place out ^^
5
A friend of my father's recommended we get drinks up at Level 33 on our trip to Singapore. Great recommendation! The beer was good but the views were better. It's located in the Marina Bay Financial Center (Tower 1) and has its own private elevator. We didn't eat while we were there but the menu looked good as well.
5
Level 33 is a must-visit in Singapore for those looking for a good night out with friends and family or a romantic date with that special someone. The ambience is modern, chic and classy. The view of the marina bay, surrounding buildings and scenery is the best in Singapore in my opinion. It doesn't get any more spectacular than this. Make sure you go out onto the balcony for the full impact. We didn't have dinner but we did order a few appetizers and they were good. Oh and a must-mention is their craft brewery. Level 33 is the world's highest brewery. They make several beers that will suit any taste. Try their beer sampler. And for the ladies, order one of their beer cocktails. Sooo good
4
This is a micro brewery in the sky. It serves a variety of beers all of which are excellent. We visited on the Sunday so beef, pork, lamb, chicken vegetarian options , fish were on the menu. Prices are not cheap but the food is of good quality. Service comes with a smile. What makes this place stand out is the fantastic views of the city and bay. You can walk out ono an outside terrace and have drinks there providing the weathers good. Good place to visit for an aerial view of Singapore
5
Went to visit this restaurant while in Singapore after it being highly recommended. I have to admit I was a bit wary as so many people had recommended it that it may be more hype than substance. I can safely say I am glad I was very wrong. The food was amazing I had steak which was just so succulent. The service was outstanding everyone went out of their way to ensure the experience was special. And then as if the food and service was not enough there was the fantastic views of the Singapore skyline lit up at night. I would 100% recommend this restaurant has one you must see and experience while in Singapore
4
Beers before 8 are well priced
Food was very good and had a table by the window for a view of MBS and the harbour
Service was hit and miss though!
5
Excellent meal, beef roast with Yorkshire pudding was amazing!
Took a long time for the food to come but when it finally did it was great.
Views from the restaurants are breath taking!
3
Good customer service but food wasn't worth the price. We have fish kangaroo and pork. The craft beers were really good.
4
Lunch buffet spread was good, though there was hardly a desert selection (only fruits and some cheese available). Perhaps there could be an addition of one or two options. Service was great.
1
Went there on a spontaneous personal visit in a gloomy Sunday early evening, for snacks and drinks. Were rejected at the entrance. Even though the space is fairly empty, the receptionist told us that everything was booked, including every single seat by the bar. And she asked us whether standing on the terrace is OK for us. I was shocked they found such an option decent enough to even speak of, especially for an empty and quite place like this. Meanwhile we did see other guests coming from the terrace to the lounge area grabbing their own drinks, and my friend told me that they did the same last time. I suspect that this is some weird strategy of theirs. In the end, the receptionist did not offer us any other option than standing on the terrace forever, so we left. After reading other reviews, I felt that we've made the right decision, and I will be careful not to bring any business partners here
4
We enjoyed the executive set lunch here on a Thursday. Service was good and attentive, the buffet was fresh and varied and the craft beer cocktails were different and tasty. We both ate battered fish and fondant potato. A different take on fish and chips which was interesting. High quality fish. Once the meal was finished the staff were happy to let us spend some time out on the balcony admiring the amazing view, taking snaps and finishing our drinks. Would recommend.
4
Went for a casual dinner and a beer, but was quite impressed with the complexity of the menu. Certainly more than I was expecting for a microbrewery. Terrific view of the bay and while more stylish than I expected, I found the experience very relaxed and enjoyable
4
bar has happy hour which finishes at 8pm, IPA beer was tasty and my wife and daughter had G&T's I noticed that they had a bottle of NZ Sauvignon at $SG 80 which is not bad bearing in mind the location and views. I found the service to be very good, and the bar snacks looked tasty. If you have limited time in Singapore and want some iconic views level 33 will fit the bil
5
No. 1 - We made a fussy complaint upon our arrival yet the receptionist responded to us very politely.No. 2 - The staff is very patient and helpful in giving recommendations although we had a difficulty in selecting our dessert.No. 3 - Our request has been granted. They allocated us to outdoor seating after meal!No. 4 - The staff knows how and where to take photo for customers!No. 5 - We requested a candle from the waitress upon the arrival of out dessert. After 5 minutes she came back with a new cake with candle
5
I came on the weekend for a late lunch and enjoyed the view over the Bay with a great glass of wine.Again, I got surprised by the great creations on the new menu. It tasted exquisitely and was beautifully arranged.Service was great - the staff from reception to the floor is just lovely.Regardless if I come for business or pleasure, Level33 never lets me down
4
The view maken this restaurant special as Well as the self brewed beer. Service is a bit to tight. Food is excellent but pricy.
4
One of the best place to view Sands Hotel and Marina Bay.
foods are not quite impresive. ans little bit crowded feeling for fine dining.
However view from terrace is something you can't miss.

A visit here is worth the while, for beer lovers! Nicely curated wine list which is not the usual! Had a glass or their rose which is refreshing! Pork belly and sizzler beef both nice cook!
4
The staffs are very friendly and helpful. The food is very nice, not to mention the view is perfect...Highly recommend this place!

In house beer was fantastic. Above all the food and drinks, the view from the outdoor seating really worth it all.

Ming was our server, and his excellent hospitality was the highlight of our evening. He's a superstar with spot-on food recommendations, switching tables for a view during dessert, arranging a birthday surprise, and customized drinks on the house. The lamb is to die for. Thank you, Ming, for making such a difference

The first surprise is that this restaurant has its individual elevator in the building! We even didn't need to remember on which floor it was. The second surprise is the beers that they have and special dishes and beer cocktails! We spent about SDG $240 for a sharing beef, 2 beer cocktails, 2 soup, and some starts for 2 people. The quality of the food is good! It is pity we didn't try the set with 5 types of beer. From the balcony we saw the whole Maria Bay area and CBD, really good view! We went for lunch, but we believe the view in evening will be wonderful

Made Reservations at level 33. After Having asked 3 people how to get there, I finally found the personal elevator up the the 33th Floor. The menu is more basic, mainly filled with grill and beer, since it is of course a brewery. I had the australian steak (S$48). It was delicious. I first did not know you had to take all your sides separately. So I got my steak solo. But the waitress immediately came to help and made sure I had my sides within 2 minutes. So nice experience, worth the extra dollar.

I guess if it is difficult to get a booking, the management can stick to what they are doing.We were "squeezed in" for dinner only by going to the restaurant during the day and asking if it was possible to get a table. The most helpful girl on reception found us a table at the second sitting. There was no chance of a booking over the phone. I was therefore somewhat surprised to see several empty tables while we were dining at the second 8pm sitting.What saved this establishment from me giving it an "average" rating is the food and the view. The negatives were the snobby verging on rude attitude of the wait staff, the small wine list with my chosen wine unavailable, and the huge mark up on the wine.I chose a Chateau Neuf de Pape and was told it had sold out. A sophisticated establishment would have conceded to serving the only other GSM style wine [which was $10 more expensive] at the same price. I requested this but was declined. I got the impression that the waiter knew nothing about wine. This drops the rating for this restaurant from "excellent" to verging on "average".A bottle of Rockford Alicante Bouchet which I purchase in Australia for just over $20 was on the wine list for just under $100. This seems like an excessive mark up to me, even allowing for transportation and other costs.The good aspects which lead to a "very good" rating; the view is superb. One can drink one of LeVeL 33's craft beers on the open air balcony looking over Marina Bay and the spectacular Marina Bay Sands triple tower hotel. There is an unobstructed view of the laser light show. Best of all was my steak, Australian Rump. This was beautifully cooked and full of flavour. The sides, kipfler potatoes, asparagus, and pumpkin were very well presented and most tasty. Accompanying diners had the lamb and the pork. All were impressed with the quality of their food.So, food 5 stars; view 5 stars; wine price, wine choice, waiters wine knowledge 2 stars: craft beers 4 stars; wait staff attitude 3 stars

There's a nice view over the city skyline but it depends on the weather. Due to rain, the whole outdoor terrace was closed. Interesting place with their own beer brewery. The sirloin and ribeye steaks we ordered didnt taste fantastic (for the price). Maybe can try Saturday brunches or go when the weather is good. Not family friendly as they don't provide baby seats.
3
The food is okay but nothing amazing. You mainly pay for the view. Good for a drink with friends visiting if you are nearby. But doesn't beat other rooftops view.
5
Quaint and good. A micro brewery on the 33rs floor! Only in Singapore. Good choice of food. Excellent steak. A little expansive but that's Singapore.
3
Took my boss who was visiting from London plus a senior business associate as I wanted to showcase best of Singapore. The views are certainly worth it and layout and ambience vibe are cool and buzzy. However, when we ordered our waitress quite aggressively questioned all of our choices, repeatedly. It was the oddest thing and first time that has happened. We all laughed about it but it didn't impress and caused a few raised eyebrows. Starters were fine. Mains disappointing. Fortunately my boss' steak was fine but the fish was not seasoned at all and my main of lamb with gnocchi was just wrong, a sticky inedible mass consisting mainly of raisins and currants. Had to leave most of it The chef needs a refresh and to review food before it leaves the kitchen. Pls train your wait staff. Will not be going again. I've had the bar snacks and drinks before at a corporate event which were good but dinner was a disaster for the price paid.
2
Poor service and very average food. Dinner arrived cold and potatoes were not properly cooked. I sent this back and it did come back warm but potatoes still not properly cooked.This Restuarant advertises itself as market and specialising in Sunday Roasts but they were a Long way off of the mark
1
We went to LeVel 33 yesterday afternoon to have some drinks with friends for our farewell gathering. We thought it would be a nice closure for our experience in Singapore. Unfortunately the entire experience was terrible. We went to ask for a table at the reception and the lady at the counter brought us in the restaurant and she looked lost, making eye contact with other staffs and they were chatting among themselves on where to seat us. Then she said "sorry no table" after 10 minutes! Shouldn't they know whether there are seats/table available beforehand? We saw many tables available but they mentioned the area is close for dinner set-up (we were there early afternoon). We told them we only needed 1-2 hours because we have other function to attend but they hesitated to provide a table for us. Finally they agreed to accommodate us.There was a staff who took our orders and was "pretending" to be nice but he was talking behind our backs in Malay language, failing to realize that one of us understands the language. He was complaining to his colleagues that we were ordering snacks and about other customers. The service was bad and the staffs here all seemed miserable to work there and we feel they are only pretending to be nice. Perhaps they should be sent for acting classes so that they don't make it obvious to customers that they hated serving customers. WORST experience ever and we do not recommend others to go there. We will never return to Level 33
2
Level 33 offers a superb view of Singapore's skyline and as a micro-brewery, the beer is very good. However, the food is unfortunately below par and comes at a premium. We dine out frequently and have no qualms whatsoever in paying a premium for great food. The food at Level 33 was poor on so many levels, to name a few: over-cooked steak, poorly seasoned and bland throughout, one-dimensional menu and lackadaisical service. It's a shame, as the venue is great.Best advise here is go and enjoy the fantastic beer brewed on-site, enjoy the view ... but eat elsewhere to avoid being truly disappointed.

From this bar you can see the Marina Bay Sands from a new angle. There is a separate elevator that goes to the bar. If you don't have a reservation for dinner you can only stand outside but the view is better anyway. The choice of beer was ok. But the prices were even for Singaporian circumstances a bit high. The Fish and Chips was a joke. For one beer while overlooking the MBS this bar is ok but the food and the prices don't justify to stay there for more than one hour
4
The service was good. Was served by Azri who took his time recommend food to best pair with drinks. Went there a bit early hoping to catch sunset but the restaurant itself is not sunset view, but the Night view is beautiful! The place gets crowded later in the evening so do expect some patrons taking pictures next to you if you're seated outside
5
I have dined in Atmosphere in the Bruj Kalifa Dubai, so I am not just talking about heights. LeVeL33 in Singapore actually in my opinion beats Atmosphere because of the vibe, view, food and beverage on offer. LeVeL33 offers craft beer and beer dining menu's that will not blow a hole in your pocket. I had a taste of craft beer, sizzling king prawn, and angus beef....that gave me a great taste and view for S$89 (three people)...now thats great value for this place. Its a must go if you are a foodie or a thrill seeker! Great value...entrance is free. Dont go on weekends without bookings! I think a weeke day sunset experience is great!
4
A great rooftop bar on the 33rd floor tower 1 Marina Bay Financial Centre. Get there early if you want an outside seat. Neat shorts and T shirt fine. Drinks expensive, particularly the thimble fills of wine they serve but that's just Singapore for you.the food looks good.After your drink it is a five minute walk to La Pasat food market. A perfect night out
4
Like the scenic and able to chill out with friends. The food is nice and tasty. One more places to meet up. Enjoyable time!
5
They provide their own beers, you should try! You could also smoke at high level,and not every bar provide this kind of privilege. You should booking in advance to get the best view
3
You will be amazed by the scenic view
Great selection of local brews, with my preferred light dark (lightly chocolate)
But the food is small in portion, not very sophisticated but a rather expensive bill
Not to be missed at sunset
Cheers!
5
We always take guests to Level 33 for the sunset views which are always spectacular. This visit the food was also great. Tasty and well cooked. Its very sophisticated pub food done with style.
4
I would say it is worth a trip up. Dinner was pricey and service was ok. We asked to move tables. It didn't go over well, but they did move us to the better table. Food was good. The main attraction was the view. It was spectacular and we took some great pics
4
The most amazing restaurant in terms of a view , we had a lovely night. The New Year's Eve package was expensive but included meal , drinks and photos on the way in. It wasn't crowded - very generous with drinks free pouring wine / beers. The meal was good - nice buffet and meat decent. I think it was worth it and would recommend. Staff friendly , some a little too much ( nice to be left alone to eat) We had a lovely night and it was spoilt a bit when about 10pm we were enjoying the view on the balcony having paid Â£500 and looking forward to the fireworks. We were approached by a member of staff who asked if we could move seat as there was a 90 year old woman coming to watch the fireworks. As sympathetic as we were I refused to move as this night was special for us and we actually got engaged at midnight!. I just couldn't believe that the staff thought another customer was more important than us just by virtue of age . Nevertheless the elderly woman sat next to us and appeared to have a lovely night with a gang of about 10 relatives surrounding her making us feeling very awkward for not moving ! Great venue, good food let down by thoughtless service..... we still enjoyed ourselves and got engaged under the fireworks with the most amazing view ( nearly deprived at the last minute but for my assertiveness!
2
Lovely bar/restaurant however we were seated in far back corner in front of wine fridge as we were a large party (x5 guests; not that large really). Disappointing mainly as reservation made approx 3-4weeks in advance & surrounding tables at the window were left vacant. Despite poor table location the starter Share Plates (both meat & seafood) were really deliscious
4
We booked a table just for drinks, outside on the balcony with a view of the bay. The view is amazing! For this there is a minimum spend, which was easily met. The beer cocktails were great, but I do think that the beers could be a bit more exciting...especially the Wheat beer, which was a bit watery
5
I have patronised LeVel33 numerous times, in recent years.I never tire of their food, nor the gorgeous view of Singapore's city skyline from this inviting restaurant.Their ambience is modern, open and spacious, with a lot of natural lighting fom their wrap around floor-to-ceiling windows.Their lunch price point is very reasonable at $42++, if we choose a main dish like fish and chips. Their standard of food is great, and never wavers.The highlight is really their fresh appetizer semi-buffet with an excellent spread of bread, antipasti, salad, pasta dishes, cured meats, cheese and even fresh prawns with cocktail sauce. This can actually be the delicious main meal on its own.They accord friendly and efficient service.They are extremely popular during lunch, so reservations are highly recommended please.HelenSingapor

Level33 is beautifully located with views overlooking the Singapore skyline. I booked in advance for Sunday roast but I don't think that was necessary as the restaurant was not very busy (although most of the tables had a reserved sign on them). We had the lamb and chicken for mains with sides of the truffle cauliflower and carrot/swede.everything was excellent from a quality and taste point of view while the portions were very generous. We preferred the lager which was also very pleasant. This is a high end restaurant so we were not surprised at the bill and I feel the price reflected the quality of the food and the premium location. The service was attentive and polite but not very friendly or welcoming. Overall it's a good choice for Sunday roast and the views of the marina are amazing
5
Highly recommended to dinner and evening chill-outs. Good food and drinks with beautiful evening/night views!
4
Beer and food is very nice. There are many choice of beers. If you can sit outdoori you will see very nice view of marina bay.
4
Brought friends from overseas here as the view from here is awesome. They have a microbrewery and the beers are not too bad. However, do note that Chope booking only applies to indoors/dining area.
5
Great view, great service, nice ambience, friendly staff. Food portion was small though. A little pricy. Overall still a great experience.
5
Food is always outstanding and customer service is excellent. And the view ..... fabulous. It's always a pleasure to experience.
4
The view of Singapore was amazing! Great service, pretty good beer, average food. The buffet was not worth the price for one person.
3
We went there for a lunch and we are not allow to sit outdoor. I don't know why and I didn't ask as well. We ordered for the smoked white chocolate dessert which contained matcha sponge cake, the sponge cake is tasteless, did not have matcha taste
1
The serving staff is among the worst in my trip. Which includes Singapore and a big chunch of Indonesia. The view is spectacular though. We were around 12 people that decided to meet up. And they made a mess of orders/payments/losing cards and being arrogant. Go anyway but the 1/5 stars is for the management which hopefully improves service for the sake of future guests. Expensive but that is expected for that kind of view
4
Visited with friends who live in Singapore to enjoy a couple of drinks overlooking Marina Bay.The view is incredible and would be the main reason I would recommend it. Singapore looked amazing lit up at night. I would have loved to have gone back in the day and seen it.We enjoyed a round of drinks and some snacks - sizzling prawns and sizzling beef. Both were delicious but overall it was very expensive for what it was. Â£80 for 4 drinks and two small plates!! That would pay for a really good meal and a couple drinks for two people in London. Little tip - champagne is pretty much the same price as wine in Singapore so fill your boots!They do have a brewery here which is pretty cool, considering it's up on the 33rd floor. I actually think it might be the highest brewery in the world. So if you're into your beer it's probably worth going.Our friends said that the Sunday roast is really good too - which as Brits in Singapore is important to know! I think if you're on holiday and want a good view where you don't mind splashing the cash it's definitely a good place to visit
4
I love bringing friends and familys to level 33 to have a pint of their self-brewed beer and enjoy the spectacular panorama view of the marina bay sands. The balcony is always full , but sometimes the waiter or waitress could help to get a table at the balcony while you wait indoor. The balcony is the best photo taking spot for sure
4
good restaurant good found but im not lucky because it was rain, so me n my friends can not took picture clearly
3
overall not bad, we go that day is raining day, outdoor wet and section closed, staff not allowed to go out, can't take photo. :( some food is come with beer bubble, its special and can try.
4
The place is amazing. The view also. The service is very good. There are also exclusive wines and beer. However the food is not as good as expected.
5
Spectacular view, great food and amazing service. Kudos to the service staffs for making it a really special night.

Went here for a birthday dinner recently, and was actually very disappointed with the experience. The view is beautiful, overlooking the entire marina bay. As a microbrewery, they also had a wide selection of interesting beers. I had a beer mojito which was very tasty and nice. The beer tasting platter and the wine selection is also very good. However, we were VERY disappointed with the food. While the menu sounds interesting, the execution was very poor. Can't remember exact prices but the scallops and octopus appetizers were around $28, and both disappointed in their own way. For the price, you would expect a reasonable number of scallops, however the dish comes with a mere TWO scallops! While they were very well cooked, the portion size was a joke for the price. The octopus was a similarly small portion, and also quite chewy / lacking in flavour. Also ordered the heirloom tomato side as a veggie appetiser and was again, sorely disappointed. The ricotta terrine and the description made it sound very interesting but the "terrine" was more like a dense cheese soufflÃ© / quiche, and the tomatoes were just a few different types but all raw. So disappointing for the price and for a restaurant. Also ordered the brocollini and while it was quite decent, there was nothing to rave about. Mains: Got the cod and the iberico. The cod was very nicely cooked, but still not superb. Compared to Ramsay in MBS which has a similar pricing point, this was quite mid-range. The iberico was again very well cooked, but the "caramelised fennel" were basically raw, and the kai lan was 3 pieces of kai lan leaf. It says crust on the descipriton but you just get a few pieces of jamon scattered over, and the taste just wasn't hitting it for me. Also tried the vegetarian gnocchi, which is fairness was actually quite nice. Well made and fluffy gnocchi, tasty sauce, got bit of truffle on top. But it was just falling flat a little, somehow the sauce wasn't amazing and nothing tasted insanely good. At the end we got just one dessert, the beehive. This was really the worst dessert I've ever had, I'm sorry to say. The lavender mousse was disgusting. And there was way less of a chocolate element than indicated on the menu. A few friends also tried the bar bites and said it was not bad but not great, quite average. The drinks & view are great here, but I recommend giving the food a miss tbh. Especially with such high prices, the mediocrity is really appalling. PS: The bread is DELICIOUS however
2
Went there with the family before the headed back home after X-mas. Let's start with the positives. The service was great, the view excellent and the beer was brewed well if you like European styles. (Don't look for American style IPA's here)The food is what really lets this place down. First, the menu just tries too hard to be obscure. If you are going to do that you better do it well. They do not. The cold cuts came with 4 stale crackers. The onion soup was bland. The chicken breast was a joke...tiny and tasteless for +$30. The tenderloin beef and the cod were good but they are tough to screw up. The pork loin and lamb were dry, dry and dry. There was no wow factor whatsoever except for the view. Go there for a drink and the sunset.
5
I was very impressed both by the food quality and by the view of Singapore spectacular buildings. Try the fish and chips, you are in for a surprise when you see the plate. Not the common fish and chips you have in a small restaurant. Very funny but delicious
4
The title says it all; definitely a photo opportunity spot. The tables at the balcony were placed rather tightly along the edge yet lovely breeze in the evening may compensate for people squeezing in between to take pictures. We sat inside near the bar and had dessert and beer flight tasting. The pumpkin ale was a nice touch for the holiday season
5
Great place to take photo over the scenic Marina Bay! Night photo is much better than day photo eapecially with laser show at 8pm.We booked the open balcony for private function & had the whole section to our groups. The finger food are good. Nice place to have drinks & catch up with friends & colleagues
5
I pre-booked a balcony table during a recent holiday to Singapore at Level 33. To do this there was a minimum table spend in accordance with being the "F1 Weekend" but we were happy with this as we knew our spend would be greater.On our arrival in Singapore this was our first stop and it was a great experience, Level 33 is a brewery located within Marina Bay Financial Center - easily located by taking the Downtown Subway stop.Our table waiter had some good banter, what a lad, unfortunately I can't remember his name but he was taking pictures for us (cheeky) and made sure we all had plenty drinks.Myself and my cousins partner were smashing through the Beer paddles which allowed us to sample each of Level 33's beer choices, 3/5 were excellent the darkest one was ok and one of them was terrible ( I think that was the wheat beer). So we had more of the good stuff the IPA.The food choices were more of a share type and not really main meals but that suited us well as we were more out for a drink or 5. We ordered steak, tacos some fishy stuff and some olives and chorizo. The steak was absolutely smashing highly recommended................and the views - unreal, overlooking the harbour we got to see the sunset and the F1 lights come on and the city really come to life.Overall really worth visitin
5
Like the food, the ambience is lovely.
Can be a tad noisy come cocktail time but overall a good experience.
4
Visited for a business dinner. Location has an amazing terrace looking over Singapore and the harbour area. Best view you will get from anywhere. Restauant serves good food and wide range of beers. Inside or outside alfresco eating. Worth a visit.
3
the food look nice, the staff is friendly but the taste can be improved. it looks so tasty but when i bite into the meat, it's too dry you don't get juicy feeling
5
This is my first time at Level 33 since they revamped the menu.
The food was outstanding, the view was amazing. The price I paid for the whole experience was worth every penny
5
This restaurant is definitely worth a visit! The views are great and the service outstanding! And if you like steak you won't be disappointed!
4
Go and have a drink here for the view, as good as many others without the price tag. Good for craft beer too. Food is pretty basic but not bad all the same
3
When it comes to view and a nice beer, there will be only a few places in Singapore which can beat Level 33.But when it comes to food, one may say that food does not meet expectations.If you are looking for a full fledge dinner, you might be disappointed
5
Went here after recommendations from a friend. They hadn't been but was told it was great. They were right.It was a little bit of a search to find it considering it's on the 33rd floor.It gets pretty busy but we were lucky enough to get a seat at the bar.My husband got the beer tasting paddle and the bar staff were so helpful explaining the different types. I tried two of their specialty cocktails. They were both great.What we thought was going to be a quick drink we ended staying and getting the 5 little pigs meat platter. That was so yum. All of the food was great.The view is amazing. Great view of the marina bay sands and city. I think it was better than being on top of the marina bay sands. It mainly expats and tourists coming here to have a drink after work. It wasn't hard to hear another Aussie talking.If you are in Singapore this is a great place for a drink. Staff are great and easy to have a chat with. Great seats on the balcony if you can get one but our bar seats inside were good too. Highly recommended
4
Had a business lunch here and the starter buffet was very well assorted adn tasteful across the board. Also the maincourse was presented nicely and the taste was great. Service though was somewhat poor that day ( have been here several times before for lunch and didn`t have the same experience there) as obviously our main course order was not passed on to the kitchen in the first place and the waiters where in general not as attentive as I would expect from such a place.
5
Located in the Marina Bay Financial Centre this is a micro brewery and restaurant facing one of the world's most spectacular views of Singapore bay. The beers are great - check out their tasting option to try 4 different types in a smaller serve. To check the restaurant you will need to book ahead as it is popular. We were lucky to have drinks on the terrace before dinner and avoided a massive storm that turned to sky grey. In the restaurant we feasted on amazing steaks and a sumptuous dessert tasting plate (plenty for 2). This is the best view of MBS and a must do in Singapore. Pricey drinks but worth every penny
3
The best views of Singapore and tasty and reasonably priced beer ( for Singapore). The service was good. We found the food we ordered to be over salted and over priced for what we got on the plate. Probably won't return to eat.
4
This venue took some finding, however the search was worth it. Awesome views of the bay. Get there early for a good spot.
3
Food was so so but of a different style.., beautiful atmosphere, were making a reservation for a drink and nice breathtaking view outside the restaurant
5
Came by and sat at the bar to grab a drink and bite post marathon. Was served by Aldo who is honestly one of the best and coolest bartenders I've come across in Asia. He recommended some beers, and had time for a some amusing chat.Beers were nice, food was average. The wheatbeer was great. The bao tastes funky, and not in a good way. Bone marrow toast is great though.Will be back, not just for the views, but to say hello to Aldo too
3
We had the set lunch and whilst the quality of food was good, the restaurant could have done more to include at least a coffee. Service was good except for one particular staff who decided that she would take away our plates anytime she liked (even when we had not finished) and also did not ask us if it was OK to remove our plates
5
Food was good but don't expect Michelin standards. Its a little bit pricey but its totally worth it when combined with the fantastic view. Staffs were genuinely friendly and helpful with excellent service throughout. Its definitely a good place for chill out and can be a romantic place for special events. Overall a good dining experience at Level 33.
3
First of all, the staff are excellent - from the meet and greet right through to the table service it's really faultless, we were really impressed by the attention to detail in this respect...but the food is frankly too pretentious for it's own good. One of the starters (carpaccio) would have been delicious but was overwhelmed by mustard and some sort of "air" (horseradish?). The main courses were minimal to the maximum...tiny rounds of meat with smears of something and scattering of beetroot dust? The food is amazing quality and I get the chefs imagination but it still needs to be substantial enough to warrant the price and tasty enough to inspire a second visit.I'd highly recommend going for drinks and bar snacks - the view is incomparable, the staff are so professional and the drinks are great..And it may suit others well who like this kind of nouvelle cuisine but for me it was simply too much style over substance
3
Went for a weekday 2-course Gourmet Lunch Set with a colleague and ordered an additional beer sample (consisting of 5 different brew). Bill came up to about S$165.The main course Pork Iberico was fine but the tarte tatin (dessert) was not too nice n was quite hard and the lavender ice cream was slightly melted when served. The beer sampler was the first to be served and by the time we tucked half way into our food it was no longer chilled enough.Service was alright with an awesome view outside of the entire Marina Bay
3
Bringing a friend from Houston for dinner at this place. The place is posh and crowded when we were there about 7.30pm. The food portion is rather small and expensive. Taste wise, I would say average for the price we paid. For 3 person, we paid about $350+!! Ouch for the pocket! If you would like to sit outside for the view, additional charges applies. If you want something nice to eat and also comes with a spectacular view, my opinion is there are a lot more places with reasonable price
3
i have always enjoyed the food at level 33 especially the buffet starter which as always delivered and a great spread and the mains offered are usually well cooked and presented in a contemporary fashion. its a great venue for a business lunch or to bring friends its such a shame that the food and the view is not supported by pleasant and efficient service. if you walk into any venue and are met with a negative experience be it attitude or attention it will ruin your visit. I begrudge my venue choice being spoiled by factors that can be avoide
2
View from the deck is impressive, beer was good, service was fine, Food was disappointing, my steak was chewy and not the quality that I was expecting. The wine was very expensive and unexceptional.
5
Nice foods and view, service are good staffs are friendly, really enjoy our brunch and will bring more friends there.
5
Great evening experience...the starter platters, mains and brews...attentive service...excellent view @ level 33.
5
This venue has an outside bar popular for the business people in neighbouring office towers. It has on site boutique beer brewing for the beer connoiseur. The relaxed dining atmosphere inside belies the quality of the food. Aldo, our drinks waiter was amazing. Our food waiter was utterly disinterested, but maybe it was his off night. This is a good value venue...but book
1
Took international guests here to show them the sights of Singapore. Sat there for 15 minutes and no one came near us. So we left. Advised this to the manager who waved us goodbye. It's a tourist trap. There are places with better views in Singapore with much better customer focus! Go at your own peril
5
On the 33.floor of the standard chartered bank building this place offers an amazing view of the Marina Bay. Although it is a microbrewery it offers a very limited number of craft beers, I tried pumpkin beer and it was ok. IPA was good but I would definitely prefer a wider selection of beer at this plac
4
We arrived 10 minutes before the MBA lights show (19:50). The view from the restaurant balcony was marvelous. We also got a table with marina view which was very beautiful. The atmosphere is very modern and stylish. The dishes were quite good. Very small but well decorated and mostly tasty. But, the service was terrible. We waited for 45 minutes between first course to main course. Too much. Go Level 33 for the view and be patient with the food
5
Had a chance to try level 33 while visiting sinapore. The views especially at night are amazing on their own. If you like a good selection of crafted beers then they have that at a price which increases after 8pm. The porter which I chose was very good. The service was ok
3
 Visited with a group of friends and we all had the executive set lunch. Nice buffet of starters to chose from then about six options of main course. Beer is great and view fantastic. Service was attentive and they brought us a cake as they thought we were celebrating a birthday- it was a leaving lunch
4
Visited LeVeL 33 for dinner and drinks with my husband.The beers were very nice - enjoyed one of the tasting paddles and the beers that were recommended on the menu went perfectly with the food.We both had the wagyu steak and it was one of the best (if not the best) steaks we have eaten.Only thing that let down the experience (and me not giving this review 5 stars) was the service.When we arrived (at 6.30pm) the restaurant wasn't very full and we got great service. By 7:30 the restaurant had filled up quite a bit and it became evident that there wasn't enough staff on. The wait to order more food or drinks took quite some time (even after getting waiters attention) so in the end we decided to get the bill and leave.I gave my credit card over and it took a further 15minutes to get the payment processed. I wasn't very happy with the fact that my card was sitting on a desk for 15mins waiting to be processed.Overall though it was an enjoyable meal with amazing beautiful views of Singapore & the Marina Bay complex, just a shame the service towards the end wasn't as great as the food & view

Was there for a Sunday brunch with friends,foods took a while to arrive but was good. Service could certainly be better though
4
The view on Marina Bay is wonderful at night. The copper vessels in the dining hall turns it into a special ambiance. Menu caters international visitors. I couldn't find anything special. The micro-brew is good but overpriced. You pay for the view.
5
Just wow!  Take the direct elevator up.  Sunday they run a great brunch.
Views from this place are unbeatable.  Good crowd and unique beer brewed on site. 
Note to self:  Try the peppered  chocolate fondant....looks awesome!
5
Wonderful views of the area from level 33. Plenty of drinks to chose from and eats also.
Very efficient service.
Well worth a visit.
4
this is a perfect place for a drink in a quiet place.
you can enjoy light diner al fresco
they produce their own beer
5
Great city views and nice loungey feel with dim lighting. Food great too with selection of Italian and pub style. Would go back.
5
Great place for great local brews and amazing views. Wonderful time taking in the sites, chatting about life and unwinding!
4
We visit Level 33 all the time. It's a great alternate place to see the view of Singapore. They brew their own beer and it's pretty good. It's difficult to get a table on the outside area so try and book in advance. Also if it rains, they make you go inside. Bar food is good but small portions and a little pricey. The wings and bread with dips is prolly the best value for money. The Lunch Sets are good value for money on weekdays and the Saturday or Sunday brunches are good too.
4
The experience was excellent , the views were superb and the food and the beer were great . My only negative comment being that it was more expensive than I would have hoped for the meal and drink options - that said I would recommend going and have no regrets.You must book this meal and google the location as you won't find it by chance. It is on level 33 (no surprise there) in tower 1 in the financial district - top of marina looking north . Easy walk from most central locations. Good service and helpful staf
4
The ambiance is relaxed and a little dressy. The food is good and the selection of different beers impressive. If you can get a table outside I suggest you do so. The view is spectacular and will give you a backdrop for a great memento of your visit. It's definitely a good place to go to when you meet up with friends.
5
The view justified the visit. Ordered steaks, tender and juicy. Service staff friendly and customer oriented. Smooth beer from brewery. Slightly pricey but worth the visit. Will patronise again.
4
Perfect location with over-view of Marian bay sands.
Food was splendid. Service really good.
The beer concept with local brewery was soso. Beer just over-priced. Drinks good though.
5
My husband and I came here for drinks one evening. The view is outstanding and the staff are lovely.
4
Atmosphere is very cozy and relaxing.
Food portion is just nice and delicious.
Waitress has provided kind attitude.
4
Called in to Level 33 today after touring around the city. Enjoyed a beer tasting "paddle" which gives you the opportunity to sample 5 of their beers. Nice views over Singapore city and parts of the F1 racetrack.
3
Come for the view, panorama vista is really nice. Stay for the food and atmosphere... But forget the beer; tastes like water.
4
Honestly, i haven't explored much of singapore and i am pretty cool about it. Until i visited this place with my friends, oh boy, what have i been missing!!Located right next to marina bay sands, this bar is on 33rd floor of a skyscraper. Looking down at the shoppes and garden by the bay, u can literally have a bird's eye view of the beautiful garden (especially so if u got the right seat) ambience of the dining area is pretty romantic if u wanna impress your date or bring your partner to some place nice.Prices are pretty reasonable for the snacks and drinks. As my visit is not for dinner, i am not able to give much comments on that.Beer was great (i suppose beer is great anywhere) and the snacks was pretty awesome! We ordered sizzler beef and fat chips. Chips maybe so-so, should have tried something else, but the beef was really awesome! It was really tender and tasty, seasoning was just enough and not overpowering the natural flavor of the beef. For $18+ i kinda expected a slightly larger portion though, but hey, sometimes it's the quality that matters right?I will return to this restaurant again for dinner and maybe hang out for some drinks after that?
4
We used Level33 for celebration that my family came to Singapore and live together. My wife heard from her friend good reputation of Level33 then she strongly requested me to arrange this dinner. Wonderful night view and quite comfortable time were provided by professionals. My family was satisfied with this dinner,thanks.
5
During my visit to Sinapore my daughter and I went for lunch in LeVel 33. The lunch menu was a bit limited but I had lamb cutlets which were delicious. My daughter had an open burger which came with chips the size of small potatoes! Complementary bread was served and fresh water.Good service but quite expensive.Amazing views from the outside terrace but if a table outside is requested there is a waiting list!!!
3
I've been to this restaurant before, simply for drinks and the view. The second time around I brought my friends from Canada to the restaurant to take in the city-view from the top. Too bad there's a waiting list that you had to be on and the 2-hours we were there, we weren't even able to make the reservation for outside, despite completing our meal and drink our time there. The food was okay considering the price, and the original brew was okay too. Their pink cocktail was however, extremely delicious
5
Showboating an extraordinary panoramic scene of the city is unequivocally reason enough to pay a visit.
Coupled with a tantalising selection of lager and ales makes it even more worthwhile!
5
After a disappointing dinner the night before, we were very pleased with Level 33. We had a hard time finding the restaurant, but once we located it all was well. Entree's and beverages were excellent, staff efficient, and view/atmosphere pleasant.
4
Well this place has the best view so far. Staffs were great and the craft beer was good. Would love to go back again in future. Keep up the good wrk guys 👍🏼
3
Good vibe and amazing view, good food and plain beer. A little too pricey even considering all those good stuffs.
2
Price has increased without warning. I should have checked Tripadvisor comments before going there again. And more disappointingly is they removed the dessert buffet which used to have cakes and chocolate. Now it is fruit and cheese which is also part of the starter. So price has increased but value decreased = genius business acumen. Ala carte main is still not great: we tried the hamburger and fish and it was very disappointing. Not worth i
5
We had a great time here - we visited in the late afternoon to enjoy a view over Marina Bay on our last evening in Singapore. The views are special, and the beer is really good too (we really liked their special beer brewed for Oktoberfest). The staff were very efficient and friendly. Initially a bit difficult to find, but it's well worth the trouble!
4
Book early for a window table and arrive before sunset. Great view of Singapore's new Marina Bay area. See it before dusk, catch the sunset colours as you sip on wine or enjoy the micro-brewery's concoctions. Then savour the twinkling night scene after dinner. Prices on the high side .... as you'd expect for this upmarket joint
3
Amazing view from this terrace, one of the best in Singapore and unlike Maria bay you less likely to be squeezed by hundreds of other people. It's lovely to hang out on the terrace with friends and chat away. There's usually a nice cooling breeze here, which is a good thing in Singapore.They make their own beer here and they are very good. Cocktails are also good. Two criticisms, the music is terrible. They always seem to play some arty, Nouveau depression inducing, highbrow rubbish.My second issue is with the staff, service is okay, not fast but okay. My issue is their attitude, everyone seems totally depressed and fed up. I've been here several times and no one ever seems to pop a smile or be genuinely pleasent to the customers, bar staff are just so grumpy. This is such a pity as I love the view
4
This is another place that offers a good night view facing marina bay sands other than 1 altitude which offers 360 view. My second time here bringing overseas guest. Level 33 didnt dissappoint as well with the view right closer to you. We have a seat at the lounge area and ordered bar snacks beer platter. In order to have a table outside to enjoy the view it is advisable to book in advance as the place is always full of people during night time.
5
I've been to L33 many times and most of the time to drink and enjoy the view. This time, it was to dine and brought along some folks from the office for a business dinner.Overall experience was great! We got there around 630pm and got to enjoy the view with natural light. We went out for a 2nd time to see the night view and the light show at MBS at 8pm.Dinner was fantastic, we ordered the ribeye and argentine tenderloin. Both were good meat. The tenderloin was supposed to be rare but came out more like medium-rare. It was still good. Had a chance to try the kangaroo meat and it had a gamey taste different from deer. If you haven''t tried one, you can here.The cod was a good alternative to meat and had great sidings on the plate. The gambas were huge, I imagined the small prawns but this was 2 giant prawns and the sauce was very tasty.Net, this place isn't just about the beer and the view
5
Fist visit with friends in singapore.Good place and nice city view.Drink and food fantastics.We're really enjoy.
4
Dinner with friends, portion sizes a little inconsistent but generally ok, good selection of draft beers and a great view, particularly at dusk.
4
Had the executive lunch (steak) which was good. View was spectacular since that was probably the reason for most people. Service was only so so though.
4
We went to Level 33 to meet so long time friends who live in Singapore. They recommended this restaurant and it was an excellent choice. The service was awesome- our waiter and staff were very attentive, always made sure we were 'refuelled'. Food was very good with a great selection. The location was awesome to enjoy the view and then very close to enjoy a walk along the water fron
5
My partner and I visit Level 3 regularly mainly for Saturday brunch. The food quality, staff friendliness and efficiency is always exemplary. And I will definitely be back time and again.The only reason for me 'Poor' score on Atmosphere - was due to an extremely rude, aggressive customer. His wife was initially unhappy with the table they had been given, then after other people were seated at the table they had wanted - the gentleman had a very loud, aggressive outburst aimed at one more than one of you employees. Claiming that he always had bad experiences when attending your facility, and that he knew the manager (but strangely did not know his/her name).The staff handled it as well as can be expected, but I do not believe that they should have to put up with that kind of behavior and think that they abusive guest should have been asked to leave.Thank you again for an excellent eating and drinking environment. Just a pity that other guests have to ruin everyone's day
2
When you have a view over the Marina Bay like Level 33 owns it, then you're not forced to stretch - people will come anyway. As provocative as this statement is, as much I felt like that when I went there today to test the place for a series of dinner events that I was planning with my business friends and company. Unfortunately that won't happen as the staff couldn't have dealt with me in a worse manner. Asking for a table for just myself, I was put on a waiting list. I gave my cell phone number and was never contacted again. Meanwhile I've spent 45 minutes in an table-less area, watching one party after the other joining me there and joining me on the waiting list. Each one of those parties of 2 to 6 were invited to get their table until I was the only one standing. When walking over to the seating area, there seemed to be tables available. Hmm.I left the place to dine somewhere else where the view wasn't all that great but, where service was something they were proud of. Needless to say, guys, I won't select you for further events
4
If you are looking for a nice grilled steak and hand crafted beer that won't completely trash your budget in Singapore then come enjoy LeVel 33. I had a grilled steak and my vegetarian friend had pumpkin risotto. A truly amazing view of the marina tops off this place
3
Starter - selection of cold cuts was nothing speacial but we were very hungry and it was over in few minutesTbone - maybe one of the best I have ever eatenBeers - really tasty!Service - really kind and professional, sometime not enough quick but I have to say that the restaurant was full.Dessert - acceptableLocation - top!If the starter and dessert were at same level of the rest this could be really an outstanding restaurant. Like that it s a medium restaurant with some very good note
4
Food and beer recommended by the waitress are of good taste except the sirloin steak has bit more of fat for those who dont take much fat. Waiter and Waitress service are excellent. Just the seating arrangements is too near between each table that cause a bit of discomfort.
4
We went during lunch hour and there is moderate crowd, better to book in advance. We took the executive lunch set which came with the appetiser buffet. I would say it's pretty value for $. They have their own brewery but it was too early to drink. Will be back again in the evening
5
The steak is ver very nice and most value to the price. Plenty of choices of beer which is outstanding
4
Food and beer were special. There was a specific lift for this restaurant. We had dinner inside and the service was nice. After that, we went to the terrace and enjoyed the drinks and amazing view.
5
Come early to have a great view of the skyline. Both the food and their craft beer were great too....
5
We were lucky enough to have dedicated space on the terrace and enjoyed the outdoor environment and amazing view. Food, Beers and service were all very good.
5
Awesome food and good view. I would not hesitate to recommend to others be it for business lunch or special occasions.
4
The scenery is excellent especially during the night time where you can see the beautiful view of marina bay sand. The starter looks good but taste average. Main course taste good but the dessert cannot make it.
5
Very nice location and interior, food extremely good and abundant but a little expensive! Suggested for occasions
4
Went with friends and family on Sunday and had a great experience. Lovely food, great service and best of all, amazing view. Different perspective of the whole Marina Bay area. We booked a 6pm table, which was perfect as it allowed us to take some pics in the daylight, watch the sunset whilst looking at the menu and then return back outside after our meal to see the surroundings come to life at night. The ONLY slight disappointment was the beer - I had been looking forward to sampling the various options as they have their own brews....but found them all to be lacking something and all a bit samey. That's being very picky though and it didn't really effect what was a lovely evening
5
I have been living in Singapore for almost a year now and my family have come to visit me. I thought of where to take them on their first night and came up with LeVeL 33. I had been previously for drinks and loved the view, so I thought it would suit. We had a table reserved for us on the outside veranda which had the perfect view that I was looking for. The reservation was for 8pm and we got there just in time for the light show off of Marina Bay. The food was fantastic and nicely refined. We started with homemade tomato bread with various oils and butter and a seafood platter to share. We're all from a small seaside town in Kent where it is famous for its seafood, so this was right up our street. The waiter was extremely accommodating and friendly. Giving recommendations and making conversation with us and asking how long my family would be in Singapore for. When the mains arrived they were resented in such a way that you didn't want to spoil the effort that had been taken to piece it all together, but as soon as you started eating there is no way you could stop. The tastes were excellent. I had the shredded lamb gnocchi, which was delicious and my mother had the king prawns. I have definitely never seen prawns so large in my entire life! The waiter then brought us a sample of the bar food which was the lamb lollipops and they would just melt in your mouth. After our mains, he then brought us a sample platter of the deserts, all presented beautifully and on the side of the plate in chocolate writing it said "Welcome to SG"! This was the icing on the cake! The food was very reasonably priced, considering the location. The wine was expensive, but what would you expect from SG. Overall, a very memorable and fantastic start to their holiday and I will definitely be returning back in the very near future
5
The food is delicious, everything has a twist of ale/beer. My husband and grandparents had a soup that was like French onion with beer froth on top and a clear hint of ale in taste. It was yummy! I had the lamb gnocchi which was utterly delicious. They have an extensive wine menu, and lots of beers too. The views outside are beautiful. Only downside was it was pretty chilly so take a cardigan! I'll be back!
4
Very conveniently located, good appetizers, spacious and great view! Worth a visit. Great for a gathering on Friday.
4
Came back a year later for the same semi buffet lunch. Much better than the last time, steak I ordered was juicy and tender and the appetiser buffet spread was much better with a good selection of salad, cold meats and cheese
5
A must do in Singapore. If you go with your couple, friends or family, you need to go to this place for a beer. The best view of Singapore with excellent crafted beer.
Try the 5 samples of beer.
5
The restaurant has an amazing view which is what one primarily goes for. But the food is great and the service very professional. It's my favourite place for lunch in Singapore!
4
The view is awesome. The drink zone is outside with slant seats that makes you fall off. I know it is for half standing/sitting position but it can be better.
5
A stunning venue for a dinner and or drinks. Coincide your visit to watch the laser show from the MBS.
A great experience!! Dont forget to order a cocktail!
3
I visited with my friend. Great views and great dinning but the selection of food and counter services are poor. I ask to cut for us the fruits but they didn't remove the skin and there is no fruit spoon when we eat the kiwi. Best price for lunch at this place with the view. Just wish the service and food could be better.
2
Caught up with a friend for Sunday lunch. Positives: The ViewNegatives: The poor service and attitude of the wait staff (apart from Aldo who was good) We ordered a bottle of wine the food came first (after 20 minutes). The condiments we ordered took another 5 minutes, therefore we were wineless and without condiments looking at our food getting cold. We had tell the wait staff to hurry up so our food didn't get cold. There was no sense of urgency. The beer came under poured (there's event a pint marker on the side of the glass and they still couldn't hit that)I have the roast lamb leg. Big bone not much meat. The potatoes were par-cooked. The roast beef that my friend had was a better bet.In summary, not worth going back, underwhelming typically poor Singaporean customer service (and yes I live here) trading on the view and that is all
5
Visited here on our last night in Singapore. So glad I decided on this venue. Food was fantastic (especially the legendary gnocchi), beers brewed on site were excellent and to top it all off the view was simply breathtaking. There may be higher open deck restaurants but none better than Level33 I can assure you of that
5
Firstly, the service was the best I have seen so far. They were very friendly and helpful! The recommendations they made was simply amazing! We really enjoyed the food and the wine they recommended! Special mention to Mr Anthony for the tasty wine selection! The view, the service and the food was stunning! It's a definitely must have experience at least once in your lifetime
3
Great view, good food and mediocre to bad service. For price and what I heard i was surprised at the experience.
5
The location is spectacular and the skyline view of Marina Bay is breath taking! The beer is well pair with the food.
4
Fantastic location - food cool to perfection - exactly what to expect , the blonde beer cloudy and nice. Rapid service well thought out restaurant - bread exceptional, Bill... Very good value will be back
4
Nice place for business and leisure dining. Offers fantastic view of the bay. Semi-buffet spread is generous and good.
5
This bar is described as the highest brewery in the world and it may well be. It serves it's own beer in the stunning setting looking out over downtown Singapore and the bay. The beer we tried was good with IPA ,wheat beer, stout, Pilsner all available. Prices were on par with smart bars in the city but the view was outstanding. May get busy at times but as we were mid to late afternoon there was no problem getting a table on the terrace.
4
Top tip if you want the view but not the pricetag. Well, not entirely because the drinks are not cheap, but in comparison with the bayfront neighbours, here you get the view with drinks instead of only the view. Count around 10 dollars for a Home Brew beer, the atmosfere is friendly, casual chic. Visit around 6 for a sundowner!
4
L33 is a good place to meet up and enjoy both the good choice of beer and the view over the marina. The food looks good but can't comment on taste as I've only had the beer :) Service can sometimes be a little slow but the staff are generally helpful and not too difficult to find.
4
Went to level 33 for a birthday lunch. We were told before arrival that in Singapore you need to let the service slide and this was no exception. The service has no initiative and we had to ask 3 times for a glass of water. The view is money maker here. It's simply Devine with panoramic views of Singapore. If you don't didn't go on the eye then this be pleasantly be the same view. The food was quite delicious. Very large portion sizes. We had the open burger which was very tasty. Only criticism is the large cut fries need to be feel fried a few more times as they were soggy. All in all a pleasant experience and would recommend
5
Spent a wonderful evening here with friends from work and had a really delicious dinner. I can recommend meat on the menu, but then again, I really like meat. My wife had kangaroo for dinner. It was delicious as well. If you get a chance, try and sit at a table towards the outside of the restaurant, the view of the waterfront is amazing. The menu is a-la-cart, so remember to order your side dishes. Yum
5
Level 33 has become our standard 'last night in Singapore' treat now, and having visited for the 4th time last night, the experience was just as enjoyable as the previous times.The food was cooked nicely, and the presentation is always spot on. We're always tempted to order more than 2 sides between four of us but you don't need them if you're planning for starters and desserts as well - the meals are deceptively filling. The blonde lager is pleasant and very drinkable.The prices are just hanging on at the top end of "affordable for a treat" and this is what keeps us going back
5
At Level33 you have the best view of the stunning Singapore CBD scenery. Paired with stunning home brewed beers, and delicious food. A must visit in Singapore!
3
I don't think there's any place in Singapore that can beat this view. Drinks were very good but pricey. The food however was underwhelming. I'd suggest going here for a couple of drinks but plan on eating elsewhere.
4
A restaurant with an amazing view of Marina Bay and the skyline of Singapore with great food and fantastic service.
4
We had a wonderful view over Marina Bay from the balcony, enjoying really excellent food and the selection of fine craft beers the restaurant offers.
A great place for special occasions!
4
We came here for Sunday roast and although they had run out of chicken and some vegetables the food was still very good. I had the beef which was very nicely cooked and I especially enjoyed the stuffing. My boyfriend also had the beer paddle which was a selection of the 5 beers they brew there which was very niceI would recommend coming earlier for lunch so they don't run out of food and I am sure you will have a great mea
5
The views from the Terrace (high rise seats) is just unparalleled as you are treated to a full panoramic view of the bay.Start with the freshly brewed "Beer Tasting Paddle" accompanied with the following from their "Beer Dining" options: The Tapas Trio, Pig and Sizzler Beef ... and save space for their chocolate dessert
4
One of my favorite watering holes when visiting Singapore - I always try to go in non peak hours to make sure I get a terrace table which means an unrestricted view of Singapore - one of the best in the country. This time I tried the 'Beer Taster' - a selection of the beers they brew in the worlds highest micro brewery. It was mid afternoon on a warm day and so I had to get through the beers quite quickly before they became too hot - loved some of them and all were very drinkable. The views of the bay were stunning as usual - a great afternoon with some 'Bevie Buddie' friends
3
The view can't be beat. You need to reserve a seat ahead if you want to sit outside. The Marina Bay Sands light show at 8:00 and 9:30pm are a great time to be there. Great selection of local brewed beer. Sunday buffet is way over priced with poor selection.
4
We were invited to Level 33 for National Day - fantastic view over the bay and the food could not be faulted - we did not try their beer but the wine selection was excellent - perhaps the service was a little slow but very understandable considering the occasion and in any case the friendly service more than made up for any minor hiccups - overall a great experience and we will be back at a less busy time to fully enjoy the atmosphere and vie
4
We went to level 33 on a Friday night for a special occasion. As there is a minimum spend of 60 dollars per person for a balcony ( outdoor) table, we decided to have dinner there. It was a good decision as the food was delicious and reasonable for an establishment like this in singapore. We had a beef tartare for starter (around 20 sgd), lamb leg to share - big portion (around 100 sgd) which comes with 3 small sides of spinach, mashed potatoes and sweet carrots. the food was definitely worth it as it was good quality , delicious and large. Cocktails , wine and beer are rip off. Had house savignon blanc. Was good but the glass was not filled to usual amount . Had daiquiri which was too sweet. End up having to follow up with cappuccino (7 sgd) which was a good choice . Overall, we will definitely go back for the view and the food!
5
Level 33 is a cool place with great homebrewed beer! a bar good for after work or just be be high above the city for great pictures. I have been there only for drinks but really enjoyed it.
4
We were recommended Level 33 for Sunday lunch by friends and were not disappointed. We initially ate inside and then asked to have desserts and coffee outside on the balcony from where the views are magnificent. The service was a little slow but we weren't in any hurry. I struggled to choose as there were a few things that sounded lovely but in the end I had the beef with Yorkshire pudding and vegetables which was delicious. Everyone else enjoyed their meal too and if you want Yorkshire pudding but don't want beef just ask and they'll oblige and charge about £2 extra but they are big Yorkshire puddings. The beer was an extra bonus for the guys! We got some great photographs and I'm only sorry that we didn't have the chance to go in the evening as well
5
This micro brewery/restaurant is perfect for a romantic dinner or with friends, the view over to Marina Bay Sands, the Fullerton and the river is perfect, aim for a dry/ clear night. Definitely book for an outdoor table on the balcony. I highly recommend the chocolate mousse dessert - its incrediable.One of my most favourite places in Singapore
4
Nice place overlooking the Marina Bay with a great view of the iconic Sands Marina Bay Hotel. They serve a pretty good selection of craft beers. Selection of food was good, although I personally did not like my lamb/rice dish - it tasted a little bland. I would return for the views, good beer and then a different dish ;
5
If you want a table on the balcony you must telephone, otherwise book online or turn up on spec and take a table inside. You can wander out to see the light show at 9.30pm..there is some standing space. We had the meat platter for 4 and there were 5 of us. Loads...! We had room only for starters after that, but there was a good choice of dishes. All fab. A very good evening
1
Attended a private lunch party here and had the three courses set lunch; very disappointed:1/ The starter steak-tartar was OK but the accompanied crackers were so hard they were unbreakable!2/ The main of Beef (medium rare) was just, um, far too tough, one needs a saw to cut it3/ The desert sorbet was too sour.Other than the fantastic view of the Singapore Harbour and the friendly service, this place is far over rated (and over priced)
5
Great location overlooking Marina Bay on the 33rd floor. Brewed beers are excellent. Great food too...Ideal place for business social gatherings... However only problem is reservations. Staff ask for reservations; however they never answer phone to place reservations. I tried atleast on 5 or 6 occasions but still no luck. Need a strong front desk responsible person or manager. ⭐⭐⭐
5
I took my gf there for the view and beer. We ordered t bone for 2 pax and it was unexpectedly delicious. The t bone was juicy and the sauces that came together were the best to go with steak. We ordered more beer to sit outside and the view was magnificent with the Sands and Flyer on my feet! Overall it was a great experience and I want to thank Aszri for his great service
4
This place was good. Location is pretty awesome. I can see all of view of singapore. Music was also generally satisfied but it was a little bit loud. It interrupts talking. It is better to be lowered. Foods were also yummy. Price was a bit expensive. And I should pay minimim expense but I didn't know. More detailed announcement was recommended.
5
Located on 33 floor of Marina Bay Financial Centre Tower 1. Walkable from Marina Bay Sands Hotel and shoppes. A little confusing to go from entrance of building to elevators servicing 33rd floor - around the side. Once past the confusion, everything clicks. Easy trip up elevator to 33rd floor - fabulous views. Nice bar and restaurant with both indoor seating and outside outdoor high tables forst. Prices are not inexpensive. Microbrewed beers are outstanding. Meat is food emphasis - I shared a t-bone for two and did not regret it one bit. Great sides, lots of sauces included in meal price. Would go again without question
4
The view is awesome and the food is excellent , staff polite and friendly . Price is not cheap but you get for what you pay ! Burn appetito !
4
Good Food especially the condiments. Had the T- bone steak which will very good. Just on its own without the sauce. The whole experience was enhanced by wonderful service staff.
5
The beef with wasabi is killer! The drinks and beer spread is superb.
Don't go here on a rainy day. Expect lots of wind.
They have a smoking section too... Which is perfect!
5
Great meal, amazing view, staff were on point with service. I highly recommend this restaurant and I suggest you request a table outside. We were originally inside, but as soon as table came available they kindly offered us to move.
5
Visited Level 33 for drinks whilst in Singapore. Unbelievably cool bar with amazing views and attentive staff. We had drinks in various locations during our visit and this place was one of our favourite!
5
While the famous roof tops around Bay are one altitude and ce la vi, this place isn't the most talked about but to me has the best view. The place has a look of a micro brewery and good selection of food and beverages. Their service is far better then the other 2 and you don't have to pay as much even if you decide to have dinner here. I am also biased since I work in the same building but go once and you will know what I am talking now about!
4
We came in late and they were kind enough to accomodate us and serve us dinner. The menu is peculiar and probably not for very hungry people (small portions), but it's well cooked and interesting. You get a very good choice of beers and all are very good, plus the view is incredible. Recommended

Try their speciality beer with an outstanding view of Singapore from the topdo reserve in advance .. time to time can be very packedand enjoy the dinner and try to reserve the table new the window and continue the night from terrace with outstanding view of singapore at nigh

Must visit when in Singapore. From the deck you have a great view of the bay area, CBD and Marina Bay Sands by night or day. The brew their own beer and it is nice to have the beer flight.You can only reserve for dinner inside; outside booking is hardly possible. Due to the view you have to stand outside, but it is worth it.Unfortunately the level of service does not match the ambiance of the place. You cannot eat outside. Or sit inside at a table and order just bar bites and drinks they are vocal about that. We have been told by 3 staff members we had to order before 21.30. We did not feel that customer comes first.On the plus side: spectacular view and high quality delicious food with local beer

I think this hits the sweet spot in terms of value for money and views of the singapore skyline. Has the worlds highest craft brewery which might sound a bit gimmicky but the beer is pretty good and if you get in before 8 its not even that expensive (~8-9 SGD). The view is staggeringly good, if you don't have a table, order a beer and head outside and enjoy the cold brew while you have the entire SP sklyline as a backdrop
5
Attendant was very attentive and even offered us a outdoor seat after dinner to enjoy the night cityscape.

Recommended scallop for starter, fresh and soft. We had brittany cod and corn fed poulet for our main and was impressed with the food especially the brittany cod.. love the night scenery
5
Ambiance 5 ⭐️'s, staff 5⭐️'s, food 5⭐️'s, price points expensive but worth it. A place for hanging out, dining with family and friends and great for dates.

We were lucky to be able to reserve a table for dinner on the same day (weekday) but had to be there at 6pm and vacant the table by 8pm. All turned out great as had the panoramic city review in daylight, sunset and night.The t-bone steak for 2 was wonderful, with 4 tasty sauces and great greens.By the time we finished our dinner, we were (by luck again) moved to a bar table in the terrace where we had more drinks
4
Good food recommendation by the service staff. Good service overall. Had dinner in the comfort of aircon dining area. Managed to get us an outside table for after dinner drink.Food which we took :Starter - zucchini dish (special n not on menu), pig n snail (yummy especially the crispy minced pork)Main - beef n reef, corn fed poulet, kangaroo (good recommendation by service staff to have kangaroo at medium rare so that it's not rubbery/tough). All 3 meats are nicely done n tender.As this restaurant brew their own beer, we had the beer tasting paddle which consist of 5 different brew each in 0.1l glass. Good way to try the different beer before deciding to go for a bigger mug of your Favourite choice.Their choco fondant is yummy with warm lava flowing when cut

Cold beer overlooking glorious Singapore followed by excellent food .... what a night. I am informed that the fresher beer is the better. Clearly this beer is SUPER FRESH. It is brewed in the restaurant. We were mid week and still the place was almost totally full. Often great views means mediocre food. These guys totally destroy that. My food was some of the best I have had anywhere in the world. I chose the venison which is very easy to over cook. My dish was rare and magnificent.

This bar is exceptionally cool, it has amazing views but unfortunately the clientele and the attention span of the waiters leaves somewhat to be desired. We did not have a booking but were politely told by the hostess if we just wanted drinks then the rooftop area was perfect. We were shown to a table, and it took around 15 mins for a waiter to even bother with us. Not a great start. After our drinks it took us 20 mins to pay. I ended up chasing the waiter through the restaurant. The waiters and waitresses also it seemed had favourites, not sure if because this is a place full of city workers that they tended to steer away from the tourists but at the end of the day were all paying customers.Overall a nice place but I would not rush back or recommend

Only the lady at the entrance was more polite. The serving staff were in need of more training and require a little more pride in their work. There were many, many points in my dining experience at which the serving staff had poor service. I just wish to raise one. I asked for bread and when the service staff came back a short 2 minutes later (I acknowledge that he is speedy on this aspect), he placed the bread on my friend's plate. To which my friend pointed out that I asked for the bread and without a blink of the eye, the service staff simply transferred the bread on my friend's plate onto mine. And then there were other examples where the staff were just bordering on rude. The service felt as if I was at Long John's Silvers or KFC, where the staff were part time students with basic training. It would be fine if it was not at a expensive restaurant like Level 33.The food was hit and miss. Avoid the roast pork. The fat was not rendered properly and we ended up chewing on rubbery fat.If you are just looking for a restaurant at high ground, there are at least three other places I can name that have better food and service. Skip this or try once

a friend just dragged us going here and we weren't disappointed!! we were quite full from the makansutra dining so we just capped our night with a bottle of white wine for $80.quite expensive considering $80 in my country could already buy about 6 bottles of hardy's/gossips and the likes :) but the experience and the oh so amazing view of Marina bay while sipping your glasses would make you order a few bottles more!!smoking area is available oat the far right side, not a problem for smokers. If we had the time i was looking into their beer tasting paddle. the time we visit, most of the crowd should i say not locals?. I would definitely come baaacckk
4
LeVeL33 has a rooftop bar with a brilliant view into the Marina and to the Marina Bay Sands. The own brewed beer is tasty but as expected for a place like this not cheap - you pay for the view with the drinks. It is a great place to see the sunset and take nice pictures.
5
After a long trip I had to wait for a friend to finish work. Sfaff was very welcoming , taking care of my luggage - just the beginning :-) Nothing tops the view paired with excellent food and drinks!
4
Tantalising food, heartwarming service, breathtaking view ! Recommended for group gathering and chilling !
5
The banjo lamb was incredible we shared it between two but it would easily feed 3-4 it was probably the softest sweetest lamb I have eaten in a very long time, the lager was pricey but good
3
Really loved the view from the rooftop bar. Service was not great but it is still worth a visit.... Drinks were great and snack menu was also very good
2
1) Salmon fillet had traces of small bones. Fish was overcooked and dry.
2) Waiter was sarcastic when we did not tip for his "okay" service
3) Waited a long time for water to be re-filled
4
Having lunch there on a weekday is quite a pampering experience. Highly recommend to go in early where one can enjoy the buffet before the crowd streams in.
2
I'm a regular at Level 33 at lunches for work but only for the location. However in more recent times my experience has gone downhill:- prices have gone up- slow service/meals. The set lunch menu is not long so I don't know why it takes so long to get served- food quality is pretty mediocre given the prices- service staff also are not as happy at allI can there are less people visiting at lunch as a result. I suggest going to other better value restaurants for lunch away from this area eg near Amoy Street and Gemmill Lane if you have sufficient time. Go for the view but not the food.
3
I have been a very regular visitor to arguable the best restaurant / microbrewery in Singapore. Fantastic views , great beer, good wine collection and a good food menu (very limited veg options in the menu ). I have also had business lunches almost once a week and I was a little stunned at today's experience. The buffet spread of starters continues to be good with a nice main course and lovely cheeses to end with. Shocked to find deserts completely taken off the table and only uncut fruits lying there - a deterrent in itself. I know prices have gone up but have never figured out how restaurants can be so petty. Charge a couple of dollars extra but provide a full spread - how many pieces of sweets am I going to eat? You are a fantastic place - pls do not resort to cutting corners.

This busy business lunch place doubles as high rise boutique beer brewery and bar venue on level 33 ( of course) of the BMFC tower which overlooks the Marina Bay Area. It has the option of eating outside, if you can live with the humidity. The stunning seafood plates and gourmet salads were great value, along with daily specials. The clientele included the rushed business lunch crowd and the Jean and designer tee shirt relaxed set, with time on their hands and money in the pocket. A fun place which is worth the return visit.

Great location. Quite the hidden gem. Need to know a local to find it!However, once on Level 33, it is an amazing view. Recommend trying to make a booking beforehand as it can be very busy and hard to get a seat.The service is very professional and friendly. The staff are all extremely helpful.The bar snacks are great, with a wide variety of food. Perhaps more Singaporean local food in the future would showcase Singapore's history and heritage.The beers are also made on the premises which adds to the great atmosphere.The only drawback is the prices so be prepared. The beers are around S$ 15. The bar snacks are also S$33 on average.But it is very well worth going up the 33 storeys to view the 8tonnes of metal for the brewery on site as well as the view from 156 metres above Singapore. Simply amazing views

We celebrated a 50th birthday here.
Food was delicious
Service was attentive
We would return for sure. This was our second visit
4
If you are looking at a place to see a great night view of singapore, level 33 is the best place. The beer is good too but it's quite pricey here.
4
This bar has one of the most spectacular views in Singapore so try to get a table outside. The food is good, but the beer is probably one of the best craft beer I've tried.
4
Had dinner Monday and absolutely loved it from starter to main to dessert. Nice combination of flavours and textures. Superbe presentation.
The view is absolutely amazing.
Definitively worth it.
Service was quite slow but may just have been unlucky.
Definitively a place to recommend.
5
This bar has spectacular views over the city. Understandably it is popular and difficult to get a seat/table outside. Beer was great but expensive. Would recommend purely for the views.

We were recently advised to go to Level 33 but I'll leave it off my list next time I visit Singapore. Upon eventually finding the place, we were advised that there were no tables available but we could sit at the bar or stand on the small portion of terrace that was available. It took almost 15 minutes before we were served and then when the drinks came each one was a short measure....Not what I expected when I pay over $80 for a couple of wines and beers. We then had to ask the waiter 3 times for the change which took a further 20 mins. Honestly there is more atmosphere on the moon and the beer was very average. Upon leaving, the staff couldn't even muster a thank you for visiting our over hyped and overpriced establishment. Awful customer service and experience
4
Came here for drinks on a Friday night.The place was pretty crowded, and something like 10 of us were crowded around a tiny little table while we waited for other tables to clear up.If possible, take the seats on the outside on a cool day or at night. The view is much better

Undeniably the worst dining experience in my life. LeVeL33 is pretentious and pricey, but does not even make an effort with its food or service to match. Go for the view – if they will give you a window-side table. Go for the beer – if overpriced booze Is your thing. But do not go for the food, no matter what. If you are smart, you will know that you can get whatever LeVeL33 claims to offer and more at many other places – places which actually care about your experience with them. I have NOTHING good to say about LeVeL33 after the experience I had. I made reservations to have dinner at LeVeL33 to celebrate my husband’s birthday. As I suffer from multiple food allergies, I made contact with the restaurant very early – more than a week ahead. I wanted to be sure they were prepared to cater to my dietary restrictions. Or let me know if they couldn’t so I could make alternate arrangements at a place that was able to handle diners with allergies; I did have other restaurants in mind that I was going to call if LeVeL33 was not up to it. My email correspondences with a senior guest relations officer were pleasant enough, and I requested to pre-order a salad starter and the corn-fed chicken main. Usually, this should go a long way in helping the kitchen prepare ahead and make the necessary concessions since it knows exactly what should be avoided and which dishes the customer wants to have. Subsequently, the guest relations officer called me to tell me that she had run through my dietary restrictions with the chef and yes, they can definitely work things out so I can dine at their restaurant. The salad had cheese which I hoped they would substitute with something else but I was informed they could only remove the cheese, not replace it. Okay, cool – although I can imagine a dozen different ingredients that can go in a salad – fruits, vegetables, whatever they had on hand that was fresh and naturally gluten and dairy-free. So I said, I’m fine with that but it should have been a warning sign because in my experience, such high-end places tend to go to extraordinary lengths to make sure patrons enjoy their meals, even if, and especially when, they are unable to delight in the standard fare off the menu. Plus, it was a very highly-priced salad. But I was too eager to give my husband a novel experience that I ignored my better instincts. So I made reservations to dine there on a Saturday evening. Unfortunately, they could not book a table by the window for us despite one of the diners being a birthday celebrant. That they couldn’t make adjustments for customers celebrating a special occasion was another warning sign which I stupidly chose to ignore – so confident was I that it was going to be a stellar experience regardless. Boy, was I wrong!  On the day of our dinner, I received a call in the morning from the restaurant and a staff member confirmed my reservations for the evening AND my pre-order – salad (no cheese, plain oil and vinegar dressing on the side) and the chicken (no sauce) with potatoes and vegetables. I really could not have been more clear if I tried. Plus I had given them a list of foods that I absolutely cannot have. So anyway, everything seemed settled. Until we arrived at the restaurant, were seated AND had already been served a glass of champagne each. The waitress who served us told us in a very blasé manner that sorry but I cannot have the chicken because it is already brined before cooking and contains soy (and gluten, obviously). Needless to say, I was very upset – I do not eat red meat and am allergic to several types of fish and shellfish but usually enjoy chicken. And someone from the restaurant called me that very same morning – couldn’t they have said something so I could have thought of a backup plan? Couldn’t the kitchen have set aside one un-brined chicken for me – I did confirm my reservation!? I was about to down the champagne to douse my anger and leave to eat someplace else but I am a rational human being and while I was extremely disappointed, I was not about to make a scene. So I decided on the cod which came with some nice-sounding sides but what do you know – I couldn’t have most of it because of the preparation method so they said they could give me two servings of plain blanched spinach and a couple of leaves of chargrilled kale. If that sounds sad, that’s because it really is. Downright depressing. I literally begged the waitress if maybe I could have some potatoes please? She said no, they could not do it such that it was safe for me to eat. I didn’t realise it was so hard to bake a jacket potato or roast a few baby potatoes in olive oil. Or heck, even grill two halves of a tomato? I’d expect a restaurant of such high standing to have ready stock of these simple ingredients, and also have a fair understanding of food allergies. It may be hard to comprehend unless you or a loved one suffer from food allergies but people like me do not eat out very often because there’s too much anxiety involved and we also have a deep fear of being seen as troublesome customers, so when we do manage to arrange a nice dinner outside of our home, we take great care to cover all our bases and fervently hope that the food will be at least decent, if not delicious. My food was quite frankly a disaster. I am allergic, not dead – everything was tasteless and the presentation was rubbish. I barely ate any of it and not one of the servers was concerned or cared to ask what’s wrong, not even when they cleared away a meal that had barely been touched. I remember when an anxious waiter in a small hotel restaurant had asked me twice if the oatmeal porridge wasn’t to my liking because I had left a few spoonfuls at the bottom of the bowl; it had been the most wonderful porridge I’d ever tasted but I really was quite happily full and couldn’t eat another mouthful even if I tried. NOT the case at LeVeL33. Even my husband’s steak was nothing to write home about and his meal was not modified in any way to cater to a food allergy. So even their regular dishes are below par. It was his birthday but he had to comfort me and promise me we can get out of there soon and go get something else. The table next to us was occupied with far fussier people (expats) who complained about an overcooked steak, a wrongly-done sauce and prices that were too high for such poor-quality food (we overheard everything); the manager spoke with them twice, but they sure as hell weren’t going to come back and will undoubtedly tell all their high-class friends not to either. The whole restaurant truly lacked care and pride. It was really quite sad, which is why we chose not to put any of the staff on the spot and just paid our $239 bucks (!!!) and left to go have something at Lau Pa Sat – so much more satisfying and for so little money. I am not a whiner, I know my diet is really restrictive so I am usually happy just to be able to have something to eat but the food that was served at LeVeL33 really took unsatisfactory to another level

Once your taxi driver finds the correct location the experience is worth it!Hidden in the Marina Bay Financial Centre Level 33 had a micro brewery and the most stunning views.We had booked for dinner which had a delightfully different menu. Commencing with a cocktail of French champagne , gold and beer which was a glorious pink rolling with gold we started the food offering. All very nice with quite a bit of Australian meat our meals were interesting and good. As it had been a stormy afternoon the outdoor area was closed but eventually opened in time to enjoy the unbelievable light show.Level 33 is an 'experience' but worth the visit. Not easy to find, firstly the building then the elevator to take you up to level 33 isn't easy but persevere. Wine is not inexpensive nor is the food but enjoyable for holiday special time. The view is exceptional!
5
When in Singapore we always go to Level 33 to take in the view over the whole Marina Bay area and the city and coast beyond. The venue is located way up an office building but, unlike some others, there is no charge to ride in the elevator. The staff were very welcoming and attentive and the food and drinks fully met expectations. There have been different beers most times I have visited and they are, incredibly, brewed right there in this micro brewery 33 storeys above the bustling streets of Singapore. Well worth a visit
4
It is a nice brewery with and inviting dinner menu. Nice atmosphere. Located at the top of a building. You can enjoy a breath taking view
5
A perfect restaurant and you may expect nice Singaoore view from the restaurant. Waitress and waiter are good with food knowledge, of course must try theirs beer , perfect beer !
5
Every dish was great, looks so good tastes much more than its look. The ingredients and the mix between all of them was something for remembering for long time.
4
The view is obviously the reason why you go to this restaurant. But food honestly could be better. Beers actually were very nice and I am not a beer fan.
3
I booked dinner here to celebrate my partner's birthday while we were in Singapore as he loves beer and the menu and view looked amazing. The evening started brilliantly with great service from Aldo and we were offered an outside table with great view prior to returning inside for dinner. Aldo recommended the blue beer cocktail which sounded weird but tasted amazing. Our entrees were delicious the scallops and "pig and snail", the latter being a rather large serve but we ate it all as it was tasty. Unfortunately our main courses were very disappointing. I ordered the gnocchi with slow cooked lamb shoulder which sounded amazing but the gnocchi was pan fried and chewy/tough and the sauce oily. I actually didn't eat it. My partner ordered the rib eye medium rare and it was salty and half of the steak cooked well done the other half perfectly medium rare. In future we would definitely go back for a drink and to enjoy the view but wouldn't recommend stay for dinner. I gave it a rating of 3 as drinks, view and initial service 5 but food I would rate main courses a 1, entrees as 4
4
We were recommended to visit Level 33 for the wonderful views of Marina Bay and the futuristic Gardens By The Bay. After a hectic morning and afternoon sightseeing around Singapore , we decided to refresh ourselves with some lovely fizz on the balconies of Level 33. As expected drinks are a pricey but the views and welcome breezes ( it's on the 33rd floor ) made it worthwhile . We did not dine here as there are many other better and cheaper eateries around. It was a trifle difficult to locate the correct elevator ( lift ) for Level 33. We had to enter two separate businesses ( on the ground floor ) to ask for directions to get to lift for Level 33 . Staff were most helpful on the ground floor and very courteous and friendly on Level 33. If you would like a quiet and peaceful ambience to savour the views , I would not advise you to go in the evenings from 7pm onwards as it gets very busy with professional workers who meet up here for drinks food and the bar atmosphere
1
It was my friend's birthday and we book a cake through phone call and ask them to write happy birthday on the cake. Just 30mins before arriving the restaurant call us and say they did not receive such booking and they dun even have a normal cake left. the birthday celebration was totally ruined because of this. Be careful when u book this bar
4
What I like is that it has a very good view of the surrounding area and the ambience. The staff there are also very polite and courteous, constantly checking if everything is to my liking. The food is not bad and the portion is decent. Pricewise, a main course is about 40 dollars and if you order plain water it is 8.50
2
It was my Friend birthday celebration however the food was served close to 1 hr via ordering and service attendant did not come and explain why till we asked. My Friend birthday cake s name was spelled wrongly after telling them on the phone for more than 6 times , suppose to be a surprise because of the wait we have to order additional dessert so we can tell our birthday girl that we are waiting for some more food to come. It will be my first and last time visiting level 33
2
I have been there several times and the views from the outdoor balcony are just perfect. Gab a drink and enjoy the view - even though it does get very crowded. However I highly recommend that you hightail it out of there and eat somewhere else. The food has deteriorated over the years and is really not worth half the money they charge.We were 20 people and no one enjoyed their meal.. The most you heard was it was "ok" whereas at least 1/3 of the plates were left with a lot on it. Just not worth it. Deserts are the only exception - really good.So enjoy the view and get out :-
3
I fixed my first lunch over my business trip at Level 33 where I went there quite often when I was working in Singapore.
It was a little bit disappointment to me as service as little slow and food was just very mediocre.
3
That's one of the must-see location in Singapore. But don't do it with kids and between lunch--dinner time. It is extremely inconvenient for children. After 1 and before 6 pm the personal is in a kind of siesta.
3
My 10th time doing lunch at L33. last visit was more than 6 maths ago. Very disappointed with this experience. Our orders were mixed out with the next table who came later, resulting in some of our main courses delivered to the next table and a long wait. Tho the appetizers spread was good, thedesert selection was a just a few oranges and green apples. And they were not fresh - the apples were bruised and soft to the touch and the oranges looked really tired. They were not served chilled either.
5
Amazing views of the Singapore skyline without the pretentious service and grossly outrageous prices other rooftop bars offer. This microbrewery is friendly and welcoming and offers drinks at just the average expensive price for Singapore city bars. The beers are great, worth trying the beer flight to taste them all. Food is good too, bar snacks are quite substantial and two were enough to share for a light lunch. Much prefer to bring guests here to see the view over the bay and city building than the bar at marina bay sands. Food drinks and overall experience is very good. Also easily accessible via MRT. Downtown station on the same line is a short walk and raffles place on the red line is about a 7-10min walk but all underground and easy to follow signs.
4
On the expensive side, but what a delicious meal. The Ploughman's Table could feed an army and offered such an amazing spread. The Dory fish (in beer batter) and langoustine were exceptional. The potato they was served on was a bit overcooked, but that's alright. Great views as well. Definitely worth a visit
1
I visited with my friend on Tuesday July 5th. The Atmosphere was nice - View, Music, Lighting, and table setting. Unfortunately I found this restaurant had terrible value for average food. The menu is heavy on the meat and that might offer better value but my date preferred seafood and we ordered the Scallops at 28++ (33$) and the plate had 2 small scallops the size of the cherry tomatoes that accompanied the Burrata (which was delicious). Her main course was the Carabineros at 40++ (47$) which was 2 small prawns (literally the size of my small finger) with a small pot of warm soba noodles. The prawn heads were twice the size of the tail. I will try to upload pictures shortly for all to see how disappointing this is. Maybe go for the view and drinks or try the meat but definitely stay away from the seafood there
5
The dinner was great. The atmosphere, the food, the beer, the view. Everything made us a perfect night out. When you visit Singapore I really do recommend to go there to have the stunning view across Marina Bay. Don't miss it. The staff was present all the time and was absolutely lovely.It was my boyfriends birthday. We are happy we got there and we got an unforgettable dinner
5
I go Often in level33 and I can say that is really the top il all the terms. Wonderful location, unbelievable fantastic craft beers and innovative kitchen. Everything you taste you can feel there is the hands of some master chef If i check all the sides this is the best place i ever been.
4
I decided to take an international guest here for the views. We were not disappointed! The restaurant accommodated my request to be seated near the window for a view which was lovely. The menu looked interesting and finally my guest chose Kangaroo and I chose the Pork. I have to say the serving portions looked quite small but we had order a side dish as well so we were ok. My pork was definitely not the best. Not sure what cut it was but it was very tough. So disappointing in that respect. I also chose a bottle of wine and they had run out - apparently the only wine that had run out! So I am not sure if I would go back for the food but if you wanted to take someone up for the views then go for drinks out on the balcony
5
It was a perfect catch up session with an old friend, good ambience, good food & most importantly great service. I recommended it for the lovely spread they serve with their set lunches. I love sitting outside taking in the views while catching up, ideal place to escape the hassle and bustle for the brief moment. They even have a small area where smokers can enjoy coffee undisturbed. The aroma of oriole's coffee is a must have and if you still have alittle space for dessert, their chocolate lava cake is a the definite choice
5
The restaurant has nice view of sea and marina bay sands. The executive lunch was delightful, we could help ourselves to the appetizers and cheese, these were decent selection. The prawns were fresh and tasty.
5
Was there for farewell party. Food is really good, ordered T-bone steak, and of course - beer. Beer is really good too. Topping that, the view is just breath taking...
4
Great place to catch up with friends over beer and bar food. The set lunch was very worth every cent.
4
Good Atmosphere, nice view, Good Service, Food for us is Average, Good Beer, Easy to come near MRT, we will visit again.
3
Good environment , The food are totally different with last few years back. I think the food last few years are a lot nicer. Waiters are ok.
5
I go to Level33 on many occasions - very often I bring my business partners to enjoy the impressive view, their home-brewed beer and the food.I'm not big into meat but really like their sizzling beef. My colleagues always order their steaks or the ploughman's platter. My all-time favorites are the sizzling prawns, their salads and the cheese platter.Definitely a great deal is their lunch buffet. Great salads, cheese, pasta etc. and good choices for the mains. But make sure you have a reservation - it's always very busy.They are always very sweet when I came for special occasions e.g birthdays etc. and surprised us with a small desert.The staff is never tired taking pictures for guests (& they have to do it all the time besides being busy serving).Highly recommend this place for business or private occasions
1
Separate Reservation systems leads to disappointment. Online reservation seems to be only for indoors & if you want to enjoy the views (which is the whole reason for going) - you will need to book by calling the restaurant directly. Requests for outside table met with deference and robotic scripts, very disappointin
4
Had a lunch here with colleagues, as part of a birthday celebration for some of us.The place is really nice; all that natural light flooding the restaurant is refreshing. The "brewery" touch was an interesting sight. Service was good; however the food was just a little bit inconsistent in some dishes. I ordered the Gourmet Set Lunch and my beef tartare, though generally tasty with the crispy bread, was a little too squishy for my liking.Main course was a sirloin steak, and oddly enough the server actually asked me to cut it through the middle to see if it's cooked well enough. That's a first -- I've never had any restaurant serve me my steak, but ask me to cut up for them to see if it's ok. Shouldn't that be the chef's responsibility and skill? As it was, I came to discover that the left side of the steak was done nicely, but toward the right side of the steak, it was very undercooked and much too raw. Puts the chef's skill into question alright.Overall, I had a pleasant experience here, though I expected the food to be much better, considering the price I'm paying
2
Service was very, very slow. We had to collar someone to even take our order. The food took an hour to come out and when it did it was cold. The Kangaroo Loin I had was both tough and cold, as was the steak we ordered. The prawns were not properly cooked. The cod was fine. When the food was brought out the server described in detail each dish - I wouldn't mind if this was fine dining but being told what baby corn is was somewhere between amusing and annoying. Perhaps I was irritable after such a long wait - but this meal was over a week ago now so I'm not writing this while still emotional. In all fairness the food was well presented.My parents had just flown in that day for a short stop over and if they hadn't been with me I would have walked sooner and given the staff a piece of my mind. If it wasn't for the view - and admittedly nice beer, there would be no reason to visit. My advice - go for a beer, not for food. The IPA is nice, and if you get there before 8pm its reasonably priced.
1
Wanted to organized an event for my company.. But seem very unfriendly services with lots of term and condition. with payment required stamped with Date, time and please note is local time. when Singaporean are talking to Singaporean. Level 33 afraid we will use Europe time
5
Great dinning at level 33, they prepared a birthday surprised as requested. And arranged a great view sitting location. Food prices weren't too expensive.
5
Hi we have been staying in Singapore for 10 days and have dropped in here a few times. Haven't tried the food but enjoyed the beer and the view is to die for.
Aldo our waiter was superb.

Both the food and Beer were excellent. Staff is very attentive. Take the time at night to view Singapore as well
4
The only gripe I have is that it took over an hour to serve our mains. We did order the Banjo though. If you like Australian reds give the Rockford Basket Press Shiraz a try.
4
We chose to watch the sunset and have a few beers at Level 33 as it would be a cheaper option than Marina Bay Sands and not as crowded.The beer was good and the view is amazing but you need to book,we arrived around 4pm and most tables were reserved but they found us one that was fine and as the afternoon wore on it was packed,service was fantastic but it is not cheap,but hey it is Singapore and the view is worth it
5
Stunning views across Singapore, craft beers (and more) together with succulent roast dishes (and more) ... how could you go wrong?The roast pork in particular was truly exceptional.A good selection of craft beers and a generous wine list.This venue has something for everyone. It's obviously not a "cheap eats' offering but for the quality of the delivery I thought it very reasonable. Lazy Sunday lunch for 4 with friends in our case. Loved every minute
5
My Son and I dined at this restaurant on the 11th June and can highly recommend it for a special occasion. The food and service was excellent. You could go out onto the balcony with a view that left you speechless.....overlooking the marina and Singapore we were able to watch the Gardens by the Bay show and laser show, unbelievable! You can also have just drinks and a small meal out there instead of sitting in the restaurant. Cost for entrÃ©e and main with one drink each $255.00 so not cheap but worth it
5
We have been regularly for the Sunday roast and it never disappoints. The lamb is great and can feed 3-4 people, and we have also enjoyed the beef and pork (with lots of crackling). The price is reasonable being around $70 per head including alcohol (share the beer paddle between 2) and dessert. The views of Marina Bay are very good and overseas visitors always enjoy it here
2
When we first arrived we were greeted and walked to the back of the restaurant. Not only did the table have a view of NOTHING, it smelled like the sewer. We asked to be moved but nothing was available. The food was good and the staff ignored us just enough to keep me from asking to be moved again. So we ate our dinner and left without another word about how much the table smelled or an apology.
1
Had a dinner with 2 business associate. The services needs overhaul, does bot match that type of restaurant, seems like a service standard from casual dining. Food is so ordinary and menu needs revamp to accompanies the view and atmosphere. Takw for granted the view is good and is in business central district. Unless is free, i wont go there again
5
This is our favourite place in Singapore to take friends. It has a great atmosphere the food and drink are great and the view spectacular! It is a little expensive but worth it! Advise booking in advance it's also very popular.
5
Good service, nice food. They even call beforehand to confirm the appointment. Will come again another day.
5
Great views, great service and amazing food!!
We ordered a selection of entrees and every thing we ordered had such beautiful textures and flavours.
Can't wait to come back and order more!
3
Usually my Favourite Sunday haunt but this time service was awful and food was cold. Very disappointing. View remains amazing.
5
Great atmosphere, food and a stunning view! Amazing to watch the light show from marina bay sands! Definitely would go again for more mojitos and fat fries.
4
Came here couple of time. But Never get tired of the view. Nice service and goof food. My favorite is beef sizzler and sizzling prawn.. Super yummy.
5
Best Brewery in town. Went for lunch and had an assorted of food that friends ordered all over the table. Waitress was amazing. always knew when to come over! Good atmosphere and even though you cant enjoy eating outside the view of marina bay was the top. Even have glasses you can buy to remember the place. Took a napkin and coaster. ha. Love to take a date there if I ever go back
1
A place that lives off its location. Sadly poorly managed. Food is ok, beer selection is quite good but more attention could be paid to getting the individual brews "just right." Could be that the poor service just spoiled the entire experience and otherwise good food and drinks became mediocre to us
2
Really, this was less than average. Almost had to beg for service, although the staff were nice when they did help you. Overpriced for average meals. I was there a few years back and it was a different place. If it wasn't for the view, it would no longer be in business. Clearly really disappointed
1
Happened to go to this Level 33 with a party of three.There were no seats, so I had to stay at the bar area with my friends which was okay.Since it was Firday walk-in, i simply enjoyed the view and had that testers with 5 small glasses of beer and steak, which turned okay.Beer was not impressive and neither was steak. But most obnoxious thing was this waitress (or clerk) named Sue.Since our bill was not coming to us after 20 minutes, i walked to the check out counter and Sue was working on a piles of bills.I explained the situation and politely asked Sue to process my bill first.Then she with this annoying attitude got back at me that "Mamm, we are very busy as you can see."We didn't smile rather made this shutting face, which was very obnoxious and incredibly annoying. I don't think she should be taking a job to face any types of customers.Sue, you ruined my night with your attitude. Once again, that's not how you want to treat your customer, okay? Consider taking other job, maybe something that does involve no interaction with people or the one that you can throw your tantrum.Period
3
We have tried the beer dinner and most of them were good. Unfortunately the waitress had no service mind. So we dont think we will return or recommend our friends.
3
The service was of average standard and the food was expensive. View from the restaurant was good though.
4
Nice food although portion was small. However, the waiter was polite and did tell us we may have to place more if we are big eaters. View was wonderful.
4
There was no baby chair but they allowed us to put our stroller in. Good food good service good view. Friendly waitress played with my boys while we waited for the food.
4
The view from here was one of the best overall panoramas of the city. At night, the lights made it spectacularService was good. Food was ok. It is a micro brewery and the beers were niceNothing bad about it, however only the view would tempt me bac
3
We didn't have a reservation but walked in hence we were told all dining tables area were full and we could only sit at the bar-side table for dinner. We had a starter of "Pig & Snail" which wasn't anything to shout about. The pork strips that were rolled and deep fried was very dry and the escargot sitting on top of the pork was pretty tasteless. I had the main of "Ocean Trout" which was done very well although it was a tad salty but my dragonfruity mocktail saved my blood pressure. My friend had "Gnocchi" which was also pretty tasty with the right chewy texture and complementing ingredients but again the lamb was dry. For desserts, we both shared "Rhubarb Duo" which was rhubarb vegetable coupled with green pea ice cream, which looked and tasted quite like pistachio? or maybe my brains tricked me to believe so because of the color. It was a nice tangy combination. After dinner about 2.5hrs later, we were given an outdoor table so that we could enjoy the view. In my opinion, the food was pretty much average, the prices that we paid were definitely for the beautiful Singapore Skyline view rather than the food itself
5
Our son, a Singapore resident, took my wife and me to Level 33, which is at the top of the Standard Chartered building. Entry is free, but men must wear long trousers and shoes !It is renowned for its craft beer, which are brewed there, and they are expensive, but hey, well worth it when you consider you are getting such wonderful, panoramic views of Singapore !Tip: go at dusk and watch the city light up 
4
Not only is there a great taster paddle of five of their beers so you can work out what suits your palate. The Stout I think is superb. There is also a seriously indulgent rack of five puddings which I highly recommend. All backed by one of the best views in Singapore
5
I've visited LeVel 33 two times now - both with my boyfriend and with my family. I was impressed by the food and the service both times!I managed to book terrace tables both times at relatively short notice for "drinks and bites" (although you are still able to choose foods from the a la carte menu if you want to!)Both times we ordered a selection of their "beer dining" foods to share between ourselves and were impressed with the amount of the food and the quality - particular highlights were definitely the pork belly and the fish and chips. This can then be coupled with their beer paddle - offering a selection of theirs ales and stouts or with any other drinks from their menus. The only negative point of the evening would definitely be the quality of the cocktails - but it is primarily a beer establishment so I can't complain too much! We finished with the assiette of desserts - a wonderful selection of miniature desserts with a beer ice cream!And all of this was perfectly complimented by the wonderful view over Marina Bay at night
4
I 'choped' the restaurant intending to have its saturday buffet having viewed both its own website and its advertisement on 'Chope'. Needless to say we were slightly miffed when we were informed when we arrived that for that particular day that a 'special' a la carte menu was on offer and no buffet. As we were hungry and already there plus items on the menu sounded appealing, we decided to try it out. We both started off with octopi. Mains of pork and grilled cod. Ending in a triple scoop ice cream/gelato/sorbet and fondant. We also had the beer taster paddle. By and large the food was good. Well prepared and presented with interesting play on tastes and textures. The pork started off a little dry but got sufficiently moist as one progressed. The cod was nicely grilled although the eating experience could have been greatly improved if it hadn't smelt so fishy. The fondant was nice but the triple scoop was perhaps the least impressive overall. I like my beers cold so by the time i got to my stout, it was warmer than i would have liked it. Perhaps they could serve the paddle in ice.
5
The restaurant is typically so rich in visual detail that’s it’s worth taking time to come up and the service staffs are friendly.
4
We selected the executive lunch with buffet appetisers.
The appetisers are good. But main course so-so only
3
Actually we have a reservation but we can not seat in terace. It is okay but after dinner we want to take picture and go out side. There are just have a chair and desk for terace customer.
3
The Sunday roast is okay, good to try once but nothing that will make you go back again. Servers were polite enough but I think can do better.
Food wise, try the stuffings it's really good. Cappuccino was disappointing as it wasn't hot.
3
Prices went up drastically! Value and portions declined. No desert included anymore. Wayyyyyy too expensive for what you get. Not happy
5
Finding this place was a bit tricky - I guess that's part of the draw. there's an elevator but no buttons. We had drinks and appetizers at sunset, and the view was fantastic. You could see the super trees, the bay, the building with the boat on top. In my opinion, the best view I saw from Singapore. Its craft brew, and the beer was ok. The appetizers were also ok (not great). I found the service in Singapore as a whole to be a bit robotic bordering on rude. The hostess here was no exception (she was rude to me), but the waiter was one of the two great servers I had in the entire trip. Its moderately expensive, but you're paying for the view and its worth it. Make reservations or show up really early
5
Went Level 33 a couple of days ago, tried their beer and one of their dish deserve to be commented, Gnocchi - it shredded lamb shoulder mixed with goat cheese create bring out the best of both! Those who love lamb should try this dish! The Brittany cod however is a more simpler dish.
4
This is a great place to unwind with a cold craft beer after a hard day work. The view from here is fabulous and you can enjoy a great view of the sunset and followed by the night view of the city skyline.You can also have dinner here. Overall the food is good and ambience great. However price is on the high side
4
The restaurant provides a view of the city as well as the iconic Marina Bay Sands! Request for the seating in the open (and the hopefully the weather behaves). They have their own brewery which is worth a try. However, getting an advance booking is difficult (not sure why). They take walk-ins and when we visited on a week day we did manage to a good place. Food was okay
3
The view and the beer are Level 33's saving graces. The menu has ample choice but the food is distinctly average for the cost. Further bumped by the fact sides are required to make it a complete meal. The service is absolutely woeful, even by SG standards. Front of house are quick to meet you from the lift and show to your table (always make a reservation for lunch/dinner) but after that you'll spend your time asking for the waiter/waitress. A simple drink and main course after work took close to 90mins, in a place that still had some empty tables... Couldn't be bothered to wait for a dessert. Reserve an outside table, grab a drink and take in the view.
4
Its my second time to LeVel 33 and i must say that the staffs are very friendly and helpful and the atmosphere and view are a plus point added to your dining experience.
4
My local friend took us to this restaurant and it has one of the best view..... The food was also great, but this restaurant is a bit pricy.
5
Always great to visit LeVeL 33 for Sunday roast. Comfortable, great food and quality service. The roast pork meal is large and the side of broccoli was a good compliment.
1
Go only for the lovely view.. The service is the worst you will find in Singapore.
Overpriced and pretentious. The service is really slow.
4
Sad unable to obtain reservation for seats for our dessert outside for better night view. Ambience was good.
5
Absolutely stunning view of Singapore! The drinks were amazing, we tasted some of their beer in their taster set, and they accommodated some extra requests which was very nice of them. Only downside - if you are outside, there is no seating available, so be prepared to stand for most of the night. The bar food is deliciously mouth-watering
3
I used to enjoy coming to Level 33 for the set lunch menu in previous years. It had been a long time since my last visit, when I went there for a birthday lunch celebration last week. The Executive Set Lunch used to be $33 ++ and offered an appetiser buffet of salads and cold meats, a choice of mains, and then back to the buffet for a small but adequate selection of desserts. Fast forward to 2016, the Executive Set Lunch is no longer $33 but $42++, so be aware of that. There is also a $7 supplement if you choose the steak. The salad buffet was nice with a selection of meats and seafood. Slices of rib eye were so delicious, I went back for more only to find it replaced with ham! Main course supreme of chicken was awfully dry and lacked flavour. As for dessert - there was no buffet selection any more! Cheese and fruit was on offer, but even then the fruit was not cut up, but merely a bowl of apples and oranges! Not asking for a big selection, but perhaps one choice of dessert should be offered for a proper set lunch, considering the increase in price. Service was really slow! It was hard to catch hold of wait staff, but our server Mel was very pleasant and obliging. Disappointing, would not recommend for a special occasion. Go there for the views and the beer, the food needs to improve
2
I have heard a lot about level 33 and as expected the view was amazing. I went for the saturday brunch and had the free flow craft beers which were made in house. Beers were so-so, instead I would prefer the blue stout that was executed beautifully.The food spread was on the other hand a major let down. It was so small with a few salad mix that was about the same, a small charcuterie, some breads and cooked food like the ham which was left dry and hard. The nice one and the only food that seemed to flow was the cheese sausage with bacon that was delicious. Foie gras was already pan seared and left out in the open which in my opinion, could be done better with a made to order system. There was no egg dishes nor hot pasta dishes nor any fishes etc, food typical of a brunch. Desserts was forgettable. At SGD 113? It is as the title says
5
We celebrated Team success at Level 33. Was expecting just main course and a dessert. We had more. We had seafood and cold cuts buffet with the mains. Had so much seafood that we were struggling with the mains. Made it very worth it. And the view is breath-taking at Level 33. Thank you for making our celebration a memorable experience
4
The restaurant was a nice experience. The food was good and the beer was ok (the "European" beers for an European were not impressive). Good and thoughtful service that took us to a balcony table for drinks after dinner. The view is the best added value of the whole experience
5
We went here shortly after arriving in Singapore. They have some fantastic beers and stunning views! Don't expect a cheap drink but it is well worth it for the experience, once you find the lift up!
5
Great View with excellent food and service from service crew.
Great place to chill out with friends and family after a long tired day or what.
Able to take a good look at the view of MBS and around the CBD area
4
The food was above average while the ambience and service was excellence. Will definitely head back in future.
5
Great food and stunning views over the city. Staff attentive and saved us a table outdoor after our meal which was thoughtful.
5
A great place to have a drink with stunning birds eye views of the bay, Fullerton, Marina Sands Bay and surrounding anchorages. They have a microbrewery with range of beers to try. Good service and attentive staff.Due to lack of time we visited mid day but recommend visiting at dusk for best light / lit harbour and a sundowner or two
4
I cannot believe it took me so Long to try LeVeL 33. It has its own private elevator in MBFC so make sure you look out for the entrance carefully or you may miss it.View is stunning, overlooking the entire Bay Area from MBS to the Fullerton. In my opinion probably one of the best in the area as you can see a mixture of modern architecture and colonial style (Fullerton).Prices are on the steep side but not as bad as one would expect for this kind of location. Beer was very affordable although I suggest giving the blond lager a miss and try another brew. Foie gras was melt-in-your-mouth delightful!!! Roast lamb was tender but I felt could use some salt. I suggest also giving the gnocchi a try- sounds simple but definitely delicious.Overall not somewhere I would recommend as an Everyday eating area but definitely a nice place to celebrate a special occasio
4
A few months back I wrote a review rating Level 33's service horrible and not up to standard. Following that unpleasant episode, I was positively surprised when I got contacted by Charlotte, Manager on the team, whom apologised on behalf of the staff.Charlotte showed a genuine interest in the matter, she took time to listen to my complaint, acknowledge it and act on it by inviting my colleagues and I back for lunch - entirely on the house. We accepted.Today we enjoyed a very nice lunch at Level 33, the service on this occasion was top notch and the professional staff made our stay very pleasant. We felt very well taken care of. To my surprise, Level 33 also revamped the Executive lunch and offers a greater selection at the buffet area - I'm Italian and I found the Burrata cheese a very nice addition. Officially thank you for inviting us back, for making our second visit so much better than the first and for offering the lunch also to a last minute friend who joined us - we all had a great time. Level 33 we are pleased to have given you a second chance and you will see us again
3
We were booked in for 8.30pm. We got our table at 8.45 which was fine. Our server came to take our order but then walked away as his iPad didn't work. We then waited another 15 mins to order. The food however was very good we all ordered the steak and lobster tail. What was disappointing was our server. He was sullen, unhelpful and at times a little rude. For the service industry we felt he was very poor. The deserts were also good but again we waited 10 mins for our bill. There was no 'how was your meal? ' etc. On the whole I would not visit again. Although the food was very good it was also very expensive. For the three of us it cost 300 Singapore dollars for a beer each and two courses. All in all Â£50 each which was somewhat of the expensive side.
5
Went to Level 33 on a Sunday night for my wife's birthday whilst on holiday. Made reservation on line - no dramas at all. Service was excellent, food was even more excellent (and reasonably priced for Singapore standards and given the location). Moved onto the terrace after finishing our main for dessert which arrived with 'happy birthday' written in chocolate on the plate. Nice touch. Couldn't fault meal or service. Highly recommended. Only downside is that as in many restaurants in Singapore the price of wine is ridiculously expensive - so good reason to stick with the fantastic beer
4
Celebrated my daughter birthday, atmosphere and service was excellent, my family order their meat and it came perfect except for my fish which was dry, which they did exchange it for me. the server was very attentive unfortunately i don't know his name, It's a place i would go again as you do get a beautiful view if the weather is nice.
5
Servicd is great. I mentioned to the server that it was a persons birthday at the table and the server brought a candle with dessert. So thoughtful. They also took nice pictures of us on the balcony. They are wonderful!
5
My Aunt had a wonderful time. To quote her "I never had food this good back in Marland. The cook is excellent"
5
I sat here for an afternoon enjoying nice beers and a great view. Staff were very nice and price was reasonable for Singapore. Was absolutely perfect early on when it was quiet, definitely the choice viewpoint bar for that relaxed vibe.
5
LOVE this place!It was a Sunday so the Sunday Roast menu was on offer. I had the Lamb Shank and it was to die for. Complimenting it with a paddle sample of their craft beers. My fave was the stout, but all 5 brews where acceptable. Overall will definitely return and recommend highly
4
Good place for a dinner - reserve in advance to have table near the window. However as they also have a balcony you won't have the view - more people sitting next to your window :)So after the dinner it's better to reserve a place on a terrace for a cocktail to really enjoy the view (they have lights show there every hour starting from 8+- 10-15 mins).Music, food is good. For me the combination of the location/style of the place didn't match with the brewery..
5
We visited Level 33 with our 1,5 year old daughter. Without reservation we had a table in the outside standing area. Amazing view over Marina Bay and over to Marina Bay Sands! Bar gets more crowded after sunset, but people were quite relaxed. Service was good. Half liter beer for around $15 with chicken wings for $ 12,50 and fat french fries for $ 9 is good value for Singapore! The IPA was quite good, the Lager was a bit disappointing. Overall a very nice bar with a perfect view and great for taking some beers and some nice pictures
4
Went recently for an anniversary dinner with my girlfriend, after seeing the good reviews and pictures. Called in advance a few times to clarify on the booking, for certain special arrangements to be made, and for a seat by the viewing glass panels. Guess was initially slightly disappointed with the replies that they could only put a note down and will review the sitting situation on that day even if it was a celebratory occasion. Nonetheless, was pleasantly surprised on the day when we were seated inside next to the viewing glass. View was obstructed by the outdoor seating guests who were there to soak in the view as well, but the ambiance within the restaurant was still beautiful, largely due to the brewery tanks and warm lights. Tried a bottle of wine and a beer tasting platter, both were decent, the experience played up by the atmosphere. Food was decent as well. Actual table service though seemed a little cold, and oddly a slight hint of disinterest, rushed by the waiters at times, and at other times slow they were slow to respond. Still, was a great night - we moved to the outdoor seating to continue with drinks and the open air view was beautiful.Summary of experience:- Service: 3/5- Food: 4/5- Drinks: 4/5- Ambiance: 4.5/
4
Crowded even on weekdays but the selection of beer and nice vantage view of the barrage is worth it. However, if you are not seated outdoors, you might not be able to enjoy the nice scenic view.The beer tasting set is quite worth trying before sinking in to the beer of your choice
5
First of all, Thank you for your the best services!Especially, my special mention for Ms. Joycena, We had experienced very nice services from you, she was keeping to ask our food conditions and response our special request with her kindliness.Thank you, and We have to visit one more time with happiness.
3
The bar has a spectacular setting that looks over the whole marina. The beer and wine selection is ok and they brew their own beer which is actually really nice. I only had a few of the bar snacks last time i was there and they were good but slightly on the pricy side compared to other places but maybe you pay for the view. Would definitely go back again for the view and beer
4
It's it near ur office and you're in the mood for great night of dinner , booze and view , spoil ur wife or girlfriend !
5
Excellent service and food and it was a delight experience with a close friend. Thank yo for a great experience!
4
I really enjoyed this bar, the craft beer cocktails were excellent, a bit different and tasty! 👍 the view is stunning over the marina and the skyline of Singapore.
4
I made a reservation at LeVeL 33 for my family who was visiting Singapore. Highly recommend the restaurant for its microbrewery and clean, simple food.
4
Went for lunch. It has a nice view and good western food. Lunch is a semi buffet, order main course with buffet salad. Food is good quality and nice view. But service is a bit slow.
4
I went to LeVel 33 on a Tuesday night. The place was crammed with all the seats outside taken, so I had to sit inside and watch the view from there (air conditioning was nice, though :). Need to go again sometime when it hopefully isn't too crowded
3
Yes, the place is nice and most off all the view is breathtaking (that is... if you can get the proper table...). And yes, the food is good and reasonnably priced. But you don't go there to eat, you go there to have a drink, and that's the weak point : cocktails are poor and outrageously priced
5
Firstly, locating this place may not be easy to some as the lift lobby is at the side hidden in view and the signs leading to it is small( I myself chanced upon this place)Try to come in early as it gets VERY crowded on some days and all the tourists take photos and all so it gets abit tangled.( well i can't blame them, its a beautiful view.)I usually come here for a beer on the weekend and chill and soak in the view. I should stress this place is VERY PRICEY with a beer going at 20 ish for a pint, the snack menu at the bar is not worth it at all, so give it a miss. Dont give the beers a miss as they are crafted there itself and are actually pretty good(and dare i say worth the price?).so overall, come here for a drink, give the bar menu a miss. Oh also its a good place for a fancy unforgettable date
4
It's not the easiest place to find, with it's private elevator hidden in the lobby of Tower 1 in the Marina Bay Financial Centre, but the view you get from the top of the tower, overlooking the bay as the sun sets is easily worth it. The craft beer is excellent, as are their unusual cocktails; just be aware that it fills up quickly on weeknights, as people from the nearby offices gather to unwind. It's probably worthwhile reserving if you're a larger grou
4
We'd read the reviews and decided to go up to level 33 to see the light show and taste the unique beer. We weren't disappointed! Level 33 has its own lift. Go into the tower 1 foyer and the lift is separate on the left hand side. The beer was very tasty and around $17 a pint. You can eat there or simply have drinks by the bar or out on the balcony area which is a great viewpoint to see the city and the light show off marina bay sands.
5
Excellent service, beautiful view of Marina Bay and sea side
Had a lovely time last evening. Friendly staff.
5
Fantastic view, food was awesome and friendly services :)
Will definitely go again and take more guests there
4
The great view and the breeze from the sea together with a taste selection of 6 different beers made this place very unique for us. Even the prices were fair.
4
Really enjoyable venue with a stunning view of Marina Bay and the city. Good mixture of drinks and refreshing own beers and varied and reasonably priced (for Singapore) wine list. Food was good (the desserts the most striking part).
4
Be mesmerized by the good view but just too bad it is not 360 degrees round view. You can see the Marina Bay Sands Sky Park and its surroundings like esplanade, marina squarem suntec city malls and mandarin. Within the restuarant itself, all glass round, great place to meet friends and chatthe night away. As for food, fine dining of average quality and taste. The service is a tat below its food, rudely snugging plates and cultery to clients chatting at tables. Felt that they can be better.Dining sets starts from S$78++ for 4 course meal,entree, starter, main and dessert. Quantity is kinda low, cant fill my belly at least. Friend choke on vegetarian pasta and did not finish as it tasted wierd. Disappointing for a great place. Limited mocktail selection but plenty of beers and wines. The restuarant has its very own elevator at Tower 1. You can redeem parking at ground foor. They got private rooms for VIPs
3
Easily take a MRT to Marina Link or just grab a taxi will be easierFind Financial Tower 1 and go straight direct to level 33View was excelent.. however can be packed during certain hours..Food was just ok... service just ok.. but if you wanna hang out and relax enjoying drinks with great view - level 33 one of the optionsOnce you off from level 33 sometimes quite a hasle to grab a taxi from taxi standthe best.. use MRT if still open.. orcall the taxi company directly or easily use the apps for transportations optio
4
This is apparently the highest micro brewery in the world??? we went in a Saturday and tried the special brunch... There are several options,(in brief).... as much of the brews and food as you want.....beer cocktails and food, Or food only and other drinks as required... it kind of worked out at a reasonable price if you are a beer aficionado, they are very good, I understand. However the brunch buffet was excellent. I adore fois gras... (So wrong on all levels, I know) but great options, lovely service and amazing views over Singapore...It is situated in the Marina Bay Area of the city, but I'd quite easy to find even if situated in an office block.... Well worth a visit though...
4
We went there for drinks on the terras. Reservation of a table only possible if spending $60 pp. So we didn't make a reservation. We were there around 18:30. Beautiful view. When it got dark even better!We ordered the sizzler beef and fat chips. Both were good.Waiters were kind but you notice that it can be busy with people who come for the view, making pictures, wanting a table....
5
We visited on a Friday night. We planned a short weekend trip to Singapore and wanted to experience dining with a nice night view. Found out about Level 33 via the web. As the title suggests the food and beer was great. The service was excellent and the view was beautiful, even from our indoor table
3
The restaurant offers great views. The food is not exceptional but apparently they change the menu regularly. You can have starters buffet and then choose you main course. Or you have 2 or 3 course menu options. The salad buffet was good but then I had the fish cake which was tasteless. Coffee was horrible.It is not too expensive if you take the buffet menu
4
They advertise themselves as the highest brewpub in Singapore and the view is really terrific -- especially at night. Good beer selections and interesting menu
4
Went for drinks with work colleagues. Amazing views across the bay, good selection of beers and nice nibbles. They were very busy and service was slow. We kept on having to go and find a waiter to come and take drinks orders.
4
Really good atmosphere in the place. We started our evening with some of their local brew, followed by a good meal. We finished up with some cocktails on the terrace and an amazing view of the city. Highly recommend.
4
easily booked reservation online, table was ready on time. atmosphere was great for my biz dinner. would choose this place again for business ogain

I have been a frequent user of Level 33 for both Business and Social use, sadly my last visit has likely put me off using the place again. I booked a table for 5 (family) for dinner, the service was absolutely appalling, the waiting staff were extremely busy and under real pressure. However, when booking a table at an establishment such as Level 33 this should not be a consideration and quite frankly it ruined the evening. Due to waiting for the food the food was at best tepid, furthermore the standard of the food was not what I have become accustomed to at this establishment. Being my second visit in as many weeks the difference between the two visits could not be so different. Sadly management need to carefully review staffing levels if they hope to maintain any level or standard

Went there for the view. Took a foreign friend there to enjoy the sights. The view is nice on the terrace. But they don't accept reservations unless you want to spend a min. of $60 per person. We were only going for drinks so we had no reservations. We got there around 5pm and the terrace was full. The service was curt. We were given either standing seats or indoor seats which didn't have such a good view. (You have to stand up to see) The service was slow and curt even though there were probably only 10 tables in service. We were seated near the bar and yet we didn't get service for a long while. We were thirsty but were motioned to wait. We finally got service, took orders and STILL had wait quite a while for drinks. They are drinks. Not dishes. You just pour them. Why should it take so long? And there are many staff. At least 8 people. It shouldn't wait so long. There weren't seats in the terrace when we arrived but they were later vacated. We asked to move outside. The staff said - oh there's people standing waiting for tables. But we came before them! Strange service ... Eventually we did get a seat at the terrace. With sour faced service staff...A large weiÃŸbier cost $18++ at happy hour. Not cheap not expensive. Brewed in house. The taste is quite refreshing. But my friend was not pleased with her daquiri. Oh well. Would I be back? Maybe. Only if I've guests.

Go for the views if nothing else. Food well presented but meat a bit underdone and desserts overly sweet. Service not super attentive but respond quick if asked. Fusion meat and seafood with whacky names. It is the view though if you can get it by window facing the bay that make this restaurant worth a visit

I loved the flights of beer but this is not a new concept. As good as any I've tasted but not better. Just visited for the fun of it but couldn't sit outside as its not covered and had been raining. Comfortable chairs with no views available but not much fun sitting inside. Sting in the tail 15 dollars for a 100 ml glass. We know the owner is coining it in so please no ripping off for small souvenirs.Not cheap, not really suitable for families, Sunday afternoon many male business men drinking.There's plenty better ways to see over Singapore ba

Choosing your favourite bar in the world is quite a challenge, but every time I visit Level33 I say that this is it. The views are simply stunning, with a great vista of downtown, Marina Bay and everything in-between. The beer is excellent, with 5 on tap to choose from and some great beer cocktails. For the first time we ate from the main menu this time, and we're not disappointed with the food. The steak was excellent and all plates were cleaned!Service is very good; friendly and warm. The staff were doing a sterling job trying to move an obnoxious group away from a reserved table out on the balcony - very professional despite some annoying people!Book ahead to secure a table outside, and expect people to want to take pictures next to you; you'd want to if you were stood inside at the bar

Went to Level 33 with friends to chill. Paddle beer was awesome and a must try. Food was bit pricey but taste is good. Only reservation was abit confusing and we need to do it online when we called that afternoon to reserve. View is perfect though.
5
Went on a Saturday afternoon around 3pm. I was quiet so we could sit outside looking at the beautiful views and drinking amazing beer. Will go back!!
4
The best aspect of this bar is the fantastic views of Marina Bay and the city. The drinks are nothing to write home about and predictably expensive. The bar is in the financial district after all.
4
Spectacular View with Awesome Service!
The food can be better with that kinda price tag. Ordered the duck confit, pork and lamb. Beer was great!
4
We went here after walking around the city for hours. It provided a wonderful break from the city buzz and the best view of Singapore from above. Instead of paying entry fees somewhere else, go here, get a beer and enjoy the view.
5
Greeted by golden tanks as I entered the restaurant which is uniquely distinctive, the outdoor seating by the balcony was something to die for. The view was magnificent, food were not overly priced, own brewed beer was absolutely amazing!!Lucky me, my dining experience was topped with an outstanding staff, Dharmendra who took care of my order, introducing the beers from the sampling platter that I was excited about, checking on my plate's satisfaction - all that with a great big smile. People were constantly streaming in, it's the one place where I have ever been that people wouldn't mind to be seated or even standing around to have drinks / snacks within their groups - not forgetting that awesome view.Thank you Level 33 for making my solo trip not that lonely after all
5
There are not many food and watering holes in Singapore that manage to provide the same high level of ambiance, location view, amount of food per paid Dollar and quality of drink as they do in Level 33.Combine that with a very good service and extremely friendly staff and you have a place I will continue to visit frequently
3
I can't agree with the reviews, especially on the quality of the food. The location is great, but food was (apart from the Scallops) mostly mediocre and pretty tasteless. Good presentation, but poor execution. No value for money in my opinion. Better just go for drinks and skip the food. There is much better places in Singapore to spend your hard earned cash. Will not return.
5
We celebrated my in-laws' wedding anniversary at LeVeL 33 and enjoyed every moment of it. The place has a nice ambience, and the staffs were very helpful and polite. I dropped my lipstick at the ledge (we had the table furthest away from the counter) and one of the waiter went beyond his call of duty and helped me take it out. Sorry I didn't get your name!We enjoyed the food, esp the gambas and my father-in-law loved his beer samplers (and eventually got another pint, of course). The choices for desserts are so-so but the view makes up for it :
4
To be honest I did not try their food. We came here on a recommendation from a local for a good beer with a view. The view is incredible. Even better than at the marina sands in my opinion as you get to see the whole skyline from it. Pretty cool place. Good beer!
5
The place is amazing and a must night visit if you need to watch Singapore glowing in dark. The place has excellent wine and yes brewed beer but one should reserve the tables else its always booked especially on weekends. Though we didnt had any reservation we took the drinks and had stood outside and the view it offers is breathtaking :). One can see whole top view of Marina Bay Sands (MBS), esplanade , Singapore eye....... One can click pics while enjoying drinks too. Looking forward to visit again :
5
This was our 2nd visit. We enjoyed the view, the beer and the food very much. We'll definitely come back again.
4
All was very good for a great diner with friends. The view is also fantastic.
The people who are working there are also very nice and give you nice advises...especially the wine :)
3
food is ok, service fine, views are nice
For 33$ set lunch its pretty good but not much more than that.
4
During my two nights trip to Singapore one of the restaurants that we have visited was Level 33 in Marina Bay Financial Center.Level 33 is located on, yes you have guest it on 33rd floor of Tower one. It has it's own express elevator (no stops just ground floor and 33rd floor :)).Restaurant was fully packed during Singapore lunch rush hour at 13h, and was completely empty when we have finished little bit after 14h, with preparations already started for dinner rush hour :). Starters & sweets are served as self service while main course is served by the waiter. Quality of food is fantastic, and balcony provides you with spectacular view over Marina Bay and Marina Bay Send hotel
5
It was great visit to Level33 and the views!!!! you can go and have a dinner there or just to have a drink or two.... venue has excellent view over Marina Bay area and also to the Sands.personnel is super friendly and attentive, crowd of nice people and plus the view.it was great place to bring your friends or just a hang out for drin

I mistakenly booked an indoor seatingand requested for window seat. I didnt get my window seat and was disappointed as I really meant to dine by the marina night view. Fortunately, we were allowed to be put on waiting list and shifted outdoor for dessert dinner. The food was good, beers were good and view is better than that of swissotel or mbs! Be prepared to spend as there is minimum spending for outdoor seats

I usually love this place, the atmosphere and the nicely presented food, hence why I picked it for my colleague's birthday celebration. Knowing lunch time is very busy, I made a booking one week in advance. As the online reservation would only allow 8 pax, I called to adjust it to 10 people and the lady on the phone informed me this change required a $100 deposit to be sent via email. I agreed to it and gave my details.One day later the email still wasn't sent, hence I called again only to be told the email was already sent - I had to ask to send again and I finally received it on the Friday. I sent the email with $100 deposit on the same day and got no reply. Once again I called to follow up, after 3 attempts someone on the line confirmed to have received my deposit. It took some time but hey I had a 10 pax reservation!We arrived at 12:30 today to discover my reservation was cancelled via email on the same morning at 9:40 as they claimed to have never received my deposit.I was quite puzzled, frankly I wasted so much time on this one lunch reservation. I asked why didn't anyone try calling me as they clearly cancelled on me 3 hours prior to my appointment, but this is where it got annoying: they told me they emailed me and called me once and usually that's the procedure. Honestly, for all the trouble I went through for this booking I was expecting a little more help. At that point we were left with the only option of asking if they could still seat us somewhere, as it was 10 of us standing there with no plan B. With quite a high level of disregard, the reception team was not impressed and clearly showed annoyance. They eventually seated us on 2 separate tables and when I noticed 2 close by tables that could have easily welcomed 10 people sitting next to each other, the water did not seem to acknowledge my request and once again reminded me it was my lack of confirmation which made it impossible to help. I truly was speechless by then.After being seated one staff tried to approach me to explain and perhaps also apologize, but by then I was way too offended and frustrated and asked him not to trouble me further.The meal was good as always, no complain on the food besides perhaps the fact that the selection has not changed in one year, but I won't consider level 33 again for large reservations - it is deadly clear they cannot handle them.The worse part was saved for last.While leaving I smiled and said goodbye to that one staff who truly tried to help and whom I was quite unfriendly to - his response was a blank stare back and while I was walking out he pointed at us and obviously started whispering about us with his colleague. Really top notch!I'm in sales and have to deal with unpleasant people all day, yet not once would I allow myself to be impolite nor condescending towards a customer. Positive Customer service is the heart of marketing, what makes people want to come back
4
One of the best places, if not the best, to get an awesome view of MBS and the Marina Bay.Great beer as well as food.Book early for a nice outdoor seating. Or you can come early and maybe you can be lucky to get a seat and keep it for the night. Best to be here before the sunset and see the city with natural light and then see the city lights... simply Awesome!!
4
I celebrated my girl friend birthday at level 33 and tried in house craft brew beers with beer paddle. it was a great experience with the awesome skyview at CBD area. However, the food quality so so only. If you and your friends wish to have chilling places, its recommended to come here, reasonable price for the beers and the view
4
This is an amazing restaurant & You don't have to spend a Kings ransom to enjoy the view. I chose a Beer Paddle which consists of 5 types Blond Lager, IPA, House Porter, Stout and a Wheat Beer. We had tenderloin & a ribeye. What I didn't understand was why my ribeye was not hot when it was served to me. I didn't fuss as it was a romantic dinner and didn't want to spoil the evening. But I was quietly grumbling, that to me spoilt it, me being a steak lover. Side dishes were fresh greens. Dessert was good. All in all, a lovely evening. Service staff was attentive. Yes I'll go back there soon
4
Fantastic views, excellent gastropub fare, decent beer. The outdoor balcony seating is a nice bonus and quite unique.
5
Only went here for drinks one evening but wow the views by night were amazing
I tried the 'Beer Paddle' which consisted of 5 beers from a blonde to a dark which was good value for money
4
On the top,floor of Marina Bay Financial Centre Tower One there is: A craft brewery combined with a restaurant and a lounge. This is Level 33. We went for a late lunch on Sunday. Booking is necessary but because all the offices are closed it is less frenetic than at other times during the week. Sunday is "roast day" and we chose from beef,chicken,pork and lamb. All very English but beautifully cooked and presented. I felt my beef was a bit lacking in portion size compared to the substantial whole chicken and lamb but it was really very good. A glass of house brewed lager (other beers are available) and a bottle of Barossa Valley red helped the meal go down. The views are good across the bay and downtown Singapore. It is expensive but what do you expect in the most expensive city in the world? Our meal for three was just over $400, say Â£200. Staff were helpful and friendly. We'd recommend it
4
We went here on our last night in Singapore and had a very nice experience. We arrived during the peak period which was evident since the place was full inside and out (we did have a reservation). I had requested a table outside however there was no space, the restaurant did however say we would be able to get a table after dinner outside to enjoy the view which was fine with us.We were seated inside and initially it did take a bit of time to get served due to the busy nature of the place. Once we ordered however the food came reasonably quickly and was beautifully presented. In terms of quality the food is good however I wouldnt say its top class. On food\service alone It is very pricey but ultimately you are paying for the views which are fantastic.So, overall experience was a good one, I think the addition of 1 or 2 more waitresses would also have helped this further. - The ones that were working were very pleasant however were clearly very very busy.Would absolutely recommend this place even just for drinks..
4
Visited with gf to celebrated her bday on a Friday night. Through didn't manage to book a table for dinner, their table turn around time was quite fast.manage to get a seat after 20mins of photo taking haha. However, if want a table for drinking, the waiter suggest me to book 1 week in advance
5
This is a review for the bar only as we didn't eat here this time. Despite it being a busy night we found a space out on the viewing deck and were treated to an amazing view of Marina Bay and the East Coast of Singapore. Drinks were decent and priced as you'd expect in the CBD. Due to the location most of the clientele are from the surrounding financial industry so the place can be a bit "Banker-y" but the views more than make up for it! Special mention to the staff who were all very helpful
5
What an amazing find, I would encourage everyone to visit Level 33 while in Singapore. The views are breath taking, this is a great location for photo opportunities and sharing a special moment with loved ones. The cocktails were amazing and beer selection was up there with the best breweries. We did not eat here but the food coming out looked mouth watering. Next visit I will be booking a table to spend the evening eating and drinking the night away while watching the beautiful sunset. Well worth a visit it won't disappoint.
4
As to the view and the breeze ..... WOW. They are also a micro brewery and serve their own selections of beers which are pretty good. Sitting outside is the best but watch the rain in the wet season. The breeze counteract the heat and the view of the bay while sipping a beer (or cocktails) is brilliant .........Food is good but is really limited to snack sized portions so best to mix and match and share.However, the service can be sporadic when the place is busy and you certainly pay a premium. Certainly worth a visit but it will cost
5
Great Food, I had the lamb gnocci and it was fantastic! The beers is also very good. I had the sampler trial pack and I was not disapointed. I would have loved a table outside to get the view on the MBS but there was no table available. I will definately come back and visit again while seated outside
4
Private elevator and stunning views of Singapore's Marina Bay greets you when you get to Level 33. Decor was contemporary and the service was professional. It's a great place for a business lunch or date night given the view. I had the 3-course lunch which was good value, although my choice of fish & chips a tad dry. Buffet Salad made up the disappointment. Would return
5
I went here with friends for having drinks. Nice place to visit with friends. I can see singapore from the restaurant. Their hostess also very nice to welcome us
3
Excellent views and probably worth the visit. The home brewed beer is pretty good, much better than average larger such as tiger etc. The steak was ok but food generally not that good.
5
Fantastic seafood and a very entertaining wine recommendation from our attentive waiter. Excellent venue for visitors to Singapore.
5
Beautiful views of Singapore you can enjoy here in Level 33.
Foods was good and the brewed beer is so delicious to have. Will come again soon!
5
We had dinner here with our daughter visiting from London. We each had a different brew and each thoroughly enjoyed our choice. The food was, without a doubt, some of the best we have eaten in Singapore. The ingredients were very fresh, the dishes delicious with interesting flavour combinations and well-presented. We shared two starters of scallops and of carpaccio of wagyu beef and then went on to ocean trout; venison; and gnocchi with lamb. Each of these dishes was superb. The service was a little slow at the beginning but frankly we enjoyed sitting talking and savouring the craft beer. Often in Singapore we find that service is rushed so this was refreshing. The view from the 33rd floor over Marina Bay is fabulous. A fantastic evening! What's not to like

Walked in and got a table right away for dinner. After seated down, I chose to have some drinks and waited for the other table to finish as there were kids and were noisy.We had couple drinks at the balcony and 2 staff approached if we're still interested to have dinner, I said "yes" but without kids next to my table as they were noisy. Staff could not sympathise with my request until finally a young lady with the name of "Liz" approached us and took out request and she immediately gave us a bar counter table.We placed our orders and served with a round of bread. I did mention to the Waiter that took our order that I would like to have my dinner on the proper dining table where we can sit face-to-face. Waiter seemed to be unhappy to have attended to my requests, and surprisingly there were empty dining tables that we can use and staff was not giving this as they said "we have to prepare for our buffet tomorrow". I was very shocked when I heard that as the message that the staff was giving me was that they cared more about their potential earning for the next day's operation but did not understand the potential revenue they could make on the current operation. The team definitely need MAJOR SERVICE TRAINING.Ms Liz got us a proper dining table and we were enjoying our 3-course dinner.We had scallops and octopus as appetisers which were good. For mains my partner had surf and turf and I had sirloin and both were average, however perfect doneness!Desserts were disastrous, ordered Bavarois and orange sorbet and "The Rhubarb Duo". Imagine having Rhubarb which is a vegetable served as dessert and the worst part it was as Long as an asparagus.Ordered double espresso but only took a sip as the coffee was too acidic and had hints of orange which I don't like.Mr Ming was the Assistant Manager on Duty that had a small chat with us and served with proper wine service for my appetiser and was a pleasant individual. Sadly, wine service was not carried out for my main course as another waitress was serving it.All in all, fantastic view! Need major trainings for staff and worked on concept of it's a bar or restaurant. And with such pricing, we expect service to be there.Only for 2 pax we spent $412. If I were to come back, it's because of the View, Ms is and Mr Ming

Visited Level33 restaurant and micro brewery yesterday. The staff were the slowest ever experienced in Singapore, and one, a man very rude and very unhelpful. We waited ages for our drinks order, and were on the point of walking out. The staff seem to think they are the most important part of this business NOT the customer. Expensive and over hyped, the best thing about this place is the view!!!!!!
4
OK, I cannot rate this as a restaurant since we didn't dine there, but you can go to the terrace and have a drink. Splendid views all round, but especially as the Sun is going down, and the lights are coming on, and the lazer show starts playing on the Marina
5
Booked online for a Friday night early that same day. Great choice as this is a very popular venue after work for MBFC workers. The place has its own micro brewery and you can order a tasting. Otherwise the drinks are a bit pricey but the view across the harbour is worth the expense. Dinner was excellent. Service was unobtrusive but timely. Menu was not large but my steak & lobster at $43 was good value. The risotto was tasty with a large serving. If having dinner enjoy their desert tasting plate. Five magnificent deserts and just enough to share. Will definitely return!
3
I had come to lvl33 many times in the past year. The views of the marina Bay Area and MBS ARE FANTASTIC, and you do not need to pay any fee to go up. Furthermore it is complimented by a decent range of craft beers and wine with some acceptable finger food. The dinner I tried wasn't anything fantastic, and given that those tables do not necessarily put you in a good view, are in my opinion not worth the money.Best seats are outside where there is good wind and views.Highly recommended place for having friends, business associates causal meetings and drinks. Not so much for their sit down foods
4
I visited this restaurant with my friends it was my first time. Here is so nice view. Food and beer are also good.
3
We order a portion of the beef and pork for Sunday lunch. Sunday trimmings were good. However the beef was very tough.. Needs some inprovement
4
Order a Pig & Snail for starters. Portion was a tad small. Mains were Scotland (Medium Rare) and Beef & Reef. Steak was rather ok, but you could have better steaks elsewhere. Restaurant is mainly for the view.
5
One of the best views in Singapore. The food was also delicious. I have gluten intolerance and that was not a problem. Really nice atmosphere.
5
Overall is a fantastic lunch for me and my family . My son love the atmosphere and it's a rare sight too. Hope there is a Valentine dinner next time .
3
Been to Level 33 a few times, the view is stunning especially for out of town guests. But the food is nothing special, quite pricey and drinks are very pricey too. You basically come for the view. This last time we were there around lunch time, were going to order some brunch but they only had the roast option and very limited brunch selection. We ended up ordering a cheese board which was not bad. Good place for drinks but can skip the food
4
Have eaten here twice in the last month both for celebrations. On both occasions the food, service and view have been amazing. Latha did a fantastic job with assisting us to select a delicious 3 course birthday menu. We really appreciated the attentive and special service. It was nice to be remembered for on our second visit
5
First of all the place amazed us with the perfect view to Marina Bay!I was waiting fro my friends and was seated at the open balcony and offered with beer tester of their own brewed beers. We can see the process of the brewing on the monitors which was quite interesting. I preferred their ales.The food was nice. I really liked their meat and cheese platters.After we finished with dinner we continued with beers on the terrace.The staff was quite professional and helpful.Will recommend it for dinner with friends as well with business partners
4
This is a great place to visit, come here often when I have visitors here. The food is great (awesome platters of meats, and nibbles along with full meals). The beer is very fresh and it's great to have a drink and hang out on the terrace with the view. Best to make a reservation so you will not be disappointed, it's hard to get seating on the terrace but you can always keep going out there to see the view (everyone does that). Staff have been very friendly and it has a very nice atmosphere. Good for big groups too they are very accomodative and do a good job with it. This place is a bit pricey but you are paying for the view and you will probably agree it's worth it
4
We went to Level33 with friends for Sunday lunch with their special valentines day menu with wine pairing. The food and the wine selections were excellent (so much so that we bought an extra 3 bottles!).They were also very accommodating when we added two more guests to our booking last minute. I had to pay upfront which wasn't ideal, usually you don't have to do this though on 'normal' days. I will go back and would recommend the restaurant
5
The atmosphere is excellent with nice music and beautiful decorations. An eye opener on beer brewery. Excellent food and beer! It makes my wife birthday celebration a success! Thank you! Looking forward to another visit with my friends! :)
4
Great service with very efficient staffs that respond to customer request very promtly. Very nice atmosphere with great sceneries.
5
You know about the great views from outside on the deck but the food, drinks and service were also top notch.
4
This is my first time being visit in level 33, and we did really enjoyed a panorama view at here. Service was quite good , explain the menu very well make sure you do not have any misunderstanding on the menu, and the service staff helped us to took a few good photograph. And surprisingly, the fine dining served is better than our expectation & price are reasonable
5
my wife & I took our friends here during a break in Singapore to celebrate a birthday - the view from the restaurant is amazing & a fantastic experience. the food and service were both excellent & the "home brew" is pretty good! cocktails were great & shared a T-bone steak which was fantastic (one of the best steaks i have ever eaten). the shared starter platters were perfect (if anything perhaps a bit too big for 2 of them for 4 people). the staff were attentive but not overly so which made for a really nice experience - we enjoyed out desert/coffee out on the balcony for a perfect photo opportunity. Not the cheapest meal i have ever had but worth the extra for the good food, high quality service and the view
1
Awful service. Seated in the corner and left there for twenty minutes without anyone coming over. When I got up myself to order one of their taster paddles they refused saying they were out despite the fact that most tables had them - many of which were already empty. I couldn't be bothered arguing and just left.There was no kind of apology for leaving me for so long, no offer of an alternative or anything. Worst experience I've had anywhere and just totally rude staff all around. Nice view though
5
I took my brother and parents here when they visited, on recommendations from other visiting friends, who said it was a great mix of everything Singapore - views, food and friendly service. And they were right. Pricey, but then no restaurant with billion dollar views isn't. Worth it

We had booked in September last year to have dinner at this restaurant, as part of a 4 week holiday in Australia, with stopover in Singapore. It was my 43rd birthday and after reading good reviews we made a reservation. The day of the booking we were in the neighbourhood and went to see exactly were the restaurant was to ensure we knew where we were going that evening, and confirm our reservation. We had been out in the city and were wearing shorts etc but still looking very respectful, and didn't think anything of it. However, the staff on receiving us at the lift doors thought otherwise. Firstly, they didn't believe we had a reservation as she looked down her noise at us, I showed her my phone and they reluctantly booked us a table even though I had confirmation we already had a table. Then she repeatedly told us that the table went with a $120 spend. Ok we kept saying, knowing this was only Â£60, I mean not exactly expensive! at this point another party arrived for their lunch booking. The receptionist then confirmed our booking with a reminder of the $120 spend, and were we sure that was ok. Never before have I felt so humiliated over a table reservation. If we were young people or looked like backpackers then maybe I could understand her pointing out of this fact, However she could clearly see that we were in our 40's, and $120 isn't exactly a lot of money. We didn't turn up for our booking that evening, which was a shame as I had been looking forward to spending my birthday night there, and lady at the desk, we would have spent a lot more than your $120, as we're going to have a bottle of champagne, but your loss. Maybe you should never judge a book by its cover and don't be so rude to your customers in future, just because we had shorts on. Raffles staff were only to pleased to take our booking that afternoon in our shorts
5
I was expecting you'd just get the view, with the service and food secondary, especially given some of the other reviews, but no! Fantastic food and friendly service, with only a couple of issues (so really 4.5, see later). We arrived early to have a drink and enjoy the view and were ushered to a reserved table for a quick drink. We then had steak and sides which were REALLY good. It was expensive, which I know Singapore is, but living in Hong Kong I thought I'd be used to the prices. Only downside; toilets really messy and needed a clean (no difference between visits at the end and start of meal) and the service did take a while to get going ... we had to keep asking for bread, more water and the wine list
5
Invited to a business function, I was thorougly impressed with LeVel 33 at the Marina Bay Financial Center. The views are very hard to beat, and the food is very tasty. The whole atmosphere is definitively "urban chique" - but in a very laid back and welcoming way with a great selection of beers, wines and spirits as well as great service provided. For a relaxed evening for drinks with friends or business partners - but also for an impressive dinner with a great view: this place is rocks both! Certainly will be back, and definitively a place not to miss out on
4
Decent selection of their own brews, great for after work or business or tourists with great view of MBS and the city.
3
Great location with stunning views. Impressive layout and good beers. Good menu for full meals and bar snacks. Not enough staff leading to poor service.
4
Really like this place for its view..
Often go here to enjoy the view..
But, this place remains to be very crowded, no chairs at times makes uncomfortable to stand for long time..
Best for people who are new to Singapore
4
A sky-high brewery which serves really nice food. It's great to enjoy dinner and look out to the Singapore skyline. They have a great choice of food, and everything we had tasted great. And of course, many beers to choose from. It is a fancy restaurant so it's a bit expensive, but the quality is there, and you can also just sit at the bar and order finger food. We've been twice already and will be back again
5
Arranged a birthday party there, the service was great and we really enjoyed ourselves, they even moved us to an outside view once the restaurant was less packed. She will happy, and to me it was a great success for dinner. The only issue is that the single lift does take pretty longtime to arrive (1-33 floors) Go check it out
4
To be fair, I probably can't comment on the value of the food here as I was treated to lunch by a colleague. And, neither of us ordered anything exotic. I ordered fish and chips and my colleague ordered a burger. The food took a bit of time to arrive (though the place was quite empty) but came piping hot. My dish was quite decent, the fish seemed fresh and the serving was just right for a working lunch. It was also quiet enough so one could talk peacefully. The only downside is that the service kept disappearing for stretches of time, though since we rarely needed anything this was just a minor annoyance. My colleagues frequently come here for drinks and the view from the balcony at night time is very nice although the view from the top of the OUE Bayfront building is far more glamorous as it directly looks onto the Esplanade and Marina Bay, some of which is partially blocked from Level 33's view by the other corporate buildings in the CBD. All in all, a pretty good place for a weekday lunch. Probably not cheap enough to be an everyday visit but certainly doable 3-4 times a month

Alcohol does not come cheap in Singapore so when you pay big bucks you better get something for return and that is why you should go to LeVel33. Craft beer and nice view! We had the brunch which was pretty good....it even came with free flow foie gras

I went to Bar on last Wednesday to celebrate my birthday I requested for terrace seat to Amelia so she said she will put my name on the waiting list however, she never get back to us so when we checked with another staff we found out that there was not our name on the waiting list later, when we would have a cake which brought from out side she came to us and informed us that we should pay 15 $ as there is additional fee for outside food we totally understand if we should pay for that but way she informed us was really rude eventually, we could not have a table outside.When I asked the staff whether can borrow lighter staff asked me to go smoking area when I asked for bill they asked me to go counter to settle the billAll I experienced there was self service haha on my birthday I did not even expect to have special birthday service but it was really worse than just service.Ambiance and view are really nice however, the staff should be changed as they are not willing to serve guest well

At 33 stories high, the view of the bay and its surroundings is quite spectacular, particularly at night. Food is of excellent quality. It's always busy so need to book. Service is generally not fast, but very responsive when asked. Prices a little high. Great range of beers
4
We booked an outside terrace table, weeks before arrival. They put you through the hoops, wanting you to agree to spend a certain amount! I can understand that, but what I can't understand is as soon as you sit down to order, they want to take your credit card away, for the duration of the stay! Now in this day and age of card skimming etc, we were uncomfortable with that, but had no choice!The beer was great, the food average pub quality. The nighttime view is a never to forget event. What peeved us off though, were people who must come up for one drink and come out to the terrace, crowd in beside your table to admire the view. Don't mind the occasional snapper, but when 4 people turn up, drinks in hand and stand between your table and the view, crowding your personal space and intruding on your dinner conversation, then enough's, enough! I complained to management who were turning a blind eye to the practice, and the people were asked to move
5
Convenience of using chope to make this booking a Breeze is amplified the the Actual character of the level33. The views are amazing, service level is good and the food is pretty good too! Just wish they had a few more options though
5
There is a fantastic experience to have dinner at restaurant Level 33 with wonderful scene, delicious foods and drinks, friendly service and comfort dining atmosphere. Highly recommended to enjoying the experience there!
3
I went there 3-4 times for the outdoor. Love the view but there wasn't a lot of seat. You might want to try to book for table before you go. Beer is great
2
Went there with some friends on a short visit to Singapore. Service was terrible. We left with a terrible experience. Although the view is excellent, all is ruined by the service.
4
Thank you for the successful surprise for my bestfriend! She really had a memorable 21st! 😊
Even though the waiting time was pretty long but, its delicious and the atmosphere was fabulous! ✌👍
3
My sis-in-law recommended us this place for dinner and we enjoyed the atmosphere and the food..it would be great if the waitress can recommend us some of the dishes or tell us more about it. The only setback, we don't really feel welcome at the reception and this is certainly not a good customer service. Overall, the view is awesome and the food is delicious.
4
Been here many times already and it never fails to impress. Try the beer tasting (5 pieces) to go with whatever you eat. The cocoa (chocolate fondant) is a must to finish off. We all had different starters and main courses and I won't mention them all here but everything was fine. You also get some bread while you're waiting which is definitely not standard in Singapore, so a nice touch as well. Love this place and the view of Marina Bay Sands is amazing. Get a table outside if you like eating outside because the view is really great
4
Was trying to book online but it shows N/A, was calling the restaurant a few times, but always directed to answering, on my fifth attempt finally I was able to speak to someone and made the dinner reservation. Some waiter were very attentive but others were not welcoming, needs to work on body language and service standards for consistency. Waitress was pouring water on my glass while talking to her colleague from the other table with a loud voice. Food, cocktails and view was amazing but staff needs more polishing to create a better dining experience.
4
I normally go to Level 33 for the executive lunch and take clients or my own team there with me. The starter and dessert buffets are always good and have a nice selection of salads and cold meats to choose from. I particularly like the prawns. My colleague's main was the squid ink linguine. Unfortunately it was a bit doughey this time round. My steak was good, cooked nicely and served with some vegetables - quite enjoyable
1
Went to LVL33 for the Sunday roast, late lunchtime, which I tried before. Off the 5 items on the Sunday roast menu, only 2 items were avail, fish and beef. I find it a bit poor that several items were missing which also came as a surprise to the waiter. All and all, go there for the view as no guarantee they have any food from the menu avail.
5
Please see Yelp for review and pictures!
We particularly love the environment and foei gras! Price is reasonable.
4
We spent our last night in Singapore at a window side table at this very good gastropub. The microbrewery turns out very good beers and the food, while pricey, is excellent with generous servings - big enough to share in many cases. Book a table to assure a seat - on a nice evening there's the option of an outdoor highboy table if you wish. The views from this rooftop location are spectacular, especially as the lights of the city come on at sundown. It's very popular with the after work crowd, so do make a reservation.
5
This place, other than serving own made beers (lager, ale, stout and others) it's perfect for a drink during the sunset. It overlooks alla the Marina Bay Area and has a stunning view over the straits that separates Singapore from Indonesia.Don't miss the lookout over the "Garden Rapsody" that start at 8 pm at Garden By the bay, just 120 meters beneath the balcony where a cool brezze makes the visit to Level 33 a very nice experience
5
Went with my wife,daughter and son in law and grandson (1) at lunchtime for the set menu @ $33....starters were laid out buffet style ...choice of salads,cheeses ,cold meats etc were great...the prawns were top drawer.My main course was fish done in their own beer batter....fish was rather large and the batter was brilliant...stayed crisp all the time as I struggled to finish my meal..really tasty! There were a choice of various cakes ,melons,fruits etc for dessert.I had a pint of their own brewed lager which was really nice and after decided to have their brew of the season...a lovely beer.We all enjoyed our meals...the hamburger my daughter ordered was immense..service I found to be professional and welcoming.It was very busy - I would say mostly people from the financial and business quarter.Thoroughly enjoyed it
4
Went on a Thursday night and seemed to be full of business suits entertaining. Tables inside really no view. Shared a seafood platter (bout $60) that included open can of anchovies and other very rich fish such as mackerel and sardines. Was ok. The staff were attentive and efficient. Mango beer was great. Wouldn't bother going again
3
Nice spot, great view of Marina Bay. Friendly service but not brilliant (drinks not delivered, mix up with Bill). Out of a party of 4 two were happy with the food but two were not. Drinks were good and some of the craft beers were actually pretty good. Main gripe however were the portion sizes. With three starters and four mains we should have not have been hungry afterwards. Sgd 450 cost. If they increased the portions this would get a four rating
2
Great view and nice food when it eventually arrived after waiting for an hour. Service is inattentive. This restaurant doesn't know what it wants to be: a gastropub or nouveau cuisine? Portions are small and lack flavour. As a microbrewery they should be able to pour beer without a quarter of the glass being froth, and beer served that is flat.
4
I eat here for a business meeting. Unique to have a brewery (highest brewery in the world lol) and view of the whole Marina bay.The food was nice massive ploughmans platter to share was very filling for two people. Actually larger than our mains.The beer was great.Whilst it is not a cheap place for business I recommend as it gives you a different setting than a standard restaurant and conversation flows.Also nice to have drinks and bar snacks on the balcony
4
If you are looking for a dinner out that's a bit more special than your local food court, the level33 definitely offers a beautiful view over the Bay as well as some delicious food & drinks. Their lunches are also particularly handy for client/business style settings offering a buffet style starter and dessert with set main for a relatively reasonable price per head (>$50 with tax and service).Would recommend for the vue (for guests or clients) and for those enjoying a house brewed pint of beer/ale
2
I was quiet flattered. An iPad! This is advanced. Do I need to give a sample of sorts? Was this to be my first Artificially Intelligent Meal? Would they be guessing what my body really wants? Was it going to choose my girlfriends meal for her? That would save time. What an experience! Why didnâ€™t I know about this. After a few "small glitches" I fell back to earth and started to wonder if perhaps LeVel 33 was sacrificing practicality and efficiency to merely look... advanced. What was wrong with the old 'pen and paper' or even just good ol' human brain. My question was soon answered when we asked to be seated outside. The staff just about used the onboard GPS to get to and from tables and explain the complicated rules. Rules you say!? Yes everything from what time to what time certain menus are available to what menu you cannot order from when seated in certain areas, to where you can be seen after certain hours. It was a nightmare it felt like this was some sort of privilege and we were lucky to be invited in.Our order was simple (since we were sitting outside before the bigger menu was available at 7 pm) yet it took the waitress 2 minutes to locate the item on the iPad. We also asked for extra bread. We were told we cannot order extra bread, another table had extra bread. We said we just want what they have. We found out that they had a "break basket", okay 1 "bread basket" then please. I could continue to regurgitate stories but it remains that LeVel 33 has a monopoly on the "view and beer combo". So regardless of the level of service and common sense offered by the staff, crowds will still flock to LeVel 33. Just be sure you know the seating rules and menu schedule to avoid disappointment
3
This restaurant and Brewery offers great view at almost eye level. The roast beef is good but overall the price is on the high end. Nice place to chill out at the Alfresco area.
5
I went LeveL33 with my mother, she was the first time to go abroad!
And the day when we went there, the nightscape was fantastic and the dishes were nice!( cooking shrimps and some special noodle, I recommend! )
4
Loved the view, the food and the service. Level 33 offers a unique eating and drinking experience in a spectacular city. I shall certainly be recommending Level 33 Singapore
2
The staff attended my table seemed to be just an auntie clearing tables(?) who had absolutely no idea of menu / food being served.
4
- Advertised as Singapore's tallest microbrewery.
- Their range of craft beers is organized by number, with helpful pairing suggestions.
- Food and service are great.
- Wonderful evening view of the Marina Bay aea.
5
yes... i already enter in level 33 restoran felt great beautiful... 100% best.. i eat in level 33 rich best.. beautiful...
5
By all means visit Level33 for a drink and take in the spectacular view of Marina Bay and the architecture surrounding it; Lunch time sets are good and include small salad and dessert bar. However, the service leaves something to be desired - to have no expectations. Management and Staff need to "up their game" to survive the competitive market - microbrewery or not
2
We took my family there because 1 Altitude was closed due to weather and they wanted to have a nice view of the city skyline before flying back to South Africa.There are so many problems here. Firstly, the waiters are extremely rude and really unfriendly. Apparently you are not allowed to move tables together in the smoking section. You can take all the chairs that are available but you have to sit around only one small square table. This is ridiculous. Secondly, when a waiter thinks that they are clever by repeating everything you are saying in a conversation to your husband I would say that this is rude and just plain unprofessional.With this bad service and the drinks being so overpriced ($19++ for a small glass of horrible rose wine) I definitely think that they need a lot of work. It was embarrassing bringing our family visiting from SA there. The beer was also not great at all.Only thing it has going for it is the view
4
I've been to Level 33 thrice and it's a different experience each time. The view is always amazing so be sure to get a table outside. If you're going in the afternoon but want to enjoy the view, get a cold drink ASAP because it gets hot out there. If you can't decide what to order, go for the beer sampler. The place fills up at night so make a reservation. Seeing MBS and the rest of the city lit up at night is a sight that shouldn't be missed
4
We had a company function here. It was lovely to drink a few of their in house brewed beers and enjoy the fantastic view over. Singapore from their balcony. The food was excellent and generous. We had sharing platters for starters, followed by beef and a slow braised lamb which you carved yourself at the table. The accompanying wines were e excellent.I will definitely come back with the family.
5
We spent news years eve here and loved it. The beer was great and the wait staff really friendly and the food was delicious although European not Asian.
5
Really enjoyed our time. Food quality can be improved very slightly but still worth the money.
Recommended by friends and I will recommend to someone else, definitely.
4
The ambience is nice. Great view from the restaurant. The 2 choices of dessert recommended by the waitress are superb.
5
Great View of the bay, but the thing which will bring me here again will be the BEER, an awesome place to hangout !!
5
I imagine that many places in Singapore would have fantastic views, but this was the only rooftop experience that I had while I was there and it was amazing. I would recommend going at about 6-8pm like we did so that you can see the bay in the daylight and nighttime. It was so clear we could see Malaysia and Indonesia. It's expensive - $23 for a cocktail, but it was a lovely kumquat cocktail and that's not actually that much more than Australian prices anyway... I thought it was worth it for the view
5
This bar is well worth the exercise of trying to find it. Located on the 33rd floor looking over Marina Bay the views are superb. With a great range of craft beers, spirits and good food it makes for a great evening out as a couple or with friends
5
I had booked dinner at Level 33 for our 20 th wedding anniversary and was not disappointed. I had emailed the restaurant to enquire about getting a good table with a view, they replied promptly and stated they would do their best to accomodate.On arriving, they wished us a happy anniversary and we were giving a great table with fantastic views, after our meal, our waitress led us outside to a table on the balcony that they ha d reserved for us. The views of Singapore at night from the restaurant are brilliant. As for the food food, we thoroughly enjoyed it, the starters were tasty ( hubby had scallops and I had the soup). For mains we had the pork and the cod with sides of duck fat roasted kipflers and spinach and enjoyed every tasty bite. If I had one criticism, it would be that kipfler potatoes don't lend themselves to duck fast roasting, you really need a good floury potato to get that duck fat roasted crunch, they were tasty nonetheless. The staff were attentive and very helpful and friendly, the food good and the views fantastic
3
This place is well worth a visit for the view, especially at twilight.The beer is overpriced, to be expected, and is just average. Same goes for the food. The service was even worse.Having said all that, I'd still recommend it for the view alone
5
We lived in Singapore for 4 years and this is still my Number 1 restaurant. The world's highest Urban Craft Brewery. It's more that a restaurant, it's an experience. I went there 5 times and without fail came away feeling special. From the moment you arrive and enter the private Level 33 lift to the reception, walking in past the copper beer chambers and the entry to the restaurant. Very special. One of the best views in the world and the food and beer is simply 5 star. The ultimate is the Executive Set Lunch (only served Monday to Fridays). A Five Star appetiser buffet and a choice of Main Course. The beers are also out of this world. Take a break from your food and step out on the large balcony. Best view in Singapore. Took many friends and family there and the memories will stay with us forever
5
I love these place so much. I'm a regular patron of level 33. Will always introduce my local or overseas friends to these place to unwind and destress. Great place and Great view at an affordable price. Especially the beers. Delicious finger foods to go along with the beers. Highly recommended !!
4
The views of the Marina financial centre are great. We had the pig and snail as appetiser, and shared the t-loin steak for two.
4
You get a great view on Marina Bay but the place is a bit crowded. Therefore a reservation on the terrace is highly recommended.
4
It's nice place to see MBS but food is not really great. If you only care about view it's definitely good place
4
however, the taste of the starter (some kind if soup with beer) that we have ordered is horrible. i think they should take it out from the menu. the view is fantastic anyways.
5
It has Very Good View and Very Kind Staff. Also, It has Very Delicious Food and flavored beer. I had a good time in Level33.
4
Main courses dining. Not bad the lamb to be shared for 3. Nice puddle beer to try each kind.
The great view itself can justify a little of overprice!
5
This was my second time in Level33 within 2 months!The foods were great! The view is definitely awesome and last but not least, the waitress- they are extremely friendly and helpful! The only thing that i regret the most is the dessert, do not really any signature/ tasty dessert for both of my visits. but anyway, I will definitely be there again!
5
Weekday Lunch buffet at $33 per pax includes appetizer and dessert buffet and one mains. Fresh ingredients. Good food. Reservations required especially if u want a table by the window. Alternatively u can go up for drinks only. Outdoor area provides paranomic view of marina bay area
3
The view is definitely amazing - you get a panaroma of MBS, the big Durians and the whole CBD area along the Singapore river. The food and drinks are good quality too but pricey. The gambas are huge and garlicey delicious. Beef cubes are tender juicy and tasty too. Kale chips are a bit oily. Bread with the truffle hummus dips, eggplant dips are indulgent. Pumpkin pale ale is my all time fav. Oh did I mention their beer tasting flight? You cannot miss that
5
Service was good and staffs were friendly. We were there for Executive Lunch set and was impress with the semi buffet spread. My main course Risotto was not bad and my friend's Lamb steak was nice just a little too much tendon. The evening view should be more spectacular.
4
Nice environment, good food. Service was acceptable but not outstanding. May consider holding my wedding reception here next year!
5
Great place to hang out with colleagues. Spectacular view of Singapore skyline. Enjoyed my time here. A must trip visiting business Center
4
LeVel 33 has fantastic view of Marina Bay and the surroundings. You can have Happy Hour here which is reasonable in price. Food is also of high quality
2
Unfortunately they had troubles to find my reservation. Food Quality was average, the meat was not really tasteful, kind of warmed up. The Highlight is the Panorama View on Marina Bay, this is also reflected in the rather high pricing for food and drinks.
4
Great microbrewery restaurant with super view over Marina bay - try the selection of beers. Good for business lunch
3
With so many amazing roof top bars to choose from you need to have great service as well as views. Unfortunately when we went it took us over 30 minutes to place our drink order and the staff acted as though we were inconveniencing them when we asked to order! The drinks were good, they brew their own beers on site, and I enjoyed sitting on the balcony watching the view of marina bay. However I wouldn't rush back especially as they took our credit card when we ordered but when we were leaving we paid cash and they didn't return the card. Due to our taxi having arrived we didn't remember that we had given them the card until we we were already on our way! I know we should have remembered to ask but good service would have been to return it when we paid cash.
4
There's no shortage of rooftop bars in Singapore, but LeVeL 33 is still a relatively well kept secret with the best views of Marina Bay and no cover charge. I wouldn't hesitate to bring overseas visitors here for lunch or drinks after work. The open air balcony is closed in extreme wind or rain, and you'll also want to avoid it on extremely sunny days, but on a relatively cool day with a few clouds it is perfect
5
We were very lucky to be brought here by friends who are regulars so had great corner table outside with stupendous night -time views of the bay! The beer paddle is excellent not to mention the so cute serving of Hendricks g&t!! Had bar menu with lots of sharing platters - good choice. Would recommend highly for great ambience.
4
Everyone one knows the Marina Bay View from the well known Marina Bay Sands (that kind of ship in the air with a huge swimming pool) but I must say I like to view from LeveL33 much more.The atmosphere is great, it has space and the prices are not that insane as at MBS.It's the highest microbrewery in Singapore and worth paying a visit. You can get there by MRT, take to downtown line to downtown and follow the signs to Marina Bay Financial Centre tower 1.Oh and don't forget to order the easing Paddle once you're there
5
World's highest craft brewery! Great selection and tasting paddle is great fun.The view is to die for - catch the laser show over Marina Bay from high up and no need to pay for a cover charge and its an unrestricted view.Didn't dine at the restaurant but sat outside on the balcony and there are no faults. Bar food menu has a good selection
3
Former beer brewery, which brings a great environment with it. Nice location to take a drink and a bite; prices according to Singapore tourism standards though!
4
good environment , services and food for dining . It's best choice for couple , friends dining here .
5
I go to this restaurant with friends that visit me in Singapore. The food is good, a huge variation on drinks and ok service. But the most important reason is the view on Marina bay and the fact that you can sit outside and smoke while you're drinking your fancy drink. Always good for a perfect picture with a nice skyline on the background
3
I was expecting more from this place. My main issue is that its beer is decidedly average. Yes it has a good view of Marina Bay Sands etc. but at the end of the day, its the food and drink that makes a place. As it's a microbrewery I was expecting to taste some good beer. Myself and my friends got the sampler set and none of what we drank really impressed. All were pretty bland tasting to be honest. Probably wouldn't go back. There are better Microbreweries in town
1
We went for a christmans dinner with around 16 people and had a dinner set pre-ordered for around 100$ per person (without drinks). The starters were completely tasteless (beetroot with ruccola - without any seasoning or dressing, the Wagyu carpaccio appearently was put into water for some hours and sliced too thick) the main dishes not fresh (codfish) or overcooked (beef) and the deserts came with artifical flavour (mint chocolate mousse). We found one fly in the salad and were told by the waitress that this is because they use organic salad! Not really professional - the rest of the service was quite o.k. but not bothering that nobody at our big table actually was enjoying at all the food. Based on this experience I can only recommend this place for having some beers (which are good) on the balcony with a fantastic view on MBS but better not eat there
3
Lotsa buzz. Beautiful copper fermentation tanks. There's the view for awhile until the reserved tables arrive. Mostly it's an after-hours swanky spot for the CBD crowd. For family with teens and vegetarians there isn't much to offer after the excitement of riding the exclusive zoomy lift to the 33rd floor
5
Level 33 as the name says its on top of the MBFC building pretty much walk-able from the down town station or from raffles station very easy to get there from a cab. Choose to sit outside to enjoy the view. Excellent menu and very good selection of wines.
3
Slick operation although the views are only available from the terrace (as opposed to the bar and restaurant). Terrace was crowded on the evening I was there. Views are not 360 degrees and are partially restricted by pillars. Better city wide views are available from Dunston Pinnacle in Tanjong Pagar. Beer is good but was 17SPD a pint even at 'happy hour' and I had to ask for my pint to be topped up. Didn't eat so can't comment on the food. Worthwhile but not essential
3
Since we were there after 10 pm, we could only order from the beer dining menu, which had quite a few substantial choices of the usual sliders, chicken wing, lamb & beef short rib small plates. Although it was a Thursday night, there were no tables available outside and we were put on a waiting list. There is no reservation for tables outside thus making it not a very efficient system because diners find themselves having a meal indoors and having to move out in mid-meal when one becomes available. In any case, when we eventually ventured out, we didn't find the vista and views of the Marina Bay Sands area that panoramic or spectacular only because the views are not unobstructed as what most people seem to say. It is in fact, blocked by the balcony's very own floor to ceiling pillars which happen every few tables apart. The balcony itself is a narrow strip and actually felt claustrophobic. We have been to a few other restaurants and rooftop bars where the view is truly unobstructed with everything laid out right before your eyes in one glance (Aura Skybar and Lounge for one, though it is not elevated much).The food was mediocre bar grub, the fries were too thick and fat and came soggy. Service, though not rude at all, bordered on being boisterous and came with a slight in-your-face loudness and roughness. And the setting and decor - if it was going for the industrial look, it did not meet expectations. Instead, we found the floor an uncool cemented base, the wooden tables and chairs looking worn and basic. All fine if prices matched. But they did not
4
Gorgeous venue, amazing view and a breathtaking place to enjoy a meal or drink. Enjoyed a wonderful dinner here with friends, the view out overlooking the MBS, Singapore Flyer and the harbor is just gorgeous. If you can sit outside for a light meal or a drink after your main meal inside take the opportunity to do so it is well worth it. The food was very good, decent sized portions, some menu items seamed overpriced but others were not so if you are budget conscious there would be something on the menu you could select, or if not you could go all out with an expensive Japanese steak. Drinks options were great with craft beer, craft beer cocktails and regular cocktails. All good quality and well made. Cocktails would be considered on the expensive side at around $28 but your paying for the view really. A bit hard to find if you don't know where you are going, in the financial district with little signage but so worth the effort. The only let down was the poor service. Took a long time to order, drinks were forgotten, water never arrived, bill didn't arrive after being requested, constantly having to get up and approach the staff to follow up on things.
4
If there is one place you must visit on you visit to Singapore this is it. Preferably at night LeVel 33 will give you the views of Singapore that will live with you for years afterwards.
5
Loved my second lunch here. Cool vibes, attentive service and amazing views over Marina Bay. The food and wine selections were satisfying.
4
If you like craft beer you should definitely check out this place. Order the beer tasting paddle to try 5 100mL glasses of their core range of beers. It is a little expensive, but it has a good atmosphere, and the view is spectacular!
5
The view alone is worth it. There is an easily met minimum per person to reserve a seat outside, but it makes the trip. Try to book a table at sunset.
4
Perfect place for an outdoor craft beer for such alluring sun set on an elevated height. You can see the entire Marina Bay including the iconic MBS without turning your head. Certain timing of the evening you get to enjoy laser display from the hotel just in front of you. This place brews its own craft beer and serves a good selection of bar bites that don't come with an exorbitant price, typically less than $20 each. There's indoor dining but it defeats the purpose of coming here. A really nice chillout
3
Beer is thumb up!Service was bad. There's 3 of us, we were only given 2 iced water. Ask for water refill for 3 times before it was finally refilled. The bill took so long I had to ask for 3 times before they send it to us. Servers are more keen to serve ang moh than us.
4
There is nothing like sitting on top of the world and experiencing a great meal. We were told the best place for a Sunday roast was at Level 33 and we were not disappointed, a great choice for everyone and the food was excellent. the only issue was the very slow service which is fine when you are relaxing and have ordered but it was to order. But all in all a great Sunday roast
3
I have been to the restaurant a few times and think the venue and quality is very good, but this time I was dissapointed of the service. We were a party of 8 at a business dinner (7 men and one woman) and by accident one of the waiters by accident spilled a whole glass of lime juice on our female guest, it was not a drop or two but the whole glass from the head and down. These thing can happen, but it was not handled very well by the staff. The waiter off course apologized and came with some tissues, but the night was ruined for our guest that left shortly after she had finished her food (which was only served after to failed attempts to gove her pork - she ordered cod). I feel that the least that could be offered was a cleaning of the dress, handbag, etc and then I would actually expect some sort of compensation. It does not have to be much, but a token of apology would have been welcome and could have lifted the spirit in the group. After complaining we did get a compensation and one the way out the floor manager offered us his business card and offered to buy us a free beer at the next visit (like he remembers that) but it was to little to late to take away the bad experience.
3
The restaurant is on 33rd level at DBS Bank, Marina Bay.Standard foods taste, but it has a nice view. We can see a whole parts of Marina Bay area, at night the view will be more georgeous !If u looking for restaurant with a nice view, you must visit there
4
Located in Tower 1 of the Marina Bay financial centre.. There's a specific lift that only goes up to level 33, once you reach the main lobby of tower 1 there is a signage pointing to the lift so it's pretty easy to navigate. Simply enter the lift and it will scoot you straight up to LeVeL 33. There are indoor table seating for those who wishes to dine and outdoor standing area for those who just want a drink and admire the good view. Good for chilling over a drink after work or bring your special someone and surprise them. Pretty chill and relax and it's definitely a hidden find! Will be back to try the mains from the menu soon.
5
I and my guests enjoed nice drinks, nice view and food. LeVel33 has a great value for money. I'll go there again for sure.
5
The venue is great and the beer is also excellent. The views over the bay are gorgeous and we would recommend getting a table outside for sunset as it is absolutely gorgeous!

Beer sampler is good on shape and test. but it was not subject to early bird discount.
After finishing dish, we were escorted to a table outside and enjoyed much better view with an extra glass.
5
From service to food to drinks to view. The best. My partner enjoyed it very much because it was her bday.
4
Love the buffet salad and desert bar that comes with main ala carte menu. Mains are good sized and service good. Best to reserve and not just show up during lunch.
5
Wonderful dinner with my girlfriend and the Pumpkin Ale is a recommended beer to have. Nice environment however it was drizzling a bit nevertheless good place to enjoy a Friday evening
3
Went for Sat buffet brunch. Food quality was excellent but just too salty for my liking. Would be better if brunch selection took into consideration having a good mix for different palette. Empy plates were cleared up fast. Service could do better with a smile.
4
Great place to visit for a drink.
Thoroughly recommend the beer tasting palate - 5 tasty beers to try overlooking the Marina - top spot!
3
Went up after dinner mainly for drinks and the view. There was a queue to get up as well as a minimum charge which included only one drink. That meant the one drink was quite expensive but where in Singapore are drinks cheap. It was quite busy with people and there was a live band playing. The views were incredible but for me the music was a little loud however the younger folks were obviously happy with everything. Very happy I went and my son and his friend carried on long after I left and got a can back to the hotel
5
My husband and I were pleased with the impeccable service along with the fine food and ambience of the place. The beer tasting paddle allows one to try the various in-house brews at a reasonable rate. LeVel33 is an ideal place to dine at for those special occasions. 
5
The lunch was great and value for money. Had an enjoyable time with colleagues. The set menu choices were limited and majority was beef. Had the fish and chips, which was very nice.
5
It's suited to lovers.
I also like the beer, it's wonderful!
I will coming again with my friends at next time!
5
This is a real cool place to meet up with friends and share a bottle of fizz!!
The views are spectacular and there is a really nice vibe to the place. Definitely worth a visit if you are in Singapore!!
4
First time at this place, it is definitely spendy and not the kind of place where you can afford to go very often but the view and atmosphere is so cool that it is worth it for special occasions or date night.
4
A visit here was purely for the incredible view and some drinks. Service is friendly and attentive and the view is unparalled. Definitely worth a visit.
5
What a find in the Financial Center, way up on the 33rd floor!! Who would have thought you would find a craft brewery so high up in a tower, but there it was. We were there on a Monday night, was a little crowded with the after work crowd, but thinned out by around 9. Fantastic views back toward Marina Sands, you can watch the light show and pay half the price of being at the Fullerton or on top of Marina Sands itself. The beers are well crafted, with plenty of choice, as well as a very extensive wine and cocktail list. Bar also serves meals which we didn't try but looked very tasty!! One of the best bars to visit while you are in Singapore
5
When visitors ask me for a recommendation in Singapore, I always recommend Level 33, and none have been disappointed. The view is one of the best in Singapore, yet the prices are more reasonable than other view restaurants. It is not easy to find good beer in Singapore, and Level 33 serves a good selection of flavorful microbrews. The food is western style and pretty decent
4
This restaurant was recommended to us and it didn't disappoint. Our meals were excellent as were the beers on offer from the microbrewery. We initially had a table inside but towards the end of our meal we asked for a balcony table so that we could watch the nightly light show over the marina. This was well worth it as the view over Singapore is spectacular
3
Popped in to test the beer and see view. Was Saturday midday so only available food was brunch menu ($56 or $96 with drinks)-we didn't do either as only wanted small bite-boo. But we had beer. Hubby enjoys beer, not into full flavour but said even he found them bland. He did tasting paddle. If you're a beer connoisseur then maybe make wide berth. Views to die for tho...brunch seemed popular
5
Whether here for a drink, bar snack or full Restuarant food this is a great place. It can be very busy however if you can get in the food and beer is great! The view is also amazing! It's quite expensive but because it's good you feel it's good value. A great evening out!
5
Food, view and service all outstanding! A definite must do for visitors. The Blonde Lager also goes well.
4
We ordered the beer paddle for beer testing, the Lager, house porter & strout are the favorite! Great!
4
Sitting outside is really a joy, quiet and easy to have a conversation and the view is magnificent. They serve almost everything in drinks but are most famous for the home brewed beer of different sorts.
4
This popular restaurant has a wonderful view of the inner lake of Singapore. The food is good but not wonderful for the price you pay here. Interesting 5 different beer tastes of 0.1L to try!
5
Very nice food and view you can see Singapore river. You had better go there after 7PM for enjoing view.
5
Great lively bar with amazing views of the harbor area. The staff were helpful and accommodating. Prices were inline with the area and food (snacks) were prepared well and flavorful. I would go to this bar just for the food and atmosphere again.
5
4 of us visited LeVel33 for dinner.The reservations were in order.The table was in order.Mr Anthony Raj served us.When we were done, we felt great about our dinner experience.LeVel33 already had it's location going for them.At the 33rd floor, with it's balcony facing Marina Bay Sands Hotel/Casino on the right and Shenton Way (business district) on the left, patrons would already give high marks to the night view.Much of our pleasant experience was contributed by Anthony, who served us.Anthony, in our view, created that premium, that difference.Hardware (eg infrastructure) is important & count.But heartware is what makes ar breaks a customer's experience."Heartware" being service - a huge "product" differentiator.He made us feel comfortable in our own skins.He made light banter in appropriate situations so we were at ease to order our food,His joking & relaxed demeanour breaks the ice and keeps the dinner ambience fresh and "active".When we were seated inside for dinner..Anthony was observant about us.He'd come over when we were ready to order.As it was our 1st time, Anthony provided useful recommendations to assist, from drink to starters, to Main & Dessert.All 4 of us felt good throughout dinner.When we ordered dessert, Anthony was already thinking ahead of our desire to seat ourselves at the open balcony.He arranged for an available table for us, so we could just smoothly "float over" from inside the restaurant to the balcony, as soon as we were done with our dessert.At the balcony, we enjoyed the Great Views that patrons commonly talk about.The occasional light show by MBS as viewed from LeVel33 is "awesome to the max".If ever one is in Singapore and looking for a restaurant with a view, LeVel33 would be my 1st confident choice.I dare say LeVel33 beats other "restaurants-with-a-view-that-turn-360degrees", hands down.Worth a repeat visit ... no doubt about that
3
Level 33 is probably the most famous microbrewery in Singapore. This is probably more due to the amazing view (Raffles, MBS, the flyer, gardens by the bay) that you get. I strongly recommend coming here at night as opposed to during the day. The view is just that much better.That said, as a microbrewery the place is probably the least impressive in Singapore. All of its brews are fairly bland with little character. Especially the blonde lager and wheat are weak efforts. If you do want to sample what's on tap, the stout is airy and drinkable with a decent coffee kick, the IPA is doable even if it's not a very balanced brew. It would humble the place to serve some bottled crafts like most other places do, but they might sell faster than the home brews.Can't comment on the food, never bothered. The service is friendly although you can expect staff to take a good while to get you seated
5
Ambience is gd with a nice view .. it has a big private lift so no need to wait very long for it.. food portion is quite big .. n its very yummy .. salad bar has very fresh fruits n yummy cakes .. quality is gd .. should try their beef sandwich its great .. service was great .. cleaned our table after we ate bread coz of the crumps .. refill ice water very quickly .. clear plates fast .. very attentive n these are done during peak hours .. lunch time .. price wise i would say its worth wat you are paying for .. set lunch for 2 pax (includes free flow salad bar) is abt $70 include svc charge n gst ..
5
Great way to finish a hectic day. Sit back relax, enjoy a cool drink and take in the wonderful vista.At 8.45pm there is a stunning light show from Marina Bay Gardens and if you wait another at 9.30pm from the Marina Bay sands.(check times locally)LeVel33 is the highest microbrewery in the world, where you can sip a tasty homemade beer whilst enjoying a spectacular view across Marina Bay. The brews are all freshly made using old-age methods combined with state-of-art technology; the result is some rich and hoppy flavours good enough to satisfy all of Singaporeâ€™s budding beer connoisseurs
5
This restaurant is good choice for your dinner, service, food, beer, and beautiful location. If I have chance for go to Singapore. I want to go this restaurant again.
4
Just came here to get away from the heat. It is a very cool bar and nice atmosphere. You can either sit indoor or outdoor and both places work perfectly fine.
5
This was my fourth time to visit Level33 actually as i like the night view from there to see Marina bay sands & singapore flyer. i had brought my client there and he liked the place very much!
4
The atmosphere was classy, food was alright and the drinks too. Service was good. Overall, an enjoyable experience.
5
This restaurant has matched the view with the quality of staff and the diversity of cuisine. It's spectacular in every way! It's my favorite place in Singapore and quite possibly the best in the world! It is just wonderful. Get there before dusk to see the Marina Bay Area in daylight; then have drinks outside on the balcony as nightfall descends on the Singapore skyline. Try the lamb for main course, cooked in a variety of ways. If this place doesn't impress you, then you know you have a problem. Live the high life at Level33
4
Had a function at Level 33 today. The view was marvelous after some hazy days. The restaurant is quite modern decorated and the use of natural materials gives it a warm appearance. The food - Seafood was served - was excellent and tasty. Definitely one to visit again.
5
I brought my friends to Level33 to celebrate one of my friend's birthday. The staff and overall service was excellent. It was pretty quiet on a Sunday night, probably due to the lousy view. We could still see MBS and Singapore Flyer but the haze made everything look pretty cloudy on the outside.I ordered the Rignatoni pasta as well as their Wheat Beer & Onion Soup . I loved the pasta. It has a very mellow nutty taste to it that was very refreshing, compared to the usual heavy creamy/cheesy flavour.The soup was a wee bit too strong for my liking, probably because i'm not that much of a fan of beer. I would recommend it to those who like beer and alcohol in their food though. The beer blends pretty well with the strong onion flavour
5
We visited for a family 40th anniversary and the staff were able to give us a nice table with a window view - definitely worth asking if it's a special occasion.Level 33 is part restaurant and part microbrewery with a large range of interesting beers, beer snacks and even beer cocktails. That said, when we went we ignored all of that :)It's a rare restaurant in Singapore that doesn't pride itself on rushing you through a meal! We had all the time we wanted, service was excellent and the food was generally very good. It's on the more expensive side but it's good for a special occasion and you get what you pay for.Food wise we had the duck and carpaccio starter, both great and the duck in particular was fantastic. Mains included the Gambas, gnocchi, lamb and Australian wagyu. Of these all were excellent although the wagyu was the weakest of the four - if you want steak, get the rib eye instead.On top of it all it has a fantastic view, haze or no haze it's still nice.Overall, very nice indeed, especially for a special occasion
4
We had lunch at the LeVel 33. Unfortunately, the haze ruined our view and therefore the experience was not as good as we hoped. But hey, that's not the restaurant's fault.Food was good and as a starter we could help ourselves at the buffet, which was nice.Service was friendly and nice - not the fastest though. Restaurant is rather pricey but it's worth it
5
We have been at Level 33 2 times during our recent stay in Singapore - for dinner and also for "simply having a beer" late afternoon. Both very nice. The beer is worth a try for all beers on offer, the food is delicious and the view from the terrace simply stunning.We will certainly return when back to the lion city.
4
Good beer and food. A little on the spendy side but well worth it for the amazing views and outdoor patio. Great light show once it gets dark.
5
First thing I felt after I enter the restaurant was the great environment and nice view. Food was surprisingly good and I especially like the goat cheese. After eating, you could just grab your drink and admire the view.
4
We went there in the evening, and it was perfect. Make sure you have a table outside. The food is tasty.
5
Has Sunday Roast at LeVel 33 abd was impressed with staff attentiveness plus amazing roast food for our Sunday lunch. Looking forward to eating there many times again
4
The food was great and the prices were decent. But the service from the staff made the visit worth it Although we were on the outside the views were great despite a thick haze.
4
This brewery offers a wide selection of great beers (although they are a bit on the expensive side). The price is easily forgiven once you sit down and begin to enjoy the mesmerizing view of the Bay area. Highly recommend to visit if in Singapore!
4
An excellent place for a drink and from which to see the sights/lights of Singapore. The beer was nice, but the prices were high.
3
Was here for drinks and dinner. We initially had a table outside and got some amazing views of the city. Had a Skyfall (a Spicy Mango cocktail which had just the right kick) to drink and a Pasta for Mains (Mushroomy Pasta with a truffle & celeriac cream sauce - was easy on the palate, but not particularly outstanding).The service & views are great - definitely worth a one time visit
3
LeVel 33 was recommended by a Singaporian local to view the light show in the bay.I rang ahead on a sunday evening to book a table so that we would have a view. I was told if I wanted to come at 8.30 there was no need to book.When we arrived we were told if we wanted to be outside to view the bay standing at a bar table was the only option as all other tables on the balcony were reserved.We chose to sit inside but on bar stools - we were charged over $40 SGD for 2 drinks and "fat chips". I approached the maÃ®tre d about moving outside - we were prepared to have a full meal plus drinks if we could have the best view. She informed me that wouldn't be possible. We proceeded to watch a younger group sit at one of the tables outside for about 1/2 hr nursing a couple of left over drinks and taking selfies with no intention of watching the light show or purchasing any more refreshments or food.Shame on the staff who gave me the wrong information about booking a table
4
Love this place. It has spectacular views and the wine is also very good. Great place t have the freshly made beer and the bar food menu aint bad. If you are a tourist the evening and night views are more spectacular and better than other oof top bars in the vicinit
4
The food was good, the service was great and the magnificent view top it all.
Definitely will return.
3
Good Atmosphere & Great view. But food still way to go. Esp the Pork as main course the skin was too hard to chew.
5
Fabulous restaurant in a special setting.Our server Jocelyn was brilliant as were her colleagues. Lovely special evening. Thank you.
5
Go for the view, stay for the ambience and food. Try the beers.
Excellent service and gnocchi to die for, what more can I say.
4
This restaurant has possibly the best location in town. The views of the skyline, especially at night, including the stunning Marina Bay Sands are well worth a visit alone. Couple that with very good food, excellent service and an on-site brewery and you have the recipe for a great night out! It is expensive, but the location makes it all worth it
3
Food was pretty average, the decor looks tired, stains on the tables. We informed the restaurant that it was a special evening, they did nothing!! At least in past experiences at restaurants a song or a small cake with candles is done. Very disappointed. The view was amazing, the staff fantastic, just the experience not as great as we had anticipated
3
Having been to level33 many times for the view and the great beer I always wanted to try their very popular Sunday roast.Sorry to say but it was a complete let down, food was cold and then sent back (all persons) and the meat was either Viet or under cooked. Veggie sides were the best of poor and frankly disappointing meal.My admiration to the front of house who did manage these issues well but so so disappointed
4
We came here on two occasions, first for cocktails and to admire the spectacular city view, and secondly for dinner. The view is simply amazing and on the Saturday night that we went it was standing room only on the balcony. But the drinks were good and while expensive, were worth it for the good atmosphere and great view. On the second occasion we went for dinner and the food was excellent. Unfortunately it was raining so the viewing balcony was closed, but it was still a good atmosphere inside. The service was very attentive and the food was lovely. We had the ocean trout and the back and belly, both being cooked very well and full of flavour. Prices are expensive, around $38-$45 for a main, but well worth the price. Level 33 has a great range of craft beer, and the wheat beer was enjoyed by my partner and I had the London beer cocktail, which was absolutely amazing (and you wouldn't even know it had beer in it from the taste). Definitely come here for a cocktail, to check out the view. Stay for dinner too. Located close to public transport, found that the Downtown MRT stop was the closest one to get off at
4
The dinner was up to expectation but what's makes the experience memorable was our server Zul provides excellent service . I'm impressed. We really appreciate this and hopes the service standards maintains the same the next time we come here. Keep up the good service Zul!
4
We went for my birthday, and even though we didn't book and didn't tell them it was a special day they went the extra mile to find us a table. While we waited we had a drink at the inside bar, which was just fine. The dinner menu selections seemed to be all on the heavy side, things that I would have eaten in winter. Everything we ordered tasted good, but it wasn't the appropriate menu for the climate. Towards the end of the meal, a waiter approached us to ask us if we would like to finish our meal outside as a table had been freed up. I saw a few other couples the them up on their offer, which was very nice. We liked our air conditioning so we declined :-
5
We went here after a recommendation from a friend to have a few drinks and a light snack.
Shame about the haze as it affected the view slightly but non the less was a good experience.
A good selection of beers and fine food.
5
Sweeping, incomparable views of the city. Great wines and food. Excellent, friendly service. Recommend visit on your next trip to Singapore.
4
Beautiful view by the outdoor balcony that overlooks Marina Bay. Perfect place to get an afternoon cuppa of craft beers with a stunning backdrop.
4
Stunning views across the Singapore Cityscape. The food is decent, but quite pricey. they have a nice beer sampling tray
4
Food was average, atmosphere and view was amazing. However, it's good for a first and one time experience.
5
Really enjoyed the meal here. Nice atmosphere, great food, fun staff and great views of the city. Boys loved the beer.
Would recommend highly
3
We went to this restaurant due to a recommendation from a friend for the view and drinks. The view and drinks were both great, however the food was quite disappointing. I asked about getting any bread for the table and was advised it is complimentary and coming out, looking at those surrounding us we were eager for it as it looked great. After a while no bread had come and our sides were served. We ordered 2 x medium rib eyes, we received 2 x rare scotch fillets. The side of spinach wonderful, along with the thick fries we ordered from the bar menu. The rest were simply average.The service was quite slow when it came to ordering drinks, however after going out on to the balcony we ordered from the bar and it was fantastic to enjoy the view. I highly recommend this place for drinks and nibbles rather than a sit down dinner meal
4
We were looking forward to this dinner - and was not disappointed. The food was delicious and tasty, staff were attentive and friendly and the view was amazing. Would go back next time - it was a great nightWe each had a few drinks each, entree, main and coffee, dessert and bill was $510 for 4 persons
5
Holidaying in Singapore and friends had made a reservation for us to meet and lunch her during Grand Prix weekend. Not disappointed - 33 floors up the views are amazing. The beer selection was enjoyed by all, followed by more beers of your chosen favourite. The food (I had gnocchi with lamb and cranberries) was delightful. Hubbie had chicken, the others had sharing platters. All looked lovely. Staff were pleasant and apologetic having forgotten my spinach side dish which came late. But that was not charged for......although we did eat it and it was scrummy. Lovely few hours........
2
I had international guests in town for F1 and was thoroughly disappointed in the quality of food and the reasoning issued from the kitchen that "the rump is just chewy", even after asking to speak to the head chef, who would not come to our table.Although the meals were taken off the bill, I cannot comprehend why the kitchen would knowingly release poor quality food, particularly over a weekend when dining was already subject to a separate surcharge. I will however give credit to the wait staff. They handled themselves impeccably, were polite, efficient and endeavoured to diffuse the situation professionally. Credit to them as representatives of the venue and for shining some light on what was otherwise a disappointing meal and choice of venue. Although the view is spectacular, I would think twice about dining at LeVel33 again
5
Easy to arrive in the Marina Bay Financial Center Tower 1, very good choice of beers, very good service, very good ambient, stunning view on Marina Bay.
5
Food is fresh, excellent and serve quickly
Beautiful view of Singapore by night
Large choice of beer and wine
5
Excellent craft beer & cocktails from a great viewpoint. The beer bar food was restaurant quality & a perfect match for Level 33's craft beers. Service was friendly & efficient.
5
We came for the small party. It's amazing. We can enjoy many kinds of draft beer. Also, food , especially meat is very excellent. We forgot to stay long time. Of course, night view was amazing, too.
5
We had a great evening at LeVeL 33. The view is really exceptional. Service, food and beer excellent.
5
We ate at Level 33 on a recomendation of a friend. We wre not at all disapointed. On arrival our reservation which I made from the UK prior to travel was a little mixed up however a table was made available with minimal fuss despite being busy. The service nad food wre excellent there was no rush to move us on after the meal and we wre free to watch the lazer show from the balcony with drinks. The beer was home made or at least it was claimed and was vbery good. Not cheap but well worth it
4
Albeit rather new, already an iconic place in Singapore. The 5 or 6 different beer types are all brewed inhouse and there is something for every taste. From time to time they also brew seasonal beers.Italian food and starter buffet are yummy. Choice of wines ok but recommend to go for the beer. Stunning view over MBS, the CBD, Flyer, F1 track and national Stadium
5
I had my birthday dinner at Level 33 and it was just the best choice. It is not too fency as other rooftop bars and restaurants, the design makes it a littlebit more casual which makes you feel very comfortable. Their staff is friendly and really reads your mind. They make you feel special. The food was super delicious. I had the corn-fed poulet and the meat was just melting in my mouth. I ordered a dessert but instead they came with a bithday chocolate lava cake with candle and would even sing for me. That was very nice. Thank you very much for this special evening.If you go only for drinks, ask for a table outside so that you can enjoy the beautiful view over the Marina Bay. Or maybe eat inside first and then there will a table available outside
4
We initially wanted to end our tour at the Marina Bay Sands rooftop bar. When our guide asked why we wanted to go to Marina Bay, we said it was for the view. He then recommended two other places where, in his opinion, the view would be better as it included several iconic Singapore buildings. One of the recommended places was Level 33. We initially got space at the standing area at the bar's terrace. The view was really wonderful, especially during the hourly light and sound show at Marina Bay. The craft beers the bar is known for, did not disappoint. Overall, the killer view and the chalet vibe of the place, made for a very relaxing experience. It's a wonderful way to cap a day of eating and walking
4
This is a regular spot for my friends and I especially when we have visitors. Most people like to go to Marina Bay Sands, but I think the view from here of Marina Bay Sands, the Singapore Flyer etc is much better. They brew their own beer and it is pretty good. The snacks are good but not cheap. I've never had dinner here, but have heard good things. Every time I have tried to book a table for Friday or Saturday evening, even over a week in advance, whether early or later, I always get the same response "We are fully-committed at our outdoor terrace." However, when we arrive, there is never anyone there but the tables are all reserved. It is a bit annoying since we always spend so much money there and there are usually at least 10 of us. I have had lunch there once and it is pretty good value for money, but make sure you make a reservation. This time I reserved over 1 month in advance. It is SGD 33 for appetizer/salad/dessert buffet + main dish. Overall, it is place we like to go for views, atmosphere and beer. They also do an awesome Bloody Mary, but cocktails are quite pricey
5
food was great, the staff was particularly helpful as well. Went there at 1145am with the first booking of the day, probably the best experience yet if you want a nice quiet branch with a loved one on a saturday afternoon.
5
nice view, nice food, nice drink, nice time..... its worth to spend minimum 60 dollars for one person.
4
The best view of all the major landmarks in Singapore! Simply Amazing! Try their Singapore Sling Cocktail.
3
This place is good for their beer. Many varieties and freshly brewed. You can smell the present small of malt in this restaurant.
The buffet lunch is horrible. The main course is totally not edible.
The good beer make up for the rest of misfortune.
4
Great view of the Marina Bay area. Have a drink or two on the balcony. Their wheat beers are very drinkable. The inside area looks like a nice place for a bite to eat.
5
The roast lunches at Level 33 never disappoint! We have been loyal visitors over the past 4 years. Can highly recommend the roast beef ... And if you fancy sharing the lamb is a great shout! Great craft beers on tap and an extensive wine list.
3
Certainly the cheaper version of the best view in town rather than going up into Marina Bay Sands hotel or the Flyer. Sitting outside with a beer enjoying the view is certainly worth it.Have good craft beer and all around us the tasters were popular. We ordered 4 steaks and 2 of them was under-done and not medium as requested and had to be sent back. The fat marble on the one that stated +9 was certainly not up to par either as there was just a lump of fat on it and it wasn't marbled like you will find elsewhere. The upside was the side dishes of patatos and spinach but not enough to give ti a splendid rating.Go for a beer and enjoy the view
2
I joined friends last Friday night, approx. 2030. My friends were waiting for desserts to arrive when we asked for two extra chairs to join the table. After 10mins of waiting around and speaking to a number of staff, incl the manager we were told "no spare chairs, we are full ". We fully understood this actually so I stated we would have a drink at the bar and wait.On route to the bar we pasted two spare chairs, I asked for these to to moved to the table. This request was refused as they are reserved for walk in's. I stated I was a walk in and he laughed at me and said yes, but no you still can't have the chairs. My friends stated they would cancel their desserts if I couldn't join them at the table and we were told " that's your choice, go on then" However within minutes two chairs were bought over. We had desserts and another round of drinks, so revenue was given however we won't be in a hurry to return. Infact my local friends are cancelling a reservation for next month, party of 9!
5
I've been there several time with colleagues after work, the place has a marvellous view over the Marina including all buildings around (Marina Bay Sands and many towers...).The staff is very nice and kind and always doing his best to help you find a seat when it's crowded.They brew their own beer which is a good one.I really recommended this place, if you are simply a tourist here for few days, take a moment having a drink there, you'll not regret
4
Finding the entrance was a bit tricky, there's a small elevator tucked away in the corner of the entrance lobby of Tower 1, there's some building work going on at the Base of the towers which made it more difficult. We were only there for a drink and to take in the view but the staff were accommodating and directed is to the balcony area. We had arrived just befits sun set, the busiest time I had thought, but there was seating available inside, however we chose to stand outside. I ordered at the bar, the ipa was OK, not an ipa as I would expect, not at all hoppy. The fruit juice mocktail was more expensive than my .5 litre beer which I was surprised about. The view is great at that time in the evening, the bar interior was nicely done and it seemed very popular with after work drinkers, particularly the British!
4
I always enjoy my visits to Level 33. I find Chope easy to use. My only request is to allow customers to book a table on the terrace and not just in the restaurant.
2
A lot of waiter and waitresses around but not excellent on providing customer services. Was able to asked for water refill thrice. Waiter is kinda rude (head is shaking as if sarcastic action towards the customers) on confirming the wine my team mate ordered.
5
Level 33, great experience. Get there at 6ish to enjoy the view and then watch as evening descends over the CBD and the lights come on. Great service, good food, good beer, and that view, why wouldn't you want to spend an evening there?
4
the tallest micro brewery in the world. great view and tried their beer sampler. however liked the german wheat beer the most. depending on your preference you will find something you like for sure.
definitely going back some time soon.
4
its nearly perfect except for these 2 things.1. this place is known for their splendid view, but despite the fact that i made a reservation about 1 week in advance, we were given a table with a "not-so-impressive" view. my bad for not making the additional request though. but that's fine, the ambience was perfect and food was pretty yummy too. im returning for sure, so i hope (fingers crossed), i will get the better view next time!2. the lift there is a pain. it took me 10mins to get out of the place. you guys might want to look into this. im pretty sure i'm not the only one complaining about this.otherwise, all's good for me, nothing I can't accept
4
Had a large group lunch - all of us were on the set menu. Decent value for S$33++ given the buffet style starters and dessert but disappointed on almost all the mains available. Of the provided selection the fish and chips were the most decent, burger was overcooked and dry, rice risotto was bland and steak sandwich was dry with no taste. Only recommended for view and after work beer

This place as it's name is located at Level 33 of the MBFC tower 1. If you are seated along the window, you will get to enjoy the great view. Food is reasonable and for lunch the price is a bit up but acceptable for that little celebration. Great place to hang out with your pals

The good - very nice view. Overlooking marina bay sands, the Bay Area and the durians, the view is the only wow factor for this place.The bad - very poor food quality. We ordered steaks and ribs. The steak was chewy, probably they served buffalo meat and passed off as fine steaks.The ugly - service. Unfriendly, pushy and rushing diners made us finished our meal quickly and left to another place for desserts.Not recommended. For fine pub food and great view, I suggest Cook and Brew at the Westin

We were around 12 people group that sit inside the restaurant. The waiters were taking our order fast, but the order were coming more than 30 minutes later, except the drink.I ordered wagyu steak to be cooked as medium well, but apparantly it came out as medium rare. When I asked chilli sauce, the waiter said they had, and until I finished my dinner, the chili sauce never came. The view was amazing from terrace, as you could see Singapore view in the afternoon.

2nd time there. Didn't really care about city view because we can have a better view elsewhere.Food and customer service however, was excellent!Only disappointing thing is that there is no discount for customers celebrating birthdays and no credit card promotions.Great work team. Keep it up
4
An interesting place for trying all beers... very interesting testing beer tray...
Foods are OK... the most impressive thing is the view from outdoor... whole singapore in your eyes...
4
Great food. The steaks we had were cooked well. Beers were good too. Will recommend the IPA.
Great ambience and great view of the Marina Bay Sands area. Awesome service too.
Great place for couples.
5
Great place with amazing view, excellent crowd and good food. A must visit in Singapore if you want to have great evening

Our son who lives and works in Singapore took us to this bar on our first night. The view of Marina Bay is absolutely stunning, real Wow Factor! Best time to visit is from 7.00pm when daylight turns to dusk. They do sell food there but we did not try the food. Drinks are a bit pricey but well worth the cost for the Wow Factor. They have a short laser show from the harbour and I reckon we got a better view of it from the Level 33 bar. It does get busy and the number to call to book is +65 6834 313

No doubt that views are gorgeous, but the rest - not so much.They keep your credit card if you want to keep a tap open. It's not something new, but feels a bit weird that this supposedly high-class place treat you as a potential criminal who might run away without paying.Beer-wise it was unimpressive. Almost all of their beers are ales (+stout and porter) which are essentially cheapest to brew. Do not get me wrong, it's awesome to get fresh IPA, but you go to such trendy microbrewery places to be impressed by their brewing abilities, not to get pint of beer that one can brew in their own kitchen. And on top of that it's the most expensive self-brewed beer in Singapore. They could not even tell ABV of their porter, although it can and should be easily determined with simplest tools for every batch they brew.Food that comes in bar menu was not that good, so we did not feel like staying for the dinner
5
Very recommended place to chill and enjoy Singapore's skyline. Their service staffs are really beyond standards, everyone were very attentive, cheerful and sincere. We had small incident where i toppled a glass and the ice and water was everywhere on the table and floor, but within seconds the staffs brought out the cleaning tools and all was back to normal in second, when we were still laughing about the incident. Top service and worth every pennies! Special mention to Azri!

Went here for a business lunch. Not surprisingly, this restaurant got a superb view. I think you must make a reservation in order to get a table during lunch, as this restaurant is located at the cbd and seems it is a popular place for casual business lunch.Based on my reservation, most diners ordered the fish and chips, but since I don't have appetite for oily food, I've picked the pasta, which was quite refreshing. People at my table ordered fish and chips, but they think that's just so so
5
Being fortunate enough to live in this fine city, we like to take first time visitors to Level 33 for a good daylight/twilight/nighttime panoramic view.Every time I have been here the service has been very good, the food and the drink excellent.I would recommend being here from 6/6.30 pm as then you will see the city during daylight and start to see the lights come on as darkness descends. The food and drink is not the cheapest in town but the view and the ambience outweighs that, in my humble opinion
4
A great place for a view over the bay, city and port. The beer is brewed on the premises. A bit expensive, but great novelty experience. Food also available, although we just called in for a drink. No pressure, good service and an outside terrace to sit and relax
4
Great atmosphere and view. The food and service are very good, unfortunately so are the prices. High dollars for small portions (typical "French cuisine" portions). The menu provides various "twists" with cooking things in beer, which is refreshing. Obviously this place partially lives off it's reputation as a micro-brewery and it's views over Marina Bay, but you can spend a nice night out here in a business or romantic setting as well. If you bring the gold card
4
Very impress with the service by Michael, he did give good recommendation on our ordering, promptly attend to our request, and very friendly manner to us...
Lamb is not very nice, the rest of the meal is very good.
4
LeVeL 33 serves really good steak at a very decent price. The Waitress are well equip with knowledge of the food prepared. Nice place for chillax with excellent view! Just remember to book a table before you visit :)
4
This is my favorite one and I regularly visit with family or with business partners. This restaurant works for both purposes well. The beer from its own microbrewery is good, particularly their IPA is my favorite. Food is not very cheap but restaurant's great view pays. MBS's laser show starts at 8pm and we always target that hour to be there to see it.
2
Chaotic service. Given the cost and location I would expect the service to be reflective. We waited half an hour for bread, had to consistently pour our own wine and water throughout the night, sat with dirty plates in front of us for a further half hour between starter and main waiting for them to be cleared, waited for a birthday celebration dessert which was promised but never arrived. Such a shame as its a beautiful setting and the food, while it didn't blow me away, was of a good standard ingredients wise though over-priced - seems such a shame to be let down by something as simple as clearing plates and pouring drinks! A minor point but also one of those locations where the too bright spotlights from the ceiling shine in your eyes - turning them down a notch could have improved the ambience
4
I have eaten here on a few occasions as the view is amazing on the food is also very good. I have found the service to be also fine, with no memorable bad occasions.It is also a great place to come and have a beer and look out over Marina Bay.I do feel though it's a little pricey but not too bad.S0me of their meat is absolutely top class..
4
if you want to treat friends, family,colleagues or just yourself with a superb view, this is it.If you stand the humid climate,have a table right on the balconyto enjoy the fantasic view.beers and food doesnot come cheap, but if you look for a bargain, you have to look up to see birds flying not down like you do her
5
Ideal for after work beverages or a casual night out. Level 33 offers spectacular views of Singapore and the notable Marina Bay Sands. Their specialty is their in-house beers and offer tasting flights (recommended), beer cocktails (blah) and attractively presented highballs. Steaks were excellent. Make reservations, as tables, especially on weekends might be difficult to procure
3
The view of the Singapore CBD is amazing from the outside deck at LeVel 33. The beer was good, but they offer limited varieties and I personally prefer the micro-brews at Brewerkz.For food, we ordered several items from the beer bites menu. Everything was good, but, in my opinion, overpriced for what you got. My recommendation from the beer bites menu is the tapas, which is also overpriced, but took me far longer to consume than the other items I ordered, making it seem like a better deal.I would say that it is definitely worth going to LeVel 33 once, whether you're a tourist or a local. Go and enjoy the amazing view - but once is probably enough for anyone
5
This unique restaurant set on the 33rd floor takes your breath away with the view of Singapore. Watching the sun set and then the fabulous laser show across Marina Bay is an experience I will never forget. Then there is the food! Wonderfully attention to detail and swift service by staff that float by silently and attentively. A unique dining experience and one not to be mussed when visiting Singapore. They have their speciality brews, mastered on site as well
5
If you can sit outside on the deck, make sure to do that. Especially if it is around 8pm. The bay lights up with a laser light show. Best view of the bay and very peaceful. Food was pretty good as well, and beer was top notch
2
The view was spectacular, especially for first timer. However, the initiate wow factor started to diminish when the food arrived. Surprisingly unspectacular food for the kind of price. Heard that the beer was good but I am not a beer drinker.
4
Went for Sunday lunch. Good portion sizes and tasty but overall a little cold. An expensive outing but worth it!
5
My first visit to this restaurant. A pleasant surprise with great food.
The staff were very friendly and attentive.
Best "sales people" with good recommendation from the menu.
Be seated before sunset, you will witness the place with sunlight and the night.
Simply stunning.
5
Great bar with their own brewery and good beers! Best is the view - all Singapore!!! Food looked good although we didn't eat. They also have there wheat beer which is not so common in Asia.
4
They have a very good house brew beers particularly the IPA and Stout. The place has a view that overlooks Marina Bay Sands which is simply spectacular.
Place could be pricey as a pint of beer after 8PM costs around 18SGD.
4
Great choices for buffet lunch salad selection, choices for main can be upgraded, very friendly service and wonderful views of Singapore.
3
Where there a couple of times for beer. The own beer actually is very tasty. The view of the place is really nice and a better deal than on other rooftops in the town. However, when it comes to food (went or lunch on business occasions) it is a different story. They are too ambitious and try to give some "special flavor" to their dishes. The salad bar is decent, nevertheless hardly ever had such a bad pasta and fish. The majority of our group didn't finish its plates (some of them didn't continue eating after two bites). I was surprised that the service staff didn't notice that and ask if something is wrong
4
A group of family and friends dined here with us and we were fortunate to watch the Singapore air force practicing for the 50 year celebrations. Three F18s flew past at what seemed like window level and one did a circuit around the Marina Bay Sands - unique dining!!Location is superb with indoor and outdoor dining. Views are great and once darkness descends the laser show can be viewed.Food is excellent, good sized portions overall and presentation is very good. Service is top notch and wait staff were good humoured and knowledgeable. Beer options are interesting and some were unique to me.Enjoyable night topped off with great food and location
4
Level 33 is located at MBFC Tower 1, with a separate elevator to the restaurant. The Restaurant itself was nice, with lots of seatings outside (for view), or inside for comfort of aircon. You'll need to reserve a table in advance if you want a good spot. The place seems very busy on a Friday night, when we were there. The beer was nice, we tried the sampler, which had 5 different types of beer. They also had beer cocktail for the adventurous folks. We had beer snacks like fish and chips (must try), pork ribs, veal ribs, bread dips.. all were very nice. The price is not cheap though, I guess given it's in MBFC, it's expected. This place definitely worth a try
4
For a nice dinner and great views come to Level 33. I have never been disappointed with the food here. Menu changes so its hard to do a review. But its a good mix of western and Asian dishes. they do brew their own beer there and do offer flights. But you can also get the old standy buys of Heineken or TigerView are spectular! But make a reservation and let them know you want one for outside (either before or after dinner) and one for inside During dinner. You will not be sorry you did
4
Decided to try out level33 as a birthday surprise dinner treat for my bf. We were very well taken care of by the waitress whom had been very polite and friendly. The scenic view of the city was beautiful. However the food was average.
4
On our recent visit we started with a beer tasting, before enjoying some of our favourites. The craft beers were of a good quality, made even nicer by the spectacular views over the city and bay area. Well worth a visit.
5
Level 33, it’s got to be my favorite place to unwind after hard day’s work , it feature the World's Highest Urban Craft-brewery , this is a new concept which presents an unparalleled dining experience complete with one of the best views of Singapore's Marina Bay and city skyline. Located in the penthouse at Marina Bay Financial Centre, Level 33 is the new quintessence of urban penthouse dining. With the copper brew house kettles taking centre stage, all are reminded of the freshly brewed beer that flows out of the heart of Level 33. Contemporary design is evoked with the use of wood textures and earth tones; the wonderfully integrated interiors of the craft-brewery reconcile aesthetics, form and functionality in this elevated space. Thoroughly enjoyed our experience highly recommended the visit to locals and visitors
4
Nice warm atmosphere with a lovely view. The set lunch options come with a decent sized salad & dessert spread. We went with some out of town friends so they could enjoy the view and although its location attracts a business crowd, the atmosphere is comfortable and not stuffy. Their craft beers are a highlight and must try. Enjoyable with great service
3
This venue offered one of the best views I can recall in Asia Pacific from recent memories of my travels.It offered very good panoramic views over the harbour, and other outstanding landmarks. When the lights came on across the city, wow! Beautiful.I accompanied a very large group and was well booked in advance.The wait staff were appalling. Rude, inattentive, forgetful. And that wasn't just my opinion. 20 others were complaining. It became a joke.My advice to them... If you don't want the job...leave. Let someone else who wants a job take yours. Do everyone a favour... Leave.Sounds harsh, but he service was really that bad.The food on the other hand was good.It wasn't fantastic, but it was good. Would I go there myself gain? Possibly - but for the view only.Would I recommend it to others? Sadly no.I say sadly, as the location, view, food are good...very good...but the engagement and quality of staff ... No.
4
Once you find where the restaurant is located, the views are outstanding. I had booked it for a business group of 16 persons and we were given the exclusive use of the private room. The entire group was enthralled that they could sit in the balcony (which we reserved) to have drinks and enjoy the evening view of the marina area. Even with such a large group, service was prompt and attentive. Most of the group had the scallops which were excellent and 1-2 persons even thought of asking for a second serving! The main course was either braised beef brisket or cod fish and both were good. The beef was flavourful and very tender but alittle too dry. Wine selection was excellent and altogether a great experience enhanced by the great views. The private room was very quiet once the doors were closed and really allowed conversation amongst the participants which was not drowned out by the very busy and noisy restaurant.Will definitely consider returning
4
As the title states, I would prefer the Ploughman's table during lunch set menu compared to the main course. Not saying that it's very bad, but it's just not to my liking. The fish n chips is not bad, same goes to the beef burger. Good season on the meat, and good portion size. Just that for the fish & chip the pea purée doesn't work well for me. The view there is excellent and our waiter Zul & Sally as well. They were very helpful to our requests. I made special arrangements beforehand and Zul was prepared with my requests. The only thing that bothers me is the waiting time for our main course. We were starving till we had a little too much on the appetisers making us slightly unable to finish our mains. But overall it was a good experience, beers were good as well, will return back for the beers and appetisers

I have used "Level 33' many times for lunch and have always found the experience very good in terms of food quality and value for money. However Dinner on Fri 22nd May where we were entertaining friends was quite different. It didn't augur well in the first instance trying to book a window table when having been told they were 'subject to availability' I established there were indeed window tables available only to be told again they were 'subject to availability'. Only when I challenged that confusing assertion did the supervisor confirm a window table. The issue. For four people all of whom had an appetiser, main meal and two bottles of wine , no dessert or coffee etc the bill was a tad over S$600. For that price I would have expected a less packed restaurant , better food presentation and less like a pub. For its dinner offering Level 33 has to decide whether it is a pub or a restaurant but not both. It is to busy and to cramped. If the view is the selling point at night there is not much to see unless you are outside. if I compare with two other recent dinner experiences "IndoChine at Gardens on the Bay" and "Jim Thompson at Dempsey" both offered a far better experience. I would still use Level 33 for lunch but Dinner they are way off on price point versus value

I'd been here a few weeks ago for a business lunch and picked up a card advertising Saturday Brunch - I enjoy the boozy Sunday ones but Mondays are a struggle anyway so the idea of having a day to recover seemed a good one. We gathered some friends and made the booking.Beers pretty good, although the service was a bit slow I thought. It seemed as though they only had one set of beer taps and not surprisingly the place was busy. I wondered how it would be on a Friday night with a crowd of thirsty souls.The buffet was OK, some nice beef, but no sauce to go with it so it was all a bit dry. They had a live foie gras cooking station, pretty decent fg so thumbs up for that. Fair selection of salads, charcuterie and cheese, although I wasn't blown away by the desserts - needs some work there guys.A couple of the ladies preferred wine to beer so we ordered a white and a red - I felt the winelist was a bit thin, pricey even for here and when they came, not that great. We drifted outside and enjoyed the view for a while, it was nice and breezy up there so another thumbs up.11.30 - 15.30 swilling beer and food for $100++ is not bad here, but if your ladies don't like beer then it may not be for them. Maybe a boy's day out would be better(!
5
We celebrated my birthday at Level 33 and had a wonderful experience. Great friendly service and good food. The view was amazing, and we timed it just right to see the beautiful sunset. They even brought out a special birthday treat at the end of the night. We will definitely return.
4
good food and the view made this an exceptional evening. there are restaurants with better food but this view is not to be beat and I'd come again for sure!Friendly staff, good beer but pricy
5
the food is like the location, trendy, high and tasty. Winelist is extensive but expensive. Home-brew beer is advised on hot days!
5
Unlike any rooftop bar u don't have to pay entrance fees. The view are amazing! We visit this pub each time we come over to Singapore. They have their own brewery, Beers are great and not too pricey. It s worth a visit!
5
Good food and great service. The beer was excellent and the main courses cooked perfectly. As for the service the staff made us feel very welcomed and once our meal was over in the main restaurant they offered us a table outside to enjoy the view. This was not expected on a busy Friday, but was most welcomed
5
We came here for their famous draft beer and view. The bar was very busy but we were lucky to get a table. When we saw the city view from the balcony we all went WOW. It was such a spectacular view of beautiful Singapore city view. The beer was great. It was a bit hard to get staff attention as they were very busy but it was acceptable. I would definitely return when I visit Singapore next time.
5
You will never get enough of the view from this place. Located on MBFC Tower 1, you will get more excitement during yout visit to Singapore. Nice and friendly staffs will serve you well. What special about this place is that you can see the highrise building scenery on the left, the lake or lagoon in the middle and the famous marina Bay Sands here, which you will not get the full benefit from the Skypark. Affordable price, some beers, handy snacks, sparkling water, and lime juice will cost you only SGD 141 for 3 persons, quite affordable
4
This time round, I settled for one Ploughman's Table buffet (SGD$28.00). I attacked the Prosciutto ham, Cocktail Shrimps, Smoked Salmon and salad. The salmon and shrimps were very springy and bouncy as I had expected, sweet in their freshness. The crisp greens made for a lovely starter as well. I had two servings of this.Then we shared a Set Lunch (SGD$33.00) comprising of a main course, and anything from the salad bar. For this time round, we chose the Fish and Chips, something we'd been orgling at during the last visit because it was so beautiful and artistic, shaped into a graceful arc as though it were swimming in the air.The fish was crispy on the outside; the flesh was luscious in flavour and smooth in texture; it was a huge slab but we got through it rather quickly because it was just delicious. The potato fingers were crackling on the exterior and contained mashed potato within - perfect for potato and wedges lovers.For full review and more detailed information, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2015/06/lunch-at-level-33-mbfc-revisit-again.htm
5
I had a lovely dining experience, great quality food with an awesome view. Love the a wide spread of salad and dessert selection to choose from. Sometimes, it may be hard to get the attention of the waiter/waitress for service - would be great if they make more frequent rounds or more wait staff
4
Let's face it, this place is a one trick pony with the view being the only reason why you would come here with plenty of other places available in Sing. So I was glad that I had a seat on the balcony and I can imagine being disappointed if that was not the case and travelling up 33 floors to sit indoors staring at a wall.Staff are OK, but can be a trifle snooty. The food is very average and the beer is of the micro brewery kind with quite a limited list of blancs and dark malt beers. There are no commercial lagers like Stella or Guinness, but the wine list is very good.Anyway, the reason why you come is the view and that does not disappoint. The outside balcony is around a corner and so incorporates both the city skyline and the port. You can spend hours looking at the every changing world below and rack up a hefty bill in the process!

Been there for late night drinks on a Sunday.Came without a reservation and there was pleanty of seats inside but we had to wait for a few minutes before a outside table became available (you can also stand outside if you don't mind not sitting).Beer selection is good, the taste is very good and better than I expected it to be.The IPA is very fruity and tasty, the Wheat Beer for my taste too sweet but the Misses loved it. The lager is good.The downside was that from like 8pm onwards they increase the prices by nearly 50%, I would be OK with that on a Friday or Saturday but Sunday night???Overall its not cheap, you pay for the view you get, take it as a experience not just drinking.We didn't eat as we had pleanty of street food before we came to Level 33.I will come back, maybe a bit earlier to get the better deal on the beer prices
5
Just went for a beer with friends, stunning view from the balcony, great service, a selection of decent beers to choose from including a beer tasting platter.
4
Excellent food and ambiance. Brilliant views. Try the speciality beers. Staff very attentive. We went for Sunday lunch (very English). The Yorkshire puds were great. (All that way for a Yorkshireman to have his pudding!!
3
Dessert was terrible, was a chocolate mousse which could have come from a plastic container in a supermarket with a strange cookie in t centre. Entree and mains were not bad, but really not outstanding and overpriced. For a city known for its great food this is a place to avoid. Good view and good boutique beer though
4
Went on a Monday night and was still reasonable in terms of crowd indoors, outdoors was full. Ribeye was ok & had tried better elsewhere. Veal Chop was disappointing as it was too fatty for my friend's liking. Also tried their beer : Stout & another Wheat which was good. Will not be back for the mains but definitely for beer and snacks which is price-affordable. I am not sure if reservations are allowed but please do for the outdoor seatings
1
My friends and i went to the bar on Saturday night. We were ushered in and told to wait at the beautiful balcony until a seat was ready. We admired the beautiful fireworks for the next 15 minutes before seeing a group of 6 leave. I inquired and asked if we could take a seat. However, the waiter told us that we had to put our number on a reservation list and it was found on the way into the bar. I was quite shocked that the person that ushered us in did not inform us and wasted our time. I proceeded to the bar to look for the reservation list and did not find any! Was this a prank? i spoke to the manager and asked about this mysterious waiting list. He did not answer the question but asked for my number instead. At the point in time, NO apology was given by the staff nor the manager. I decided to return back to wait. There was still no news about the wait list for the next 5 minutes. Finally when the text came, there were 15 people in front of me. I had wasted time, with bad service at such a highly recommended place. It is absolutely disappointing
4
I had been here almost 3 years ago, I was with bunch of friends.. Once of my friend took us here for Drinks.. This place is very amazing who serves amazing view of rest of city and also lovely drinks... Will go here again on my next trip to Singapore... Cheers..
4
from this side of the bay you have a great view allover,you can see marina sands bay hotel - stunning, the flyer and the whole city, as the harbour with hundreds of ship waiting to be off or onloaded.freshly brewed beer of various types, very nice.fingerfood during the afternoon, lunch and dinner at reasonable price
3
*Level 33 bar and restaurant - we went here at around 10pm and they're closing at 12 midnight. The view was amazing. You can see the whole marina Bay Area, bay front, including all the business building and hotels. Staffs are friendly and quick in attending your needs. You need to give your credit card for deposit and they will give it back when your leaving. If your going to have reservation, you need to spend S$120 minimum. We had 2 pint beer and 2 half pint plus small serving of mix beer nuts total cost S$80.At 23.30h, all the waiters and waitress seems rushing cleaning the whole bar, restaurant and viewing deck which doesn't makes me feel comfortable. They should be cleaning when all customers are gone. Will go back here and try their food next time.

I saw this restaurantadvertised on the TV in the room andwhuilst I knew it would be busy I wasn't prepared for such long wait for a table. We were told that one would be available in 20 minutes so we got a drink and waited, after 40 minutes I asked about the table and was told it would be ready shortly, eventually we were seated 1.5 hours and various enquiries later! Obviously if we had been told it was such a long wait we had have gone elsewhere, it was disappointing to be strung along. I can understand that they may think someone is finishing a meal and will be finished in 20 minutes and it takes 30 minutes, but NOT 1.5 hours!! My partner fancied a cocktail and I asked the waitress if they served anything that was very sweet and strawberry based. She advied on a particular cocktail, but when it arrived it was basically a lager with a tinge of strawberry in it. As with all of SIngapore cocktails are not cheap and this was a rip off. Ridiculous. She blatantly lied. I appreciate they want to promote their beers, but flavoured lager is not a sweet strawberry liqueur cocktail. When we were told about the original waiting schedule, I was surprised that we weren't offered a menu, so we asked for one, so that we could choose our meal whilst waiting. When we were shown to our table, which had menus on it, we were left. Presumably to choose our meal!!! After a few minutes I stood up to go and fetch someone and when they approached they were surpirised we were ready to order!!!!After our meal we went to go outside and was told that we could still not sit at the outside balcony tables as they were reserved. We stood at the end and one of these tables was empty for the ten minutes we stood finishing our drinks. All in all the views are great, but the service is poor. I am not sure why they are spending money promoting their bar to tourists, when they clearly don't want us here. Avoid
5
The view from here is simply awesome and stunning. You can catch the laser and pyrotechnics show from Marina Bay Sands here too. Fabulous food and great service staff too. It is a must visit place for my overseas friends. I like the "Wow" that cried out.
5
Great place to chill out and enjoy a glass of wine while enjoying the amazing views that this place has to offer.
4
I went with a group of friends but there were a lot of business diners from Raffles Place- more hip venue for meetings. Amazing view of the marina and food was surprisingly good. I recommend this place for visitors, friends/groups and business dinners.
5
Must go place in SG
Overlooking MBS and Marina Bay city area
Food is delicious and of course they have their own brew of beers!
So sit back, drink, eat, relax and enjoy the view
Cheers!

We enjoyed our experience at Level 33 with stunning landscape view. Great craft and own brewed beers selection with top service standard. Foods were also great especially sizzling beef. It's gonna be my favorite place to hangout. Highly recommended!!! Thumbs UP.
3
I had a veg Pasta and the pasta was under done . it tasted like a rubber and the sauce was very think and tasteless .
I had to leave behind most of the order , other wise the ambiance was great
4
Very nice buffet for starters and a variety of main courses. Food and choice was perfect and we enjoyed therafter a few moments on the - at lunch time - empty balcony. We enjoyed to see the Marina Bay at lunch time.Sorry - nearly forgot to mention, that there is also a buffet with sweets ..

This is our second visit to LeVel 33 since our last visit last year. Our group of three had the beer dining on a Friday evening. Though we were there early, the place was packed. We requested for a table at the terrace outside but however, none were available. We were put on the waiting list and were seated near the window. After some time, a table was available and we moved to the terrace outside. We ordered the freshly brewed craft beer, fish & chips, fat chips and chicken drumlets. Though not a beer drinker, I like the Blond Lager which is light and smooth. The fish & chips came in bite sized pieces, and tasted marvelous. Likewise for the fat chips and chicken drumlets. The service is good and the staff are attentive and friendly.The view of Marina Bay is simply magnificent, as well as the beautiful evening scenery of the high rise buildings. This is a great place to chill out and to bring foreign friends when they are here for a visit.We would like to visit LeVel 33 again on a regular basis
3
The place has a great view of the Singapore skyline but it's difficult to get a table if you did not make reservations ahead. We went for a couple of drinks on a Sunday night at 9.30pm and were told by the staff that the bar was full. Had to be placed at the standing area. We then noticed that the restaurant tables were empty and requested to get a table there. Shockingly, the respond given was that they could not let us sit at the restaurant area as the kitchen closes at 10pm. The service needs further improvement as it wouldn't hurt to at the very least suggest the seats at the entrance. We would not have mind as we wanted to just rest our tired feets and enjoy a couple of drinks.I'm rating the restaurant as average despite the comments above as it still does have good beer (try the beer paddle) and great views

Stopped in for a couple of drinks with some friends. It gets really busy, as it draws a massive after-work crowd, so be prepared to wait for seats if you are planning on going after working hours. This place has a breathtaking view of the bay area though, well worth the wait

This is probably the most over-hyped establishment in Singapore. Its only attraction is its breathtaking view and thats it! The uniquely brewed beer is tasteless and the food appears to have been laid out under the sun (during the day) and served dried and shrivelled. The staff look disgruntled, and none of them smiles. The manager gave a deathly look to a fellow waiter who dropped a plate near us. You could see the expletives being conveyed from his eyes to this poor girl who disappeared in a flash after the incident occurred. Upon our arrival, we were told the place is completely booked out, but walking in we observed that apart form the tables outside (in the balcony area), two thirds of the tables (inside) were unoccupied and remained that way during the entire time we were there. So much for the hype! Last but not least, value for money. This is not the place to visit unless you have someone else picking up the tab or a company sponsored event. Having visited this place before, I would have expected that improvements would have been made..sadly not. My suggestion would be if you're there just for the view, bring along your selfie stick, take a couple of photos or get the waiters to assist and go elsewhere to dine/drink. This joint, badly needs a facelift and a entirely new approach in how it wishes to attract customers as currently its survival is with people who largely work in the building and its surroundings

Had lunch here with friends and family.the food was excellent.great value for money,great buffet starters and deserts.all this comes with fabulous views of singapore
5
Great views, good food and wide selection of wines etc. Great atmosphere and ambience. Excellent service

Our out of town colleagues enjoyed the view as much as they did the beer. We reserved a table on the terrace (be aware minimum spend per person applies) and ordered the

Our husband and I went with friends one evening and had an amazing time. The beer was incredible me the food amazing. The view is why people go there I think. One of the best views in Singapore. Want to go back for sure.

I first visited Level 33 a couple of years ago and found the beer to be quite low in quality.However, I had met the new head brewer during that visit and decided to hold off until I could visit again some time after he could reset the beer menu.The beer at this place is now very, very good. It is traditional German style beer except for a somewhat mild variation on an IPA. Everyone at the table enjoyed the beers.The food was somewhat a surprise. I didn't remember much about the food from the first visit so didn't expect much. Yet we all found the meals to be extremely flavorful and a decent value considering the view that you get as part of the experience.Reserve in advance ... it was packed even on a Tuesday evening @ 19.0
5
Whenever I am in Singapore, I try to fit in a dinner here. The craft beer is very good and the European fusion cuisine is amongst the best in Singapore.The view is great, so I would always request a table at the window or outside.Great for dinner with friends, family or as a romantic evening.I also heard the lunch menu offers great value. Mabye next time ...
5
Thumbs up for the Chinese lady serving us that evening. Didn't get her name. We are seated along the window table, opposite the food bar.As it was seafood week, they recommend the lobster salad for a start. It's not on the menu. I wish it was coz it was really good!After our meal, we took a walk outside, for the night view and photo-taking. I'm glad we have not been rush thru the meal, clear table for other diners, as there are many others in the Q when we are leaving.Recommend to reserve your table for dinner
5
You have there a brewery for Beer it is the highest Brewery in the world , the beer blond was very good and of course the food I like the most the Lamb in the oven and also the other sea food, the people there was very good and nice
4
Took a friend who came to visit for a few days, and we had a good lunch, of course the pest part is the view. Unfortunately, they don't allow you to have lunch outside, so we asked for a table close to the window. She ordered gnocchi (big portion and quite nice), while I had chicken - quite small plate for 32++. The service was excellent, wine very good, however you pay more for the view than the food - which remains quite average
4
We visited the restaurant at lunch time and were knocked out by the view across the city and the straights. You could easily pay 20 dollars per person for that view without any food so it puts the 200 plus price for lunch for four people into context. The food was good with a limited menu but not outstanding. The service was well above the average for Singapore and the beer brewed on the premises was a real bonus. In summary a very pleasant occasion that I would strongly recommend to anyone visiting Singapore for the first time
5
This restaurant is amazing! The food was the best we have had in Singapore. It is expertly prepared and the recommended in house beer matchings are perfect. To top it off, the view is incredible. Bookings are a must.
5
In town for a reunion and pre dinner drinks with the stunning view over the city not to be topped. Snacks were also very nice. Hard to get reservation on weekends.
5
Do it... Excellent beer!! Amazing views... Friendly welcoming staff... And great food.... But book ahead if going during peak periods...
4
Nice place for gathering, couples. Superb night view. Total 6 of us, average spent $50-$80 for dinner.
5
No complaints from our party of five that enjoyed dinner on a Sunday night. We had a 6:30 reservation and were able to enjoy a drink outside before moving inside to our reserved table. (We had a one year old with us and luckily brought our own booster seat as they have no high chairs.)Among the three of us drinking, we tried five of the beers and enjoyed them all. The gnocchi was excellent as was the side of spinach. We will definitely take visitors here - even if just for a drink and appetizer as the view and service were both excellent.

Our parents were visiting Singapore, so we wanted to make a reservation at a spot that had great views, solid food, and could appease the craft brew lovers in our group. We were not looking for anything spectacular, but we were counting on something solid. While LeVeL 33 gave an attempted, it just fell short in about every department.First off, I made reservations weeks in advance asking for a table for 5 with a view. Although, I know that can be difficult, I was hoping for at least a partial view. Instead, we were seated in a back corner with no view. At all. The beer was nothing amazing, but drinkable. The food was average at best. No one in our group was all that happy with their selection, but could eat it. While, I cannot say anything negative (beyond the seating situation) about this restaurant, sadly I struggle to find positives too. All in all, LeVeL33 tries to be more, but it is just average and maybe not even that
5
Whatever I can say about the view will not be enough. Please go and check by yourself. Besides, finger food and drinks are very good and not crazy expensive. Service was quite satisfactory and quick. My only advice is to book in advance one of the tables outside, it makes a difference
5
Traveling to Singapore? Looking for a place that will give you the best view, the best micro-brewery beer and great atmosphere... look no further. Level 33 is quite perfectly placed to give you the best view of Marina Bay, which includes stunning views of the financial district, the water, Singapore and you can catch again and again the Marina Bay Sands light show. Be sure to make reservations in advance and ask for Terrace seating so you will be seated outside with the front row view and the cool Singapore evening breeze. Service is great, can be romantic or a good place to begin your evening with drinks before heading out. Love this spot and will continue to visit - take my advise and make it happen, you wont regret it
4
Perfect date night. View was great. Staff where all attentive and make a simple evening felt extraordinary. Tenderloin steak was grilled to perfection. Pale Ale is a must try. Will definitely go back again for the experience. Will have given 5stars if there wasnt alot of 'tourists' snapping selfie throughout the night blocking the view. But we still got out fair share of the view arrange by the staff.
4
This place is really nice to have a look around the bay. But you have to go there in good weather, othervise the outer place is closed, so you cannot see that much.They have special beers, taste them! :) Otherwise it is expensive.Worth to book a table in advance, it is crowded
4
If you wanna find the higher place to see Marina Bay view with special dinner, i suggest Level 33. Good food and nice view.
5
The ambience with fresh beer brewing, the service staff are professional and friendly, the quality of food! You must make a reservation. If its not raining and you like some wind (mind you not breeze), then outside seating is great.
4
We went there for bites and drinks but all tables have been reserved, but when we said for dinner, they gave us a table immediately.
Very nice view of Marina Bay, especially during sunset .
Food was average.
Worth to visit for an experience.
5
Good value meals.
Ploughman table not impressive, but good enough for the price we pay.
Window seat can be a bit warm at lunch time. Tinted glass would be great too!
5
So, we were in Singapore for only 9 nights but managed to squeeze in 2 visits to LeVeL 33. Definitely not the cheapest place to eat but should be on your 'places to visit in Singapore' list. On our first visit we met a friend, sat outside with beer and bar snacks. An amazing view, with great beer and the bar snacks so yummy could have eaten more.Our second visit was with the friends we were staying with, because we'd been so impressed on our first visit. This time we sat inside and ate off the 'A la Carte' menu. We had beer to start but moved onto wine. The food was as amazing as our first visit. T-bone steak to share cooked to perfection and the gnocchi with pulled lamb was superb. Could not fault it. Once we had finished eating we asked if we could move to an outside table and just sat, chatted and enjoyed the view. The staff were very helpful, gave great advice and attentive. Could not recommend highly enough. It is most definitely worth a visit.
2
The food quality has dropped since my last visit but it is still acceptable. The heavy wheat smell is the main factor in my low review. They have an in-house brewery which they chose to start maintaining it during lunch hour. They started brewing the wheat which emitted a very strong smell that is nauseating. I asked the server if they always do this and their reply to me is pretty rude. She said they have to brew their beer everyday so they don't really bother about the smell impacting the guests. Perhaps it is my sensitive nose, but the persistent smell really ruins my appetite. I will definitely not go there again.
5
Level33 sits high above Marina Bay, offering an unobstructed, panoramic view across Marina Bay. Their onsite brewery means their brews are fresh and tasty. It's a great place for a special occasion, Sunday brunch, or drinks with friends. Watch the price tags though, it can add up fast. Portions are not large, but still quite generous. You'll probably want an appetizer to go with your main course. Try the beef tatare as an appetizer. Or if you're having trouble deciding on your dish, ask one of the waitstaff - they are more than happy to offer suggestions or help you decide in the face of your indecision since everything looks so good.
5
I went in for a beer and stayed for dinner and a heap of beers.I highly recommend the soft shell crab and the sizzling beef. So tasty.Best view in Singapore overlooking the Marina Bay Sands Hotel and back over the financial centre of Singapore.I am usually not a craft beer fan but I really enjoyed the lager and Indian pale ale.Great service, great food, great service. Highly recommended restaurant in Singapore
5
Came back again, after my last lunch/business dinner visit at this fabulous establishment.Wanted to make a booking, but when we arrived it was raining, unfortunately.Therefore the staff has offered us a table inside for dinner or id we want to sit at the lounge/bar place. We happened to talk with one of the staff and have been reccommended a sparkling red wine (think was a shiraz) from him as we were searching for something special for our anniversary. Truly speaking an amazing wine!!! Unbeatable.Afterward it has stopped raining and we have been asked if we wanna have our table outside now, and we tried the cold cut platter with italian meats which was okay as well.As we were still hungry we have ordered the lamb banjo, which is absolutely worth the waiting.All in all was again an amazing experience and especially the staff seems very friendly to me, so i somehow cant understand the complaints about their service and their beer (which is for me the second best in town (i am a kronenburg fan :)) ) Will definitely be back agai

If your looking for a place that combines great food with stunning views, this is the place to be. The view from the open air terrace is absolutely breathtaking. At LeVel 33 you have a great overview of the Marina Bay with its most striking feature being the Marina Bay Sands hotel. We went there for drinks and dinner at 6pm so we could enjoy the dusk setting in. Seeing all the lights appearing on the sky scrapers was magnificent.LeVel 33 brews its own beer. You can see the large stainless steel containers where the beer is brewed. Very nice touch. The interior is very welcoming with a friendly staff. If you're a beer lover you might like the beer tasting platter, which offers you the possibility to taste all the different beers they brew.The food on the menu is European style. We (4 persons) ordered two main courses and a lot of side dishes so we could share and taste everything. The food was delicious. Really great with some inventive combinations of ingredients. The desserts were a perfect finish for a lovely evening. Loved it!Would definitely go back here
5
The view and ambiance is hard to beat..the beers and service are great with the staff always willing to take group photographs perfectly!
LeVel 33 is our no1 destination when we have visitors in town...
5
The venue is great with a fantastic view of harbour.The food was great and the staff were most friendly.Went there a second night during my stay.The price was ok by Singapore standards as food quality and choice was excellent.
1
Awful service, our table was completely forgotten due to staff attending to 'event'. Food took ages and was average quality yet premium price.
5
How much fun was this! It was a bit windy when we were up there but I loved taking the elevator up and then having a good IPA on the patio. We didn't eat--just sipped and enjoyed the view.
1
We went to this restaurant for dinner with a group of family and friends visiting us in Singapore. I am not sure if it is a new owner, but the service was pushy and not professional. The expensive steaks came out over cooked and were not seasoned well. The beer was not up to previous standards and the sampler paddle only had one beer worth reordering. If you are looking for a view while dining or drinking in Singapore there are much better options than suffering through bad food and service at this restaurant
2
This place does live up to the expectation of their view but not all of the tables can take advantage of it. So even their best selling point is mixed and depends on where you are lucky enough to be seated. The beer was terribly disappointing. It is the least flavorful of any of the local Singapore microbreweries that I've been to and none of the other places charge $20 for a pint. Add the below average service to both of these points and I think there are many other options in Singapore to dine / have a drink with a view
4
A must do while in Singapore. Level 33 offers a good range of craft beers, cocktails and wine. Didn't eat here but the menu looked ok. We went for drinks after dinner and the view is amazing. Just a tip, book even if just found for drinks. We went in a Monday night and the good table are all reserved
4
Treated my best friend from overseas to dine with a fantastic view of the Singapore skyline with Marina Bay Sands in focus. The food taste great of fine dining standards. The qualms was the portion of the food - that it can be bigger. We've asked for plain water but was instead offered an S$8.50 bottle of Pellegrino. It's quite a sneaky move but as a good host I didn't question further - but please check in with them if they serve tap water. Overall, a great ambience, great food, fresh beers, reasonable value and a sight to behold
5
If you want one of the best roof top views in Singapore, then you cannot go past Level 33. We went on Sunday as a family for lunch as we had overseas guests with us and the staff did not miss a trick (service here is always very good). We had the lamb shoulder for 4 and it was to die for. Succulent and full of flavour. The best part is the fact the beers are brewed onsite and they really compliment the food.Once place worth visiting when in Singapore. 
4
I live 50m away and enjoy the place - having visited on several occasions - lunch / dinner / drinks only.You won't go far wrong.Run by mainly Filipino staff who are attentiveI tried to book solid ( as did colleague ) for several days - not answer - no return calls - no nothing - day / night anytime.In the end I just waled over and bookedDon't go if it raining 
5
One of few restaurants where the great view matches the good food. Great range of home brewed beers as well though I am not a beer drinker.
5
I frequent this restaurant and was never disappointed each time I visit. Excellent view of the Marina area. The craft beers brewed in house taste great. I find the weekday executive lunch a very good deal.
4
View is amazing here, perfect place to go have drinks on the patio. food is ok...typical brewery type food for lunch and good value with the buffet appetiser option! Dinner though is a bit pricey (it is singapore though)!
5
Night time views just awesome taking in the laser light show from the Marina Sands & the many other spectacular & multi coloured sights & lights.
The macro brewery not exactly cheap but well worth it to take in the experience.
5
Went along with a friend today for the set lunch - clever marketing - it costs $33 ++ - starters are a buffet style with great salads, large fresh prawns, smoked salmon, cheeses, pasta - really it's more than enough for lunch, but the 33 includes main course - good choices of risotto, burgers, steak sandwiches and fabulous fish and chips! All the mains were delicious and substantial portions. You can add on a dessert or go back to the buffet to help yourself to cakes, pastries and cheese. Tea and coffee is an extra $6 but they're more than happy to provide iced water free of charge (no hard sell of bottled water :) ) - the service was excellent - glasses quickly refilled and plates cleared. Lovely busy surroundings and amazing views of Marina Bay, we were really impressed - great bargain and excellent quality.Can;t wait to return
5
Fantastic location, and fantastic views all round! Perfect place to unwind and relax after a hard day. Mind you these things are possible only on weekdays, it's completely jam packed on weekends. The brews are really really good, try the Wheat! Nothing much to choose from to eat though, just short eats, although the bread and dips was wonderful. Fresh baked bread with three dips to choose from, very nice. Would recommend this place to anyone looking for a relaxed evening, again, mind you, it's not the same on weekends..
5
I took my wife here for her birthday as was not disappointed. Great food, attentive service, beautiful views, all combined to make a magical night.For me the best dish was the Scallop entree, the best I have had in my life, and my wife's gnocchi was out of this world!When I mentioned in passing it was my wife's birthday over the phone (when they reconfirmed the reservation) I was not expecting anything extra from them. However they made sure to put us at a table with one of the best views, they put a happy birthday message and a candle on our desert, and as we left everyone at the maître d's desk wished her a happy birthday! Absolutely spectacular service
4
Great view over Marina bay. We sat outside and had a nice evening in the tropical weather. Meat and brewery-beer was really good. The only part we did not like so much was starter carpacchio (tasted fish) and that several new people came to take pictures between our table and the view - they where a bit to close to our dining. To sit outside we had to order for at least 60 dollar each to get a table, which we easaly did - a bit pricy here... We paid 420 for 3 persons. Overall a memorable evening
3
Great view across parts of Marina Bay and over the Malacca Straits. Well set our restaurant and well decorated in a modern but undramatic style.We had the set lunch and chose the fish& chips - how boring we hear you say but it is one of LeVeL's signature dishes. Nice fish and well cooked but not a 5. Plus the entrée buffet and the dessert buffet were a bit ordinary in our view.Enjoyable but not exciting
3
Came here for dinner and sat by the window. The view was spectacular and the restaurant is rather unique in a sense that its the highest urban craft brewery in the world. The food was decent, not bad but not amazing.Asked staff to take a photo for us outside and he replied us with a yes but never came around to actually doing it, service was a bit of a let down. With this kind of view, the staff should have been a bit more proactive in asking as they knew we wanted to take a photo
4
Dined at Level 33 for Sunday lunch with visiting relative last weekend. Thoroughly enjoyed the day with great food, service, views and ambience. A must when hosting visitors.
3
View was lovely. Meal very average. We had the Sunday roast, my husband had the roast beef, which was good enough. I had the roast lamb which was tough and chewy. The potatoes and vegetables on both plates were overdone. From ordering our meal to being served it took a few minutes short of one hour. We complained at the time and one meal was removed from the bill. Service was quite good
3
Went there on a recommendation (because of the view). IPA was tasty, cold and prices were on par with neighboring restaurants, if not a bit on the high side. View is incredible and once seated, the service was good. One note; we arrived around 4 or 5 on a Friday afternoon and there were several open tables on the patio (probably 2 open out of 20 or so?). We were greeted promptly and asked to wait to the side while a table was prepared. No-one came back for 5 minutes or so until we flagged down a server and they apologized and sat us promptly. Not an issue, but I would imagine they get by primarily on the view and not service or beer/food quality, so go into it with this in mind
5
Excellent view!! ....tried this place on a Saturday lunch time and sat on the balcony. Had a very good pale ale and was not going to eat as the menu was only Brunch and a little limited for 1pm but ended up choosing the pea & ham soup with a poached egg. After reading some of the comments I did not expect much but this was delicious! The service was friendly and attentive
3
worth going for a quick drink for the view of the marina. i went around 3pm on a friday, had no problem finding a table on the terrace but the food menu was somewhat limited so ended up just getting drinks. would of been nice if the steak tartare was on offer all day... the IPA is okay (a bit weak for my liking), the white beer is very good. nice atmosphere and friendly staff. remember to check out the video by the lift on the 1st floor of how they got the brewery into the building
5
Despite all the reviews I have seen over the last few days and weeks, I have went here first for a trial lunch with my wife on a monday lunch, and have been quite impressed with the offers that they give you for lunch. It was 33 SGD including a buffet spread and a main course, which was absolutely outstanding. My Wife has had the Cheese which was quite hard to understand in the menu but amazing to eat.After the trial lunch we have decided to bring some business guest from Germany over. The manager, (an austrian guy) which we have met at the lunch has explained us how dinner usually is quite a different experience from their lunch, and normally the best experience for business guest. So we have decided to bring them over as the lunch was just perfect food combined with awesome service.Honestly, my business partners are still telling me about the experience they have had at level33, as they have simply loved the food and have been very amazed by the service which has been more than outstanding as they even have managed to accompany us (8 people)on the beautiful terrace for after dinner drinks, which has led to a very nice evening with a couple of drinks. The staff have been very attentive and have tried their best to accompany every wish we have had. Definitely coming back here as soon as I have the time and the pocket money ;
1
Eat before or after, have a sip of the cheapest beer, enjoy the view and leave. I think this sums up my recommendation to others. The food was tasteless and chivvy. The lamb you had to look for between all the disgusting "potato pasta". The beer was certainly not worth the money.Dress code: Business casual. Fact: Slippers, shorts, babies. I am certainly never going to recommend this place to anyone - even though I am based in a neighbor building.

This was my first stop in Singapore and I'm grateful that Lonely Planet highlighted Level 33. Even as a solo traveler out around 8pm, I felt quite welcomed and at ease at Level 33. The service was excellent. I started at a high-top that had a nice view out over the terrace which overlooks the famed Marina Bay Sands(MBS). As patrons thinned out the server asked me if I wanted to move outside to a high top table there. Of course I was happy to.The beer was excellent. Not cheap mind you, but welcome to Singapore, oh, and you get a very neat view. For food I stuck with the Fat Chips and the beer infused ketchup that comes with. It was an excellent small platter to pair off with the beers. My choice beer was the Bohemian Pilsner which is a special at the moment.The crowd on a Wednesday night were clearly from the Financial District. Lots of loosened ties and rolled up sleeves were around. To arrive at Level 33, I came from the Raffles Quay MRT stop and more or less just followed my novice instincts to the signs pointing towards Marina Residences (or something close to that). You won't be off course. You can walk underground to the Tower One which is home of Level 33 entirely underground too (I did that the following day when I realized I left my credit card at the bar when holding my tab).Definitely dedicate a meal or a few rounds to Level 33. I was happy this was first venue to explore the city from above and get a sense of where I would plot my exploring for the next day
1
I went here for the set lunch with my colleague today. The food was ok, but the service was atrocious. We were seated but then left for about 10 minutes before anyone asked if we wanted a drink. The self-service buffet starter was ok, but some of the dishes were almost run out, and were not replenished for the entire time we were there (from 1pm to 2.30pm). The main course took approximately 45 minutes to arrive, which was way too long. I asked for ketchup with my fish & chips, and the waitress took about 10 minutes to bring me "ketchup", which was actually chilli sauce. I then had to ask again, and wait another 5 minutes for actual ketchup, by which time I had finished my meal. The "cheese board" was COMPLETELY empty (this was supposed to form part of the "buffet dessert". It was completely empty for the entire time we were sat there. I finally pointed this out to the "Service Director", a Dutch man, who agreed that it was not really acceptable, but still did not do anything about it. We had to wait about 30 minutes to have our dirty plates cleared, and then it was only because I asked.Eventually I spoke to the "Service Director" again and complained, and asked if we could have a discount on our bill (suggesting 10%). He said a flat "no" but offered us a free coffee. We said ok. He then brought the bill, which included "service charge"(!!) My male colleague complained to him about this, and said we would like it removed from the bill, given the lack of "service" and the general bad experience we'd had. At this point the "Service Director" became quite obnoxious, and pointedly directed his unpleasant response at me, not my male colleague. I found this unprofessional and sexist - why was he talking to me and not my colleague? He had a real go at me and said if he were to remove the service charge, then he would have to charge us for the coffees! It was unbelievable, he was quite angry with me, and it showed. He said that the service charge was listed in the menu, so we had to pay it, and he pointed out that the restaurant does not promise to deliver "service" anywhere in exchange for the service charge, which was really childish and ridiculous.I will never, never go back to this place - it is the worst experience I have had in Singapore
4
A very nice restaurant specializing in beers (microbrewery on site), famous for it great views over the marina. These restaurants are normally not famous for their food, but it actually is quite good here. It is just (like a lot of places in Singapore) very, very busy and difficult to have a conversation while eating
4
The view could not be nicer; straight over the Marina Bay. You can have a couple of drinks and there after a good dinner. To my regret the choice was not that much of an Asian, rather Western. A must visit, anyway
4
LeVel 33 provides a nice view of the city's skyline, especially if one is dining in the dark! Food was pretty yummy, service too was good. The photo was a pleasant surprise and a sweet touch to the dinner! Would recommend for those who craves for some privacy, personalized service and a nice ambience :)

After reading great reviews, we decided to spend our anniversary at Level 33.I called at the very last minute, and from the time I called until the time we left,our experience was one of the best we've ever had. (I wish I could remember the girls name who took the call. She was extremely nice. I think I was Abbey?)"Ming" - (Our Server) along with "Emelda" -( Assistant Mgr), were professional, courteous,and their customer service was nothing short of outstanding. They went out of their way to make sure everything was perfect. Even when we tried to give "Ming" a tip, his exact response was "No thank you, I love what I do". You simply never, ever, hear that from anyone. Lets also not forget the food, drinks, and atmosphere were outstanding as well. :)Thank you for a fantastic, unforgettable anniversary
5
met an ex work colleague at level 33 and was impressed from the moment I walked in, the service was excellent and the host and the manager were very accommodating given that we are hard customers to please. The food was delicious and fresh and took no time at all to come out. Food prices are also very reasonable for the amazing view over marina bay. Good selection of wines and other spirits, cheese platter and dips and bread also very nice. We wanted some items that weren't available till 3pm but the manger took care of us the whole time. I will be definitely coming back here whenever I'm in Singapore next. I think it would be great at night.
2
We went for lunch today. The buffet selection was quite limited and poor quality. We ordered burger and chips for main and we didnt finished the meal. Its so tastless and boring and the ingredients look not fresh; they look old. We noticed that many of our neigbouring tables have their left main meal. The two stars are for the spectacular view and private lift access to the restaurant.
4
Food consistently good, which it should be, for the decent prices - but great view, lovely staff, and the only whinge I had, was my food was not hot enough.... also, its a big place - why pack people in next to each other - obviously for staff convenience - but didnt really want to be sat next to a larger noisy group, when there was plenty of other space to seat people..
5
I arranged a birthday meal at Level 33 for my fiancÃ© and 10 guests. Two days later, he is still talking about what an amazing time he had. Everyone could agree that the food was absolutely delicious, particularly the giant prawns. The servings looked small, but were very filling. The views were stunning, allowing for some nice photo opportunities. Highly recommended
5
Don't miss spectacular views of the central business district [CBD] and Marina Bay Sands [MBS] while enjoying a cool drink, savory meal or snack! The staff is refreshingly responsive to people's needs .... getting a seat with a view, refilling your glass or delivering the food
4
Husband and I are big fans of craft beer, and we enjoyed the selection here. We came for Saturday lunchtime, and sat on the terrace. The views are very nice indeed. Service was friendly and attentive. We ordered the steak sandwich from the brunch menu (bar snacks only begin at 3pm). It was cooked as we requested and was very nicely flavoured. Our one negative was that there were only three (admittedly thick cut) chips... Which were too tasty to only have three of

Level 33 has to be great location to have a sunday lunch, especially if you want to have a western roast meal with homemade beers. Being in the CBD area means that on weekends, the restaurant is not as busy around 12pm but you should always make a reservation in advance. Food wise, you get a hearty roast portion, especially if you get the chicken, but the roast beef does come with a large yorkshire pudding which looks amazing (although my mum says some extra gravy would have been good to have on the side). When the place got busy though, getting service was a slight. A few times we were forgotten about and when we did catch someone's eye, they said they will be back but never came back. Small gripe, but that knocked it down to 4/5 for me

Had drinks with friends. Spectacular view that costs nothing but you indeed pay for it with drinks prices. But, hey.. you're in Singapore.

On our last visit to Singapore in Dec 2014, we meet 1 of our friends here at level 33.Very easy to get to, just ask taxi driver to take you to MBFC (Marina Bay Financial Centre) and easy to find on weekdays but ask security on weekends for directions to lift.Upon arrival we were greeted with a nice smile and taken to a table outside and quickly given a quick run down of how things worked. Ordered drinks quickly and sat back and enjoyed the company and the view. After a couple of fine bevy's we watched a great tropical storm roll in and we quickly moved inside when it started to rain cats and dogs!Food menus were then quickly read and a variety of food was ordered....mmmm very nice it was indeed and 2nd's was ordered.Overall a great place to visit and look up their websit for special breakfasts, brunches and weekend lunches

We got the staff to check the voucher we had and she took ages to come back to us. Saw her going around serving other people instead.Complimentary bread was mediocre. We had the scallops and foie gras as appetisers and there were really good. We selected cod fish and pork tenderloin for mains and they were rather disappointing. Cod fish was fresh but no wow factor. Pork tenderloin taste OK but rather funky texture. For desserts, we had chocolate molten cake that was decent and cheese. There are 4 generous cheeses in the platter, completed with some fruits and spicy biscuit (that doesn't go well with the cheeses to me).Before we start our desserts, the staff offered and moved us to the outside seats. I like this part a lot as we get to chill and enjoy the view. Worth a try
5
We visited on a Sunday and enjoyed the brunch. Our group tried each of the meat selections and all were great. We also tried several of the microbrews on tap and they were wonderful as well. A little hard to find as it is in what looks like to be an office building
5
Had heard a few grumbles about this bar - queues excessive and snotty staff - but we didnt experience any problems on our Wednesday visit and found the staff extremely helpful despite our lack of booking. Stunning views and a surprisingly relaxed atmosphere, we didnt have an outdoor table but it was easy to get outside and experience the views. Nice to see children welcomed as well.Had some really nice bar food and prices, while expensive as you would expect, certainly weren't excessive, so I would highly recommen
3
my title of the review sums it up. its just for the view. The drink and dinner are overpriced. The food is mediocre for the price you pay. Its a great place to go for a drink (dont have to get their micro/local brew, its nothing to rant about) any drink will do, enjoy the view and then get out. I wouldn't mind paying the money if the food would justifyfor it.Drinks are overpriced for what it is
5
My friend took me here calling Level 33 the Best Bar in Singapore. We got there early (5:30) and snagged an outdoor table looking out the the ocean. The breeze made it delightful. The view captivating and the perfect place to watch the light show at Gardens by the Bay. The seasonal craft beers are a huge draw and delicious. The wine list is limited, but adequate. After a few glasses of beer and wine we decided food was required. The beef cubes with garlic and chicken drummies hit the spot. My friend and I fought over the garlic that came with the beef. Maybe this could be another appetizier?
5
A beautiful sight from the hotel overlooking the Promenade, merlion, marina bay sands. its a treat to visit this hotel at night and a great place for families too. i did see some families with kids but not exactly a kids place. The snacks were good and so was the beer straight from the tap. Godd range of beers and choice of cocktails/ mock tails. Be there by abt 7pm in the evening in case u dont want to miss the laser show of merlion from there. View is great and great place to hangout with friends. The smoking zone is outside so its kinda cool. Dont miss it in Singapore for all travelers
4
Went here with several friends back in December. The views of Singapore's Marina Bay and the lights at Gardens on the Bay. It's a craft brewery on the 33rd floor. All the beers we tasted were very good. Our sit-down meal was a little pricey and just okay, my steak was rarer than I ordered. If in Singapore, go for the beer and view, but eat elsewhere
3
I chose this restaurant of reading a recent review of the place in a magazine which praised the set lunch, so I took a friend. The views are spectacular and the micro-brewery is fun, but the food was a let down. The lunch is a sideboard of salads that individually looked ok but when placed on a single plate looked like a big mess of various mayonnaises that seemed to smother them. The quality of the cheese and charcuterie reminded me of breakfast at a businessman's hotel - mass produced and pretty unappetising, along with prawns and smoked salmon of equally insipidness. I then paid up for the Osso Bucco which came as a lump of slimy meat without an sign of an osso. its was slathered in an overpowering tomato sauce and was pretty unpleasant. I really wanted to like this place but the food needs seriously upgrading. The other lunch options were fish and chips and a burger - pub grub. This is no culinary experience so just go for the beer
4
Great micro brewery serving delicious ales. Great open style outside bar with views out over the marina and business district.
Good restaurant inside.
5
A great chillax rooftop bar to unwind your day's work away! Fantastic view! No posers, just relax! Definitely my new hangout plc!
5
The executive lunch set was a steal! Selection of the appetiser/dessert buffet table was great. Totally worth the price.
2
On this occasion, it appears that any form of customer service training and development has missed by the staff. My family were visiting from the UK and specifically booked this place to sample the produce from the microbrewery. We were informed we could not have a tasting paddle of their signature beers as 'there aren't enough glasses' and could expect to wait 45 mins for this. The restaurant was half full. When it was pointed out that there were empty paddles on nearby tables, the waiter shrugged and walked off. Another table arrived shortly after us, ordered and about 5 mins later their drinks arrived - with the beer selection paddle. Upon mentioning this to the waiter, he quipped 'they must've found some'. So ridiculous, it's almost laughable. Wouldn't have minded so much if it weren't for the fact I had specifically taken family there for this very experience.
4
Having read various and differing opinions about the place, we decided to have dinner there on our fist evening in Singapore. A very good idea beacuse Level 33 is an excellent place to start a short stay (5 days) in Singapore around New years Eve. We had a cocktail on the terrasse which offers a breathtaking view of the Maria Bay surroudings,for us the best after having seen the bay from places all around itBecause of heavy rain we had to move Inside after 15 minutes. The service is friendly and efficient, the wines (White from New Zeeland of course) excellent and not exagerately expensive. The portions were not to large and not to small.Timbale fo crab and pan-seared scallops, delicious,and after that Beef and Reef (the local equivalent of Surf & Turf) very tender and well seasoned. Everything was tasty and fresh, not haute cuisine but close to it indeed. An excellent place that I recomend without a doubt
4
Food was pretty good with an awesome view but was hesitant at first bringing my 2 month old baby to the restaurant but the staff were helpful finding a good location to place my pram with us while eating. And realised 3 other families also came with infants and helpful staff provided hot water to warm the feed. Family friendly and would return again.
4
We went here for a family dinner - excellent atmosphere and great service. Beer was good as well. Reservations in advance was smooth - they even made a note and remembered to call us as we had requested a change of timing for our dinner. But at the time of booking the restaurant was full at the time we wanted to eat.We had 2 fish dishes and 2 meat dishes - all tasted great. As did the beer paddle. We were offered to move outside for our desserts, they prioritized restaurant guests over walk-in bar guests. Excellent service. Desserts - the chefs tasting desert was not very good - but the chocolate fondants were excellent. Prices are bit on the higher side - but you must expect to pay for the location. No kids menu and no offer to sell half portions from the regular menu - a bit disappointing. The kids were offered to order from the regular bar / snacks menu. Location is great by the way. We will come back.I have been there for a weekday lunch as well - then they offer very good value for money from my experience

After a fabulous lunch experience at LeVel 33 some months back, I decided to return here for dinner and drinks - for the magnificent views and freshly brewed craft beers. After all, *Fay and hubby were in town, and it was the Christmas season.For food, we had a Seafood Medley (SGD$88.00) for sharing - a selection of pickled, marinated, cured and smoked seafood with caper berries and sauce tartare. The array of smoked salmon, prawns and squids were tasty, though the smoked salmon was a little on the salty side. The squids were juicy and chewy and plump the way I love them.We also ordered a Gnocchi (SGD$39.00) as well, since there were 5 of us - slow braised shredded lamb shoulder, potato pasta, pine nuts, cranberry, red wine jus, goat cheese and sage. The potato pasta was sticky like glutinous rice balls, but lighter in texture, with a more powdery interior. The shredded lamb strips were most delicious in taste, and complements the potato pasta extremely well.For full review and more photographs, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/12/dinner-at-level-33-mbfc-tower-1-revisit.htm

I've been to LeVel 33 a few times. It's always been calm and relaxed and never too busy. It's a restaurant, sure - but it's also a micro brewery and therefore a place to buy good beer. This visit was slightly marred by a few families with kids, allowed to wander up to the restaurant buffet and grab food when they liked...generally make a lot of noise and play around. Kids are allowed to play, of course. But it wasn't the experience I was hoping for while enjoying a beer at a stylish micro brewery. I guess I will avoid it at holiday time from now on
4
Food is superb especially the veal. The selection of beer and cocktail are interesting too. I would have wanted to try the chestnut beer but it was not available at the time I went there. Nevertheless the beer we ordered were just as good and interesting. The view is also good. The place was busy when we went there but at least not that cramped or too crowded. Glad that we had the chance to be seated outside
5
Reservations were spot on for us celebrating a birthday dinner. We were given a prime table with a great view of Marina Bay. The food was great and a special desert was served. The entire staff was very friendly and we will definitely be back.
5
The view, the atmosphere, the beer but most importantly is the food. Woo my wife and I thought we were in heaven. The chef and manager is a true genius. Thank you for opening our eyes and tantalising our sensors. Being from Melbourne Australia we are extremely spoilt when it comes to food and good restaurants. But this experience truly blew us away. Please do yourself a favour whenever you are in Singapore do give it a visit. You may need to book first but go for it
4
What an amazing place. The set-up, the location with a stunning view if you are on the terrace. We where happy with the food and especially the beer and a fantastic atmosphere. The only drawback could be that you don't get a seat if you don't have a reservation. However when we came 5 of us without a reservation and on a Friday the staff was very helpful and found a table albeit inside.Would I come back? Definitely
5
Went for an evening meal here with a friend. The beer is very good with a good selection. The food was well presented and tasty (and reasonably priced for the circumstances). The view over the marina is also stunning and this alone is reason enough to visit this restaurant. Would highly recommend
2
It is a great location, indeed. Superb views over Marina Bay and much of Singapore. Food is very disappointing though. My dining partner had Ocean Trout, which tasted muddy and stale. I tried Back & Belly, which is meant to be a 140g sirloin and 100g of slow-cooked brisket, but the sirloin was all senewy and the brisket was drenched in a very salty sauce (au jus?) and had many fatty parts throughout. When I choose for that, I'll order wagyu with high marbling. Service is OK, but little attention or follow-up when we shared our opinion about the food. Go there for a nice beer, which is said to be made on premise. Possibly try some of the bar menu snacks, but skip the restaurant food, or at least the dishes we had
4
Make reservations for 2pax on Thursday evening and surprised was allocated a window view. Ordered dessert rate 3/5 for taste n 4/5 for presentation.Craft beer was really good.Lastly there was a heavy downpour yet the night sky cleared up and again we were glad our last minute for an outdoor table seats were available. Excellent NIGHT view and fantastic night with my gal pal friend! 
5
We stopped in for a long, sumptuous luncheon at LeVeL 33 and walked out very, very satisfied! LeVeL 33's panoramic view of Marina Bay is simply astonishing. Of course, it's not enough for a restaurant to look good; the kitchen must have the skill to back it up. Fortunately, head chef Jimi Tegerdine has culinary talent in spades! Every appetizer was perfectly balanced, from the crispy duck confit with pumpkin & anise oil to the sausage raviolacci with spicy chorizo & lamb bacon. Jimi is a true original who loves to play with diners' palates - who else could devise venison carpaccio with avocado emulsion and edamame pesto? Our mains were more 'traditional' but no less scrumptious: heaps and heaps of beef rib with Yorkshire pudding, turkey with pork stuffing brined in pale ale, crackling pig with roast vegetables, and lamb leg with duck fat potatoes .... deliciously decadent! If you're looking for a phenomenal meal in Singapore with a view to match, it's tough to top LeVeL 33.Amazing
4
Had a fantastic time at Level 33 and food was excellent and atomosphere wasbeyond expectation although we were a little surprised by the portion of theside dishes that came out more than we had expected. Waiters seemed short-handed as it was a bit difficult to get their attention for extra order.Overall if you want to see enjoy and feel Singapore landscape, definitely recommend for both business and pleasure.
4
Level 33 is a relaxed dining venue with great ambiance and excellent food, wine, craft beer and a breathtaking view. The staff are welcoming and will do their best to find you a table outside, the meals are well price for Singapore and particularly so when you factor in what the view would cost you in many other spots around town. Highly enjoyable, definitely returning.
5
Went here for after lunch drinks with my husband and friends, the view is amazing! I had the mojito and it was good, they are using dark rum though, so if you prefer cachaca, you should let them know. Beers were reasonably priced for Singapore and the view. I recommend seating outside. It is really nice. Staff were attentive and friendly too
5
Most amazing view in Singapore. This has better view than from kudeta at MBS. The cool breeze, the stunning views, the beer, the crowd. Go there if you want to relax after long day at work and feel the difference
4
Stunning views, cool breeze, lovely beer. Amazing experience and a place to be if you are looking to have a cool beer while having sweeping views of Singapore skyline
1
Great view, but expensive and a stuck up dishonest manager let this place down. I would not recommend this place
4
the food is nice, the meat was really tender. not too pricey drinks & an attentive sevice. try the dessert "the Dates" which is a sticky dip pudding with Bourbon infused caramel. offers a fantastic panoramic view of the Singapore skyline. the scenic view alone is enough for me to come back. stay for the sunset as you get to see both the day & night view
5
Came here for late birthday drinks with close friends. Only had beer food - all delicious, bread and steak and all. Our waiter (Azri) was very helpful and friendly. View is undoubtedly amazing. I was a visitor - but saw a lot of locals that seem to work around the area - felt even more comfortable as it was a nice bar, but not the type who requires you to dress your best.The place is veryy crowded, naturally. So make sure to plan your trip here.. otherwise you can get lucky and get a seat in the smoking area, which doesn't require queue-ing
5
I have visited Singapore for business purpose last weekend and was recommended to come to LEvel 33 by my business partner! I actually had difficulties to get a table by making a reservation as they seems really busy on weekends. When I arrived there, the table was not really good, as I was alone they gave me corner table, no view... After the foreign manager approached me and starting from there, my experience in Level 33 turned into a great time! He was really passionate and kindly engaging to ensure I would have a good experience in his restaurant... Service was perfect to make it short! they gave me a better table afterwards as occupancy didn't allow from beginnig but they indeed did their best... Food was excellent and environment is also really well done!Highly recommended!!!
5
In the beginning I was not sure whether I should visit Level 33 as the reviews have been very mixed. However I decided to got here with my friend and have been wowed throughout the entire evening. We received a very warm welcome by the staffs who have been very friendly and attentive in general. We ordered the beefn reef and a steak and shared the food - Amazing! Meat and seafood have been from high quality and grilled on the spot. Not to mention their incredible beer selection. The manager passed by a couple of times and gave us an Austrian schnaps which we then enjoyed on the terrace which offers an impeccable view over marina bay.Thank you for this wonderful evening
4
My husband and I booked for Sunday lunch at 2pm, and arrived to a warm welcome and great views. We both picked the Roast Beef with trimmings and the carrot & swede side dish with a glass of wine each and finished with dessert and coffees.Good points: food well cooked, tasty, and nicely presented, nice wines by the glassCould do better on: [1] explaining how long the roast would take to arrive (we waited nearly an hour and there was no explanation...we might have ordered a platter/starter if we had known) [2] heating the dinner plates - in the air-conditioned restaurant the food cooled quite quickly and it was disappointing that the kitchen had not warmed the dinner plates [3] lattes were delivered in small cappuccino size cups (again, not pre-warmed).Just small adjustments could take this establishment to a 5 Star rating.I am keen to dine there again (with visitors from out of town), and see how the drinks & bar snacks service compares
5
Middle of last week I got the chance to experience level 33 in Singapore due to a 12 hour layover in this amazing city! A friendly recommendation of a customer care employee from Singapore airlines was suggesting me to have a look around in the Marina Bay Area, since it was convenient to reach with in around 30 minutes....whole story short, the taxi driver suggested me level 33 and dropped me there. He did not promise to much, the view on this sunny and blue sky day was just amazing and gave me the chance to oversee the Bay area. Seated on the outside terrace enjoying hot weather and sunshine was great, on top of this the restaurant came up with some well brewed craft beer. Service was attentive and has shown care since I seated by myself I got offered a Newspaper for me to read (you really donÂ´t need it when you are having this view) overall the staff seem to be well trained.Food benefits from the view. I can recommend this place to everyone traveling to Singapore, not only for the view but also for its service and beer
4
We went for some happy hour beers and munchies. This place brews and serves only their own beer. After trying every beer they brew I was a bit let down. The ipa was but too mild for my taste. The lager was ok but lacked depth of flavor. The white beer was not a typical or good for that matter white beer. I'm not a stout drinker so I didn't try it. We ordered a portion of their chunky chips which looked absolutely fantastic but lacked flavor. Service was absolutely fantastic. Ambiance was nice and the view is simply indescribable.
5
Went there for dinner, had amazing lamb. Own beer breed there which was very good. Views over Marina bay and city
5
Service and ambient was fantastic. I will definitely oay my visit again. I highly recommrnded this place.thank you
5
I've been to this restaurant twice. The first time was absolutely amazing. The second time I went although the food was just as good what made it worse was the waiter. She kept on coming every two minutes asking if we were done while we clearly weren't done. She kept on coming early with the food and forcing it on to our table. The first time i went we had a different waiter. There was no problem and the food was very good. The view of Marina Bay with the different coloured lights was very beautiful. Seeing the tanks of the microbrewery was interesting. i loved the fact that there was not a single dish that i wouldn't want to eat. I love Level33
4
Went for a family celebration on evening. Very enjoyable. The views over the Marina Bay and CBD area are stunning and from the balcony you can either have pre meal drinks or even eat. Our table was inside, but we took drinks outside for the view.The food comes in modestly sized portions but is very good indeed - certainly worth the prices. Wines were expensive but most people drink the excellent beers which are brewed on site. A dinner with 2 courses and a few beers each comes to about S$100 per person
2
My partner and I went to Level33 after I had seen some beautiful pictures of lovely Sunday Dinners. As British expats we miss a good old Sunday Roast and thought we would treat ourselves to one out (30th November).Firstly, I was disappointed that there was no starters on the menu and only one small roll was bought to the table per person. Not a huge issue, just one to note if you anticipate big meal.As soon as we were seated at 3.30pm we were promptly told that 1 of the 4 mains dishes, Chicken, and 2 of the 3 side dishes were unavailable. No problem. After both ordering Lamb and waiting 10 minutes we were told that too had run out so we had to make an alternative choice and went for beef.When our food finally arrived the potatoes were hard and the whole dish was cold. We asked for our plates to be taken away as it was so cold it was unpalatable. Our side dish was also cold but as our mains were whisked away the side was left in the middle of the table. I was unable to get the attention of the 2 members of staff chatting so took the plate up myself and asked if it could also be re-fired as it was cold, and even if it wasn't, it would be by the time our roasts had come out.The 2nd dish that came out wasn't a huge improvement on the first as it was served on a cold plate. I am quite sure pumpkin and courgettes aren't traditional for a reason as they didn't bring much to the meal. Over the whole dinner was a over reduced, sticky gravy that in the first taste was lovely but on the 3rd just coated your mouth and didn't leave room for any other flavours.Over halfway through our meal a member of staff came and apologised for the substandard first dish and offered an alternative meal. This was very thoughtful but a little too late and ultimately not what we came for. Staff were apologetic and did offer a free coffee to compensate for the poor standard of the first meal we had been served. However I still left disappointed and underwhelmed by my experience. If staff had been a bit more attentive and offered a relevant substitution I would have been a bit more satisfied. Last orders for deserts were called when we where halfway through out main course at which point i didn't really know if I would want one or not.This may have been a very different experience if we had arrived earlier in the day. The view is great and as much as I felt the customer service lacked in areas, an effort was made
4
We went to Bar 33 for drinks and also dinner, arriving at 5,45pm to enjoy drinks on the balcony with great views of the Marina. The cocktails are delicious and my companion enjoyed the Paddles of craft beers. The service was very good, and we had a Tapas dish of nuts and chickpeas and olives to keep us going until the meal. All the Tapas that came out looked delicious. We then had dinner in the restaurant, the service was a little slow but the food was delicious and very well presented - anti-past to start with a lot of meat - I think it is meant as a starter for 2 but 3 people shared it very happily and I had a cheese board! For the main course, 2 of us had the Trout which was delicious and 2 had Steak which was excellent. We ordered a couple of sides to make sure we had enough food and were more that happy with everything that we had. Overall it was a great way to spend our last night in Singapore and is recommended. Not cheap but worth it
5
Level 33 is a little tricky to find at first, in Tower 1 of the new Marina Bay Financial centre. But once you get there it's a revelation - they brew their own beer all the way up there, and have decent Bar food to accompany it too.Everywhere seems to have a view in Singapore, but there's nowhere I'd rather relax with a pint than Level 33 :-
3
Nice view from the restaurant. $33 set lunch with good spread of buffet appetitiser is value for $$. However service definitely needs improvement. Was seated and waiting for another friend. After a long while, had to call the server to get us some water. After our meal my galfriend and I went to get some dessert while another of our friend sat to watch over the belongings. Came back to a puddle of water on the floor and was told the server spilled my glass of beer. My galfriend's branded handbag got wet at the side. The server came to ask us to wait as he will be getting me another glass of beer. I told him I had to go back to work so couldnt take another beer, rather he waived it off the bill. (I drank half of the glass before it was spilled). He replied he could not do that and suggested that my friends could have it if I cant drink anymore!!! They were already been served their order of coffee. We were so pissed! Would reconsider coming back here
4
First, it's Singapore, so don't expect value for money, second, its Singapore so don't expect the worlds best service...BUT...the beers are cold, they are a decent drop for a city that severely lacks decent craft beers AND it has the best view of the Singapore skyline bar none. this is a great spot for a few drinks in the evening before kicking on, or for a few night caps to finish off a cheaper meal elsewher
3
Visiting for lunch my group found L33's Lunch Time menu excellent value. For $33 you have access to a wide range of Entree's from the buffet plus a main from the menu (a choice of three). The quality of the food was very good as was the amazing beers that are brewed on site. The ambience and the views are very good however the attentiveness of the staff is much to be desired. Several mistakes in drink orders, leaving our table unattended for long periods of time was unacceptable, even for Singapore standards. Good venue that could be made great with customer service.
4
It has a great eagle-eye views of Singapore, including Marina Bay Sands and Gardens by the Bay at the balcony.
Making reservation is not convenient. They don't reserve an outdoor or window side table, just a table.
5
We had a very memorable birthday meal overlooking Marina Bay. We booked an outdoor table. We were given excellent service by Ming, and the whole experience was faultless.
2
We ordered: Starter : onion soup (1/10) $18.00- it was really quite a disappointment. The soup has a bread soaked in it and and full of unions. Taste was below average. Main course: Gambas (3/10) $38- comes w 2 gigantic prawn, soba noodles. The prawn taste decent. But not fantastic. Noodles was the disappointment. Taste plain and normal. Will not recommend. Main course: chicken (2/10) $30+- comes w 3 big cubes of chicken chunks and some vegs. Chicken is plain and spoilt the dinner appetite. The veg taste normal too. Not worth it. Drinks: tea & water $6.00Total dinner cost for 2 pax : $110Service: service was decent though. If you want an outdoor sit with the MBS/flyer view, you may need to make a reservation in advance
4
There is always a danger that places offering a nice view as their USP end up in serving average food at high-end prices. Level 33 is a pleasant surprise: Their food is quite good and the prices are on the reasonable side (it's still Singapore, though). I wasn't too impressed by the wine list, but then again this venue is a microbrewery offering their own beers. If you want to enjoy the view over the bay during dinner, I recommend this restaurant
5
We decided to come here for a daytime view after not making it the night before, and the brunch food here surprised us! They use quality New Zealand eggs in their dishes and have a variety of choices. It's also a quiet place past noon on a Saturday. Highly recommended
3
We came after we had our dinner elsewhere, we heard that this is the place to go for a great view over the Marina Bay, and it surely live to that claim. You can go to L33 if you around fullerton area, the restaurant situated at level 33 (obviously) in the Standard Chartered building. Easy to spot on, just remember to take the elevator closer to the traffic light. If you find yourself lost, just ask around and people will gladly help. Basically the place is a brewery with super stunning view at night. Although, they have lot of seatings but looking on how busy they are, sometimes it just won't fit. We have to stand for a good solid 2 hours before we had a table. The price of beer a bit expensive even for a Singapore standard. You will see lot of people but not so many partying since everyone only limit they consumption to 1-2 pints. Because of that, staffs can sometimes be pushy on ordering their food off the menu. Especially if you come with new friends and just want to have beer. Atmosphere was perfect, the weather was kind to us and the skies were clear that night. I wouldn't suggest family with kids to come here. But if you looking for a place for great view or maybe to get to know your new friends, and don't mind the higher price of things here. L33 will be the place, with such great view you will have something to start the conversations.
5
We visited quite late in the evening for post dinner drinks. We were seated initially inside and had one drink before the waiter let us know there was a table on the balcony. And what a great view of the Singapore skyline at night. The beers were very good and considering the splendid view quite reasonable value. Not to say they were inexpensive. I tried a couple of the beer selections and both were pretty good. Which is a good thing because they could almost get away with anything given the view from their 33rd floor balcony.It's worth a visit just for the view. It's a bonus that the beers are good as well. Can't comment on the food, we didn't try it. We'd be really tempted to try having lunch here and see the view in daylight. At night it's pretty spectacular
2
The restaurant has magnificent view of Marina Bay which is the best from a long balcony outside. Wine and champagne selection quite good, waiters help to choose. I had scallops as a starter and it was excellent. However, it all turned for the worse when the main courses were served - 4/6 people received cold dishes. It didn't make things better when the chief waiter started arguing about "only 4 degrees below norm" temperature of the stakes... If you want truly good dining experience, its not the place for that:
2
Food and sides was served late and cold. After third try from the kitchen we left the place.The staff was friendly but seemed extremely disorganised and without any management in place. Fantastic wines and views though. Would never go back, the view is just not worth it.
4
L33 is one of my favorite in Singapore. this time I particularly like their quick arrangement for group reservation and tried to accommodate quickly. We broke reservation rule by having couple of additional people joining us later for drink (they were meant to be at the bar) but we could arrange them to join us for couple of laugh. Everyone appreciated the great views, food and win
1
Terrible service. Even after complaining service didn't improve. Staff didn't seem too bothered. Food passable.
5
Relaxing dinner with fantastic views! Level 33 has a wide range of entrees with scrumptious salads and delectable desserts! Our service was great! Wonderful place for conversation, as well!

A Restaurant with a Craft brewery on 33rd floor. Beside a great view, they serve excellent food and have a great collection of homebrewed beer. A must to be visited. A reservation is necessary. They are always overbooked at lunch and Dinner.

The views from this restaurant is stunning...and it is a great pity that it ends there. If you are looking for a nice place to see Marina Bay at its best, then yes, it will indeed provide you with what you are looking for.Otherwise, food was rather mediocre, service was bad. We had the Sunday roast, and there was nothing to shout about. Very ordinary roasts, cuts of meat could have been better, our cauliflower sides were still a little raw. Service was poor, with an attitude of being unwilling to help. Food took a while to be served. For those with young children who needs a high chair, please note that this restaurant does not provide one

The experience at LeVel 33 doesn't turn bad just because of the rainy evening. The view continues to be amazing, overseeing key Singapore landmark such as our MBS, Singapore flyer, and the new Sports hub. Other than the good view, the food was good, with many exquisite cuisine. Pig and Snail was amazing. :) We had friendly staff as well, that consistently checked if everything is going alright with the food and such. Other then the food, we came for the beer as well. It was good, better than several other brewery that I had tried. Had Blond Lager and it didn't fail my expectations! would love to come again to try the other stuff on the menu!
5
Our second visit to LeVel33 and it is certainly one of our favourite places. Given the view over Marina Bay, good beers and tasty food, the prices aren't bad at all. Eat from the tapas style menu in the bar area or terrace would be my suggestion. If you're visiting Singapore for only a few days, make sure you go here.

Another great view of Marina Bay but very over priced. We only had two beers and a small bowl of nuts to accompany our drinks. Our bill on leaving totalled $31.40 SD. Mmm lucky for us on giving them $50 SD we received $31.80 SD change. I think Karma. Apart from the prices the staff were friendly and attentive. A great venue worth a look and if you can swallow the prices have a beer

I think this place has one of the better views and without the hype and fuss of the other locations in the area. This is easily accessed from Raffles Place and you take a separate elevator from Tower 1 up to 33rd floor.This is more of a beer related bar and restaurant, but don't let that think it's simple. There was a fantastic Beer Mojito (yes, and I do like my traditional mojito's) but this was refreshing and very good. I never thought it would be this nice.i have not tried the food here, only visited for drinks and great view. If you don't come early or don't have reservations well in advance, you may be limited how good of a view you get but if you don't mind standing room only for a drink, it's good.There were complaints here of the staff, and yes it took a bit of time to flag someone to get our order. Just be a bit more direct and get their attention if you are having trouble, don't be passive and wait for them to stop by to get your order
1
Lovely place with great beer choice, no ciders though and was really let down by possibly the worst steak ever encountered SG$ 98, for a 50/50 split of decent steak and fat, no apology and nothing knocked of the bill, not even 10% as a goodwill gesture, really poo
2
Positive mentions first:- Changed my mind to have sparkling water instead of still and staff promptly changed it- Very enthusiastic waiter who helped us to take numerous group photosNot-so-positives:- Staff's attitude was snobbish. Yes I know Starters come before Mains and her condescending tone was not appreciated.- We ordered the Seafood medley to share and the thin-sliced salmon was not evenly seasoned, and the thick-sliced salmon tasted funny/not fresh.- My friends ordered the Beef, Beef & Reef and Back & Belly, and asked for all the beef to be medium-rare but one of the dish was served well done. However to give credit to the staff, she was apologetic and promptly got it replaced.- My Rigatoni was undercooked so I felt like I was basically chewing on tasteless rubber.In short, food was mediocre at best, service can be improved but splurge on the view if you must
4
Relaxed bar with amazing views over Singapore Marina Bay. Great for chilling out with friends over drinks.
5
Level33 has become our "go to" place for entertaining visitors to Sngapore as well as for a relaxing night out. The steaks and beer are consistently tasty. The view over the Marina is wonderful dressing for the night enjoying the well brewed beers.
2
This restaurant has an excecllent view at Level 33 of Marina Bay Financial Centre. Novelty ends there.. Food is just average and it lacks flavour that a Fine Dining restaurants normally boast of.. Pricey as hell. Surely can give it a miss
5
Love, love, love.
My 1st stop whenever I visit Singapore. Reserve a table outside, you have to spend $120 SGD, which isn't difficult, but well worth it.
Not as touristy as Ku De Ta and much more chilled.
3
The views of marina bay sands and cbd area from the restaurant are awesome!! Beer from the microbrewery is good, but the food is not as good as the view or drinks. Nevertheless, it is a nice place for hanging out!!
4
Level33 is an excellent casual and business environment. Great views of the bay and very simple menu of classic food which works well. The atmosphere is very relaxed. Service is okay and food pretty good.
5
The food , service and view is great. I have nothing much to say . Go and experience then would know what I saying
4
We went here for drinks one evening and the bar was really relaxed. It has amazing views over Singapore, great bar snacks, amazing drinks (they brew their own beer) and perfect location.We would really recommend paying a visit here for drinks (we didn't eat any meals here as arrived late but the bar 'snacks' we had were yummy and 4 between the 2 of us was definitely enough food for dinner!).Make sure you get there early to get a table outside, or ask the staff to move you once a table becomes available as being sat outside is much nicer - you really get to experience the view properly!Definitely worth a trip
2
We had expectations of a traditional Sunday roast in a unusual setting 33 floors up. sadly it didn't deliver, the place is getting tired and the food was a let down. Meat was poor and my wife left her lamb but to the staff credit they didn't charge and were very apologetic. Wine over priced and limited. staff wee attentive and apologetic
5
Best time to visit is at dusk so that you see the city come to life during dinner and drinks. Great range of micro beers and fantastic food. You'll pay for it but its worth it for a special night out. Make sure you take 5 minutes out on the deck area outside after your meal for a few photo
4
A great location for a meal with amazing views over the city. The highest micro brewery in the world obviously has great beer! Good quality food and attentive service.
5
The best selection of tapas and fusion in town with certainly best view from the top. Amazing place indeed.
5
What a fantastic place to sit and relax on the balcony high up above Singapore. Staff were great and food amazing
5
The setting of this restaurant is stunning, and it makes excellent use of the views; definitely worth requesting a table outside! The food was fantastic; we had the ribs and steak and they were both some of the best we have ever tasted.
5
One of my friends recommended this place before I came on my trip to Singapore and I'm glad I decided to check it out by having dinner here. It's at the top of the DBS building in the financial center and looks out across Marina Bay to the Singapore Flyer and all of the lit up high rises on the other side. Our table wasn't immediately next to the window, and I was concerned first of all that we wouldn't get such good views, but after the waitress took our order and brought our wine, she invited us to take time to go out to a large outside bar/balcony till our food was ready. So we took full advantage!Back inside we found the menu to be good, and when the food arrived, it was delicious. Lots of lovely flavors going on!We thought the general service from beginning to end was good, going above and beyond we expected
5
This has got to be one of the best views in the city and likely the best view for a brewpub anywhere! We were visiting a friend in Singapore and she knows we like to sample beers, Level 22 was a home run! This is a better view than from the marina bay and the beers were very worth a try - we tried them all, Highly recommended!
4
This restaurant has one of the best views of Singapore. I recommend you go in around 6pm and grab a couple of drinks so you Singapore in daylight and then Singapore at night. The Food is great as well. Has a reasonable wine list as well. As it gets busy the service sometimes can be a bit slow an irritating! Well price for the ambiance and the quality of food. Definitely recommend
4
Went here with a couple of friends for a Lunch before F1. Was a good buffet as a starter, as well as a good main course. The Chips/fries wasn't the best, but the meat as well as sides was great.. The Beers are nice as well, and the View makes it an excellent place for Lunch or Dinner
5
Nice beers/ales and they change the special every month, ribs were finger licking good and the view is lovely. Nice atmosphere for a weeknight will definitely go back or take friends in town here. Prices are pretty average for a decent place in town with a view. (If you enjoy microbreweries, also check out Red Dot on Boat Quay
5
This has the best view of Marina Bay. It was easy to get to and is a working brewery so smells a little like hops.The food was delicious and they have a buffet set up for a self serve entree with plenty of choices. After your meal, the buffet also has desserts. Drinks are not cheap but the beer was and they had an impressive range.The staff were friendly and only a short wait for the food.We loved it and would go back
4
Great view, but not the best beer in all honesty. A definite place to visit, I went midweek so easily got a seat outside to admire the light show that is singapore.
4
Lovely environment. Place to chill with friends. I love this dessert, Torte - Pan baked 70% bitter chocolate, hazelnut praline, ganache, mandarin and candied orang infused mascarpone. You may reserve the outdoor tables for the lovely night view of Singapore!
4
Service was a tad underwhelming.....Food was good but again it was a very busy brunch. I would recommend it for dinner instead....
5
on location on marina boulevard, this is elegant bar and restaurant. fantastic european foods, awesome sunset view =D, i likes any cocktails, pretty to see than i drank any way :)
4
I love this place for drinks, very worth the while at any point for a nice pint. We went on a Sunday for a roast and it was delicious.
4
This is my 4th visit to LeVeL33 and the view is as usual, no less than spectacular! Love the ambience and the food portion was generous. A good place to impress your guests, both local and overseas.
4
A perfect place for a corporate party. With live music, fantastic food and attentive staff this place ticks all the boxes. Wonderful views overlooking Marina Bay and outer islands even more amazing as the night goes on. Highly recommended.
4
Our family had brunch at LeVel 33 on a Saturday afternoon. Initially we had wanted beer dining. We were told that there's a minimum charge of $60 per pax if we made a reservation, however, there is no minimum charge for walk-ins. For our brunch, we had the classic burger, All Day Breakfast and French Toast. The portion were quite small, served on a huge plate, but they were good. The All Day Breakfast came with a sunny side egg, crispy bacon, sausage and fat cut chips. Unlike the usual french fries, the chips are made from thick cut potatoes. The French Toast is really nice with raisins and maple syrup on it. After our meal,we went to the terrace outside for the view. The view of Marina Bay is magnificent. We were here for the view and we were not disappointed. We would like to return for the view of sunset and the evening scenery
4
Food is okay but there are many better places to eat in Singapore. But for me the combination of interesting boutique beers and the stupendous view make this a great venue for an after dinner sharpener or two - I'm not a cocktails man but the girls with us said they were fine. Go after dinner, and when you order your first drinks ask to be put on the list for a table outside - they won't forget. I haven't been to all the rooftop bars in Sing but the prices here aren't extortionate and the views over Marina Bay and the City are pretty spectacular

I ordered a medium steak with and a beer. Asking the waitress if there is a side dish with the steak she said yes….-there isn't!!As the steak arrived I asked to get some potatoes as it didn't look filling Definitely one of the expensive dishes and I assumed there is no special magic necessary to prepare a steak.So I sat there waiting for the potatoes for 5 minutes and then decided to start eating the steak befor it's getting cold…That piece of meat was awkwardly hard to cut and soon I realized why… It was completely rare inside having maybe a 4mm crust…I told the waitress I wanted a medium steak and I'm not able to eat that! She apologized and took the plate away. After 2 minutes a waiter brings my potatoes. I instantly asked if my steak will reappear soon and ensured it will be here very soon.After 10 minutes potatoes already a bit frosty my new steak was served. Looking very good. But the first impression was wrong. Again completely rare. only difference, this time it hat a 1.5cm "zone" of cooked meat…Again I asked the waitress to take a look if that's medium…again she apologized and took the plate away…offering a free dessert as compensation which I accepted of course.Now I was wondering what I should do with cold potatoes and asked to get them reheated.The Chef was already looking a bit annoyed towards our table but well…it wasn't my fault.Now the potatoes reappeared but still no steak was visible. Before I could ask what could be the need of getting them back now the waitress disappeared quickly. My colleagues were already finished with their dinner for quite some and started making jokes if I would ever get something to eat.Then finally one more steak appeared and this time a waiter was waiting if the steak was ok this time. So I cut into it and…what a surprise…outside overcooked…inside rare…and got again the offer to change it once more…So that was it. I got really angry now and told them that's enough. I will eat the outside and the potatoes but decline to pay for that! And that he can bring back the menu so I could choose my free dessert which I will take on the deck.After a dispute and my request to get me his boss if he has a problem with that the agreed that I only have to pay for the potatoes and the beer…Overall-I will never come back…Sorry guys, but you messed up completely with that
4
This was my second trip to Level33, and I was not disappointed. Enjoyed the food selection - portion size is just right and the sides are great for sharing.
It's on the pricey side, but what isn't in Singapore?
4
Level 33 is centrally located (8 Marina Boulevard) on the 33rd floor of a skyscraper. We took the restaurant's own elevator up and met with a wonderful brewing smells. The explanation was that the brewery is located inside the pub (also a fancy restaurant section) and that the brewer had opened one of the tubs. We tasted all the beers. A taste tray with blonde lager (tastes the best: fresh and easy to drink with a little taste of wheat beer), English Pale Ale, Stout (rather tasteless and low-alcohol), Wheat beer and seasonal beer Oaked Bock. The view of downtown Singapore was amazing
3
This was my second visit to level 33. My first visit was very positive on a weekday night celebrating the birthday of a close friend. Service was amazing back in July. Special detail was paid to us and the pre-ordered birthday choc cake. This time round service was abysmal. I'm shocked that level 33 would hire servers like Raj and Zul. Based on my first positive experience I was excited to surprise my husband for his birthday. Unfortunately due to his work I had to change the time of my reservation. I had earlier emailed to confirm the birthday pre-order special. When I reached the place rushing to make the last order, Raj, told me to wait in the corner. He promised to check on my pre-order and never returned. Zul then said he would check. He came back saying the desserts were closed at the same time a nice kind indian lady server who i sadly did not catch her name said she would ensure that my birthday dessert order was done. Zul even had the cheek to ask me whether my husband would be arriving after I ordered the food. I mean really? It is appalling that my pre-ordered birthday dessert simply vanished. What would they do with it anyway? I requested for my husband's name on it! The two servers Raj and Zul came across as rude and snide. Worse still Raj couldn't seem to explain any recommendations properly.
4
Our hotel recommended this restaurant as we wanted something quirky, with a great view and even better food. We were not disappointed at all. The menu and selection of beer was brilliant. I would highly recommend the Steak Tartar. The service was quite poor however with the fantastic views it didn’t seem to bother us too much
3
Where all previous visits were great, the one last weekend was not. We were served by an apparently new waitress who kept on rushing us leaving us with the feeling we would have to make place for the next shift. While my son had not even finished his main, the desert menu was already on the table. When ordering drinks and starters and asking for some bread the answer was that this would come when we would order maincourse? All in all a bad (a first) experience at level 33. Will be looking out for an other place to bring visiting friends and family from abroad..
5
Great place to take friends who come into town to enjoy the view of the bay. The lamb shoulder and banjo is a regular favourite of ours, but know to order it early as the waiting time is 40 mins. The view of the bay is great and we always find the service staff to be friendly and prompt. The beers are also very enjoyable - the bock served in a wine glass is always a hit
4
I visited this place for the first time during my latest visit to Singapore along with my colleagues. If you do not want to be kept waiting, it is always better to go for an advance booking and that also much in advance. We initially tried booking the place but was informed that they were booked for the full evening but later received a call informing that due to a late cancellation, we can be accommodated. This is a great place serving good food and craft beer. You land up paying more than what you are expected to pay more so due to the reason that you get a spectacular view of the neighborhood from the 33rd floor of Marina Bay Financial Centre Tower 1 including Marina Bay Sands and the Singapore Flyer. I feel the best time to visit is just before sunset and spend the time to see the entire area lit up after sunset. To get a good view around I would suggest to opt for one of the outside tables. Service is good and if you are confused with what to go for, do take assistance from the friendly staff and their advice. You will not feel let down.Go for it....if not for anything at least once to enjoy the view :
4
The view of the Marina is phenomenal - The beer was cool and staff was ... OK - everyone wants to have a table with a view to the Marina and if someone is outside standing at a table, one would expect it should be possible to move a chair from one table to another - NO WAY ! However it is not the rule which we didn't like - it is more the way this is being communicated. Nevertheless - it is always worthwile going there for a beer and enjoy the lightshow at the Marina
2
The quality of food is ok, my issue was really space. We were place on a long table very close to the wall. we were seated inside whilst our boss was seated at the first seat, opposite us were our clients. Whilst that is perfectly ok if it is a sit down meal, if you have your salad table and your deserts are also self serviced, it creates a tremendous inconvenience for those seated right inside. Our boss decided to skip dessert and we didnt get to have any as well as we didnt wish to inconvenience everyone to get up so that we can get our deserts. Seconds were also out of the question.
4
Wow... what a nice view. I think this is a must if you are in Singapore. The restaurant offers different kind of food and the taste was really good. The view is the best thing here. So if you make a reservation you should ask for a outside table. It´s incredible.I think the best way to make a reservation is the app "Chope"
1
We had made reservation for a birthday lunch, had a confirmation, and when we ordered the food (poor choice), we were told waiting time 30 minutes even though only 4 tables were occupied and 2 had alredy their food. So we left the place!
4
Good ambience and atmosphere! As for the food is average. The service is great. The price is a bit at the high end.
5
What an awesome place, talk about sky high craft beer bar, this is it! Probably the only one of its kind, great service, good food and always busy. The views are amazing especially at sunset and night time over looking the Marina 33 floors up. Decor'd with the VATs right in front of you not yo mention the brewmasters in the middle of the bar! A gem and nothing like I have seen before
5
Ok, before i start please be reminded that we are in an area of prime estate, within the banking environment. Based on this i am always pleasantly suprised that this establishment is not more expensive than it is. To keep the price comparison simple, 5 yrs ago before leaving our home town of Preston, Lancashire i paid the same amount for a good steak as i have done this weekend on the 33 rd level restaurant with magnificent views of one of the most amazing city skylines ive ever seen. My hubbie and i usually go with a group of friends all of which have never been disappointed with the food, service and of course, the view is sensational.
4
I thought I had booked a table but discovered I had the wrong date on arrival, doh! The staff said they were booked up for days but found us a table anyway, next to the window. Impressed! Incredible to think that they have set up a bar and brewery on the 33rd floor. The logistics must be a nightmare. I found the beers as good as most US/UK craft breweries. I especially liked the wheat beer (good for the climate) and the porter. The menu was fairly simple but not many options for vegetarians (pasta and pasta). The food was creative and presented well. I left most of my main as I was that full. The view from this designer restaurant is everything here so bring a camera
4
Had a few drinks here, admiring the amazing view. Bring your camera if you are keen for a killer panoramic photo of the city. Great shots!Had a couple of craft beers. Pretty good and very cold. Looked. Like a very popular place during the week for the corporate setSat outside for our first beer but was incredibly hot so relocated inside. Doesn't open until 1130 weekdays
5
I have been there with my husband to have a special dinner on astonishing Marina Bay by night. People friendly and professional, food surprising and the view from terrace is unbelievable. We spend a special evening and the cost has been correct for what we had. Hope to come back to Singapore very soon and have an other special dinner at Level 33. We absolutely recommend this plac
3
We had dinner with friends and enjoyed the experience without being wowed by it. The food was okay, the service was okay but the restaurant had a great vibe. The restaurant specialises in beer which it brews on site and besides the variety of beer options it is used in many of the meals as well. The waiters used an automated ordering system which tells them how long the order will take before being served. It's great to be told it will take 25 minutes if it arrives around that time, not 10-15 minutes later. Tip: start your meal with a drink on the external balcony and soak in the marvellous Marina Bay view.
3
We arrive at this wonderful location about 2:30 pm and were greeted by an incredibly complex, rapid fire set of instructions about what we could and couldn't do as we were between standard meal times or something along those lines. Wondering what all that was about, we sat out on the open viewing area which is just excellent and, for me, a SIngapore "must do". The panoramic view of the various Marina bay structures and all the water and Singapore highrises is something you will not tire of. The beer (brewed surprisingly on premises) is really nice although sold at full Singapore prices. I suggest being generous - it really is nice. Unfortunately, the food portions are tiny, the service painfully slow and most staff project a "whatever" attitude. Hummous, for example, comes without sufficient bread and once we realised this it must have been 30 muniutes before our supplementary bread order arrived - that sort of thing. I think they are banking on the great location and maybe it is all better managed in the evening when i expect there are many more customers. I strongly recommend a visit - just don't arrive hungry
5
The overall experience was memorable and I would recommend this as a must visit restaurant for the atmosphere & service.We reached a bit early for our 7:30 reservation but were accommodated without much fuss. Being a microbrewery, we had to sample the beer range and were not disappointed. The range of craftsman beer had distinct and unique tastes (I enjoyed them even though I am not a beer fan).We had requested outdoor seating facing the marina bay. The transformation of the scenic view from evening into night was just magical. We had several other visitors near our table trying to get a view of the bay but I guess the informality was part of the restaurant's charm. The service was attentive and the service staff did make small talk while at the table. The T Bone steak to share, was OK. It was cooked well but I had expected better quality of meat (my wife disagreed and thought it was very good). The side dishes of carrots, potatoes and broccoli went well with the steaks. However, we both did not like the Broccoli with cheese sauce). The horseradish, mustard sauces were good.I would come back again
4
we had a 10 pax group, S$35 per person, include one main course and buffet appetizer, worthy the money, and taste ok to me.
3
Great place to take guests from our of town as the view is amazing. The buffet lunch is good for a quick lunch.
Dinner however can be a bit expensive for what you get and the food doesn't match the view.
4
Great view and nice beers, a little bit pricey but in such place, we always pay the view... It is nice outside and slightly windy. It could be crowded outside and hard to find a place to seat.
4
Its a really nice place to hang out with your friends in singapore, they have a really nice beer and nice marina bay sand view.
4
Came here twice, once for brunch on a Saturday, and another time for a evening drink. Conclusion: View is fantastic, beer is good, food is average. Food portion is rather small, and on the day we had our brunch, the ingredients did not seem that fresh. More value for money for a evening drink instead. Try to arrive before 5pm and the chances of getting an outdoor seat is still high
4
LeVeL33, the World's Highest Urban Craft-brewery....one of the best views of Singapore's Marina Bay and city skyline. InMarina Bay Financial Centre (MBFC). Multiple visits. Relaxing. Wait staff a little in attentive. Try the hot bread dips great for sharing over a few brewskis.5 beers regularly on tap (blond, wheat, pale, stout, porter, plus regular specials e.g. The rapidly sold out IPA-please make it a regular!). Considering the view very reasonable prices. Great balcony - avoid in wet Weather - balcony closed. Great location for first timers to the city and for business entertaining.Enjo

I have actually been to Level 33 on two occasions, once for dinner and today for lunch. Dinner was pleasant, the menu is interesting but small portions on big plates, actually once i left the place, i was still hungry and ended up in a McDonalds!!! The service is terrible, you need to ask twice for drinks, menus, remind the staff about what was ordered and the food seems to take for ever, and in my case, the food arrived cold....i did complain but nothing was done about it......Today was no exception. We had a reservation. Actually if you are trying to book online, don't bother. They block the system so you actually have to phone them to get a reservation. If you are trying to book from overseas, like i was, this is a complete waste of money to make an international call to make a reservation for a restaurant....sorry not going to happen.So i settled for lunch.....it was ok. The place was not busy but the service was still so so....For what is billed as an upmarket restaurant, they really need to brush up their act. I do have to say though that they have some very interesting beers, brewed on site, which is pretty neat.I will be going back to drink but not to eat, the views are excellent i have to say
5
I use the LeVel33 quite frequently to entertain business partners, treat my team or for private family occasions. And I never got disappointed!The service team at the reception always makes sure that I get my preferred table, never misses a reservation and also calls back if an opening comes up when everything is booked out.The waiters are very patient (if you can't decide on drinks), fast once you ordered and always available to take pictures. The menu caters for big and small appetite and especially the bar food is very delicious. My all time favorite is the cold cut plate to share.I'm not a beer drinker but the once who are rave about it and also enjoy the different seasonal types offered. No wonder, since their brewer comes for the famous "beer"-university of Weihenstephan. The view from the terrace is absolutely stunning and even after many times visiting, I never get tired of it
3
I had lunch here with a group of friends. Upon entering the restaurant, you immediately notice how bright the place is as the day light comes in through the large floor to ceiling windows that span the dining area. We had to squint. Although I'm sure it has a nice view at night, it would have been more comfortable during the day if they had installed blinds that came down half way. Set Lunch is priced at SGD33 and comes with free flow buffet of starters, salads and dessert, plus choice of one main course. The starters were tasty. I chose the burger and fries as my main course. The waiter told me that the meat is cooked medium, but when it came, it was well done. It was also too fatty for my liking and I had to keep spitting out the fatty bits which was quite unpleasant. The menu said that the meat and ketchup are beer infused but it really didnt taste like it. On the whole, i thought the burger was so so. Dessert was nice. I tried the eclairs, cream puffs and fig tart which were all good. My friends took the last 2 slices of hazelnut cake and said it was good. That was at 1pm. The rest of us wanted to try it but it was never replenished. On the whole, price for set lunch is reasonable for what you get and also considering that it is in the heart of the business district. However, I won't be going back again.
3
The view and service is impeccable, the price of food is reasonable, but in relation to the portion size is shameful. The 'sirloin' beef is literally the size of a toddlers (no older than 2/3) knuckle. And the beef and reef main course included ONE king prawn.Although all three courses were commendable in flavour, you are most certainly paying for the view rather than food.
4
Tried their in house brewed beer sampler and the portion is just right for 2 pax who don't usually drink. Nice views, which we saw fireworks in the rehearsal for the National Day.
4
Set lunch menu, 3 courses for $33++ (of which 2 courses are an all you can eat help your self buffet) seemed great value, the food was delicious. The beer brewed on site was also tasty, you can see it being made. There is an outdoor terrace with awesome views of Marina bay sands and the city. The bar has an office worker crowd and a selfie army flocking the balcony. Overall positive experience and would go back
5
We treated my girlfriends grandma for a birthday Sunday lunch here. Level33 boasts the worlds highest micro brewery. The beer is very tasty and you can order a tasting paddle. My advice is to go for Sunday lunch as the portions are huge, the price reasonable and the view is of the bay over looking the iconic Marina Bay
4
It was a place at the top of marina financial center and it really has a nice view. The food was alright, I had a fish and chips and the fish was fresh and presented nicely. The risotto looked good and they had a vegetarian meal that's not so bad. They had some buffet stuff which I thought were so so only and their spread not exactly the widest. In all not too bad if you are looking for a place with a view.
4
LeVel 33 was only a short ride from my hotel, (Sofitel So Hotel) but during the night time rush hour, it was terrible. Definitely schedule accordingly if you plan to taxi during rush hour. The restaurant was pretty busy at 8 pm. Our party had outside seating. Drinks and food came pretty quickly for how busy the place was. I ordered a few Vodka Tonics which were made correctly. BBQ chicken wings were flavorful. View was spectacular. But, it was extremely hot outside even from 8-10 pm. I think it would be wise to set up some fans outside. It would help cool down the guest outside. One of my friend had to stand inside for 30 minutes just to cool off

Stunning in-your-face restaurant views, that would be tough to top anywhere in the world. The beer is good enough, the service is fine, and the food is up-market pub food. Good quality, and priced appropriately. I am a regular customer, and all together this is my favourite dining experience in Singapore.
5
The view from this place is incredible - we were lucky enough to have a balcony table looking over the bay and stayed for around 5 hours eating and drinking. The food is good, modern but not over the top and the drinks are great. Book this place if you are going to Singapore

Always go here when in Singa as the Beer is exceptional, especaily the Dark beer.The bar snack foods can be a bit pricey but the fish and chips are heavenly with the beer.The staff very attentive and good at clearing away the glasses, but not so good at seeing your glass in getting empty and coming a across to take your next order. Maybe they are not use to the drinking habits of the Scots.Afternoons are very quiet but when the sun starts to go down you do get the tourists comming in and pushing you at your table so they can get there photo at the balcony edge of the lights going on over SinagporeI do wish the staff would regulate the photo hunters who do not drink but disturb the others who have been sitting since afternoon and spending money.Get a dark beer sit back and enjoy, it is the best brewery bar in Singapore, not just with the views but the fantastic beers
5
I just stopped in right after sunset for a beer and a cocktail. Both where very delicious. We had a standing table on the balcony and the view was exceptional it's a nice alternative to altitude where they have dress codes and cover charges. The in house brewery is beautiful to see at work. I definitely recommend.
5
I have been there several times and I bring every single Singapore visitor to this bar, as the view is the best in town. You see the ships, MBS, Marina Bay, etc. The beer brewed up there is very tasty and the overall price level is reasonable, given the awesome location
5
Great food combined with a unique view of Singapore and including its own micro-brewery. Beer a bit expensive but worth it for the experience and it was packed so bookings recommended, which is also a sign it is good!
5
Don't miss to visit LeVel 33 when you visit Singapore. If it's possible, order outside around sunset, it is a fabulous view over the sea and all the lights from the ships.
We got wonderful food and wine, and the staff was very kind.
5
Nice place with solid, clean beers. Pale Ale was creamy good. Dark Wheat is good, easy drinking. Great service. Worth the visit. The views are amazing, with the Garden by the Bay right in front of you and ships on the sea.

Level33 has a great view and some good beer. Beer of this standard is usually about $15 per 500ml around town. At Level33 it is $18 which is 20% above normal. This is presumably for the great view. This is great for one or two beers, but for a few beers the cost will add up and you'll stop appreciating the view anyway ! Worth trying but there are better beer options at better prices available in town.

Go to the Marina Bay Financial district Center Tower 1 and there are signs to the private elevator to LeVeL33. I booked a table on their terrace for our anniversary on a Sunday. We were told via email that the reservation will be honored if we spend over $100+ and that was very easy to do. We ordered sizzling waygu, fried softshell crab and their version of fish and chips, which were the best, from their bar menu. My husband opted for their beers, but the waiter got the sizes wrong and my bottle size of Panna. I don't know if they pool tips there, but we never got the same server twice. No one came to ask if our food was ok. We always had to grab a server passing by our table if we needed another drink, etc. I ordered one of the signature cocktails mixed with actual gold dust. It looked pretty cool, iridescent, and was yummy.I looked for a place that didn't charge a cover just for the view, so LeVeL 33 was the best choice. We had a great view of the dragonboat races in the early evening, the laser light show given by Marina Bay Sands and an unexpected fireworks show to end the night. I was hoping at least a manager on duty would've come out to wish us a happy anniversary since we did travel from the U.S. and select their place to spend our special day. I'm in the hospitality business, over 14yrs., so it makes a difference to connect with your guests, local or foreign. Regardless of the hiccups, we still had a nice evening celebrating

As a Singapore local this is a place I really enjoy bringing visitors for drinks! The view of the marina is impeccable! Drinks and food is expensive but I have to admit the Sunday Roasts are just delicious!!!!! Went recently with a group of friends and had the beef - it was so delicious!! Melt in the mouth with a massive Yorkshire pudding and delicious gravy!!! In fact we ordered extra!! Between us all we ordered all the roasts and everyone said they were good! As a tourist I would recommend going a night to catch the light shows and views of the marina.

I've been here twice - once for a department dinner and once for a department lunch. I'd say the best thing about this place is the great view you get of Singapore. You can see for miles from up here! Food was OK - dinner seemed better than lunch in my opinion. They got three of my group's orders wrong! I did also have a run-in with the reservations staff once for a lunch reservation. They require a credit card to guarantee a reservation for a group of 10 or more. Unfortunately, our group had to cancel the reservation about a day earlier and they wanted to charge us unless we could find them a replacement group for our reservation (?!!). They DO get a good office crowd so there should not have been a problem with finding replacements for our group. At the end it was sorted out but it left me and my group with a very bad 'taste' for this place. Don't take my review to heart though - I encourage you to eat there, especially at night when it's cooler and you can sit outside on the balcony with a glass of wine and savour the views
5
This is a working brewery but on top of Tower 1 in the Finance district. The food is excellent and the Wheat Beer is to die for. Once the sun goes down you are invited to take your dessert on the terrace overlooking the bar...wow! My wife and I spent a good hour eating our dessert and drinking wine (I couldn't resist another Wheat beer in my case). A thoroughly enjoyable and memorable evening but you'll need a bit of extra cash as it isn't cheap
5
We had no reservation and arrived around 6pm, asked for a table on the terrace which we were then put on a wait list, around 10 minutes later a table became available and there we stayed for the next few hours.Great view of the night show of the gardens by the bay as well as the laser light show from the Marina Bay Sands. The staff were very attentive, we just had bar snacks which were plentiful.Would recommend for the view and service and definitely go back again
5
You will find a number of really good craft beers (may be best in town) along with a fantastic view of Singapore. The atmosphere is modern with a nice setup with the beer vats behind the bar. This is a really nice place, put it on your list
5
I went for dinner with my wife and we had a great time nice please to talk dreams with your spouse enjoying the view ,across the amaizing marina bay sands hotel where we were staying with their laser show in the water
3
The only thing is the view/scenery.
Not recommended to try the food.It's awful.
just go to have couple of drinks will do.
3
The views from LeVel 33 are spectacular although on the day the went the smog coming over from Indonesia reduced what we could see. The restaurant is a fun place and the service was good but the food was nothing special.
4
Nice place at the 33rd floor (surprise...), with excellent beers (in-house made), good food and a fantastic view over the bay, can't miss it Note there is the light show on the bay at 8 pm every night, seen from here is worth the price (not low, above 100 US$ for a normal dinner
5
I was taken to Level 33 by a friend early one evening for drinks and dinner, and was simply astounded by the amazing view over Singapore. We had not booked, but requested a table on the outside deck area, and were relocated within 10-15 minutes. We had drinks and dinner - alcohol is expensive (but it is everywhere in Singapore due to the duties and taxes which are payable), but the food was very reasonably priced. We ordered 3-4 dishes to share and sat chatting as the sun set over Singapore, and then watched the amazing light display from Marina Bay Sands (make sure you look out for the remote controlled LED "kites" as well). Well worth a visit, particularly if you haven't tried it before, and the staff are professional and friendly which make the experience even better. Highly recommended

It was a sunny afternoon and due for a catching up with the buddy. Since we were in the MBFC / Asia Square vicinity, I suggested LeVel 33 Restaurant located at Tower 1 of Marina Bay Financial Centre. The lift lobby took us straight up to the front of the restaurant with great views of the CBD areaThe cozy, posh restaurant (by day) and lounge (by night) is done in lovely shades of luscious brown and sleek wood. There are several dining areas - bar counters and 2-3 different sitting areas all done in a sophisticated, contemporary design.They actually had the famous Ploughman's Table, lined with delicious selection of salads, charcuterie (cheese and accompaniments), mini pastries and fresh fruits. I was especially enticed by the section where there's piles of succulent-looking Smoked Salmon and bouncy, juicy looking Shrimps. Once we placed our orders, we could feel free to attack the counter which was buffet concept. One could pay SGD$28.00 just to eat from the counter instead of having the set lunchI preferred the lighter, fresher, healthier and sweeter range of appetizers such as Pink Grapefruit (very sweet and juicy!), succulent and springy Shrimp cocktail, and Salads of fresh greens. The Smoked Salmon, while being scrumptious and tender, was a tad salty in my opinion.My main was the Roasted Angus Sirloin sandwich - complete with onion marmalade, wholegrain mustard bread , arugula, fat cut chips and 33.1 Blond Lager infused ketchup. The bread was a little hard, but was a necessary texture to conquer the strong flavors of the onion marmalade and tasty minced beef steak - this steak was a neat delight of savoury and sweet blend.The fat cut chips would have been lovely if crispier.For more detailed information and photos, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/05/lunch-at-level-33-marina-bay-financial.htm

We managed to get completely lost in the underground shopping centre / subway complex on our way here, but I am glad that we persisted â€” this was our best meal in Singapore. We had reserved in advance, and that seemed to be sensible, since others were turned away as we arrived.The service was friendly and the food both tasty and substantial; no micro-portions here. We sat in the main restaurant, with a good view over Marina Sands, and there were plenty of people sitting on the balcony with drinks and nibbles.We had a thoroughly enjoyable meal here, and I would happily return should I be in Singapore again
4
enter by dedicated lift direct to level.Combination of brewery,bar and Restaraunt .If you're into boutique beers your in the right place :you can get a paddle of 5 different beers akin to flight of wines.Food was good but expensive for what you get.Well worth it for the view ,you can eat out on the balcony.I ran into a misunderstanding with credit card:mine was taken in exchange for a token.When I exspressed my concern I was informed it was standard practice in Singapore.A lack explanation that clouded our otherwise enjoyable evening
3
I'm being hyper critical but when restaurants aren't cheap they need to up their game. The food here is high end English gastro pub, nice but not great. The service again was fine but just not great, drinks arrive a little too slowly and the staff forget to smile.So what's good? - well the view for starters is amazing and worth having a table outside to enjoy it. The beer tasting menu is also fantastic - 5 beers of differing strengths/flavours to try. Don't miss it as the staff may forget to recommend it.This is an expensive option, you might consider going for the view or if you really don't like Asian food but there are so many better places in Singapore
5
Had some trouble finding this place - you almost have to know precisely where it is to have any hope of getting to it if you're from out of town. Spectacular views as you might expect. Fun to sit on the outside deck if availability and weather permit. Went for brunch one day - lots of the usual standard North American brunch fare but a lot of good south East Asian influences and choices. Very good service. Added a lot to our enjoyment of the trip
4
Nice beers and food was OK .... but the view was OutStanDing. Be there just before dusk and watch the lights come on ....
4
We had sharing plates and beer but everything was perfect.
Feel bit clouded with table and chairs and ceiling not too high. otherwise go outside and quite impressive outside.
I would like to go there next trip.
5
Great place, excellent view and food was well prepared. Our waiter, Michael was talking care of a number of tables but didn't tire to be attentive and helpful to all our wants and questions.Food came well prepared and tasted great. The view as always, is worth seeing. Lovely place, will go again
5
It really was one of the best meals we've had in Singapore! Food was mouthwatering, beautifully done, and worth every penny! We couldn't decide between Level 33 and Ku De Ta (restaurant on top of the MBS hotel), but were so happy with our choice in the end. It was a fine dinner at a great price-value ratio, amazing view, and very good service
4
We were perhaps lucky to get the table with a fantastic view of the Marina Bay Sands. But worth the effort. With four other friends the six of us had the best view of the sky line. Given you can't see the MBS when you're on top of it, this has to be the best place for such a view. The food is reasonably priced which makes up for the excessive price of beer and wine in Singapore. While you get used to the latter it is nice that the food is more affordable
4
For great views of Singapore or if you just want to impress your friends/visitors to Singapore, head to LeVeL33. The food is good, as are the choice of whiskeys, but the jewel happens to be the craft beers. They switch them around every so often, so worth a re-visit
4
I was there for a birthday meal however they don't offer complimentary birthday cake but charged for a slice of Cocoa Fondant which cost S$16 before tax. The microbrewery serves 5 variety of in-house brewed beer which is worth a try (they have the sample rack).Due to a promotion, i was recommened the Shakespere platter for 2 which is not too bad. The Lager Mojito which cost $25 before tax wasn't as tasty as any conventional mojito! In all, prepare to pay for about S$100 per pax. The atmosphere is rowdy on the weekend and getting reservation is necessary. Ask for a quite corner in-door as it is rather windy outside
4
One of my favourite places in Singapore. The view is great, over the water in front of MBS and of the City.The beer is always good but the cocktails are pretty poor, so stick to what they know. The service is ok, about 50/50 percent good/bad (typical Singapore style, have to ask for things twice)The food is very good but a bit on the pricey side, I went with another 3 guests and had a few beers with dinner which came to over S$600, a bit much but it always feels worth it with the view and lively atmosphere.Sometimes tricky to get a reservation and they also hv a no reservation policy during 'rainy' season plus minimum spend.I have been for a breakfast a number of times and it's a great all day breakfast platter ... the buffet lunch was good but nothing to write home about ... and dinner is always good with a beer in your hand

I guess most of the reviews here were given by tourist. But I am a local and I have patronised this place 3 times. The first time was here for beer and it was not bad with the stunning view as a backdrop. Dined here twice and it was a disappointment though. The first time I ate here was on 20 March 2014 with my boss. We ordered the Cod, Gambas and salad. My boss is a European and according to him, the gambas and salad were bland in taste. My cod was bland on top but salty below. The second time we came here was 4 April 2014 and for a friend's birthday. We were a group of 9 and we had a four course set dinner. The cold dishes were fine and I had Gnocchi for main. The problem is that the base was a bit sourish and there were barely strips of lamb shoulder. The server did offered to replace the dish for me but I already had a fair bit and therefore declined. The worse was the dessert. The cake was lumpy and dry. It was a disappointed experience indeed. But if you are going there for the inhouse beer, its not too bad
4
If you love food and beer, this is the place to come!Its awesome walking into the financial buildings and entering your private elevator to the 33rd floor!Upon the doors opening you walk into a copper filled entrance and you can already see the beer brewing kettles/vats and pipes!!The decor is rustic and fresh we absolutely loved the environment, and it was easy to forget you were 33 levels above the ground, until you looked outside and saw the beautiful Singapore skyline.The food is delicious and the beers ( please try the tasting plate!! ) were tasty! Salads and dessert were buffet style ( for lunch )! Very good value for money
4
I went to there with coworkes after the dinner.At the moment,F1 was holded.So, we enjoyed excellent night view with abnormal engine sounds of F1 machines.
We did not eat, just drunk. Should have mind to accept high cost to drink and stay.

Visited LeVel 33 for dinner on recent trip to Singapore. Although we had booked well in advance, our table wasn't available when we arrived so we were given a small table outside to have a drink while we waited. After a couple of drinks watching the darkness come down and the Marina area light up, there was still no table available so we ended up eating tapas style outside. Although not what we had planned, it is a stunning setting and we had a fantastic evening. It is pricey, but worth every $ for the views alone!!
4
We had dinner in the restaurant which is indoors, although you still get a bit of a view out of the large windows. It's a very nice setting and the combination of bar and restaurant meant that it had a lively atmosphere - fairly loud but just about manageable.They claim to be the highest micro-brewery in the world and they had a small but fairly interesting selection of beers. I wouldn't say they were great beers, but I liked them nonetheless and they were a welcome change from Singapore's perennial Tiger. I struggled a bit with the wine list because we wanted to drink a white and I'm a bit bored of NZ sauvignon blancs, so we ended up with an Australian riesling that was pretty mediocre.The menu was typical gastro-pub, with several dishes I'd have liked to try. I started with the smoked makerel which was pretty good but with a slightly curious underlying flavour. For the main course I had the black cod which was good but not outstanding. I had a side of maccheroni which was heavenly - definitely worth getting fat for! For pudding I went for the sticky toffee pudding which was also very good and a welcome addition to the waistline...Service was adequate but no more and the overall bill was pretty much in fine dining territory. Nevertheless I still liked the place and I'd certainly consider coming back
4
You don't go to Singapore without hearing two things: it's beautiful, and it's expensive. Both are epitomized in Level 33 - a microbrewery on the 33rd floor and overlooking Marina Bay. Make reservations, be prepared to pay $20 for a beer, and bring a jacket if you are going out on the balcony (which you should) as it can be quite windy up there. That said I think it is a better view than from the Marina Sands, and definitely worth a stop. Miserable service (>20 minutes sitting outside waiting to order a beer) (bad service seemed typical in Singapore though), beer was mediocre (but to be fair that's coming from a resident of the microbrew capital of the world, Bend, Oregon), but I would go back - just with lower expectations
5
We went there with a family member for a drink during the day. The view over Singapore is stunning. Make sure you sit out in the terrace. The service was excellent and the home crafted lager was very nice. I would love to visit there at night to see the lights
5
We recently enjoyed the Wine Paring Valentine Menu on our first evening in Singapore with friends. Although pricey, the food was excellent, service excellent and the view incredible. Roses on the ladies place setting was a nice touch. I am perplexed by other negative comments on the same evening, we had a great evening and would return without a doubt
5
After a very bad visit to the famed ku de ta at marina bay sands we stumbled across level 33 on an around me now app,Great views, great beers and cocktails, we only had tapas style foods for lunch which were great also. I really wish we had of came here first and I highly recommend a visit especially if you are into micro brewery beers.
4
I went to Level 33 during my recent trip to Singapore. I really liked this place as I had very good view of Marina Bay area. I had beer and stayed until there was lights. You can have very good view from here. food and service are okey thogh, its worthy because of its location
3
My hubby had arranged the Vday dinner here, and It was our first time visiting the Level 33.The location is good at the busy financial district which is easy to reach. Meanwhile, it is modern and stylish in design with a nice view of Singapore skyline.We had chosen the menu of Vday with wine pairing (SGD 118++ per person). Indeed, it seemed offering you so many choices on the menu but the ingredients weren't special nor precious at all. (Wondering why it costed SGD 118++ per person?) We had tried other restaurants the previous years for Vday that price could be lower, but do offer special and reasonable dishes. It was quite disappointing that it only had the choices of meat (beef/chicken) or cod fish (not even lobster nor other seafood choices). Portion was small (as expected). We had visited many french restaurants that also served small portion foods, but they do serve a lot of breads or other else to make up for the dinner. It is not the case here, we felt 'incomplete' after the dinner. Staffs were friendly though, they offered us some peppers for foods while we were (almost) finishing our main courses, which wasn't make sense to us...They offered different wines for pairing each course. Some of the names of wine were totally not familiar to us. We seek suggestion and introduction about wines, staffs also not sure about them. Perhaps we expected the staffs would be trained and prepared for Vday dinner? They didn't know what they were selling, which was quite nonprofessional... (we could choose the standard wine we know though). Quantity of wine in glass is really personal thing, but the amount of wine served in glass was definitely not up to standard (thought i was the drinker but hey, my hubby felt the same too!). From the menu, it looks tempting that different courses with different wines pairing, but in reality, it just served less than standard of wine with ordinary foods... :(In conclusion, definitely would not consider to visit here for dinner. Would consider to visit here just for drinks and the skyline view..
3
went here with colleagues, the view is very nice on marina bay sand, and the beer is good tooPlease do not order any thing else as it is very expensive and not good at allthe place is quite expensive.....Please make a reservation before getting there and request a table on the terrace otherwise you gonna miss the vie
5
If you want to enjoy some beers with your friends... this is the place to be... the view of MBS and Singapore river is awesome
1
This place is too hyped. The food is bad and the service is awful. The only thing commendable is the view overlooking MBS! So just grab a beer ...
5
Very good indeed. The food was very well cooked and delicious. The wine was excellent made better by good company. A really good atmosphere in the restaurant and would like to visit again.

I had the misfortune of visiting this restaurant for dinner on Saturday 1st of February for dinner with my girlfriend. We arrived on level 33 to be greeted by a hostess who did not for a single moment look up from her computer to greet or welcome us. Instead offering 'reservation name?' before pointing down the corridor to where we were meant to go.Upon sitting at our table we were presented with menus, and whilst I appreciate that you pay for the view, it was a very limited offering with our waitress informing us that several items were not available. When we asked for water if was poured into our glasses with the same guile and delicacy of touch that I would associate with empting a bucket of water. It was a further 25 minutes before we were able to gain the attention of a waiter to take our order. As he walked over to us it was promising until he raised a finger and said 'wait' before heading to the table next to us. I would understand this delay if the restaurant was busy but unfortunately it was thinning out very quickly. Eventually our order was taken but there were further delays in bringing out the food, noticeably the table next to ours had the same problem. The biggest disappointment however was that our table was directly next to a clearing station. This ordinarily, whilst unsightly, would not ruin an evening but the staff at Level 33 proceeded to robustly clatter, jangle and drop every plate and glass that they cleared. It was a constant distraction. To make matters worse, the restaurant was so quiet by the time our main courses arrived that there really didn't seem to be the need for the clearing station as the kitchen entrance was maybe 7/8 steps further away. It's a real shame having to write this review as we had actually been recommended to visit Level 33 will never be returning. We didn't mention anything to the management team either at the time as I was not looking for a reduced bill or free course, I simply wanted to eat my food and leave. Furthermore, the attitude problems and poor service encountered smacks of a deep routed issue that is not limited to one visit or table, as evidenced by the regularity of the negative reviews with regards service on here. The management team, I suggest, either do not know how to fix the problem or do not care. A really unfortunate experience, and such a black mark on the Rochester Group's portfolio, as their other establishments (1 Altitude etc) have always been excellent
4
A restaurant with it's own on-site brewery always gets my attention, and one with views over Marina Bay is a bonus, so I had high hopes for this place - and wasn't disappointed. I decided to go for the "fish and chips" - a tempura battered Dory fillet on fat chips - absolutely delicious! I also tried one of the Pale Ales whilst I was there, and that was also very good indeed - there is a great selection of beers. Not particularly cheap, but not many places in that part of Singapore are - but this beats most of them for the view
4
Well worth the effort, we booked in advance via Internet to get a balcony table. This area has a different menu than inside, more share items, but still excellent variety, just not the big main type. Staff quick and attentive, my husband had the mixture of beers and enjoyed the selection. I had cocktails mixed with stout, amazing very moorish. The only issue was that people who don t have balcony seating pushing around the table to stand a drink blocking view. I am sure this is not the the norm, but you do get some, my husband just asked them to move back.
4
A group of around 9 of us came here for a business dinner with guests from out of town. The view is really something, especially while watching the sunset and there's an excellent selection of wines. The food was exquisite - particularity the steak and the duck dishes. The best of all though? Easily the desserts which were heavenly, unusual (using such items as popping candy) and a fair size. Not cheap but you get what you pay for. Recommended for couples and business
4
Level 33, located at MBFC tower 1, is a highly recommended place for beer lovers in singapore. Though it offers expansive drinks menu but in-house beers score above all. A view of Marina Bay adds upto the charm to your evening. Ask for outdoor seating for best experience. The pub offers good range of western cuisine but vegetarians may be disappointed given limited choice.A perfect place for spend romantic evening with your special ones or simply chill out with gang of friends.Average beer costs SGD 10-1
5
The view is breathtaking I don't think any other spot can have such a Good view. And for the place, the view and the friends the prices are reasonable! As I said if you are in Singapore you must go there. better if it is @night
5
Our son requested LeVel 33 as the venue for his birthday whilst we were in Singapore over Christmas and New Year. My husband had already previously visited and as I am not a beer drinker I was a little less enthusiastic! We had the most wonderful evening, the food was excellent, stunningly presented and delicious. The staff were very friendly and happily supplied the necessary birthday candle in our sons dessert much to his embarrassment. I thought the sharing platters were a great idea. Unfortunately we managed to book the only evening in our two week stay that the heavens opened and the clouds came down low enough to touch the harbour front! By the time we were ready to leave the skies did clear and the view was spectacular, it would have been lovely to have enjoyed our meal on the balcony but it was not to be on this occasion. Although pricey - as are many eateries in Singapore - I would highly recommend for food and view and I the beer drinkers were very happy too
4
Got up with a reservation which was free, Beer was very nice and tasty, good prices for beer actually. Nice view from the balcony and a relaxed atmosphere!
4
Great views of the Marina Bay Sands area & reasonably priced.
Recommend booking in advance & reserving a table outside if possible. I would definitely go back!
4
Excellent food, excellent beer, excellent service and last but not least, an excellent view to accompany all of the above!!
5
What a view and lovely place with lovely welcoming staff everywhere trying to assist and serve everyone wherever they are in a lovely friendly manner.
Great for pre dinner drinks.

Visited Level 33 a few weeks ago while staying with a friend in Singapore. The view is pretty spectacular. It faces south and overlooks Marina Bay Sands and the water - what a cool city! The drinks were, as you might expect, extremely overpriced. Obviously you are paying for the view but the cocktail I had was weak and strange (a mojito with coca cola in it?) and my husband's beer was pretty flavorless. The staff were friendly but not super helpful with explaining how to get on a list for a table. We had a few different folks approach us and ask if we had reservations but were also told they don't take reservations - soooo overall not quite sure how that works. Basically I'd recommend this spot for the incredible view only (maybe share a drink with a friend before moving on)
5
Well I haven't had food at Level 33 but all I can say is that the drinks in combination with the amazing view over Marina Bay Sans to Chinatown is really REALLY good! I have been there with a friend watching the fireworks a few days ahead of the National Day and we really enjoyed being there. Plus they brew their own beer :)
5
My wife and I visited Level 33 for New Years Eve and what a fantastic night we had. First of all, as per what most people say, the view is amazing - with all the buildings around Marina Bay litten up it really is breath-taking, and you could sit there watching it all night. Our service was fantastic from the moment we arrived - drinks were delivered to our table almost immediately after ordering every time. Being a craft beer enthusiast the beer was right up my street and the red wine was very good also. The ploughman's table was a great idea for the starter - all the food was very fresh and extremely tasty. The main course was amazing with our steak and lamb shank cooked to perfection - the lamb literally melted in the mouth. Didn't have too much of the desert as we were busy taking in the views sitting outside on the terrace - but I did take out a mountain of macroons which were amazing. We will definitely be visiting Level 33 again next year when we return to Singapore
3
There is no doubting that LeVel 33 has the best views over Singapore'sMarina from its open air deck which was one of the main reasons for booking the New Years a Eve party which promised a night of lavish feasting at a pretty steep price (but then anywhere would be expensive on NYE). We had a great table right by the window and all the guests were alternating between sitting at the outside tables (which were not laid for dinner to allow everyone to get a good view of the fireworks) and going to their own tables.The 'array of canapÃ©s' that were served turned out to be three identical tartlets with different fillings - I'd expected much more choice and kitchen creativity. The starter was a buffet of seafood, cold meats and salads which was pleasant but uninspiring. Given that we were all there to celebrate NYE and had arrived at 7.30pm, we were in no rush and after our starter, we went outside to enjoy the views. We suddenly became aware that our main course had been served - we didn't actually want it at that point but were also not alerted to the fact that it was there. By the time we realised the food was cold. The staff were very apologetic and it was reheated and the lamb shank and mash were extremely good but it did rather take the edge off it. Dessert again was pretty bog standard and uninspiring. Craft beer and wine plus a glass of champagne were included in the price of the evening but I felt that they could have done a whole lot better

This place has an amazing view. We booked a table out on the terrace which overlooks Marina Bay. AMAZING. It was nice to sit back with a drink and see the laser show.Food was good. Our suggestion would be that the ploughmans platter should be served with some bread and the cheese platte with crackers. Drinks are pricey but that is common in Singapore (still can't get over the $17 + taxes for a bourbon).Service from wait staff was good however the person looking after bookings was quite rude.Overall worth a visit

Went there for a special occasion.Great view, though better views are had at the top of the Marina Bay HotelFood bland.... all of it - just totally forgetful and tastelessWine choices nothing specialOn all the table around people were suffering from device addiction... not talking to each other and on the table next to us, was a couple that must have spent 20 minutes taking pictures of each other and the food to post on Facebook? - when they did eat the food would have been cold but maybe they didn't care.. bizarre. It kind of sets the picture of the people that come to this placeDont bother with this place for the food.. ok view but as stated better elsewhereOh and don't bother with their micro brewed beers - tried these, you can do better with a home brew kit in the UK
4
Having lunch at here with family and kiddos was somehow not match. Place like fine dining, while kids rushing around. But hey, the view was great, food was great also..
5
Excellent view. Great for a casual drink either with friends or families
Food is okay. Very few vegetarian choice though
4
went there for a dinner with my girlfriend. service was not that good though. but the food served was tasty! the view of this restaurant is basically wonderful. overlooking the whole of singapore!the waiting time of the food was very long. took us almost 2 hours just for the main course to be served after my appetizer. asked the server numerous times but did not get back to me at all. the management should look into this service lapse issue
4
We went to dine here after making a reservation via the phone with a local friend of ours. The reservationist did call us back after we left a message and accepted our reservation at 20:30 instead of 18:30. Was able to adjust schedule so we attended.When we arrived our table was ready and we were quickly given the menu and explained the Specials for the Holiday Period. My partner had the Crustecaian (Sp) starter and I had the Beef tartare. which were both very good and well presented. During this portion of the meal my partner finished first and his dish was quickly removed before I had finished half of my starter. I also asked for some more bread to finish my starter. While waiting for the bread a waitress tried to remove my plate and I mentioned I was waiting for more bread. At this point I knew my main was probably already ready, and I was holding it up by not hurrying through th starter. This is a pet peeve of mine in restuarants, and something I am used to in the states, but was not expecting here. So be it,,,,finish my starter and enjoy the main course Back and Belly, which was an aged sirloin and beef brisket with a "sweet tasting" potato. Our friends Holiday Dish was very good and definetly a filling one.One always wonders why the rush, and as we work in the industry we can understand needing tables, making money in upselling, but if you are one of the last tables for dining that night what's the rush.We enjoyed the evening, yes the prices are on the steep side, but so is the view...but if the service had been a little more polished it would for sure would have helped make a perfect evening
2
Went with a group of 10 friends for dinner and drinks. Food was above average, views are great as is the restaurant's decor and while slow, service was generally good and polite. However, with an approximately S$5,000 tab we asked by the management to quiet down in a largely empty restaurant. While admittedly on the noisy side, we were not excessively so. We paid the bill and promptly departed to spend our money elsewhere. The restaurant's management should not expect to see any of us againâ€¦.Nor will they see any of our many friends..
3
Being on the 33rd floor in the marina bay area the views are stunning, however, this is the only real good point I found.The staff were friendly, the food was very average. There were six of us in total and all had something different to eat but none of us were amazed, which at the prices charged we were all expecting more.I tried a number of the beers which were good, however, not really chilled enough
3
Steaks are very nice, and the home brewed beers are excellent.Because of the location and the views, you do pay way over the odds though. Staff are very pleasant and courteous.Quite tricky to find though - even the taxi driver struggled. He had to phone them to get directions
4
Booked a private room as part of a business dinner. Certainly well looked after. Food was very good and they had roped off a private area on the balcony. Views over Marina Park are spectacular. Overall well priced and good quality. Local brewed beer was great
3
beer was lovely but i was waiting at the bar for 15 mins for change which was too long. when i opted for waiting staff order next order it was very prompt. views are really good. will go back and try the food next time. I also asked them to fill my beer up as the head was too big. this they did happily
4
Stayed there for dinner. Is a bit difficult to find but once there, you can enjoy a beautiful view. Take the apero on the terasse before you eat inside. Food is fair, not exceptional but good value for money (for Singapore). Decent wine menu as well but I assume many people try the various beers. Service was average but nothing to complain. Will come agai
5
We visited following a recommendation from a local in the area and it didn't disappoint! We had steak and chicken and both were yummy! We had sticky pudding and chocolate tart, delicious! Worth a visit if you fancy western style food with a view
5
Great place to go and have a few drinks o. He terrace whilst watching the free Marina Bay Sands light show. it's the worlds highest micro brewery and the beers good to.
5
I landed at 3.30pm and went straight to Level33 from the airport to meet a colleague. Arrive early to get a table outside (probably by 5.15pm) and try out the beers brewed on site in their microbrewery. It was my first time to Singapore but we stayed on a table outside until late. From the rooftop bar, I was shown the main Singapore landmarks and as night fell, my body clock immediately moved to local time. So when I left, it was only 4pm back home but I was ready for bed (no doubt helped by the micro brew!).
4
Ate here for lunch between flights, going through Singapore with a few hours to kill! Taxi took us to the wrong building, but we soon found it and were very pleasantly surprised. This restaurant was recommended by a niece, who has been living in Singapore for over 2 years. It is not fine dining, which is why it got 4 stars, but it is certainly up there for general dining. They have a wonderful, pub type menu, and also have their own micro brewery on site! I recommend their Blond Lager....very nice! Has the best large piece of deep fried fish that I have had in many a year, and the service was great, friendly, attractive and attentive, without being in your face. The salad bar was reasonably extensive and of high quality, although my wife was slightly disappointed in the sweet smorgasbord. I have no hesitation in recommending this restaurant, with reasonable prices, very good quality and a very personable Italian brewmeister
4
We had Sunday lunch here yesterday. There were five of us. Two of our party had roast beef and the other three had roast lamb, we followed it with cheese and biscuits.It was very good. We sat down about 2.30 to eat and after lunch took our drinks outside to admire the remarkable view. I think we left at about 7. We had a very pleasant afternoon
3
We were encouraged to visit LeVeL33 because of my husband's interest in craft beer. We arrived early at 6 pm on a weekend evening to be asked if we had reservations for drinks. We were seated outside only because we stated we would only be there for an hour. The view is amazing. Beer was good, just 5/6 of their own craft beers. We were not impressed with the hostess or the staff. No smiles, it seemed as if we were taking up their time! This was very unique to Singapore were we found every friend, warm and eager to be of service
3
We have been searching for a good Sunday roast dinner in Singapore and we still are! 3 of us booked a table in advance and admittedly we booked for 2pm, a little later than lunch time but they said they were serving until 5pm so we thought this wouldn't be a problem. However when we placed our order we were told the beef AND the lamb were sold out - only the pork and chicken were left. What they were serving by 5pm, I have no idea. When the food came I asked the waitress if the vegetables were coming too and she asked whether I'd ordered any. I replied that this was a roast dinner, they come with the meat. So then we had to order the vegetables separately but all that was left were the 'root vegetables', which consisted of a heated up mess of cheesy leeks. The pork was tasty but a little fatty, the roast potatoes weren't crispy though. The chicken was good. I had to ask for water 3 times...the wine was tastier! The views are amazing but I won't recommend this place just for that. And the cost is WAY over the top - they need to stop being so pretentious and focus on the food
5
Level 33 at the top of MBFC Tower 1 is a great place for a quick, simple business lunch, and of course a great spot for after work drinks. For lunch they offer a 3 course semi- buffet lunch with a choice of salads and cold cuts, and desert and cheese from the buffet, while the main course is ala carte from a choice of 5-6 items. Nothing fancy but it's all good - they have a great burger, steak sandwich, pasta, fish and chips and a couple of other choices. I've been here several times this year and the food is always very consistent. Service is also pretty good. As for after hours as mentioned this is a great choice. Nice view across Marina Bay, great drinks selection and array of finger foods. The signature gin & tonic and mojito are both highly recommended.
5
The restaurant is only accessible via the dedicated lift in Tower 1 but its well worth the visit. There is a set $33 menu with a buffet starter and desert table and a selection of 4 regular main courses and four additional courses which I suspect change regularly - in my mind very reasonable for what you get and the location. I visited it twice with clients and the service was reasonably quick, unlike some in Singapore restaurants that are glacial in their service, and the food was good quality and generous in proportions. The restaurant is also a micro brewery so some of the mains are beer flavoured. The views out from the restaurant over Marina Bay are excellent and for private meetings there are two glass walled rooms that can be booked. There is a good ambience to the place and I would recommend it to both business and tourists, although it is aimed at the business clientele
4
A microbrewery 33 floors up! Amazing views across the bay, tasty food and great beer to go with it. Service can be pretty slow at times, but that's pretty much indicative of Singapore! Not the cheapest of places but reasonable for the location. Worth visiting just for the view
3
somewhere my friends and i found from TA, was nice but expensive as everything is in SG.
We had a few special brews and it was alright.
4
The signature of Level 33 is the 2 copper stills at the bar. That's right, the beer is brewed in-house. The timber floor is a nice welcome, giving the whole place a sophisticated and warm ambience.We had the beers of course and it was rather nice and some bar bites of roast pork and other local snacks. Although the presentation was immaculate, the flavours were lacking and forgettable.The view of course was wonderful, overlooking Marina Bay to Ritz Carlton Hotel on the other side. I think Level 33 is a great place for drinks after work and the prices are reflective of the business district that Level 33 is in. That means, it is a little on the high side.Level 33 needs to improve the quality of the bar bites at least (we didn't stay for dinner), given the prices charged
5
This is an iconic location, overlooking Singapore's crazy marina which lights up at night with hourly laser shows. There is a great terrace if you want the heat and humidity or a cooler inside bar and restaurant. The views are superb and there is a succession of camera snappers on the terrace. You would definitely need to reserve to get a good spot. It really fills up after 6pm and it was rammed when we were there, in a nice busy buzzy way.But the great surprise is the quality of the food - really great tasting food in an amazing location
5
We visited this restaurant for dinner Saturday night and loved it. The views were fabulous and far better than Sky bar ontop of Marina Bay Sands.The staff were friendly and efficient - they arranged a table on the deck for pre-dinner drinks last minute and were very prompt with their service.The meal was fabulous as were the beers- sometimes microbrewery beers can be a bit hit or miss - these were spot on and delicious. The meats were high quality and were worth the price - the side salad was substantial. We were too full to have dessert but they all sounded amazing.For travellers or business - an absolute must
4
I been here for a dinner in a busy Wednesday night, the manager help us to find a table even if was full house. For all the night the service staff do great job!!For our dinner we start with1plate Scalop and 1plate of Pork andSnail, was ok but notthing specialFor mainBeef Tenderloin, the dalness was right but probably the quality of the beef not so good make it bit chewy..We finish with rhum baba I was not happy with that, was not really baba but kind of mini cake drop in a rhum!I will for sure go back but I guess next time just to enjoed the view and the beer.!
4
First you have to find it, of course. Then you realize that from a table outside you get one of the best views on Singapore Marina Bay. Watch the sunset and then the lights show in the bay, sipping local beers (it's a microbrewery) or cocktails. We did not stay for food, so recommendation is solely on drinks+view. If this is on your first evening in Singapore - as it was for us, straight from the plane - you fall in love with the city there and then
4
Whilst the food here sounds better than it is (it sounds amazing, but it actually just good), the location, wine, views and atmosphere make this a great place to visit early on your trip here to appreciate the buzz and the evening views over the bay. A truly unique vista. Make sure to book a table by the window or preferably outside. Being inside is pretty pointless as you cannot see much when you are sitting down
4
Level 33 is a brewery on the 33rd floor of the Marina Bay Financial Tower and the view is absolutely amazing. The beer and drinks are great and it's also nice that you can sit outside. We had some bread with dips, and the bread was really good but the dips were a bit wired. It would be a good place to watch fireworks over the marina.Overall I feel you should definitely give it a go whenever you are in the area
3
We (wife and I) made the trip specifically to enjoy the brewed on the premises beers and ales. The obvious initial choice was the tasting tray where we sampled all the currently available brews. Unfortunately, none of them lived up to expectations, in fact we couldn't find one that was enjoyable. They were all watery and lacking flavour and this was not because they were too cold (which can happen with some brews).Loved the views and didn't eat there so can't comment on the food.After just one beer each we left very disappointed. I really love good brews and dislike giving bad reviews but knowing a lot has been invested in this venture, perhaps a closer look at the recipes is in order. Ah well, back to the ever reliable Guinness on tap
4
Dined there several times as date nights and at lunch. It's one of the few place to get away from the crowd. Reservation is highly recommended. There is nothing so special about the food during the evening. The lunch buffet is worth the $$ when in Singapore for S$33-- high quality. The place is a micro brewery and the restaurant is beautiful. At night it's great to catch the laser light show from MBS. Dress code wise, if you are not familiar with Singapore, cocktail attire is recommend if you don't want to look like a sloppy tourist. Definitely recommend when in Singapore for the breathtaking view
5
Yes it is on the expensive side, but if you want craft beer with one of the most amazing views from a bar in Singapore, then you must visit here. We didn't eat but the food looked perfectly acceptable.
5
The food and the service in this restaurant is excellent, worth every penny. Try to book a table on the balcony to enjoy the great view this place offers.
1
Honestly the worst restaurant experience I have had in Singapore over the past five years. Service was beyond bad for the prices charged. Management was completely ignorant/arrogant. View does not make up for it. Do yourself a favour and steer clear of this place.
2
Great views! Table of four.
Waitresses wouldn't rate a job at McDonalds, 'service' was non existent. Food ranged from (1 dish) inedible,(had to be sent back) to bland, but edible, (2 dishes) to delicious (1 dish). Overall experience dreadful, embarrassing and expensive. Don't go there!
4
Great views, great food and a must go for everyone visiting Singapore and wants a relaxing yet exciting end to the day. The different beers on offer are also excellent. A little expensive but then this is Singapore.
4
We went for drinks and the view. We were last in Singapore 15 years ago, and this bar gave us a great opportunity to see all the changes. We sat outside early evening, and had good service. It is slightly odd going into an empty office building as we went at the week-end, but the sights from the outside tables were great. Worth finding it if you are only in Singapore for a brief visit
3
The first time I went to Level 33 (for a business lunch) I was overwhelmed by the quality of the view, food and service. Since that time I have been back on a number of occasions. Most recently last week. I was entertaining some of my overseas colleagues on a weekday evening. First the positives: the booking was well handled and we had an excellent table with a perfect view of the bay. Unfortunately it was down hill from there. The first Et down was the service which was abrupt, cold and unwelcoming (very embarrassing when you want to impress guests). The food was really ordinary. I had the carpaccio followed by the fish. Both were ok but not great value at the prices charged. One of my colleagues had past a and another had risotto. Both were no better than you would expect from a basic neighbourhood pizza joint.Overall, this continues to offer one of the best views in town. I would recommend for a drink and some bar nibbles but there are better places if you are after quality food
4
Level 33 makes you feel like you're on the scene of an action movie, glamorous restaurant, high in the sky above famous city. Luckily we didn't have to jump as I left my Union Jack parachute at home this holiday! Manoli and crew at Level 33 Brewery, 33rd floor of the Marina Bay Financial Centre meet you half half way with the menu, that is to say there's an entree buffet, you can choose your main and then it's back to the buffet for dessert, all fixed price - as always the wine's the bill killer. The entrees were a great selection of cold meats, smoked salmon, some oysters and salad, myself and two friends all chose seafood mains and then it was back to the buffet for a great selection of cake and fresh fruit. We started with a few of the house made pilsener and moved on to some yummy chablis with our fish. The staff were great, chef was passing and stopped to say hi and we left paying a bit more than $100 each... all in all great value, don't miss out if you're in Singers. BTW, unless you really feel the need, it's a lot more relaxed and enjoyable than the restaurants up at Marina Bay Sand
5
This was one of the most enjoyable dining experiences I have had in Singapore (assisted greatly by being a business dining event). The seafood platter to share was excellent - it would have been phenomenal without the freshly opened tin of anchovy...The beef was outstanding, and the portions were perfectly sized. Most importantly, the beer was wonderful!Would definitely return, especially as a company event
4
Although price is considered on the high side but it can be compensated with - the view of SGP skyline and landmark like Marina Bay Sand, SG Flyer, etc.... - the food is decent but it would be better if you come as a group and order their platter for sharing.- good selection of beer and it is really nice as it can go along pretty well with the food menu.SO What else do you need on Friday night!?!
4
Simple menu, but well executed and excellent anti pasti starter selection with some alternative salads. Great view across the bay to keep you entertained if the conversation breaks up.
4
If you like beer and dining with a view this place is it. The worlds most scenic, in terms of aerial views, brewery. Great beer, good food but prices to match.
4
Visited Level 33 for a business lunch last week, with a team of four. Great location. For a set menu lunch around SGD35 you couldn't ask for better value. Help yourself at the bar for starters that consisted of cold meats and salads. Order your main meal (choice of 3 or 4 from memory) and finish off with a limited selection of dessert and cheeses at the bar again. Coffee was very good as was the service and overall experience.Will return for future business lunches
2
The location is absolutely perfect. A beautiful view on the whole Singapore Skyline. The management could make a big success out of this but a clear choice should be made: either be a nice bar with good snacks OR be a good restaurant with good quality dining. Now it is a compromise at both concepts. The food and wine menu suggest good quality dining (Main dishes +$45, Mouton Rothschild wine list, Glass Champagne $30). For these prices I expect a good looking table, professional service maybe a table cloth.We went for dinner on the terrace and groups of drinkers were just hanging around our table (mix bar & restaurant). This is not what we expected for a $350 Dinner for 2. Then the food was so so. I ordered the Beef&Reef ($49) and asked for the beef to be medium-rear. I was served an overcooked prawn in white pudding (sauce?). The beef was at most medium but closer to well-done. When I sent the beef back the chef started arguing if about it. Non really appropriate to discuss with customers like this.We were disappointed and would not go again, or maybe for a drink but not for food
3
I have to qualify this review by telling you I live in Canary Wharf and I've also been to LeVel 33 before - last Christmas. It was quieter then and a much better experience. Last week on Thursday evening part of the bar was hosting a reception for a well known bank. It was very busy, and reminded me of some of the bars in Canary Wharf on a weekday evening.However, the views are fantastic but the drinks expensive. We didn't eat here
5
I believe this is the spot where I could see the best view of Singapore at night. I visited with a coulple of friends (who visited it before) and we absolutely enjoy the stunning view of Marina Bay Sands and the river below. There is also a water performance at night which is really nice even though we couldn't hear much of the music. It should be one of the best places for couples if you wanna take your partner to a place to blow their minds away.The staff is nice and friendly with profressional service. I highly recommend to sit outside so you can enjoy the view (it's basically the same with any other bar if you choose to sit inside). We came at around 9pm so there was no seat outside left, but they put us on waiting list and served right when it's available. So if you're up to an outdoor bar this is definitely a place to go.I order a beer with chocolate (forgot the name) with the price around S$ 15 tax included
5
If you don't want to eat or drunk just cone here for the views. Where else can you see two other countries at once from one building??Aside from views, everything else was...fine. Food and drink are way overpriced. Some of the smaller appetizers or sides were tasty like the corn. My scallops were too rubbery though. And portions can be huge!There's a brewery in there so expect to smell yeast. The staff are nice. And the atmosphere is lovely
5
I met a few friends here after work for a couple of drinks (beers of course). The views are amazing. The brewery is impressive. The beer (I only stuck to the one kind- blonde) was lovely. The service was great. There is a restaurant too, which I would like to try next time I am in Singapore. Would definitely recommend!
4
LeVel 33 is awfully good.Best value on the current menu is the shoulder of Lamb for four to six people for only S $135.Apparently a shoulder like the one we were served, would cost a chunk in the supermarket, so to have it 33floors above Marina Bay in a posh place was a bargain. It was delicious. Great place to view the upcoming Formula 1 in September.One downside. No round tables. We had dinner for eight in a straight line. Not great. Also Tourists beware what the locals call plus plus. 7% GST and 10 or 12 % service adds a lump on to the bill, but that is everywhere in Singapore.Great fun, will go back.Packed on a Monday night. Expat heaven
4
It's a great rooftop bar with a sensational view of Singapore skyline. Other alternatives with equally incredible (or even better) views are the rooftop bar on top of Marina Bay Sands (Ku De Ta) and 1Altitude bar. Ku De Ta has an unreal view, but it's a bit weird to hang around up there if you're not staying at the hotel. Level33 balcony deck is a nice spot to enjoy a few of their own microbrew beers. I've had most of the beers that are usually available, and liked all of them. They also mix a decent gin and tonic. Prices are inline with Singapore generally, but not exorbitant like some of the other establishments catering to western tastes
4
Went there for lunch to meet some friends. The view was very good and the food equally good. Also reasonably priced for a high end Singapore place - with a 3 course set meal for about $30.
4
Second time here and had a great time. It is expensive but worth the money. Great view, really nice food and attentive service. Not a place you would hang out all the time but perfect for entertaining visitors to Singapore. Will definitely return.
3
We been to Level 33 last Saturday for my post bday celebration. The review was true that the staff here are snobbish. Had a bad experience n do not order their king prawn as it's overcooked. I had send a feedback to the staff. They had a efficient GM where they respond to you fast. Overall this place service needs to improve
5
Great place to go for a fantastic view of Singapore. Stay for drinks on the patio or dinner inside.Level 33 brews a good selection (for Singapore) of beers on-site. They have a happy hour.Limited menu of very good food. A steak is going to cost around $45. Most other main courses are in the $30-40 range. Sides are extra.Wine and mixed drinks may seem expensive but are about on par with other good restaurants/bars in Singapore.Our table staff were great. Very polite and courteous. I would recommend Level 33 to friends and plan to go back
5
This is a brew restaurant which makes their own beer. And the beer is very good. My wife and I showed up with out a reservation and at a time when the place was busy. They were very nice to accommodate us very quickly and sat us outside as we requested. We both had steaks and a few brews. Our steaks were cooked perfect and they came with a side which I don't recall what it was. The food is excellent and is priced a little high, but this place has a high end feel to it, so it is what we expected. The place has an awesome view looking over Marina bay and the "ship". During dinner we got to watch the nightly laser show and even had a nice Cuban cigar after. This is not a place to be missed when in Singapore. Great food, great view, great beer, great cigar, what more can you ask for
4
This place definitely has one of the nicest views of Singapore, and I highly recommend you get there about 30 ~ 40 mins before sunset to see the sky change colour - it is really quite spectacular. I'm not a beer drinker so I tried some of the red wines, which as you may know, in Singapore, can be a hit or a massive miss, however Level 33 has consistently provided good quality nice wine. My fiancÃ©e loves his beers and likes the fact that Level 33 provide decent good quality ales, which is also difficult to get in Asian countries. The staff have always been nice and accommodating, last time we came there were no tables available outside, but we were just happy to stand and look at the view. The table next to us was reserved and we asked if we could sit until the customers came they were obliging and even provided us with extra seats
1
It's true that this place has an awesome view of the Singapore skyline. It's one of the places I'd definitely recommend to friends who are visiting, or so I used to think.A couple weeks ago, I was there with a friend who was visiting. It was a weekend night so it was pretty crowded. There were no seats at the bar. A huge part of the outdoors area was closed off for some private event, and the remaining two tables were taken. It was pretty crowded but I encouraged my friend to go to the ledge to get a view of the scenery. We were there for less than ten minutes before a waiter came and told us not to stand there because"You are making my customers (the ones seated at the table) feeluncomfortable."I was flabbergasted by the comment and felt embarrassed that my friend was treated with such obnoxious attitude. True that we didn't spend as much money as the people at the table, but that doesn't make us any less of "their customer".I think the comment was rude, insensitive and discriminatory. It was a very unpleasant experience and we left shortly
5
Moved to Singapore at the beginning of the year and one of my first places I was taken to was Level33. I must admit I hate to become a regular at any place but find Level 33 to have all that I love and then some. Great food, beer and a view that is fantastic. A great place that also has a great atmosphere
5
Went as a group of 5 girlfriends here. Service was both attentive yet friendly. Food was excellent. One member of our party ordered two starters as a main course and this was accommodated without question. Wine quite pricey, food well priced for its quality. Atmosphere is chic but casual. Lots of people in the bar area clearly straight from work. We stayed till they politely threw us out as the lift was closing (around midnight!) One of the best views in Sg. If you're eating in the restaurant, be sure to wander outside and take a picture
4
This was our special dinner to treat the friend we'd been staying with in Singapore. Level 33 was her choice and it would be mine now for a special celebration if visiting Singapore. My beef steak was excellent. My partner started with scallops, cooked and seasoned perfectly. The wines by the glass were good quality. Level 33 is also a micro brewery
4
Tasty food, great location, fantastic view of the harbour. Great place to meet friends for drinks and food.
5
Very nice place to have evening drinks when sun starts to get down. Over polite and helpful staff :) They brew their own beer, it is worth a try!
4
This is the post card view! Food and drinks were good but we were all focusing on the view! Sit outside if possible.
4
We have been with family and friends several times to this restaurant, mainly for the amazing views of Marina Bay, Gardens by the Bay and the evening light show. Yes it is expensive and you have to be careful to get a table with an unrestricted view, but perseverance pays off! We always start with drinks on the balcony, so we can watch the sun set and lights come on. It can be windy, so watch out for flying clothes and hair.Starters and mains are of a good size and well presented. The wines are extensive, but indicative of the usual Singapore rip off - little worth having under SGD100. I don't think we have ever had bad service and if you're lucky, you will get another expat (like the Australian we had), with whom to share jokes and banter.Definitely worth a visit, if you are prepared to pay the prices

OK granted, the place is expensive but then Singapore is very expensive in general and you go to Level 33 for the view of the harbor (Marina Bay) and skyline from the 33rd floor on which the place is located. You will not be disappointed by that because the view is absolutely superb! We went for drinks only and were lucky because the weather was great and could stay outside enjoying the panorama. The place was totally full and very hectic when we were there midweek but the staff could improve their attitude

We came for "Sunday Roast" back in December and will not be coming back. For the prices we paid for food, I am shocked at how poor the staff was at accommodating us and the petty attitude. I have two anecdotes to share from this experience.1) The restaurant opens at noon on Sunday and we arrived promptly at noon for our reservation. We were the first and only customers at this point and were welcomed to a completely empty restaurant. The hostess sat us, oddly, at a table where the view was obstructed by a large window beam. I asked to be moved to the next table over where the view of Marina Bay Sands would be completely unobstructed. The hostess refused, explaining that this was the table we were reserved. Huh? I looked around - we were still the only patrons at the restaurant at this point. I pointed out no one else was here yet and we were the first to arrive. Why couldn't we move to another table? She hemmed and hawed without giving a reasonable explanation, then tried to explain that because of when we made the reservation, the "system" had assigned us this particular table. Really? So because the "system" said so, we were forced to sit there, even though there were about 15 other tables available to us? She really was shackled to the "system"? Have to question the out of the box thinking skills here...2) My husband and I were waiting for our friend to arrive, who had already informed us he would be late. We had each been given a complimentary piece of bread. As we were waiting for our friend before ordering, we asked the waitress (different lady from the hostess above) whether we could have more bread. The response? "Sorry, it is one piece of bread per customer." Wow - for a higher end restaurant with such a nice view and atmosphere and steep prices, I never would have guessed such a policy. Totally petty! This isn't a hawker center, it's a nice restaurant. Time to act like a nice restaurant and give your paying customers some more bread!For the price we ended up paying, definitely not worth returning. If the food had been amazing enough to make up for the poor service attitude, then maybe...but we all agreed the food (at least at Sunday Roast) was pretty average for what we paid

Second time here. Food was great. Expect mains ala carte from SGD$35++They have their own microbrewery. Had the Blond Lager - light and great tasting.1 pint from $18++ (after 8pm, cheaper before then)There's an outside area where you can sit and drink. It's cocktail type tables, and fairly windy so I won't recommend to have a sit down dinner especially when you're trying to eat and hair's flying around.But just drinks would be perfectMake reservations (at least 2 days in advance) if you want good seats. Even on a weekday, the place is packed!Dressing: don't think they are too particular. No slippers/ shorts. Jacket/tie not necessary. Guys have come in jeans + polo shirts + shoes
4
Location and scenery are excellent, recommend to hire an engineer to look into a draught shield (it will offset the money they are losing to blown off glasses).Food-wise they are trying but not yet there although quality of ingredients is fine. The microbrews are tasty. Service is disoriented, untrained and managed to douse my jacket in hot olive oil and soy sauce. Seems to be a regular occurrence as it did not trigger any sincere endeavour to correct the problem.
4
Went here around sunset for drinks and the light show. Very cool place! The view is tremendous and service was prompt and professional. Beer was good not great but you are more there for the view. I hear the food is very good but I didnt try any, If you get there before 8PM the beers are a few dollars cheaper. Very expensive about $10 for a beer but on par for Singapor
4
Made a reservation week before thought was full but lucky did manage to get a table for 2 on Sunday night, weekends would be a challenge if you book last minutes. Is 10 mins walk from Raffles Place MRT station. Just keep following the exist J or MBFC tower 1. They have their own private lift to the restaurant. When we reach waited for a minute before we bring attend by the hostess which busy with the phone.We were direct to our table just beside the window. The view was stunning. We asked if we could change our seat to outdoor but the servers informed is only for snacks and drinks only, dinner have to dine in house! So we decide to have some light snacks and drinks outdoor before the dinner. The food portion were small for the snacks. I have a festive ale from the microbreweries and my fren had martini. After the snacks we decide proceed in for our dinner! Food portion was just nice taste very good! After the main course the servers would happily transfer our table back to the outdoor, enjoying the night view very much!!! The breeze can be strong and cold during night time especially after rain. Overall the visit was great! Service is greasy as probably they were not too busy after all is only a quarter full! But it still a bit pricy. Go before 8pm to enjoy thir happy hour
3
Used to have the business set lunch several time. The quality of the good and the service are just so so but the view is just thrilling. Will go there again not for food but for the view.
5
Exceptional place to sit down, enjoy quality beer and appreciate amazing view of Singapore. Staff was very friendly and welcoming.
4
Well recommended to me and had a great time. Great locations with views over the gardens and Marina Bay. The beer is cold and great and the Sunday roast is well worth the front and the money. Great little venue, can be busy after work on weekend but worth it
4
Met friends here for drinks at an outside table. Despite being on Level 33, the balmy Singaporean weather means the temperature is very pleasant. The views are amazing and you have a grandstand view of the light "show" from Marina Bay. Can't comment on the food as the place was packed and no table was available
4
Up to level 33, view is fantastic: over looking Marina Bay. Always goes up there for drinks, snacks, and the view. Main course is bad therefore during my second visits onwards we dont dine anymore. Sit outdoor for drinks to have great view instead of indoor.Thanks

Christmas meal at LeVel 33. I had a Scandinavian-style seafood plate, which probably was a mistake, since I knew how the sauces to gravlax etc. are "supposed" to taste, and it wasn't quite like back home. It felt like some ingredients came from a tin. My husband's meat was nothing special either, and the heavy air-conditioning disturbed our dinner a lot. Good food, but nothing that you'd remember after a couple of days. On the positive side, the house beer tasted great, and the view was spectacular. I'd say this is a perfect spot to have a beer, enjoy the sights from the balcony and upload a photo to Facebook to make your friends jealous

Thursday, 17/1/2013I'm a local. I ordered their wedges and 2 tall glasses of their house beer. $51 SGD. They brought the bill and took my payment but didn't return the change (albeit less than $2).I HAD TO WAIT 20 MINS for my wedges to arrive. This was at 9.30 pm after dinner hours. Very slow service in that aspect. I had to remind them no less than 3 times. I left without my change by the way.Positive:The view was decent though not the best due to several large obstructing pillars. They did do well in getting us a seat outside despite not being on the waiting list. The female staff were polite and visibly more eager to help than the male bartenders and the other male staff. Good environment to unwind, relatively quiet
4
The views from this microbrewery in Tower One of MIFC are brilliant. Not as high as the Skypark at MBS but then no queue and no paying for the privilege. Beer is high quality. The Sunday lunch (whole roast lamb shoulder) is something everyone should try with some friends
4
Loved it! the good food, great vibe and the city lights made this an exceptional evening. Ok so there are restaurants with better food but this view is not to be beat and I'd come again for sure! Friendly and obliging staff who are well versed with helping take photos of you with the gorgeous skyline backgroun
4
We originally went here just after it opened and although the view was spectacular the food and service didn't match up. How things have changed! Every dish ordered by our party of four was exemplary - from the mushroom ravioli, scallops, pig and snail to the salad. Main courses of gnocchi with lamb, veal; and black cod were equally delicious. Service was quick, friendly and efficient. The fact the restaurant was packed on a weekday night is testament to the quality. We will definitely be back. This is a great place to see the fantastic views across the city - just remember to book
5
The beer was good and so was the food. The service was top-notch and p.rice was well worth it.
The best thing about this restaurant is the view of the Marina Bay
4
Went with another couple. We had a great time enjoying good food without being spectacular. The view of the Singapore Marina was spectacular, the best I have seen. Try to book a tale in the terrace.
4
It's a great place for after office hanging out. The house brewed beers are great. Business lunch is also quite nice. What is the most special is to enjoy a drink with spectacular view of marina bay especially from twilight onward. Love the place.
4
Great place to hang out for an informal dinner. Large selection of food. They brew their own beer, really good beer.
The terrace is simply amazing and gives a great view on the Marina Bay Sands area
4
A little bit pricey but give a great view of the bay. All day Say breakfast at $25 is pricey but one of the best I've eaten in Singapore (and I have eaten alot!) Hard to get a seat on a Friday afternoon/evening but a Sat arvo is all good. Weekdays set lunch is value for money and as a Loooooong lunch venue it is great if you have a good healthy wallet. Micro brewed beers are tasty and make a change from the normal bottled varieties in town. Cheeky suggestion is if you are shopping or checking out MBS, park at MBFC tower, pop into LeVel 33 either before or after. We did it over christmas and it was a welcome oasis in a sea of shopping turmoi
4
We had heard about LeVel 33 through a friend and decided to check in for some drinks only. The elevator from the office lobby is quite slow and needs some patience, but the welcome by a smiling and very friendly hostess makes up for it. We wanted to have drinks only and she apologized that no terrace table was available, but she immediately offered us counter seats inside with the promise to move us to the terrace once a table would become available.A waiter took over and we ordered their signature Hendrick's Gin and Tonic, which has quite a price tag at S$ 28. To our surprise the waiter then asked as if we wanted to open a tap and requested our credit card as a guarantee. That somehow put a real damper on what had so far been a pleasant experience. Why would they need a credit card to open a tap? The place was not crowded or overly busy at all and if you wanted to run you would have to first wait 10 minutes for the elevator anyway? That didn't make sense at all, but we agreed and received a plastic tag with our table/seat number on it. A little odd!However, we quickly forgot about this issue when our drinks arrived. A smart presentation of a Hendrick's Gin and Tonic with a miniature Hendrick's bottle and properly cut cucumber in the glass as it should be. It didn't take long and a very friendly waiter offered us to move outside without any reminder or asking and that was a nice touch. Stepping out on the terrace is the moment when you really get to see what makes this place so unique. The view is stunning and it is one of the few places where you get to see the bay 'from the other side'. Since they brew their own beer, I didn't want to miss out and ordered a pint of Stout, but that was quite a let down. It had a slightly chemical aftertaste and I wouldn't be able to recommend it, but for a proper judgement I would probably have to try a few more beers. Anyway, the rest of the experience was round and smooth and overall it was a very nice evening with an avoidable glitch (the credit card tap). I think it is worth a visit
4
Only went for a drink and must say that in mine opinion this rooftop bar has the best view of Singapore of all skybars. Had the luck to enter just after a rainshower so the outside terrace was empty and got the best seat in the house. Cocktails and service where great. Small warning the taxistand outside is pretty crowded so make sure to order a cab
5
Dined here with a large group during a business trip. The lamb was the best roast I had in a long time. They brew their on beer which you should certainly taste. Very nice view across the Marina Bay. Very friendly staff who were at our beg and call
4
A comfortable and pleasant place to be at when seeking a place for night relaxation, light bites of food and freshly brewed beer. Staff were prompt and able to deliver the service with speed and ease. The night view across Marina Bay - worth a trip to this place
3
Pity that my first resto review would be so negative, but that's unfortunately usually what triggers someone to put pen to paper so to speak.Booked online and requested some birthday words on a desert which they took care of. Got a nice window seat and had a nice view of the MBS and Marina bay area.Food was not too bad, although the desert was dry and the non meat elements (mash etc.) of the mains were cold, but the meats were tasty. Portion size was reasonable but not large. The beers were ok, although the pale ale is very malty, a bit of a surprise but quite drinkable.That's where the good stuff ends. Given the prices involved I feel I had higher expectations of this place for service.Unfortunately the service we received from our hostess was so bad that initially we were laughing at it, but by the end, frankly we couldn't wait to get out as it just became annoying. I wasn't expecting a 5* experience, but i was certainly not expecting a food centre.I can't say I have ever had a drink coaster frisbee'd onto the table in a restaurant, nor experienced a total lack of acknowledgement for anything we asked for both during ordering and during the meal. I was surprised that our server managed to give the wrong meal to the wrong person on a table of 2, but the audible sigh and total silence when I asked for more pepper and a shaker that worked was quite annoying.Top that off with our server spilling our wine, saying nothing and just wandering off leaving us to wonder if we should use our napkins to clean it up ourselves ? (she did eventually return to wipe it up minutes later). Finally, after all this and paying my bill, not a "thanks" not a "see you again" just a stoney silence - I generally see better service at Macdonalds.Sad to see that such bad attitude and service would ruin such a lovely view of the Marina. Sent polite but direct feedback to them via their feedback email address and received no response - says it all really.Take your money elsewhere if you are looking for a service oriented dinner and/or just drop in for a beer + snacks on the balcony and enjoy the view
5
The food is really good and the service is excellent, with a spectacular view of the Marina Bay area. Just awesome! Must definitely recommend to anyone.
5
A very enjoyable birthday lunch with the family.
The service was efficient and very pleasant.
The traditional Sunday roast with a modern twist was delicious and the dessert likewise.
I will be back, one day.
5
Great views of Marina Sands, and Singapore in general. Menu, offers tapas style bar snacks, which can be enjoyed from the open balconies,with a smoking section.
4
Home brewed beers, excellent meats and sides and wonderful deserts, in front of the whole of Singapore.
4
This restaurant has a breathtaking view. The only reason I did not give full marks, was because the food wasn't quite up to amazing standard. However with so many beers to try, overlooking Marina Bay, the food is not so much of a concern!
4
This is a typical corporate watering hole, as it is set amongst the Marina Bay Sands Financial Sector, so if you go Mon - Fri after 4pm, dont be surprised to be surrounded by suits! Beers are brewed on site and the views offer a different vantage point which are stunning. Make a reservation if you want a seat outside as these are the first to go
5
The ambience was very upscale and cool for our business dinner. On the 33rd Floor of the building, the whole wall facing the Harbor is glass, with an expansive outdoor patio with breathtaking views of the city. The food was very good, and the pricing was pricey but not 'over the top' for this type of client experience. The staff was very friendly and it was an excellent experience
3
I have visited Level 33 several times. Tonight was the first mid week visit after work. The place got very busy after 630pm champagne was not cold. Not what I would expect for 29 a glass. Food service was slow and waiter disappeared after a while. Too busy serving other tables. Salad was very salty and was left untouched. Waiter did not even ask if anything was wrong or offer to take it off the bill. I would have second thoughts about bringing someone else there for dinner. It was disappointing.
3
The view from the balcony on the 33 floor is breath-taking.We had a good appetizer served on plate. The main course with beef was definitely overcooked. Service is okay, but not exactly amazing and – at least when we were there – understaffed.Enjoy the beer and the view
4
We have been a few times with visitors to show them the view and the beer and drinks selection are good, but the food is expensive for what you get. My husband and I had three of their bar nibbles a coke and fizzy water and the bill was S$90 too much. We will go back for a beer or two just not have the food
5
Lovely restaurant with outside balcony that has an amazing views. We had the shoulder of lamb to share. It was delicious. Price wise it's not your average place so expect to pay for the privilege.
4
Enjoyed a nice meal, reserved outside table and had front row view for laser light show
The menu has many choices not typical for Singapore.
The atmosphere is the best
2
Title probable says it all.
SG$20+ for a beer, and I detest places that quote the price exclusive of tax and service.
I got a few good photos and had one pint then left.
5
Really enjoyable place with a fantastic view. Book one week in advance to get a table outside and spend and amazing night with Cold Beer, fantastic view and an excellent fine food.
2
Great location with great views but appalling and incompetent service... Enjoy the view while they bring the wrong drink to to the wrong table and completely forget the food order. Reserve a table to find no table... But enjoy the view because it's great...
5
I have been here several times and will go back many more.A very pleasant mixture of great views, good wine and beer bar as well as good, simple food.The HUGE piece of pork is well worth ordering but I have not been disappointed by any of the dishes I have tried here.You have to book (usually) and the service is great. If you arrive a little early - no problems. Grab a beer (from their micro brewery or a branded one) and enjoy the view from the terrace while you're waiting.They also have a good selection of wines and hold wine appreciation sessions there too.Well worth a visit
5
First of all: the LeVeL is not a walk-in restaurant. You want to reserve a table. Once inside the Marina Bay Financial Tower 1 look for the side elevator. This will bring you up to the 33rd floor. Stunningly enough, the beer is brewed right here, behind the bar, on top of the world!The beers made will change from week to week, so make sure to check online what is available. The LeVeL sports a large L-shaped balcony with stunning views of the Marina Bay and over to the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. The food is high-end cuisine, which comes, especially in Singapore, at a price point. In this sense, the LeVel is among the high-end locations in Singapore. If you are not a beer person, try the gin-tonic
5
They only take reservations inside, but as you get there, they will do their best to find somewhere outside to sit. The wine they serve by the glass is good, and the right temperature (doesn't happen often in Singapore). Their home made beer is very nice, not to strong in flavour. Food is good, but some of it is quite creative. Would read the meny quite carefully if you don't "eat everything". We had the seafood platter to share as starter, which was exciting
4
As an American, I really enjoy a good micro-brew. When I heard about Level33, I had to pay a visit as it's the worlds highest brewery in the world. Dropped in an really enjoyed some of their brew creations. The GM (Carsten) actually made time to come over and say hello and as a big beer guy, he was able to answer all my questions and gave me a card. Looked as though they were doing a big private event with wine tastings and looked like the service never skipped a beat. Overall, the beer, service, view, and staff were very impressive. Definately worth the trip! (located in Standard Charter building)
4
The restaurant is loacted at marina bay financial centre, daytime full of bankers and corporates:) but if you wish to have a nice and peaceful outing , go for dinner. The view's stellar! at night you feel you're in a a galaxy , surrounded by stars. The food is good. Evening will be well spent in every way
4
One of the Best Singapore rooftop bars. Amazing view and great service. This place gets busy in the evening so please make the reservation in advance. I enjoyed the drinks especially the bees brewed on location but the food was average.
5
Amazing view, great service, wonderful beer and food what more could you want! Would definately go back :)
4
Great place to take visitors to to show off with the great view. Really liked the beer and the food, even though putting cocktail cherries on my duck confit was a bit irritating.
5
This is a craft brewery on the 33rd floor of the Marina Bay Financial Centre (the one with the Standard Chartered Bank logo on it).The brewing on premises using those beautiful copper kettles is what attracted me to LeVeL33 - and the few pints I sampled certainly didn't disappoint. But I'm also delighted to report that I had an exceptionally tasty wagyu burger delivered with efficient and friendly service - which I enjoyed eating and washing down with a nice pilsner whilst admiring the wonderful view.All in all - a magic lunch
4
LeVel33 as its name implies is on the 33rd floor at Marina Bay Financial Centre, Tower 1.This is a unique restaurant which has its own brewery. The proprietors are Australian and the food is international and simple but very well presented.The starters and salads are self serve as are the sweets but the main course served at the table.We were taken there by a friend from one on the businesses in the area. and can highly recommend this restaurant. The views are fantastic.
4
be warned SGD$50 for two beer and a cocktail is pretty hefty price, however, the view is sensational and the bar oozes a sophisticated charm that makes it all worth while.Beverages - I sampled two local brews, both were great, and my wife tucked in to a mojito. Drinks were very good. The view was betterAtmosphere - cool, charming, contemporary, overlooking Marina bay. its pretty awesome actually and I would go back againTips - i think you may need to reserve outdoor seating or you will not get a spot with a view.Best: View & Local Brew BeerWorst: Prices is steep, but not majorly problematicGo Again: For Sur
5
Had a lovely meal for my fiance's birthday. The website doesn't do the place justice. It's much cosier, and less business like than the website implies. Also, it's not obvious on the website that you can eat food outside, but you can. Lovely warm balcony with view of the lightshow at the Marina Bay Sands
2
How can this not be successful, sitting on top of the Financial centre with stunning views over the bay? The food's good and I understand the beer is too. So why should they bother about service when they're going to make a fortune anyway? Booking is haphazard, staff are abrupt and inefficient. They got the booking wrong twice. Service was an odd mixture of the too fast and the too slow. I was still half way through my main course when my companion's plate was whisked away and he was asked if he'd like a dessert. He opted to wait for me thankfully. If you order white wine, they pour the entire bottle into your glass as quickly as possible (letting it get warm) then ask you if you'd like another one. Service is sometimes too brisk sometimes unprofessional - some of the girls are vacant and clueless, others are snippy and unpleasant. But as I said, why should they care - they're obviously raking it in
5
Found our way here - what a fantastic surprise - their beers are great. I had the pale ale and we shared a selection of small plates - mmmm pork belly to die for. Good menu selection and food was delicious - view magnificent! A great night out! It was Friday, but lucky to get a table late ... imagine a popular spot for after work drink
4
I would recommend this place if you would like to chill out with a few friends at somewhere quiet and nice. I have been there a couple of times so far - enjoyed having our mini group of girls' talk overlooking Marina Bay Sands, sipping away a pint of house beer. No comments on food as I usually go for drinks. Prices of drinks are pretty standard, and I really enjoy the space and quietness, away from crowds and noise. Some staff are not very friendly - but I think I could live with that. There are no bands, and typically nothing much going on in the bar/restaurant. it's really just a quiet moment up at level 33. :
5
The handcrafted beer of this microbrewery (highest urban microbrewery in the world) is delicious and the food is great too. It is rather pricey but the stunning view on the entire Singapore Marina makes way up for it. Reservations are highly recommended!!
3
It's epic. The foods good, service brisk, views exceptional. Bill stratospheric.
1
Was delighted to go here and try out their Saturday lunch. We loved the ambience and the food. Cut the case, I decided to give them low rate since the service was really really poor. When we came, there's no one at the front door. Asked manager for onion rings as side dish (they don't have onion rings, but served it in one of the menu) and he said that couldn't do it without even ask the chef. Given dessert menu, and we put it aside, already think what to order. Manager came and just took the menu without even asking!!! I'm very very disappointed with their poor service. The place looks half empty yet they can not deliver good service!!! Too bad that even the food was good, it was spoiled by one people's act and destroy our expectation about the place
4
I got a chance to visit LeVel 33 in April 33. My Singaporean friend highly recommended this place and we decided to give it a try. I've heard the place is great and the view is one of the selling point. It turned out I was not ready to find the truth. The view is not great, It is AMAZING and SPECTACULAR.The place is SUPERB, nice ambience and cozy. Very relaxing. The waiters are so professional.The food is not as great as the view in my opinion. The one thing I remembered is the butter they served. They have three kind of butter and they are great.I highly recommend this place if you want to hang out after office hour. Reservation is highly recommended
4
Getting there by public transport: follow signs from Raffles Place MRT to Exit J; after you enter the long walkway passing by the sign that says One Raffles Quay on the right, follow the signs to Marina Bay Financial Centre Tower 1. There is a dedicated elevator to bring you to the restaurant from Tower 1's lobby.The view is fantastic; you are not too high up and no other place that I know of in Singapore gives you a city view from that angle where all the landmarks around the bay can all be taken into a photo. Their house brew is also very special, and drinks are reasonably priced especially during happy hours. Way more worth your money than the original Singapore sling.According to my friends who have made repeated visits, food is a little hit-or-miss. I found my roast beef fantastic but some of them said that they have had better at the same place, and it really depends on which part of the beef they give you - I had a good cut while my friend's was kind of dry and tough. Service wasn't good, which is a general problem in Singapore - we have learnt to ignore that.Nevertheless still a great place for an evening chill-out - or for tourists, for a memorable lunch or dinner in Singapore
4
I would definitely recommend this bar/restaurant for tourists and singaporeans alike. I have been to many other sky bars in Singapore but this tops them all. Instead of peering down onto roofs of other buildings this gives you a great angle and looks out onto the bay at marina bay. The city looks fantastic from this bar and it is the highest brewery in the world! It is obviously expensive being in that great location so recommended only for one or two drinks
2
Oh wow where do I begin. I was excited to be in Singapore and have the time to visit level 33. Boy was I disappointed! I am a beer snob and proud to admit it, I brew my own beer and am a craft beer junkie. The "craft" beer sold here is anything but a craft beer. All it is is another BMC micro brew touting their beer as craft beer. This stuff is garbage and not far from an MGD 64. If tjis is the best Singapore has to offer they are a long way away! Now don't get me wrong, if you like a good view, drive a BMW and have no idea what a good craft beer tastes like this place is for you. Spectacular view and a very nice decor. Unfortunately I was there for the beer and it fell flat
3
We reserved a table for 9 but when we got there(on time) the table was for 6 and there weren't enough chairs.... it had rained earlier in the day and being on the terrace some of the seats were wet, and they could not be wiped down as they were cushions. Logistics were eventually sorted out although it took some badgering of the manager. : - (Given the prices they charge the expectation is for at least some efficiency on this front.Would like to commend the wait staff who subsequently were quick with taking orders and delivery of the orders.... and suggest the management consider more 'practical' seats given the weather in Singapor
3
Superb view, yes, but otherwise disappointing. We sat outdoors after a typical Singapore rainstorm, the seats were damp and we got the odd drip from the roof landing on our heads. The food was no more than average. Nicely presented but my fish was overcooked and friends' dishes were nothing special. I realise its selling point is the microbrewery beers but was surprised at the lack of choice in wines - not everyone wants to drink beer with dinner. Staff were hard-pressed when it became busy and needed some prompting for example to provide more than one menu for a table of 8 people!It was all a bit pretentious for my liking - a place to be seen amongst aspiring socialites - and with pretentious prices to match. I don't think we'll be back anytime soon
4
Location is yet another one of Singapores up and coming elevated dining room. We were told we could not book a table and eat outside - when we arrived it was obvious that we could (I hate indoor air conditioned freezing eating rooms!) we were put on a waiting list which is probably not really existing but a nice way to be told no. Next time we would insist on booking an outdoor table!The menu is good and varied. The food was good albeit for my dish I felt like it had been standing around a while, whilst my husbands was piping hot! The service is good not great but it depended very much on the individual - we had to tell a waitress that our food (which we could see - both cold starters)was ready it had been standing 5 mins within a moment it was on out table with apologies. Another waitress was really effieicient and professional with drinks so varied. Atmosphere is really nice and relaxed - I enjoyed the place. Will I be back - yes but in a while there is too much choice in Singapore for me to go rushing back tomorrow....
5
Loved the menu, and very reasonable prices. The salad and dessert bar was a really nice touch, and very well laid out. View over the marina was great.
5
With a fabulous view over Marina Bay, drinks and canapés on the terrace is the best way to tend the day. Slick, efficient service and great quality food makes this worth a visit.
5
Excellent food in a fantastic environment. Friendly staff made the night even better.
Its hard not to be impressed by the views from the balcony.
I'll be heading there again soon and I'm looking forward to it!

I always go back to this place again n again when I have visitors. I love it n they love it. Always lucky to get a table outside just ask the staff to block one once other guests have left the table. The view from there is much better than looking from marina bay sand. It has micro brewery n want to recommend blond lager. Food is good but normally we go there for drink

For the last few months, I've felt like I can’t read a magazine, newspaper or website without hearing about LeVeL33. So this place definitely has a buzz in the local Singapore dining scene. The views are, of course really spectacular. Better than dining at Ku De Ta, because at LeVeL33 the entire wall is glass, with no obstructions from curtains, plants etc… Request a window table!And the desserts were all very impressive and memorable. I would definitely return and just order dessert! And the interior is very nice and very now… dark wood, masculine and strong.Some gripes though… after ordering our meals for five people the server returned 5min later and informed us two of the meals were not available. The one and only mocktail on the menu was served with different ingredients than listed. The duck was so severely undercooked it had to be returned, which meant the other four meals were consumed before the duck was re-served. Admittedly… the food was pretty good, but these are some pretty serious holes in the service and overall offering.In summary, definitely a place I would recommend for the view and the vibe. But they need to tweak the setbacks, before I would call this place a real winner

This is a great place to visit for a fabulous view of Marina Bay. We got here at around 11pm when staff advised us that the kitchen was closed, however after quickly speaking to one of the waiters they managed to let us order a round of canapes. Everyone who served us was amazing and you could tell that they really like their jobs. We also ordered gin and tonic and the gin came in little bottles of Hendricks which was very cute.Quite pricy but definitely worth it

This is a place to visit friend after work or plan a visit with friends who are working in the financial district. If you can reserve a table with a view on the deck it can be romantic. Being in the financial district and a room with a view, this place is pricey.This is a brewery with a restaurant. The micro brews are tasty and attract the upscale financiers of the area for lunch and after work drinks. Reservations are highly recommended even on week nights.The food is tasty. From fish to pork belly the menu is designed to eat with the micro brews on tap. There is a wine selection and dessert bar. The all the meat ordered seemed slow cooked and falling off the bone or melting were heard several times over the table. The sauces were heavy but the dishes were not drowned in the sauce. The veggies were fresh and not overcooked.The service was good at first and very attentive but started to lack towards the end of the service. Possibly the manager had run to the back doing the totals for the night. The location is busy. The location is a big bonus for the clientele to bring their friends into a view of the Marina Bay. It is nice to see the skyline of Singapore towards the Marina Bay Sands

We spent an evening with friends there, reached around 7 pm. The views of Singapore before and after lights are very different. Friends totally enjoyed. They have a micro brewery on site and a decent wine collection. The good was gourmet style and their pork roast is a must try

This place may just be a current fad - everywhere in Singapore suddenly becomes "in fashion" at some point - but it has more going for it than many other places. The view is of course fantastic. You can sit there and count the ships offshore, through the mist, assuming you don't fall asleep doing so. The product of the microbrewery is certainly worth trying. The blonde was as good as any. The stout was excellent. We also had some snacks and sat and watched the time pass. Not cheap. Mainly Philipinna staff. Certainly worth a visit.Nearest car park seems to be across the road at Marina Bay. Awkward if it is raining.Just in passing, I wonder how one gets in or out of the restaurant if that single elevator is out of order

One Sunday afternoon in February this year, my brother Tony introduced us to this boutique restaurant with the most amazing view of Marina Bay. A dear aunt & uncle had come for a visit from Toronto & since their last visit was 20 years ago, Tony decided LeVel33 combined both his idea of a place for good beers & a great way to see the dramatic changes to Singapore's skyline in recent years.While waiting for the main course, we could take our drinks & walk along an outside covered balcony to take in an impressive view of the entire Bay as well as the spanking-new resort-casino of Marina Bay Sands The inhouse micro-brewed beers were pricier than normal but certainly had character. Food however, was ordinary & limited in choice. Nevertheless, the steak was served in hearty portions, so my recommendation is to consider skipping breakfast & doing it as brunch on a weekend

Food was not too bad, just ate some bar snacks. I was more interested in the beers which are craft brewed on premise. I really enjoyed the porterhouse beer.
4
Yes, the beers are expensive, but the view over the Singapore Marina is superb. If you get there early for happy hour the beers are more reasonable, and you're more likely to get a seat with a great view. Serves a good Sunday roast too!

I visited this restaurant with a colleague. We wanted to have our dinner somewhere with a nice view. Not only did we get that. We were received VERY well by a young lady which apologised for there not being any tables available when we arrived. But she took us to the bar where we had refreshments. 20 minutes later, when a table was available, she came back to us. As promised. I am not surprised. What she promised with her capacity and awareness the place delivered. Both food and beer (stout) was excellent. The same can be said for the view.A last tip. The elevator has the button on the outside and NOT on the inside. Had us standing in the elevator like two idiots for 3 minutes until we understood that it was not at all moving. Nice elevator though..

Atmosphere is cool. The beer is great. Tried the Back & Belly. Back was a little fatty, but the belly was out of this world! I would bypass the fries next time....too hard in the middle. All in all a really good place. Will return for sure

A restaurant, brasserie, microbrewery on the 33 floor of the Financial Centre Tower 1.Beer is obviously their speciality here. We had the blonde and it was good. We shared a seafood platter - with prawns, smoked fish, salmon, squid, sauces, heidi bread, salts. For me , I think i would have liked the ploughman's platter better but it was fine. This was plenty to share. But then we had the cod and I had the duck duet which was very good and cooked well - the meat fell off the bone.Our bill for 2 came to 148 Singapore dollars with 7% tax and 10% service charge.The service varied from over attentive to un-attentive at the beginning and end but for the most part it was good.The view and atmosphere are good. I would recommend this place if you have a friend in town or what to have a nice quieter night out in the financial / Marina Bay district. Lots of people there straight from work.Order a taxi early before you head down and wait. A very busy area that doesnt get a lot of taxis naturally

Experience was great before but after last night were not what we expected. Service was bad and thought of bringing my friends to enjoy the experience. Somehow limited menu and staffs seems to slack off. Drinks still worth the price I would say but would love to experience different flavors. However the food consider so so and worst not much choice to choose from. Is it the chef slacking off too. Well no idea. I hope I still be back again after last night

Given the multiple of bars with views of the Marina Bay area, I think this place takes the cake.I have only been here for drinks. which boasts of one of the best views in the city. Beers are good. The best is to go at about 6pm, so you can catch dusk and get rewarded with the nightview after sunset.Love going on sunday evenings as it is less busy and you can always snag a seat outdoor

Went there on the last day of Dec 2011 for new year celebration with colleagues at lunch time. Totally disappointed. I have to say the scenery is nice, but not about the food. The waitress ordered wrongly as we have total 13 pax, maybe she's new... :

LeVel 33 is a good work bar with a reasonable selection of real ales to keep the ex-pats happy and an unmatched view across the bar for tourists to marvel at.It gets extremely busy on a Friday night as office workers from Raffles Place and MBFC make their way to the pub, and is a popular place to take clients with many professional firms.If you are up for a rowdy night, 33 is a good option but I wouldn't recommend for food beyond the bar snack menu from which the beef tereyaki is excellent.The dining menu is very expensive for what is really gastro-pub fayre and being located in the same room as the bar, seperated by a single step, is very noisy at the wrong time of day.The exec lunch menu is pretty good value for a set lunch but don't expect anything out of the ordinary

The view of the marina bayfront from the restaurant is spectacular, especially at the outdoor area. However, the food, while decent, is as spectacularly overpriced. Craft-brewed beer is pretty good and not exorbitant at all ($13 for a pint at happy hour till 8pm)Service left much to be desired, considering how expensive the place was. We asked to doggybag a substantial portion of pork roast, but were told they had no boxes or plastic bags. The staff grudgingly wrapped the pork in aluminum foil and artfully twisted it into a mini handbag-shaped package for us to take back. So we walked out of level 33 toting the latest must-have shabby chic accessory of the year. Come on! I spent more than $300 and the restaurant couldn't provide a box or carrier or plastic bag?

Was there with 25 of my colleagues. We did all get a good and professional service. It was a very good experience. There home made beer, was perfect to the menu. The view was fantastic.

Food was terrible, service miserable. As a microbrewery the beer was mediocre at best. It has a great view - just go grab a table outside and have a drink, enjoy it - then leave.

I appreciate the service of a filipina lady rischel!she make our night fantastic!At first ,we just walk in and did not reserve table.She approach us and told us that she will put us on a waiting list and will make her best to give us the best sit for outdoor.I beg her because it is our anniversary and I want to have a fantastic night with my wife..And after a while she made it!!with a great service and smile!! Great JOB!!!You can ask them to make a surprise cacao fondant with some greetings like I love U!happy anniversary!etc! Thanks Guys

Visited LeVel33 at lunch time for a tipple after wandering round Marina Bay.We tried all four beers on offer. All o.k. But nothing to shout about. The view on the other hand is outstanding and worth the price of the beer. We did not waste time with food, but it seemed popular with diners

After hearing good review of restaurant, I went with my colleagues for weekday lunch. 33SGD executive lunch is their standard offering. Open air veranda is also available for seating. I would use this for entertaining clients, guest. Also seem to be good for somewhere you go for dates, special occasion

Great views of Singapore, especially at night with the lightshow from Marina Bay Sands. Spectacular views.We have been there for dinner/lunch and drinks. The food is good but nothing special. Stick with pasta, salad or simple meat. However I do think the lunch menu has a good price/quality. You can start at the small buffet for antipasti and salads en bread. The you pick one of the dishes from the menu as a main - either fish, veggie, pasta or burgers and you finish with some cheese. fresh fruit and or cakes from the dessert buffet.For dessert during dinner I tested the Tarte Tatin with 3 different fruits - looked lovely but was rather soggy .No recommendation for that dish Dining is only inside and the balcony area is for drinks only

My colleagues and I travel a lot, and have an interest in discovering "rooftop" bars and restaurants with fantastic views and atmosphere. LeVel33 in the Marina Bay Financial Centre has just gone onto our list. We were transiting through Singapore and read a good review in the Singapore Time Out, so thought we would give it a try. My friends arrived by taxi (easy), and I took the MRT to Marina Bay and then looked for the MBFC exit - which was more difficult to navigate than I expected, and a good 10 minute walk underground. The entrance to the restaurant is from a dedicated elevator from the ground floor of the MBFC Plaza.I have to say we only went there to drink, and weren't disapppointed. We didn't eat - although saw a lot of people that were eating and seemed pretty happy with the service. Our drinks waiter was a Scottish expat local who was very friendly and chatty. The restaurant is large inside, with huge microbrewery beer fermentation tanks (unusal given this is on the 33rd floor of the building), but the jewel in the crown is definitely the balcony tables - looking out across Marina Bay toward the Marina Bay Sands Hotel and the Theatre precinct. The views were stunning, and I found the beer very drinkable. Expensive, but that was to be expected in a 33rd floor balcony restaurant with billion dollar views

If you go, sit outside on the patio. The view (obviously) is beyond words. Very lovely atmosphere. The food portions were a bit small and our scallops were slightly overcooked. Also ordered the bread and dipping spreads and it was a little tough for my taste. To be fair we only ordered appetizers and no mains.The beer was great until you get the bill. I think that is the case with everywhere in Singapore though ;

We r a bunch of 8 friends who wanted to have dinner n drinks at level 33 restaurant n bar. Despite calling 2 days in advance we were told the place was fully booked for the next evenings. We were told to go early as "walk in" customers before 6 pm to get a table. We went there before 6 pm n were told by the counter girls that the place was fully booked n only standing space at the bar was available. There was even a fancy computer screen showing us the restaurant seating plans to prove it was full. We left out contact numbers on the "waiting list" so they could call us if seats were to be available. Later in the night at about 8 pm we went up again n were told the same story. Finally we went up again at 11 pm n we were again told the same thing., that the place was full. 2 guys from our group decided to just walk in to take a look n we found MANY empty tables !! There were so many available seats! We then looked around n saw mainly Caucasian n foreign customers. We came to the conclusion that the staff were turning us away at the door, deceiving us that the place was full, either because they did not welcome us (singaporeans ) or they did not want more business / work for themselves. The drinks were good n view fantastic but the service quality left us a bad aftertaste

I went with a group of friends on Saturday night. Level 33 is a craft-brewery restaurant and lounge. This restaurant give you a full view of Marina bay, you can have a good glance of Singapore night view. Beer is ok, the food is not fantastic for the price we paid. The service is poor, the waiter who serve our table sound rude he really spoilt our night... but the waitress are relatively friendly....I guess the only thing that will make me come back here is the awesome view and nothing more than that.....
