It is not a great culinary experience to eat here, but it's fun, convenient and cheap.
The juice 'joint' in the middle offers nice drinks ... but considering the glass is half filled with ice, it's very expensive.

Good choice of south east asian food is available here - Chinese, Japanese, Korean , Indonesian , Thai. You may not find Indian or Western food stalls. Seating is ample.

Visited the Food Junction food court at Bugis for a bowl of congee at lunch today. Easy enough to get a table and it was reasonably clean. Congee came with shredded chicken and wasn't too bad either.

Hungry and don't want flour? The grill chicken wings is my top choice. 6 whole wings for 9$ was quite cheap.
The Skin was perfectly crispy and meat inside was so juicy and well marinade.

My husband treated me to this above place for dinner when we went back in early Nov to Singapore to clear the flat. There were a lot of dining options available. My husband choose the Korean tepanyaki while I chose the yong dou fu.I got to pick from a variety of vegetables and meats, and also the type of noodles- thick or thin. I would say that there were far too many tables the day that we went and so they closed a portion of it. Luckily, we still got to find a table quickly

This food court, like most food courts in Singapore, suffers from table-titis - lack of cleaned, clear tables. This constant hassle deters would-be diners to zoom in here.Especially during the peak period. Otherwise, this is quite a good dining option.We ventured in for dinner at 8pm but could not find a vacant table. We went shopping and was only able to eat at 9pm

A more European approach to hawker style eating. Suits everyone in particular those from Europe a bit squeamish about the very excellent Maxwell food court. We tried a do it yourself soup with a little stove and as much veg as you could load onto a plate. Prices a bout double of Maxwells at 8 or 9 dollars. There is no need to spend 40 dollars at your hotel to eat mediocre when you can come here.

This hawker style food court in on the third level of Raffles City easily accessible by the MRT station at City Hall. It was relatively busy at lunchtime mid week when we visited but this didn't present difficulties in finding seats or finding food. There is a wide selection of local and regional food styles. Freshly cooked while you wait and watch adds to the experience. The prices are reasonable and the quality was good. Certainly worth dropping into if you are in Raffles City and are feeling peckish

You can find all the great food in here, so convenient! Clean and easy place try singapore flavour. I personally like the Chicken rice on right hand side from entrance or the amazing egg noodle with barbecue pork on the left. The singapore's style breakfast "toast box" open around 7.30 am which give you a wake-up coffee with some toast and eggs
