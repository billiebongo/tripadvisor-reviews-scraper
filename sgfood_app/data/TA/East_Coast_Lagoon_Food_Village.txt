Great, like many of them actually are. Lots of choices, and undercover as well. Unfortunately a bit out of the way though.
4
Someone at the hotel I was staying at recommended this to get a feeling for where the locals eat and she was exactly right. This place was affordable with friendly service.
4
A good place for seafood and satay. Try the stingray in spicy sauce. BBQ beef, Fried rice top. Good choice of drinks too. Nice place to spend an evening with friends.
5
We just had an excellent evening at the village. There are probably 100 hawker stalls to choose from. a real authentic place.
4
Came here for several years already and honestly not all the shops are so great but they are few they really make the difference. my favourite are the DUCK RICE stand 29 if I dont get wrong... as u enter just on your left hand side second shop and the sting ray shop on the right side. Very delicious and everlasting taste. would love to rate the place individually but seems is not registered or possible but so 4* are my general feedback
5
Succulent satay and crunchy rojak..where you ask..East Coast Lagoon Food Village of course..With rows of stalls selling says, you will be spoilt for choice..For me, my choice is clear..It's gotta be Haron's Satay..The meat is grilled just right, peanut sauce not too oily but very crunchy..The Chinese rojak is yummy as well..With only two stalls, you can try both and decide for yourself..Of course being a food village there are lots of seafood and other dishes on offer..So do yourself a favour, give the place a go..You won't regret it.
5
Plenty of choice here with plenty of locals lining up for their favourite dishes. The satay sticks were sensational! It is a great location and after dinner you can go for a stroll along the parklands there. You need to pick a table and remember the number and then go to any stall, order the food or beers and they will deliver it to you table. It can get crowded on a Friday night but we had no problem getting a table. A great choice to try some genuine local food

Easy accessable, ample parking, tremendous choice of food, seafood, chicken rice, sateh, its all there and very reasonable priced, cleaning of tables when they become available is fast and good, very popular seven days a week, but specially on the Singapore Family day; Sunday.Popuar with locals, as easy to reach via two ECP underpasses and by town folks as well.Highly recommended by a frequent visitor
5
This Foodcourt is one of my top list to have dinner with friends & families. It's not so easy to get there by public transport and only one bus line operating from Aljunied or Bedok MRT system.You can have black pepper crab which is my favorite ever and prefer than chili crab version,BBQ chicken wing,Teo Chew style steam fish,BBQ stingray or prawn,Rojak,oyster omelette,Sambal kangkong,La La or Chuk Chuk, Ohh mouthwatering isn't it ?

I must confess that I’m a fan-club of Satay and every time I have the chance to visit Singapore, satay will be my sought out food. So the only place serving the best satay apart from the Lau Pa Sat, would be Haron Satay at the East Coast Lagoon Food Village. Haron Satay stall no.55, is located adjacent to the main entrance of the food village and the whole stretch of hawkers in that end area sells satay only, however, Haron’s stall would be the one that stands out as there will be a long queue making their orders. What so special of Haron’s satay? The satay is grilled to perfection and the meat is fresh, tender and juicy. Haron Satay’s are generally skewed generously with meat fillers mainly beef, chicken or mutton. I personally fancy the beef, crispy on the outside, tender in the inside and it’s not too oily. It taste mildly sweet but not burned. Grilled to perfection. Each satay stick costs around S$0.60 each with minimum orders of 10. All satay platter is served with homemade peanut gravy, ketupat(steamed glutinous rice), slices of cucumbers and onions. “Yummy and mind blowing food tasting.”Apart from satay, Haron’s stall also offers BBQ chicken wings. Moderate taste but practical for side orders. For drinks, Haron’s next door sells sugarcane juice. Great combination if it’s served icy cold while you tuck in your satays’.And of course there are a variety of food around the food village if your food exploration doesn’t end at Haron’s.To get there, there is public bus such as bus line 401 traveling along East Coast, and drop off at bus stop B93151 and another 5 minutes short walk. Or else for convenience, get a Grab or Uber service. Expect a big crowd over the weekend evenings as getting a seat can be a daunting experience

When with friends to East Coast Lagoon Food Village.We order 10pc Chicken & 10pc mutton.Self collect waiting time about 25min.Chicken was BBQ just juicy and tasty .Mutton was a little disappointed out of 10pc .....4 pc was full of Vein .....Attached photo.
4
A good food outlet. So many places offering all Asian dishes
You just pick a table, pick what you fancy and it's brought to your table
Same with drink
Cheap and authentic dishes
A good night out

Very good hokkien prawn mee. Not too soggy and taste just right. With a tasty noodles with windy beach what's more can you ask for?

I am a visitor from Malaysia and this is the first time that we are eating at the East Coast Lagoon Food Village.It's well set-up with very attentive food vendors. You can find all sort of food variety there. Not necessary the tastiest, but they are not that bad. Some of the items are highly prizes - an example is a buttered prawn is S$8 per prawn...that's just way too expensive.It's next to the beach. So, you can buy food and head to the beach to eat. There's a good walking path to walk around.Lot of locals eat here. So, that shows that it's a good place to eat. Taxi is not easy to find...it's juts that you might have to wait a bit longer than usual.It's a good experience & I would come here again for a meal
5
I visited the food village with some friends who live nearby- they often eat there and after my whistle stop visit to Singapore you can see why!It's a buzz with delicious smells, friendly Hawkers, colourful atmosphere and excellent food (so much to choose from!!!)Pick a table and off you go around the dozens of Hawkers choosing delicious fresh cooked food! So quick is the service you end up with a table loaded with food! Adimann Seafood and Satay Specialist was my favourite Highly recommend this cultural eating village - a real taste of Singapore!Love Satay love Singapore Eat drink and enjoy!!Trev
4
great place for seafood and ambience is fantastic. too bad that the place is always busy in evening but good thing is that there is a growing space and churn is not that bad either for u to get a seat in an hour max. (yes, an hour sometimes but hey, u can relax next to beach)
4
If you want to try 'local food', this is the place to come to. You can get almost all the different types of food, Chinese, Indian and Malay and the prices are reasonable.Beer is also available and the beach is just a minutes walk away.It gets crowded on the weekends and sometimes getting a seat may be difficult.Its definitely worth the trip if you're in Singapor
5
we had seen this gentelman making the charcaol chicken wings in tv, and made it a mission to find him.we did, the chicken wings are to die from they are just awesome, had to get more, so glad we found it, keep it up SIR, thank you :) :
4
An Enjoyable place to eat for our favourite local dish and seafood by the sea side. An open space and sheltered area with the aroma of barbequed Stingray! This place was ever since my childhood with my family. It brings so much joy and happy reunion here! Whether is in a day or night, never failed to come here all over again to crave their most popular Meaty Satays, Otahs, Barbequed Stingray, Sambal Cockles, Fresh Coconut juice, Fresh Sugar Cane and much more! For non locals, should try this place! For locals, I know you guys would come here over and over agai
5
I live a 10 minute walk from this place and come 3 to 4 nights a week. The place is amazing friendly with an enormous selection of local dishes at very reasonable prices. My tip come early and get a table beach side where you catch the breeze. Enjoy
5
Abundance of food to experience and a nice setting. Try to get a table nearby the water. We go there almost once a week.
4
A good variety of food is found there just by the seaside. Easily accessible by car or taxi. However, the place can be quite crowded on weekends.
4
We went to the East Coast Lagoon Village on the last night is Singapore and wished we had found it earlier. It mainly seafood but the variety and choice is good. Satay is also available. We went for a walk on the nearby jetty to lose the added kilo's
5
This is the place where many locals Go to eat good food. The whole area is filled with many small food courts and they got a little bit of everything. Try the Chicken Sate, supergood, really worth the effort to get here. It is located 10-15 min with Uber from CBD. Very Cheap
4
Super relaxing place to be.. A lot of seafood, from Halal to non Halal, Pack with Tourist, A lot of Seating area,. Best place to seat was the one with shelter area in the middle of the hawker. with fans. Its best to get seats with fans on top of u as the place sells a lot of spicy Asian and seafood. Superb food. I had satays , lots of them, their gravy is nice and the chicken , beef satay, superb tasty and soft. we also had cockles with sambal and even fried rice and few more dishes. prices are not bad. but beware of places where really mark up price. Its a good place to have a family gathering
4
We were staying fairly nearby in Katong and hopped a cab ($10 at rush hour) and got here in about 15 minutes. Our goal was satay and we found a good Chinese stall. (My wife prefers pork satay, so we couldn't go to Malay stalls, and they far outnumber Chinese satay stalls.) The pork was cooked perfectly. The sauce was good, but our favorite satay at Chomp Chomp has a pineapple flavor that was missing here. It was good, and the pineapple would have made it great. At a different stall, we got chicken wings and they were very good. At still another stall, we got an oyster omelet. The omelet was done quite well, without being overly oily.Everything was very good. I wouldn't rate any of the stalls as being best in Singapore, but all were good. On top of the food, the view of the ships anchored just off the coast makes this an enjoyable place for a post-sunset meal
4
Quite often visit the East Coast lagoon food village by bike as it is within the East Coast park. Also accessible by road there is a big car park next to it.The location is peaceful, the front of the village is almost on the beach and you can see the sea through the trees. There are lots of shady seats and there are even some outdoor pavilions there that have seats and ceiling fans to cool you down.The satay is a good option here. Lots of different stalls to pick from, all good and in my opinion as good if not better than satay by the Bay.There are good juice and beer shops here for refreshment. We have also tried other things like Kang king with sambal, BBQ seafood like stingray and cockles, Oyster omelette etc.The place has a good local crowd and gets really busy at night. Would recommend checking this place out if you are visiting Singapore. Good fun, hawker dining by the sea
5
An outdoor food court of sort where one can pick and choose whatâ€™s tempting to the palate: fresh fruit juices, satay, grilled shrimps, and many other delicacies mirroring the multiple ethnicities populating the island. The dishes are freshly prepared and beautifully seasoned. The favoured booths have long line-ups
5
Eaten here probably ten times. Done lunch, dinner, alone, with friends, proper visits and biking right in. This is the best hawker centre I have seen. The variety is immense, from satay to sambal stingray (a favourite). The setting is pleasant, covered in case of rain. You get a beach nearby and Singapore Wake Park, if you feel energetic afterwards. Finding a table may take time in the evening, but it is a price worth paying
5
We have visited a couple times before, but recently went for lunch for the first time. There are less stalls open and the atmosphere is less vibrant, but the experience is still excellent. There is a large variety of local foods and drinks, and superb value for money. Try everything as it is all good! Very popular with locals which indicates high quality of food
4
Visited this place for dinner on a Sunday. The fried oysters was really good! From $4-$10 per plate and thus great value for money. It's right beside the BBQ chicken wings stall but be prepared to queue for a long time.
4
Best sate at Oleh Oleh and great seafood at Ocean Muslim Seafood. Great friendly service. Fast and efficient. Not expensive.
The sate is fresh with great peanut sauce.
4
Tons of choices to choose from, there's always something for someone. What's best is the location, right on the beach, just adds to the fun outdoor eating experience.
5
I was brought here by locals, and I can see why! So many stalls with real local food. Anyone wanting to check out local food, or hawker stalls, this is your place! So many foods to eat!
5
Me and one of my colleague had lunch at this place while killing 6 hours flight connection. This is nothing short from an adventure. We tried the famous pepper crab, deep fried spicy fish and bans with chilli sauce. While that was one of the messiest lunch I ever had, it was also one of the testier I had. The crab was cook perfectly and the fish was full of flavours. The chilli sauce is a start dish. All in all, expensive but worth the experience.
4
Down by the waters edge and we were the only European people there amongst hundreds of locals but there was a great atmosphere. Numerous food outlets to choose from with all styles of Singaporean food, order what you want, find a table and let them know the table number and it will delivered to you in minutes. Compared to the Newton Circus Hawker Centre this venue was not as efficient in clearing or cleaning the tables, however it was very busy
4
A hard-to-beat delightful experience to be able to eat almost under the clear blue sky, open spaces, with the cool sea breeze all around and the seaside just next to the eating areas. There's unbelievable choices of the local, hawker foods and the most popular orders are the fresh seafoods of squid, lobsters, stingray fish, being barbecued or deep-fried to delicious crunchiness ! Another really good eat, will be an order of satay of beef, chicken or mutton...satay is the local version of marinated, barbecued meats on sticks, which comes with the side of spicy peanut sauce, to die for. The local yellow noodles of mee rebus (malay style noodles topped with flavourful bean sauce), mee-siam (vermicelli cooked malay style with a nutty cococut gravy), mee-goreng (yellow noodles stir-fried with pieces of shrimps, fish cakes & beansprouts) are just a few eats favourited by the local Muslims. Not to be missed is the local and all-time favourite salad of Rojak. A favourite non-halal dish will be the excellent black and white fried carrot cake, roasted chicken rice, or dry mee-pok (flat yellow noodles served with mixed sauces,slices of fish cake, and fish balls). I wish to mention a favourite soothing sugar cane drink which can be ordered with lots of ice-cubes or without. The freshly squeezed sugar cane without ice-cubes cost $2.50 per tall glass, and of course there's also all the cokes, pepsis and beers that one can have there. The never-ending choices of local, hawker foods, much cheaper that restaurants and taste just as good, or even better. A lovely place to chill-out with family and friends. There's a large car-park and there is also eating spaces which has covered roofs and decent size tables and benches. No fear if there's a sudden thundery rain shower. The best time to visit this fun eating place is probably during the weekdays towards the evenings. It gets rather crowded during long weekends, public holidays and evenings on Fridays and Saturdays. Nevertheless, it is THE place to be when you absolutely need to eat local, see local or laugh local....see you there ! Just one more mention.....this is NOT as restaurant but a local, outdoor eating place with a large number of mix of stalls offering a variety of choices of local foods

We had dinner this evening (Thursday). What a great place! We arrived about 6pm and went for a lovely long walk up to Bedok Jetty and beyond. Then we were lucky to find a table with a sea view - which meant we had a nice cool breeze. I think this gets very busy later on in the evening and at the weekends. Perfect. Cold beer. Absolutely delicious BBQ stingray and fried squid at 01-43 Stingray Forever BBQ Seafood. Beautifully presented and really nice service. Recommended. We had the best satay we've had in the month we've been here in Singapore (and we've had a lot of satay!) at stall 55 Haron Satay. We then had some excellent fried black and white carrot cake which we'd never eaten before from a stall very close to No 43- Stall 40 Lagoon Carrot Cake. This is a really enjoyable evening out in good weather. We took a taxi there and back. I think there are buses that take you quite close by.
5
The seafoods at Seasides BBQ Seafood ( Stall no 3&4) is the best seafood that I have tried in Singapore. And its have a very wide variety of seafoods and other foods to choose from with reasonable prices. Besides BBQ Seafoods, you can also try many other different types of food there. Thumbs Ups 
5
Let's face it, if you are a street food lover, you can't miss east coast lagoon food village. This is essentially a food court, covering huge area near the area F of ECP. Plenty of food variety, from Satay and chicken wings to staples such as chicken rice and mee goreng . We usually order Satay as starters and end with sea food fried rice. And yes, suger cane juice is must have. Prices are quite reasonable and comparable to the food court elsewher
5
Great place with family and/or friends for sate, barbecued fish and seafood, carrot cake and lots of other food, fresh fruit and fruit drinks in a very informal, great atmosphere close to the sea
4
This is the only hawker food centre along East Coast Park. Great selection of food. Walk around and check out the places with locals queuing is usually a good indication.
In general, you will get nice food with cheap price here.
4
Came here for early dinner. This is a great place for local hawker fare. It has a lot of stalls selling seafood too. This will be a cheaper option vs those restaurants. It is located close to carpark F1.
4
The ECLFV is one of the better hawker centers in Singapore, perhaps even the best one, in my humble opinion. Part of it is the location by the beach, which gives it an airy quality that the downtown centers lack plus a great view, and part of it is the killer satay you can get in the evenings.The selection is for the most part standard, but also fairly varied. This isn't a huge center, but all the essentials are there. Once again though, when the satay grills fire up at night, that's when things really get interesting.The only real drawback to the ECLFV is its popularity, which means it can be very challenging to find a seat. Look clueless enough, and a vendor will assist you in hopes that you'll order from them. Also, if your food is at least somewhat portable, you can always wander to one of the nearby BBQ pits by the beach and watch the huge ships form a skyline of their own. Just be sure not to make a mess, the locals are kinda strict about such things.Go during the day for a more laid back experience and sample the many booths, and then come back later at night to grab a whole bunch of satay. Singaporeans enjoy going out and eating even at late hours, and the atmosphere is very lively and pleasant.If you're walking here from the other side of the ECP, you'll have to navigate the bridge, some stairs, a tunnel and a path, but pursue your food dreams! It is a safe area (like Singapore is in general), and you'll find your way easily enough
2
The staff are wearing striking orange T-shirts - it did the job well in attracting the unwary ....And that's where the striking feelings end. The Satay is one of the worse that I have ever tasted.Service was excellent ... well its self service and each customer is given an RF token after each order. The RFP token lights up when your order is ready.Again that's where the interesting feature of the Satay stall ends .... There are many stalls selling Satay but I don't come here often enough to give a recommendation ..
5
The East Coast Lagoon Food Court is the best food court in Singapore! It is quite challenging to go there with public transportation but it is really worth the travel! You have a huge variety of seafood and any other food that you're used to in food courts. The taste is really good and the view is stunning
4
East Coast Food Lagoon is usually my first stop in Singapore when arriving in Changi Airport. It is a great spot to get a variety of food all in one single place. My go to will always Ah Hwee BBQ Chicken and Song Kee Fried Oyster, which happens to be next to each other.The facility is clean and if you go during sunset, you have a nice view of the beach! Its too bad that some stalls are not open during the day. If you go during off hours via taxi, you may have a hard time finding a taxi on the way back home. As a tourist, I almost got stuck there because I had no phone service to get an Uber. Luckily one wandered around. All in all, great hawker food stalls. Clean, convenient and yummy food.Oh, just a tad dark
3
Went cycling today along East Coast Park and then out to Changi Village and stopped off here on the way back for a fresh coconut. Most of the stalls were closed at 9am but the drinks stall was open and with a plentiful supply of coconuts. Just what is needed after a long bike ride
4
This is a great hawker food market! Lots of great food choices! We only had a few days in Singapore so this was a must! Located near the water it is nicely situated. Enjoy a walk along the coast then head here for dinner when it starts to cool.So much choice! The chicken wings & satays are a must. Good with a group so some mind the table while others line up for food! Lots of tables but can be a bit difficult to grab one! Just keep an eye out for a family/group finishing then pounce when they leave
5
One of the prettier hawker centres in Singapore, next to the beach in the middle of the park. Usual choice - everything you've ever wanted, and good quality. Facilities are pretty good as well, there are clean toilets which is all you need. Only downside is that it doesn't open all that early, so don't go for an early lunch as we did because there aren't too many stalls open when the centre opens up at 11.30. Best to have a taxi app if you want to leave as well, we didn't have any issues but it's a bit out of the way so plan ahead
4
Great food choices and very reasonable! Plenty of tables available, although this place is very busy from6pm (especially on weekends) of all the Hawker markets in Singapore, this is our favourite!
4
Lovely place to get some great seafood and hang with the locals, had a great time here thanks to the courteous staff hats off
4
If you want to stroll a little along the coast and try some street food then suggest the East Coast Lagoon Food Village which is close to the airport. We tried the satay at Haron Satay that costs SGD 0.70 per satay and they offer chicken, beef, mutton and tripe. At Choon Hiang we ate the Fried Kway Teow for SGD 3.50 and the carrot cake with shrimp for SGD 5.00 at the Lagoon Carrot Cake hawker stall (#40). Despite opting for the spicy version of the carrot cake it required some additional chili paste to give it the necessary kick. Suggest washing it all down with some of the Logan, Lychee or other fruit drinks -- opt for the version with crushed ice to cool you down. There are also plenty of seafood dishes, Indian food and bbq'd chicken wings available. The food court doesn't have AC so it gets hot and suggest going after 7pm when it cools down a little. As the place is a bit away from the downtown area highly suggest either arranging transport back or leaving not too late so you get one of the taxis that drive by. Note that most of the dishes are pretty reasonably priced but your taxi fare from the downtown area around Orchard Street will set you back around SGD 12-16 each way.
4
I wanted the satay bee hoon and came here around 9:30 pm. The car park is packed and full. The eating crowd is still there, it was only after some walking around before we found a table. The night is not that hot and eating out is pleasant. By the way, this is a hawker centre style but many tourists and local love to eat here. We also have our regular sugar can juice with ice. Waited in queue for the famous fried oyster with egg. Satisfying supper after a Long week away from home.
4
If you go to East Coast Lagoon Food Village, look up Satay Haron. Its really nice, for me nicer than most that I have tasted back home in Kuala Lumpur and almost equivalent to that in Lau Pah Sat area. However this Food Village is packed with patrons at dinner time even when we arrived as early as 6.30pm. Another attraction here is that this place is just walking distance to the beach area, but not the most ideal place to catch a beautiful sunset. Once you are done with dinner, Uber services are abundant so not an issue getting back to your accomodation
4
As is said in Singapore, cheap and good!Best thing is you can order something you don't know, and if you don't like, it's cheap so just try another!My favourites are from the Bak Kut Teh stall, ask for a lean pigs trotter with rice and preserved veggie. Sounds bad but tastes fantastic. If you just want a snack try the popiah and also get dark carrot cake at the same stall. Great but be prepared for the garlic after burn from the popiah!For the less adventurous chicken wings are always a good bet. There are many satay stalls but soo many other delights if you take the chance
4
We have been here so many times and I just love this place with itÂ´s great food, lovely atmosphere and oh so nice breeze. Take a walk in East Coast Park and sit down to have something refreshing to drink and a bite to eat or go here for lunch or dinner; try the satay, the seafood noodles, chicken rice, fried vegetables, the chilli crab etc. And try to get a table close to the beach where you can really feel the breeze. It can be hard to find a table around 7pm, especially during the weekends, you might have to wait/walk around a bit but it is worth the wait
5
It was super crowded although we got there close to 9pm.Lots of gawker fare so you canchoose between Indian,Chinese and Malay food.We decided to opt for seafood..squid done two ways one with sambal blachan and the other just sauteed with probably butter,stingray done with sambal blachan,two stie fried vegetables and a platter of pepoer crabs ,fried rice done with seafood.It is a lot of chilli do not for the faint hearted but dince it was a big hungry group of us(8 of us) we managed to eat almost all of it!!Ohhhhh..and we slso had chicken and mutton satays!!Super yummy with a side of peanut sauce!We had a fresh made lemon juice and fresh coconuts are delivered to you if you choose to go really local!It a lovely place to walk around after coz the beach is literally right there!(It is hot and dultry though so make sure you are absolutely comfy when you get there)
5
Went there one evening and was delighted with the place. This is eating with the locals on a grand scale. The place was set up long ago for poorer people to afford to eat. These local stalls cook your food while you wait. Some have wireless buzzers so you can sit at you table and go back when ready. Its pretty much cheap and cheerful with tables everywhere and just pick one. The food sellers cook traditional asian food of everything from seafood to meat to sweets. There are also drinks sellers with beer to smoothies and the usual canned drinks. All stalls are inspected by the health inspectors regularly and if below par are closed down. If you are fed up paying inflated prices in the places in the heart of the city, come here and pay $3 SGD for the same dish that cost $31 SGD. Ask a taxi driver and he will know where to go.
5
Hawker food of all kinds can be found here for lovers of Singaporean food. Prices are reasonable, quality is good and generally very clean. Enjoy the lovely sea-breeze as you tuck into satays, chilli crabs, various seafood, etc. I recommend getting a table close to the beach and have someone sit at the table while you wander around the stalls to make your food selection. Do take note of your table number!.
4
Love this place ... But finding a place to sit could be a challenge. Prices reasonable but cheap like in Malaysia.
Lots of variety!
4
Friendly auntie and good rojak! Sambal stingray and kailan is also excellent! Worth the visit to come on weekdays but not on weekends. Cannot find seats...
4
I love the Zuo Ji duck rice, the sauce is fantastic, and duck meat is de-boned, highly recommended. The stall originates from Hougang 3 mile many years ago.
5
Our favourites here are the chicken wings, clams, hokkien mee and satay. So delicious and best satay around, plus the great atmosphere at night with the sea breeze. Great place to take your overseas guests if they want to try a bit of everything.
5
Had a very nice dinner seated at the edge of the sand, with cool sea breezes, tucked into some sugarcane juice, BBQ chicken and BBQ wings, beef noodles, fried hokkien mee, oyster omelette and satay. Took a stroll to the beach at night. Wonderful sea breezes and the twinkling lights of the ships far away made it a night to remember 
5
Highly recommended from this particular stall Haron for e Satays and BBQ Honey Chicken Wings. It is the only stall that is pay first and self-collect. The young lady who took my order is quite friendly however, when picking up the food, you will face a very angry older lady and a very reluctant attitude young boy over the counter. I actually went stall by stall to check out their quality before decided to try this stall. They stand out among the stalls too with their brigh orange t-shirt uniform. The price is slightly higher I would pay if the food is really good and its peanut sauce is thick and served hot
5
I suggest for a westerner to bring a local with them to make life easier, but the food was amazing! Half the price of a place like Jumbo in the city, which means you can try a lot more! Chilli and Pepper crab, stingray, chicken, mussels, sugar cane drink, everything was nice and fresh
5
I live a 10 minute walk from the Food Village and have done for many years. Locals already know what's on offer but if you are visiting please make the effort and come out here. You will find an extremely friendly multi cultural mass of people just out to enjoy each other's company and great food. Sit out near Jackys Beer Garden (closest to the beach) and indulg
4
It's hard not to indulge at this place. We tried food from three different stalls. The must-have Chilli Crab was the most frustrating of all to eat, but the satisfaction compensated for the messiness of extracting the crab meat. The grilled jumbo garlic prawns were delicious, as were the beans. We also had beef and chicken satays and finished it off with black pepper crab and some lemon chicken. Yes, it was the usual suspects, but there's a reason they are so popular! Pity that beer is so expensive, but it's a captive audience..
4
Eating by the sea has always been my favourite dining place. Especially eating seafood and local delights. Eating a nice sambal stingray by the beach oh how my mouth waters while writing this. Its almost incredible as the seafood is super fresh. And eating it with the chicken/beef/lamb satay oh just lovely. There are plenty of delicious local and western cuisines that are scattered in this hawker centre.
5
If you are looking for an authentic Singapore Laksa... this is the best place in town. freshly made with lovely fishcake and prawn and spicy if you want
4
After a long walk that is a very welcoming stop for food. Quality us good and a huge mix of stalls even prata us back. Just a little pricy for hawker food.
5
Its good to visit n spent time here.Its near the beach where u can spent time swimming,football beach or volleyball beach,building sand castle(there is equipment where you can rent for sand castle)or you can just rilex at the beach.Futhermore you can enjoy ice cream with cheap price here.Other than that you also can rent bycycle n cycling around park just beside the food court.There are many choice of foods n drinks sold here,just name it and u will get it.Its nice at night where u can just rilex and enjoy your food n drink with the beach view and wind.It can be a sweet moment with couple
3
You have your usual array of street food here. Look out for where the queue is and that would give you an indication of the quality of the food.It is all outside so it is not suitable during inclement weather.All the stalls are reasonably clean and you can assess the level of hygiene as they have to display a sign from their inspection

Absolutely missed the olden days feel.The Malay and Indian food stalls are better comparatively. Less touting and stares when you are not buying as compared to long time ago.But the Chinese food stalls mostly are not up to standard with bad services and over pricing.Place is over crowded with screaming kids and tourists/diners crowding around your table, waiting to take your table once you nudge.Parking is horrendous with cars crowding around to snatch a spot when there is a chance. We waited for about an hour for a spot, but were lucky to get one before we decided to switch venue.All these just during our last visit, not to mention the few before the last. Maybe we were getting sentimental because it is a place we went to dine since our childhood, and we kept telling ourselves to give it one last shot. But I think this will be the last...Will never return to the area unnecessarily.If there was any good in it, the Beef Kway Teow at Leng Kee is still as good as before. But it's tucked in one corner and you really have to look for it.The satay stalls are friendly but beef will be overcooked and harden like rock after a short while when it gets cool down. The rest are ok

Filling up with beer and food before a great walk on the East Coast. Just had the best ever chicken wings that I ever had. Also had a vegetable and seafood pot - absolutely gorgeous and at very affordable prices. And I can't complain either about the cold tiger bee

I was dying to try chilli crab and black pepper crab so was advised to go here. Went with 4 colleagues and while we did order a lot of food, $300 for a hawkers market is expensive. And the food quality was pretty average. At least I no longer have a desire to taste chilli crab or black pepper crab.I had black pepper prawns in Port Douglas, Australia that were far better. When I told a taxi driver about it, he said that this is a tourist rip-off, We are far better off going to Chinatown hawkers market for value

Took a while to find the place "48 Roxy Laksa" mentioned in several foodie blogs, so just look for the "East Coast Lagoon Food Village" instead (otherwise GPS lead you to a wrong place and you have to walk for 30 min at least). But the laksa was very good. Small portions are $4.50, large portions are $5.50. We opted for large portions. Each had 3 shrimps, which was fewer than we expected from previous foodie blogs pictures of this place, but nevertheless it was really tasty! Roxy Laksa has grade "A" for hygiene. They provide both the reusable and single-use bowls and utensils (cook gave us single-use ones without asking:). They put some spicy sauce on the spoon, but if you need more (like I did), you can just go back and ask for more.
5
Don't come if you don't look for local food. I love that place. Great local food at reasonable price. The place can be crowded and you may wait to find a table but that's really worth it. East Coast Hawker Center is a must try in Singapore. You can find several hawker center in Singapore but be very careful with the price. Always ask for the price before ordering.

Bringing family to each coast beach on CNY holidays, after a long walk stop for foods. We order seafoods at stall Ocean Seafoods, the food OMG!! Especially the IKAN PARI BAKAR super yummy and spicy and their BABY KAILAN with Oyster sauce super delicious. And also not forget the SATAY from ADIMAN i guess so the name of the stall were also nice both my parents loved it so much
4
you can find good food here, seafood, satays, bbq chickens. but it's kinda difficult to get seats as it's always full. i love to go on weekend and have early dinner then you can walk along the beach after that.
4
ECFV has a different vibe from most of the hawker centers in SG. It seems less crowded together and more patron-friendly.Seafood seems to be a specialty at over half the shops. Also worthwhile, ar the stands selling freshly squeezed juices. I really enjoyed the watermelon on a typically warm SG day
4
East Coast Lagoon Food Village provides local food at a reasonable price. Great place for friends and family to gather around and enjoy a family meal together. You can get a iced cold beer during a hot sunny day. After jogging, cycling or exercising, it's a good stop to refuel the carbo lost. Hope you enjoy your experience at this food village.
5
Even at 12am, there'll be flashing neon lights in front of the food stalls clamouring for your attention, the smoky fragrance of barbecued chicken wings and satays wafting through the air, and the background buzz of conversations punctuated by an occasional bout of cheering or laughter.You'll be spoilt for choice at the many stalls and options. Every few steps or so, stall owners would wave their menus in front of you and enthusiastically introduce their chef's recommendations. Ah Hwee's BBQ Chicken Wings: Loved the crispness of the skin and the juicy tenderness of the wings! Drizzle some lime over and dip them in their special chilli for that taste bud orgasm.Yang Chow Fried Rice: Perfectly separated rice with generous portions of seafood ingredients. :)BBQ Sambal Stingray: That is a plate of pure sizzling goodness. The intense sambal complemented the succulent stingray perfectly and MYGOSH. It's heavenly.Oyster Omelette: Eating this dish is like digging for gems on a treasure hunt, with hits every once in a while. That exaltation comes when you finally manage to capture the elusive oyster bits by prodding with your chopsticks. It was slightly too dry for my liking but the chilli redeemed it slightly. Not the best Hao Jian I've had though. Most of the dishes were bought from the stall that Chow Yun Fat ate at (honestly I couldn't quite remember the name of the stall).Satay: Loved the slightly charred meat chunks with their succulent interiors and the thick peanut gravy

I always come to this stall to have my seafood dinner that is reasonably priced. Owner nickname call "angmoh" means red hair, and his team would help to find table to sit near his stall. Must try!!! 1) lala(shellfish) beehoon 2) stirred fried spinach with ikan bilis (dried anchovies), 3) steamed crabs, 4) seafood prawn roll, 5) deep fried smelt fish or can go for Teochew steamed promfret
5
When we go travel, we always want to visit where the local eat! Our friend brought us to this place and it was amazing! $100 SGD got us 4 very full with seafood, shellfishes, satay, dessert, drinks, & stingray!?!The food village is also beside the lagoon, beautiful when it wasnt dark and when the sun set, you can try the food there. Very affordable and worth going.
5
I live in USA but have been traveling to Singapore for over 20 years. This is my "go to" place in Singapore.The open format near the sea makes it very relaxing. Leng Heng makes some of the nicest, consistant, Singapore food available. Not only my opinion, but my local friends feel the same.Get there early to get close table.Barbecue Sting Ray is fabulous!Chili Crab is as good as it gets.There are also many good options at the this seafood centre but I always go back to Leng Heng
5
The food here is fresh, and there's just SO much variety! Make sure you grab a table before you start browsing the stalls. It can get very crowded on weekends. You cannot miss this if you're a foodie. Crabs, prawns, satay, stingray.. the list goes on.
5
Tourists...You have to make your way over here. East Coast park is itself amazing. Miles of park and small beaches. You can rent bikes etc everywhere here and just enjoy your day, but one of the highlights is definitely this food centre. Offering tons of seafood, fresh fish, satay etc, with a view of the water and all at really reasonable prices (Think $10sgd you will be full, $20 you will be stuffed and get a drink too!). The satay here is special as it is cooked over charcoal, unlike those in town where burning over coals is avoided due to pollution. The Hong Kong Roast guy is excellent and always has a long queue. The rest is a fish/seafood lover's haven.

We arrived here after a long busride around noon, and with our experience with other hawker centers in the city, we thought we'd be late to the party, but no, not many stalls open yet, feeling a bit empty, but there was a line at the duck rice stall (which curiously had no price info) and we ended up with some excellent duck meat on rice, and at another stall I got oyster fried noodles. One of the oysters tasted very funny, but my tummy did not catch anything bad. Great place / cheap eats when you explore ECP
4
A lots of choices for local foods. The price for seafoods is about the same compared to Newton Hawker Centre.
4
Lots of choice seafood, crab, satay, drinks, desserts,
A typical food court right on the beach.
Of course it is more expensive that others you can find downtown but still the best deal around.
4
cheap and great place to enjoy local food
we three ordered bbq crab. shell bbq. vegetable. chicken satte. oysters and some local pudding. so nice taste and good place until midnight.
5
The place is living like a city. You can find any kind of food that is specific for Singapore- satays, seafood, poultry, everything freshly grilled and tasty. Must be there in Singapore

East Coast Lagoon Food Village is one of the best hawker centres in Singapore in my belief. As a resident in Singapore, if you've eaten at this hawker centre, then you've eaten at them all. East Coast Lagoon Food Village has a totally different ambiance from many other hawker centres in Singapore, its outside and is located right next to the beach on East Coast Park. This makes it a great venue to relax at and eat after a day of biking or walking in the park. It is also a fun night-time destination for people looking to get out of the CBD. East Coast Lagoon Food Village is a wonderful place to eat chili crab, pepper crab, satay, and BBQ stingray. Eating here is fantastic experience, and I love the casual, family-friendly feel of the establishment. Bring big group friends and secure a table before you adventure out to order from different stalls. Don't worry if it looks busy and there are no tables available, the turnover is usually pretty quick. The only drawback its location, it is a bit difficult to get to if you don't have a car. Best to get here by car, taxi or bus #401.
4
Head down to the East Coast Lagoon for a feast after a nice swim or cycle by the beach. Located next to the cable ski park, the Food Village is not a Restaurant but a collection of countless stores to select food from. From the famous Satay to the exotic Pig Trotters cooked in Black Sauce, do approach any local for a recommendation and they will be more that happy to introduce you to the myriad of Singaporean Food
5
My overseas visitors loved this place! It's by the beach and offers all the cheap local hawker dishes. The bbq chicken wings, sambal stingray, satay with mee rebus and lots of other local delights is a good place to introduce foreigners. A short walk by the beach after all the food is also a must afterwards
4
Forget Newtons, this is the place to go if you want a hawker centre to tickle your tastebuds. This is where the locals go, so when in Rome do what the Romans do. An amazing choice of food, all freshly cooked. A great eating experience, and amazing value for money. Try something different and you won't be dissapointed
4
I ate, and ate, and ate! Is that a good summary?Tons of variety. Problem is your dazzled eyes can't focus after a few food stalls! Prices are much higher than in Malaysia, but go for it! They will not break your bank!Partake, it's safe to eat. Be adventourous (emphasis on the word TOUR)
4
we visited here with friends whilst in Singapore and found it very good,clean,reasonable and the food varied and local.Fresh seafood ,tiger prawns and satays in abundance with seating in a food court setting.Well served by locals and not touristy like Newton Circus.Highly recommended for a local experience that does not fund the national deb
3
Nothing too special about this place with all the usual food you would expect in a Singapore hawker centre. Convenient place to stop for a drink on a day of cycling. Prices are slightly higher than at the hawker centre in Changi Village.
5
Definitely worth visiting - go with a local if you can. be prepared to leave with a full stomach so save yourself. eveníngs are better because its less humid and cooler
4
it is greatest place if You would like to try Singaporean cusine - street food. Place contains of dozens of small local bars - some of them prepares only one or two dish. It is at the beach so You can eat outside (the only option) and admire sunset. It is a kind of place where only local people go and although it has a lot of seatings it is not easy to hunt the table - yes You have to hunt it. There is huge variety of different food: meat, fish, asiatic cusine so You can try really half of Asia there. Place is cheap but of course not ideal for first date. Rather to meet friends or discover local street food
5
Living on the East Coast I go here regularly and I have never been disappointed. OK it's a hawker centre and as such sells typical local food. The food is always good, prices are good (maybe a little higher than some of the other hawker centres) and the atmosphere is great. Its always buzzing early evening
4
Ordered take away from Haron Satay before, and found out that we only received 40 sticks of the 50 sticks of satay we had ordered. However, since we did not stay close to this food centre, we did not drive back to claim the missing 10 sticks of satay.Today, we decided to drive and get to the food centre early (6pm), and eat at the food centre. We ordered from Haron Satay at 6:10pm, and waited till 6:40pm to get our order of 30 sticks of satay, and we did get all our ordered sticks of satay this time around

where should I start - upon an advice from a local who happen to be on a seating next to me on my flight to Singapore from BKKas he boasted - try the red chili crabs at Eas Coast Lagoon Food Village - they are to die for – hence I decided to check this place outgetting there is not easy unless you have a car (to own a car requires 70 Grand upfront just for the license in this world’s most expensive city mind you haha....)after getting off at Bedok MRT (subway) station 30 mins later from downtown we learned that there is no bus or trains go this placeyou had to wait for a taxi for an hour in front of a mallonce we finally got there this place was like a zoothousands of people - as if they were handing out free foodwhich they certainly were not (more on price later)there were many many food booths to choose fromwe settled on one boldly advertising the red chili crab and ordered italong with stir fry vegetables and chicken sataysnow the problem was finding fining an empty tableevery single one was taken - after loitering for about 10 mins we found one on the very age of this village few mins walk from the stalland when I went back to let them know the table number – the dude at the stall asked if I really wanted the foodwhat the *bleep!!!it had taken me two hours to get this far, time was 9 o clock and I was very hungry by nowI said yes indeed quite irkedThen went looking for drink since this stall didn’t’ sell it After loitering from another 5 mins I found the stall selling beer and got a beer for $17 for two carlsbergsfinally took a journey back to by table holding beer and two glasses and waited for the food to arrivered chilly crab came in in 10 mins or so and it was not even average tastingstir-fry green came almost 45 mins later when we were about to leave and was simply inediblechicken satay is what they try to imitate the Thai version – below par all in all we spent $70 - for couple of beers, a crab at $35 and the rest not sure what the draw is for all them people to flock there - expensive, bad tasting food and yet takes an epic journey to get there and scramble for food like refugee in campnever in my life I had to work this hard to get such a bad food for such an exorbitant price and left and left with utter displeasureAJPs the dude who gave me advice and everyone in Singapore including taxi drivers are one of the friendliest and charming people I have ever met in my journey. The bas review is just for this place and the way its operate

We’ve eaten here a lot, and have almost always found the food excellent in quality and flavour. With all hawker centres and similar, remember each stall is a separate business. If you get poor food from one, this does not mean all are bad. The number of local people who use this place clearly shows they find most sellers offer great food.Prices are towards the high end for a food court, and that’s not surprising. You’re paying for the location. It’s a great chance to sit near the sea, enjoy great food, a splendid view, and the refreshingly cool air coming off the water.Toilets are clean, and stylish. However, when busy in the evening, the ladies toilet in particular struggles to cope with the demand, and at that time both toilets can be untidy with litter. We prefer having lunch here, it's quieter and less problems with smoke from Satay vendors.Very few tourists find this area, and really it’s more suitable for ex-pats and residents. If you are in this area, and want reasonably priced yet good food, it’s unbeatabl

Before I go into the review for this place here's a very handy tip about any Hawker centre in Singapore. If you are going to eat at any hawker stand always make sure to take either paper napkins, or packaged wipes or even packaged moistened wipes beforehand as the Hawker stands do not provide any of these with their food. It's a little thing but better to be clean than sticky for next few hours.This food village is well worth the visit as the food stalls offer some of the best and varied meals in town and at a reasonable price although perhaps a little more expensive than others but not by much. This is not to say every thing on offer will be to your liking so look for what you are familiar with as some of the food can be out there. Tables are numbered and you will need to know this number before ordering so food vendors can bring your orders directly to you. Leave a package of tissues or a paper napkin on the table as this indicates a reserved table and is respected as such. Getting there by taxi is not difficult but getting back by taxi can be so be prepared to order a cab when done. even if you don't eat the atmosphere is a lot of fun
1
They claim to be the 3rd generation of a family passed down recipe but I guess the taste has diluted by generations.Not worth the rave! wasted calories! Terrible frown on my face, never gonna eat this again. Mercure Roxy hotel has better laksa at their buffet.
3
After they are renovated, finding a place to eat is a lot more easier.
Recommended food to try is always the satay bee hoon, fried oyster, duck rice or noodle and many more.
5
We often go here for dinner. Our favorites are its seafood, juices, and chicken wings. From which stall? Any! Doesn't really differ anyway :)

went to a friend’s house for a marathon evening of 2 wimbledon semis – Federer vs Raonic & Djokovic vs Dimitrov aka baby Fed. we took the pleasant stroll to east coast lagoon food village. the last we came was during roland garros on 8.6.2014. this time we tried the supposed famous pig trotters at han jia bakuteh & pork leg. i wanted bakchormee so i skipped the rice & just had the trotters. according to my friend, this stall was quite good except that it was less good in the evening as the trotters got to be too soft.my bakchormee was ok but not of the standard of tai wah bakchormee, jalan tua kong lau lim at bedok simpang, jalan tua kong meepok tar at 6th avenue etc.my 2 other friends ordered also taupok, chai buay + peanuts & kidney, liver soup. all were ok except the pig trotters. partly because we ordered the lean trotters, but this was way below the standard of any good trotters stall like ng ah sio bakuteh, song fa bakuteh etc.i had tried several stalls here after 4 visits including laksa, orh luah, satay, beef noodles, bbq chicken & now the pig trotters. except for the bbq chicken wings & orh luah which were good, i have to say that this food centre is way below par c/w with say maxwell road hawker centre, amoy street hawker centre, hong lim hawker centre & bukit timah food centre. http://chefquak.com/2014/07/06/pre-wimbledon-semiworld-cup-france-germany-dinnereast-coast-lagoon-food-village-on-4jul2014

First thing is to get a table as all tables could filled up, so you need to be quick to react to occupy as soon as someone leaves, food is excellent variety dishes from Malay to Chinese, sea foods are cheap and beers are plenty, must visit for Singapore
4
This hawker center is not as busy as some others as it's more frequented by locals rather than tourists. The food selection is very good and prices are not as high as some "tourist traps". There's a good selection of seafood and nice and clean facilities. You can also take a walk along the lagoon after eating to burn the calories off. I highly highly recommend Ah Hwee bbq Chicken stand. Get those wings you won't regret it
5
If you are looking for good food at reasonable price this is the place to go. The place has one if the best chilli crabs and other seafood dishes the only hassle is getting there as it's not hear an mrt. Taxi is the best optio
4
Came here after our meal at Jumbo because we wanted to try and fit in as much good quality Asian food as we can in the three days we had in Singapore. We walked around and ordered some clams, more sambal kanagkong, satay chicken and beef sticks and chicken wings. The clams and satay sticks were awesome but I preferred the sambal kangkong at Jumbo and the chicken wings were pretty average. We come here every time we come to Singapore (for holiday or a stopover) and it's great every time. Must go
4
Its location in East Coast Park, just steps away from the sea, its layout and the variety of the different dishes available make a great mix. A great place to meet up with friends or have a drink and snack after a bike ride or walk in the park. The relaxed, informal atmosphere make this a good place for families with smaller children, too. Very popular on the weekends which can make it difficult to find a table after 6.30PM especially if you are coming with a bigger group.
4
The first time we have been here and really enjoyed it. Clams, Satay, squid, Stingray wings, Chicken wings and more. Our friend had a Hokien Mee which he felt wasn't quite top notch, but otherwise it was all good. Food like this, on the beach with lashings of ice cold Tiger - my kind of evening! Hundreds of cargo ships anchored off the beach make a pretty sight. Only slight downer was the numerous dragon dance troupes - it was a bit full on and my ears will probably never quite recover, but hey it was CNY! We also went one lunch time, still good but not every stall open and it really is an evening place
4
After a relaxed day at the beach, we headed there for early dinner. If you don´t have a car, take MRT to Bedok and from there take a cab. The choice is amazing: all kinds of fish and mussels and crabs. What you really have to eat there is Chili crab, because that´s one of the most famous dishes in Singapore. Although it is quite expensive it´s well worth it. Best enjoyed with a beer or fresh coconut. We also had delicious mussels and fish cake baked in a banana leaf
5
Although we have many stall operators trying to get our attention, they sell almost the same type of food there. They were not pushy though, i would rate the place as a reasonable nice place to eat out in Singapore overall
4
Standard hawker food. Love their sambal stingray and kangkong. always order from different hawkers depending on where I sit. While some people have preferences, I think the stalls here have similar standards.
4
The food court offers a variety of food at good prices, an excellent alternative to the expensive restaurants in the area. It does get crowded at peak hours. the food is abundant.
4
Very relaxing and enjoyable meals at very affordable prices.Excellent BBQ stingray, mix vegetables, butter prawns.Beer is also really cheap.Must visit for a relaxing and refreshing experience of real SingaporeThe only thing which is a deterrant is the cleanliness of the area and the shortage of umbrellas when it rains
5
It was a tip from our home stay host: Most tourists tend to visit the seafood restaurants west of the lagoon, while the food village to the east of the lagoon sells the same food for a fraction of the price! Sellers are not too pushy, and the choices are almost too varied to cope - if that is possible. Enjoy

Since the first time we visited here, I always wanna come back again. Since it is located in east coast where is quite remote. It is accessible only by car/ taxi or by bike. No MRT nor bus is nearby...This time we did a bike trip, we ride bicycles along the east coast park and stopped by here for early dinner. It was even more impressive than the first time I visited here. Since last time we visited here after 8pm, it was completely dark that I couldn't check out the place clearly. This time the sun was still on and I could check out shop by shop clearly. Wow, soooo many shops, they seem different but very similar... it's quite headache to choose which shop to go for indeed... well, do not panic! Can choose few different shops to complete one meal and doesn't have to stick to one!According to my experience, few dishes I must try here: Chicken Wings in BBQ style, chili crab (last time I tried), stingray (just a try, small portion is enough), satay sticks (chicken, lamp, pork, beef etc, you can go for mix!), sugar cane drink or huge coconut drink!I think the the concept is nice here that you can visit few different shops to buy different kinds of cuisine for one meal! This is something definitely cannot do in a restaurant, but only in food centre!It is easier to find a table before 7pm, also less crowded. It is definitely relaxing facing the sea view, next to the beach with the breeze. It would be nice to visit here combine a bike trip along the east coast =) cheers 
5
This is the only Hawker place I chose for my visit to Singapore, and just took away other places from my list (Newton, Lau Pa Sat, Gluttons Bay).We went here on a Sunday evening (well.. 5pm local time actually)took a Taxi from Plaza Singapura since it rains a little (taxi cost S$10). We could take MRT to bedok and ride the 401 bus, but taxi is much faster.Arrived here and rain stopped.. thank god..the Place is a huge open space with tables at the center, and the stalls are circling around the tables.We did not waste any time, and go straight to one of the Stall recommended by locals:Leng Heng Seafood BBQ & Claypot Deluxe, the stall number is No. 6. After entering the main entrance, go left toward the beach.We ordered:1 Chili Crab with Mantou (S$40)1 Sambal Kangkung (i forgot, I think it's around S$6 ?)and ordered Lemon Chicken Rice (S$4 ) at the stall with the same name (Leng Heng Chicken Rice)got 10 skewers of Satay..then we feast! with an ocean view, eating seafood.. it was great.. Definitely the Crabs are affordable here than those Seafood Restaurants..to bad its raining again when we were almost finished, we cannot have an evening stroll by the beach...Would like to go here again and try the Black Pepper Crab.
4
It is a nice place to visit with a group of friends. Price for seafood here is slightly cheaper than outside. Variety of type for food make you feel excited. I truly enjoy the leisure environment here. It is not like a fancy air-conditioning place, however, the night breeze makes you feel so comfortable when sitting there. it is not reachable by MRT, only by bus + walk or by taxi... however, it is still worth visitin
5
What is the quickest way to get to the east coast lagoon food centre?I took the MRT on east west line got out at Bedok and walked. Too tricky to find way across expressway. Any other ideas?I loved the food. We were served in the morning when not many are open so got great service. Extra food and they cooked it to our liking, with less oil, not as spicy, and cooked the cockles well just in case our guts might not handle them..thank
5
I wanted to find the best chilli crab in Singapore, but at a budget.....After reading blogs on the net, I decided a trip to East Coast Lagoon Food Village. Mainly for its excellent location, with its beach and lagoon. I got there early evening to avoid queues and headed for Leng Heng BBQ Seafood. I choose my crab, my beer and enjoyed the best crab I have ever experienced. The spicy sauce had a peanut twist, served with deep fried buns to soak up the sauce.....I can't wait for my next trip, for the crab, beer and friendly owners
3
For Singaporean, I can only say we are spoiled with all the good food. So, this place might be good for tourist if you like to try something local in a restaurant.
4
Eating here can be hard work, hard to get a table, hard to wait in line for the favourite hawkers, hard to put up with the humidity and heat, but it's worth it. A bit more of a dining experience than the shopping centre food courts, with sights, tastes and smells to stimulate the senses. The food is typically better than most other fancy food courts and the satay is good. Prepare yourselves for a wait for a table, then go with the flow and enjoy
5
Get there early or wait half an hour or so for a table,its always packed the number of times I've been there, a contrast to the Newton Circus Food Center where you have loads of tourist and after work people, dressed up. Here you'll find the local Singaporeans whom you should know by now, loves to eat !! People are more relaxed, casually dressed, prices a little better than the other place I've reviewed. Mostly self service, remember your table number if its table service. I found a bit too humid there, not much wind that night, I guess. Try Satay!! One of the best Satay in Singapore is served here.Many, many stalls to choose from and they're all great!! Enjoy !
4
The place is located near the park and the beach unfortunately the beach is polluted but there are no bad smell. the food are very good! you've got to taste the food here when going to Singapore... after dining its very relaxing to walk beside the beach and in the park because it is very safe even if you stay late at night however only mcdonalds is open 24hours.It is also a good thing because of the healthy benefits of walking since you can digest your food while having a healthy chat with your companions. thanks and we hope to comebac
5
It isn't necessarilly the food - there's better elsewhere, or the cleanliness -- the place can get downright scuzzy on a weekend night. But there is something about sitting by the water having really decent food and ice cold Tiger beer. As an American, now living in Singapore, everyone talks about Newton CIrcle, but that's over-rated and too expensive. Almost every time I come back from Changi, I have the taxi stop and I "tah pau" a braised duck from one of the stands furthest from the beach. The bee hoon satay is also outstanding (stall near entrance from car park) but long long wait. Another good one is salted vegetable soup (stall near beach). And I LOVE the satay.
4
Sure, you could go to the fancy indoor seafood place up the road. You could even add such unnecessary items as cutlery and tablecloths to the experience. But at the end of the day all you really want is hot, tasty, chilli-filled mud crab oozing out the side of your mouth and down your chin. The tablecloth is a token attempt to keep your clothes clean, and it will never work anyway, so go get messy with the locals instead.As you grin stupidly to your equally unskilled tablemates in the war between your ravenous stomach and the hard-to-get-at filling of Mr Crab's claws, you'll possibly notice that the locals are rarely joining you in this art of eating that sees much more food being flicked across the table than into your mouth. That's because the locals are usually eating from the myriad other stalls offering everything from succulent satay to perfect pad-thai. You get the feeling that as much as they all love the mud crab, they're just too hungry to go through the ordeal of trying to get that little bit of meat from out between those 2 spiky bits of shell. Don't let this deter you though, as persistence pays off and you will no doubt get that one mouthful that delicately slides into your mouth, at which point you would probably yell "Eureka!" were it not for the distinct possibility that you would spit your lone mouthful across the table, away from your yearning stomach.Chilli mud crab from a hawker stall in Singapore is one of those must-do experiences. Grab a Tiger or 2 for the voyage, take your time, and make sure that you remind yourself that it's about the flavour, the experience, and flicking chilli onto your mate's clean shirt. Any satisfaction of hunger that comes with this is purely coincidental

I've no idea how this place compares with other hawker centres as we only went to one, but we really, really enjoyed it.Just bag a table (the locals apparently put a packet of tissues n it to bag it but we just left someone sat there), make a note of the number, get some beers in, choose a dish here, a dish there from the stalls around the outside, tell them your table number and sit back and wait for it to arrive. Some want paying when you order, some on delivery. Take some wet wipes with you because you end up with all sorts on your face and hands. Oh, and get there reasonably early as some of the stalls start to close up around 9. You won't be disappointed

Foods which are served at Makansutra is also served here, plus more other Seafoods.And the difference is the view and ambiance.At Makansutra, you'll get the Singapore-Signature view, while here, you'll get the Beach view and experience. :)Enjoy your favorite Chili Crab, Cereal Prawns, Spicy Chicken Wings and Satay in the Sea side. There are several Umbrella-Seats and Cottage-like dining to enjoy your food.You can rent a room by the beach to experience the "summer" outing. Or better yet, bring along your own tent and Camp at the Camping Areas. Just make sure you get a permit. You can also bring foods, grill and celebrate a special occasion while enjoying a swimming party. :)Sports like biking, running, jogging around the whole East Coast is also possible.So aside from the Food, the Beach experience is another factor.Thus, if you love to eat by the beach, this is the best place to visit. :

We love this place! Imagine hot night, cold beer, beach setting and your choice of a myriad of friendly competing food vendors, or hawkers, to tempt you with everything from satays ( a favorite) to fresh Asian prepared seafood, Malaysian, Indian and Chinese specialties...carrot cake (not cake and no carrots), popiah ( a kind of malaysian fresh roll), chicken or duck rice, and just about every other Singaporean popular food item. We have yet to be disappointed after several trips. Hardest is to keep trying new things instead of returning to ones we've tried and enjoyed. It can be a bit overwhelming if you arrive when it is busy, but it is pretty easy: you find a table, put down a pack of tissues to reserve it, note the table number then head off to select your food. Most vendors will deliver to the table. If beer is not your beverage of choice, the fruit guy makes great smoothies. And sells fresh fruit at ridiculously low prices that are a great way to end the meal. Then you are ready for a walk along the shoreline of East Coast Park. A great evening! Depending what you order and how much, can be quite inexpensive or not

If I could do it all again, I'd do it differently. Our Singapore stop-off on both ways to Australia included lots of eating out. I was most excited about heading over to East Coast Seafood because I remember it as a child. This time we took my toddler to Jumbo Seafood for Chilli Crab and Black Pepper Crab among others (and for the adults only, of course) - and it was lovely. Afterwards we took a stroll along the waterside up past the 360 degrees waterski/surf park and stumbled across the East Coast Lagoon Food Village.Boy was I disappointed! Disappointed that I didn't know about this place before we went to Jumbo! I would have left much more room for all the great food that is on offer here.This is real deal hawker food, proven by the fact that there were mostly locals here.It's noisy, smokey, steamy and full of lovely smells. It's all outdoor seating under trees.I ate as much as I could fit in before we had to take our toddler home. Next time we're in Singapore I'll definitely be back.A note though - make sure you arrange a car back from East Coast. So many people come to eat at the big restaurants the queue for taxis back are incredibly long - we waited for hours before sharing a van back, and at that point, our toddler was very upset. Don't make the same mistake we made! Arrange a car back to your hotel prior to heading out
