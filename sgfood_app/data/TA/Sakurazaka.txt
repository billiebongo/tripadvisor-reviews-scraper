Located on the community commercial area on Hillcrest. First time visit and found that this place serve good quality shabu-shabu. The shabu sauce was the major factor after fresh meats, vege and the base soup. Beef choices are all japanese beef, interesting for me. The restaurant atmoshere was cozy, sake was available in many brands. Good for many occasions

----------------------------OVERALL: HELL NO----------------------------Every now and then you come over a place you are trying to like for their food (which is mainly why you are there), but your overall experience including service, price point, environment etc is so bad, you end up giving a negative review. Which is exactly what happened here.----------------------------WHY I GAVE 1 STAR (even if the food was good)----------------------------So they have their Lunch Buffet Offer prominently displayed outside the restaurant (see photos), which simply shows a mountain of delicious beef and other shabu shabu items, plus the price 48++ SGD. Now that alone isn't the cheapest "lunch" option you will find around here (by far), but general good feedback from our friend's dinner experience and the particular promise of delicious beef, let us choose Sakurazaka over the next door VERY tempting 40++ SGD Japanese buffet, including Sashimi, drinks and dessert etc.Now back to our "Buffet". First thing we are told is that it actually doesn’t include beef… *silence*… WAIT WHAT? You show me a oompah loompah big sized mountain of your tenderloin on your sign outside and then it's not included in your buffet? Yes. It's 10 SGD extra… PER PLATE! At that point we looked at each other confused, pretty much realizing we should have gone for the other Japanese place next door.Anyways, it's supposed to be delicious so let's do it. Next up, we need to choose a broth for our Shabu Shabu, but behold… the beef broth is an extra 12 SGD… per bowl… At that point I was done. Everyone knows what really (easily) tips AngryAngMo over, are wrong promises, bad service, and mostly, if I get the feeling someone is trying to rip me off. And that's exactly how I started feeling here.Because the next thing I spotted was the little written "extra 4 SGD per scoop" that was next to the dessert option, meaning that was another miss and not included in the inflated 48++ SGD advertised.So let's recount, the "Buffet" doesn’t include any beef, doesn’t even include beef broth, nor does it come with the usual little desert, every other place is happy to serve. Well done, you earned your gold badge for false advertising.The food itself was good, and we ended up ordering 6 extra plates of beef because of it's quality, but they pulled the final trick and forever No-Go of any F&B place, when they charged us 5 SGD PER CUP of tea. Which would have not really been ok even if they had mentioned the price before, BUT, if you order buffet and your waiter comes at the beginning of the meal and casually asks if you want "Warm, water, cold tab water (both obviously free) and then throws in a "or some tea" (without ANY mention of ANY extra fee)…and then ends up charging you 5 bucks per tiny cup… then I have really no other option than giving you a 1 Star review, even if your food was good.Btw. we ended up paying 85 SGD per person (group of 4), up from an advertised 48 SGD. Without drinks or anything extra.----------------------------WHAT WE PAID----------------------------4x Base Buffet - 192 $4x Tea - 20 $6x Beef - 60 $4x 1 scoop of icecreme - 16$----------------------------288 $ ++ = 340 SGD = 85 SGD per person----------------------------FINAL THOUGHTS----------------------------In the age of social media, of hungrygowhere, tripadvisor, Instagram, twitter and reviews pretty much at every digital corner, why do this to yourself and your establishments. Look at your menu, look at your advertisement, and then ask yourself if this might end up looking really bad, even though your food is amazing. Don't spoil peoples anticipation by telling them of 10 extra charges and doubling their intial fee to the point where you don’t care about the actual meal anymore. Please, if your food is good, just price your "buffet" higher, or don't call it a buffet at all. AngryAngMo out

Visited the outlet before with some friends and sat at second table from entrance. I remembered was so hot then cos of the steamboat and the entrance I hoped that this time around I would get an inside table. But guess not although they were available like 5 tables inside were vacant but not cleaned at all. Talk about short of staff. Anyway we had the table for 2 this time next to the window. Was ok as the sliding door was behind us and wasn't too bad. We ordered two sets, beef and seafood sets. Was so so. Guess it would have been better if we upgraded the beef by adding either $18 or $25 for better Waygu beef. Otherwise the standard set was ok. The seafood was less tasty in my opinion.

Definitely one of the better shabu shabu places in spore.. their beef set menu is good value and u must upgrade to their F1 Wagyu beef or their Joshu Wagyu.If Budget is limited get their pork dishes @ $14/100g. Had the iberico neck and pork loin. Preferred the pork loin between the 2. Really good quality pork and it has that natural sweetnessIf there is 1 thing i feel that could be improved is their sauces. Don't get me wrong they have 3 delicious varieties of dipping sauces but for me whether i am eating at Gyu Ann @ Ginza Tokyo or Kobe beef @ Kobe Steakland the true way to enjoy high quality beef is with SHOYU and WASABI (hint hint). This place is a great find!!

Hubby brought me to this place for Shabu Shabu for my birthday. It's a classy place with romantic dim lighting. Suitable for couples but also quite suitable for families with children. We ordered 2 beef sets and upgraded one to the higher priced Joshu wagyu. Both types of beef were well-marbled but the Joshu definitely tasted better. It didn't have a "beefy" smell at all. The thin slices of beef were marvellous. I wish they included slightly more slices of beef and also had more vegetables. We also ordered the risotto at the end but it was ok only. Basically they added rice and egg to the leftover soup and then added mozzarella & cheddar cheese to it. We regretted adding cheese as that made the rice rather cloying and less traditional. Having that made us very full. Too full, in fact. After that they gave us our refreshing shaved ice. We ordered the matcha and Yuzu flavors. Both were special in their own ways. I really liked the Yuzu flavored jelly that came with the ice. I personally feel that if they have a spin-off shop selling these Japanese shaved ice, it might very well be a hit! Kudos to the Indian service staff who served us. I didn't get her name. She was very attentive and when she heard we were celebrating my birthday, she surprised us with a birthday apple tart from the French restaurant next door. She also informed us of a 10% discount if you are a Krisflyer member. Overall, we enjoyed our time at Sakurazaka and will probably return again when we want a romantic Shabu Shabu date.

I have been to this restaurant twice, once for a date night with my husband and another time with the children in tow. Both meals were on Saturday nights at 6pm. At that time, the restaurant is quite empty but it fills up nicely later in the night.The meal started with 2 slices of wagyu beef cooked on a hot stone and dipped in a sauce with an onsen egg in it. Delicious but gone all too quickly.We ordered the beef and pork sets for both meals, with the addition of some a la carte seafood dishes (e.g. prawns and scallops). The portions of beef and pork per set were generous, accompanied with a serving or rice/noodles and vegetables. We tried the beef consomme, pork and chicken stocks. Whilst we liked the pork and chicken stock, we felt that the beef consomme became very salty at the end of the meal, despite it being topped up a couple of times.I would highly recommend the Hokkaido milk for dessert. It was not too sweet and cloying, although I am not a dessert person, I finished the bowl every time.Service was very good, empty dishes were zipped away faster than I could say Geronimo and they constantly topped up our sake glasses. The staff were always nearby and attentive to our needs.Altogether a great place for couple or family time, the food is of good quality.... I will definitely be back

They were fully booked and we were lucky to get a reservation for 6 pm, when service starts.We were the first to enter and the entire dining experience was great from start to finish. The staff were very pleasant, yet efficient, and the meal proceeded at a good pace, without us feeling rushed even though they had mentioned that we needed to vacate the table by 8 pm for the next booking, In face, our meal only took 70 minutes.We ordered the wagyu beef and pork sets, for around $70 and $50 respectively. The starters were delicious - you have two small pieces of beef or pork that you grill on a hot stone, then dip into the sou vide egg - really wonderful. The shabu shabu came with three sauces - a sesame based which I liked the most, a yuzu one, and a lime based one for sewfood. The ingredients, incudling the meat, mushrooms and vegetables were very fresh, and you have the option of udon or egg noodles, or rice. For the broth, we went for beef and pork. Surprisingly, the beef broth was rather delicate, while the pork was robust. They also have aga dashi or seafood boullibiase, if you prefer those. We enjoyed the meat so much that we ordered an extra portion of wagyu sliced ribeye, for $25.The meal comes with dessert of Hokkaido milk with shaved ice, or mango topped ice. The mango was a little tart (perhaps there was some passionfruit too) but the provision of condensed milk helped to even out and even enhanced the taste. Green tea was $5 per customer, but they do provide refills. All in all, it was a great dining experience and we will certainly be back. It is located near to the Lana cakeshop and parking in the neighbourhood can be hard to find, so you might need to get there a little earlier

Read from the Internet on this Japanese shabu shabu. Excellent beef cut and services. The services are so good that even I turn my head they will thought of me calling them. Please call for reservation on the weekend before coming. Else they might still give you a table but a certain time you need to finish your food.
