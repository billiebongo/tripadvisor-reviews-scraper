1) Beef short ribs was very tender and the chocolate tart was good! Cod fish and tiramisu was average. 2) Restaurant was small and cosy. 3) Waitress attitude has much room for improvement
4
On the whole, the food was quite good. Ambience is also nice. Service was also quite good. For a weekday night, it was rather quiet.
5
Nice food... great service considering only having 3 waiters... props to them!
The discount voucher doesn’t apply to degustation but still very god value.

Came here for a Valentine’s Day dinner, whereby a set menu was prepared. Firstly the food was quite average, and for the price range it was served there are plenty of better options in singapore, such as No Menu, or Dolce Vita or Laterria MozarellaThe service was also quite poor where they would clear the plate of one person who had finished when the other people on the table were still eating. We tried to use our survival chic card, which they said was valid here, but then they argued they didn’t agree to it on the phone. Wine was the best part of the dinner, and that’s a shame for any restaurant. It was quite disappointing and would not come back or recommend to anyone.
5
Went there for a birthday celebration on a quiet weekday evening.As always, service was prompt and the sommelier is great for introducing an affordable bottle of Italian red that really goes well with the burrata cheese. Baby spinach salad is really flavourful and comes in decent portion. 48 hrs Stewed Short Ribs is well executed and Grilled Seabass was perfect too. Even the truffle fries is well fried with a good balance of the truffle oil.Strongly recommended if you want straightforward Italian cuisine that is simple and great.
3
It was son's birthday and we took him to Burlamacco for a family celebration. The waiter refused to take a family photo using my wife's phone, stating he was too busy. Our water was not re-filled at all during the entire evening. The bread was stale. We are never going back
2
Food was good but very small portion sizes. 28 SGD for two small mozzarella balls wrapped in prosciutto is a rip off. Pasta with tomato sauce way too heavy on the garlic. Steak was good but not enough mash and 6(!) measly beans is a joke. Would not go back. Even with the 30% voucher still not worth the price.
4
Loved the decor in the restaurant. The food and service were good and it was decently quiet to have a comfortable conversation. Service staff were attentive and polite. A meal for 2 persons with drinks will add up to $150 and above. Overall, it’s a good place to bring a date to for dinner.
4
Every staff were exceptionally good world class. You dont get this in many even 5 star restaurants. Food was good bit rich so save this place for special occasion. Nice classy ambience. Wine pricey but good selection. Many Singaporean customers which for me is indication serves good food.
4
Restaurant have a nice ambience, though caveat is that the ceiling is low hence may become noisy if there is crowd. We went during weekday lunch hence it was quiet & peaceful.Burrata & Beef short rib is good. Lobster is fresh. Dessert wise is average. Overall decent food qualit
4
Came here a couple of times, and food is always consistently good. Bread served during the start was warm and fresh as well. Service was efficient, though servers were not smiling and warm.
5
A lovely and cosy environment for a romantic dinner. Celebrated my wife's birthday there and we loved the food and atmosphere. Service was impeccable and very accommodating.
5
Friend from Europe was amazed by how authentic the food were served. We have been here many times. The lobster pasta, the tenderloin steak, the codfish, burrata with parma ham, balsamic grilled octopus are the must-try!
4
We went for the set lunch and the portions were generous. Service was excellent. Overall very good value.
4
I had the crabmeat angelhair served with generous portion of crab meat. Grilled octopus was also not bad but the tiramisu was too moist and it doesnt have the strong liqueur kick. Service was good as they keep topping up our drinks.
4
One of the few Italian restaurants in Singapore that serves quality burrata, which is a must have dish for my every visit! The rest of the menu is certainly not any less impressive with a well curated selection of pasta, meat, seafood and dessert. Another hidden gem
3
Burlamacco is a nice restaurant in the CBD area of Amoy Street. I consider it one of the better Italian restaurants. However, in a city now full of very decent ristoranti Italiani, the menu is solid, but a bit stale.We'd ordered simple fares like the burrata and carpaccio, and some pasta. All of which were good, but not excellent.The wine selection was good but a bit pricey. The staff were knowledgeable and friendly, perhaps a bit too friendly since at the end, we'd ordered only 2 digestifs for the ladies but were served 3. I told him I didn't want it as I was driving, he put it down anyways and said enjoy! Then we were charged 3 limoncellos, which irked me a bit!However, not wanting to make a big deal out of it, I feel it noteworthy for the review.Overall, the food was good and the atmosphere typical of restaurants in the area. However, @ $510 for 3 for 2 bottles of wine, 2 starters and 2 mains and 3 digestifs, it's not good value for what you get. And that's problematic consider other ristoranti like Osteria Mozza have a great ambience, and similar service and food (if not better) for the same price
5
We were delighted with this surprise find shuffled among a tranquil street without any frill! Once escorted inside, you will be greeted with an impeccably decorated fine dining hall which soothes your mood to regain your taste buds. The fresh bread was a great starting point to begin our dining experience and my palate changed course with the serving of fried calamari as appetizer. The batter was perfectly fried to crisp and I like it very lightly salted. Our dinner started to get more interesting with the arrival of my squid ink risotto, braised nicely between too watery and too starchy. I enjoyed every grain of this staple just as it got me ready for the main course which was a duck leg. The meat was luscious and tender inside, not mentioning the sauce which supplemented the meat perfectly. I wouldn't want to end the night if not stopped by a bloated tummy. This price was a tad below most Italian restaurants with similar standard and the wait staff were great company for the night. Certainly worth a visit
5
This is my go-to place for good pasta. We order the signature lobster linguine and angelâ€™s hair with crab meat sauce. Both were very well prepared. The lobster was fresh and the fresh red chili gave it a fiery punch. Crab meat sauce also had a good amount of crab in it. On Sundays, there is no corkage charge for BYO alcohol.
3
Burrata cheese was nice but for the price you pay it had to be at least of a certain standard and the dish itself was simple to prepare as Long as you had good cheese. The lobster arrabiatta was average, spiciness level not adequately up to level and lobster was not fresh enough. Average food overall for the price you pay, can get better alternatives elsewhere.
5
I have been here a few times now and the food and service is always excellent! Had the calamari for entree and pork ragu for main. The pear tart was also delicious! Will be back!
4
Came here for the set lunch with a friend. Great value for money, the food was really good. The service was prompt as well. Probably more of a business lunch type of place though.
4
The burrata and lobster pasta were excellent. But the Angel hair crab meat pasta was disappointing. There was very little crab meat. Otherwise, service was all right. Although I indicated in my reservation that I was celebrating my husband's birthday, nothing was done.
5
Great italian food, nice ambience, amazing staff and most importantly it was byo so free corkage yay :)
4
Have been there several times now, and service is always good, Italian food is good, as are the wines.
5
I have been to Burlamacco several times before. The food always is so good.This time I tried the pork ragout (Pappardelle with Pork Leg Ragout Marinated 7 Days in Red Wine ). Most excellent. My friend had the "Angel Hair Pasta Served with Crab Meat and Cooked in ‘Bisque’ Sauce". Similarly excellent.For dessert:I was going to order the ‘Pannacotta’, but we were drinking red wine, and the waiter recommended the chocolate related desserts, reminding us that the red wine would over power the Pannacotta. We took their advice, and boy were we glad!We had the 'Crostata’ Chocolate Tart Eruption with Vanilla Ice Cream and a special of the day (Brownie with ice cream). The 'Crostata’ gave new meaning to "to die for". The brownie. I usually do not go for brownies. Most places serve a dried out piece of brownie, warmed up (but still dried out). This was not. It was similar in consistency to the 'Crostata’ (warm and juicy :-) -- very nice
5
We had selected this restaurant to celebrate my daughter’s birthday after reading TA reviews. And it turned out to be a very good choice.We had the lobster tail linguine, crabmeat pasta, beef tenderloin, grilled octopus, tiramisu, pannacotta & chocolate tart. Everything was excellent. Loved the ambience. Service was friendly & attentive.A good choice if you are craving Italian food. The weekday set lunch menu looks good value. Will try it soon
5
Came for business lunch and had the special set menu. I chose chicken and truffle soup, followed by linguine lobster (to die for and even though says spicy it was perfect for a non spice person like me). Had the poached pear filled with panda cotta for dessert. It was all so seriously yummy. Service was swift and personal and their wine selection is great also.
5
Unpretentious Italian Restaurant. Decent Service. Affordable prices. Good food. The rack of lamb is to die for. Probably the best I have tasted. And coming from me, that’s a compliment since I’m not fond of lamb. Give it a try. Desserts are good but plating is tacky! The multi colors confuse me.
5
A group of 6 of us went for brunch on Sunday-not only was it great value but the quality of the food and the customer service was outstanding. The menu consisted of a number of different courses of shared plates, from cold cuts, to lobster pasta, salmon and veal! So much food and then there was dessert! The beverage option was excellent too with espresso martini, a white and red wine.The stand out though was the service. In particular, I would like to call out Elgin who was attentive, friendly and always ensuring our group had everything we wanted. He was also very knowledgeable when it came to wines and I would go back just to experience his service again. We will be back!
5
Good food, environment and service. Definitely will visit the restaurant again.
Our client also like everything from the food to the service.
5
Staff were accommodating and the food was great! Ideal venue for both business and personal occasions.
4
very good italian food in Chinatown, I have been there a few times. I will be happy to come back next time.
4
We had once again great evening in this place. Tried few new dishes like squid ink ravioli and baked sea bass, and can highly recommend them, super delicious. Will be back soon for sure!!
5
fantastic food, fantastic atmosphere and amazing staff. I go there often and am never disapointed!
Will definitely go again and again!
4
Another good night out again. Food was good. Service good. Lemoncello at the end of evening as always was very enjoyable.
5
The food was awesome and the experience was made even better with excellent service. The seafood stew is better than expected. Will need their homemade bread to mop up the soup!
4
Was recommended to Burlamacco by a colleague who frequents this place. Had a celebratory dinner here and made reservations ahead of time, which is recommended as this place did get pretty busy. This place seems to be frequented by regulars as the two ladies at the table next to us appeared to be regulars and it sounded like they were there earlier in the week as well. The restaurant has a dim light setting which I kinda like but LGF felt it was a little too dark. Service was good and attentive and the sommelier, Elgin, is a very friendly guy. We ordered a few dishes to share and because it was date night, there were no photos allowed so sorry guys. What I could remember though was;1. The tuna tartare cleansed the palette.2. Pot of mussels which was a soup was pretty good.3. The pasta with lobster tail was delight and was one of the chef’s recommendations.4. The seafood main reminded us of the bouillabaisse which we both love.Unfortunately we were both so full from the Starters and Mains we didn’t have room for dessert. Had the NZ white wine which was quite nice. Overall, it was a pleasant dining experience and a very memorable date night. Just too bad I don’t have any pics to show for it. Next time then..
4
This is our 2nd visit since August & it was very appreciative that the restaurant manager remembered us. That sets the tone for the evening with their good service & attention. The grilled octopus is highly recommended for antipasti. Mixed seafood was ok, preferred the roast lamb instead, very well cooked. It's great that they have 2 BYO days with free wine corkage
1
we had booked some weeks in advance for a Sunday lunch. As the website tells you, they are open for Sunday lunch. We received a conformation trough an email. 2 days before our lunchdate we received a phone call that the lunch was cancelled. No further explantion!.One should not deal wit customers in this way
4
We went to this place tonight and extremely wonderful food there. Staff is also very polite and kind to help us on the food. Very tasty especially the starters we had. Would definitely recommend people to this place! 👍
4
Great cosy Italian restaurant to bring family and friends.
Food is also really good esp the Tuscan Seafood Stew.
Will definitely visit again :)
4
Burlamacca is another good Italian Restaurant in Singapore. Nice is the BYO offering on Sundays for Lunch. Food is very good. Prices are on the upper end.
4
Food is tasty and i personally recommend the boston lobster linguine. Will come back again next time.
5
Elgin manages to juggle a busy floor as well as providing us with top flight wine service that is knowledgable and friendly. Amazing food - love the papadelle ragu in particular....
5
Its been a while since I had lamb - thanks to my gout. I had a craving for it over the weekend and thought of Burlamacco.
It wasn't good. It was SUPERB!! Must try.
5
Is awesome to be back again.. for sure all the foods speak for itself...amazing...taste to the heart..full to the soul... every visit is new.....thanks to the chefs who cook so amazingly.. and the chef who bring his creation to earth...service is beautiful...love u guys...
4
Food was really tasty and authentic. Price is decent. Service was not up to standard. 2 staff which was not very polite.
5
Definitely one of the most cosy Italian restaurant with friendly sommelier and waiters who are always there to answer each of our request! Food was very reasonably priced for the high quality and taste delicious overall from appetizer to entree to dessert.Great ambiance for a lovely evening whether among friends or family. My favourite italian restaurant in the Amoy/Club street stretch
4
i am a fish person. Love the tenderly roasted sea bass. Into red meat? Try lamb of rack. Moist and succulent. For more artery hardening stuff, tomahawk steak is ideal.(comes with truffle fries and salad) Before mains, consider tuna tartare, buratta on tomato, baked aubergine with cheese, and trip stew. These are a few of my favourite things...I am told that some kids like the dinner rolls.Fresh and crispy. I agree
4
Service was good. For the food, the mushroom soup, pana ham wrapped with cheese, ravoli pasta and dessert taste yummy.
5
Excellent food! The service was superb! Nice ambiance too! Will definitely recommend this place to my friends.
3
This is a nice place for a meal, lunch or dinner.
Food is good.
Service is ok and ambience is nice....
4
Super posh Italian resto, great service and quality food. Good for couples for a romantic night out. Had the pastas and desserts- loved the pear tart. Great deal with AMEX 50% off!
5
Food here ia eeally delicious and the buratta is excellent.
The wine sommelier was v friendly n gave good recommendations
3
Burlamacco continues to serve hearty Italian meal after my repeated visits. Taste wise, continues to remain at high standard. Unfortunately, the restaurant is seriously understaff with only 2 service staff for the entire night. The management should really look at improving the service standard.
5
Great value for the money, nicest free flow wine in town with a great sommelier.
Should I keep it a secret?
5
We loved it! Great food, wine selection is really good
Maybe a bit pricey but like everything in Singapore
4
Our favourites included the pappardelle with pork leg ragout ($30) and ravioli with ricotta cheese in sage sauce ($26). The linguine with Boston lobster tail in spicy Arrabbiata sauce ($32) was pretty good too, though a few members of our party felt that the Arrabbiata sauce somewhat drowned out the flavour of the lobster. We finished off the meal with the lovely tiramisu ($18) and panna cotta ($12) - I daresay the panna cotta is one of the best that I've had in Singapore.The restaurant wasn't crowded when we went for dinner on a Sunday, which meant that we could converse comfortably. With the decently-sized portions and '25% off a la carte food' promotion on Chope, it was definitely value-for-money!
4
Burlamacco located in a modest 60-seat shop house space at 77 Amoy Street, beautifully ambience with hanging lamps in black and orange shades, walls adorned with colourful paintings and red banquette seats in an unpretentious space decked out in wood furnishings. Banking on Tuscan heritage flavours, Burlamacco serves up a menu of Tuscan classics augmented with pan-Italian favourites of appetizers, pastas, fish, meats and desserts. All dishes are served to the table were delicious appetizers, scrumptious and of course sinful desserts, Would highly recommend Burlamacco to any-one who enjoys great Italian food & hospitality at fantastic value.. Staff were attentive, professional and friendly, absolutely faultless. Anyhow the food was delicious, some of the tastiest Italian food I've eaten in SGP. The prices are definitely high, but I guess that is the way in Singapore everything is quite inflated. However with such an exquisite experience we are looking forward to going back soon
4
Especially liked the seafood stew. Was on amex 1-1 promotion. The service is nice and warm. Setting is cosy
5
This is my 2nd time dining in this restaurant. I simply love the food, the atmosphere and the service from the service staff.
4
The food is very delicious and generous portion. definitely recommend for business lunch. The ambience is nice and conducive for business discussion.
5
Ordered the set lunch. The food was excellent, grilled prawn was nice, beef patty was cooked right and I like the hazel hut ice cream dessert as it's not too sweet. Portion was filling and value for money.
3
Had the set lunch. Unfortunately the dishes weren't fantastic. The stuffed squid was distinctly average. Donuts were cold and particularly tasteless. Ala carte menu was good though. Lobster pasta was pretty exceptional. Free bread was also quite nice. Fairly crowded during lunch but service wasn't too slow thankfully.
5
It was a last minutes reservation due to other prior commitment and was blessed to be able to have a booking with the restaurant. We were also blessed to meet Grace in person who took my telephone reservation and assuring me that she will take care of everything for that evening since we are celebrating our Wedding Anniversary.Since it was our first time in this Italian restaurant and also having very high expectation on Italian food, was quite worried that the quality of the drinks and food would not be even near original Italian way of cooking which turn out to surpass our expectation, especially their balsamic grilled octopus and their pasta.We finished our meals with their desert Frangipane, the pear tart served with hazelnut ice cream that complete the dinner.Grace and her fellow colleagues were also very attentive to our needs and call whenever we need something. Would definitely go back again for our usual crave for Italian food
4
One is not short of food choices in Singapore. Singapore is one of the culinary gems of the world. I don't suggest that Burlamacco is in the very top tier of restaurants in Singapore but it certainly deserves to be in the top. The food and service was good. The restaurateur greeted us when we entered and made sure we were seated and started the service. The food was done simply and well. The squid ink risotto was excellent and the tripe stew is recommended. The slow cooked short ribs were beautifully done. The tiramisu was ok. Nothing special there.Reasonably priced and good place for a quiet evening out
5
I've already let a review to Burlamacco Ristorante a few years back but thought the consistency of the quality of Food, of the cooking and of the service deserved a new heads up. The Cacciucco was superb, the traditional black squid Risotto unbelievable and the Tenderloin couldn't have been better. Grace and Elgin did a fantastic job, efficient, fun, caring, discreet, fast. A real treat to (finally) been served by Hospitality pros. Even Chef Gabriele took the time to inquire about our lunch and to share some kitchen secrets. Congrats Burlamacco (Dream) Team
5
I hardly go to Italian restaurants while abroad as I am often disappointed. However this was a great surprise and I will definitely be back!. the black ink risotto was just perfect, great texture, the right amount full of flavour. The Octopus, while grilled was still very tender and fresh. Great service, very attentive but not intrusive. Great place overall
5
My friend and I had pasta and the calamari. The calamaris were so fresh and soft. The dipping sauce was awesome too.We had Tagliatelle Pasta Served Beef Bolognese Ragu & Pappardelle with Pork Leg Ragout Marinated 7 Days in Red Wine. They were very good. It's a place that I will go back again. The sommerlier recommended a nice half bottle for us too.
4
Some very good adn tasty dishes. I have been there a few times, I will definitely come back. A reliable place for Italian food in Singapore
5
Fantastic squid ink pasta! Portion is decently filling. They have BYOB on selected weekdays at 0 corkage fee so I will defo be back on those days! Great place to bring your plus one for special occassions too.
4
Everything was TOP notch. Food is fresh, well prepared and Elgin does a beautiful wine pairing. A great place to go.
4
If you're looking for sensibly priced unfussy Italian food, this is the place. The linguine lobster is always excellent, and the pork ragout is great. Happy to recommend, and will go again.
5
The staff were very attentive and friendly and the food was very good. The Mussels had a very tasty sauce. The Calamari were crispy and just right. The Linguine "al dente" and the beef cooked just right. We also loved the "old School" decor. Great Dinne
4
The food is nice, especially their signature dish which is the Lobster Linguine is very tasty.The price can be felt a bit high, but for set Lunch Menu, it worth the price as you can enjoy coffee or dessert together. So you do not have to move to coffee shop after the meal
4
Serves great pasta. Linguine with Boston lobster tail was excellent as usual since that is their signature dish. The lobster was very juicy. Angle's hair with crab meat sauce was also very good; maybe chunks of crab meat will make it better? BYO wine on Tuesdays and Sundays, there is no corkage fee. Small restaurant but very nicely done up.
3
I have relatively high standards and I am particular about Italian, French and Indian food. With that disclaimer, my husband and I went to this restaurant last week for a nice romantic dinner, and we were not that impressed. First off, the decor of the restaurant is nice and romantic, with soft lighting and red plush chairs. But it was entirely too noisy for a nice romantic date. The service is good, with very friendly waiters.Pish-posh, onto the food. We ordered the pan-fried mozzarella with ham, and the beef carpaccio as starters. The pan-fried mozzarella was interesting but nothing to rave about. The beef carpaccio (served with mushrooms, leaves, balsamic vinegar AND parmesan) was just.... weird. It felt like a culinary experiment gone wrong, there was too much going on with that dish, and it took away from the carpaccio flavour completely. Though normally we order meat dishes, we decided to be adventurous and order the pasta dishes, ricotta raviolo with truffle and squid ink risotto. Both were just above mediocre, and in my opinion, way too salty. Maybe we just ordered the wrong dishes, but overall, I was not impressed with this restaurant. If I had to pay full price for it, I would not have gone, knowing what I know now
5
I had a spinach salad and mussels soup before main course. Salad was little but it was very yummy. The best was the mussels soup. Portion was good for sharing and can taste white wine in the soup. Had seafood stew as main which was a big portion. Very satisfying
5
Visited it early 7pm located on within the the business district shop house .Beautiful ambience great decor .As we had pre booked quickly shown our table .We left the chef to make the menu as different religious health diets .Treated to great food service plates taken away after each round staff good ,the owner Gabriella made rounds and helped with all the work only 3 staff but no lack and looked after by all always smiling.Great food wine would always go back for more
4
Third time here and the quality of the food has been consistent. Seafood is always fresh. Service is good too.
5
Great service, great good, great wine. Definitely recommend the tomahawk steak... amazing. We have been many times and Always had an excellent experience.
4
Requested for tiramisù first as my friends haven't arrived. Authentic and soft yummy dessert. Ordered the lobster pasta. I don't like tomato based sauce. But this was nice!
4
Definitely one of the best Italian restaurant in Singapore. Whether it is from starter, soup, entree to dessert, the food are well executed from taste to plating. Really impressed with the service all around!
4
The food here is very good. The linguine with lobster was very tasty, as were the Burrata and tiramisu. The bread appeared to have been microwaved so not good. Service is efficient though not exactly warm. The dining room itself lacks any character or appeal. The food really is the redeeming factor here
3
Rustic and homely feel; suitable for big groups (we went as group of 10 for lunch). Food was tasty with decent selection (there wasn't any standout dish - not everyone in our group had consistent feedback on any particular one dish). Service was mixed (my side of the table had a positive experience while the other end of the table complained of poor attitude from the waitress). Overall, good value for money for set lunches.
5
We went there for dinner with some friends from out of town and it was our first time there also so really didn't know what to expect other than the reviews I had read. The restaurant has a nice atmosphere to it and not too noisy which is nice. We all ordered only a main course but everyone said the same thing "delicious"! The wine we chose was also good and had a great discussion with the Sommelier as well. All the staff were friendly and there was no sense of trying to get us out of the restaurant even though we were almost the last to leave. I know I will be back to try more of the delicious food
5
We have lost count as to how many times we have been to Burlamacco. It never EVER fails to disappoint: whether it is a function; a family meal; a romantic couple's dinner or sharing a fantastic meal with our friends. The service is amazing and consistently of an exceptionally high standard. Chef/owner Gabriele has created a true piece of Italy right here in Singapore.But let's talk about the food! The food is out of this world! So much choice, no matter what you choose you will not be disappointed. If you want to know my absolute favourites they are: mouthwatering burrata with Parma ham and tomato, followed by a pasta (squid ink risotto or pappardelle ragout or any of the pastas on the menu really!), then the 48 hour slow cooked rib (please don't miss the opportunity to try this dish - it melts in your mouth!) and finished with an exquisite tiramisu. Add a superb wine list expertly navigated by Elgin (Sommelier Extraordinaire) and fabulous espresso martinis, you have a truly special meal. Every...single...time.
5
Cosy & nice restaurant . We ordered the set lunch & told the waitress its meant to be shared among the 2 of us. The crabcake was delicious, the beetroot chickpea quinoa salad refreshing. We would like to complement the waitress of being very thoughtful to portion our main of lobster linguine into 2 plates for us upon serving. Overall a very pleasant dining experience
5
Good Italian restaurants in Singapore often cost an arm and a leg with the "No Menu" restaurant on Boon Tat street being a good example . Burlamacco provides a competitive option at more affordable prices . The Burata is to die for . I had the squid ink fettuccine which I stopped eating only when the ceramic glazing of my plates threatened to come off due to me wiping and polishing every smidgeon of the pasta sauce with my bread . Portions are decent ( bordering on large) and the quality of the produce excellent . The wine is a bit pricey ( but that is Singapore) . The only "complaint " I have is that the restaurant seems understaffed for peak hours and the 3 waiters although busy like ants are difficult at times to catch hold off.Tip : Don't miss the desserts or the wrk day set lunch which is an absolute value for money
4
The service and environment is good and nice. Food wise unique and taste was alright but quite saltish. Will be better if less salty.
5
A pleasant change to the usual overpriced food and poor service one associates with places such as Dempsey Hill. Great location, friendly staff and good service make it a pleasure to dine.
5
Really great place with fabulous food. Been here numerous times and it never fails to impress. Staff are friendly and knowledgeable about the food. Wine selection is vast and the lemoncello is home made and the best I've ever tasted! Would highly recommend.
4
Staff were friendly and the food was quite good. The quail was a tad over, but pasta were pretty good
4
My wife and I visited on a Friday night. Had tuna tartar on avocado which was very good. Slow-cooked need short ribs was melt-in-your-mouth but unlike the braised version, had a wonderful smoky aroma
Pleasantly surprised. A tad pricey though
5
This is a lovely personalized restaurant where the owner cum chef will be around while you dine. The Trippa is to die for and if you like fries, go for the truffle fries. We had lamb chop and it was done to perfection! The chef could also customized your order not on the menu. The waitresses are friendly and the restaurant ambiance is simply great both for business or romantic meals depending where the location of the restaurant. The price of wine is a little high. Can't complaint when we were offered complimentary home made lemoncello to end our meal.
4
I never knew this restaurant till we found it in the list of discounted restaurants under the Amex love dining program and it turned out to be a great choice. The food is great and the portion sufficient coupled with nice environment and impeccable service. Only thing is that I may think twice about coming if there isn't the 50% discount on a la carte food items from Amex.
5
This has become my fave italian restaurant because of the burrata and mussels. A huge ball of cheese with juicy fresh tomatoes and warm toastie breads are delights to the palate.My other fave is the mussels in soup which are so delicately fresh and juicy! Another recommendation, a personal fave of my fiancÃ©, is the beef short rib.I have tried almost all the pastas and pizzas. Wonderful desserts too. Fave Italian restaurant!
4
If you are looking for your pasta cook in the al dente way, this is the restaurant to dine at.I've tried the angel hair pasta with crab meat ($30) and home-made squid ink fettuccine with prawns ($28), it was so al-denteFriendly and cheerful service crew make you feel at home
3
Attended a birthday dinner with a lady friend on a Tuesday night. To my surprise, the often quiet and elegant restaurant became loud and noisy. Ordered their spinach salad which was well executed with right amount of acidity. Lobster linguine was great as usual and grilled seabass is fresh but a bit dry (maybe waited too long to be served as the bottom part of the skin starts to get soggy). The key issue I had was the service, the restaurant was clearly understaffed and notwithstanding the waiters and waitresses mad rushing customers' requests, it took quite awhile for them to notice us. The management should look at improving the service by recruiting more staff, if not service will suffer and affect business in the long run
5
Wonderful staff, service and food quality, really appreciated the extra care of the staff to make our dinner experience memorable. Will definitely be back for more meals.
5
We had burrata cheese to start (unbelievably fantastic) pasta lobster, whole baked seabass, beef tenderloin and finish off with panacotta... no words to describe... from the moment we enter the restaurant till the moment we left the restaurant. Everything was fantastic!! Kudos!!
5
The food was amazing, especially the fish dish. I had a lobster pasta, it was really delicious.
Also I took a chocolate lava cake, it was one of the best
3
The ambience was very inviting and pleasant but we felt that the pasta and shellfish soup dishes (lobster with linguine) were too salty.
4
The restaurant had good service and good food, but nothing extraordinary to want me to come back. The beef rib was well cooked and was very nice. The homemade pasta was ok. The restaurant had a nice ambiance and a good selection of wine.
4
We had the octopus tentacles for entree, pork ragu paradalle, seafood stew and the tiramisu. All dishes are very good. especially the seafood stew.

Relaxing atmosphere, hearty Italian food with Wine was just nice for business lunch on Wednesday. Lunchtime is usually full and mostly ordering their lunch set. (3 courses)
5
Great service, great food, great ambience. Attentive staff!! Made reservations via chope, indicated it's for wedding anniversary. Surprised by how they decorated the desserts we ordered, indicating "Happy anniversary" and with a candle. Happy surprise!!
5
Nice food and place for dining for any occasion. will visit more often and will recommend more people

Came here out of curiosity. Looks old with 90s decorNo set dinnet. We opted for a la carte. My beef tripe was ok and i didn't know italians eat tripe like the chinese. My friend's raw tuna also looked blahMy cod was not seasoned enough. My friend's quail looked undercooked and bloody. I wouldn't finish it but he didWe had to pour some of the wine ourselves. Service wasn't particularly attentiv
3
Pushy waiters, pouring wine too fast and spotty food wuality. Some excellent dishes (the lamb) but pastas disappointing
5
Chef Gabriel and his sommelier Elgin were really wonderful hosts. We had the fresh mozarella which was to die for. Flavored were impeccable and the portions were good.
5
Definitely one of my go to Italian restaurants whenever I am in Singapore. Service is excellent, food is reliably good and made with care, and the lunch set is very reasonably priced and for all these reasons, I just keep going back!

Friends chose this restaurant due to reviews for my birthday. The food and service was average, was not up to expectations as what the other reviews have described. Quite a disappointing birthday meal.
4
Unlike the other pretentious Italian restaurants that have populated the Amoy/Club Street scene, Burlamacco is a straight forward Italian restaurant that serves hearty Italian home cooked fares that is big on flavour and PORTION as well. What might seem to be a bit pricey for the seafood stew is actually well worth the wait and money as the ingredients are fresh and comes in generous portion. Dessert was very well executed as well and reasonably priced. Will be back again to try other recommended dishes.

Love the food here. Started well with the hot bread rolls dipped into the balsamic vinegar and olive oil. The burrata together with the parma ham was awesome. Enjoyed the truffle fries too. Our main courses were seafood stew, which was very tasty, linguine w lobster tail, pappardelle in pork leg ragout and tagliolini w sea urchin in saffron cream sauce were great and the squid ink risotto was creamy and rich. Helpings were substantial so we have only place for one dessert, the Chocolate eruption tart w vanilla ice-cream. Set back was our wine which was priced $78 on the menu was charged at $98 which they claimed, the menu was not updated. Overall food was excellent!
5
I love this place. The food never disappoints. I took a visiting Italian friend and I'd told him it was the best Italian restaurant in Singapore, so my reputation was on the line. He was not only super-impressed, but also recommended other Italian friends of his to try it soon!The service is also outstanding, helpful and friendly yet unobtrusive.Splurge on the burrata - it's worth it
3
Went there to celebrate my birthday. First impression was the lukewarm greeting we had when greeted and showed to our table. Not the kind of service expected.First impressions count but gave it the benefit of the doubt. Had the beef carpaccio, not overly impressed with it. Was nice, but had better. There was a mixed up with our mains. Ordered seafood stew but was brought a steak, slight confusion with the order there. I had the squid inked pasta with seafood, which was nice. The seafood stew was equally nice as well. I had the tiramisu which as so-so. Our overall experience could have been better, one of the saving graces apart from the mains, was Elgin. He was very friendly and well-versed in his wines
5
Always looking for Italian places that give me the "home kitchen" feel, and this place does in spades. The staff are like friends after a few short visits and I love the free BYO policy on Sundays and Tuesdays.Favourite dish is fresh pasta with the smoked paprika tomato sauce. Simple, expert and just right
4
Visited this place in conjunction with Singapore Restaurant week. We tried the set menus. The burrata was really smooth and tasty. The duck leg salad was also nice and wasn't too strong in its duck taste. The Boston lobster linguine was full of flavour, a healthy portion and tasty pieces of lobster cooked just right . For me the beef short ribs was THE DISH . Soft , succulent, marinated superbly - melted in the mouth. Italian desserts are the hallmark of a very good Italian restaurant. We tried the panacotta served with Sea salt caramel and the crostata oven baked chocolate with hazelnut ice cream- both were excellent , I would highly recommend the panacotta for it smoothness, texture and how the sweetness blended with the sea salt gives you a wonderful ending to the meal.Our waiter , a really jovial and friendly chap , who is also a sommelier , made our evening more enjoyable with his wit and menu suggestions.Definitely worth another visit or 2 , especially the short ribs 
4
The set lunch is great value with reasonable quality food. Ordered the tomato soup and grilled butter fish. The soup was wonderful and full of flavour. The grilled fish was quite average. Good ambience and it's easy to find a quiet table.
5
Had a business lunch there and was taken care of very well by Elgin. Their seafood stew has generous pieces of fish and prawns, and a rich broth.
5
This is my third time at burlamacco. Star dishes to mention are the squid ink fettuccini with seafood and 48HR slow cooked beef rib. They also serve complimentary bread that is made in-house. Really stellar food, I recommend it very much!
4
Service was generally excellent and food good. However, I requested for extra spicy arrabiata for my pasta, and was served instead a totally non-spicy tomato based pasta. They did offer to change it though, but I didn't want to waste what was already served. Otherwise it was a good meal
4
This place ( BURLAMACCO) aims to bring out a relaxed and happy atmosphere, which is clearly emphasized with their good-humored and staff regularly joking, itâ€™s a place which has gathered a local following due to its good quality of food. Nonetheless I had positive reviews from my other associates who previously dined, and I must confess on my visit We had a Delightful evening, great food, especially the burrata it was soooo creamy and delicious, The squid ink risotto cooked to perfection and the Pappardelle with Pork Ragout where to die for, And the pasta dish, we had the Linguine with Lobster in Spicy Arrabiata Sauce another winner. The staff provide excellent and attentive services without being invasive. Enjoyable night we will be back!
4
We went for lunch here on a weekday. The place was packed with office folks, which was a good sign :)The service was very warm and efficient.The food was tasty, and value for money depended on what was ordered.The complimentary bread that was served was warm, just the way we like it. Mentioning this specifically since many mid-range restaurants serve cold bread most of the times.The set lunch was fabulous value for money and very tasty. We found the Buratta a little on the higher side, but tasted delicious. The ala carte order for pasta was also good.Would surely consider going back for a meal
4
We went on a Wednesday evening to celebrate birthday. Despite being told, the restaurant does not do anything special. Restaurant is located about 15mins walk away from Telok Ayer MRT station at 77 Amoy Street. There is parking available along side the street, parallel parking. We ordered 3 starters, Burrata, chipped red tuna and grilled octopus. All 3 starters taste awesome, fresh n clean taste. For mains, we had the pork and lobster tail tomato based pasta. Pretty good. We also had beef ribs and pork tenderloin. These were nicely grilled. We shared the dishes we ordered. The portion is adequate. We didn't have any room for dessert. Spent $303 for 4 pax without any drinks and dessert.
5
Had the brunch set here and was blown away by the amount of grub on offer for such a reasonable price. They bring you the whole lot to the table, sizeable portions and you have the option of topping up for free flow Prosecco. We opted not to and just barely made it through the whole menu without bursting at the seams. Food was absolutely delicious, the ambiance lovely and the staff really sweet and friendly. The mascots all over the restaurant were a nice touch. Our only gripe is that the plates came at one go, leaving one cold while we finished the other.
5
Ate here for the second time on a Saturday night and brought five friends to celebrate a bridal shower. Gabriele and his staff were very friendly and attentive, and we had a good time. The bread to start with was warm, crusty on the outside and fluffy on the inside. We ordered calamari, tuna with avocado, truffle fries and ministrone soup to share, and all were well-received by the party - one of my friends (who has tried lots of truffle fries) said they were the best truffle fries she's eaten. For the mains, we had four different sauces - crab, pork ragout, porcini, and bolognese - with a range of pastas such as ravioli and gluten free penne. Everything was very flavourful and the servings were just right (a little on the large side). Really recommend the chocolate tart for dessert! The first time I came here was on a date so it's a nicely versatile place, cosy and classy at the same time. Will be back :
5
We ordered the angel hair with crab meat in bisque, beef short ribs and the Chocolate tart with vanilla ice cream. All three dishes were delicious! The quality of food is top notch. Ambience is nice too! Definitely recommended. Do note the menu cab be pricey.
5
One of the best dining experience I have ever had. We were here to celebrate my son's birthday. Service is too notch. Just to mention we dined on a Sunday.
5
Love the interior, love the food. Cod was super fresh and perfect portion. Service was good too. The lady who attended to us was very polite.
4
Good value for money Sunday brunch with free flow of bubbly and wine when you make a reservation thru Chope website.
4
Went there and enjoyed their signature lobster pasta as always. Well balanced sauce and nice whole piece of lobster.
5
Personable service. The waiting staff was friendly, very helpful and knowledgeable about the food they were selling. The food was wonderful of course. Great value for money.The restaurant had a nice thematically coherent design and great ambience. It was quiet enough to have a conversation without having to shout.
4
Had a birthday celebration with my family there. The food is excellent. We ordered Burrata and Foie Gras and they took our order wrongly and served us a Tuna Tartare instead but the Tuna is very nice and we thought just stick to it but they gave us free and never charge us for it . This is what you call good servicefor the main we had lobster pasta , vegetarian pasta and truffle pasta and they are all yummy. We also ordered the short ribs and lamb and I love these two meat dish especially the lamb is so soft and melts in the mouth.Every Tue and Sun is BYO but I think they have good selection of wine there as well. Overall value for money and we definitely go back especially. Thank you Algin for the excellent service and the digestive it was very nice.The only thing that have been missed out is I have indicated the dinner is for birthday celebration would hv been nice if they hv a small surprise for the birthday gal.But anyhow it has been a wonderful
5
Had the buratta (with the parma ham) for starters and it was once of the most amazing thing I've tasted. Wonderfully creamy texture and really melts in your mouth like ice-cream. The cheese goes really well with the parma harm as well as the Italian tomatoes at the side. Really a must try.Girlfriend had the squid ink fettuccine which was top value. The pieces of scallops, prawns, fish were very fresh and tasty. Pasta was very well cooked. I had the signature lobster pasta. Really loved the arriabata sauce which balances the generous slice of lobster very well.Will definitely be going back
5
It is an ala carte brunch menu which changes every 2 weeks. The restaurant keeps the menu small (4 starters, 2 Secondi, 2 Primi, 2 Dolce) . Quality is superb despite the small offerings on the brunch menu. Bottega prosseco is served with brunch. The Pinot Grigio and Chianti were not my taste though. Alcohol aside, the servers really take care of you, promoting their food and they are qualified sommeliers too. Love It!
5
What an experience! Elgin took fantastic care of us and the whole experience was perfect, a stark contrast to the nightmare we had at Alkaff Mansion. Highly recommend the lamb rack :) Elgin took us into the wine cellar to select the wine - a first in any Italian I've been to in Singapore including Forlino, Piedra Santa, Oso, Prego et
5
Every visit , we were greeted by the Executive Chef & Owner with his recommendation for the day. Food is always delicious , good quality cooked to your preference. Staff are very friendly , initiative & entertaining. Starters are sumptuous , pastas & risotto are delicious, steaks are tender & juicy. Many mouth watering choices for desserts !!
4
My friend celebrated my birthday at Burlamacco and it was our first time there. I would say the food is good and service was awesome ! Thanks Elgin Vincent for a pleasant surprise and it made our day !! #pleasantexperience #unforgettablebirthday
4
I've been going to Burlamacco for a few years. The food is always good, the service excellent. Try the red tuna tartare for appetizers, the squid ink Risotto for mains.
5
Excellent quality, service and value at this resturant. The Sunday Brunch is particularly good. The food is served freshly cooked a la carte.
5
Wonderful evening at this hidden gem. Clearly only the best produce will do for Burlamacco. The wine cellar is worth a visit in itself!
3
It was our first visit to this restaurant at Amoy street. The food quality was good but unfortunately there was a very big group having lunch at the same time. They were having lots of fun, I guess but their behaviour was affecting others customers, including u
4
great Sunday Recovery Brunch - amazing deal and we loved the food so much. Really value for money. The Pasta and Risotto were on point! My friend and I had a great time with the free flow prosecco and wines as well. Super lively atmosphere! Definitely going back to try other dishes on their menu!

It was not the first I visited this restaurant. In the past it had always been okay, if not fantastic. However, the last Brunch just threw a surprising bad experience to me and the friend I invited to try out this place.Good food & ambience, yes; service staff being friendly and helpful, yes; all these were ruined when a self-claimed restaurant manager showed up at our table and threw some really unexpected bad attitude at us as if we were liars and not professionals with high social status. I used a promotional offer from a high-end lifestyle club, my name was on the guest list, still out of respect I confirmed it the day before as well as the same day before the brunch started. Still this "manager" first accused us trying to use an offer which was not available anymore; then instead of checking the guest list and booking record, she was forcing me to produce evidence that there is such offer - it was so ridiculous to be treated like that at this just mediocre eatery. I and my friends dine out a lot, mostly fine-dining, and such rude unprofessional treatment never occurred at any of the much more high-end restaurants, including the times when we entertained offers from a lifestyle club or a highly privileged card. All 4 of my friends were visiting this venue for the first time because of it's not well-known, and all 4 were shocked by how rude she was towards us. To make things worse, when I decided to give the manager my feedback, she claimed to be the manager, denied her rudeness, and never gave us an apology. It simply was unacceptable.I reported this incident to the founder of the lifestyle club who's also a good friend of mine. Most likely, this will be the last time I or any of my 4 friends will ever visit Burlamacco again.
5
Chef Gabriele went the extra miles to keep his patrons happy. Have been visiting this restaurant for over a year now and Was there last night. We wanted finger food with our drinks but it's not something the restaurant serves. Gabriele worked his magic and basically impressed every girls' tastebuds! Another amazing night with Burlamacco, a great place to entertain regardless if it's for business or leisure. You always get great service and sometimes too overwhelming attention from Chef Gabriele!!! Oh and not forgetting Burlamacco has the best lemonchello I had so far!!
4
We just celebrated my son's birthday at the restaurant. It was our first time there and the food and service exceeded our expectation. Although the restaurant was quite crowded, we were warmly greeted by the staff, Elgin was very friendly and the owner himself who was coming by often making sure we were well taken care of.
4
Tucked in the middle of the exotic Amoy Street was Burlamacco Ristorante where me and the missus made our first visit.We were instantly greeted by the head chef/ owner who put in a personal touch to each and every customer for a burgeoning lunch hour.For starter we went for the red tuna with avocade battuta, and the raw tuna truly meted well with the avocado slices and it definitely helped to whet our appetites.It was pretty prompt when the main course arrived with my wife was overwhelmed in the good sense with the seafood-loaded Cacciucco, meanwhile I also went for lobster with my spicy arrabbiata pasta which turned out to be a great choice.To finish off this culinary adventure was the desert as we went the conservative route picking the tiramisu and the affogato.I really enjoyed the tiramisu, the sweetness was not lingering and it complimented with the after meal coffee.We both felt compelling for a return visit to try on other items on the menu in the future; the only shortcoming on the otherwise favorable ambience is that it could be a bit warm in the afternoon especially where we were sitting below the skylight windows
5
My friend recommended this restaurant and the food was great. I especially like the cod fish and the slow cooked beef short rib. Appertiser cheese with Parma ham is a must have. The grilled octopus portion was relatively small for the price.
4
I had the octopus leg and lobster pasta, husband had same starter and a beef main. Food was excellent... Especially the octopus which I highly recommend.
5
Love the food. Ambience is good. Food is a little pricey. The red meat is nicer than the fish. Dessert and soup is awesome.
3
Overall, it was satisfactory. Loved the cozy atmosphere of the restaurant though the food was overpriced for the standard.
5
Was very pleasantly surprised with our meal at Burlamacco, as did not know about it prior. The food was excellent...very fresh and very tasty. The staff was very friendly and very attentive. Overall a very positive experience
4
Nice restaurant - friendly waiters and good food. We were rewards with a free drink at the end of our meal that was a nice touch.
4
If you are looking for great tasting authentic Italian cuisine at a reasonable price then i thoroughly recommend this restaurant. The menu had lots of great choices Even the chef stopped by for a chat and the service crew was excellent This will now be a regular stop on our frequent visits to Singapor
5
Decided to head down for brunch with friends. At $58++ per Pax, we thought it was great value for the quality we were offered. Brunch was served alacarte buffet style. Sommelier waiter Eljin was friendly, knowledgeable and a pleasure to talk to. We ordered whisky sour and the bartender prepared the drink to perfection. Such a great experience, great way to spend a Sunday morning/ afternoon
4
Booked here for the Mothers Day Sunday Brunch. There was an excellent variety of food and plenty of it! We were absolutely stuffed by the end. My wife had the free flow option which was only $20 extra with free flow wine and prosecco. My only negative feedback relates to the speed of service. At times it appeared a little haphazard as we had different waiters and had to chase drinks a couple of time, but a minor point. Overall excellent value and would go again.
5
I really enjoyed myself with two mothers , my wife (mother of my two children) and my own mother. The sommelier Elgin Vincent really made us comfortable and the food was amazing and excellent value :). I cannot wait to come back and try out their wines next time.
4
Ordered:
Lamb rack (good)
Lobster linguini (excellent)
Sautéed mushrooms (average, too oily)
Buffalo mozzarella and Parma ham (excellent)
Expensive, about $70 per person, will dine again. Go with chef recommendations, won't go wrong!
5
my wife and i were both impressed with their set menu for lunch. Both the appetisers as well as the both courses were delicious! Good value too for $35+
5
Ordered beef sirloin main dish, soft like beef cheek and great sauce, not too empowering. Worthy of repeat visit. Despite its classy decor, they are super baby friendly (as long as baby doesn't break things I guess)
4
Had lunch at this restaurant and was very pleasantly surprised to be welcomed by the Chef himself, Mr Uberto Bonetti with a wide smile. That put us at ease as this was the 1st time dinning her and do not know what to expect. The atmosphere was good and it is ideal for business lunch or dinner. The ceiling has a glass roof with the light shinning in and make the whole place very bright. We had1) Airflown Burrata, it is nice and fortunately we shared this starter as it is really big.2) Balsamic Grilled Octopus - the octopus is so tender and tasty3) Black mussel cooked in white wine - the mussel fresh is just the right texture4) Linguine with Boston Lobster Tail - the lobster tail is so fresh and tender5) 48 hour slow cooked beef short ribs - that is the highlight of the menu, the meat just melt in the mouth6) Tiramisu - acceptable but not to my liking7) Crostata chocolate tart eruption with vanilla ice cream - very refreshingWe enjoyed the meal very much and will definitely come agai
1
I booked a table to celebrate a friend's birthday due to the raving reviews. Unfortunately it fell short of expectations. We ordered two set lunches which turned out average - a rating point was deducted as the food wasn't worth the price paid; another was deducted for poor service. To commemorate the occasion, I had requested an idling staff to take a photo of us (the food was unmemorable). He promptly replied that he was busy, his staff were busy too and proceeded back to his corner to stare at the 20% filled restaurant, leaving us bewildered. When paying the bill, I requested another wait staff to do the same and he acceded with a smile and did so in less than a minute (the saving grace of our meal). The rude encounter with the particular staff sealed my decision never ever to visit Burlamacco again.
2
Heard good reviews but my set lunch experience was not good. Similar comments as another recent reviewer : fish was too salty , liver pate starter crumbly and too simply prepared. Fish dish also seemed like a strange assembly of incoherent pieces (esp the tomato relish which was out of place and did not compliment anything else on the plate... I suspect it was there to add Colour). desert pastry was inedible because it was so hard you can't break it up with the metal spoon - the dish was definitely not meant to be picked up with fingers. Not worth the price .
5
We have been to this restaurant twice. Once with a big group for celebration, and once for just three. The restaurant is simple, comfortable, with a nice arrangement that has energy, but is not over the top. The Burrata cheese app is the best I have had outside of Italy and Switzerland! All of the meals tried have been very good and full of flavour.Even though everything is great...the service is even better. The owner often greets you, and remembers your name, while checking that everything is right. It makes a difference. Really enjoyed, and highly recommend
2
The hot crispy bun started off our evening well & so did the 2 glasses of wine. However we soon noticed the service staff were not too friendly and doesn't seem to be happy or proud of what they were doing. No smiles and no friendly chat at all even though the restaurant wasn't even half full. I have indicated that I was celebrating my friend's birthday that night and was kinda surprised that that indication was totally omitted or forgotten. Don't think I will recommend or go back again.
3
The bread was warm, crispy n good. My 2 friends and I ordered d burrata n it was excellent, linguini with lobster and this dish was just passable. I've eaten better pasta. I would rate the Tuscan seafood stew which was their speciality a 3-1/2 As a higher tier restaurant We expected better n friendlier service n food. Would not be going back. By the way, this dinner was for a birthday celebration n my friend informed d restaurant when reservation was made but no attempt was made by the restaurant to make it "special" for d b/d person
1
Overpriced for suboptimal food. Appetizers- artichoke soup is tasteless, chicken terrine taste worse than food court food. Main course - mackerel is overly salty, mashed potato tasted coarse; even the signature main which is the lobster linguine is poorly executed. The lobster doesn't taste fresh, the noodles undercooked and the sauce is salty and oily, not tasty at all.Lots of mono sodium glutamate. Made us felt thirsty after the meal.Horrible dessert. Overall, will never go to this restaurant again, the good reviews are all lies
5
I've never been disappointed each time I have been there - food is very good (I have to say I almost always have the seafood stew which is awesome), nice ambience and service is excellent - there when you need them but not intrusive.
4
Excellent service with good ambience. Manager and waiter were very attentive. Quality of food is exceptional even for simple dish like calamari.
5
The food was fantastic, the serving staff was very attentive. Really enjoyed my lunch there. Definitely will visit again
5
Great & tasty food! Good service and attentive staff! The linguine with lobster tail was delicious. The bread was fresh and tasty as well!
5
Whilst there appear to be some mixed reviews, my experience was excellent. The restaurant had absolutely no problems supporting a Gluten Free menu and the chef actually took time to come out and discuss the options. The food was cooked to perfection with quality presentation. Combine this with the excellent service and this experience could not be faulted. We will be back and hoping for more of the same
2
Priced as an upper tier restaurant but the quality of the cooking isn't worth it. staff very pleasant but food too salty and not well cooked. The ravioli tasted like it had been kept in a fridge and warmed up. The octopus was too sweet. There are plenty Italian restaurants in Singapore that do way better, Feels like Burlamacco has gotten complacent
4
Food was tasty, with a generous portion. We had the beef tripe, seafood stew and the lobster linguine. All were tomato based with a tinge of spice. Just perfect for me. The wine was good too, just perfect to tame the spiciness of the taste bud. Environment was rowdy on a weekend night. So, was hard to talk
4
Did not have reservation and was still able to walk in at 6.30pm. Ordered the grilled octopus and really liked the chargrill taste and smell with balsamic vinegar. Finished every bite. Had the ragut with papadelle, sauce was fantastic but because the portion was quite big, my marginal utility was going down after 5 bites. Could have been better with some other ingredients like veggie or something instead of just sauce and pasta. Seafood stew was huge portion again and it was abit salty for me. But the stew was still tasty with rich seafood taste. I liked the tiramisu and the frozen souffle. Will come back and try other stuff.
4
Place is nicely and tastefully decorated. Staff and owner are attentive and friendly. Food was good. I was recommended to try the lobster linguine but I reserved it to a later date when I bring my wife along. This was a treat from my nephew and he also recommended the buratta cheese but it was too large a portion for lunch. So we gave it a miss too. I had the angel hair with the crab meat and tomato sauce. Was little spicy and tasted nice. Recommended too.
3
Family treated me here for my birthday dinner. We ordered several starters and mains and passed around the table of nine. Truffles fries is slightly less crunchy than expected. Burrata (with Parma)was creamy and silky. Other dishes of grilled octopus,spaghetti vongoles,squid ink risotto,rack of lamb,duck confit,squid ink seafood linguini, and profiterole were all good but not outstanding. Staffs were efficient and helpful. As I did not pay for my birthday dinner so I couldn't comment on the price value
5
Loved the burratta cheese with Parma ham. Bread served went well with it and tomatoes were super fresh
4
Their food was very wonderful as usual! I strongly recommend this restaurant for their consistent quality. I love their burrata cheese, braised beef short ribs, red tuna tartare & crab meat angel hair pasta
5
Lovely food. Very professional and attentive staff. Nice and friendly environment. Would very much recommend this place.
3
Visited after reading TA reviews. Food was fine, service attentive and ambience pleasant. But the cost was excessive. Two titamisus were 138 dollars! And they said the house wine was not available, so finished up with 80 dollar bottle.Admittedly only my second day in Singapore, so need to adjust my European values maybe.It was an enjoyable evening, spoilt by the 'over the top' prices
5
From the moment we arrived the waiting staff were very attentive. Gabriele, the owner and head chef is an outstanding, and spends a lot of time front of house, welcoming guests, explaining the food and wines and checking all is in order.We enjoyed the set Dinner menu with paired wines which was exceptional and my recommendation to everyone, although we have been previously and enjoyed the a la carte menu which also has fantastic options
4
Visited this restaurant recently , starter was well made and the potato fries were delightfully crisp (a sure treat , indeed).I also tried their pasta dish and it was reasonably up to mark.Overall , the experience, though nothing extraordinary or exceptional , left my appetite wholly satisfied
5
A referral from a Friend brought my Husband and I to the restaurant and we are so happy we tried it! The owner Gabriel is welcoming and exceptionally talented Chef. We have now been back numerous times with friends and work colleagues; referred others and there has not been one ounce of disappointment!The food is out of this world. The buratta with Parma ham and tomatoes is the best in Singapore. No contest.Every dish is a wonderous experience with my standout favourite being the slow cooked rib. It melts in your mouth and I would happily re-order it again and again! The black ink risotto with the gold leaf is to die for. Seriously, before this dish I was not a fan of black ink anything! In fact, I have tried many items on the menu with absolutely no regrets or order envy of my dining partners in crime. The wine list is great and if you are a fan of espresso martinis, then you must have one here! Don't forget to save room for the sweet part of the menu or cheese platter

I went on a date with my husband yesterday and was looking for an original yet small Italian restaurant.. We decided to try this place, nestled in a small and vibrant lane called Amoy street.But the vegetarian options were dismal. And the service was really poor. The food portions are very small , but were reasonably tasty. However, it's not just food, but ambience , service and choices that come as a package deal..It's not worth the visit in my opinion ... I'm giving them the three because the food was decent; but they didn't score on any other fron
5
A group of 10 of us dined here and we were blown away by the quality of the food. The carpaccio, tripe, tenderloin and Gorgonzola gnocchi were the best ever tasted by our Italian foodies who travel the world. The service was very attentive to start with and waned a little towards the end of our meal but apart form that we all came away saying "why go to Italy?" Wine list was also fair for Singapore prices. For fantastic Italian food at a fair price we highly recommend Burlamacco.
3
We had the 3eggs for appetizer which was ok. It was a nice hot dish for a rainy night but nothing impressive. Our mains were pappardelle with pork ragout which was good. Also gnocchi with mushroom cream which was a tad too heavy. And slow cooked ribs which wasn't as tender as I expected. Overall it was an average meal in terms of taste but made up for it value wise as portions were pretty generous for the pastas and meat
5
service was always a smile. food recommendations were good. staff were friendly with children which is a plus for me. lovely ambience as well. I'll be back!
5
excellent service and food! thanks all for providing the good experience
it is definately my great find in Telok Ayer.
5
Fantastic Italian restaurant serving creative and delicious cuisine. Had an excellent burrata to share between the 3 of us. Unbelievably good squid ink pasta. Nice and relaxed atmosphere. Lunch with coffee will take you 1 1/2 hour.
3
Started off the meal with lobster bisque which was too salty and watery. They were really thoughtful to have seperated into two portions as we were sharing.The 48hr braised beef was really soft and flavourful. It left us wanting more. The lobster linguine on the other hand was alright, juicy baby lobsters but mediocre sauce. We both felt that the portions were too small for the price that we were paying
5
I visited with a friend on a weekday night at around 7pm and the place was not too crowded. Service was great; bread and water were served quickly and promptly refilled during the meal. Staff were also friendly, occasionally checking in to see if everything was alright.The food was delicious. We shared two pastas - the pappardelle with pork leg ragout and angel hair pasta with crab meat. I really enjoyed both dishes. We also ordered the crostata (chocolate tart with vanilla ice-cream) for dessert and it was also very enjoyable.Would certainly be back for another visit

We started with the lobster bisque and thought to ourselves, uh oh, did we pick the wrong place? It was just too salty, and frankly, not thick enough for my liking. Next came our pastas. My pappardelle with pork leg ragout was divine! Not a lot of pork but the pappardelle was oh so fresh and soft, and the tomato/red wine sauce nice and subtle. Mum's pasta in arrabiatta sauce with lobster tail was also very good, with just the right amount of spice! We ended the meal with tiramisu. No wow factor here, but it was safe (it cost $18 but portion was huge). Service was polite, efficient and service staff and owner-chef came round making sure everything was ok.

The food was decent but we had to wait 45 minutes between our starters and mains. When the food finally arrived after repeated reminders there was not a word of apology or explanation of the delay. Go to this restaurant but bring a book and be prepared to have your evening ruined by poor service.

We enjoyed our dinner at Burlamacco and it was my second visit to the restaurant after organising a team dinner for work at this restaurant last year which also left me with a positive experience. Staff were quick and friendly, the owner also personally came out to serve and check on how we were going, just like any other staff member, food was good although slightly pricey. We had the Burrata, Angel hair pasta with crab meat in crab bisque, Beef short ribs and Cod Fish, as well as some desserts - the Pannacotta was the fav at our table. The restaurant has a nice ambience, not too noisy but not dead quiet. Definitely recommended for work dinners as well as catchups and birthday celebrations with friends.

Decided to end my restaurant week fantasia with Italian. The menu from Burlamacco Ristorante was perfect and to my liking-I must say that I was quite impressed by the appetizers-the pork belly and seabass carpaccio. Juicy and delicious for the pork, freshness and layers of flavors in the carpaccio. We ordered one of each for the main dish, the duck confit and pasta. Not gonna lie, I was there for the lobster tail linguine (yes always always the lobster), the pasta and sauce was beautifully cooked, I could taste sweetness in the broth, but was a tad disappointed that it wasn't exactly THE Boston lobster tail, it's a different breed of lobster from Boston (slipper lobster), and the "cream of the crop" was pretty small, it's fresh and tender, but a bit too small, regardless I prefer this over the duck. I've always had a soft spot for tiramisu but this time round, the overbaked chocolate crostata takes the cake! Overall, I was quite pleased with the dishes, and the prompt service, thumbs up for this restaurant week

Came here for lunch today with a colleague to sample the restaurant week menu at $40++ for 3 courses including tea or coffee. I opted for the beef carpaccio, the duck leg confit and the pannacotta, all of which were excellent. My colleague had the seafood salad, the fish and the fruit salad. Unfortunately her fish was a little dry but otherwise all was good. Coffee was reasonable but a nice touch would have been some 'coffee art', but perhaps this was missing given it was pretty full. Definitely worth a visit
5
Wonderful attentive but unobtrusive service, and absolutely fabulous food. Our first visit, but not our last.
5
Great food, service and good spot for a business lunch or evening meal. $33 for the 3 course set lunch is a winner
5
Excellent service despite an almost full house. Impeccable food as always.
My order of baked cod as fresh. My friends' squid ink pasta was giving me good envy.
5
came across this restaurant by chance. service is excellent, considering it was lunch time and there were 3 staff and the chef/owner, we did not have to wait too long for our food. the staff are attentive and the food simply delicious. we had the degustation menu and 3 other items from the ala carte menu. the items from the ala carte menu can be shared so you can actually order more stuff to try. it was our first visit and probably will return. the set lunch menu is affordable. I would recommend that you go there at 1130am when it is nice and quiet

Stepping into Burlamacco and being warmly ushered to your seats by the genial staff, promptly greeted by the affable Italian executive chef and owner, Gabriele Piegaia, you know you are in for some classic Italian charming hospitality. And of course, the food – fantastic, hearty Italian fare that exudes the soul of Italian cuisine, which is essentially superior produce prepared with the utmost passion.Tempting as it may be to try the Air-flown Burrata, we chose the Pan-roasted Buffalo Mozzarella wrapped in Parma Ham and were not disappointed. The natural saltiness of the ham perked up the creamily delicious mozzarella slices.And again, instead of going for the ubiquitous Crispy Calamari, we went for the Balsamic-grilled Octopus and again, we were rewarded with perfectly done tentacles, beautifully paired with fine green beans and orange.Lobster pasta normally tops the list of most pasta lovers, and here, it is executed so wonderfully, with sweet, succulent lobster tail in perfectly al dente pasta and in an arrabiata sauce that showcases just that tinge of spice – thanks to the singular chili padi that accompanies the dish.The 48-hour slow-cooked Beef Short Ribs, meanwhile, is the classically perfect example of how this dish should be – fork-tender juicy meat, braised in Marsala wine that lends rich, robust flavours to this hearty dish. This is one dish worth repeatedly visiting the restaurant for.Desserts to round of the night should include the decadent Crostata – a dark-as-night chocolate tart erupting with gooey chocolate.Naturally, enjoy some very good vino with a reasonably-priced range of mainly Italian labels, and look forward to some home-made Limoncello at the end of the meal.Also, good to note that they have corkage-free days on Tuesdays and Sundays, so BYO your favourite bottle of vino and enjoy the night away

There's a lot of great things to say about this place. #1, food and drinks(cocktail) are superb. From appetizer-main-dessert, everything we've tried is really tasty! Price wise i'd also say is decent. Staffs are very friendly. Service is fast. Ambiance is another thing i love. Simple and very homey. Music is just at its proper volume to allow conversation between diners. Also, Burlamacco is very accessible. The nearest mrt station is Tanjong Pagar, exit G. From this exit, i'd say less than 5mins walk to get to the resto. Not but not the least, on Tuesdays & Sundays, you can bring your own wine. So for diners who have very nice wine at home and would like to enjoy it at Burlamacco, well guess what, you can!!! In fact, you are very much encourage to do so. No charge or anything for the wine that you bring. It's as simple as bring your own and enjoy it there ;) Like what i said, there's nothing not to like about this place. Btw, they do accept reservations, too

You must try the mozzarella dish as an appetizer! I cannot stop thinking about how delicious it was! For our main dish we had the ink risotto and the angel hair crab pasta. The ink risotto was amazing! Having a blob of blackness on your plate is interesting but it is to die for! The angel hair pasta was good but not spectacular compared to the risotto and our appetizer. The waiter was amazing and very helpful! The venue is quite cute the only downfall is that there seems to be too many tables... We could hear everyone talking and it gets quite loud. Overall I will definitely go back! You must go there!!!
5
Almost everything on the menu is delicious, and well executed. The wait staff are well versed with what the restaurant offers, and make great recommendations to showcase what the restaurant can produce. Pity they did not have the tomahawk the day I visited, and will certainly go back to try it sometime soon. It is a great place for great food in a very relaxed atmosphere. If only the corkage was a bit lower...

This was a return visit on the evening of September 6 after I had brought my mum to celebrate her birthday a month ago. The food was excellent (fuss-free, "solid" pastas); however, we witnessed the ultimate juxtaposition of top notch service with its complete opposite from the two servers. I didn't get their names so all I can say is that the male server was friendly and attentive — he brought out a birthday dessert on the house without us having asked for one, as he learnt that it was my birthday when one of my friends presented me with a gift — whereas his female colleague was curt and dismissive. Whenever we tried to get her attention, she would glare at us and say "Wait, I'll come back" — that would've been fine if she had actually stayed true to those words, but she failed to come back or follow up on a prior request three out of four times. A word of advice to management is to remember that service really does play a huge part in your diners' experience. I'll give the female server the benefit of the doubt and acknowledge that she might have had a bad day, but if other diners have had experiences similar to mine, I hope that management either sits down with her to conduct a performance review or replaces her with someone more like her colleague. Having said all that, I'd definitely recommend Burlamacco for anyone who is looking for an Italian restaurant that is consistent and reasonably priced. It's perfect for all occasions ranging from dates to family celebrations and mid-sized group meals

I was invited here for lunch and found that my friends had ordered my meal for me; a seafood squid ink fettucine with seafood, Angus tomohawk steak and truffled fries shared between the 3 of us with a semifreddo each for dessert.Food was well prepared and very tasty indeed. All the courses arrived beautifully plated. The gravy from the pasta was made for mopping up with the bread. The huge steak was done perfectly with the right amount of crisp on the outside and rare on the inside.The semifreddo accompanied by the house made limoncello ended a very satisfying meal.Excellent attentive service throughout. I have been converted and will be coming back
5
We had their lobster linguine, which was really good. The service staff was very attentive and considerate. He actually took the initiative to split our starter into 2 plates since we were sharing. I will definitely come again.
5
Wonderful and delicious meal. The portions were generous and the service was attentive without being overly so. We received excellent recommendations on wine. But the food was so tasty. Judging by the full restaurant we were not the first people to discover this.
5
Food is wonderful and service is always friendly and personable. Grill Fish with Seafood was absolutely delish! I had 2 servings of Baby Spinach Salad :p Chocolate Tart is a must try and do not attempt to share :p
4
Always enjoy the Buratta Cheese, Papadella with Wild Boar Ragout, Vongole Spagetti with lots of fresh garlic & slice chilli plus the staff friendly service too
4
We loved the personalized service with the owner/chef customizing our order based on our requirements (we're vegetarians). The food was excellent!
3
The lobster linguine was the pasta of the month so was $24++ instead of the usual $32++ so two of us ordered it. The other two are vegetarians so they had a vegetarian aglio olio pasta. We felt the lobster linguine was on the salty side. My friend thought the lobster was slightly overcooked and had a rubbery texture but I was ok with mine. A very tasty dish that I would order again but I would give instructions for less salt.

Maybe it was because it was a lunchtime but my experience with my husband and niece who met me for lunch at this restaurant was terrible. We were there for over an hour and only received bread buns (even that was after 15 minutes and we had to ask). We ordered from the three course set lunch to save time (Spaghetti Ragu which shouldn't take long to make anyway). My husband ordered the white bait starter and seconds into it found a hair which was clearly none of ours - perhaps the waitress should wear her hair tied back. My husband sent it back. We approached 1 hour 10 mins and my lunch hour was rapidly running out it and there was still no sign of food. Understandably we were waiting for our meals to arrive with baited breath by then and kept an eye on the kitchen door. It was then we saw what we assumed to be the Head Waiter/Manager tucking into a plate of food, while we were still actually waiting for ours. He came out and told us our food would be here shortly. Another 5 minutes went by and by this point I knew I would not have time to eat the main course and then wait for desert to arrive. It is also worth noting that during our time in the restaurant all of the staff had a very snooty attitude. Whether they assumed we were tourists because my husband and niece were in casual clothes, and therefore decided we didn't need proper treatment, I don't know. Actually it is quite the opposite, we both work for large corporate companies near by and rest assured we will be telling colleagues of our experience. After 1 hour 10 minutes we finally decided we needed to leave, no food had arrived and it wasn't like we were enjoying the whole experience anyway. We complained to the Manager and told him we were leaving and he had the cheek to argue with us and say it was because we took a long time to order. Maybe if the staff had been a bit more attentive we could have ordered sooner. That being said, how much time does it take to cook Spaghetti Beef Ragu? We offered to pay for the bottle of sparkling water we consumed and we were charged for this. Really? After finding a hair in our food, waiting for over an hour for a set lunch menu (in a restaurant only a quarter full) and the Head Waiter arguing that it was our fault for taking so long to order, I think a free bottle of sparkling water was the least we deserved. Safe to say we left, won't be going back and while my husband and niece (who had a day off work) could go and get some lunch from somewhere else, I had to return to work HUNGRY
5
Even though we arrived early, we were invited in by the Chef/Owner for an Iralian beer. The restaurant has a relaxed and friendly vibe to it, with excellent friendly service. The mussels starter was top quality with a sauce that required more bread, as you wouldn't want to leave any on the dish. The Chef adds pollenta flower to the outside of the foie gras before cooking, the texture magnifies the flavour on your tongue. If you like foie gras you have to try this. All the food served was of a very high quality, the wine was very tasty and affordable to have a number of bottles. Don't leave without having at least one glass of their homemade Lemoncello (Italian lemon liqueur), better than any Bottled Lemoncello that you will have tasted before. We had a great night and will definitely be returning. Thank you

Came here for the AMEX 50% off deal. Ordered the grilled mozzarella, fries and two pastas to share. Service is attentive and quite pleasant. Food was OK, nothing memorable. Pasta was under seasoned, too much cream sauce. Seemed like a good date restaurant, saw plenty of couples. No overwhelming reason to go back, you definitely end up paying for the location
5
Celebrated the hubby's birthday in this fantastic restaurant! Made a very silly booking for 12 people at 6pm when the restaurant only opens at 630pm and they assured me they would be ready by 6pm just for us! Great service. Everyone was super attentive but not overcrowding! Food was fantastic and desserts were great! Special thanks to Gabriele who was super prompt in all the email responses! Very very impressed with this restaurant! Thanks for making the celebration a memorable one
4
Excellent meal where i particularly enjoyed the lamb chops and squid ink rissoto. Service was professional and knowledgeable. Enjoyed the evening thoroughly.
5
Having spent the night with 8 other friends -- the restaurant has a very nice atmosphere for chatting. Servers were very knowledgeable and courteous. Food was superb and cooked perfectly!
5
I going to Burlamacco as I like the Trippa. Also the Cacciucco is a dish to try.
Ambience is comfortable and warm, service attentive and discret.
I like Burlamacco.
5
Have been to this restaurants on numerous occasions but this one was "special"....The tomahawk steak was absolutely delicious as was the prawn and black ink pasta. This wasn't on the menu but the chef was kind to do a special order for me!!Creamy and Spicy. Wonderful!! Planning another pig-out next week!
5
Not a bigvlover of itlaian as I find Singapore is too full of Italian food that tries too hard. Difference her is that there is attention to detail in the dishes and the quality is great, Very good service and considerate of our requests. Kept our wine topped up with no hassle or interference
3
After ordering the Linguine with Boston Lobster Tail in Spicy “Arrabbiata” Sauce it was disappointing that there was absolutely no spice. When the chef was asked "what happened to spicy?" he shrugged his shoulders and offered no explanation. Pretty disappointing considering he is the owner. The service staff apologised but seriously - don't label the spicy "Arrabbiata" if it's just tomato, because if the owner doesn't care, who does? An apology would have been an easy fix. Won't go again

There were many things I really liked. The decor, ambiance, lighting were great. The service was also great--our waitress was polite, attentive, and efficient. We had the fried calamari appetizer which was excellent: the calamari was fresh and not rubbery and the batter was crisp and tasty while the red sauce for dipping was wonderful and savory. The bread offered was also great. But we all ordered pasta for our main and were a bit disappointed--two of us had the gnocchi, I had the pappardelle and lastly there was the angel hair. The pasta itself was fresh, tasty and perfectly cooked. However I thought none of the sauces was really that great. It wasn't like they were somehow cooked with inferior ingredients or some mistake was made. I just didn't think they were that tasty. I don't know, maybe I'm just an idiot who doesn't know Italian food, but I do eat a lot of it and I know what I like and what I don't. I loved their use of the colors decorating the desert plates--follows nicely with the Burlamacco name--clever and beautiful
4
solid food. waiter was knowledgeable and helped lots with menu selections and organisations as we wanted to let everybody try everything. Do try the meat platter, the prosciutto wrapped pork tenderloin was an absolute delight, the mushroom sauce bringing out the sweetness of the tender meat. the burrata is a must try, melts in your mouth but not on the plate, served with well ripened but not overly soft tomatoes
4
Had a business lunch here. Ambience is very pleasant with cool modern decor. Service was good and attentive. We took the three course business lunch for SGD 30. There were good choices although slightly mean that you can have either coffee or dessert. Pork belly starter was excellent with a delicious sauce. I would return
3
First time experience so so. I have decided not to returned actually. but this time round my companion wanted to go, so I relented. Give it a second chance. Unfortunately, it still dissapoints.Food is average and not well presented. Service is inconsistent and looks like the waiters have 'friends' visiting. Ambience - a little noisy and not enough privacy. Price - it is overpriced.Won't come back
4
I came to Burlamacco 2 times already and was never let down. Ambiance was good, waiters were friendly, food was good. I give it full marks!
5
my friends and I had a great time at Burlamacco. Everything from food to service to ambience in the charming restaurant was excellent. We would recommend this to everyone.
4
Lovely Italian in the CBD, attentive and informative staff. Scores of delicious meals to chose in the future but would highly recommend the seafood stew!

Attracted by the Restaurant Week lunch offer, I paid them a visit with my family on Sunday afternoon. Service from the staff was very good, and they showed good knowledge of the menu and offerings. However, my entire family couldn't help but notice the strong smell of tobacco or cigarettes emanating from a male service staff as he stood by our table whilst explaining the menu. It was frankly quite overpowering and the restaurant really needs to look into this.Another letdown was the cutlery. 2 spoons at our table weren't properly cleaned, as food stains were still evident. Not sure why this wasn't picked up by the staff when they set the tables.Aside from the 2 issues above, the food was rather tasty, and the set menu for Restaurant Week was definitely value for money. Apparently the foie gras was so good that they sold out the night before, hence none was available for lunch when we visited
5
I was there for Restaurant Week with my friends but unfortunately could not join in the eating because of a recent wisdom tooth operation. One of their waiters then surprised me with a dish with something softer for me to manage. He said that he wanted me to have something so I could eat together with my friends. It was a simple but very delicious egg and tomato dish. The gesture was kind and considerate. Impressive service! My friends mentioned that what they had ordered was good as well. Will be returning to try their other offerings.
5
This was our 2nd visit to Burlamacco and we returned because our first experience was pleasant. We got ourselves a bottle of Barolo which was decently priced and good. For food we started off by ordering their air-flown burrata, certainly the most expensive I've come across in Singapore. My wife who by no means is a cheese/burrata connoisseur but has taken a liking to burratas and said that this was superb and well worth the price. We also ordered their spinach salad to get things going. For mains we got pappardelle with pork ragout, oven-roasted cod fish, beef short ribs and a vegetarian arabiatta pasta. All dishes were great and complimented each other. The pasta was good with the wine sauce, the fish was flavourful and the beef ribs were tender. By mistake the maitre d' took our order incorrectly and ended up bringing a spring chicken to our table - he offered us the dish for free meanwhile ensuring that the kitchen cooks the correct dish at the fastest.For desserts we got a tiramisu and a crostata (a tart oozing molten chocolate) with ice-cream. The tiramisu was good, but the crostata was out of the world - my new Italian favourite. The staff was very courteous and on top of things, filled our glasses when empty, took away plates when we were done and the maitre d' was engaging. Certainly must visit; we'll be going back again
4
A nice place for a business lunch not far from the office where we had a meeting.Authentic Italian fare without great pretension but tasty and fresh. Service was good and fast.A nice ending to the meal(although we had to go back to work) was the home made Lemoncello left on the table in a large 2 or 3 liters bottle. I guess it is perfect for an after dinner drink
4
Located in an area of old restored shophouses near Chinatown and the Shenton Way financial area, the restaurant has a charming ambience and decor inside. We had the Christmas festive set dinner - very nice pasta and duck confit ! Alacarte menu has a good variety of classic Italian dishes, some are slightly modified for Singapore, - reasonable prices and very tasty food indeed. Service is friendly and with a sense of humour. Enjoyed it very much 
5
Warm, cosy and pleasantly lively ambiance to the restaurant. Ticks all the boxesHead chef is very inter active with the customers.....constantly floor walking and checking in with the clientele.Staff are very efficient and very attentive. Uncommon in many places in Singapore.The maÃ®tre d' is also on top of his game. Not only competent with his knowledge of wines but also of the food menu.Menu is changed regularly and the often have '' specials'' that are not on thereIn fact invariably the head chef experiments with dishes and asks us to try them out for future menus.Pasta's come in a variety of selections and cooked VERY well.Meat and fish dishes have always been of good quality.And all dishes regardless will be made to you individual preference should you so wish.Pretty decent wine selection too.One of the best things about this place is they don't rush you with your food and you can stay as long as you want in the restaurant....none of this '' we are closing in 10 minutes please leave''Highly recommend for all occasions... couples...business meals..and groups.We will always regularly re visi
5
Actually the whole meal was amazing. This restaurant have set meals for every festive season. The food tend to carry flavors that explode in your mouth.It is a definite must go...I am going again because I cannot get the foie gras out of my head
4
Excellent food paired with excellent service, didnt have any room left to try dessert unfortunately. I'm pregnant but the waiter/host knew exactly what I could or couldnt eat. Pretty amazing. He also timed the serving of main course, wine, coffee, etc perfectly.
4
True italian in the heart of Chinatown. Run by an italian, prepared by an italian and eaten by an italian what more could you want. This is a truly gastronomic delight with friendly service and good wine choices. Well worth a visit
4
food was great with nice portions.we ordered 1 set meal & 1 ala carte menu.recommended linguine with lobster
4
Truly enjoyed the food and the attentive service. Consistent quality all the occasions we were there.
4
I like that it's not over crowded, service is good and food value for money (I've only tried their set lunches). Love the truffle fries, black squid ink risotto and lobster tail linguine are really good. Desserts are very good delicious too - yummy panna cotta & chocolate tart

Burlamacco is 2! I saw a 2nd anniversary email from the restaurant and went by last weekend. The restaurant is located along Amoy Street, near Tanjong Pagar is a conserved shophouse. It has modern interiors and is nicely appointed with huge paintings of modern art portraits. It also has a walk in glass cellar with a wide variety of wines to choose from. Here are the highlights of my meal:1) Parma Ham wrapped around Griscini Stick: A savoury lollipop, with the parma ham wrapped around a biscuit stick. You can’t stop at one, for sure.2) Smoked Salmon with Baked Cracker topped with sour cream and caviar: Very good. The sour cream and caviar complimented the smoked salmon well.3) Hand Chopped Tuna Tartare served with Avocado: Unlike tuna tartare I ate elsewhere which is more finely chopped, this was roughly chopped into 5cm pieces and seasoned. Topped with avocado pieces, it was good. Recommended!4) Squid Ink Risotto: As black as a night’s sky, the risotto was simply served on a white plate. The photo I took doesn’t do justice to the taste and flavour of the dish. It was simple and often the simplest dishes are the hardest to do. Couldn’t get enough of the dish. It was good!5) 48 hour Sous Vide Braised Beef Short Rib: The beef was very tasty and flavourful, thanks to the 48 hour cooking period. Tender and comes apart easily when cut. The mash potato was also good and the beef jus was delicious.6) Warm Valrhona Chocolate Tart with Vanilla Ice Cream: Think warm molten lava chocolate cake, and this was what came to my mind. The same ingredients are used to fill the tart shell. Topped with vanilla ice cream, it was a great dessert to end the meal. Must-order! The food I had are signature dishes of the restaurant and I can see why they are popular. A good place for Italian cuisine. Try it

Decided to visit the restaurant since it was restaurant week. Went on a Saturday evening at about 6:30pm. It was not too crowded.Was welcomed by a not that friendly staff, whom I believe was the front of house. He didn't seem to sound understand about us turning up as 3 guests instead of 4 when we made our reservations. That aside, our main waiter was excellent and made us right at home. Restaurant was on the dark side however, so taking pictures inside would definitely require a flash.My friends and I shared the dishes (shown in the pictures). We ordered some other dishes as well. All of the dishes were generally good. The short ribs were very nice. Dessert was perhaps the weakest amongst the three courses. Enjoyed the ravioli that came with a nice rich garlicky flavour. The entire 3 course meal was $55++ since it was restaurant week. It was nice, though I would have expected better from this place. Pleasant experience but not great enough for me to want to come back
5
Had dinner at Burlamacco this past Saturday with 2 other Survival Chic Members... we all shared appetisers (the burratta was to-die-for, and the tuna tartare our 2nd-favorite)... then most of the group went with pastas, while I chose the steak - all totally delicious! We washed it down with prosecco, followed by a couple of bottles of a nice Italian red recommended the Burlamacco team. The nicest part was that Chef Gabriele, as well as the knowledgeable Manager, were both extremely friendly and attentive, coming out several times to check on our table, help us with recommendations, and make sure everything was perfect - very rare occurrence in Singapore! We used the Survival Chic card of one of the Members and saved $186 ;). Had planned to get dessert, but were simply too full - and satisfied. Next time!

Burlamacco is a hidden gem in the midst of Korean restaurants in Tanjong Pagar. I like the fact that Burlamacco has a classy Italian ristorante vibe yet it still gives you a casual atmosphere. It's perfect to go out on dates or just a hearty dinner with family or friends. The service was great, friendly and helpful waiters who suggested my friend and I not to order too much food. He certainly helped us curbing our uncontrollable foodie goddess. Now, let's get down to business and talk about the food :)Must order: Buratta with parma ham and Lobster Linguine.Buratta with parma ham/ prosciutto is always my favorite antipasti but not many places make a good buratta. What's a good buratta? Oeey-gooey, creamy, cheesy and fresh buratta. Yes, the kind that melts in your mouth. Eat it with parma ham and oh boy, it's so good.Lobster Linguine is also my favorite pasta and Burlamacco certainly did a great job. The linguine was al dente and the sauce is perfect. On top of that, the lobster was well cooked that you can taste the juicy and sweet lobster. Yes, that's why it's your must order.The other dish that I tried was the Carpaccio with truffle. I think the title speaks for itself. Yes, yummy! All these comes with a medium range price and if you want to treat yourself to a nice Italian restaurant, this is it

Burlamacco comes to mind whenever the husband and I crave Italian. We have been here a few times and the food and service has always maintained its excellence and efficiency. Owner and Head Chef Gabriele provides his customers with a personable hospitality that is found lacking in many restaurants in Singapore. On our most recent visit, we were greeted warmly as usual by the staff. We decided upon the Stewed beef tripe with vegetables, tomato and parmesan cheese and the balsamic grilled octopus tentacles with beans and oranges for starters. Though not a fan of animal innards, I was pleasantly surprised by how flavourful the beef tripe was in its creamy and cheesy sauce. The blend was just lovely and this dish had changed my mind about how innards can be cooked just as beautifully. I love grilled octopus and this one definitely did not disappoint. It was extremely fresh and seasoned just nicely with a delicate flavour of citrus. Both of us chose the handmade pasta as.our mains, the ravioli with porcini mushroom cream sauce and the trofie with tomato sauce and mozarella cheese. As porcini mushrooms are a favourite, this dish already scored points before tasting! Nevertheless, it was done tastefully and the amount of ricotta cheese stuffed in the ravioli was very generous. If you love anything cheesy and creamy this is for sure the dish to try! The trofie was cooked simply but was just as delicious. Fresh handmade pasta definitely tastes positively different! Kudos to the Chef! For wine aficionados, you will not be disappointed with Burlamacco's extensive wine selection, which can be paired nicely with their main courses. By the time we had finished out pastas, we were too stuffed to go on to desserts. Will definitely go back again to try their chocolate tart which we have heard many people rave about! Burlamacco Ristorante- Always a praiseworthy dining experience at affordable prices
5
I highly recommend ,, No doubt the best italian restaurant in singapore.
Great food,service and outstanding wine selection.
4
Went few times to this place with colleagues and friends. Food is really good as well as the service.
Worth going there for a nice Italian experience.
5
Burlamacco offers classic Italian meals in the medium price range. The Chef, Gabriele runs and manages every aspect of the restaurant, giving his unique personal touch to everything, resulting in exquisite meals and a brilliantly personalised service, all in a cosy shophouse setting. The homemade pasta is superb and at the end you have to leave space for a real gelat

Monday night dinner after work - quiet atmosphere, cosy warm lighting and ambience, moderate crowd of diners, well-attended by 2 waiters. They were attentive and friendly. Able to recommend the best dishes. We enjoyed their signature lobster linguine, burrata cheese with parma ham, rack of lamb, and chocolate profiteroles - good experience 
3
The lobster linguine was well spiced, I would order it again! The pork ragout tagliatelle was also very good. Prices at 30+ and 20+. However, the sides and desserts I feel are not value for money.We couldnt taste the rum in the tiramisu. Semifreddo (half frozen soffle) didn't impress- tastes just like cream wrapped in chocolate. Service alright- maybe a tad overly friendly in a bad way. Sorry I can't describe properly. Not professional as compared to some other places.Bread came, just olive oil in a saucer. Had to ask for butter and balsamic
5
We visited this restaurant some months ago and enjoyed it, so re-visited, for our anniversary.We were not disappointed.The food was great and the service even better. Our waiter even anticipated our needs and had asked the kitchen for the Burrata Cheese and Parma before we ordered!The Burrata is seriously good and more than enough for two. Creamy, fresh, delicious.My wife had the Foie Gras for her main and found it delicious but a little rich for her taste.I had the beef short ribs and they were juicy and delicious and perfectly seasoned.The "Crostata" was a rich, chocolatey way to finish and we were then pleasantly surprised with a complimentary Tiramisu, as the restaurant knew it was our anniversary.A great night out, with delicious food, faultless, friendly and swift service.We'll be back

We arrived at the restaurant without a reservation but managed to get a seat in the middle of the dining area. Unfortunately my friend and I were seated directly under an air conditioner, which was giving away a strong draft. We asked if we could be move to another table but were informed that all the tables were fully booked. After enquiring whether they could re-direct / lower the fan speed (as this was not centralized air-conditioning) we were actually told by one of the staff that if we were not willing to put up with it we can just leave because they are fully booked anyway. It was more of the tone and the delivery of their response that upset us. It was said in a very arrogant and demeaning way. I do commend one of the other waiters who offered my friend a shawl to use however this was not enough to salvage the situation and we instantly left before even ordering. I have never written a review of a restaurant on any restaurant webpage / food blog and believe me there are plenty of incidents, especially in Singapore, where I have come across appalling service but this by far the worse treatment I have ever received whilst dining. Good service should be the norm and not the exception. Come on Singapore, we deserve better! We should stop patronizing such establishments

It's our default restaurant for special occasions for my partner and myself. We love the food, the tuna carpaccio with avocado is a must try. On different occasions we have had the fish and tenderloin and both are stellar. I am not much of a pasta fan but my partner who is German / Italian loves it. The chocolate tart is amazing - that is if you still have room to have this after going through the other items on the degustation menu. On our last visit, the owner made my day when he came around to ask how the meal was and my partner explained how I was slightly disappointed as I didn't manage to get a particular dish (I was so looking forward to) as it was no longer on the degustation menu. The owner went back to the kitchen and produced it with my next course. This personalized service just sets this restaurant apart from many others!

Loving this Italian restaurant on Telok Ayer street in Singapore. Great service, lovely ambience, greta value degustation including lots of top ups of wine or a great selection on the ala carte.Tasty meals for meat eaters and vegeterians alike. Allround great place for lunch and dinner.Well recommended

Italian restaurants can be found in the four corners of the world. In Singapore there are many options. Here at Burlamacco the chef and staff go that bit extra to provide a personal touch, starting with the chef greeting you at the table. Chef Gabriele also helps serve the dishes to you.The food was excellent - and you can taste that fresh ingredients are used. My wife and I shared all our food, which is the Asian way. The attentive waiter picked up on this and offered to split the two main courses we ordered so we got to try a bit of each. A very nice touch.We tried the mussel in tomato sauce which was really nice; but this was surpassed by the Linguine with Lobster tail. This was deliciously set with an Arriabata sauce that, was subtle with the spice. All cooked freshly including the pasta. We also had a lovely rack of lamb, which like the Lobster tail was split for us to share on separate plates, The lamb was really tasty and cooked to perfection. I measure the quality of restaurants in Singapore on the way they serve their lamb chops, I have had some disappointments, But the lamb at Burlamacco is excellent,For dessert my wife had Tiramisu and I had the cheese selection, which included a lovely goats cheese (I usually am not a fan of goats cheese, but this one was the best cheese served). Be warned the cheese board is a large selection ! My wife reported the Tiramisu was one of her favourites. Too compliment the lamb I was recommeneded by the waiter a lovely bottle of Valpolicella. Corte Sant Alda 2012, which for Singapore standards was reasonably priced. Too finish I tried chef's homemade Limoncello - which was fantastic neither too sweet nor too sour. There are so many run of the mill Italian restaurants - this one stands out

This has a cosy feel to it.The slightly limited menu seems to mean it is all freshly cooked.The lobster linguine with a spicy sauce was outstanding.the service was attentive and friendly.i will certainly return if only for that memorable linguine!
5
Service is charming, food is incredible and price is very reasonable.
Would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who is craving some good italian food in Singapore. It's hard to find a good one in Singapore.

Great food. Great chef. Fantastic authentic cuisine. Always nice to discover a new place on Singapore. Service is excellent.

Went to Burlamacco based on Tripadvisor revues. The service was good and the place filled up pretty fast. Bookings would be essential. We settled for the 3 course $55 menu. The food was well presented although the servings were small. The service was faultless but the food won't knock your socks off
5
Came in for 1 day from Jakarta and even though they were booked up, we got an early 6 pm dinner spot. It was one of the prix fixe nights so 2 of us had the set menu and 2 from a la carte. Staff very knowledgeable and the food was tasty indeed. Had short ribs, fish and while the plate looked a bit sparse when the meal came, it was all delightfully filling. They even let us stay a bit longer than initially agreed upon. Looking forward to returning again

I was privileged to be invited to a private Birthday function in Bulamarco Restaurant. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the food was superb and in great abundance. The friendliness of the staff and service was flawless. The ambience of the place was very pleasant and comfortable and a great place for a party. I would recommend this restaurant to all my friends. A must to try while in Singapore. Wendy Anderson

I found this restaurant on Hungry Go Where and we had a wonderful meal for the family. The squid ink risotto was perfect as was the lobster pasta which my son who is a seafood pasta afficionado absolutely loved. The chef came out and thanked us. All in all a wonderful experienc

My friends and I popped by Burlamacco last evening to have our Christmas dinner before everyone heads off for the Christmas holidays. The first thing that struck me was the warm cozy ambiance of the place, it instanly made me feel at home. Service was top notch throughout the night, all the staff there were very polite and helpful, quite a rarity indeed here in Singapore. Now on to the food! For starters, we had the spinach salad, chopped tuna and parma ham to share. The chopped tuna was recommended to us as it is the restaurant's star dish. The starters were decent, but it was the main dishes that wowed us. We had the short beef ribs, beef tenderloin, and lobster pasta. All three were delicious, perfectly cooked! As for dessert, the chocolate eruption, panna cotta and tiramisu were sweet endings to an awesome meal. We were even served home made limencello after our dessert. The limencello served was created in house, and it was certainly a refreshing change from the standard limencello served in other Italian restaurants. All in all it was a great and enjoyable evening at this restaurant. Price wise it is a little above average but it is certainly worth it if you take into consideration the quality of the food and the top notch service. We all agreed that this is one place we will definitely return to very soon
5
You will find a friendly kiss on the cheek (especially if you're a lady), a warm handshake, an excellent wine list and one of the best dining experiences to be had in Singapore if you are looking for genuine Tuscan cuisine and an address that you can and will call on for many repeat occasions

I went there with another friend of mine from overseas for dinner. Location is not bad, but the ambiance from outside is not so fantastic compared to others in the market. We started off with some burratta - one of the best I have tried. For main we both wanted to try Spaghetti with lobster and veal chop cooked Milanese style. Kindly enough, the waiter suggested 3 course menu with the dishes we selected. We think overall dishes are nice but restaurant needs more time to make it to great. Host who brought us was not charming, restaurant seems to be noisy especially with the footsteps noise made by the waiters. This really bothered me. I will visit again but not so soon
5
Found that place after a long at a travel fair. Great food, friendly chef. We asked him to choose the menu for us and it was my best experience in Singapore. Will be back!

This was our first trip to Burlamacco, but it will definitely not be our last. We took advantage of Singapore Restaurant Week to sample this Italian in the CBD, which we had not previously heard about, and we are very glad that we did. My first course was the pan-fried buffalo mozzarella wrapped in parma ham, while my companion chose the tender octopus tentacles served with fine beans. The tentacles were small and indeed tender, although the way the dish was served (constructed in a ring mould, with the components mixed together), made the beans rather difficult to identify. My starter was delicious, although I would have liked the parma ham to be crispier. Presentation of both dishes was refined and elegant. The chef - Gabriele - visited our table during the second course, and seemed genuinely interested in our thoughts about the restaurant and the food. My companion had chosen the short ribs, which he pronounced "delicious - tender and succulent" and I had the lobster with squid ink spaghetti. The sauce was truly, deeply black and I was not sure I was going to love it, but it was delicious. It tasted of the sea and was thick enough to coat the pasta without being too cloying. The helping of lobster could have been slightly more generous, but that is a minor quibble in a menu that was very well priced to take account of restaurant week. Dessert was semifreddo, in a chocolate wrapper with caramelised almonds on the side. It was a delicious end to the meal; just enough to finish things off, but not so much as to overpower the memory of the flavours of the rest of the meal. One of the nice touches by Burlamacco was to make a selection of wines available, both by the glass and the bottle, at special restaurant week prices. We began with a glass of Prosecco for the bargain price of 6 Singapore dollars and chose a Chianti to accompany dinner. It was a perfectly acceptable drop for just under 50 dollars, but of course the main wine list contains some fabulous Italian wines, at prices to match.Burlamacco offers a variety of dining opinions, from a set price lunch during the week to a degustation menu with optional wine pairing. There is something for every discerning palate with a fondness for Italian food. Italian food

Whilst I am loathed to give away the secret, I really have to be honest and say this is my new favourite Italian ! I have eaten here many times now for business lunches, social occasions, and the Sunday brunch and every time I have left happy and full.The food is beautifully presented, and the authentic Italian menu is mouth watering. The exec set lunch is a bargain and has options for all tastes. The Sunday brunch is amazing value, all dishes served to the table and ask for more of what you want.Burlamacco will do well in this highly competitive market, which is down to good service, excellent food and a great location. Can't wait to go back!

Have been to Burlamacco a few times and have always left feeling good about the meal. Portions are good, staff are friendly. Gabriele and Paolo make a great team.Following dishes have never failed - The burratta cheese with tomatoes & prosciutto, chopped tuna with avacado and tripe are excellent.Must tries for main course are the rack of lamb and pastas. Go with a few friends and share
4
Went for dinner with some friends. As it was a Monday night, the restaurant was not crowded and service was excellent - friendly, helpful and attentive. We started off with some prosciutto and burratta - absolutely delicious. Ditto the chopped tuna with avocado and the tripe. The main courses of pasta puttanesca, briased beef short ribs and veal chop cooked Milanese style were well cooked and presented. The desserts and expresso to follow made for a good ending. Everything was competently executed. However, something, which I couldn't put my finger on, was missing and I didn't leave as satisfied as I should have after a good meal - which this was. Will have to go back again to figure out what was the 'X-factor" that was missing
4
Good food, great service . Menu not massive but quite varied , we had foie gras , tripe and mussels for starters ,all excellent. Mains included risotto , ribs , steak. All nice size portions and also very good. Only the price of the wine let the evening down , cheapest bottle started at about 90 dollars
5
Everything was perfect. Excellent food, great service and nice surroundings.We ran through a broad selection of the menu. The starters were the steamed mussels with tomato and the octopus with a bean salad both perfectly cooked and very tasty. Then we split the rigatoni with the rabbit ragout. Again well seasoned and the pasta cooked perfectly.For the mains we had the seafood cacciucco, a fish stew with tomato that is very reminicent of the cioppino in San Francisco. It was wonderful, then the rack of lamb, perfectly cooked with a nice touch of rosemary and garlic.We finished with the tiramisu and pannacotta, both well done with little accents to keep them interesting. There were some well chosen wines by the glass and wine list for bottles was well chosen and fairly priced. Throughout the meal the service was attentive and the staff knowlegable and friendly. I am looking forward to visiting again
5
I've been to Burlamacco twice for their set lunch and both times, I was never disappointed by their menu because they regularly change their selection of anti-pasti, mains and dessert, this means that you will never be stuck with the same set lunch choices all year round! In my recent visit, I had the beef carpaccio with black truffle puree for my antipasto, and boy am I glad I picked this! I am so in love with this starter, I wished I could have triple the servings! When it comes to fish, I am quite the fussy eater, and usually I end up skipping the fish skin or not finishing at all... Well, I was thrilled with my choice of the roasted seabass - the fish is very fresh and simply melted in my mouth! The roasted skin was so flavourful that I cleared my entire plate clean! Period!!I enjoyed dining at Burlamacco not just for their food, but for the ambience and their warm hospitality. It's such a cozy setup with Paolo and Chef Gabriele never failing to come round each table to ensure that every patron is enjoying his/her meal. I must compliment the servers for their quick and tip-top service!I'll definitely be back
5
The 3-course executive set lunch was great value for money. Every course was perfectly presented and you can tell that chef Gabriele takes great pride in his food. The crab bisque was a great appetizer to kickstart our meal, and it kept me wanting for more! I had the Arrabbiata in spicy tomato sauce for my main course and it was delightful. The dish was flavourful, yet light enough for me to lick clean the entire plate! And the dessert, I am salivating as I write this now - the chocolate crostata with vanilla ice cream - was fantastic. Chocolate lovers will love this and it definitely was a perfect end to our lunch.Pay a visit to this gem of a restaurant tucked along Amoy street - you'll be infected by the warmth and friendliness of the waiters and I am sure it will be a very enjoyable experience. I will definitely be back! :)

Burlamacco is a little gem, hidden in Amoy street. From the first minutes you walk in and till the end you feel like you are in one of those small charming restaurants in Italy. Food is fantastic, very generous portions and simply delicious. Service is perfect, not too heavy, just right to let you relax and enjoy your time. Chef came out of the kitchen and ask if everything was up to our satisfaction and chat a bit, really nice touch.I would recommend this place for any occasion, business lunch, romantic dinner, lazy sunday brunch or girls night out.Great job Guys,!!
5
Great evening with my mum! Food very tasty, we had the trippa and burrata to start follow by the linguine lobster and cacciucco. For dessert the semifredo is a must! Thanks to Gabriele and Paolo for the nice evening. I will be back.
5
Don't hesitate to go here, the service, wine list, menu, ambiance is spectacular. You won't be disappointed. The only time I could find an Italian restaurant like this, in Tokyo, it would cost 5x as much. Superb.
5
I been To Burlamacco last Friday, with my fiancÃ©.Was special night so we decide to have a degustation menu with wine pairing.We really loved the tuna and the linguine lobster!!I'm not expert of wine but the match was amazing.We will certainly came back to try the other specialty in the menu! Thank you Burlamacco and his staff!

We really enjoy the food , very delicious. No big portion , but this is fine. We had ravioli , steak and Tiramisu. All was delicious and the chef was really paying attention and checking with customers. Le only minus : the dinning room could be a little noisy , and the wine list only have Italian wines and is little expensive . They should allow other wines
4
The team managed to fit us in even though we had not made a reservation which we really appreciated. The appie was delicious but way over priced, had the buffalo cheese, which was very large but only came with 5 slices of tomato, had the ravioli for the main, it wasn't bad but nothing special. For the price I wouldn't return
5
What more can u ask for when this place serves delicious Italian food, has an awesome friendly heartwarming service n ambience. Clean and hygienic, even the kitchen n restroom looks as good as the dining area. Delicious starters really wish I could order all of them to try! My favourite is the octopus "polpo" dish! Chopped tuna n spinach salad r recommended too! Next I had pastas, I like the seafood pastas like the scallop 1. I think there's room for improvement in the pasta texture as it tasted as though it's not freshly made, don't have the chewy texture, not sure is it becos it's Italian cuisine n in Italy pple liked it this way.Next I had the meat dishes, wow they are really good ESPECIALLY the beef short ribs! Yummy! Best beef dish I ever tasted. The cod fish were done to the right done-ness! Chicken is juicy n tasty, yum! Last but not least we had desserts! I love the semifreddo! N the pannacotta is eggless yet tasted so good! Oh.. I almost forgot to mention the drinks we had, the Prosecco white sparkling wine recommended by Chef Gabriele! Really compliments the entire meal! And the lemon shot after the whole meal left us feeling really enjoyable and happy! Overall a superd experience! Would definitely recommend friends and return Burlamacco Ristorante! Cheers,Janice Tan *:

Burlamacco is a great medium size restaurant, with a romantic and elegant atmosphere. The decoration is nice and not over the top. We felt comfortable right away. The waiters were really friendly and even showed a sense of humour.We chose the burrata, which was delicious, just be aware that if you order it with parma ham, it means an extra 22$, which I found a bit expensive for the few slices of parma ham. Nevertheless it tasted amazing.My main course was the veal ravioli in mushroom sauce, the portion is very generous and the sauce is delicious.The wines were ok, the white wine was good, the red wine was rather tasteless.All in all it was a really nice and tasty dinner. Definitely one of the better italian restaurants in Singapore
5
Was welcome with a friendly smile the first thing. The service was excellet. The staff was knowledgeable, the recommendation was spot on.For starts, I had buratta with parma ham, it was creamy & flavourful and with the parma ham its amazing. polpo (octopus), was tender and refreshing with orange pulps. For pasta, fettuccine con capesante e piselli, the white wine sauce, rich and creamy is a must.For main course, I had a special, grill giant prawn, excellent! The prawn was cook perfectly accompanied with the lemon butter sauce. Magical. .Last but least the dessert, I end it light, as reconmend, a eggless pannacota with berry compote. Its light and simple.Plus after the whole meal they would offer you a shot of homemade limoncello for digestion. And its free.Overall its amazing. The servie staff was friendly and professional. The food was rustic and flavourful. And the ambiance was warm. Will be back again for sure

Today first time in Singapore, we found this restaurant on tripadvisor. Warm welcome by one of the owners. Super recommendations we've got for the food. Borrata, lobster with linguini arrabiatta, beef tenderloin and short beef rack. Accompanied by a 2006 Brunello and very good service personnel. The chef, Gabriele, came to our table couple of times to see how we like the food. Best Italian food I have had outside of Italy !Thank you!!!
5
I have to say the service blew my mind. I love the fact that they paid attention to what I enjoy and like. The food was definitely amazing, it just kept me wanting more. From the starters to the dessert, I was definitely kept busy. I would definitely encourage people to come by here and enjoy the experience that I had while I was here.
5
Ecxellent food and service.very cosy and warm ambience. A place to dine with friend and family. Their wine list is also worth to be mentioned. well done Paolo & Gabriele. Will visit you soon again. Thank you for the memorable evening.
5
Great food, excellent menu, outstanding service, fantastic wine cellar, one of my best italian dinners so far this year. For sure best in Singapore. Cool atmosphere

We came here for my husbands birthday. The food was excellent but the service made this a really special night. Would highly recommend.

We went here for a family dinner out, after reading the Tripadvisor reviews.The restaurant is in a popular and touristy part of Singapore, making it easy to get to and find.It looks good, outside and inside. Modern, clean and welcoming decor with a large, welcoming bar as you walk in.We were immediately welcomed and taken to our table. Drinks and menus arrived very fast and we were given an enthusiastic briefing on the specials of the day.Bread and (delicious) olive oil arrived fast and kept us going until the food arrived.We ordered the (I think) Bacio cheese, tomato and Parma Ham. This is amazing ! The cheese is like a soft mozzarella and SO good! It is a sharing dish and there was plenty for three.For mains, we had mussels, lamb rack and the beef ribs with a side of french fries. We all enjoyed our mains very much. Interestingly, the lamb looked cooked to perfection, tasted good but ever so slightly dry. Not sure how that happens. The mash served with the lamb and the beef was really yummy. All the dishes got high scores from us.Service was friendly and speedy throughout the meal
4
Went to this restaurant based on the Tripadvisor reviews and were not disappointed. Took the tasting menu and had excellent food, served in a perfect manner.The restaurant itself is light and cool - and it seemed that all kinds of customers are welcome. on the evening of our visit a Group with small children made themseves heard ;-)Absolutely worth trying - and going back to
4
Good food. Raviolis were great and Tascan soup as well. Nothing special with the beef tenderloin and the mozarella.Service was disappointing. My wife and I were a bit annoyed when we tried to ask for the desert menu. We had to wait a while before any of the server see us. Same when we asked for the bill. On of the guy just did not see us at all. Fortunately his colleague was more alert...The free limoncello helped putting back the review to 4

Burlamacco Italian Restaurant is located in an old historic building near the ChinaTown area of Singapore. The restaurant is warm and modern decorated. Staff is very welcoming and do their best to make you feel welcome. It's specialties are authentic Italian cuisine. Don't expect pizza's here. It's real Italian dining with pastas and dishes with meat and seafood. Their salad with tomatoes, parma ham and buffalo mozzarella cheese is fantastic. They also serve great Italian wines. The restaurant carries a large wine cellar.The menu card offers plenty of variety for everyone: salads, soups, pasta's meat, seafood. You will find something that you will enjoy. Staff is friendly and will be happy to help you with a choice if you have any special wishes. A few of the restaurant staff are certainly Italian. A small negatieve downside to this restaurant might be the noise. The restaurant is located in an old historical building which is actually not that spacious. It could become quite noisy inside the restaurant, when there are a lot of guests.Expect to pay around 90-100 singapore dollar for a starter, maincourse and desert and a glass of wine. De quality of the food is great, service is OK, so it's money well spend

We had a wonderful dinner at Burlamacco. The restaurant is on the ground floor of a lovely shophouses in the Chinatown area and very accessible. The staff were very warm and friendly from the word "go", asking if we were there to celebrate a special occasion when we were seated and were very knowledgeable in recommending wines and daily specials. My casual remark to my boyfriend about the beautiful glasses and wondering where they were from was answered by our server who even helpfully told us where to buy them :) we had the beef tripe and hand-chopped red tuna with avocado to start. The tripe came in a creamy tomato sauce with plenty of cheese and my boyfriend ate every single bit of it. The tuna and accompanying salad and avocado were very fresh and light on the palate. The olive oil drizzled the tuna really made the dish stand out. For mains, we shared their specialty Tuscan fish/seafood stew as well as the capellini in scampi broth. Both were excellent choices that complemented each other as the fish stew was a very hearty, rich and comforting dish chockful of fresh seafood whilst the capellini came in a lighter non-tomato based broth. I can just imagine having both dishes on a cold rainy night in front of the tv! The scampi was also very fresh and tasty. We had tiramisu to finish off the meal and this was one of the nicest tiramisus that I've had in Singapore. All in all an excellent dining choice
5
This is an excellent place for good Italian food. Service is also good, not forgetting the ambience! It is tucked along Amoy Street at No. 77, an old conserved shophouse. A good choice by the birthday girl! The executive set lunch was good value for money. When we were there in early May, I had the salmon which was very tasty and moist. The warm freshly baked bread dipped in olive oil was simply heavenly
5
This was my first time to dine in this restaurant with my husband. I was impressed that the food was so yummy and the service staff was friendly and passion. Highly recommended for family gathering. It also good for old school gathering place. I will definitely come back agai
5
Visited for Valentines Day with my wife and we had a really lovely evening, excellent food, really good wine list, and top notch service. We will be back!
5
What a fantastic Italian restaurant. Run by Paolo and Gabriele who were both ever present throughout the evening, chatting with their customers, we had a great night. Our starters of a Cabrese salad and a red tuna with avocado were lovely. We decided then to share a pasta course next and it was the best pasta dish I have ever tasted - Pappardelle with black pig ragout marinated for 7 days in red wine....wow, wow, wow. We both thought that the mains were fantastic and the wine was reasonably priced. The service was top notch and we both had a really enjoyable evening. We loved the place
5
I have dined at this restaurant on two occasions. Once for an informal dinner with girlfriends and once for a great evening of wine tasting. I was impressed by the "excellent" food and I was lucky enought to meet with the Chef who personally came to the table and spent some time talking to us and explaining the dishes. There are good quality wines served here, which is always important in this competitive restaurant market. The venue is intimate but also fun for a few friends. I would recommend it and definitely worth a try. I had extremely fresh burrata cheese at the restaurant and a very good fish dish. Enjoy
4
I really like this classy restaurant that made our family welcomed and felt at home. I dined there two weeks ago with my husband and two hungry sons who just wanted pastas. Service was as good as if we had ordered a more expensive degustation menu - the two affable owners stopped at our table to chat and as we shared every dish, our plates were changed and cutlery refreshed regularly. Awesome service! Every requests was no problem - we didn't like pici so the pasta was changed to penne in fresh cherry tomato and basil sauce while our request for a simple spaghetti aglio olio not on the menu was presented with some clams thrown in to add flavour 
4
Having been recommended by friends, we went here expecting great food and was not disappointed. We were welcomed warmly by the maitre d, who also demonstrated an excellent knowledge of the wines on his list. The food from start to finish was fantastic, from the tuna carpaccio, to the steak and then through to a gorgeous melt in the middle chocolate pudding for dessert. I am amazed that Chef Gabriele is able to produce such high quality food for the price. I like the fact that he comes out to personally see how you enjoyed his cooking - a nice personal touch. Sadly, the ambience of the restaurant is lacking somewhat and does let it down, and the service of the waiting staff (aside from the maitre d) needs some improvement. However, it terms of pure quality of food, great wines and affordability, Burlamacco is hard to beat

Came here with some friends and had the degustation dinner. Each dish had some good elements, but the combinations just didn't work, nor did the overall meal have a memorable impact.The starter of tuna carpaccio with avocado was excellent, but sadly everything went down hill from there. This was the only dish that qualified as a success.The second course was chilli pasta with lobster. The pasta was cooked perfectly, very nice, but would have benefited from some actual chilli. As for the lobster - it was tasty enough by itself, but I wonder what it was doing there, sitting on top of the pasta. Seemed like an escapee from an entirely different dish. Either that, or it was just plonked on top here to make the chilli pasta dish appear "up market".Main course I had the steak - which was beautifully cooked, but looked lonely, sitting on a large plate with bugger all to go with it, just a spoon of potatoes or something underneath it. Presentation wise - nothing. I've done better at home after a night out and a couple bottles of wine.I may have forgotten a course - as I say, it was not memorable.The dessert was childish. A small chocolate semifreddo with some drops of multi-coloured "toppings" seemingly squeezed from a supermarket tube. No flavour, no substance. Honestly, this dessert alone should make the restaurant ineligible for any stars from anybody. In fact, the waiters should be embarrassed every time they bring one of these to a table.So overall not an experience to be repeated. Now, there is obviously someone in the kitchen here who can cook, which is a shame really. With more attention to presentation and dishes that work well together this could be quite a good restaurant. If you want a lobster dish, make a lobster dish, don't just plonk it on top of a chilli pasta dish that could be quite good by itself.Price - not over the top, thank goodness, but high enough to expect more. A lot more

Upon setting into this small nook in the middle of the busy CBD, there is no trace of the busy fast paced footsteps of the reality just a few seconds ago. Instead, what greets you is a slice of Italian Heaven, with a great decor and soothing music. Chef Gabriele presents fantabulous cuisine which is absolutely divine. Had the slow cooked beef short ribs which is simply delectable. And their signature tiramisu to end off the night, a wonderful combination of the right texture and flavours. A great place to be dining in.
5
Tried this restaurant for the 1st time last week. We had the tuna and avocado appetizer, it was fresh chunks of raw tuna with avocado, there were crispy bits inside and was yummy. For mains we had the lobster arrabiatta & squid-ink risotto both were excellent. The lobster arrabiatta was really tasty (though my friend and I thought a spicier flavor would give it more of a kick, but it was good as is as well), the lobster was fresh. The risotto had a creamy texture and a cheesy flavor, sharing one portion between 2 was just perfect. We selected tiramisu for dessert, it was one of the better ones I've had in a while. Then they gave us shots of their homemade limoncello to finish up the meal. The service was excellent and the 2 owners were warm and friendly. We'll definitely be back!
5
A great little Italian nestled in up and coming Amoy St. I love loved that it has a relaxed casual atmosphere with top notch cuisine from chef Gabriele it's utterly delicious.Manager Paolo and his team were professional and friendly and were extremely knowledgable on their extensive cellar.We have visited Burlamacco several times and will continue to do so

At last, a reasonably priced good and real Italian restaurant. Not just blend basic pastas.Everything in the menu looked good. Gnocchis were top notch. Raviolis amazing.Lobster pasta looked perfect. Fairly good selection of wine.Wine by the glass available, with surprisingly good quality.Service slightly slow sometimes but always professional.Desserts alright, nothing fancy, but overall a very strong contestand amongst all italian restaurants.Quiet location in CBD, parking options.Haven't tried the set lunch but the options looked mouth savoring!!

How many times have you been to an Italian restaurant in Singapore, paid top draw prices and been disappointed in what you have got for your money. Not so with Burlamacco. The food is of the finest quality - which is not surprising considering the pedigree of the chef. I have been to this establishment on a number of occasions now and is a firm favourite

The main problem with Italian restaurants in Singapore is the conformity to a bland menu designed to make everybody (Westerners and Asians alike) more or less happy. At last, Chef Gabriele Piegaia and GM Paolo Colzani had the guts to offer something different and created Burlamacco: the only Italian restaurant in town that combines character, quality and a decent price level.Pick anything from the menu and you won't be disappointed. I know because I've been there many times and I've tried everything! Even the decaf espresso is good :-

Burlamacco is the clown-like figure who presides over the carnival in the Tuscan town of Viareggio, and is the town's mascot or so says Google.This new restaurant- about 3 months now the owner told me - is named after this character but that's where the similarities end. I was dining with friends in a group of 4 and on arrival found the style and ambience immediately relaxing and quietly stylish with friendly staff. The food and wine list are excellent and the degustation menu which I chose was varied and enjoyable with really good quality and presentation.Unfortunately for all the good things there were some serious negatives.Specifically,poor waiter service necessitating that we had to ask repeatedly for bread,for our order to be taken and on one occasion our main courses came out of the adjacent kitchen then disappeared back in as no servers were at hand to the frustration of everyone. After 3 months sorting out the waiting service is basic and a fundamental flaw here,busy or not. The bill for 4 was over S$500 so pricey.This said,after a suitable interval for the glitches to be sorted out,I would definitely go back,expensive as it is.The food is that good & Rome was not built in a day

Our party arrived late on a weekday and the restaurant was mainly empty with rather an industrial feel to the decor.However all the food we ordered was perfectly and freshly cooked. The chef came out to ensure we were enjoying the food and the wait staff were (refreshingly for Singapore) competent.Definitely to be recommended despite the uninspiring fixtures and fitting

We had a very good experience here where the food was good, service excellent and price wise, affordable. The only setback was when the crowd started streaming in, it became a bit noisy.I would recommend the beef tenderloin and the cod fish which were done very nicely. Juicy and satisfying would be the descriptives for the entrees ordered.Desert was a good finale where the tiramisu was just moist and tasty. Of course when the bill came, I was more than happy to make payment for a good dining experience with my family

We took the degustation menu. The quality of the food was superb. Very good value for money. The surroundings were very plain and the room extremely noisy which detracted from the experience. The staff were attentive and prompt. The free limoncello was the worst I've ever tasted - not fit to be associated with lemon. Still it was free so we did not drink i

This was a Trip Advisor inspired selection and it did not disappoint - the tasting menu was great and good value for money. The wine list was keenly priced and varied too. The lobster linguine must not be missed!The negatives were 1) very poor sound insulation made it sound more like a hawker centre than a smart restaurant (need to be improved) 2) we had to pour our own wine a couple of times and 3) the nice touch of a Limoncello on the house was disappointing as it hardly tasted of lemon.Will return for business lunches but the sound must be improved to make it a swanky dinner destination

this place is great in ambience, in service, in food, in wine selection. when you put 2 professional people like Paolo (manager) and Gabriele (chef) together, you have the top. I'm italian, and this is one of the few place in town where i can go and have full satisfaction even changing my choice in food everytime. Bravi ragazzi
