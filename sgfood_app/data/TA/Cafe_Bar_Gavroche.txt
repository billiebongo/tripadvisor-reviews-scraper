This first one would get blown away in the place was the fantastic decor! Parisian concept. Had dessert and coffee. Both were great though on the expensive side.
4
If you are looking for some good cheese and cold cuts, this is the place! The mixed platter is served with dark rye bread, good for 2. Wine is pricey though but you can try the flight of 3 for $25. Smoking section outside
4
The food quality is awesome especially the beef stew with red wine. However the portion could be more.
Hard to find authentic French food with nice ambient
5
The floss was delicious, staff were friendly and the decor is to die for - what more could you want?! Oh and its very reasonably priced, an all round winner!

A return visit to this little French cafe to try out opened face duck rillette toast. Love the ambience.
5
Returning again and again , privately or with business . Wonderful french place for drinks , lunch or light dinner. Food is good , simple and affordable , offer a few tables outside . Great team always personal and friendly service . Will definitely return

The place is beautiful decorated. Food choice seems a little limited. Service staff is great and prompt.
5
Indeed a cafe with good ambience and food. Quite authentic. They have different menu during weekdays and weekend though.
5
Cafe & Bar Gavroche is a nice little establishment situated along Tras Street in Tanjong Pagar. The interior is designed in a way to replicate a French cafe I believed. Food was nice and heartwarming (Chicken Stew) and the sandwich was surprisingly filling. If wine is your kind of thing, you can visit this place as majority of the other tables were enjoying a glass of wine
4
Finally have a try at this rustic cafe. It's an oversized Croque Madame for me. The bread is crispy with the ham, Gruyère cheese and béchamel sauce with an egg on top. They go pretty well together but I do prefer the one at Choupinette..... Definitely not a place for coffee or it's my luck? Lol..
4
Food was good! Good lunch place to consider for a quick business lunch around the cbd area. Good service as well.
4
Never disappointed visiting here, Pierre-Yves and the team are great, lovely for lunch with friends or a small work meeting. Perfect for early evening drinks, and a great date venue too. Lots of charisma.
5
Rustic french setting was interesting. Very nice eggs and cured meat platter! Service staff was engaging
4
Fresh bakery served with the most
Suitable ambience ! For a moment , I thought I had travelled to France .
5
Beautiful setting for a sunday brunch...and The Brioche and croissants were so SO So yummy! Every bite was heavenly!!
5
Delicious cheese and really good quality of food. With more charcuterie, it would have been perfect!
5
From the chairs and tables outside, to the bar and then the 'pave' floored natural light covered courtyard out the back. You feel like you are in a southern France cafe, honest food, a great wine list and lovely relaxed atmosphere.
5
Nice charming place. Had lunch there and it was fantastic except for the fish. The rest of the dishes were fantastic
5
Went to this Cafe last saturday to celebrate my anniversary with my girlfriend. I heard that the brunch menu was very appetizing and as well as the ambience. We tried out their Salmon with Egg Benedict/poached eggs, croque-madame topped with a sunrise egg and had a lava cake for dessert. The food is worth the waiting. I'll visit again.
5
I found this nice little cafÃ© through Chope. The atmosphere is so nice french. Fresh croissants and Chocolate Rolls are displayed on the counter, and the smelt is perfect. So did not surprise me that the croissant were superb, as Well as my smoked salmon with brioche and salad.
4
A nice quiet place for breakfast.. both croissant and pain au chocolate are fresh off the oven and really good.. Breakfast menu however could be a little boring and mostly consist of the combination of bread and eggs...
5
The ambience was great along with the soft music. Brunch was also good served by friendly staff though price is a bit steep. Overall, it was a pleasant experience.
4
Good place to chill out. Pleasant atmosphere with good service and food was good quality too. Worth a visit
5
Nice experience to have a weekend brunch in such fantastic French cafe~And the food are very yummy..the staffs are very friendly~
4
Visited for brunch with friends. Interior was beautiful, service great, food well done and cooked in traditional methods. Thoroughly worth visiting again.
3
Good for a salad or sandwich lunch in a relaxed environment. Ordered the salmon avocado salad and the goats cheeses salad. The salmon salad would have been much better if there was more avocado - there was literally just one tiny piece of avocado. Would be good if they could also offer soups. The quality of the bread was excellent. Pricing is on the high side for a cafe and most shocked that I was charged $16 for two coffees.

Singapore has many great areas. Singapore is not just Orchard Rd and Marina Bay. There are far more interesting places. And Gavroche is situated in one of these interesting places.We have now been to Gavroche twice. We did the same thing both times - we ordered a fine cheese platter and a few choice selections from the fine array of pastis and eau de vie. Is there a better way to spend an hour or so?A word of explanation. Do not confuse this bar with the brasserie of the same name situated nearly opposite. The bar is far better than the brasserie
5
This is my Paris! I love to take friends and business partners to this restaurant. It's chic and smart. Great food menu, generous portion, all dishes are good for two to share. Wonderful wine menu too. I love the wine testing package as well, great value and full of surprise! The manager is super friendly, always look after guests, another reason to be there too!
4
This place is packed on Friday after workhours. People come for the drinks, wine, champagne and finger food which are delectable. Finger food is light and just right fare for drinks and conversation. It is patronised mostly by europeans expats living and working in Singapore. Gavroche is in a shophouse - and the inner atrium is actually an airwell, i could see that I can plan for a group of 6 persons for dinner (that was my mental note) as the seating areas look spacious, but limited tables. Wine, liquer selection is great, light food fare served on wooden (like chopping blocks) blocks are the right size. I think it is value for money. Patrons are friendly and as expected in a typical cozy french bistro bar. They have a small tight team of servers/waiters (I think 4) and they are quick and attentive. If you can't go for dinner, or happy hour.. I noticed they are open for a lazy afternoon of coffee. You can sit down, enjoy the cool air within and watch the slow hour hand on the clock click by. A great place for people to come and have a chat in the afternoons, it is quiet, bright and cheery

/ The staff and store manager are friendly./ Tasty Salmon Benedicts and pretty big serving. / Good place with cool ambience to chill out with family and friends. / Rather convenient and easy to make reservation via Chope./ Authentic French aura emitting from this hideout.Definitely will be back real soon to try out their Saturdays' Raclette dinners!! Great thanks Cafe & Bar Gavroche, and your team (
5
Food was good and portion was very filling. Service was attentive as well. It was an enjoyable experience.
4
It is understaff , having only a waiter & Manager to serve. Food is good , wine is great , a pity that it is not playing some French Music. Will go back again SOON ! Keep it up !
5
Love the Brie Cheese with Truffle Honey Tartines! Brought my french friend there for dinner, and he loves the salad with foie gras! Forgot which red wine did he choose, but it was really good! Definitely a Bordeaux red wine ;)
5
Great little spot for a relaxed Brunch with friends. Croque Madame was a delight, as was the coffe and the kir royale..........friendly staff and a great way to spend a Sunday.
4
Met afew girlfriends for a catch up and a glass of wine. Great wine, small and cozy - would definitely recommend.
5
Very good quality of food. Good choice of french wines, some of them are quite affordable.
The outdoor space is too small and in the middle of a passage. So french.
4
Heard about this little cafÃ© near Duxton Hill and open for Sunday Brunch. My wife and I decided to give it a try and were not one bit disappointed. Lovely ambience with all the Parisian touches, well balanced brunch menu and excellent service. Definitely a place to visit over and over.
5
Besides having the omelette on the saltier side, the food was great! Their service was immaculate as well! They gave us complimentary croissants when we wanted to cancel them as we thought they had forgotten our orders! Highly recommended to anyone who only wants excellent food, service and ambience

Cafe Gavroche does well to leverage the chic, retro, Paris cafe 'brand'. Decor and lighting is spot on. Cosy and authentic feel. Cafe menu is credible . Lack of attention to detail from the kitchen on this particular visit though. Cold plates, barely warm food and undercooked. Empower your staff to engage with your customers and if they see there is a problem encourage them to discuss with the customer to turnaround the situation (rather than actively avoiding looking at the table in the hope it will go away)Pastries are always good though. Will be back..... For coffee.
4
The plat du jour (dish of the day) - Seared Chicken with Feta cheese, ham, green peas mash and red wine sauce is yums!! So are the tartines. Love the ambience too, it's totally Parisien! Present your Alliance Francaise member card and you are entitled to a glass of rose wine when you order any food. Waiter and waitress have good services too. Merci pour le diner
4
Really enjoyed the buzz, meal, good looking people, service, they did run out of my wine when i tried to order 2 more bottles, lol but they made up for it, reservations necessary, food comes with bread so if on diet, watch out!!
Enjoy!!
4
We go to this Cafe often, it is casual and fun place, The menu has many nice options and different tartines. The only thing was annoying on our last visit, the music was very loud.
5
I have visited the Cafe on many occasions and can not be more pleased with both the wine selection (truly great French wines) and the food.
The staff is pleasant and knowledgeable and I will definitely be back.
The brunch is especially nice.
5
It's not the first visit but every time we are sure to have a nice experience.
Every thing is well prepare and tasty.
Highly recommend if you are looking for a real French experience not cheap but worth it.
4
Very nice place where we can drink good wine and have very good French food. At the back, the place looks like my grand mother place, very nice to have feel of being back home.Just a note on the kitchen closing too early (10:30pm) for deserts only. As we arrived at 10pm we could only order some deserts. But that's ok, next time I'll come earlier...
5
I would highly recommend this place if you want to have a taste of different wines from the different regions in France accompanied by French cuisine. Its a casual and cosy place yet romantic in its own way. French food here is great too. :) I went there with a couple of friends and we enjoyed ourselves.
4
Love French cafes so was happy to stumble across this place in the small backstreets of Tanjong Pagar/Chinatown, an area brimming with bars and eats. The service was prompt and helpful and the food I had ranged from average to good. The foie gras with toast was a generous sized serving but the taste was fairly ordinary. The salmon salad also came as a generous portion and tasted great. They have an extensive wine list by the bottle and glass. I had a pinot noir that was light and refreshing. There is a little bit of outdoor seating on the narrow raised footpaths typical in that area, which is nice for couples or dining alone. Like many things in Singapore, it's expensive but the standard was high so couldn't really grumble

First time I chance upon this place I was thrilled as I love their concept of "wine tasting" packages. Ranges from cheap to high-end (First-class tasting package at SGD 48++ for 5 selection). My colleagues have the Regional Business Class, Ladies and Gentlemen tour package and when it arrives, it comes all at once with no label. 2 days later I was back again trying their First-Class regional and all our glasses are labelled. So I'm not sure if it is only for First-class where your wine-tasting glass is labelled or they're not being consistent. When I was there at lunch time trying their wine-tasting, I felt ambience was great as there was sunlight coming through from their roof-top makes it rather authentic coupled with their wooden chairs, gives a feel of a lazy afternoon tuck at their back of the cafe. When I was back again at 6pm, I felt ambience was not right for wine. I can't explain. Is not like Cava Wine bar at Shaw or the successful Wine Company at Harbor front or Wine Connection at Unity Street. Even 52 Duxton Road The Merchant has better ambience to have a nice bottle of wine to wind down at 5 or 6pm. Service is pretty slow as usually only 1 poor staff (local) attending to everyone while there is a manager (I think he's French) that doesn't seem to work. But if you must go, pls try their Cheese Platter - is good
5
Been to Gavroche twice now and can wholeheartedly endorse them. Awesome food and great wine. It's a hidden gem. The steak both time has been fantastic. The salmon tartar as well is amazing. Took large parties both times and everyone walked away happy. Better book otherwise it's difficult to find a table
4
I joined a colleague for a few drinks here on a Tuesday night. We scored a table on the footpath to watch the world go by. We didn't eat but the food looked good. The wine list is lovely - I had a delicious Sancerre. It is on a quiet street but still presents lots of people watching and I would have felt quite comfortable being a solo traveller her
3
their croque madam was good. but the cappuccino was very disappointing. foam was ugly and there it tasted more like a cafe latte or Au lait.
5
- Excellent food (see photo attached)
- very very nice decor and ambiance, I felt like I was transferred to a different place!
- perfect chill-out spot
5
A great spot. Bar across road, very good steak, lovely French wine and excellent service . A real happening place and must book to get a seat. Steak is great and so is the starters selection of cold meats etc.
4
The interior of the cafe was generally sectioned into 3 areas - the back reminiscent of a dining area with kitchen for large groups, the middle where skylight allowed natural light to fill the compound while retaining the comfort of air-conditioners, and the entrance section mainly occupied by the barista's bar. Seatings were mildly limited so we were fortunate to arrive before noon for our brunch as customers started streaming in past 12.Coffee lovers on the table got ourselves a pot of French-brewed black coffee and cappuccino, and a pot of TWG Morocco Mint went to the sole non-coffee drinker. I did not inquire the opinion of my friend's pot of joe, but mine was mildly delicious in its foamy way.There were plenty of Oeufs thrown around the menu, so we took our time to pick our choices since all of us were egg lovers. The simpletons could pick from Classic Eggs where eggs were prepared scrambled, boiled, fried or as omelette. We adventurous lot got ourselves some Specialties, which earned thumb ups from us with the Oeufs Benedict and Smoked Salmon Oeufs Benedict

Wednesday evenings are crazy at the Cafe Gavroche, a belle-epoque style French bistro on Tras St. The reason is simple: free pour of the house rose from 7-9PM for all women patrons. The cafe/bar has a good, authentic French vibe. The food is adequate bar-bistro fare: platters of cheese and charcuterie come off best. The wine selection is really so-so: late vintage wines, but from somewhat unusual regions such as Savoie and Jura
4
On Wednesday evenings, this chic and highly popular bistro offers all ladies unlimited pours of their tasty house rose (no minimum spend or anything!) It's very generous and the vibe is infectious and fun. They also have super fresh oysters and other French staples. Definitely worth a return visit

I have to hand it to the French when it comes to living it up. My business associate and I, fresh and stuffed from dinner at Cafe & Bar Gavroche's sister restaurant across the street, the Brasserie Gavroche, decided to wind down over (more) drinks and a fat cigar.And we were richly awarded for our endeavours. When we walked in, or to be more accurate, waddled in, we were greeted with a long wooden bar, reportedly originating from Normandy, pre World War II, circa 1920.You would be forgiven for thinking you were transported to Paris. There is a “Terrace” section, replete with natural light, cobblestone flooring, Drucker wicker chairs and tables, a long rustic wooden table, Opaline hanging lamps, a heavy-set cast iron antique stove and wall-hung copper pots of varying sizes. Forgoing the cozy alcove, we opted to sit outside for some 'fresh air' and people watch. We didn't order any food, instead imbibed in a bottle from the Rhone valley. And it was sublime. The environment was reminiscent of my time in a Parisian cafe. Where time stood still. Love it.Eyeing the comprehensive list of wine, champagne, cocktail, as well as the 'bar food' available, I am pretty sure I will be back, with an empty stomach, next time

For more reviews, visit my site at ms-skinnyfatThe things i miss most about Paris are first, the buttery and flaky croissants and then the beautiful people watching from the quaint sidewalks. I was delighted to discover a piece of Paris, right in the heart of Singapore at Cafe & Bar Gavroche.Cafe & Bar Gavroche is opened by Chef Patron Frederic Colin, which also owns the successful Brasserie Gavroche, also on Tras Street. The conservation shophouse would not be out of place in Paris with its cobblestone flooring, Drucker wicker chairs and pre World War artefacts which includes the 4.2m wooden bar originating from Normandy, circa 1920.I absolutely love the outdoors-indoor concept of The Terrace, a natural light filled space, where S and i enjoyed their weekend brunch.We got started on the freshly baked and rustic croissants ($2.50) and pain au chocolate ($3.50).These are LOVE. Flaky, salty, crumbly and glossy pastries are the best. They are absolutely out of this world especially when paired with creamy French butter and Bonne Maman jams. Definitely a mood lifter!Smoked Salmon Oeufs Benedict ($25)- I loved the that Gavroche uses Brioche instead of muffin and the pillowy bun took in all that eggy goodness. The hollandaise is on the light side but that's what made it French.Tartine d'oeufs brouilles, tapenade et tomatoes ($17)- was an interesting open faced country bread topped with scrambled egg and spread with tapenade olives and sweet tomatoes. This is certainly a refreshing breakfast sandwich.Not to be missed is also their Croque Madame ($18), a hot favorite with many diners that i vow to try the next time i return.We ended breakfast on a sweet note with the profiteroles and i was extremely sure that Gavroche does really good breads and pastries. This is certainly where i'd be when i need a dose of Paris.Weekend breakfast are available from 10.30am to 2pm

Excellent food ! I'm French and I can tell you the food is delicious. If you want real french food, this is the place to be for a lunch or a dinner ! The service is good and thé restaurant design make you feel like home in Paris. I recommend the "vol-au-vent" : superb 
5
Parisian touch in Singapore.Definitely the place to go for a nice atmosphere. Good food - Awesome wine! The bar tender is an expert about wine and he knows how to make you enjoy your time. I, for sur, recommend that place and guarantee you'll have a good time!
