I never had a chance to dine at the outlet. Always take away. At least 6-7 times over the past months. Take away again today and am surprised with the little portion of sashimi sitting on the sushi rice. Standard has dropped?

Heard about this place from a colleague who frequents here about once every 2 weeks. I finally made my way here as Upper Thomson is far from where I live and was extremely lucky to find a seat on arrival. I saw a couple of other diners waiting in line for about 5-10 minutes for the next available table so lucky was on my side.Nearly every table ordered their signature Bara Chirashi Don and I can understand why. One bowl has a hefty amount of fish that's already been marinated in sauce. The yakiniku would have tasted better if it was seeved hot but was nonetheless delicious.We also ordered their Salmon platter with includes slices of salmon sashimi, salmon belly and ikura (who can say no to ikura!). Our waiter Philip made an excellent recommendation to try their special of the day: white tuna sashimi. OMG, best sashimi I have ever tasted in a while. So worth it and it just melts in your mouth. It was so good that we ordered another portion.Amazing and affordable. I am eating it 4/5 because of location and it's not easily accessible by MRT. Will come back for more when I get the chance!

My wife and I are big sushi and sashimi fans and had it in various places in the Japan, the US and Europe. But I must honestly say that the quality, freshness and variety in Suschiro is truly exceptional. Equally impressive was the perfect presentation on authentic Japanese ceramic tableware, just beautiful. The staff was not only extremely friendly but also had profound knowledge about what they were serving and it's cultural heritage. The restaurant is set up in a shopping plaza, but the food could easily compete and actually beat many of high end sushi restaurants in posh places. Any time again when we are in Singapore

This is a casual eating outlet and is our family's favorite outlet for Japanese food. The ingredients used are always fresh and the portions very generous. The cooking is flavour-some and spot on. My personal favorites are the premium unagi-don and the duck-gyudon with onsen egg. Simply delicious. The down side is that the queue especially during weekends is quite long because this restaurant is very popular and no reservations allowed, and everytime we had a meal there, it is always packed to the brim. The seating is also not the most comfortable and due to the open kitchen concept, it tends to get warm. But one is here for the food, not to admire the decor and I will easily overlook this minior discomfort because they are more than compensated by the great food. I will let the food pictures do the talking. I am actually surprised by the low score of this restaurant in tripadvisor, mainly due to some negative reviews, which frankly speaking, I am kind of skeptical. We have patronized this restaurant numerous time and have always got great food and good service. In terms of value for money, I will say Sushiro is probably the best in Singapore that I have tried, and I have tried many. On those complaints about small portions, this is puzzling because nearly every visit we have, the food portions were always more than generous, unless they selectively give some customers smaller portions? Unlikely, as evident by the enduring popularity of this restaurant. Then about the complaints on perceived rude service. This is a very popular restaurant with many people queuing and they have very high turnover of tables. So it is quite understand the waitress do not want to waste time waiting around for customers to take ages to make up their mind on what to order. As long as they can maintain this standard, we will go back again and again

Was there Sunday night n we ordered the premium bara charaishi don . It's just a thin layer of sashimi n beyond that it's all rice ! ( see photo shot to understand ). Not as fresh n the green tea served is very diluted , taste like plain water. We're very disappointed and will not return 
4
I always get the Bara Chirashi don or salad here and they never fail.At about $12 per person, I'd say it's a steal!Queues can get quite dreary and when you're done with the meal the waiters don't expect you to stick around so you don't get to sit down and chat with friends (unless you're a really slow eater!).They are closed on Tuesdays, and only open from 1145-1415 and 1745-2115 hours

It helps to arrive Super early and queue before restaurant opens as it fills up within a span of minutes by eager diners. Every bowl of Dons and every piece of sushi is delicately prepared to serve and keep to its authentic taste. Serving isn’t huge but it’s worth the price and wait.

Arrived at Thomson Plaza at about 6.15 pm hoping that there will be not so many people in the que at the main Shushiro restaurant. To our surprise,there must be about 20 people in the queue. We went to its first outlet which serves a much smaller menu. This outlet is small and the tables are small too. Its a place to "eat and go" and not for a leisure relaxing meal.We ordered a Sushiro Bara Chirashi Don premium. The chawanmushi was smooth and good. The Chirashi don was good but it was better the last time I took it about a month ago. The tofu was average. They should give more shredded vegetables as the portion was so tiny. My dining partner said the gyoza was excellent. We also ordered a salmon mentaiyaki. It was good but not outstanding. I will definitely not wait for more than 45 minutes for this restaurant. If there is no queue, I will definitely retur
5
For under $20, it's worth the queue for an affordable Chirashi Don. Queue may take up to an hour or so. They have recently added a number queue system which eases alot without having to stand at the same spot over an extended period. Their lunches comes with choice of set, either salad + $3 or salad and sashimi + $5, this is not available during dinner
5
Wife with good friend Chris suggested this restaurant for the men to try out. And it is the ladies treat. Queue has build up when we arrived around noon. Took our queue number and suggested that we come back around 30 minutes later which allow a cuppa of coffee.Turnover was fast. Service was excellent and efficient. Small place but furniture packs well. I think there is space for about 30 guests.We had the unagi and sushi set.It was excellent. Remind me a bit of my favourite sushi place near Tokyo Station.Will definitely visit again.Keep up the good work

Head straight for the queue 1st and decide later if you can hold on to your hunger. The queue starts outside GNC store and NOT outside the sushi store. So when u see no one outside the store, it is not possible. You may want to pack to go. After 40mins, I decided to for the premium Bara as I thought the picture can't be real. My kids goes for teh normal bars set @$13z What came onto my table was more than my 1 week worth of fish omega vitamins! See the PiCtures... worth the dollar and love the taste. Coming back again.. yes I will. If not I am sure my kids will drag me here.. to start queuing 1st.

Always pleased to come here for one of Singapore's most affordable and highly rated Bara Chirashi Don. Service is good, price is very fair and the quality is amazing. Huge chunks of salmon and tuna that is fresh and their sauce and seasonings used to compliment it goes very well indeed. Not to be missed! Do check their opening timings carefully, they usually close for awhile in the afternoons. Instagram: @millarjordan

I will review it in point form.1. Very long queue2. Cheap chirashi don, the rest of the items are not cheap3. Didn't like the seasoning of the chirashi, sesame oil over powered the dish4. Do not be tempted to add soup and salad to your meal, you will regret big time!5. You get your food faster if you take awa
5
Their signature dish is the bara chirashi. At $13 I would say this is the cheapest one in Singapore. If you will like more, go for the premium version at double the price. It is fresh and generous portions of tuna salmon and ika. For premium they give you more plus other premium fishes such as swordfish. Value for money but go before opening to avoid the long queue.
5
Ever since I got to know about this place, its been my favourite chirashi place! Its always very crowded! You have to queue for it. Factor in abt 30-45mins of waiting time during peak hours. Its not a big place, so that probably explains the wait. But oh well, waiting for good food is worth it
2
The chirashi don was ok but the tori katsu(chicken in egg sauce) was so sweet and the chicken was so soft! Tasted strange. Queued at the restaurant on 1st level not the one near food court. Waste of my time. If you just want chirashi don, my advice is to just buy and take away. No need to queue

This restaurant started out with a small set up in Thomson Plaza. The business is very good and soon it took over a proper unit. There is always a long queue especially on weekends. The restaurant opens at 5.45pm. Take away from the initial small outfit also commence from 5.45pm. I attemped several times to eat or take away from Sushiro after reading many good reviews but was always turn off by the queue.Finally i managed to buy 2 Bara Chirashi Don this evening, take away. My daughter and I were totally disappointed. We often take away Kaisen Don from Takeshimaya. It may be a few dollars more expensive, but the quantity of the raw fish is much more and the Don is definitely way tastier. Sushiro is really just average
5
Lunched on Sushiro's bara chirashi don on two consecutive saturdays, once takeaway and once eating in. Probably because this is a cold meal anyway, both times the food tasted the same and I felt that the portions were similar as well.Especially like the bara chirashi don here because other than tuna and salmon, the marinated sashimi mix included prawns and octopus as well. At 12.80 for a generous portion, it was definitely worth it.Noted that many reviewers had to endure the queue. When we visited for dine-in, the queue at Sushiro was indeed quite long (12 persons in front of us) so we decided to visit their sister outlet Ryori instead. We were the first people in the queue, so once a couple finished their meal we quickly took their seats. When I ordered my food for takeaway one week earlier, it was ready in 10 minutes. On that day, I was there at around 2.10pm, 5 minutes before their last order for lunch. They were still seating customers so perhaps can try nearer closing.Sushiro's sister outlet, Ryori, is at the same level just outside koufu. While this sister outlet focuses on cooked food, they also serve Sushiro's bara chirashi don. Currently, they do not serve the other variations of raw seafood available at Sushiro (e.g. premium bara chirashi don, purely salmon or purely tuna don etc). There seems to be less queue at Ryori, so if you want the regular Sushiro bara chirashi don you may consider popping by Ryori

Was recommend by my son to check out Sushiro on Fri lunch after hearing about the rave it garnered amongst the Youths. Arrived at 1120am & was 5th in the que, the line build up minutes after me and there were 20+ people when the shop opens at 1145am. A pleasant surprise to the quality / serving, highly comparable to the bigger & more well know brands. It certainly will give the 2nd floor Sushi Tei a good fight...
4
Visit this funny old fashioned mall for supermarket shopping and always wondered why the snaking queue from morning til night. Even arriving in a weekday at 5.45pm there were 10 pax in front of us.Ordered the salmon Sushi set, grill salmon rice and Chirashi don to try, sharing a squeeze table with 2 other diners. V fast service and excellent, melt in your mouth dishes! Didn't realise that they also have a tiny takeaway section. Next time I'd dao- pao the Chirashi don $12. Small but quality menu. Excellent value
5
Always long queue, but cannot blame everyone because the quality of sushi is very good. the chirashi-don might be the cheapest for this quality.
3
The queue is surprisingly long given the obscurity of the location. The portion is generous and the price not unreasonable but the taste, particularly the rice, is just so so. I would slightly prefer Koji @ China Square, which is of similar menu.
1
Every time I tried the queue it's so very long. So I never have a chance to eat here. They must be really good and cheap to have such a long queue!!!!
4
At $12.80, the bara chirashi was certainly value-for-money, with plump pieces of salmon and tuna etc on a bowl of rice that turned out to be more filling than it looked. We were less impressed by the hotate mentaiyaki (two for $10.80), however.Friendly and efficient service - no issues at all
2
Been here many times due to the low prices of barachirashi. Several times we had cordial service from service staff. Today however we were served by a very rude Filipino woman. She was so impatient while waiting for us to decide what to order. When we ordered the first dish she said 2 orders but I corrected her. She said only one with a mocking face and frown. Give us some time to think right?! Foreign talent my foot. So rude. After we decided on the second dish she curtly repeated the order. The food came quickly as it's fast food. While eating I can see that the staff were hawking us and really just waiting for us to finish up and vacate the table. Before I finished my food a male waiter came around and said can I clear ? He took all the dishes before we replied. I hung onto my dish with bits of sashimi left! This is the rudest restaurant staff I have seen in Singapore so far who obviously are only interested in making a quick buck. The sashimi cubes were not fresh and they were marshy. A bowl of greens cost $5.80 and boy was that a rip off. Never go again
4
I've dined here when it first opened and this is my second time. Used to be a tiny shop with really friendly staff but now they have another shop located in the mall apart from the tiny shop.The small shop only serves cooked dons and no sashimi or sushi therefore you'd have to fight the long queues at their new store. The service has gone down from courteous staff at the beginning to 'arrogant don't need to serve you' type of behaviour. Ordered the niku don with onsen tamago and my friend had the unatama don. The food was not bad so if you ignore the service you'd have a quite great meal
4
Had the chirashi Don & paid $12.80 (with no service charge and GST). It was fresh and good. I would think it is value for money. A glass of plain water is charged at $0.20, which is reasonable (although I strongly feel that restaurant should not charge their customers for plain water)
4
The outlet took over the space formerly occupied by Sushiro. Compared to Sushiro, there was no queue here during lunch hour. Menu was limited to a single sheet. Sides of the day was just 2 choices. Only cash payment was accepted here. No GST or service charge. Water was chargeable here. If you ordered green tea, help yourself to the hot and cold version at the counter. Place order at the cashier. Free sitting. Plenty of empty seats. There was just 3 couples of customers besides me.Tokyo Gyuniku Don ($12)Tender slices of beef on top of plain rice, with an Onsen egg in the centre. Mixed it up, the dish actually tasted not bad although I wished that better quality could be used here
4
Extremely generous portions of sashimi in every bowl of bara chirashi don. Its exactly as it looks like in the cover photo of Sushiro. There is a tad too much olive oil in their dish and I once tasted a bitter aftertaste probably due to burnt olive oil.However, for only $12.80, I have no complaints about it. The queue is always long for this place and the average waiting time would be about an hour. If you cannot/do not want to wait that long, you can walk directly into the restaurant to buy their ready-made takeaway sets which are identical to their dine in option

Sushiro is located at Thompson Plaza. Nearest MRT is Marymount MRT station. Waiting time to get a seat takes about 30 to 45 minutes. As they have expended with the opening of another shop with more seats, the new shop besides the Lego store is the one that serves Bara Chirashi Don. The shop that is opposite Koufu (food court) does not serve Bara Chirashi Don, but it offers other delectable Japanese food too. My friends and I ordered Bara Chirashi Don. Food comes within 5 minutes upon order, which is really fast. It would be even more efficient if our order can be placed while we are still queueing up, such that once we get directed to our seats, the food is served immediately. Current work flow is that we only get to place our order when we get our seats. Food wise, the portion of Bara Chirashi Don is huge even though the serving bowl looks small! I was really full after eating everything! The amount of sashimi and rice they gave was a lot. A lot in a way it's good! Other Chirashi Don which I ate at other places usually do not have a portion that "mountain" off the bowl, but Sushiro's Bara Chirashi Don has a portion which "mountain" off the bowl. The wasabi given was also quite a lot! It was knead into a ball on your bowl and you get to put it on a sauce plate and add the soya sauce as much as you like! In addition, the food taste so good and is value for money! I would visit again if I can!

I've been coming to Sushiro for a while now. Yes, the queue can be annoying - but you can always get take away. I've not had anything on the menu that I've not liked.
5
Went there for lunch on a weekday. At 12pm, queue time was about 30 mins. The bara chirashi was $13 and was fantastic, super yummy. Juicy chunks of tuna, salmon, octopus and prawn all well marinated. Highly recommended!
5
Very tasty food at a good price, very recommendable. 30min queue though they should increase capacity
5
Simple and yet delicious Japanese chirashi don, fresh sashimi at this little place in Thomson Plaza.
Definitely must try!
5
Came here several times with my friend. Each time we visit, we must have our chirashi don. Added $5 to make our chirashi don into set which come with a small portion of salad, 3 thick slices of salmon and a small bowl of miso soup.This time we had chawamushi- it was nice and smooth. We also had salmon belly, hamachi and tuna sashimi. Oishi!!!
5
Although i am not a sashimi lover, this place offers the freshest fishes. My favorite is the salmon belly don, the belly is so soft you have to pick it up with a spoon instead of chop stick to prevent it from breaking apart, coupled with the Japanese sticky rice. Its an taste party of flavors and freshness in your mouth! Remember to reach before the opening time to queu

Thompson Plaza, bit of a boring mall, so why were people always in a queue for such a tiny Japanese place, I couldn't figure it but I couldn't be bothered to join the queue either. But now they have moved to a bigger place (still within TP), so there is still a queue but it moves more quickly. So I took the plunge and joined the Q.It took about 15mins in the Q and we elected to share a table with another couple, but the table is a decent size so not really an issue. Now a know why it's a sensation! It's all about the food!We had a Bara chirashi Don set each, and the portion is good and very fresh and and tasty, but the rice is so well seasoned that it makes the dish a delight.But if you want a leisurely relaxed meal to take your time over, I suggest this is not for you, the place is crowded and the music loud, so eat enjoy and move on. I found the staff efficient and polite but the focus is on getting the tables turned around as quickly as it is polite to do so, so they don't hurry you out but place isn't designed to encourage you to linger, but hey before you complain remember, part of the reason they can offer so much value is the throughput.I would happily q again to enjoy their awesome foo

Fantastic sashimi. Price is mid tier, but that's what you expect for above average sashimi. I dare say it's better than most, save for proper large Japanese restaurants, e.g. Sun with moon. Queue is terribly long, almost an hour ok weekend dinners, due to small seating area. Cooks look so happy preparing the food, and the rice is hot and delicious. Fantastic salmon belly don melts in your mouth.

The pictures speak for itself. Look at that mountain of goodness - the Premium Chirashi Don! We also had the today's special - Salmon Belly Teriyaki Don and extra order of ebi mentai sushi and unagi sushi which were very good too. This small restaurant sits about 20. I would recommend you arrive 15 minutes ahead of opening hours to queue. Given the small space and with people constantly in the line, I personally would not order uni as I want to savour it slowly.

Located at Thomson Plaza level 1. They don't take reservation. Limited tables. Got to queue so be there early. Operating hours: (close on tues)11.45am-2.15pm and 5.45pm-9.15pmLimited choices on their menu. Food is cheap and good. Ordered the chirashi don, salmon sashimi, and their sushi. Generous portion. It's so good I ordered more sushi. No gst and service charge. Highly Recommended!
4
Nice bara shirashi don, the sashimi is very fresh and price reasonable for the quality and quantity. Good to find a gem in Thomson Plaza.
4
The food here is very tasty and the raw fish is well marinated. This is a very popular place for lunch and dinner with queues. I don't think the fish is of good quality but it tastes good maybe because it is well marinated.
4
A small space at level one Thomson plaza serving fresh chirashi Don. Definitely more value for money as well as better quality than the usual franchise restaurants and some sushi chains I must say. Expect to queue.
2
I have been here several times, as I do find the food nice & fresh mostly. But today, an incident made me decided not to patronize this small restaurant again. The place is small, but I feel that they should not squeeze 4 pax to a small table, which is already too small for 2 pax. Very obvious that that they do not care much about the comfort and dining experience of diners. I also find that the staff are not experienced and the queuing system is very inflexible. Even if your a diner is in the mall, but need to step away for just a while to washroom , they insisted all must be present, before seats and table can be allocated. It is very inflexible, even when customers, assured them that that pax will be back very soon. Again, a factor of money and cents, and care less about the customers. I will find a better and friendlier place for chirashi don
5
I have heard many of my friends rave about how tasty Sushiro is since months but haven't had the opportunity to try it, and I finally did today and IT WAS GREAT! Especially for the value and the portion of sashimi you get. Hot green tea is free-flow. Queues can get long though (try to come after 1pm if you're coming on weekends)
4
Was introduced to this place by my cousin who dines there frequently and I totally loved the dishes! Word of advice, always call and reserve a table, the place is packed to the brim because the food is just too good ! Boyfriend and I ordered lots of items with mentaiko as it is our favourite. Heard that the chef even trained in Japan! Everything we ordered was so good, the salmon and tuna was really fresh. Would visit again with my parents 
4
Sushiro reminds me of those small hole in a wall shops in Japan selling sushi with seats by the bar seeing what the chef is doing. We have been to Thomson Plaza quite a few times but only chanced upon it today.The sashimi is generally good except the scallop wasn't sweet and fresh like the ones I had in Japan. Service staff were prompt and helpful. Took us less than 15 mins to get our seats at about 7pm on a Saturday.We ordered the premium Kaisen-don (comes with salmon belly, botan prawn and scallop) and the the otoro and salmon belly don. Total bill came out to be S$60+.We'll probably return again as we are in the area at least once a week
4
The restaurant is a small open concept, and located in front of the mall's food court. There is limited dine in area. Credit card, cash and NETS are accepted as payment. Ice water is chargeable here. There is no GST or service charge.Bara-chirashi Don ($12.80)Assorted seafood cube over sushi riceThe raw seafood cubes was marinated in a slightly but savoury mixture. Topup $5 for miso soup, salad, salmon sashimi to make it a set lunch.The meal was quite filling, although it did not look big when served.Sake Mentai ($3.80/ 2 pieces)Salmon Aburi MentaiThe slightly torched salmon simply melt in the mouth.Tamago Mentai ($3.80/ 2 pieces)Japanese Omelette MentaiThe sweet and moist egg roll was a great combination with the savoury mentai sauce.Overall the food was delicious. The seats were quite near to each other
5
Many reviews have been written about the freshness and umami taste of their japanese cuisine. Besides the great value for good food, this little outfit of Sushiro reminds me of the wonderful memories I had eating at small sushi bars when I was in Japan. Although the seating is a little tight, it has a warm and cosy feeling to it
4
Located in a precarious location at the basement of Thomson Plaza, it could easily be missed if not for the snaking queue or the adorable sushiro bear stand. Limited seating available and they pride themselves by serving fresh sashimi, sashimi don or donburi at wallet friendly price.They have a simple sumptuous menu filled with mouth-watering sushi and dons.5 pcs torched Nigiri Sushi Set ($9.80) – The nigiri sushi set fell a little short on our expectations. The filet of raw fishes felt a little dry and lacks the sensational taste of a seasoned sushi overall.Bara-chirashi Don ($12.80) – On the other hand the petite coveted Bara-chirashi don is filled with fresh chunky varieties of sashimi – salmon, tuna, octopus and juicy popping ikura. The rice and sashimi was well mixed and perfumed with sesame oil and soy sauce. Though the serving size is a little smaller than the conventional, but it still warm and fill the stomach well with probably just another sharing dish if you are a bigger eater.The wait can be crazily 45mins long. You can consider making a reservation via SMS but the slots are pretty much limited. Even you have made the reservation, you would still have to wait for the next available table instead of the usual way where a table is reserved for you before your arrival, so it works more like a priority queue. The only one thing that will make me return is none other than the $12.80 bara-chirashi don but with the queuing time, probably only if i am in the vicinity
