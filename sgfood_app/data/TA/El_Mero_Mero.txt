Excellent mexcan food, probably the best in Singapore. The Mexican staff is warm and very nice. I will definitely come back

The food was very good and the drinks were good also. We ate on a Saturday night and the restaurant was not too busy, the service was fast and efficient.
4
Overall not bad. Portion can be bigger.. Servise standards is good. Nice atmosatmos too. Family friendly asawell

I like my americanised Mexican food like burritos. El mero mero elevates tacos and burritos to a different level my using freshly prepared meats and sauces. Quite pricey however. Service was spotty despite the restaurant being very empty. Took a Long time to get attention.

By far, in Singapore, the most legit Authentic Mexican restaurant with servers being Hispanic with an accent too!I love the location and love the outdoor seating - seems like you're eating in a garden. We ordered the Spanish wine and Margarita and were tasty. For starters we got the guacamole chips n salsa. Green salsa was tasty and spicy. The red salsa was very good had a Smokey flavor to it and not super spicy. The guac was absolutely fresh and made in-house. Husband got the El Mero Mero and was absolutely delicious and a decent portion. Easily can be shared by 2-people. I ordered the Enmoladas. It's been a long long time where I went to a restaurant and they nail a mole sauce. Some are too sweet or too much of this n that....this was equal hot n sweet. 3 tortillas was plenty and the sauce was in abundance. Dessert we ordered the Churros-oh my so darn delicious. Still trying to figure out what's in the chocolate sauce. So good. People who haven't lived or visited Mexico have no clue what's good food. I lived most of my life in Southern California and been to Mexico too many times to tell you what's good n what's not. Def def def going back very soon!

not worth the money. for the prices they could really work on the service - we had to ask for everything, no one in site so a couple of times had to walk to the counter. music - you could here jazz, pop and traditional Chinese sounds - a cacophony of sort. food - nothing spectacular - for these prices?location great , good place for kids to run around if you are a family but would not recommend this place. have not tried the cocktails - so perhaps this is their selling point. will not go back
5
If you like interesting and inventive cocktails this is a great place to go. The bar manager really knows his mixology and makes quite fabulous drinks. We went here twice during our visit to Singapore, sat at the bar and had him or his fellow bartender make us cocktails based on our preferences. We never ordered from the menu and had some really great cocktails here.The food? It’s the cocktails that we’ll remember from this place!
5
Serene yet crisps ambient, friendly staff, qood quality tasty food with reasonable price. Great wine, very chill and yet exciting place to be. Great spot to people watch, n chit chat. Perfect background uplifting music, cant find any flaws, as long as its not raining (it is an open concept restaurant under the stars with indoor part for rainy days). Will be back again! And again!!!

I’ve been before & love their margaritas. But this time the service was shocking, it was raining heavily so we had to move inside. I asked the staff if we could & they said yes, then when we got inside all the tables were reserved, I then asked where we could sit, 6 staff just looked at me blankly. Finally after asking 4 times we were given a table, for the first half of the night we had to ask for another drink, we where the only people there and the staff our numbered us 2:1, we also had to ask for salt on the margarita every round. We were there over 3 hours & when we left only 2 of the room full of reserved tables had people at them

I was a regular, back for dinner last night with my husband. It was a Saturday so we tried to make reservation in the afternoon, called with no answers, eventually made reservation on Chope.com. When we arrived, they have no our reservation. Seated outdoor for almost 10 minutes and nobody came over, we raised hands to get menu. (Table next to ours has the same, waited for 15m almost after sitting down). I loved their tacos and suckling pig even though it is overpriced, but the service before was must better. Last night was a true disappointment. I realised the whole crew has changed since I last time visited. Ordered 2 glasses of wine and only one glass was delivered. Food was served in oversized plates, hardly fit in to the small table. And no side plates or cutlery or napkins, I asked how would they like us to eat? Water never been refilled through the whole night. Besides the wild fish tacos, everything else was tasteless. The crew are friendly but obviously lack of training, they have no control on the flow and everyone was running and rushing. We paid 160$ for 6 pieces of tacos, 1 main of sucking pig and 2 glasses of wine. The quality and taste of the food is really not worth paying this amount. Very disappointed as I highly recommended to eat here when my Husband suggested somewhere else. I hope the management could look into this and at least provide some trainings to the crew. Also the taste of the food, not sure if the Chef has been changed.

Octopus is overcooked. Feedback to waiter that the meat is tough and he asked if we it needs to be cooked further. Apparently he doesn’t know the basic... the waitress there is very focus on the kitchen and not the diners.
4
A great option in Chijmes without breaking the bank. Food is high quality, although portions are quite small. Service is generally very good, and great range of soft and alcoholic drinks.
4
I would actually give this a 4.5 if I could. Service was good, guacamole was delicious and El Mero Mero enchilada was yummy. Will definitely come back!!
3
Food was not bad but nothing stood out. That said portions were small - not enough for a mains especially for the price they charge.
4
We are regulars at El Mero Mero.
Its always good food and service and a lovely intimate atmosphere when we are there.
5
Came here with the better half, service was excellent and the food was awesome. Love the open kitchen concept, was interesting watching some of the chefs work.
5
My partner and I visited El Mero Mero in January 2018 and we were mesmerized by the atmosphere of the beautiful Chijmes surroundings. Upon entering the restaurant we were greeted by the waitress and seated at a table of our preference and immediately iced water on the tableShortly after taking a seat we were warmly greeted by the manager of the restaurant who was from Iran .He was so friendly towards us that took the time out to speak with us about the restaurant , facilities , surroundings and of cause beautiful Singapore.He is a credit to El Mero Mero due to his wonderful personality, friendliness and professionalism.We will definitely visit again and recommend the restaurant to our friends in Australia

Singapore isn't known for its Mexican food, so out of a handful of passable Mexican restaurants this is a doable one. Set inside the beautiful garden of Chijmes, the service doesn't do the set-up any justice. The waitstaff is all over the place. We had to keep getting up or waving someone down for service. They kept forgetting things like, bringing glasses with the water, or napkins, or sharing plates. We had to ask for everything and repeatedly. We were a party of 5 on a Tuesday evening around 7pm. It was hardly packed. The drinks came at different times, everyone's food came at different times. Just puts a damper on everything. This was our second time there and the service was worse than the first time. Not sure if I'll be in any rush to revisit ESP since there are so many more in the same place with better service.
5
Been to El Mero Mero everytime I’m back to Singapore and craving for good tapas. The food is always excellent and the setting is always perfect. As it’s within Chijmes itself, you get to see the excellent view of the Church when you step out at Night. Great for dates and Long chats with friends
5
I went to El Mero Mero with my two sons on the 31st. Our first time there. The restaurant and it’s succulent Mexican food were recommended by a Mexican lady. The experience was superb: warm welcome, great decoration and music, nice open kitchen. The food and drinks were the best I had in a very long time. Freshness and tastiness of the products, beautiful presentation. We truly live it.
3
The location is great, in particular in the evening and probably the best thing about this place. The mains were at best average, the deserts slightly better. The service was overall ok.
1
Came here for a dinner at 9.30pm. The service staffs are very rude. worst service ever.
Think twice before coming to this place. There are better restaurants out there with awesome service staffs!
4
The quality of the food dropped as compared to my 1st visit. And as there are many Mexican restaurant in Singapore Now, el mero mero price point is on the high side.
5
Really good food and service! The portions were generous and the ambience was really cosy. Love the Arrachera Fajitas!
5
We ended up in this restaurant on New year's eve. We only ordered drinks and an appetizer. Service was very friendly and the food was good. Prices a bit high for Singapore standard but it is worth it. Very nice location and a great place to sit outside
3
Expensive. Food portions are small for amount charged. Their special octopus lacking in flavours, a bit of an over-hyped. Service surprisingly was good.
5
Been here a few times, and its my wife's favorite restaurant. Good for families and/or nights out. Focus on the tacos, all are uniformly good. Other dishes have been hit and miss. Drinks on the expensive side (on par with rest of Chijmes). The artificial grass in front is a nice touch for younger kids
4
Good mexican food. Price is little high. Very good Corona Rita- margarita with corona. Food is rather salty. Nice place to gave dinne
5
Our dinner was stunning. From the service to drinks and food, this is a place to be. We had Cava brut to begin with. Lamb and prawn tempura tacos. Then head chef presented corn street sampler. Pisco sour were served while waiting for our mains. Grilled octopus is so tender and beef fajita is seasoned well. We capped off with pecan pie.
3
Food was good. We ordered Guacamole, Crispy Fish Taco, El MeroMero Quesadilla). I now understand why even the Mexicans enjoy this place. The only item that was disappointing was the Chicken taco (soft taco was soggy). But ingredients were fresh and tasty.Price wise, steep. Expensive for a casual meal unless you are out for a celebration.Service was a bit sad. It wasn't full house and though we could be slightly hidden towards the back of the restaurant, the staff did not look out for us or make frequent visits to our table to see if we needed anything more. Would not have any business meals here if this is their standard of service
4
There are 6 of us came to this restaurant to taste Mexican food during lunch. Atmosphere was nice as there’s no crowd. We are told to be seated outdoor as there’s some renovation work on the day which staff did not informed when making reservation one day before.Food were not bad but pricey for lunch. Overall nice experience to be there
5
Chijmes is a great place - lots of choice of restaurants and an easy walk cab or bus ride to the rest of the main tourist and business areas of Singapore. El Mero Mero was the choice of a local friend for where to eat dinner and chat and it did not disappoint. Sensibly priced, good food, music not too loud, great views and decent service (not too in your face but attentive enough)
1
Devastated, without doubt the worse lunch I have ever had in Singapore. This used to be a favourite venue for me and my team. The service was so bad. The waitress was to busy taking to kitchen staff than serving guests. all 12 of the dishes tasted exactly the same. How would i describe this dining experience “grey”
4
Food was good.. Authentic. But think a bit understaffed, so service can be a bit slow at times. Can improv
3
We had the Atlantic grilled octopus and the fajitas. Both were quite tough but the flavour was pretty decent
5
i am a foodie but the drinks here just too special not to try ! love the presentation of the food and the drinks - thumbs up to the chef and the bartender. love the ambience and deco the guacamole is too yummy so please order this mexican food is it know for little I am still hungry after the dinner - hahhahaha very centralised location at cityhall MRT - Chijmes pric
3
Good ambience n deco. Cozy place to eat. But food is only average. Guacomole is good. But salsa is not nice. And the tacos is under flavore
5
We are so glad to find this Mexican restaurant in Singapore- it's in a great location- near Raffles Hotel and the local metro station. We liked the casual atmosphere and being able to sit outdoors. As we are originally from California/ USA, our meal here felt like a taste of home. The homemade tortillas were soft and light; the tortilla chips were thin and crispy; the ceviche we tried was pure heaven; the tacos may have been simple but they had great, great flavor. If we were at home, we would have added queso Fresca to the top as well as fresh cilantro and maybe fresh tomato salsa. The margaritas were the best bar margaritas we've tried!! All in all, a truly rememorable Mexican meal
4
The food is very fresh. The presentation is very nice. But the place is georgeous.Price are expensive , we paid 100sgd for 3 starters, 2 drinks and one dessert. This is Chjimes
4
good mexican food in town, tacos are great, ceviches too. I will come back for sure one day, good experienc
3
Went for lunch but did not eat as did not like the menuNice place in great location but to many changes to classic dishes in the menuHad a drink and left, service was good and stafffriendl
4
Mexican would never be my first choice but I came away from here very impressed. Three of us ordered different Taco dishes, one prawn, one chicken and one fish, each came with 3 portions so perfect for sharing. We all enjoyed every mouthful.Prices were reasonable for the location at Chijme
4
Second time at this modern restaurant with serving delicious contemporary mexican cusine. We went early and chose to eat indoors. For the price range of the restaurant and the atmosphere they were going for, service was alright but could have been better. (E.g. Instead of asking first before clearing the plates, our server moved in to do so while she asked. She was also rather sulky.
4
Food came quickly and was interesting flavours. We took our kids 9 and 12. Food is less suited to them. Interior a little dark. Service efficient but not overly helpful
3
Average plus... The truth is that the food at El Mero Mero is not bad, but unfortunately it does not even come close to what the food was like a year ago. You can't even compare it... even though it is the same menu!! The wild fish ceviche used to be unbelievable, I used to crave it and just go there for lunch during the week just to be able to order this. Today the plating is different, the sauce is different and the taste does not compare... it's just okay now. It is nothing you will crave nor want to go back there just so you can have it again. The portions used to be more generous. The sizes were never huge, but the amount of fish on the fish tacos is about 1/3 less of what it was a year ago... Now, they are small portions. It's almost as if they are trying to save money, even the onions have shrunk in size. A year ago I could not eat 3 tacos because 2 was just enough. Today my 12 year old ate 3 tacos and came home hungry. The value, the presentation is just not there anymore. We used to love getting the spicy popcorn on the chicken tacos. Today there was "popcorn powder" (gross) as indicated by the waitress... it just does not look the same. Plus, the chicken came with the skin and it was all soft, which changes the texture of the meal. Needless to say those tacos were picked apart and were barely eaten. I am truly heart broken as this used to be our favourite casual dinning spot to go to in Singapore. Unfortunately we will not be going back anytime soon. I understand the restaurant is under new management but with the same owner. I wish the owner would realize what is going on in his restaurant and do everything possible to either bring back the old management, or understand what the old management was doing right and do it again... today, what used to be a gorgeous and delicious experience is nothing but mediocre... SO SO sad
5
We had the nachos with salsa, wild fish ceviche, wild fish and prawn tacos - excellent. Compliments to Victor and team. Compliments to Isabel & Aziz - 6 star service. Compliments to the bartenders too for the excellent margaritas- I had 3
4
Second time here. Food is prepared well. Service staff are friendly and helpful. Pleasant dining experience overall :
5
I had visited here alone, on a solo business trip, about six months ago and was back in town for the 2017 Grand Prix with my wife. I told her that this was a Mexican restaurant "with a difference" and we both love the atmosphere at CHIJMES anyway.....We started with the Ceviches, which were delicious and I was struggling with my main course choice when Rahamat suggested I choose different items from the Tacos menu...what a great idea.....I had the Wild Fish, the Spanish pork and I can't remember the third one, but they were all delicious.It was a very busy weekend but Rahamat was in no hurry, happy to recommend different dishes and took his time to make sure my wife and I were happy with our choices. His colleagues were all attentive, professional and nothing was too much trouble.I would thoroughly recommend this restaurant for "Mexican with a twist
3
I went for lunch prior to this and loved it. As such, I had planned to visit the restaurant again in future for dinner. However, when I revisted at dinner a couple of months later, the experience was entirely different and disappointing. The food took a long time to arrive. The beef fajita was tough (unlike when I had it for lunch) and the lamb was very gamey with a strong and sour tasting sauce which I didnt take it
2
Wow. Just stay away from Chijmes, if you know what's good for you. I've yet to visit any restaurant here that is worth the exorbitant prices charged. So I was on a mission to find the best Mexican food in Singapore. It's not here. First of all, there was some terrible live music outside in the courtyard dining area (shared by all the restaurants on the interior ring of Chijmes), so I sat inside. The best thing about the restaurant is that I really liked the plates. Nice ceramics. I ordered a margarita. It was good. I also ordered the "Classic Green Enchiladas", which were presented to me in a salsa SOUP. Yes, they were drenched in liquid, and sprinkled with some herbs, which I guess one is supposed to savour and let the flavours roll around and frolic in one's mouth, but for god's sake, this was a soggy tortilla, with some mildly seasoned chicken, in a soup of salsa verde. It tasted OK enough that I ate it all (cause I was monster-hungry). I would say the enchiladas were worth $12 USD, which would be S$15, but instead cost S$28. I will not return
4
We like to dine at chijmes. Lunch with the greenery and elegant white buildings or dinner with warm and cozy lights

What a disaster of a restaurant. We booked a table through Chope. When we arrived we were greeted rather grumpily by one of the staff and shown to our table. We placed an order for appetizers (which are really overpriced) and one main dish to 'start with'. We had the crispy fish tacos which are priced at something like $14 for the two and we struggled to find the fish. Meanwhile our drinks order didn't arrive. We had been in the restaurant about 35 minutes before our drinks arrived. At this point we were asked if we were waiting on any more food to which we informed the waitress yes and what was outstanding. Oh and by the way we were still waiting for some water we had ordered some 45 minutes beforehand. At this point there were also a number of tables surrounding us for which the patrons had left but it seemed beneath the waiting staff to clear them. So we were surrounded by at least 4 dirty tables. Finally nearly an hour in to our experience the rest of our food arrived which was stone cold. We requested to speak to the manager who apologised and offered a free dessert, which we didn't want as we hadn't really had a main course. We said our date night for the two of us which doesn't happen often had been ruined. They offered to take the food off the bill but eventually agreed that we didn't need to pay for anything but wished that we would come back again. Will never return. It is a shame as this restaurant is in the heart of Chijmes and will not leave the right lasting impression on any tourist or local visitor. Date of visit: 26 August 2017

Beautiful restaurant and ambience. The food was good, but expensive. We wouldn't mind returning, but the aloof service staff tells us that our money's better spent elsewhere
4
We had tacos to share. Food was good and unique. Live band was playing at the lawn, so the ambience was quite nice then
3
The octopus leg and beef /bone marrow tacos were delightful. Suckling pig, dorper lamb and beef burrito were below my expectation on taste and I am not one that set high expectations for food.
4
very good Mexican food in town even if it is not a cheap place. Some of their dishes are really good.
3
Went with a couple of friends for a late lunch during a weekday. A section of the restaurant was closed off. The place we were told to sit in was quite tight and seats hard. Not particularly comfy. My friend ordered a spiced Mexican beer. Oh, tasted awful. Like medicine. The main dishes were really expensive in relation to portion size and quality. The tacos were $30+ for 3 pieces. And small. The flavor was ok. But it's much too expensive. We were hungry after that. The beef and kurobuta pork taco were well flavored but not satisfying. The burrito was also $30+ but the portion size bigger and came with some chips. Taco had no chips on the side. The staff were just abit curt. Not unfriendly or rude but not warm either. Ambience is so so more like a bar. Would I go back? Frankly no. High price. Small portions. Ok flavor. Normal atmosphere. Nothing to push me back there.
5
I don't normally associate Mexican food with fine dining but they bring this about at El Mero Mero. The taco was delicious but the enchiladas stole the show and the suckling pig was also excellent. An extensive drinks menu adds to the fun and the service was outstanding. Well worth trying and the al fresco setting is superb also
3
I liked the outdoor seatings with a view of the garden lawn and lighted trees. CHIJMES is a beautiful place to hang out in the evening and El Mero Mero has prime spot. Decent selection of wines but food could have been better especially the dessert - their churros was flaccid and disappointing.
3
Had the burrito and enchiladas and both were very average, and for the price u would expect a lot more, especially with the quality of the ingredients. Positives is the ambience of the place
4
Always a great time at el mero mero. We had the octopus, burrito and signature cerviche and drink with sangria. Fantastic. Come for the happy Hour! Worth the price.
4
Came here for dinner, and the staff kindly fit us in for a table when it was already very crowded. The guacamole here is awesome, but I did want a little more as we ran out about three quarters full. The enchilada was nice, the plate did feel a bit empty, but that might have been because it was very filling. All in all, a great place to try if you feel like something different
5
Found this restaurant via The Entertainer app, and booked via Chope! Experience turned out to be a delightful one as service was prompt, efficient and unobtrusive. We had the Octopus, Fajitas and Wild Grilled Fish Tacos. Enjoyed all the dishes equally! Value for money, especially with the Entertainer voucher. Will highly recommend
3
Billed as a Mexican Restaurant, the food served seems like a far cry from that. It is a very westernized version of what should be Mexican food. Nothing at all on the plate resemble Mexican food. While the food was ok, service poor,, and the prices a bit on the expensive side, the sad part is the let down on the expectation of eating Mexican and getting something else, perhaps a Chef's creative vision. Didn't help that the staff got the order wrong on 2 out of 4 items, and the nachos never came. Not at all recommended if you want Mexican food.
4
Like the variety of Mexican food there and was pleasant that we got to try the sauce of the food first to see if it's tailored to our tastebuds. Love the drinks
4
Birthday celebration for my friend on a monday night. Staff recommendation is good however we did mention that we are using the entertainer app for this and the staff forget about this. So we actually reminded the staff on this. Other than that the staff is quite attentive
4
My daughters had selected the restaurant for my birthday based on online reviews. But for one reason or another, we didn't get to go there. My younger Daughter decided that for her 18th birthday. A fantastic recommendation. Only 2 of us as mummy and Jie Jie were away. The staff were attentive with their service and arranged for the band performing in the grounds outside the restaurant to sing a birthday song. Food wise, we have no complaint except compliment. Had 2 tacos, one enchilada and steak. If not for the sangria lacking in the punch due to too little alchol, it would HC a 5 star rating. Cheers
4
The tacos selection was very delicious, I had one with pork, pickled onions and jalapeÃ±o- super! It was came with a dressing on the side that made me want more! My hubby had the octopus and he literally cleaned his plate - the sauce they used was very unique tasting. They were packed and so it was good that we made a reservation. It was sometimes a challenge to get their attention as they were very busy.
4
I booked this place for an early dinner with friends and it did not disappoint! :-) We started with a few cocktails and I must say their Mojito is the bomb! It's so good.. for food we ordered a bunch of tacos to share. The beef tenderloin was so soft, juicy and very tasty. The grilled fish taco was very good too. I'll be back with some friends again next time. It's a good place to just chill and hang out
3
Great Ambience, food was average and slightly pricey, fish was slightly overcooked. Drinks were good.
4
Restaurant close at 230pm. Lunch hours quieter than evening and good place for meeting. Food is nice.
4
Nice mex restaurant in chimes with a big terrace. Their margarita-rita mixing with corona is delicious. Nice mex tapas and typical plates.
5
I like the mushroom taco and the cheese stick. It's very delicious n filling as a dinner. Very cosy romantic interior settings. Staffs are very attentive n polite.
4
Had dinner on a Friday night and it was relatively busy. Service was alittle slow but the food and atmosphere made up for it. Suckling pig was roasted to perfection with thin crisp skin with soft tender meat. Mushroom and pork tacos are uniquely different and good.
2
Great ambience but that's largely due to Chijmes. Food was very very so-so. Service wasn't great. I wouldn't recommend it
5
Love the Tacos & Dessert we had for lunch (please keep cinnamon ice cream on the menu).Great ambience and privacy - high ceilings, views of the lawn
5
Our second visit to this great resturant located at an excellent location. Quiet music show outside of the resturant, great service, delicious and surprising dishes (every dish we have tried) and as a bonus, a friendly chat with the chef, who is carefully preparing and decorating every dish which coming out of this kitchen. We will visit again, soon!
2
It was really nice to seat outside and sip some wine, however the food was disaster. I ordered a lamb dish while my fiancÃ© had the beef burrito. The lamb sauce was way too salty. The burrito was oily and the beef was quite chewy.
4
lovely place with a nice atmosphere. Service staff are attentive. The food is relatively fresh and tasteful.
4
Great food and a really fantastic setting. The service was slightly less than great but it didn't matter too much. I'd like to go back and try everything on the menu!
3
We were looking for a place to have dinner after visiting the museum, and decided to try El Mero Mero. We ordered the Roasted Dorper Lamb and Arrachera Fajitas. We found the portions to be small as we were still hungry after our meal (which cost us S$61.20). Nontheless, the ambiance was nice and the staff were polite
4
This is not a typical mexican food that you would expect. Nice food decoration and taste enlightened my taste buds
3
For starter we ordered Tiger prawn ceviche which I thought was quite pleasant. My friend order premium lamb for his main but it was quite disappointing, the lamb was dry and the sauce was meh. The rest of us ordered Al pastor and lamb tacos, they were all average. As for the dessert, churros with chocolate was ok, chocolate was quite diluted in my opinion
4
The best things we had that night were the Creative cocktails and lovely Mexican tapas! I have never had such Creative dishes before! We sat at the counter and the Chef was Super interactive.
5
We ordered the namesake ceviche, fajitas and wild fish taco. Best decision ever. My fav would be the ceviche. Yum! Service was attentive as well.
4
Good food experience. And we were lucky to have a rock band playing outside. Located in Chijmes, it also makes the restaurant a special place. We like the octopus and the beef
5
Great attentive service, yummy food and , creative service.The music was great. Only negative was the band playing on the lawn was way too loud
1
It used be my favorite restaurant at chijmes. Not anymore from today. I brought my business partner for lunch. At the beginning , there was one small fly flying over our table. I secretly killed it before my business partner noticed . soon there were two or three flies..I tried to brush them away but it didn't help.. I told the staff but she said sorry but she didn't do much about it. I was very embarrassed in front of business partner. I expect a cleaner setting here.
4
Atmosphere was really nice with soft and warm lighting and pretty furnishings. Food had unusual flavours which were a delight. However, serving time was longer than expected taking close to 45 to serve as all 4 dishes came out at the same time. Staff was not unfriendly but did not put on a smile and seemed slightly impatient when taking orders or billing us. A little on the pricier side but still worth it for the tastes and experience.
2
Used to be a big fan but yesterday I noticed some differences. The so called appetizers used to be small and light but this one was heavy. The mero mero enchilada tasted dry and for the first time in my 60 year life I did not finish an enchilada. The french chef is no longer there and I guess this brought down the quality
5
Our whole experience was great! The food was exceptional, I loved everything I ordered. The ambience was nice and cozy too.
4
Service of the place is not too bad. Initially the restaurant did not record down my reservation, but they still managed to get us a table quickly. Food is generally good.
5
Excellent food accompanied by nice drinks, and the ambiance was nice too! The waiters were knowledgeable about the menu and the open kitchen concept was delightful and entertaining in itself.
2
Ordered the roasted mutton, dry and unappetizing, I finished only half of it. Suckling pig was too salty.
4
Strategically located at Chijmes. One of my favourite dining place. Short walking distance from city hall
4
Been here quite a few times. Good happy hour deals on drinks, great tapas style Mexican food. The guacamole is particularly good. Staff friendly and helpful.
3
When we arrived (we have eaten here before) we wanted to sit outside. I asked the only waitress on staff if sitting outside was ok, and it was like she did not even hear me. She started to escort me to a seat inside the facility. After we cleared that up, she brought us menus and disappeared for 10 minutes. It always felt like we were putting her at an inconvenience. She drop food in my wife's lap. If not for the food my rating would be a 1. Ceviche was excellent and the tacos the same. Work on training your staff. Won't eat here again because of it.Server was April
1
My first time here with friends. Food was disappointing ie. the pork tacos & the lamb from the mains were far too dry and the churros tasted too doughy - definitely tasted better ones elsewhereWhat made this our first and last visit was because of the horrible customer service. When the waiter gave us our menus, we asked him which items that we can use for The Entertainer and at the same time he mentioned that there was an offer for 30% off tacos. However, he didn't state that the discount is not applicable when we use the Entertainer. When the bill came, they refused to give us both the offers and the waiter argued that he did in fact say that we couldn't combine the usage of both although we were so sure he didn't. We had to insist that we specifically asked right at the beginning, and after many arguments, we just paid and left because we just couldn't deal with them.The waiter and waitress in charge were just rude and not even apologetic about misinforming us. Will never step foot here again. Only redeeming point is the ambience. Not worth your money and time

We went there as it was close to fairmont where we were staying. The staff were lovely and attentive. It hid been pouring all afternoon so we chose to eat inside. My daughter loved her quesadilla and we enjoyed the tacos. Great location and great ambience.
3
Hard to get served when you sit outside, even when they are not so busy. Food was just okay, nothing special, could be so much better and more authentic
5
Had the Old Chicano, which is my favourite. Amongst my fellow diners, the wild fish tacos and the Kurobuta pork tacos, were very well received.
5
This is the second time I have eaten at this restaurant and didn't disappoint. The food is sensational, service very good and friendly.
4
Service was good and the staff was very attentive. Our fave 2 dishes were the octopus and the el mero mero enchiladas.
5
The food here is just amazing. Fresh, packed with taste and new modern recipes. Be sure to try the cheese volcano. Best Mexican food I've ever had.
3
atmosphere was great, nice outdoor seating and reasonably priced drinks. The food was average and so was the service.
4
One of the best Mexican restaurants around. Food was exquisite but the staff could be more friendly
5
I visited El Mero Mero on the 1st of April 2017 to celebrate my gf's birthday, and she was craving Mexican. Their service was extremely efficient and food was served fresh and quick. I also requested for a surprise birthday cake under my Chope reservation and the server took note of it without having me to mention it. The mexican food was also fresh and good. All in all, pretty much a perfect mexican dining experience and i was really pleased
3
Service could have been friendlier, prompter. Had a vibe that they wanted to go people in and out to make the table quota for the night. Otherwise food was pretty good
3
Food was reasonable but during a World Gourmet Summit you expect more from the guest chef. It was a fixed menu as this is always the case in the WGS program. Probably it was also some of the meat that was not my cuppa: pork shoulder and especially the beef cheek. Again, it was not bad but not my favorite flavors.
5
My partner and I were lucky enough to travel to Singapore during the Gourmet Food Summit, March 2017. The Mezcal Masterclass at El Mero Mero turned out to be one of the many wonderful highlights of our trip.The 5 course meal was truly delicious, each dish matched with an appropriate Mezcal (and one Tequila) and an intimate discussion of the magic behind the Agave spirits, and their deep roots in Mexican culture. Great people, great food. El Mero Mero = "the best of the best"
4
Food served was good - unique taste to everything. Beef Burritto was awesome. However, it is a little too pricey.
5
Slightly expensive, but the quality of the food is excellent. The service was excellent. Went there for a team dinner and it was good fun all around.
5
Authentic. The ambience is great. Service attentive. Cuisine takes it to another level. Don't expect Tex-mex. This is the real thing. Awesome
4
Very nice ambience for couple to relax and enjoy the food. Food is quite small portion. Not really value for money. But taste and flavor indeed is good!
3
Food was ok. Not expensive, had 4 dishes. 2 mains, 1 soup, 1 appetisier. Virgin mojito was very sour.
5
Good recommendations from the manager and service was good. My wife enjoyed the food very much, we will definitely be back soon
5
I had the pleasure of having lunch here late last year and dinner last night along with a Tequila pairing which was rather interesting. Keep in mind that as Mexico is an incredibly large and diverse country, there is no one cuisine and food varies enormously not only from region to region but from one town to another. That being said, I felt that this restaurant has taken many local favourites and elevated them. A good example is seeing pork meat replaced by Kurobuta Pork! The result is divine and well worth a try. Don't forget to try out some of their great selection of Tequila or Mescal
4
Visited this restaurant at Chijmes for a company meeting. El Mero Mero offers outdoor dining options and a Mexican spread. Good quality food and large portion sizes - which was impressive. I liked their fries - far apart and better from other places. Definitely a must visit. Will only recommend the restaurant to increase the number of vegetarian options.
4
This has to be the third or fourth time that we've visited El Mero Mero. The food is always superb and tastes fantastic. The only thing that let us down was the service. The waiting staff were not attentive to us at all and it seemed as if we were being ignored. However, when it came to pay the over $1000 bill, the staff were pushing us and couldn't get the money fast enough. Nonetheless, each time we have been before (where we sat inside) the service has been good. Something must have been off, but once again, the food was excellent. We shall be back soon
4
The food was good and special, hardly find nice Mexican meal in Singapore. There were both indorr and outdoor seats to choose from. Outdoor seating comes with live busking, while indoor has its romantic ambiance. However there some several small flies flying around, which might be abit irritating
2
Not at all what you expect from a mexican restaurant.
The location just perfect, service perfect, but the dishes are not overwhelming!
Really expensive for what is being served
4
Surprisingly delicious food and good service!
Their El Mero Mero cocktail is on the strong side ;)
Will visit again
5
We ordered the spinach pig 'carnitas' taco and veal & oxtail tacos were real flavourful. The Angus fajitas was tender and tasty too. The staff were also friendly.
4
Impeccable food & service. My girlfriends and I were very impressed with every single dish (there was 6 dishes) that was presented to us
5
Just had a lovely Black Angus ribeye steak with grilled vegetables and paired it with their house pour cabernet sauvignon. Had dessert wine with my choc ice cream.Loving it!
Thank you
Keep up the good work guys
Two thumbs up
4
We were two families (8 persons) who had dinner at Mero Mero and we were all satisfied. The food was good and prices reasonable. The atmosphere was also nice, so, in all, we were really happy with the dinner and the service.
4
This is the second time we have dinner at this restaurant. The foods is good and the location is excellent. Very relaxing and enjoyable. We had guacamole which was good the red snapper ceviche which was outstanding.
5
The food at El Mero Mero was fantastic. I had the fish tacos and my husband had the primerib. The fish was delicious. My husband loved the flavor of the prime rib but would have loved the rib served whole. The chips and gucamole were wonderful! The cost of the meal was a little pricey, but it was well worth it. We will return
3
Suckling Pig, Beef Fajitas and the smoked Corn starter. The beef was super chewy the use skirt which if cooked right can be awesome, but this wasn't The suckling pig was spicy but my wife found a Vein/Artery in is which put her right off.There needs to be an option of sides or them included as the fajitas was served with a creamy onion sauce but no Guacamole, the Pork came with a sauce and a couple of bits of dried pineapple. The starter was the most interesting dish.Will I be back, No
3
I spent a couple months in Mexico City on exchange and am usually pretty critical of the stuff Singapore passes as Mexican Food (ex the sour cream and cheddar laden "quesadillas" at Cha Cha Cha). I was pretty skeptical of this place when my parents suggested it for dinner, but the food really is authentic. Tacos al Pastor were a staple of mine in MX, and this restaurant's rendition really delivered. Perfectly seasoned meat on fresh tortillas with the customary accompaniment of pineapple and onion. Fantastic. The guac wasn't great but that's not really Mexican food so not calling a foul there. Dessert churros and my parents' entrees were also delicious. The restaurant has an extensive cocktail menu, and the margaritas we sampled were divine. All of this was almost entirely undone by truly horrific service. The waiter's failure to bring three glasses of water for the thirty minutes we had to wait before even ordering was a taste of what was to come. Our appetizer of guac came about 10 minutes after ordering, as did the first round of drinks. The subsequent food did not come until an hour and a half later (at 10 PM mind you), though our waterless waiter kept saying "five more minutes" every time we hit another ten minute mark. We frequently debated cancelling our order and moving to literally any other restaurant, but false promises of soon-to-come food kept us there. The food eventually came (and the manager graciously attended to my furious parents), but the water had no such fate. Maybe it was a ploy to increase spending on alcohol? If that was the case, it definitely worked, seeing as my parched family ended up downing a good number of drinks to wash down the salty fare in front of us. All this left me thoroughly confused. The food was great and the manager kind and apologetic, but our dinner experience was honestly terrible because of how hungry and hopeless we were for most of it. The actual moments we spent eating were sullied by the anger of the moments spent waiting, all of which chalked up to a pretty subpar three-star evening. TLDR: Only go here if you're down to weather a questionably long wait time.
4
The ambience is trendy but cozy, and the wait staff are super attentive. The entrees are okay, but to make it more interesting, order drinks with appetizers to share. Having a one-for-one coupon from a dining app makes it worth it.
3
Staff was attentive. Food was decent. Enjoyed the fish tacos. The kurobuta pork tacos were too salty.
4
The ambience was good, but there is scope of improvement for the food and the value for money! Also, there were quite a bit of mosquitoes, which should be taken care of.
5
OMG, their tacos are amazing! I ordered the Spanish Pig Carnitas and NZ Angus Beef Tenderloin tacos and I couldn't choose between the two - melt in your mouth bursting with flavour and so, so, so utterly tender.Their El Mero Mero Ceviche (octopus, prawns, wild fish, spiced tomato sauce, avocado, lime) was good but not mind blowing the way the tacos were. We were two people so after 4 tacos (2 each) and sharing the ceviche, we couldn't have one main each so we shared the Arrachera A.K.A Fajitas (250g black angus flank steak, poblano, shishito, burnt onion cream). It was very, very good. We also knew that we were going to order their Tequila Pecan Pie (with cinnamon ice cream) which was the main purpose in going to El Mero Mero.They also do a daily happy hour from 12:30 - 7:30 p.m
4
Mexican food is always a fav to the taste buds. This one does not fail either. If you want to dine at a slightly touristy place for your out-of-town visitors, this one in Chijmes is a great choice. Al Fresco tables with breeze is not too bad. The famous beer over margarita is a bit diluted though. Only good for pictures.
5
After living in Mexico City for 3 years and becoming obsessed with the food and the culture, I've become a bit of a snob when it comes to Mexican dinning. Tonight I found a must in Singapore: El Mero Mero. Not only does it offer traditional Mexican cuisine with a gourmet twist, but it also manages to share more of Mexican culture with the wildly cosmopolitan Singapore. The margaritas and fish tacos are exceptional, and the service leaves nothing to be desired. Amazing experience and I highly recommend it!
4
Service staff was great. They were smiley and was quick to attend to us. The enchiladas was delicious ! It would be good if happy hours promotions were extended to entertainer users.. we would have gone for a couple of glasses instead, and that would probably make up for the entertainer promotions?.
1
Over the years I have been to El Mero Mero and had a decent time with drinks and food. OK its not super authentic Mexican although its been reasonably good food and its in a nice spot to hang out with family or friends.Well that seems to have ALL CHANGED!We were at El Mero Mero on a sat night at around 8.30pm and had some starters and drinks and i have to say it was all very very average. Then we had a couple of different soft tacos and a burrito. The tacos all tasted strange, we were hungry and ate them although they didn't taste like they should. The burrito seems to have been deep fried and was just AWFUL!! We had one small bite we left it.Got the check and just about fell off my chair, no questions from the staff on why food was left so we paid and left for the absolute LAST TIME as were never coming back. Actually on the way home i said i think we would have had better food at McDonald's than we had at El Mero Mero and I don't even eat McDonalds!
4
We ordered the lamb and the burrito dishes and both were very delicious. The ambiance was nice to chill out with friends after work. Service staff was very friendly and helpful. When we ordered guacamole to go, we were given specific instructions on how we should go about serving the guacamole at home - they went the extra mile. Overall, a wonderful experience at El Mero Mero!
3
Visited with a friend for dinner and the results were pretty mixed. The guacamole was very good with a bit of texture and the el Mero Mero ceviche was also very good. The veal tongue and oxtail taco was delicious. The bluefin tuna tostada was OK but the Arrachera Fajitas is a bit of a mess of a dish. A bit too rich and heavy. Cocktails were good as was the bottle of white Rioja. The service let's the place down. It wasn't particularly busy and there were plenty of staff around but seemingly not interested in the detail of clearing away empty glasses, topping up water or providing fresh cutlery for a new dish once the original cutlery had been cleared away. The service let el mero mero down and whilst the good was good, the overall experience was pretty average
2
This was one of our favourite restauarants in Singapore but after our recent visit it has been removed from that list. The service was appalling, food was far below normal and we will not be back.
5
Perfect location next to the chijmes church, in the middle of singapores colonial centre,a lot of ambiance on a Friday night, cocktails awesome, staff realy friendly and helpful, nice Mexican food with a very inspiring touch,as desert churro s with chocolate, certainly will go back!
3
We were here 2 months ago and the food and service was great. Tonight the dishes arrived a long way apart and the quality just wasn't at the same level, disappointing.
3
good vibe, yummy drinks, nice presentation, but not the top of my list in terms of mexican food. :) if you are using entertainer, you can only use the app for one main per bill.
4
Love the food and the service rendered! Recommended Ceviche of the day (Crabmeat) was delightful. Mains (Suckling Pig and Stewed Beef) were good though a tad salty. Service was excellent and thoughtful. Worth a return visit.
5
Rarely can you find good authentic Mexican food in this part of the world. This meal surpassed my expectations. The location of the restaurant is also in a good place that is easy to get to.
4
Visited for an early dinner, had pork tacos, Atlantic Grilled Octopus and the Angus Beef Burrito. Food was decent--good portions and satisfying, although we felt the octopus was slightly overhyped. Service was attentive.
2
Definitely lots of areas for improvement.
Wait staff were not very informed when it came to giving recommendations for food/drinks and the food was not worth the price.
4
The food here is good as well as interesting and the outdoor setting at Chijmes is very pleasant. Try the huitlacoche donuts with the mini-elote (amazing) or the crunchy fish tacos. They also make a nice guacamole. Not everything is great: the tempura shrimp is bland and too sweet and the beer selection is surprisingly small and boring given how many good beers come out of Mexico. Service is hit or miss; some nights they are really on top of things, others they are really distracted even when it's not busy. But if you are looking for an authentic Mexican meal in Singapore, this is a good choice
3
I booked through Chope and the offer for cash voucher discount came up so i bought some. I was aware of the limitation to use on happy hour and asked the waitress if we could order drinks and meals separately, if not, then will just not use the voucher. We ordered the drinks and the waitress said she needed to ask the manager which was fair, but it took her a long time to come back... like 15 minutes... when we asked again, we got told to wait, manager is busy... then we said it's okay, we will just not use the voucher. After we started to order food which is like more than 20 minutes since we first ordered our drinks, we asked if our drinks were ready... then got to told the order was never put in…the food and ambiance was great, but I expected better service… I still have to go back at some stage to use the voucher i purchased…
4
The food was very good and generally it's the seafood! The fish tacos are very delicious and the octopus as well. We only didn't like the pork taco so maybe you can skip that dish.
5
Great food in a very good location. Pricey but worth it-- one of the best mexican rest in se asia-- authentic
4
Was surporised to have true-to-life Mexican food in Singapore. the taste and quality is authentic! We enjoyed hand mixed margaritas, guacamole and tacos de carnitas and al pastor. A real treat!
5
I had the wild ceviche and veal and oxtail tacos. Both were incredible. Some of the best Mexican I've eaten.
4
I never like Mexican food till I had my dinner there ...I like the corn sampler and the grilled Octopus. Must try the classic Margaritas too...
1
My first time hereon a weekend public holiday, the service was awesome which was the reason I came back a second time. However, during the second visit, the service was really disappointing and my company left with a bad taste in our mouths. Prior to arriving, I made an online reservation, when I entered the restaurant, the service staff didn't even bother checking and just asked 'where do you want to seat'. Food is just average for the price. We proceeded to asked the service staff the items that we can use for The Entertainer as well as the items for Happy Hour drinks. They didn't state that Happy Hour prices is not applicable when we use the Entertainer. Lo and behold, when the bill came, the drinks were exorbitantly priced. They refused to give us the Happy Hour prices for the drinks and argued that we didn't asked them if we could combine the usage of both. We had to insist that we specifically asked right at the beginning, and after many arguments, they only allowed 2 drinks to be given the happy hour prices
5
Came here for dinner with the family on Tuesday. We weren't planning to order tacos however they were so good that we kept wanting more tacos. I reckon we had 4 out of the (I think 7 or 8 types) and we were not disappointed. You have to have the fish and prawn tacos. Thank you Damian, Jannie and team for looking after us.
5
Visiting over the Halloween weekend was an added bonus due to the amiable personnel being dressed up for the occasion!The fare on hand was simply superb, from the Wild Fish ceviche, pollo enchiladas and the melt in your mouth Lamb entrÃ©e, all in all spectacular!
5
My Gf and I are foodies. It was our one year anniversary so I had to choose the restaurant. I didn't not expect anything when I walked in. But I left the restaurant extremely impressed with the food and service. Thank to them,it was a perfect date
5
This was my second time visiting El Mero Mero and I'm sure it won't be the last. I had a Margarita as an aperitif, shared with my co-diners the El Mero Mero Ceviche, Tiger Prawn Ceviche, Carnitas Tacos, Roaster Dorper Lamb Tacos, Grilled Octopus, Roasted Suckling Pig, and Arrachera, followed by a dessert of Braised Pineapple. Not a single dish was anything short of fantastic
2
The service staff was willing to recommend food and drinks to us and we're very helpful throughout our whole experience at the restaurant.
5
We had a very nice time. The manager Damon took real good care of us as well as our waitress. The food is wonderful. The atmosphere is great.
3
The grilled octopus was delicious. The dorper lamb, which is roasted for 8 hours, was dry and disappointing.
Other dishes did not impress.
An overpriced restaurant but nice ambience.
5
The food was pretty authentic and it was nice seeing the chefs at work. Good service too. Will definitely return.
5
as if you are in Mexico! Quality of the food and service are incomparable though sometimes the A/C are not as cold but generally still okay!
4
Great food and ambience! Excellent service! Great place to go for all mexican food lovers, definitely must try their tacos.
2
The food was subpar; fish taco was too soggy with the sauce dripping all over, the 3 bestseller mains as recommended by the server was nothing to should about -suckling pig, octopus and ribeye. It's the first time we were not asked how we wanted the beef done. It rained out of a sudden as we were seated outdoors, and clearly, the restaurant was overwhelmed when they had 30 ppl crowding around the sidewalk. Worst-case-scenarios like this should have been thought of in the first place, and Plan B put in place. We paid the bill of $240 for 3, and left quickly though it's supposed to be a birthday celebration. Didn't bother to stay for desserts.
4
I went there with a group of friends and we were not disappointed. The food is very nicely presented, super tasty and yummy. We tried the octopus, which was super tender, soft tacos, which were very flavorful and a mole chicken dish which was very surprising. It is a modern Mexican restaurant with a twist. Highly recommended for food lovers
5
Where do I start? Everything about El Mero Mero was exceptional. Lets start with our Server Jenny. She is what every employer dreams of hiring. Friendly, professional, patient, tentative, attention to details, interactive, and a beautiful smile. A true asset to the El Mero Mero staff. The Kitchen is open to view from the part of the restaurant we sat in. Which was a nice touch. The chefs were outstanding and laughed at us and rightfully so. Yes chef Jenny had that correct 3 more orders of Guacamole after the first order! The decor and facilities tasteful were spotless. All around I can say in words how good El Mero Mero and their staff is. In my opinion if you are looking for Mexican food in Singapore look now further this is the place. A big thank you to everyone at El Mero Mero and a job well done. We will be back
5
Came to El Mero Mero for lunch and sat outside under the trees in the sunshine. They had a fan mister on, which was refreshing. We shared a variety of food, which included the crunchy fish tacos, korotbuta pork tacos and the Angus beef burrito - all the food was fresh and very tasty. There was also happy hour, therefore we also had a variety of selected cocktails and beers. Highly recommend this restaurant.
5
Real mexicana food and drinks. Service and atmosphere were great too. We will be back for sure. Taste of heaven!!
3
Food was very good but we were far from stuffed for the bill we had in the end. Drinks are expensive and location is very nice. Don't go there to eat a lot.
5
As a Mexican is always difficult to find authentic cuisine specially in Asia. I love the atmosphere, food and drinks! Great terrace! The Mole is to die for!
4
Birthday weekend with family, Enjoyed our dinner, food & cocktails were great. We have added issue when dining of a family member with a food allergy. Our questions about allergens in the menu were answered without issue. This made for an easy & worry free dining experience
4
We went to Chijmes on a Friday evening and walked in without reservations. Had a pitcher of their signature margarita , along with grilled chicken tacos. Good stuff but nothing extraordinary. The 'street corn sampler' (roasted baby corn with donuts) was great though, an Instagram worthy appetizer. Prices were on a higher side for drinks and mains
5
The staff is knowledgeable (and very friendly).The kitchen crew is passionate.The ingredients are fresh and full of taste.An ideal combination.We (quite ignorantly) thought the Mexican kitchen offered taco's, enchiladas and a whole lot of beans. El Mero Mero has taught us that there is so much more to experience. And even the freshly-made-at-your-table guacamole is so fresh, you'll fall in love with this usual suspect.We spent the evening enjoying a Tasting Menu. The chef came by to explain what ingredients were used and how the meal was prepared. This obviously added to the whole experience.You can choose to sit inside and enjoy the open kitchen.Or be seated outside in Chijmes' courtyard.Whatever you choose, you'll surely have an incredibly tasteful evening
1
My gorgeous 5 yo turning 6 wanted mexican for dinner. His was edible because he had been swimming for foyr hours prior to. New to singapore i liked the area live at raffles and they usually givexme recommendations. This time i chose myself how wrong i could be!!!! From the minute we arrived-crappy service (the kind where you wait for a' wobbly' table ) then teenagers talk amongst themselves and dont make eye contact when your don just needs to know where the bathroom is.....grrrrrI asked for three different things they didnt have them. Bottomline service was horrible, staff entitled and rude, food dry and sub par
3
A friend recommended El Mero Mero so maybe our standards were a little high. We enjoyed sitting outside under the trees. I had a nice cocktail although it was served in a wooden mug which I did not enjoy. It seemed a bit unhygienic. We shared a fish taco which was tasty but then had a burrito which was dry and bland. Maybe we ordered the wrong meals... I don't know. We also only ordered one drink each as the waiter never bothered to come back and we had to walk to the counter when we were finished to pay our bill
3
Only reason why I gave it an average is the service. We were treated nicely by well trained staff. So out of respect for them I can't rate it poor.However the food was poor, greasy and salty, processed, tasteless... ReallyOh and expensive too.Don't bother..
4
El mero mero is located in the Chjimes precinct which once was a convent. It is a delightful Mexican restaurant offering all the usual Mexican fare from fish tacos to meat And seafood quesadillas. They have an excellent beverage menu with great alcoholic concoctions which form a terrific accompaniment to the mouthwatering morsels of Mexican inspired food on offer at this great establishment. On select days there is also live music to enjoy as you wine and dine the night away
4
The dishes all tasted great and so did the sauces. The portions were rather small for the price and the mains didn't have much sides to eat them with.
5
This was such a good experience from start to finish. I booked it for a leaving party. The staff couldn't do enough and the atmosphere was perfect. Great food and drink, highly recommended!
5
Excellent service, a bit of a twist on your typical expected menu for a Mexican restaurant. Worth the visit and the experience.
5
Excellent food. Excellent service. Great wines and beers. One of Singapore's little secret restaurants.
4
Nice place to sit al fresco, when its not too warm. They have an industrial fan which is probably only useful if it happens to be blowing in your direction. We shared the crunchy fish taco, veal and oxtail barbacoa, enmoladas. All were tasty, albeit slightly too salty for my liking. Guacamole was lovely - light an airy w a hint of spice. Was impressed that the staff changed our plates after each course so Iâ€™d say service was good. Would recommend the El Mero Mero Margarita, which was well made. Will be back
4
Decided on this place for dinner despite the many restaurant that is available at Chijmes. Food was expected so not much of comment however could be better compared to other Mexican eateries. We decided to order another round of drinks and food. We waited for the bottle beer to arrive fast as it was a straightforward drink however it didnt arrive fast and the place is not even crowded. Food arrive late too. The best part, upon checking, one of the waiter did not key in our drinks and food order. This was very upsetting. Wait staff did not really pay much attention to diners. Background music did not complement well. We had a hard time getting the staff attention. Hope there is improvement done
5
We wanted to seek out a great Mexican restaurant and found it we think we had! We started with:Guacamole - chunky yet creamy that went superbly with the red and original nachos. It was Taco Tuesday today so we whacked only the taco list! We ordered:Kurobuta Pork "Al Pastor" - caramelised slice of pineapple with strips of pork. I found the pork rather mild in flavour and quite Asian tasting. Ok tacos. Roasted Dorper Lamb - burnt chunks of onions and other wonderful something with slices of grilled lamb. This one is very good!!! Grilled Free-Range Chicken - spicy popcorns are added in this taco but not that you can taste it. The grilled chicken chunks were really good! Not as good as the lamb but very good still. NZ Angus Beef Tenderloin - this! THIS was the star of the night! The seared slices of beef were SO good!! Biting into the burnt fats were just flavour bursting in the mouth! Wow wow wow!!! I could eat this everyday and twice in Sunday!Excellent meal and service is good! Definitely a come-back-for-more place!
4
Visited here with a friend a month or so ago. Very impressed with the service and setting - we chose to sit outside overlooking the courtyard on a warm smothery evening, which meant we made full use of the drinks menu! Mains were delectable, shame about the starters and desert though which fell below par. I am comparing this to Lucha Loco, which delivers on all bases!
1
What a disappointment!We ordered two main courses which turned out to be the size of a starter.Bearing in mind the prices, we felt insulted.My husbands' enchiladas were nice though, just ridiculously small portion.I had the nice lamb dish, where were the vegetables? Just meat a a small potato halved!The manager told us he would pass on out comments to the chef.We went elsewhere to finish our dinner.In three years in Singapore, this was our worst restaurant outing
4
Having submitted a review a couple of years ago saying not fantastic restaurants in Chijmes I have found a very good restaurant and drinks stop - El Mero Mero. For those that love traditional Mexican food you will love this and their speciality El Mero Mero tequila is to die for! Service can be patchy which is why I scored it a 4.
3
Food was great but service needs to improve or it would be a pity. Food presentation and taste was there but a substandard service from waitress can mark down the dining experience.
5
Go there if you are looking for top-notch Mexican food with a modern signature. Strongly recommend trying the cocktails, tacos and guacamole!
4
i stop by this restaurant every year with clients, love the food and the atmosphere, hope it stays for many more years still
5
I have come for a family visit to Singapore. My sister took me out for lunch to Elmero mero today. Amazing food, Excellent location, Courteous staff. Awesome experience.
1
Very poor
Very expensive food, poor quantities. Four mains could not fill up a family of four including a child. Absolutely no variety in vegetarian food either. Poor service as well. Would recommend nor would come here.
4
My wife and I visited for a quiet dinner on Saturday evening. Parking was full due to a wedding reception and we availed of the valet parking service.The reservation was OK (we had a technical glitch, which meant it was not possible to get confirmation on the automated system) and we were seated in the courtyard. The service and food was good. The wild fish Caviche was remarkable. We had a pleasant and relaxed evening. A couple of observations:1. It would be good for the server to advice that the sauce accompanying the Caviche should be mixed with the Caviche. We observed that many of the guests were unaware of this.2. As the first choice dessert was not available my wife opted for the Churos. This was not a good choice. The Churos were tough and hard and the Chocolate sauce did not have the richness we expected.On the whole a good exprienc
5
We ordered almost 6 to 7 dishes and without disappointment liked it all of them. A must try Pork Bun, Chicken tacos, wild fish tacos, Mole and chips, Pepper with gravy, Mexican coke, Churros with chocolate sauce, Enchiladas, Cheesy quesadilla.Slow roasted chicken tacos is a definite winner 
4
We heard that El Mero Mero is the best Mexican in town and were not disappointed. We will certainly be back. All the dishes were very tasty,especially the guacamole and the fajita. Nice atmosphere, and we liked the open kitchen, but the music outside was too loud and more appropriate for a nightclub rather than a chilled Sunday evening. Staff was okay but room for improvement there.
5
This is such a fantastic restaurant, great professional service, an over abundance of chefs who created beautiful Mexican plates of food. Amazing value for money ... Good size glasses of Pinot Grigio for S$9.90 (hotels are S$24.00) could not fault it. Wish we were staying in Singapore longer so that we could visit again. Would highly recommend.
2
Visited last Saturday. We tried to order guacamole to be told that they ran out of avocados. The day before. Apparently, they were just waiting for the grocer to deliver them more avocados to make guacamole. Didn't appear to have occurred to them to just go to shop to buy more. Not difficult but clearly they don't care. Didn't have salsa either. Slow service (had to ask for water/drinks order to be taken) and theb couldn't get us out of the place quickly enough. Shame really as went in Jan and it was great. All in all, other places to spend (quite a lot of) money in Singapore.

Service was ok,The cocktails were nice and the food even better. Overall very satisfied. Perfect for friends, family or business dinner. If weather permits do sit outside and enjoy the nice area. Price is bit high but normal for the location.

El mero mero is awesome. A fun,friendly,funky place with a great food great managers and the best place at chijmes.i just found it incredibly good.i look forward for the next time :)
3
On a recent business trip to Singapore I was with some folks who wanted an "outdoor" eatery and I took them to Chijmes knowing that there were quite a few choices. As a rule, I don't eat Mexican in Asia, and Mero Mero would not make me change that rule.The food was OK Mexican, but I would not go out of my way to visit again. The music was good, under the trees...but the sound system competes with neighboring places and I found that to be distracting. I would still rather find a good Chicken Rice at a neighborhood Hawker stand. But if you must eat Mexican while in Singapore, this place will probably hit the spot
2
The menu sounded great and our daughter really wanted to try the tacos. The menu claims the beef to be grass fed, the chicken free range, etc. so I expected high quality food. The chicken tacos were awful - the meat used was the cheapest cut and hadn't been cooked well at all. The beef was better but still not as tasty as we expected. The guacamole was delicious but at $14 for a small bowl it's probably the most expensive dip I have ever purchased! We went on a Sunday afternoon and by 2.50pm the staff were rushing us to finish as they close at 3.00pm. We won't be visiting agin
4
We had the guacamole, crab cones, roasted dorper lamb, a dish with chicken and a dish with beef. It was all very good! The only thing was I was still hungry at the end. For me the portions were too small. The price is not low.Location is very good. Near to MRT. It is surrounded by a lot of other restaurants and cafes.Waiters were kind in their on way. It felt like they did their best but they didn't know how to do it good. Like when they put a plate in the middle of the table for sharing they rushed away not telling which plate it was
3
Chijmes is a great location and there is lots of competition there. Having been to a few of the restaurants here, I advise that none of them (including Mero Mero) are cheap. It is therefore imperative that these restaurants offer good food and service. Unlike some of the other reviewers here, the service we received was excellent and very friendly - even though it was busy. The food was very good and well presented. My only gripe is that the menu is a little misleading... Their 'Premium Dorper Lamb' although excellent, was actually just two lamb chops, rather than the piece of meat I was expecting. The 'Roasted Suckling Pig' is a small slice from the pig, rather than the small whole animal they serve in many places here. Probably my fault for not asking, but I feel they could be a bit more descriptive. I would definitely go back. However, if you are very hungry, you'd run-up a very large bill eating here
2
It is a shame that the food is so great and the service is so bad. When we arrived they could not find my reservations even though I had the reservation confirmation on my phone. Then we ordered margaritas and a soda and we waited 30 minutes for the margaritas. We had eaten half of our order.I had to ask of water as they never brought any. And once we drank it had to ask for more as no one was really looking after our table. When I complained about not getting the margaritas after 30 minutes, they told me the bar was busy. Oddly, the restaurant was not full to capacity. Once the margaritas came in a small glass full of ice it was gone in 3 sips. It was mostly ice. I would've ordered another one, but was afraid it would take another 30 minutes. I really loved the food but doubt I would return as it is pricey and the service is so poor and does not make for an enjoyable evening when you have to be getting the waitress' attention for water, your drinks, desert,etc. They need someone on the floor supervising the staff

This was my second visit to Singapore and to El mero mero , one of the best place for high quality Mexican food .I just walked in on Monday night , started with Mezcal Chichicapa recommended by the staff , which was so good. They served Pig Bao on the house, they were out standing .Many of the ingredients and sauces are sourced from Mexico ,so there are authentic flavours .well worth a visit. we will be back
3
The restaurant is well situated in the square a great place for a meal or a drink. However the service was terrible and the food was not up to expectation. Our whole table was disappointed in our food selection with a meal going back, and the others extremely small portions. Be very selective with this one
3
So this is my 2nd visit & went with a few friends to have other items on menu so I would be able to give a proper review.Service was ok. A few different drinks were tried and all ok, however the red sangria was not as good as I thought it was going to be. Crab cones, guacamole, fish ceviche, fish tacos, & burrito were all good. Lamb & shrimp taco & slow roasted lamb were not that great. Prices seem a little steep for the portions you get, except for the burrito. I would say its worth a casual visit for a snack & some areas need improvement
4
Very interesting place, nice ambiance, good music, good cocktails and good food made me feel like I was back in Mexico.
4
The restaurant is located in Chijmes, surrounded by great music and outdoor lights. We had nachos with absolutely amazing guacamole to share for starters. Then we had portobello mushroom tacos, and chicken mozzarella fajitas, which we really enjoyed. But beef enchiladas, recommended by the waiter, was just okay. The portions are good for sharing. Didn't like red sangria very much and the establishment can work on improving their service.
1
Do you like slow and clueless service? This place is the epitome of that.It took 20 min and 3 separate requests before someone came to our table with the menus and water.Once the wine is ordered, it took another 10 minutes before they brought wine glasses to us and another 10 minutes before they brought the wine to our table.The classical situation was when we asked the waiting staff what vegetable the dish sitting on our table was, and her reply was it is from China.In general, the service staff was clueless, disinterested and careless.The food was ok if you like Mexican type food.Given the terrible service I had, I will hesitate to go back even if they do pay me for it

El Mero Mero was recommended to me by a Mexican colleague at work. It has turned out to be one of our top 3 dining favorites in Singapore; we are foodies from New York and really appreciate the scrumptious food, excellent service from everyone on the staff and the great atmosphere at Chijmes (they have an amazing outdoor area).Orlando who is the general manager at El Mero Mero is hospitable, professional and a great host! We thoroughly enjoy dining there, and did we say the food is amazing...
5
Yeah. This was a surprise for sure. Given the sheer amount of Mexican restaurants around the world (and lets not forget all the tex-mex fare, Chipotle's, etc.), you kinda have an idea of what the food will be like, even some of the nicer places. But El Mero Mero just blows your expectations out of the water. This is fine dining Mexican food. The decor, ambiance, and service are top notch, and every single dish was delicious. Definitely a must-try if you're in Singapore
4
Part of the newly revamped Chijmes. El Mero Mero is on the upper quarters and next to a lot of other great restaurants. The food is great, specially the kurobuta pork tacos, Spanish pig bao and the ceviche. The portions are tapas style and a bit pricey. Great for an occasional visit. There cocktails are quite nice as well.
4
Chef Remy is simply outstanding! We had Guacamole, Sweet Corn Sampler, Wild Fish Ceviche, Chicken & Portobello Tacos, Braised Pineapple [to-die-for], Tequilla Pecan Pie and their special New Year dessert. Every dish was well put together with amazing flavours from the fresh ingredients and sauces. It shows the high level of thought, art and culinary skills that went into each creation. Staff were friendly and ambience was great for a gathering with great friends. Definitely recommend 
5
On a quest for good Mexican food, we opted to give El Mero Mero a try on a Saturday afternoon. It is not the Mexican food I grew up with in Southern California or Mexico, but a wonderful explosion of tastes using traditional ingredients from South America. From my understanding, many of their ingredients are actually sourced from Mexico. We opted for the Chiefâ€™s Tasting Menu for $88 per person, and were not disappointed. Every dish was creative and a unique presentation. The starter was corn, and a sauce distributed in a toothpaste tub with small donuts. I could not get enough of that delicious sauce. Many of the dishes brought back a lot of fond memories from my traveling in Mexico and Southern California. The inside restaurant is very comfortable, easy for conversation even when full with patrons. You also get to watch the chief and his staff prepare your meal when you sit inside. The serving staff were very attentive, and also did an excellent job presenting and describing each masterfully prepared dish. Trying several of the beverages, the bar does a wonderful job with traditional Mexican beverages, as well as beverages from around the world. I ordered a Mojito for my beverage, which went exceptionally well with many of the spicy dishes. We look forward to going back and trying the taco experience
5
Every dish we ordered, regardless of tapas, mains, tacos or desserts were SO GOOD. Lively service staff and well plated food/tastefully chosen cutlery added another dimension to this experience. Celebrated two birthdays here and they throw in a complimentary dessert and sometimes shots if you are lucky. Enjoyed the food and experience so much and I can't wait to be back. Special mentions include the traditional vodka shots (very good quality vodka great as a starter too!), black pork main dish and its caramelised pineapple dessert. Highly recommend a visit
5
Arriving at this restaurant is spectacular. The restaurant is situated in Chijmes. This is an old school that was converted to a 20 restaurant place. The old buildings are so stunning. The restaurant El Mero Mero is Mexican & the food is amazing. The bluefin tuna tacos were particularly delicious and went very well with the white wine sangria. A worthwhile visit for mexican lover.
5
Go to El Mero Mero and discover a lot of new tastes!
Mexican food is not just Tacos!
Let's enjoy ceviche, beef burrito, suckling pig boa or lamb, you will fall in love!
5
it was a great experience for me to been there, the food & wine was so amazing, I never had such amazing food before. staff was so friendly and helpful. Everything was well organized.
4
Lunch with friends . The serves were quite small but very delicious flavours. The wine list is outrageously expensive . Nice restaurant and great location .
5
I was greatly surprised eating at this place. It was by accident that we went to eat here, although pricey, the food is excellent and service is good. Beef Tenderloin with Bone Marrow is great!!! not to mention the Ceviche or any other taco for the matte
5
Loved this restaurant! The El Mero Mero team are lovely- so warm and welcoming! Food is filled with flavor, savored every bite! Still craving the fish tacos (a must have). The location and setting are perfect way to enjoy Singapore nights. Can't wait to go back..
4
Casual dining experience and the food reminds us of the real thing in Mexico. Staff and very friendly and eager to provide recommendations. The cocktails were the yummiest and excellent value, even the mocktails were delicious. Our family has decided that it is definitely one of our favourite restaurants in Singapore. Beautiful setting
4
The restaurant has a great ambience with a nice outdoor seating. The food and drinks were good. Few vegetarian options but what we had was good. The staff is good for recommendations. In the dessert don't order the churros, they are not so good - we should have listen to the staff but we still went on to try them and were a bit disappointed. But the other ones we tried, the pineapple and the tequila cake, were just great
2
Service was good (lovely young woman from Peru), atmosphere good, food tasty however portion size is stunningly small coupled with a disproportionately high price...Lived in Singapore for eight years now, but sometimes it still happens--price gouging
5
Really friendly and welcoming staff. Followed their directions and had a suckling pig bao dish followed by grilled wild fish taco with a great Chipotle mayo. Ambiance was very cool inside, nice music selection, open kitchen and the food really delicious. Then went on a guided sipping tequila tour, marvelous evening. I will be back:-)
5
As a connessieur of Mission Burittos in San Francisco and fabulous Mexican food experienced in Oaxaca and Merida i wasnt expecting to find such amazing Mexican food here in Singapore. Yes the portions are small :( but just order more! The execution of their dishes cannot be questioned. I just wish i ate my way through the whole menu so i could savour each and every morsel!! We will be back ! Outstanding quality. Yes you pay for it...but shouldnt you expect to? I am happy pay for food made with the utmost thought and execution
5
Wonderful South American cuisine. the ceviche was so delicious we ordered it twice! All the food we ordered was excellent and the cocktails were delicious. The service too was excellent. An excellent place to dine.
3
We went last night for our anniversary dinner, and sat in the courtyard. The ambiance was great, with fun music playing. That area is beautiful. The food was pretty good, especially the wild fish tacos, and the cocktails were excellent. The major major downfall is the portion size verses price. For over $20 you get two teenie tiny little round soft tacos that are eaten in two bites. You should get 2-3 times as much food for what you pay for, it is incredibly ridiculous. On top of that is the 10% service charge and 5% tax. For two people we spent $190 for very little food, and 3.5 cocktails (my one was a mocktail). The cocktails are $24 each, which is standard in Singapore. It is really a special occasion priced meal. Don't get the cheese & mushroom quesadilla, it had a terrible taste to it. Only go if you want to pay a fortune and leave hungry
2
This was pretty disappointing. I definitely advise sitting inside as the atmosphere is impressive and nice. I was wowed walking in by the open exhibition kitchen, bright lights, white counters, well dressed staff. With the rest of the atmosphere around I was excited for dinner. Unfortunately the rest of the experience did not match the atmosphere. It started with the service, when we flagged someone down they were so unsure and soft spoken I thought they were just bus staff not actual waiters, nope they are the actual waiters, and they are all unsure and soft spoken. You have to strain to hear them, and when they deliver food you have no idea what they are saying. I don't know if they are unsure of the pronunciation or if they don't want to interrupt, but it is always a guess as to what they are bringing out.The food was also a disappointment, Tapas sized, Mains priced. The Street Food Corn Sampler sounded so promising, but it is actual baby corn, that vegetable that comes in American Chinese food everyone leaves out. The seasoning on the baby corn was good, but the actual "Corn" was, as always, disappointing. Serve real corn. The Huitlacoche Donuts on the sampler were a pleasant surprise, these would be worth ordering on their own, Fantastic. The rest of the meal was small bites that had some flavor but nothing fantastic and nothing filling.The capping disappointment were the Churros, they were too dense, the dough, and didn't appear cooked enough, additionally the sauce on the side was a very odd taste. We left Churros on the table and had people who "Can't get enough Churros" until they had these :(The drinks were okay, my Margarita with an old dry lime was unique. The mojito in the bamboo glass was popular.Overall, based on the experience, the portions and the service, it was overpriced in my opinion
5
Went with a friend, had tacos. The quality of the food is very good and the chef combines some unusual ingredients. Popcorn on a chicken taco is both original and tasty! Since the dishes are small and you need more than one, they are a little pricey, but well worth it
5
We've recently changed our review style. Please let us know if you have any questions.AMBIENCEAs the location is Chjimes, which you should look up elsewhere, El Mero Mero has both an outdoor and an indoor area. Outside, it's a bit noisy both at lunch and dinner, but it's perfectly fine as you get a bit of "feeling" for the place.NO LOUD MUSIC which is great!SERVICEPerfectly fine by Singapore standards. We give it an 8/10.CHEF'S TABLE or Normal?Hey they Chef's Table is a bit pricey but way cheaper than many others. The best bit, if you're a foodie, is you sit at the bar, and if you're polite, you can speak with the cooks, sous chefs, and Remy. There's a wine pairing which, in our opinion, is good value, but you need to be able to drink. WARNING: It's pretty big and changes a lot (we've done it now two times) so bring your appetite. If you don't want the pairing, then there's a good wine selection, and some interesting beers.TIPSIf you like modern twists on Mexican, you will seriously LOVE this place. If you're expecting traditional, then seek out your stale El Paso taco shells. This guy and his team have some great ways to enjoy a modern, but NOT prickly, nancy, ways of doing Mexican. Having done volunteer work in Mexico I find his food just lovely.Smokers: Yes, I see you! You can smoke outside.Spice/Chilli. If you're not into chilli, fish, or have allergies, they ask you - so no problem there.ACCESS:Easily via City Hall MRT, or if in a taxi, just ask for the Chjimes taxi area. You'll find it pretty easily once inside.PRICES:Well, there's a lot of pricey places in Singapore. And there's a lot of priey places in Singapore that aren't worth it. El Mero Mero is worth it. To the point that we took two friends there and paid for the chef's table. Can you eat there "cheaply"? Hell yes, the taco's, salads, and dips are just great (see attached pictures)OVERALLDoing it again and again. The best "modern" Mexican in Asia

I have wanted to try the food at El Mero Mero for sometime, but unfortunately we were pretty disappointed by the price-quality ratio. I have to say the food was very tasty, but it was the portion size, service and hefty bill that left a lot to be desired. First of all, the pitcher size for margaritas were in no way a good deal. 60sgd++ and we barely got 2 half pours in our tiny glasses (3pax splitting 1 pitcher). Better order by the glass. The lamb tacos had a great flavor, but again, the size was barely two bites each. The pork bao were served nicely, but again were tiny (and the deep fried mantou were quite greasy also). To be fair, the presentation of the tortilla soup was really lovely, in a tea pot with condiments on the side (but you're getting a cup of soup, not a hearty bowl like one expects).All of this, although disappointing, was still enjoyed because it tasted alright. But in the end we were still hungry and decided to cure this by ordering the churros. Wow were we in for a disappointment - it came with 1 mini churro (literally like one 10cm stick) - for 16sgd?!? When I asked why there was only one - there was no show of explanation or managing our expectations but rather a curt "this is how we serve it". This was surely the breaking point. But no..... they then managed to mess up our bill - charging the full amount to one card, then then still taking the cash and charging 1/3 to another card. Again, no explanation, no apology - just "please sign the void slip".Even with small portions and large prices, we still would have left happy had the service been better. We would have easily ordered more, adjusted our expectations and indulged more if the servers encouraged a dialogue and explained their concept of small plates. But instead they were not engaging, and left us dissapointed and wondering why we even bothered.After leaving El Mero Mero we went downstairs to Raven and inquired about their Churros, just to see if our expectations were off. Sure enough, their Churros dish has 5 pieces - for 12sgd...
4
First time we visited we came with a group of friends and loved it. Second time we came as a couple and loved it again! Although he menu is quite pricey, the food is worth it! I tried different things both times, in fact I think they have changed items in between visits, I was not disappointed. So much flavour, variety and just mouth wateringly good. Highly recommen
5
Nothing resembling Taco Bell here. All good food, well prepared and presented. I have no idea whether this is 'authentic' as I have limited experience with Mexican food in Mexico. All of my background is with Mexican food in the US, but authentic or not it was an enjoyable evening. It's a bit pricey, but - yum!Came with DH and two sons (11 and 5) for our weekly dinner-out-as-a-family. This seems to be a place geared toward couples and groups and drinking but they did a fine job dealing with the kiddos. They really enjoyed the tortilla chips with dip - and the chips seemed homemade. Don't remember whether they had a kids menu, but the little one was happy with whatever we got him and I seem to recall it came with a dessert we all drooled over...The 11 year old opted for a $32 roasted pig dish from the regular menu : ( - and demolished it. I think he left me his veg. DH had fish tacos he pronounced excellent, and he's had his fare share so I trust his judgement. I had carnitas or al pastor - I forget. It was yummy either way. I uncharacteristically also had a drink. I think it was a Singapore Sling (I'm sorry - I know that's just too twee, but something came over me). It was good! Garnished with an elegant paper thin dried slice of citrus... Tasty and not so strong I had to be poured into a cab at the end of the meal. The atmosphere and decor were nice and for once the service was attentive and competent, even though it was a Friday night and they were full-ish! The waitress even had some familiarity with the food and was able to advise us on the amount of spice in various dishes. I like CHIJMES so this is definitely a go-to for us. I really hope they don't close! I have noticed the menu seems to change. But honestly, I think they'd do a stand-up job with whatever was on offer. Go try something and see what you think
5
I see that there are quite a few mediocre reviews of this restaurant on this site but that most of them are by "one time only" reviewers. In my experience, that is not a good sign - vs someone like me that does a LOT of restaurant reviews. I'm difficult to please, easily irritated, occasionally grumpy - and i do a lot of traveling and eating - so when i tell you that the tacos at El Mero Mero are possibly the best in town, please believe me. The ceviche was excellent and the fish tacos were so good we had four orders. The pecan pie and churros were also excellent. Even the Margaritas were good - and unlike a lot of local places that serve watered down and/or weak Margaritas. My only complaint is that the drink service was a tad slow - but we managed..
4
It was a lovely Sunday evening and we happened to pass by this resto placed in a beautiful charming setting by an old church. We were greeted very nicely by the manager, and sat ourselves at a table perched on a raised platform, overlooking the outdoors. We went for the El Mero Mero Ceviche, Atlantic Grilled Octopus and Enchiladas Verdes. We didnt have to wait long for all of them. We were served the Ceviche first, and it took our breath away. The Enchiladas had a great sauce, but I felt the prawns could have been cooked better. The octopus looked really good and its first bite impressed us, but subsequent bites felt boring because the meat could have been softer. If not for these flaws, this place and its food would have been heavenly perfect
3
First time here, we had a warm welcome by a Mexican woman, who gave us some recommendations from the menu.
Food and cocktail were okay, but too overpriced compared to the portions in my opinion.
4
Some unusual pseudo-Mexican dishes - pretty delicious! The dark chocolate ganache dessert was really good. Location (CHIJMES) also convenient and ambience nice for a lunch.
1
I've never written a restaurant review, but I had to share this here on TA. First off, this is a restaurant with great decor in a beautiful setting within Chijmes. Major points for that. Service was good too, no issues here and found the staff to be pleasant. Overall the food was tasty too. Not the best tasting ever but on food taste merits, would be worth another visit. What bothered me most was the fact that they put grasshoppers in my order of Guacamole. I respect that grasshopper is found in Mexican food as a delicacy but if you are going to put bugs in the guacamole, please disclose that on the menu before I drop $18 on it. The menu clearly says: Guacamole - Pico de Gallo, Tortilla Chips $18. Why would i expect to have grasshoppers in my Guac if it was advertised as "Guacamole, Pico de Gallo and chips"? When we questioned the wait staff, their answer was "because it's Mexican food".I'm from California where we eat our fair share of Cali-Mex and I've never had or heard of grasshoppers in Guacamole. I understand it's a real thing, and that's totally cool, but friggin' disclose that REALLY important ingredient on the menu!I also got the Chicken Mole dish ($34). It was comprised of a chicken breast dropped into Mole sauce. They didnt even bother to put sauce over the chicken, let alone slow cook it, mix it or marinate it. Literally just chicken dropped into sauce accompanied by Chinese/Thai style rice...We also got the corn on the cob. I was expecting some Nacho Libre style corn with the white sauce and spice. We got baby corn on the cob instead. I must admit that the donuts that came with the corn were the bomb. those were extremely yummyWhile the atmosphere was cool, we felt the food preparation was very underwhelming and expensive
2
My husband and I recently visited El Mero Mero and had really high hopes.Unfortunately the evening saw one let down after another, slow service, incorrect orders, my husband had finished his main before I was served mine which was wrong, average food, duty manager rude and to top it off we were short changed.All in all a real let down and pretty expensive for what it is even by Singapore standards.Far better burrito found at Mex Out for a fraction of the price
5
An amazing lunch morphed into an afternoon of snacks and drinks and extended itself through dinner! Yes, it was that good!!! From starters through mains, deserts and drinks, the flavors and textures were fun, exciting, and at times surprising. The grilled octopus was a serious keeper (we had it three times in the extended at the table that lasted for almost 8 hours)! Add in the fantastic cocktails, awesome service, and ambiance, and we were left with a fantastic memory that will stay with us for a long time. Highly recommend!!
5
OMG! What a beautiful place to graze with friends the flavors are exciting and well executed. The fare is fresh and prepared with artistic flair and passion. A marriage of cultures that takes risks that pay off. Service is Friendly fun but professional. An excellent selection of cocktails to complement the flavors and an extensive international wine list. magnifico! No Mames
2
Went there for lunch and have to say it was more than disappointing. To start we ordered chips and salsa and guacamole to start not realizing that would be two separate starters we were charged $30 for what basically was very bland salsa half a bag of chips and guacamole that was probably made in the morning. Nothing special about the huac at all, could taste avocado and that was about it.The tacos are priced form $26-$36 for three very small tacos. As a test I decided to make my own steak tacos a couple of days after and made about 20 tacos for $15 and they tasted way better.Do yourself a favor and give this place a miss. If you want good mexican food in Singapore go to Lica Loco. Its way overpriced as well but it tastes way better and the ambience is more fun
5
My first visit to El Mero Mero was July 2014 was drawn to the lovely ambience. Being a tequila fan, I am super impressed that they a long list of tequilas. Big love. Didn't try their food until recently.I must say their food is great, especially Guacamole! I had plenty and will definitely go back for more! The price is worth the deliciously made gourmet!Service is excellent! They are attentive to their guests and making sure their food and drinks are served/top up promptly! Great smiles from every staff!Highly recommended Mexican Restaurant
5
I have to say that I visited this restaurant about 6 months ago and I thought it was mediocre in all senses. Last thursday night, me and my wife decided to give it a second try since we were craving Mexican food. I stand corrected! The food, ambiance and service changed drastically. We had guacamole and chipsas starter together with the "cool looking" corn sample. We were shocked. The quality of the ingredients is superb! We followed recommendations from the staff since she was mexican. I must say that the fish tacos and the baby goat tacos are out of this world. I been in Mexico a couple of times and this restaurant is as good as it gets outside of Mexico. Definitely coming back! Yes, the prices are on the high side but thats what you pay when you bring your avocados straight from Mexico. Oh, and don't forget to ask the manager for a mezcal and worm salt recommendation
5
I have to say this is the best and really really authentic Mexican restaurant in Asia! Great quality of the food, also very good portions, love the drinks, my favorite is called Lover Boy, then there is one more called Mero Mero which is Mezcal with an orange smoky flavor, truly refreshing and original! As for the food, there are so many mouth watering dishes!! Veal tongue taco is delicious, if you want something light, the Mero Mero salad is yummy!! The suckling pig is just perfection! Don't miss the seafood Bloody Mary cocktail!! This is a must try; You will want to come back for more every time! And the grilled octopus cooked perfectly! The enchiladas verdes are swimming in a yummy green salsa and when you finish you just want to drink it up.....and I can go on and on.... That's my place to go when I just want to pamper myself with real great Mexican food
3
If you eat here, be prepared to spend 50 SGD for a (supposedly angus beef) burrito and a coke. Was the burrito amazing? Uhm...not really. But the ambiance is good and the drinks are fine.
5
I know and love Mexican food. I keep looking around the world for Modern yet authentic Mexican food - its hard to find. Very hard.
This place is it. The real thing. Mole (great!), Carnitas tacos, amazing Ceviche.
Simply amazing.
(A bit pricy, though...)
5
The place to go if you're craving for Mexican food. Love the food here, great ambience and impressive service! I always have a really good experience when I come dining here.
4
Happened upon this Mexican gem on the first night of our trip. As a coeliac I was relieved to see a menu marked with "g"s to indicate gluten free food - and it was delicious! Beautiful setting in the Chjimes! Would definitely recommend :)
4
We went for dinner midweek. Good service, nice selection of small dishes, I recommend the grilled octopus and taco with wild fish. My husband had black angus burrito which was a much larger dish. Be aware this is not tex-mex so melted cheese is not there and the food is quite light. There are plenty of nice places to dine at in that area, which is an old convent turned into foodie heaven. Worth visiting with or without food
5
Went there for a lunch last thursday and have to say the food was great. The crab cones were filled with sweet crab meat and topped off with a generous portion of ikura. The filete y tuetano was filled with perfectly grilled angus tenderloin and bone marrow wrapped in a corn tortilla. The tostada de atun was also filled with crunchy fresh tuna, absolutely delicious. The ceviche wasn't much to shout at, but the rest of the food more than made up for it. Would have loved to have tried the grilled octopus but the suppliers didn't deliver it in time for lunch. Would definitely go back again soon to try the rest of the dishes
5
Everything we had was amazing. The pork carnitas tacos I had were juicy and well flavoured. Service was warm and friendly and attentive even though we were seated in a corner. With just the right balance of smokiness and taste of chocolate, the chicken mole is one of the best I've tasted in Singapore. The winner of the night (although this may be a strange thing to say) was the grilled pineapple dessert. I loved grilled pineapple and El Mero Mero's version really blew it out of the water for me. For drinks, I had a pisco hibiscus sour and it was very well balanced and tasty. Prices are a little higher than the usual mexican places but for the quality of food and drink and the service we received, I'll definitely be back

Was on Singapore on a short visit. Have lived in Dubai for a year and Being Mexican was missing good authentic Mexican food. A friend recommend us the place, And i cant say anything else than SUPERB. The place is really nice behind the church have a comfy terrace and the service was really good. But the food was spectacular, would be an excellent choice in any place of Mexico. Start with the huitlacoche donuts, different and really good. Then jump to the carnitas and the lengua tacos, some of the best I have tried in my life and finish the concert with the churros with chocolate uffffff, spectacular. The mixed drinks were ok. But can be better.A must stop.

A really nice atmosphere and you need to book for dinner at the weekend.A lot of choice on the menu but very limited for vegetarians and vegans. My hubby thought his portion was rather small for the price and I stuck to guacamole and salsa. Both were delicious though I was puzzled about the cheese in the salsa. Home made tortilla chips were yummy.A very enjoyable evening and service was efficient and attentive. A lot of drinks choices too.I would go back but not often and especially if I'm having a guacamole craving but it doesn't cater well to non meat and dairy eaters

We totally enjoyed the tacos but only find it a little pricey, $13 per piece. Catch happy hour from 5pm-7pm at $9.90 per alcoholic drink. The red sangria is overly sweet and the lack of alcohol. The white sangria definitely flair better. Each of us had about 2 happy hour drinks plus food, Spent about $75 per pax @ 4pax. Would i return again? Yes, for a celebration occasion but not for regular casual dining.

Great selection of tacos. Very tasty. Staff were frazzled and service strained, but it all arrived n the end and was worth the wait.

Overpriced for what it is. Small portions/cocktails at high prices and average quality. Shame as its a nice setting sat outside overlooking the church.

Diluted Mexican food at ridiculous prices. Ever been to Mexico???
Tacos $13 per piece!
Chicken Mole that tasted like chicken that's been boiled in Chocolate milk!
What a joke!

We have been coming back here a number of times now and find it one of the better Mexican restaurants in the city. The presentation and quality of the food, the ambiance (it's really a lovely restaurant with both outdoor seating as well as indoor, facing an open kitchen) and service... all of it make it a more than very good experience

The food was simple, and very tasty. Last time we were in Singapore and the restaurant had not long opened we were tempted to eat there but thought prices expensive. I think the prices have gone down so we gave it a go and were not disappointed. We sat outside on a warm night and thoroughly enjoyed it. Would recommend but don't sit near the border of the next door restaurant. We did but moved as both restaurants had competing music. An idea......have same music

El mero mero has a good cocktail list but the bar also makes other cocktails upon request . The food is amazing but only dine here if you appreciate good food because the smaller portions might be a cause of complain . The food is very beautifully detailed and delicious . Every dish we ordered was like a work of art . The staff were very attentive towards us even though they could do with more staff on the floor. We were seated at the outdoor section and I noticed that the chef , who I'm assuming is the head chef, kept coming outside to check how everything was doing outside and interacted with some of their customers . And sometimes he even personally serves the food which I think makes the customer feel special . The manager was very polite and she kept making sure that we had a great time there. Not going to lie, we were about difficult being a large group and all and she was patient and always smiling. Please ask the staff for recommendations on the food because they never failed to give us great recommendations . The pecan pie , not in the menu , is a MUST TRY. 10/10 would go back again but not before I try the other restaurant in chijmes

We organized a company party. We were forced by management to choose over fixed menu. The quality of dishes were disappointing for all the team (9) and price quite high. It seems groups are not interesting. To avod if you want to make happy your staff/guests

Really not sure what to make of my visit to this place. A liitle odd/surreal may just about sum it up. We choose this place after contemplating a few of the other restaurants in the stunningly beautiful Chijmes complex. For some reason we decided to eat inside which disappointed me a bit until I saw the open kitchen as I always like to see the Chefs at work. The open kitchen though is where it all started to get a bit surreal. To say there was an atmosphere amongst the kitchen staff would be severely understating it .As it is an open kitchen the confrontation, histrionics and swearing which would go on in a normal kitchen just couldn't happen in front of customers so it all went on with whispers,looks, facial expressions and hand gestures . A bit like a mimed version of gang street fight. It culminated in what appeared to be the head chef throwing a strop, downing tools and walking out in the middle of service. As I said a little surreal to watch but utterly hilarious. Due to the position of her seat most of it was missed by my wife who kept asking why I was laughing so much !Anyway the comedy aside we both enjoyed the food. As has been mentioned what was on offer certainly wasn't the usual kind of tex mex cuisine but I was say it was their take on mexican rather than " authentic " mexican ( though I am not sure exactly what this means in a food culture as hugely diverse as Mexico's ) and I would have liked a few more citrus based options ( as opposed to chilli based ) . That said the food we ordered we enjoyed and that is the bottom line. My wife had no complaints about her cocktails and I enjoyed my modelo. Price-wise it was leaning towards "expense account" and portions were small but not meagre. On reflection I would try a different option at Chijmes before returning here. Good but not very good

We just found the ideal place with authentic Mexican dishes in the perfect portion for ladies! The margaritas are yummy, wild fish is indeed mind blowing and the veal tongue/oxtail is to die for! Freshly made guacamole ... although the chips are bit on the oily side. Tres leches still needs some work ... but we will surely be back to taste the improvement! p.s. nice location - the Chijmes also offers many other dining options even if you fancy something other than Mexican

When you live in Germany, it is sad that you must travel to SNG for Mexico food. This restaurant is Mexican, not tex mex. and it does not matter. The food was quite good. I had the chicken with green sauce, which was delicious. Just a quick note though, their capirihna was terrible and not worth finishing. Luckily, Corona is the same everywhere. I liked the restaurant and will go back.
5
Great tasting nacho's, with amazing varieties using wild unthinkable mixed ingredients. Ambiance was great, casual Mexican dining to the letter. Loved it, would go back, though deserts were overpriced for their portion sizes.

It's hard to find fault with food in Singapore. This place served really nice Mexican snacks and tacos, as well as great cocktails. It's in a more relaxed part of town (Chijmes), the venue overlooks a nice patch of grass.

This was the strangest take on Mexican food we have ever experienced. Not a great selection if you're vegetarian like me, but enough to get by. We enjoyed the nachos and guacamole as a starter...I had some kind of

Living in Singapore for three years and while I've walked by this place many times, I finally stopped in last night and what great food. Was with a friend from Texas and we both marveled at what was as close to authentic Mexican and NOT Tex-Mex. From the Salsa, chicken tacos and a very good pork carnitas, it was all quite tasty although the the chip/ salsa servings needed some size increase. They were out of Modelo Negro the 8 Reales beer was a nice find. Worth the trip and a revisit from me. Oh, and the outside seating and beautiful Chijmes is always a nice touch

This was lots of fun. Dropped into the open courtyard setting under a perfect Singapore evening. Food on share plates was excellent. And once we demonstrated our interest and enthusiasm for the share plates they were super attentive. Loved the crab cones and cerviche. Great use of spices too. Highly recommended for something different.

I haven't been to Mexico sino don't know what's authentic and what's not when it comes to Mexican food. I tried to corn sampler and it was an interesting dish concept. Flavorful and made interesting especially with this unique sauce drawn from a toothpaste-like tube. I also didn't know Mexico has a wide array of wines. I tried the La Cetto Sauvignon Blanc 2012 and ur wasn't bad at all. I'll come back for other dishes and maybe I can rate it better next time. For now I can say it's an average restaurant with interesting concepts but can be improved with more lively service.

I have lived in Mexico and Singapore. This restaurant served the worst food I have experienced in any restaurant in either of these countries. The Ceviche is far too small for the price, not that you would want more given the lack of flavour. The tacos are better, but at these prices a restaurant should make sure that all dishes are good. The good news is that there are many good restaurants in the surrounding area, and it was the first time I ended up going to a second restaurant for lunch

A friend an I recently went to this "authentic" Mexican bistro nestled in the heard of the Chijmes Entertainment Complex. The decor is modern, but with traces of the old colonial convent that Chijmes used to be. The open kitchen concept is excellent, as you get a feel as if you're out on the street in Mexico, with vendors cooking your food right in front of you. My friend and I ordered 2 appetizers (the street corn and nacho chips). The street corn was not authentic (being made with baby corn), but the cornmeal donuts were amazing. They had just the right amount of sweet, coupled with the signature sauce (served in a toothpaste-tube), to be delicious. The main dishes were good, but not great. I had the veal tongue tacos and my friend had a chicken burrito. While not horrible, we expected more from a restaurant that touted "authentic Mexican." We ordered desserts, and waited...and waited and waited. It took more than 30 minutes for our desserts to come out. While the desserts were highly decadent and perfectly made, it just took way too long for them to be brought to our table. I had the banana cream puffs (a special for the menu that is not a regular offering) and my friend had the tres leches cake. Both were exquisite, but I think we were too upset by how long they took to get to the table to fully enjoy them. In all, our experience at El Mero Mero was average. Would we go back again? Possibly, but we'll plane a long stay

My dinner yesterday was my most enjoyable in a mexican restaurant el mero mero, the food was very tasty, the staff and the assistant manager (jeet) were very friendly, they serve me well with the smile,im very satisfied with their service..thank you el mero mero (

Don't normally expect high quality Mexican in Asia ... this place was quite a surprise.Guacamole & chips came out in a generous portion and was spot on for taste.Had two individual tacos, both of which came out with a sauce recommended to compliment them. Tasty and a good meal value for the quality and quantity of food.Beer selections were fairly routine with the exception of a few Mexican beers ... including one of my favorites, Negro Modelo

Everything we tried were really impressive, very orthdox Mexican food. Must-try:Guacamole, tuna, octopus, donuts, tacos, and all the dessert. Cocktails are also very nice. Suitable for all dining purposes: indoor is more upscale while outdoor seating is more relax and causual. Highly recommend.

Went for dinner with some friends and we were pretty disappointed, especially for the price!The menu is pretty uninspiring, the octopus starter was chewy, and the main dish portions were tiny, not to mention cold by the time I ate mine! Dessert portions were equally small and not great value.We drank sangria, which was far too sweet, and distinctly lacking alcohol!Service was slow and fairly rude at times.Not a place I would visit again, there are definitely better Mexican restaurants in singapore

Situated in the historical center of chijmes the restaurant others a large terrace as well as a nice closed dining area with a bar in between both. It is modern yet very cosy calm but with a nice background music. And if you visit the restaurants website the dishes served are what you see. We where 5 and all impressed by the quality and the flavours of the food we ate a real chef is in the kitchen and it transcripts directly into the plates. You are served colours and smells and your mouth discovers flavours and suprises.Not the mexican food you would expect and are used to!Cant wait to taste the chefs table once it starts because would really love to discover his cooking on an exclusive basis.We said we all would return

Very good Mojitos and guacamole outside with a great view and atmosphere - we loved our apperitif. But then when it came to the main dinner portions were so small - starter size for the price of a regular main!!! Nice service. At the end not super value

Came here with the kids hoping to have some good Mexican food. Unfortunately the chef of this place is uncompromising…so uncompromising he refused to put some chicken in the kids burritos (my children have issues with vegetables and can't eat them and there was nothing else on the kids menu they would eat.) We're not going to pay 60 bucks for burritos for our children, sorry. In a modern world, customer service makes a difference. Cannot recommend this place for families, the attitude of the chef must change

I went with a friend to have delicious Mexican food, actually the taste of the food is so good but I had such a bad experience ordering the "Ceviche". It is too small for the price, very dissapointing! :-( I am from South America and you will always expect a good ceviche portion this is so small for the price!! I definitely won't go back and I won't recommend this place ! There are better Mexican places in singapore with reasonable prices and better size portions

It was my birthday and I was looking for a place to chill. I decided to start the party early by having a few drinks (in the afternoon). Being in the CHIJMES area, I came to this restaurant which has a nice alfresco bar just outside the main dining area (which is air-conditioned). I sat down to order several drinks from their bar menu: El Mero Mero Cocktail, Pisco Sour Hibiscus Cocktail, Cancun Whisper Cocktail and Latin Lover Cocktail.I especially like the El Mero Mero which is potent. The Cancun Whisper and Pisco Sour were also good. High marks should be given to Latin Lover for the unique presentation style and the pretty flower petals and Passionfuit seeds.With all the drinks I had, I had an alcohol buzz. I left the place happy, and headed straight to my dinner venue for the birthday dinner.Do visit them and try their cocktails

Went to this restaurant with much expectations. Most of the traditional Mexican fare is done with a twist. The regular salsa with nachos were not there. They have their own twist. The waiters changed during the course of the dinner with some confusion. One order was forgotten and apologised as "not keyed in". The food was good and tasty. Small portions though
4
Lovely venue, well decorated. The negatives were blown away by the positive of finally finding good Mexican in Singapore (yes, we have been to Lucha Loco and Super Loco). Negatives were the price (expensive, but hey, this is Mexican in Singapore...) the starter (we didn't enjoy the crab cones) and the craft beers (stick to the margaritas). The positives were an outstanding carnitas and fish tacos, super yummy desserts and a great port to wash it down. Service was attentive and prompt (although it was quiet on a Sunday evening

One of the best restaurants that offer mexican food in the world with a great atmosphere. Prices are very reasonable for Singapore. Food is tasty, and portions are big. I recommend the grilled octopus and the nachos, they are the best plates I have ever eaten, also the dessert is well prepared specially the fruit sorbet and the chocolate tart, delightful!

I can't belive than a tacos can be have that quality! I'm italian and i love great food. That place surprise me.

Our party of four dined here recently.As there were four of us, we decided on sharing a wholesuckling pig.Whilst waiting, we were served potatoes with cheese dressingand the other, with a spicy dressing.The suckling pig was served on a iron platter and cut up in quarters.There were some onions grilled with it.The lecon was very tender but to me the meat was rather bland,though there was a bottle of spicy sauce if you want to lift up thedish.I expected the marinade (herbs & sherry ?) to come through, hence I said the meatwas rather bland. I expected the skin to be crackling but alas not so.This dish also comes with warm tortias (?) as a wrap. I fancy itis insufficient for the amount of roasted pork.As there were no other sides of vegetables, we ordered a salad to gowith this.I must say that the whole suckling pig is more than sufficient for four,unlessthe party are hearty diners !We had red wine to accompany the meal too

I'm a big fan of Lucha Loco and have eaten there many times. My favorite item there is the Baja Fish Taco and in my review of that restaurant I declared them the best fish tacos in Singapore. And I do love the Baja Fish taco at Lucha Loco. But I must say that the other beef and pork tacos at Lucha Loco I think are just ok. This is where El Mero Mero really amazed me, they have: fish taco, beef taco, and beef tongue taco and all of them were excellent! Are the tacos expensive? Yes, welcome to Singapore. I think it is outrageous what nice restaurants charge but they all do it. If you want cheap eats go to the hawker centre. We also had the baby corn appetizer which was likewise delicious. Also the margaritas were great. Alas I too experienced poor service, they were slow, forgot things. It took me forever to order my second drink, though I asked for it twice. Finally when the manager stopped by and I told her I'd been waiting a long time for my drink she went over and got it sorted out and I received it shortly thereafter. I also was charged an additional $4 for extra salsa. Seems a bit greedy but there you have it. They charge for the bread at La Forketta but I still go there too because I love the food. But really, really guys the service must improve. Unlike another reviewer I don't think this justifies a "poor" rating because I think the food is most important. But if it hadn't been for the service I definitely would've ranked these guys as Excellent. I'll be back

First time in the restaurant and it is definitely my last. I have never bothered to write a bad review on any restaurant but felt compelled to write about this place. My boyfriend had raved about the burrito and insisted on bringing me here. Big mistake. The food was decent. We enjoyed the suckling pig and burrito, though they were VERY stingy on the salsa (was given a spoonful of salsa for the $32 carnitas ordered and was then charged an extra $4 for an extra spoon of salsa. Also wasn't told about the charge when it was brought to us). For a Mexican restaurant that's charging a bit more than a casual fare, this is definitely not acceptable. Personally, I feel a Mexican restaurant shouldn't hold out on the salsa etc when having tacos. Service was HORRID. Each time we asked for something from the waitress, another waitress will have to clarify what we had asked for. The service staff there clearly didn't seem to know their menu well. What really killed the experience? There were flies in the restaurant (fruit flies - seem like a CHIJMES issue) and the waitress actually pulled out a bottle of insect repellant and tried to discreetly spray under all the tables!!! She then proceeded to spray on a table with utensils on it!!! Instead of cleaning up the whole table and replacing all the sets of utensils, she only changed one set!! We were mid way through our meal, breathing insect repellant in a restaurant with open kitchen concept. That's worst than disgusting!Though I am inclined to never step foot in this place again, i do believe in the objective of restaurant reviews and hope the above mentioned issues are resolved quickly.

Last week, while I was on leave, I was thinking of a place for lunch. Only 1 restaurant came to mind, and I brought my lunch partner here to try their lunch set menu.I have been here before and I recommended going for a set lunch and their grilled octopus leg. Here’s the verdict:- Vuelve a la Vida: This was like a cerviche, but with added tomato juice added in. It had fresh prawns, fish, Clam and avocado in a Tomato Cocktail. It was served in a cocktail glass in a small bucket of ice and topped with a crispy flat taco with pieces of sliced avocado. The tomato cocktail was tangy and complimented the seafood in it. It was a refreshing appetiser.- Burrito de Pollo: Burrito with Charcoal grilled chicken, Chihuahua Cheese, Rice, Beans, Avocado and Lettuce. The chicken was nice and tender. I could taste that it was charcoal grilled, with its slight smokiness. Definitely a tummy filler, if you are eat this dish all by yourself. - Pina con Piloncillo: A dessert consisting of Caramelised Roasted Pineapple, Chantilly ice cream and topped with freshly grated Lime Zest. The roasted pineapple was cut and placed on a plate and topped with the caramelised sauce from roasting the pineapple. The Chantilly Vanilla ice cream was home-made and eating it with the grated lime zest was nice and refreshing. Try it!- Grilled Octopus Leg: This was the highlight of our meal. Ever since I had this a few weeks ago, I cannot get it out of my mind. You get a charcoal oven-grilled octopus leg atop corn cream on a plate garnished with black garlic paste and Tajin Ash. The octopus is succulent and gives a good bite. The corn cream has chilli flakes in it that makes it a tad spicy. It complements the octopus. Must-try!The lunch sets are good value and it is a good opportunity to try what the restaurant has to offer on the extensive ala carte menu.Recommended

My hubby and I went to El Mero Mero last night to have a few drinks and a bite to eat. When a waitress brought our drinks, she knocked one of them and spilled it all over my dress, my favourite handbag and a book I had at a table. Afterwards she looked rather confused what to do, so said ‘sorry’ two or three times, and went away showing little concern about all that mess. I went to a bathroom and spent the next couple of minutes cleaning my belongings. When I came back, we decided not to let this experience to spoil our evening as accidents like this can happen. However, the difference between a good and a poor customer service is what happens next. In places where the staff is good and caring, they try to make up for the bad experience. They will do their best to make you happy again. It can be something as little as offering you a drink or snack on the house, but it shows you that they care and value their customers. If they do something like that, often it turns you from an unhappy customer to a happy and loyal one.In the case of El Mero Mero, we were terribly disappointed as the staff tried nothing to make up for the bad experience we had. Such a pity and a lost chance to turn first timers into regulars..

we had been to the Raffles for a drink and quickly escaped because of the high drink prices. wandered across the road to the Chimneys- the Old Convent- the grounds now converted into several restaurants, very diverse choices. EL MER MERO was written up as "Mexican" and we nearly didn't go in- BUT so glad we did. Had the SUCKLING PIG (S$135 for 4 ) seemed a lot, but what a feast- its sooo much food you don't need much else (had guacamole+some veggies+rice). It actually turned out NOT an expensive meal and the staff were fantastic. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED - and we are fussy

First of all, the fish tacos.. amazing.. a little pricey but seriously worth it. Don't share..I spend my birthday with my parents and El Mero Mero and I gotta say first of all, the service was really really good. When i asked for recommendations the manager Jose was just super friendly and honest about what was good and so were the 2 female servers. Basically, I can see why some people or locals would say they food may not have hit their mark, but for what true mexican food is with the huitlacoche and the mole and the Guero chillies man, this stuff was pretty legit. Overall, We ordered a lot of food and they all had something unique about them. Especially the pork cheeks and the tuna tostadas and freaking fish taco!! I'd definitely go back! Oh wines by the glass list is pretty awesome too

Our visit to El Mero Mero was one of the worst experience I have had in a while. To conmand a tripadvisor review is always a very good or bad experience. Myself and 2 girlfriends made a reservation for 2 but turned up for 3. Manager's attitude was suggesting that it was our fault and did little to provide a great welcoming experience. We were hurried to ordering without much of a recommendation (when asked) as staff said she is new. We ordered a couple of dishes and the raw scallop with seasoning was badly prepared, plus the fried grasshoppers was cold and salty. Rest of the dishes was average, non impressive. Throughout the eating experience, we were often hurried into ordering as we were enjoying our chats. When we finally asked for the bill and provided feedback on the scallops, the same manager replied that it's because the scallops are raw, that's why they taste weird. We were just taken by surprise how unconcern the reply is and how bad service recovery is from the manager. We had many raw food experience and never received such an excuse from the management. We met another friend who happened to be in the same restaurant, walking out before us, and he said he and his friends left the restaurant as the food was pretty bad. Hope the next visitors have a better experience.

Booked El Mero Mero for dinner through the Amex 30licious promo fr now till 2 Nov. For a $30++, I got a starter, a main course and dessert. Service was good, wait staff were attentive.For starters, we had the pork belly caesar salad, the salad dressing had a zing of spice...very refreshing and different, the pork belly nicely roasted, not too fatty...the heartiness of the pork belly sure warrants a return.For main course, we had choice of Al Pastor (grilled kurobuta pork w/pineapple over a tortilla) and the Pork Carnitas (marinated pulled pork). The Pork Carnitas is a MUST ORDER! The pork was well marinated, though it looked dry...the taste was nice mix of salt and roasted goodness when it went into the mouth, dish was accompanied by salsa and hot pepper sauce. when you roll everything into a soft tortilla...i would describe it was a wonderful burst of flavors and you would want more. My girl fren recently back from Mexico, said, the dish tasted like how it is meant to be! This compliment speaks for itself. Had passion fruit sorbet for dessert. it was absolutely refreshing and wonderful finish for dinner.El Mero Mero...i am so visiting again very soon
