Staying at the Mandarin Oriental the pool is served by the Dolce Vita. The toasted sandwiches were tasteless. The food in the restaurant looked great
4
Hidden on the fifth floor of marina mandarin, the setting is really nice, sit outdoor to enjoy the pool view. Food is authentic, however the service staff committed a faux pas and was told off by my Italian friend that he shouldn’t offer Parmesan on top of the seafood pasta we ordered. Other than this lil’ hiccup, enjoyed the dinner
3
We had lunch at the pool side. Food was fine but we felt it was expensive for what it was. Wine in Singapore is not cheap and you accept that as part of the trip. However, a glass of white wine at Dolce Vita is really the worst value we experienced in Singapore. $26 is what we expect in the Mandarin that's fine, but the glasses of wine poured at barely more than a sipping test. Our advice would be just order the bottle. Every where else in the Mandarin was fine and around the pool fine, but Dolce Vita was very poor. 2 glasses of white wine, salad and a Pizza $150 I accept, but at least pour me a glass of wine
5
Overall ambience was excellent. We were given a huge indoor table for the four of us, with extra chairs for our belongings. We had a great view of the outdoor pool. We ordered a couple of starters while waiting for the last person to arrive, but they were a bit slow so that by the time they arrived, our last member had just reached too (perfect timing?). The main courses were mostly excellent (beef cheek, risotto) but it was the desserts which really stood out
5
We have been returning here every year we pass through Singapore and never disappointed. Wonderful selection of Italian dishes and both the presentation and Service outstanding. During the month of February they have a Mediterranean Sea Treasure selection including Lobster..superb I may also add they have a great selection of Wines to choose from.Excellent for both Lunch and Dinner overlooking the Pool, and the harbour and some tables outside but as it’s fairly hot around 31C I would suggest an inside table with Airconditioning
5
The location by the pool at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel is great - sort of elegant casual. However the service is definitely premium and the food and the wine selection superb. I'd recommend the set menu but then we also saw a number of items on the a la carte menu that we would have liked to try. They have a great wine list and if you are not sure the sommelier or wait-staff are very knowledgeable
5
Best food, fantastic service, can praise it enough. The staff were brilliant, attentive but not excessive. As it was a treat we upgraded the brunch menu to champagne and it truly was free flowing. The food quality was excellent and really good value.
5
The restaurant is located near pool and have a great marina view as well. The food was fantastic and service was just ok.
5
During our recent stay at the Mandarin Oriental, we had dinner at Dolce Vita and found the experience outstanding. Lovely location overlooking Marina Bay and excellent service. Good menu and high quality food. We would particularly recommend a memorable dessert - pannacotta with smoky vanilla ice cream. Presentation was exquisite and the unusual ice cream was very successful
5
It is a wonderful experience for me and my business associates from overseas. They enjoyed the food and drink
5
I have had dinner twice at this restaurant. Environment was quite nice and romantic. Food was quite good and delicious.
3
It is a nice place in the upper inner yard of the hotel with beautiful bar overlooking Marina. We decided to have dinner here and we were dissapointed in geneneral. Staff was friendly and excelently trained, but food...We ordered duck breast and fish baramundi. Fish was avesome , but duck breast seemed just to beated in microwawe and to say it was not tender enough would be a mistake...It is Italian restaurant and maybe cheff knows how to make pizza/pasta, but not other meals
5
Excellent top-notch service. Fantastic food. Mesmerizing view of the marina bay night scenery. It was a perfect dinner.
5
Mandarin Oriental Singapore is one to the best hotels that I like. And I always stay in.great service and the club lounge is excellent.Resturants are OK but I prefer other resturants in Singapore
4
Likely the best fine dining Italian restaurant in the city. Ask for a table by the window so you can get spectacular views. I particularly enjoyed the truffle risotto and the wild mushroom soup. Lovely service
5
This is one of my favourite Saturday free flow brunch places. They bring you the food (so you don't need to get up from the table) and the food is incredible. Great Italian dishes. There's also a cheese, bread, and dessert table that you can help yourself too
5
The food is excellent, from the Starter to the Main and the Dessert, everything was delicious. The service staff are very attentive and extremely polite. We enjoyed our Dinner very much.
5
The service here is always TOP notch!Food wise, it’s just hands down one of the best Italian Restaurants in Singapore! Very good choices of wines as well.The restaurant has been renovated recently so it has more pop of colours and brighter too so it’s perfect for pics.
5
1st time to dolce vita. I'm really impressed with the service. Very attentive and friendly staffs.. special mention to Vanessa and Felix.. was taking pic with my Friend and Vanessa came over offer to help us to take pic , the table quite empty as we are done with our dinner , she automatically brought a vase of flower to take picture for us. Really impressed! And Felix was very attentive , come to our table to check if the beef is fine for us. Definitely will return back soon again! Thank you for such a memorable night!
5
The staff were really professional and excellent with recommendations, will definitely be back there again
5
When it comes to set lunch, Dolce Vita is possibly the best all-rounder for an Italian restaurant. First there's al-fresco sitting next to the pool where you can get a pretty good view of Marina Bay Sands/ Singapore River. It's the perfect place for a slow, relaxing meal and a romantic date with your other half.Second, the lunch set allows you to choose any 2 or 3 courses from a selection of starters, pastas, mains and desserts as well as your choice of coffee/ tea. I had a pasta and main for $36++, and the portions were so substantial they can honestly feed 2!Personally the Arrabbiata didn't suit my taste, I'm guessing it's partly because I've a low tolerance level for spices. The pan-roasted chicken breast was however excellent. The sides are perfectly seared and browned, yet the texture is moist with none of the dryness you'd expect. The skin was also crispy and addictive. Last but not least, the service is the best I've encountered in recent times. My Korean (I'm guessing) server offered me newspapers to read while waiting for the food, and without being asked to, he served some ingredients that I had reservations about separately. He also walked by every once in a while to check that everything's ok and filled my glass very promptly throughout the meal despite the fact that i was the only one seated outdoors where there were no servers in sight. In between my 2 courses, he also offered me a bowl of assorted nuts to munch on. Absolutely delightful! Choices on the ala-carte menu are unfortunately quite limited and prices are generally a notch above its competitors. I only see myself returning to try 1 other dish, which is a real pity as I really enjoyed my dining experience and hope to see more items that interest me
4
Good service. Is my hubby's birthday and they offered a complimentary cake for him. Nice gesture from the restaurant
3
table was tilted and when request to change , the restaurant waiter advise no other table available. bit disappointing as we they should know that the table condition is not good and shall replace 
5
Just a quick business lunch meeting with a few Colleagues and food was spectacular form the first appetizer through the desert! Really fresh food, appealing to your eyes and the service was quite magnificent.I loved at the end of the lunch, when they approached to you with a trolley with a selection of chocolates! It was really a nice touch to finish the meal.Pasta cooked perfectly with the right flavour of black truffle!Thank you for the experience
5
There is nothing to fault on this restaurant, the setting is perfect, the service is just superb and the food is beyond excellent... they deliver every timeStarters were varied and interesting, mains really excellent with fish dishes excelling. Flavours, preparation and presentation were first class.If you're a vegetarian the menu at first looks limited... but they will cook a dish that you want ... and the chef and team are really accommodating to dietary needs....Would highly recommend and it will always be on the list when visiting Singapor
4
For a restaurant in a top quality hotel like the Mandarin Oriental I would have expected much better food. Don't get me wrong, this is a very good restaurant, but compared to other top restaurants this was mediocre. The good: soup, carpaccio, breads, dessert. Would come back just for the bread. View is also great.Not so good: the veal! Very dry and tough. Expensive for what you get. Portions are small
5
We dined here the second night of our stay at the Mandarin Oriental. Our meal was exquisite in every way from the delectable food to the personalized service. All our dishes were magnificently presented and tasted devine with a perfect combination of flavours. This trip was to celebrate our 43rd Wedding Anniversary and we were even serenaded by two wonderful young ladies at the completion of our meal and presented with red roses. We cannot wait to return to Singapore and experience this wonderful restaurant again.
5
Dolce Vita has Authentic italian taste. If you take the oudoor sitting you get a breathtaking view of the Marina Bay sands and merlion park. Being at height (5 th floor) generally it is nice breeze and you can enjoy your drinks and dinner outside.Service is Amazing. We wanted no Onion and No garlic and they made few things out of the menu..Amazing! very courteous and helpful staff. Chef sent us few things to taste exclusively for us.
5
Very nice Italian restaurant. I would defiantly rate this as five star dining and reccomend to all. Both the service and food is excellent
4
Dolce vita used to be one of my favourite dining place till more than a year ago, i noticed that the standard of the food dropped quite a fair bit. Decided to revisit it recently and wow i am amazed! I ordered a barramundi and it was one of the most beautifully plated dish. The fish was fresh and tender, served with homemade ricotta cheese and mussels. Simply delish. The warm chocolate tart was also perfectly executed, with a molten centre encased by a crisp buttery tart. The only complain that i have is that the aircon was just way too cold
5
Ate here whilst staying in the Mandarin Oriental. Fabulous food in an excellent location . Can dine inside or out with a fabulous atmosphere. Great selection of food and wine. Service is attentive but not intrusive and Paneer and his colleagues are professional and welcoming. The Mozzarella starter is not to be underestimated. Fabulous quality and enough to share. The pasta dishes we had, particularly the Tagliolini with truffles and veal jus just made you wish for more. The Chocolate tart with a melted hot chocolate centre is a perfect end to one of the best dining experiences we had. So much so we went back again later in the week. Ate the same thing but as all freshly prepared each slightly different so a new experience and no less amazing for it
5
Very nice ambience and the staff is friendly. we ordered the steak and duck, both are good. The wine they introduced was great but ex. I will be going back again
4
The outside area is the most preferred despite the heat that Singapore offers you. The service is very good and frequent with a great menu of well presented and yummy tasting food. Wine list is vast and there is a choice of the cheaper end bottles which is nice surprise as Singapore punishes wine drinkers with a large sin tax. The one thing i will say is that the inside of the restaurant is not very warm and comfortable.could do with some charm and also the piped music is awful . So if that could be changed you may get more people eating inside. The odd screaming kid by the pool might also be distracting, but hard to avoid
5
Had lunch here. Very appetising and delicious.Service to match.Can dine indoors or outdoors next to pool
5
It had been a while since i last visited this restaurant and it's still as good as i remembered it. Attentive service staff helped to contribute to the wonderful evening.
5
Had an excellent dinner at Dolce Vita. Both food and service were first class. The staff were excellent, with a caring and welcoming attitude. They also showed a really good knowledge of the drinks and food menu. Questions about what gins and rums were available were answered knowledgeably. Suggestions were offered on choice of dishes but not forced on us.The food was excellent. I had a delicious cauliflower soup with scallop, followed by a tender and flavourful tenderloin. I chose a cheese taster for desert, which included a wonderful Gorgonzola cheese. This was accompanied with a raspberry jam and the combination of this with the whole grain toast was fantastic, although a bit strong for some tastes. All our meals were excellent.I have been lucky enough to eat at two Michelin starred restaurants recently in Singapore and this was at least equal to those. Well done
5
Food was excellent, I had the pigeon, it was perfectly cooked, tender and very tasty.The burrata was so fresh and tasted amazing!Putting aside that food cannot be really commented as it's just perfection, the service shall be highlighted too...With lots of attention to details, kind gestures and professionalism, the service was spot on!!! A great experience that I would recommend to everybody! Everything was just fantastic. Thanks to them!
5
Friday night and we were one of only 3 tables. Most surprised. The menu and food are good, but the wine list is excellent. Even better is the service. A thoroughly pleasant evening and a greatly underrated Italian restaurant in a city with few good Italians.
5
Was here with the family for their brunch. Service was exceptional and the food was quality without doubt. While it is supposed to be a Buffett, you help yourself to the stater and bread and the rest you order from a menu and served to the table. Food was fresh and well prepared and we probably had one of the better Italian food meal in town ever. We had 2 kids with us and they had ala carte, which was outside the brunch menu and they did help themselves to some 'dolce' without any fuss. The restaurant Was beside the pool and had a nice view of the city. Make for a nice weekend meal with a lazy setting. All in all, it was a very pleasant experience as both the food as well as service being 1 st rate
4
Dinner with a friend, great selection of tasteful dishes presented in a beautiful way. Quiet and relaxing atmosphere with very attentive and service minded staff.Truly enjoyed the venue and the ambience. Great to start with a sunset drink and move onto dining table after dark. Pool side restaurant
3
We probably had the entire restaurant to ourselves. Very relaxed ambience with view of the pool... started with some foamy thing but they did not come round to explain what it was as it was not on the menu... 1st up.. poached egg was really yummy with black truffle.. next, the risotto was a tad bland for our liking... felt it was more like baby food... oops! The set menu had 2 mains but not sure why they did not check with us what we would like... we found it odd later when they just served beef throughout the table and there were folks that they couldn't take beef... last came the warm chocolate tart... was a good finish to the meal but felt it was a little rich... Overall nice meal, may return to give their other dishes a try
4
I went there with my boyfriend for a nice dinner, food was good but not excellent, the place is nice near the pool with a nice view. Service was great and the waitress was very nice and helpful. It is overall expensive, I think you can find better value in other restaurants in the city.I am however disappointed by the service at the mandarin oriental, personel outside of the restaurant isn't nice or helpful, they just look at you while they see you are waiting for something, they do not show much care which is unexpected in this kind of hotel
5
The food was very good. The service was commendable. I will surely come back. Thank you for taking care of us.
4
A beautiful restaurant with excellent menu for lunch. Service was wonderful and food delicious. The restaurant is beside the pool and has lovely view over the harbour and tourist sites
5
Superb evening, spectacular food & a wonderful personal service that made us feel totally welcome & appreciated!! My husband had his wrist in a cast so the staff made sure that the chef cut his food to bite size portions. I recommend the light smoked lobster salad as a start to you meal, a memorable dish
4
The service and surroundings are fantastic. Food is good, but the selection of mains and starters could be a bit more extensive
4
The setting in Mandarin Oriental is always classy right from the lobby. Dolce Vita has a great view over the marina and Singapore's southern sea, a good place to relax and enjoy the sunset with a sundowner! We had a wonderful four course dinner here with freinds. The resturant is spacious, with fantastic outdoor seating and impeccable service. Decoration is subtle and comfortable with a touch of class and style. Cuisines are authentic, produce are fresh and presentations are impressive. Young and talented kitchen team. Their special Riserva Acquerello risotto is most unforgettable, a dish I would come back for more
4
Dolce Vita is situated at the outdoor pool level of the MO hotel, it has an open view of the Marina Bay and the pool. It has a nice ambiance especially in the early evening over sunset.My friend and I had dinner at the restaurant and had a nice time. We had the burrata, beef carpaccio, hand made tagiolini with black truffle, lasagna (25 layers), and the white asparagus risotto with yuzu, which was quite refreshing.We liked the taste of the dishes that were flavorsome and succulent. The wine list was intelligently assembled that go well with the food.Service was nice and friendly but would expect a bit more finesse at MO standards. For example, one would not expect to see water dripping onto the dinner's table when pouring from the bottle and then left unattended.It's a nice idea to retire to the outdoor balcony over desserts and drinks while enjoying the night scenes of Marina Bay.Dolce Vita

So, we went to this restaurant expecting an exquisite Italian fare given the name. And, the last time we were there several months ago we had enjoyed the Italian cuisine tremendously.Boy, were we wrong to expect the same this time. This time was sometime after first week of April this year and the restaurant was having some Dutch offering by some Dutch guest Chef.They offered some mousse this and mousse that - such dated pretentious cooking method that was once fashionable to impress the young and inexperienced.We left feeling jibed and had to have a burger to satisfy our taste buds for something substantial and real
4
This restaurant is next to the pool. They serve at the pool. The service was prompt and friendly. We had pizza, which was very good. This is much better than bar food or food you might expect poolside. The view is beautiful. Highly recommended
5
Back again after a while and found out that they have changed their menu. Loved their mushroom soup and so was quite disappointed. However, the new menu was still excellent and the carbonara was very delicious. Dolce Vita us probably our favourite place for Italian food in Singapore. Great service, delicious food, and great value for money.
5
We went for lunch with clients. Choose the set menu (you can change the dessert options) and presentation is top class (fitting a Michelin 2 restaurant). There is also a vegetarian option in set menu (you have to specific ask for it)
1
Called to make a reservation but had to pay a deposit due to a special event. I needed to double check with my wife so they said they would send an email to me with a link for the deposit. Excellent. Gave my email and verified it. Called my wife to confirm and was good to go. Waited for email .... No email. Called again at 8 pm to double check but the reservation staff had all left for the day. No worries I was told they would call first thing at 8 am in the morning. Confirmed my email again. Morning came... Still no email and no call. I called at 10 am and was put on hold .... For a long time ... No answer . Hung up and made a reservation elsewhere. Later the reservation staff called up and wanted to confirm insisting that they sent the email. Too late for me .. I had already moved on. Very disappointing .. Not what I have come to expect from the Mandarin Orienta
5
The restaurant has recently undergone a re furbishment and is more simpatico and physically welcoming as a result but the layoff has not altered the trajectory of the food outcomes, they continue to excel. The Vitello Tonnato reminded me that the tastes are authentic, routed in Italian home cooking, but the execution is thoroughly modern a perfect blend of taste and texture as well as visually enticing. For the main course I had the Pigeon Breast. Pidgeon is very easy to over cook leaving it dry and unappetising this was superb and the accompanying jus full of flavour, the kind of outcome that comes from a perfectly executed reduction.The desert, chocolate tart, was in the category "Non Comprende ?" How do you offer such a wonderful crust with the heavenly gooey inside. I prefer to eat inside in a more controlled temperature and atmosphere whilst you look at the dazzling lights of night time Singapore but the tables outside can give you a more street feel and you can alter the feeling and menu choice accordingly. Thank you again for another memorable evening of exquisite cooking offered in style by the Maitre De and his team
5
Excellent!!! Great view, great food!! Risotto!! Red Italian wine! Newly renovated. Inside favourite hotel: Manderin Oriental! @marinaba
5
As mentioned in my hotel review nothing was too much trouble. Felix and the wonderful Vanessa made our evening special and went out of their way to deal with my garlic allergy. Thank you so muc
4
Lovely setting by the pool with views over the city if you sit outside. Previously been very impressed with this restaurant and regularly ate here during my stays. Was not quite up to the same standard (food and service) on this visit but hopefully just an off day
4
Wonderful experience and Allen take specially good of us. Our client loves the food and ambience. The view of the pool side makes us feels relaxed and the location in the proximity of the bay area let's us showcase the skyline of Singapore Financial district
5
The best foccacia, mozzarela, avocado, tomato and pesto sandwhich ever combined with amazing views of Singapor
5
The Italian restaurant along the pool of the Mandarin Oriental pool offers fantastic food and great outdoor seating with views on Marina Bay. We had a very pleasant late lunch last week on one of the few sunny days. The tagliatta for two was actually one of the best on the bone tomahawk steaks I have ever eaten. It came with potatoe purée and mixed vegetables and was sliced into two portions by one of the very attentive and friendly waiters. All the dishes at our table of four were excellent. A truly "dolce farniente" great lunch with excellent service. A definite must repeat!
5
Staff welcoming, warm and interested in your requirements,Great restaurant along Mandarin Oriental pool , great view on Marina bay . Excellent italian food with good service from attentive staff.
5
This restaurant serves one of the best Italian Food in my experience in Singapore. This is located in Mandarin Oriental along the bay so try a clear day and sit out beside the pool as the view is great. The view of the city below, the towering Marina Bay Sand Towers ahead and it is quiet and peaceful. Apart from the view, the set menu options for lunch are the one to try and it made a super birthday lunch for me. Service was attentive, spaced which was good with all the food, house wine was good and the restaurant even gave me my own birthday cake. It is worth a try at this great place
5
From the moment you step through the door of this restaurant you know the experience is going to be great. Staff welcoming, warm and interested in your requirements.Started with the buffalo mozzarella and wow, it was as good as any I've tried elsewhere, very rich.Main meal and we both had the pasta bolognese which was very tasty - a variation on the traditional bolognese and the restaurant pulls it off to perfection.Overall an excellent evening and would thoroughly recommend this restaurant
5
Great restaurant along Mandarin Oriental pool , great view on Marina bay .Excellent italian food with good service from attentive staf
5
We had a great table overlooking the Harbour and Bay and started with a MOËT Chandon Champagne and some beautiful Italian meats.Just as we were about to proceed to our main course the Rock Band started their rehersal performance for the New Years Eve production and we moved inside the main restaurant which was somewhat quieter!I can highly recommend the American Steak, tasted superb with delicate vegetables. The fish dish was also superb and we finished with Italian Ice CreamService was truly outstanding and the Restaurant Manager one of the best I have come across, definately a visit here should be considered
5
The food compared to Italy based Italian food would be average at best. It you say that it is inspired by Italian food concepts, the rating goes up to excellent. The tastes and textures are finer than normal Italian fare but if you're expecting a traditional italian style or taste you'll be disappointed. The hit of the meal was thier Tiramisu version. The normal italian Tiramisu deserts leave you feeling overstuffed and over sugared. Dolce Vita's version leaves you comfortably refreshed.Selection of drinks and wines is outstanding. Service was very attentive.Be prepared to spend $150 - $200 US for drinks, starters, mains, a desert and a couple glasses of wine. But it does measure up to the price
5
I stayed in MO Singapore and what better way to enjoy the nice pool view by dining at the pool side?The food just worth the price and the service are exemplary. The lamb chop is just gorgeous and the soup was just beautiful. My father and I had a great time having dinner there and will definitely come back the next time I stay in this hotel
1
The service, while very polite, was extremely slow and the food was almost universally terrible. Several dishes had a bitter after taste suggestive of having been frozen and the serving sizes were comically small, even for fine dining with an astronomical pricetag. Avoid at all costs, there are thousands of restaurants in Singapore, don't waste your time here
3
Located next to the pool at the marina mandarin hotel this restaurant is decent but not something that I think is one of the better Italian places to eat in Singapore
4
We had a great saty at the Dolce Vita at Manderin Oriental. We were greeted by nice staff and they accommodated us to a change of seats away from the evening sun. The food was excellent and we enjoyed the white wine and desserts. Finishing the evening at the lounge area with a nightcap. Definitely recommend this place for couples night out
5
Recently visited dolce vita restaurant to celebrate my fiancé 's birthday ... We came to know about their Friday night Chef's Table through one our friends ... So we decided to try their 6 course dinner set menu with wine pairing for each course . Chef was very interactive and explained about the culture and cuisine of Italy in a very friendly manner . You get to know about some great wines as well ... It was a fabulous experience for us .. For those who wants to have a unique dining experience , dolce vita chefs table will fulfill the expectations without leaving any question :)
4
underrated Italian at the Mandarin Oriental by the pool over looking Marina Bay, nice food, good service, nice wines, great for couple
4
It was my first time at Dolce Vita and I wasn't sure what to expect. The tasting menu looked good but my friend and I decided to go for a la carte. What caught our attention was the fact that the pasta was available as tasting portion or main depending on our appetites. We got the burrata and Parma ham as an appetiser, the red prawn pasta and the lobster pasta. We were definitely not disappointed as the ingredients used in the appetiser was very fresh! It is definitely the best burratas I've had thus far. Pasta were above expectations as well. Additionally, the staff was very attentive, friendly and sensitive with our needs and timing as to when to ask if we were ready to order. Overall, we were really impressed and would go back again if we ever crave Italian food
4
Went there for dinner in July and really enjoyed it. The service was very attentive and personal. When we told the wait staff that we would like to share the soup, she arranged with the kitchen to serve the soup in two different bowls. We did not even have to ask. To enjoy a quiet meal, ask for a seat inside. It can get quite noisy if you sit by the pool. Would definitely return soon
5
Just came by for a drink at the pool and decided to grab a bite after i saw the menu. Service was extremely friendly and was paying attention to every single detail. I only eat 1 of the 3 butter they served with the bread and the waiter must have realized it and served me a second one. Unfortunately I forgot the name but I must make a compliment to the German Restaurant manager who has obviously done a great job to train his team. Will be back
4
Very attentive service and a excellent setting....i would recommend the entrance side that overlooks the bay rather than the pool side as people are swimming directly in front of you.The usual excellent MO service and very good food makes this a great choice for a business dinner
2
I went with a group of 8. This is a different type of brunch, they bring out food and you share in the middle. Was a nice concept and experience but the food was average. For the price I expected better. Staff were helpful but I had to keep asking for them to top up my wine which was annoying as the champagne drinkers did not have to. (Or maybe I was just drinking too fast). Paying was the real headache. They pour the last drink at 3pm but at 5pm we were still waiting to pay. I asked for more wine at 4:30pm as we had waited 90 minutes to pay and they declined. Leaving us twirling our thumbs eager to leave. If they had simply given us a top up we wouldn't had minded the delay. But they declined and that's why they are getting this review. The girl who declined was very polite though and that's why they get 2 stars.
4
Had lunch with 3 guests. Two of us ordered the set and the other two ala carte. Mushroom soup was excellent. Grilled king prawn was good but could have been cut through the middle for a better grill. Tiramisu was nice but the flat white was flat
4
Very polite and friendly service. Book a table inside is much better in my opinion! Foods were nice, but it took ages!
5
This was our third visit to Dolce Vita and we have experienced consistently good service and food every time.There were no complaints from us except that we were too full by the end of the night!Thank you to the staff for making our visit memorable as always
5
The food is very good and the price is worth to paid but the most surprise me is the best service,all the servers offer me friendly service,excellent!!!!!
5
I think this has to be one of the best restaurants in Singapore. Well cooked Italian food, sitting outside (if you like the heat) the views over the bay are stunning. All the food is carefully prepared, the waiters are knowledgeable and efficient. Food comes at the pace you want it. Dishes are amazing, faultless.. well presented, cooked to perfection and delicious. It isn't cheap, but you get top quality. Thank you to the team...a great evening
5
Service is good very attentive...The promotion white asparagus with poach egg was amazing...Will definitely visit again ..
5
Revisited Dolce Vita last month to celebrate my hubby's great achievement at work (yeah, we're always celebrating the little moments ). We were pleasantly surprised with the personal effort put in by staff/supervisor, Vanessa, way before our arrival. We would cherish the beautiful hat that bore your personal artwork. ❤️ Food was great once again. We tried the new Sunday lunch (it was a 3 or 4 course). The manager and chef came around to welcome us too. Keep it up, all staff at Dolce Vita
2
Went for dinner with a friend. Chose to sit outdoors only to have our seats just 10 steps away from the pool with swimmers watching us as we ate...JOKE! While the servers were evidently polite, they certainly lack professionalism and experience. It started with Mr Mukesh who brought us our wine but the bottle that he pored from wasn't enough from 2 glasses and we literally waited 10mins for him to return. My friend spotted residues in his wine glass!! The female server whose name I didn't catch took for granted on her cutlery placement without even asking whose having what..another JOKE!Now for the food1. We were served UNDERCOOKED risotto2. The Foie Gras that I had was chilled and the apricot sauce was just too overpowering.3. My Tenderloin that I ordered @ 68SGD didn't do much justice either. Wasn't seared to perfection..meat was kind of dry..We didn't bother to have Dolci. To sum it all up...our experience was destroyed. My friend asked if the chef who prepared our risotto was Italian - the answer given was YES! To the kitchen and the management of DOLCI VITA...thanks heaps for RUINING our dinner. And please, NEVER EVER remove anything from my bill without my approval....that's utter embarrassment to me....surely being able to dine at such establishments would mean I can afford to pay for my dues and definitely NOT a typical FREE LOADER
4
Amazing Saturday bubbly brunch! And choice of Champagne is bar none - only place in Singapore to offer (R de) Ruinart for their brunch pouring, which is legendary!!Format of the brunch is a la carte style - a decent selection of starters and mains you can order off the menu, followed by an array of sweet treats at the end. Have to say service is pretty schmick - if you have Mukesh, Jan and Taylor serving your table - you're in it for a great experience. Friendly, professional and hospitable. Awesome job guys! If you're a foodie (like us!), the starters offered are pretty much the real McCoy, only thing is but if you do love your oysters, do be vocal and ask early, because they are served last (surprisingly) and tend to be quite limited. Nonetheless, with a little persistence, the guys came through with it splendidly. Top picks other than oysters are the mushroom veloute and the beef carpaccio. Overall, a fantastic experience all round. Will be back with more friends in tow
5
Lovely meal with great service ! Will come back again ! Couldn't find any mistakes . White asparagus with scallop was wonderfully prepared !
5
we really enjoyed the meal sitting outside by the pool watching the fireworks, superb veal dish with fresh truffles and anchovy sauce was out of this world. Very good wine by the glass and great service. Would recommen

Dolce Vita is inside the Mandarin Oriental hotel. You have to go outside to their roof pool level to get to the restaurant. Not surprisingly its a very good hotel italian restaurant. Service is very attentive, although one of the waiter walked on to me by mistake. The food is good but not great. Very safe but of high quality. Since its by the pool you do see all the guests walking around in robes and swimsuit. It was pretty good place for business dinne
5
we always visit Dolce Vita whenever we have a special occassion. Kudos to the team! excellent staffs as always! Th service you can never find anywhere in Singapore. WHite asparagus with the truffle must try!
5
We visited as part of a special celebration. The staff couldn't do enough for us, including a photo, a cake and excellent service. We have eaten all over the UK and Italy and without a doubt this was the best Italian food we've had
5
Great quality of food, excellent service, and Ruinart champagne wasn't bad too.A little different to other similar brunches as the dishes are served to your table rather than being buffet style.Still a wide selection however, and you're able to order more of whatever you like.A reasonably formal setting but with a good atmosphere.Would recommend
5
Went to The Dolce Vita Restaurant twice during our 3 Day stay @ The Mandarin Oriental Hotel & it was perfection. The View is outstanding, sitting @ an outside table by the Swimming Pool & looking at The Marina Bay Sands (Boat Hotel) & the Fantastic Singapore skyline was Amazing. The Food was a bit Pricey but Top Notch with great Presentation. The service was First Class & a big Thanks to Felix, Joan , & Vanessa for looking after us, would highly reccomend to anyon
5
Went here during my business meeting and the service was superb. Food was awesome we ordered pasta and risotto which is really good. Portion though is very small but tastes really good. Hope to meet the chef one day.

We had ordered lunch here and was overall impressed with the food that we decided to experience their dinner menu the same evening. Their pizza in the lunch menu was absolutely delicious whereas the pizza from their dinner menu for the kids was relatively hard with not enough cheese. The pomodoro pasta with cherry tomatoes the kids loved. Now for the soup, the bean soup pretty much tasted like what you would get from a tinned can, it pretty much lacked flavour. When you are nearly paying around that much for their soup you automatically expect it to have that home made taste to it. The chicken dish and fish was absolutely delicious and what you call fine dining and your money well spent. Service was five star however we were charged for still water twice when only one bottle was only ordered. This was later corrected only because I had brought it up. Suppose you would when a bottle of water costs 16 SGD!!!
5
Attentive staff, fabulous view and great food. Bit of a hidden gem. Have been a few times now and never disappointed
5
Our dining experience in 2014 was disappointing, but this dining experience was excellent.The food was of gourmet quality with both taste and texture.Special thanks to Taylor for making our evening enjoyable
5
Had an amazing lunch here on our last day. The food was superb! Staff attentive and knowledgeable. perfect
5
The style and service of DV exudes quality but it is the food that really excels. Authentic Italian combinations have been reinvented, the tuna and oil is turned into an exquisite emulsion and the pasta whilst cooked al dente is infused with a sophisticated sauce but based on rustic authentic ingredients. My main course of Lamb was cooked to perfection (pink) and the vegetables crunchy and vibrant though delicately presented. Similarly the deserts are deconstructed but retain the essential tastes of the traditions they are based on. The maitre de was supportive on wine choices and the tasting menu was accompanied by a number of treats which rounded out the meal perfectly
5
must try lobster pasta, ravioli and burrata! our forthtime visit and we always satisfied about the overall experience.The staffs are all friendly, smiling and attentive
5
Dolce Vita is where we return every year to celebrate different special occasions. We would like to specially mention a faithful server, Vanessa, who attended to our needs whenever we were there, for the past 4-5 years, showering us with such warmth, courtesy and attentiveness. Her observant eyes and warm smiles always make us feel belonged. Kudos to Dolce Vita for the overall quality of food, ambience and the wise hiring of impeccable staff
3
The "creamy" mozzarella cheese served with parma ham was too heavy on the quantity. The pasta was too salty and the shrimps too dry. Excellent attention from the staff who were very friendly and helpful
5
Excellent team of Dolce Vita by the chef and also the service staff.Never ever upset me with my special request.Visit with group of friends.Were greeted by Mukesh and direct us to our table.Britney was sweet and accommodating to our needs and special request, as well as Mukesh. Chef were great preparing my special orders.We were almost treated like a king in the evening. Specially like the bread with tomato pesto, we had few rounds of it. Main course were great, same as the dessert.Prefer to have more choices next time when we dine in.Keep up the good work
5
This is a great place for romantic dinner or an evening with friends. The view to MBS is amazing and the value is great.
3
Granted it was not the regular champagne brunch that other hotels serve, but the overall food quality of the brunch was disappointing. Only the oysters and champagne were the highlights. For $158++ per pax, you are probably better off ordering a la carte.
4
The service was excellent - our waiter (Kenneth) was very attentive and our glasses were always kept full. We were a party of 7 adults, a 5hr old and a baby. They asked what the 5yr old wanted and they warmed up the baby food. We asked to sit outside which was very pleasant, although as there were hotel guests swimming in the pool it was a lively, quite noisy ambience. The was a Santa who gave gifts to the little ones and carol singers who sadly did not visit us outside.The menu was interesting. About a dozen different starters are brought to the table and although the portions are small you can request more of any dish you like. The mains are brought out on the same principle with varied rice and pasta dishes (see menu from restaurant website). If you are looking for a traditional English style Xmas dinner this is not the place for you although there was one platter with turkey and a few sprouts. The deserts are buffet style with a brilliant selection, including a chocolate log and traditional Xmas pud
4
I can highly recommend this place if you want to have great food & service. The outdoor seating is at the pool with great view to MBS and the CBD. Our waitress, Joan, did a fantastic job. She was the main contributor that it was such a great experience. Joan is very lovely and super attentive! We had the tasting menu and all courses were superb. Another party had the "vitello tonnato" and the king prawns - both outstanding.Definitely a place to dine when you are staying at the Mandarin but also as a visitor. We certainly come back
5
The staff were very professional and I must say I had a great dining experience there! Service staff, especially Vanessa, impressed us with her superb service. We were there for our wedding anniversary dinner and the restaurant even surprised us with a card and our photo! Happy toKnow they went the extra mile to delight their customers. Food were impressive too. The risotto I had was flavourful. Their signature dessert - espresso tiramisu is really da bomb! Thumbs up!
5
We were staying in a harbour view suite at the Mandarin Oriental. The hotel had several restaurants and we chise this one to dine at on our first night. We were celebrating our wedding anniversary, so they gave us a souvenir photograph and a celebratory dessert. Superb service and superb food. Highly recommended
5
Another great service and excellent dining experience. Great food and great chef recommendation. Chef Omar truly knows what we want as well as the service render by Felix and team. Great smoothie from Steven. Dolce vita always Wow me with what I wanted despite item is not in the menu. No doubt still my favorite restaurant
4
The food, the service and the setting were all very good.The main courses really should come wth some vegetables at this price though.They also forgot the cake that they had promised for my wife's birthday.Not great value for money but wonderful setting for a special celebration.
5
Dolce Vita is a nice chill out bar next to the swimming pool providing a nice view on the hotel pool area, the bay, MBS and Singapore skyline from a single sight
4
Although in many countries restaurants inside a hotel are often not as good as separate restaurant this does not apply for Singapore and this Italian restaurant on the 5th floor of the Mandarin Oriental hotel is a wonderful example of that. If you make a reservation you can sit outside and enjoy the beautiful view of the lake within Singapore with a nice light show at 8pm.Great Italian dishes accompanied by beautiful wines (both Italian and nonitalian) give you a perfect meal during the evening.
4
The dinner is delicious and the waitress is attentive to all my needs.They even prepare a mini birthday cake for my husband and sing the birthday song.
5
I was staying at the Mandarin Oriental in Singapore, and whilst there dined at this restaurant. It was a nice relaxed environment with a nice decor.There was a good selection of Italian dishes, and a nice selection of wines and beers. Although Singapore was hazy at the time, there was a good view over the swimming pool, with a choice of indoor or outdoor dining.We choose to dine in doors, which was very nice. I choose the soup, followed by the cod dish. Food was excellent. Ice cream for dessert to finish off the evening. The lighting is intriguing, Being a photographer I played with the light a little between courses. In fact it looks like a dinosaur egg all lit up. How pleasant!! The staff are attentive, the environment relaxed, and an ideal setting for dinner. I thoroughly enjoyed the dining experience and would return at any time
4
We always think if we eat in the hotel we would consider it to be a travel fail, however after 4 days of being out and about eating chili et al we decided to try what is thought to be the best Italian in Singapore.The food was excellent, the only problem was that we felt we were in a time machine Being sped into the future ! The staff were so efficient they were bringing our mains when I was still eating the insalata! I think they need to understand that we wanted to have a relaxed and longer experience eating dinner. Due to the rush we had eaten three courses in only one hour! When we had finished we didn't have time to ask for another bottle of wine or pudding because our waitress had already removed EVERYTHING!We had no choice but to go to the bar next to the pool to sit and let our food digest. A huge shame given we had such a great experience in the hotelThe food is worth going just make sure they aren't ordering your meals before they have clearedthe current cours
5
Went for Italian dinner. Had the mushroom soup and Caprese Salad. Food was very tasty, well presented with high quality ingredients. Excellent place for dinner
5
The food was great each plate was perfectly plated. The service staff describe to us each food on our plate
5
Great food. Great drinks and serve by excellent staffs! well done dolce vita! you never stop amazing me! thank ypu for all the surprises during my birthday!thank you do
4
I had the chance to be invited at Dolce Vita druing a short stay in Singapore.I was delighted by the city view, the pool and the food. Although the service was a bit slow but good and of quality otherwise, the food was just great so I had a fabulous dinner 
4
A wonderfully located restaurant on Level 5 by the pool with stunning city views. Food sounds very nice but was average Service is fantastic and the waiters are attentive and knowledgabl
1
We decided to go based upon the TripAdvisor recommendations but were not pleased with the service nor the price or the swimming pool right next to the table where people were jumping in the water. Service was very slow and the prices were absolutely ridiculous for what you got. We wish we would have known they were going to charge us $14 for water per person before ordering or we would have brought the hotel water from our room which was free. Insane that they would charge so much! We won't be coming back and would not recommend this place to anyone. There are much better restaurants close by with better views and better prices
5
Excellent Italian based food using clearly the best ingredients which resulted in the flavours and tastes we got.Great service, nice pool outlook, good place to be
5
My wife and I have eaten at Dolce Vita a few times for special occasions (anniversary, birthday etc). Each time we come we are never disappointed with the high standard of food and service. The staff is extremely attentive and helpful without being overbearing, and you never feel like you can ask for too much. The food is excellent - I guess it's a more modern take on traditional Italian but the taste is superb and portion size is just right. It is not a cheap night out, but for those special occasions or when you just feel like spoiling yourself or your loved ones, this restaurant is definitely worth it
5
I would like to sum up my review by only stating that if the food lacked a little taste that was easily covered up with the excellent service and friendliness of the staff. In my case both the food and service was phenomenal. The restaurant manager (Indian guy) and the waitress who served me (a Filipino lady) both were excellent. The manager suggested me options being a vegetarian and even customized the pasta requested. It was a birthday celebration and was made excellent.The food was nothing short of spectacular in terms of taste and the view when you are seated outside the restaurant is amazing. It gives you a complete view of the Marina Bay Sands and the Singapore skyline. Its definitely worth a visit for Italian food
4
service was a little slow at first but they sprung into action and we were treated very well. excellent with the children. good wine recommendations and the food was excellent. restaurant is next to the swimming pool. there is a bar area in "prime' position overlooking the bay. it is an odd setting. fine dining next to the hotel pool. strange. it would seem possible to have the restaurant in a more prominent position overlooking the bay and the pool separated somehow. that aid, the food was excellent so no complaint
5
One of the best fine dining experience ever in my life..it was really awesome..some Amazing foods from the globe..especially the Duck Lever & Salmon is great..one should not miss out in life..great Staffs ..nice ambience..felt like a king..Thanks Team..Had a wonderful experience.

DV was a long favorite in Singapore and justifiably ranks highly on TripAdvisor plus other review sites. I last ate here prior to this visit over 3 years ago and a lot has changed since that visit, notably the chef who as per normal is Italian.Situated on the pool deck level of the MO it affords diners (who eat outside) the perfect view of the Bay and the city Skyline. Also being next to the swimming pool and in an elevated position there is usually a breeze to keep the place less humid.We ate the starter of insalate caprese. The restaurant gives the salad a different name but it is essentially caprese. Buffalo tomatoes with moist mozzarella comes served with rocket (instead of the standard basil leaf) and olive soil - essentially finely chopped black olives. The combination works very well and the portion is large enough for two to share. For main my wife ate the red prawn spaghetti. Be warned the spaghetti is homemade, fresh and slightly thicker than you may be used to - more udon than linguine but you can always substitute of you so choose. The whole dish had a strong smell of the sea - in a very good fresh way....not the often been sitting in the fridge for too long way. Very tasty. Very juicy and at 40 SGD not bad value either for fine dining. I ate the pumpkin and gruyere ravioli. These little parcels were packed with flavor as a result of the saltiness of the gruyere, the sweetness of the pumpkin and the savory explosion from the veal jus. I remember 6 good sized ravioli and these were enough to leave me full but not uncomfortably so. No room for desert. We accompanied this with a bottle of the Margaret River Chardonnay which worked well. This has been the house pour for as long as I can remember at the MO and this tells you a lot about the quality and value of a house wine. 2 diners - one starter, two mains and a bottle of wine came to 270 SGD inclusive. More than a run of the mill Italian restaurant but this is far from run of the mill so actually represented good value. As always - legendary service from the MO staff from the waiter filling the water glass (which was never allowed to run dry), the server and the manager. All in all a good team delivering a quality product. The final nice touch is the ability to relocate from the dining table to the bar terrace - the Bar at 5 - to finish what wine is left or to sit with a digestif and a cigar.
5
A fantastic venue for a quiet Sunday brunch amongst friends. The service was excellent and unobtrusive, thanks to Vanessa and Taylor. Their Sunday lunch is well known in Singapore so we went along to try it and we're not disappointed. The lunch was a cross between a true buffet and a la carte. The mushroom soup with truffle foam was a particular favourite. The free flow kept coming and oiled the conversation and jovial atmosphere. It was an added bonus that after lunch we sat in the pool surrounds and took in the sights of the city across Marina Bay
5
Lovely Italian restaurant situated next to the pool outside on the deck. Can have a relaxed lunch time meal under the verandah, a snack and coffee in the outside pavilion or a tremendous meal inside the restaurant day or night. I was there during the Food Festival with a visiting chef from Italy. Although I am vegetarian, he consulted with me as to my likes and created a special menu just for me. All staff were super attentive and make you feel special
1
the service is good. but the food taste horrible. even frozen food taste better. went with 3 friends and all of us are terribly disappointed. no wonder I don't see locals there. only tourist will go there.\!!!!!!
5
service was perfect! and the food was tasty, next time I will visit this place again for sure! And I think that singapore is the best place to discover many asian cuisines
5
After a week in Singapore we were looking for something more close to home. The food was divine (caprese salad, pasta with prawns, delicious bread)... The food was great but the best and most remarkable was the service...from the time we got in the restaurant to the time we left I have really felt a VIP. Definitely a great option for anyone in the area mainly for guest like us that were on the four seasons and the restaurants are closed. Just few steps ....
5
First time visit for lunch. It was not busy during the weekdays. The Restaurant offers great quality food with decent pricing.We had the three course set menu. Mukesh which I believe the restaurant manage who seat us near by the window out looking the stunning skycrapers of singapore.Menu was presented by Mukesh and clearly explain to us the menu.Britney take our beverage order and serve promptly.Presentation of the food was excellent. Starter veal was great same as the heavenly mushroom soup.Main course Fillet di Manzo was cook to perfect doneness. great service from Britney and Mukesh and also Steven who was the bartender making our special drinks.Enjoy every moment with Dolce Vita
4
Had a really nice Saturday brunch here with friends recently. It's really nice to be served at your table and to be able to ask for more of dishes you like. All the food was deliciously, I especially liked to lamb and the mushroom soup. Would definitely go back!
5
I had dinner at Dolce with a colleague on June 13.We arrived early for our 6:30 reservation (their opening) so we were seated at the lounge deck. It was a warm Singapore evening but there was a nice breeze and awesome view of the Marina Bay.The ambience of Dolce is very "open" and Mediterranean, overlooking the pool and the Marina. At dinner, the lighting makes it very cozy and intimate. A winner for romantic dinners which, unfortunately, mine was not.I had the mozzarella salad to start, a risotto a la puttanesca with cuttlefish as second and a cod fish as main. They were all delicately prepared and light on the palette. A real delight. The service staff was most attentive, helpful with the menu and accommodating with special requests. They made multiple checks about food allergies, too.The only disappointment was that we were too full to sample the dolce or desserts. And maybe that it seemed a tad too dark. But i don't intend to be overly picky.Dining the la Dolce Vita way was a great treat. Definitely a regular on my preferred culinary destinations
4
Dolce Vita means Sweet Life. The place had a nice atmosphere, especially in the evening. The setting of the restaurant was great, not impressive, but great. They interpreted Italian cuisine nicely. The Tiramisu was excellent, and so was the pasta, the presentation was great. Great choices of drinks. Well worth the money, and looking to return when I visit sâ€™pore next time.Tips: If you're on a budget, thet i will not recomend this restaurant to you. Make the reservation call, or you might not get any place available
5
The setting is beautiful, not impressive, but it offers a very enjoyable view of the Marina Bay area and overlooking the lovely hotel pool. Italian cuisine is world-renowned, but still finding an italian restaurant with such a perfect interpretation of it so far from Italy is a bless. All the dishes were nicely presented and the taste was as expected readding the menu. The wine list is undisputable.Maybe some of the personnel manners could be more in tone with the setting. If you crave italian and you are in the area, this should be your destination
5
Came for dinner on a weekend and had a wonderful time. From the time we entered the restaurant we could sense that it was going to be a memorable experience. That's how the service staff made us feel. And they carried this through right till we left. Food tasted great and they do take great pains with the presentation. We had the tasting menu which comprised an antipasti, pasta, main and dessert. We added a soup to the order as well as an additional main. But in the end we felt that we could have done without the additional main. Nevertheless we did finish the food as it would have been an injustice to leave leftovers. The cost was higher than some of the other Italian restaurants we have been to but we were very satisfied with our overall experience. I can hardly find any area to complain about. There are a few more items on the menu we would like to try and that would certainly mean a return trip. Well done to the staff of Dolce Vita
5
We had a superb meal and great service. The restaurant is attractive with both inside and outdoor dining. All the staff are very attentive. Our starters and mains arrived piping hot and beautifully presented and extremely tasty. We had white asparagus in season, then sea bass wrapped in bacon. The waiter sensibly asked if we had any allergies before bring the amuse bouche. It was mussel based and I was brought an alternative as I do have an allergy. The restaurant is expensive but it is excellent for service, taste and ambience. Highly recommend
5
Great service, Great food. Indoor and outdoor dining options. Were extremely accommodating despite arriving 10 mins prior to closing. Large space - good for business lunches.
5
Excellent Lunch with great wine list, from Italian to French wines and even Saumur Champigny to drink chilled. I really enjoyed my lunch $65++ per person.
5
Lovely authentic Italian dinner whilst sitting outside admiring the spectacular marina views. Highly recommend & very romantic.
5
the food and staff at the restaurant were fantastic. The food was sublime and the staff could not do enough for you. The restaurant has great atmosphere and good views. A must if you are in Singapore and love Italian food.
5
Nice Italian restaurant at the pool on the terrace of the 5th floor of the Mandarin oriental. We had a wonderful dinner there. Food is delicious and Italian.
5
Dolce Vita Offers brunches with pure spread of authentic European dishes. All dishes are served to the table instead of the pick all you want style; all of them are free flow. We absolutely love the appetizers here, from crab timbale, burrata mozzarella cheese stuffed in cherry tomato, port wine marinated foie gras terrine are refreshing, simulating and multi-dimensional in taste. The piping hot soups of mushroom, and those of cauliflower served in shot glasses respectively are sublime, being overflowing with flavours, the ham and oysters are good also. The pasta to been cooked to perfection. The fishes are good and fresh though not as great in taste as the appetizers. The star of the mains is the risotto with black truffle which is an aromatic cosiness . The desserts are extremely sinful; silky smooth in texture and rich in taste, high points for them. I love the gold flakes on the tiramisu and chocolate. The panna cotta is unbelievably good with its custard being the smoothest and most refreshing. Ricotta Cheese berries tart is very light, yet creamy at the same time, an absolute must try. The ambiance is very modern with a bit of the resort feel due to its location besides the swimming pool surrounded by lots of plants. The view outside of the restaurant is breath taking, where one can see Marina bay and the Singapore flyer. The service is very attentive, professional and friendly, absolutely faultless. We Will be back to try the set meals
5
Dolce Vita is a classic Italian restaurant that will never go wrong. They have one of the best service, food, and ambience, overlooking the picturesque Singapore skyline. The steak and foie gras is a must-try main dish. They serve freshly baked bread with 3 different dips. Do becareful as these piping hot bread and partners are so delicious that you may get carried away and may not be able to finish your steak ;). The restaurant is also located at the hotel's swimming pool, giving the atmosphere a very relax vibe especially if you are dining along the al fresco area during dinner
5
I was searching for a good restaurant on trip advisor and Dolce Vita caught my eye and I decided to give it a try. The service we had was simply stunning. Attentive but not intrusive, giving advise and guidance on the menu and their recommendations were spot on
5
Had an exquisite dinner on our last evening in Singapore at Dolce Vita. The meu evoked summer in the primi of zucchii blossoms stuffEd with ricotta and an heirloom tomato barratta plate. Felix, the manager,chose a truly loveLynn Nuit St, Georges which worked beautifully wth both my parma-wrapped sea bass and Rich's braised short ribs, both of which were delicious. The service wa attentive without being obsequious, and we had a front row view of the Marana Bay Sands laser ligtsho
5
The restaurant is situated on the pool deck of the hotel. It has both indoor and outdoor tables. We opted for the latter, as it was not excessively humid, and there was a gentle breeze blowing. We both opted for the 3 course set menu; the food was of a uniformly stellar quality, probably as good as Italian restaurant cuisine gets. Our waiter, Paneer, was first class, and his contribution to our enjoyment of the meal was significant. He took a photo of us, which was presented to my wife as we were about to leave, together with a single red rose. As a general note, be aware that restaurants throughout Singapore charge on a "++" basis...typically adding a 10% service charge and 7% for Goods and Services Tax. It can make eating out in the Lion City an expensive affair.
5
Delicious Italian food. The best desert we have ever had. Amazingly friendly and attentive service. We plan to come back many times.
4
Great food, but pricey for a bottle of wine. Location is good by the pool area, views are tremendous.

Some good friends offered me a gift card for any service or restaurant in the Mandarin Oriental. My wife and I decided to visit Dolce Vita with our son (13) and daughter (16). Our reservation was for 6:30 p.m., the hour at which dining begins. However, we arrived early. The manager received us graciously at 5:30 p.m. and we ordered poolside drinks. Our server brought us delicious snacks to accompany our drinks. In the meantime, I enquired about using my eGift card. Both the manager and the server went out of their way by allowing me to forward the card to the restaurant email address so that they could print it, and prepare it for use at the end of the meal. That may seem normal, but I had trouble doing the same thing at a different restaurant in the same hotel. Right from the start, I could tell that the staff was willing to go out of their way to make our visit wonderful. When our table was ready, we were given menus and suggestions. We are always wary of servers "offering" extras just to find out at the time the bill arrives, the "extras" weren't free. When my daughter ordered a starter as a main course and asked that it be served with the other mains, we were surprised when she was offered a small, but elegant and complimentary starter. My wife and I ordered wine by the glass and were surprised by the generous portions and excellent quality in spite of the comparatively low cost when weighed against the price of a bottle. At the very end of the meal, my wife and daughter were offered red roses. Throughout the meal we had 3 different servers and two managers attend to us. All of them made us feel welcome, important and looked after. Normally, I would find this overbearing, however the people taking care of us seemed so sincere and genuinely kind. Most importantly, they were highly trained professionals. It wasn't cheap, but if you appreciate service, you will enjoy Dolce Vita.Lastly... Excellent bread, spreads and olive oil. Excellent fish (Cod and Turbo). Excellent deserts: pineapple carpaccio with lemon custard as well as Tiramisu, as good as I've ever had. Pork collar was ok, but next time..., and there will be a next time..., I'll have the cod.Enjoy
5
Excellent food with charming staffs who really take care of your dining experience from starting to end ! The view is great ,facing MBS and city skyline ! Crab tartare - absolutely stunning and the Cod fish - you will definitely crave for it once you leave the restaurant ! Earl grey mousse - you cannot find it in any other place :) overall it was a great dining experience ...
5
I visited Dolce Vita during Chinese New year with my friends. I enjoyed the ambience and the service of the staffs! i started with mushroom soup (excellent soup!) and for my main Beef tenderloin with potato foam very delicious! the wine selection is really good. great food! great service! great drinks!
5
Enjoyed lunch & dinner at Dolce Vita Restaurant and loved it. The service is good and atmosphere and decor of the restaurant is very nice. The food is top quality and prepared by an authentic italian chef. Enjoyed it and would come back next time we are in Singapore

Reservation was made and everything plan during that night was smooth with little more surprise added.Pre-celebrate my girlfriend birthday. After we arrived we were seated my the Asst Manager Mukesh with the best view in Singapore. Napkins was unfold and carefully put on our lap and beverage order being taken. We arrived slight early around 1840 hrs. Still able to see the city from bright to dark. Rhea the servers still remember what I like and also change of menu since my last visit. That impress me.We ordered a set as well as few ala carte item. Although portion looks small, but our stomach were filled with the surprise of a small cake at the end of our meal and a stalk of roses for my girlfriend.Overall experience that I could find in any other hotel in Singapore. Professional yet delicious food, and also the restaurant that never fail my expectation yet exceed it. Thanks for the chef de cuisine that prepare the food, Mukesh, Vanessa, Kevin & Steven for providing us such a memorable dining experience
3
We were a party of 5 for the set Sunday Brunch. Unique from other brunches in Singapore in that the starters and mains are served and only the desserts are self service. The portions were fairly small, although you can keep reordering any dish, however this can take a while and spoils the flow of the meal. Some dishes were very creative and tasty but some dishes, especially the pasta was very standard. The champagne was served well and was of a good quality. The real let down was at the end where it took 30 minutes for them to process the credit cards. For $185 or so per head, get yourself to The Fullerton, Raffles or Pan Pacific. Much better experience
4
Came her for a birthday dinner with my partner, and we loved it. Although the price may appear to be unnecessarily high, but I'd still give a go sign.They have indoor seating as well as outdoor, but the out door is definitely nicer. Atmosphere is quite and chilled, and if you get a good seat you will be having a 180 degrees view of marina bay. Food is more than just average (Yet wouldn't give a 5 star..?), same wine are way more pricy than other places, yet deserts were delightful.As it was my partner's birthday they prepared her a birthday cake and sang the birthday song :)Staff were lovely and up to standards, was a great dining experience after all
3
We would not return here. The best part was the view of the Ship building. We sat outside at dinner time. The light 'show' was professionally done. The food was just OK. We both had the wild game set menu. I think it was a promotion. Instead of a piece of the animal on two of the dishes we were served some kind of rolled meat almost like a sausage and not at all uplifting or beneficial to the game. This was the case with the Rabbit and Boar. The Venison was an outstanding dish, unfortunately the only one. The wine, a bottle of Torres Celeste was good not great and not something I'd order again . The wine was $90 US and the entire meal including tip and tax was $333.
4
i had dinner at Dolce Vita. The setting was very nice overlooking the pool. The food was good without being stunning. The service was great and the staff was very friendly. Good place overall.
5
We had lunch here once.
Very good food and service.
Great mushroom soup, great spaghetti bolognese, very good corn fed chicken.
Nice view over the pool and over the skyline. Quite expensive.
5
This Italian Restaurant is relax and casual dining with an upmarket vibe.
The Menu has great classic favourite with their own style.
From Vitello Tonarto , to stuffed zucchini flowers. Good wine list great service,
5
So helpful in accommodating my dietary needs and a vegan friend. Beautiful food and great service. Will be back.

Four of us for the Sunday set lunch. As locals we prefer to sit inside to appreciate the Aircon and gaze out across the hotel pool. Wonderful food & service, with some changes to the menu to satisfy us very fussy diners :)Special thanks to Taylor & Steven for looking after us. Plus a huge thank you to Mr Inthran, who despite being the brilliant hotel sommelier, was on duty as the Restaurant Manager for the day and took great pleasure in ensuring that no request from us was too much trouble for him and his team. Thanks guys.

We frequent the outdoor lounge outside this restaurant when in town, as a great place for a drink and view of the light show on the marina at dusk. Our last visit was earlier in the afternoon, and was a splendid weekend date. Great breeze and view, always fantastic lychee martinis, and a well valued wine list. Service is always professional, prompt, and friendly...with good knowledge of the menu and drinks. Whether for a quick drink or leisurely sit, we always find this lounge to btw one of our favorites

My partner and I enjoyed a late dinner at Dolce Vita. The service was very friendly and attentive, and the food was simply divine. I started with the mushroom soup, which was absolutely delicious, although quite rich towards the end. For the main course I opted for the lobster pasta, which was a rather small portion, however equally as delicious as the appetizer. The price of the food is quite high, so be prepared to spend upwards of $400 SGD for a three course meal for two. However, this is expected given the service, quality of food, and location. All in all, this a great restaurant for anyone looking for a tasty Italian experience and great service

We made reservation at 6.30pm and we were early by 15 mins however we were not allowed to enter the restaurant. Would be good if they would have allowed us to take a seat inside the restaurant to wait.Overall we are pleased with one of the staff service and her name is Rhea

Our first visit to the restaurant and we were not disappointed at all. Service is excellent , attentive and warm. This is the only restaurant I have encountered which asks if you have any food allergies - and if you do , the staff will recommend suitable dishes. The maître de explained the menu options with enthusiasm and a dash of humour. We choose the set dinner options which offer good value - the ala carte menu can be pricey. The set menu portions are slightly smaller than ala carte but filling nonetheless- at least they were for us !The food overall was excellent ! For starters , we had the avocado crab meat mousse and veal eye round -simple yet full of flavor and quiet refreshing. We tried the linguine with Maine lobster- tomato based but a good mix of the sauce and lobster flesh. The angus beef was well prepared, succulent and very tasty- just the way I like it!For dessert we tried the chocolate mousse with raspberry - good blend of sweet , bitter and tangy ! The tiramisu is different - light like a soufflé with a heavier emphasis on the coffee! Service thought out dinner was friendly, diligent , attentive and personal. A very good restaurant for special occasions or if you just crave great Italian cuisine

This is one of those gems you wish you'd stumble onto more often. My wife and I are vegetarians, but this did not seem to be an issue as the menu has options and the staff was willing to prepare special dishes off-the-menu for us. There was a surprise antipasti sampler that was delicious.They also organised a surprise cake for my wife who's birthday we were celebrating. Excellent place
5
I ordered food from the pool, and the menu was the same, i was blown away to see the lovely touch of bringing the pizza in a Mandarin Oriental box is amazing !
5
I have had many good meals in my life, a few excellent meals but todays meal excelled them all. The food was interesting diverse presented wonderfully and was an overall culinary pleasure to be remembered
5
Calm ambiance overlooking the pool at the Oriental with excellence service and good Italian cooking for business and social occasions. Consistently high quality
5
My first visit on my birthday with my hubby. Loved the scenery there even thought it is only on the 4th floor. The food was good but rather pricey. And the staff was friendly and thoughtful. They also sung a birthday song when they dished out a lovely birthday cake and a rose. I've enjoyed the night. Thanks for everything
5
I've reviewed a number of restaurants with 5-Stars, and I regret that I can't give Dolce Vita 6 or 7 stars. This was an incredible meal from beginning to end. I enjoyed lunch poolside, and the views of the pool as well as the Singapore skyline are incredible. I was served an amuse bouche of seared tuna with marshmallow, and it was a pleasant surprise. I started with the citrus mesclun salad, which was perfectly balanced with straciatella cheese and citrus. The main course was a roselline pasta with tallegio, goat cheese, and walnuts. This was one of the best lunches that I can remember
3
We had our "anniversary" dinner here on Friday night, we were professionally welcomed an guided to the table. We ordered Burrata and Canneloni Crab for starters and that was superb. For mains we had Seabass and Maine Lobster. Both tasted good and were well presented, however the lobster was the size of a big prawn. Unbelievable that they call this a "whole lobster", as "whole baby lobster" would be a more appropriate description. And the price for the little creature was SGD 78++. For dessert we had some orange & grapefruit sorbet which was refreshing. All in all a fine meal but overpriced and micro portions.
5
This is my second dining experience at Dolce Vita the first was dinner earlier this year and this time we tried the lunch. Again the food was amazing and the service attentive but not over the top. Even though we were there for lunch which I think only goes from 12-3pm we never felt rushed the staff were happy for us to sit for as long as we wanted to and enjoy our meal. Will be back next year for my fathers birthday.
5
Im not sure what I was really expecting, but we were quite surprise by the amazing view. The flyer, the marina bay, and last, but not least the light show at 9:30; and the pool has a relaxing and romantic feeling.Our pasta plates were some of the best we have tried in Italy or the States. And because it was kind of late sunday 8:30 pm, we had the restaurant almost to ourselves. The service was the best, attentive but not oppressive. Be sure to ask for a table outsideOnly observation. It's not cheap at all, be ready for a nice check. But it is so worthy.I will be back anyda

Dropped in on a Friday night on the basis of the high TripAdvisor ranking. First impressions were somewhat mixed. The space is lovely and nicely-lit, with a relaxing ambiance and a view of the hotel pool, but for a Friday night the place was very quiet indeed (I estimate the restaurant was about 1/3 full).First, the plus points. The service was excellent from start to finish. Friendly, observant, and efficient, and definitely not impolite as claimed by a reviewer below. The bartender knows how to mix a good Martini, and the prices are not too bad for a hotel restaurant in Singapore. And, despite the lack of buzz, this is a pleasant environment to while away a Friday evening.Given the above, it's a shame that the food can't match the level of service. Since the reviews on this site suggest many diners apparently enjoyed the food here, I'm wondering whether I may have received something of a lower standard because I ordered the cheaper set menu ($88++ for antipasti, pasta, and dessert), but even if that is the case, it's disappointing for a restaurant pitching itself at this level. The Burrata Pugliese was small in size and rubbery in texture, while the fusilli with duck ragout was passable without being spectacular.I wish I'd enjoyed this meal more since their service really is excellent, but I think it needs to be pointed out that--on the basis of my experience--this is nowhere near being one of Singapore's ten best restaurants. Singapore is full of Italian eateries, many of which offer better food than Dolce Vita

We could not face another Singapore meal served with a brown gelatinous sauce. Trip Advisor informed us that there was an excellent Italian restaurant in town.  We were happy to find that Dolce Vita exceeded our expectations. It was a trifle difficult to access from our hotel, the Pan Pacific, through an underground parking garage but we were greatly rewarded. The staff at Dolce Vita were helpful and very welcoming. The food was delightfully fresh and exquisitely presented. It was our very best meal in Singapore. We are vegetarians and they made every effort to provide us with a delightful meal. Our friends were meat-eaters and loved their chicken and fish meals. The bill was not exorbitant, and we were happy campers
3
Was there for lunch. Great view of the pool and marina bay sand. Service is ok but I'm expecting a better service. Food presentation is good. And taste is ok. Not so bad. Set lunch menu, consisting of 3 course meal. Costs at about SGD65++.
4
This was the second time I went there. Both were amazing experiences!
The decoration, the music, the friendly service and most of all the surprising containers they use to serve the different, imaginative and tasty drinks. Definitely worthwhile the visit!
4
A good place to have lunch or dinner and the enjoy the beautiful view of Singapore harbor. The appetizers are very tasty and a bit surprising, in a good way and the entrees are flavors rich with a strong Italian identity. It's authentic and honest ! The wine selection is also great, and offers a selection of wines from Italy, to Australia.Service is excellent with a very kind staff
4
DV is a beautiful place with a fantastic staff. My dinner partner requested to speak with the chef; Omar came out and entertained every question we had and managed to put together a dish just for me because I had been craving lobster ravioli (that's an awful run-on sentence!!). The city view from the restaurant is lovely. Although, it did seem strange to me to have a nice restaurant next to a pool where guests are still swimming. But it worked
4
This award winning spot won me over immediately with its beautiful and elegant atmosphere. It was a particularly nice evening so we chose to dine al fresco. Chef Marco is a maestro in the kitchen. His dishes tasted inspired and confident. Service was very discrete and professional. Probably the best Italian restaurant in Singapore
5
Brought my gf here for her birthday dinner on a sat night and service was top notch! Food was excellent! The waitress attached to us even gave her a pleasant surprise, sang her a birthday song and was presented with a very nice complimentary birthday cake and rose. Great views all around
1
Im not sure if this is a tenant or runs by the Hotel. Very surprised quality of poor service. Im not looking for a magic or even a smile but they are not polite. Slow service. Surprisingly poor selection of wine. No much choice in menu and its below average execution. Im sorry for them. With such nice setting, they can do better. At the end, restaurant is not rated by the hardware but food and software. They have a huge potential to lift themselves up to higher reputation is they improve on food and service
5
We reserved a couple of hours beforehand, and manged to get a table on the terrace.One of my best dining experience ever on holiday: outstanding view, very thoughtful personnel, incredible food and heavenly wine.We were spoilt with little surprises such as amuses-bouches and complimentary desserts from the moment we stepped out on the breathtaking terrace until we went home. If you are looking for a romantic diner in an exquisite setting, this is it!

As a mandarin oriental fan we popped in for lunch on our last day in Singapore. We came across the dolce vita poolside drink and snacks bar, which was by the glorious swimming pool. We had just visited the marina bay hotel which was nice but the mandarin was much more classy. I don't normally review places that we just pop in for lunch, but I wanted to as the service here was incredible! We were given complimentary water, crisps and nuts while we had a short wait on our drinks. I ordered the chef salad and it came with with yummy warm olive breads and a mix of amazing spreads - olive cream etc. they also brought my husband out a plate in case he happened to want any (he hadn't ordered anything).I won't go on and on, but all the extra bits and the amazing service made the lunch good value ... Would highly recommend a visit if you are in Singapore
4
the approach to the restaurant doesn't inspire confidence as the placement of the restaurant is such that it looks like an after thought - however, once you're inside, it does feel cosy and the staff do try their best to make you as comfortable as possible - but I have to say that the restaurant doesn't look like one of the MO group's best effortsThe set dinner menus are very generously portioned, and the assorted complimentary dips are dangerously addictiveThe quality of the cooking is goodall in all, a very pleasant experience, and surprisingly good value for the M

Dolce Vita offers a limited, but nice selection of Italian inspired dishes and an acceptable wine list to go with the food.
It is nice to have dinner and a good glass of wine by the pool after a long meeting day.
5
The place is perfectly situated with a view to Marina Bay Sands and the food was just great! On my next Singapore visit I will definitely go their again.
5
Says it all in the title really. View is stunning from outdoor table. Food is delicious with little extra touches from the chef. Our waiter was really friendly and thoughtful. Highly recommend.
5
The staff were nice and helped me after an accident. The food was fabulous and the chef took time to come and have a chat with the customers.
3
It is ok, but not more. The view is nice and the service a bit above average. However if you consider the prices for what you get, then it is too expensive, even for a hotel restaurant.
5
We ended up at Dolce Vita by accident (sorry!) when staying at the Mandarin - the restaurant we were intending to go to had closed and we ended up heading back to the hotel late, tired and hot after a trip to the Night Safari. We could not have been made more welcome. I had forgotten my reading glasses and was offered a magnifier so I could read the menu and avoid going back to my room. Now that's service...Great food, really excellent pasta dishes and the desserts we chose were beautifully executed and lovely to look at. Thanks for saving our evening
5
From the Restaurant s terrace You have an amazing view on singapore Center, Marina bay Sands and all the nice places singapore can offer.You have a fantastic Metal in the Restaurant and than a drink with the view mentioned above.But the big asset is Paneer a very well trained waiter. He is as polite as he is an expert on drinks. He knows erverything about all the great wines they offer there.Paneer alone makes it worth to visit this special place

Visited on one of the weekends for the rehearsal of national day parade with live fireworks. Upon arrival we were greeted by the staff and was direct to our designated seats. We request for an outdoor seating, the view was stunning I can say is the best view in Singapore with Singapore landmark. Once seated drinks was being offered. After 10 mins we decide for our meal. Ciabatta with the tomato paste was excellent. We just fill half of our stomach with the bread and condiments. Starter was served service was top notch. Taste of the soup seems change compare to previous. Beef carpaccio slight disappointing beef was too thick is like 1/2 cm thick, still prefer the previous beef carpaccio as thin as paper that serve in dolce vita. But the presentation was really good. Special thanks to Rhea, Jen and Laura who taking care of is during the dinner. Was treated like a king although the restaurant was quite busy.
5
Went to Dolce Vita for dinner last July 10 with colleagues and we were so impressed! We were seated at the perfect spot where the skyline set as a magnificent backdrop to a lovely dinner. Vanessa, our server, was so cheerful and friendly, and gave us complimentary drinks and chocolates! Plus, we got to meet the chef who was so nice, he gave us a couple of surprise treats as well! We couldnt have asked for a better dinner to cap off a rather exhausting day
5
Just had an experience of a lifetime when I had my first visit here in Singapore last month where in I dine at this restaurant and being serve by one of your wait staff namely Vanessa... She was a superb in giving service and a fabulous to be with.. I highly recommend her on making my stay worthwhile! Congrats for having an asset on your company,, hopefully to see vanessa and the rest of the team again when I get back
5
Loved eating here, hard to think it's in the middle of Singapore....enjoyed superb seafood pasta. Excellent staff and service. Sit outside if you can.
5
Service never fail here. Staff is friendly and gives good recommendation on the food. The food never fail to please and with a nice view of the pool. It will be cooling at night if you are seated outdoors.

We chose the Dolce Vita to have a romantic dinner and treat ourselves. We were very happy with the result ! We had dinner on the terrace - the view is very nice with the MBS, and the lights from the swimming pool. The indoor part looks very cosy as well. Service was great, and we decided to go for a 3 course menu. Food was very good but not exceptional. The wine was high standard ! We had 3 course dinner*2, 2 glasses of Champagne, 1 glass of wine, 2 bottle of water, for about $370 all included. At the end, the bill is quiet high but it worth the scenary dinner, so romantic ! Perfect night and perfect atmosphere !I would just add one thing; I would advice the Management not to allow children in the pool at dinner time - we had children playing in the pool, there were quiet noisy. Luckily they did not stay for a long timeâ€¦ but it could have ruined our romantic dinner

Many years ago, I was invited by a Room Sales Executive for a 'tour' of the Mandarin Oriental. It was then I was first 'introduced' to Dolce Vita, a fine dining Italian restaurant by the poolside. I was so impressed with the setting and the view across the fondly remembered 'Esplanade' that I set my heart on dining here one day. So finally my husband and I were invited to dinner with the option of choosing my 'dream' restaurant. We were a group of 8 and were allocated a long table right at the front. Service was pleasant enough but not particularly outstanding. The service staff seemed to be busy shuttling about with guests seated outside by the pool. We were served an amuse bouche which was a 'miss' so most of us left it unfinished. For starters, I had Cream of Pumpkin Soup ($16). They served the cubes of pumpkin in a soup dish and then poured the soup out from a pot. My husband had the Tortellini ai Pomodori secchi e pecorino which is hand crafted tortellini stuffed with semi-dried tomatoes, pecorion and pine nuts, served with basil pesto ($30). This he commented was good. For main course I had the Medaglione di vitello al prosciutto - Prosciutto wrapped medallion of milk-fed veal tenderloin with potato puree, asparagus, fricassee of morel and Madeira sauce ($52). The meat was very tender and a joy to eat. My husband opted for the Branzino scottato - Pan fried seabass with thyme scented spring vegetables, cauliflower puree and Champagne foam which he enjoyed thoroughly. Two of our friends had pistachio crusted lamb which they said was very good. However, another who selected the steak was left rather disappointed as it was overdone and not as tender as it should have been. For dessert we shared a sort og mango tart with coconut ice cream and pineapple puree and it was 'buonissimo'. Overall it was a lovely evening out although the prices are steep here. With Bay@5 a stone's throw away, it is a beautiful place to enjoy the night view before or after dinner. We stood out at the open space admiring the clear, star-studded night, caressed by wafts of cool breezes. Veramente la dolce vita

Before i describe anything i would like to tell you that this restaurant has defined fine dining for me and the standards they set with their hospitality i doubt any restaurant can beat.My husband took me here as a surprise for my birthday. To begin with my husband dropped them a mail and their response was prompt and they also mentioned to him that they would arrange a complimentary cake for me. When we arrived at the restaurant, they had reserved 2 tables (one inside and one outside) since the weather was unpredictable which was very thoughtful. We chose to sit outside by the pool. Unlike most of the restaurants/clubs by the pool, this one was very quiet and romantic. We could hear the water trickling in the pool and the view of marina bay sands was great. The lighting was just perfect. The best part of this restaurant was its service. The person serving us was Rhea and she made our evening ! The drink and food suggestions were perfect.She even told us we could choose half portions of main course and try different dishes. She made sure we were very well taken care of. She gave us our space at the same time even cared to converse with my husband while i was off to the restroom. She made us feel like we were royalty.The food was very nice . Presentation and flavors were great. We were also given complimentary cold soup and chabata bread with dips. The drinks were also perfect and worth every penny. Now comes the best part. After dinner Rhea gave us a complimentary Singapore sling . Then when we were waiting for the bill three of them came with a cake singing happy birthday , and made my husband give me a rose . They stood there till i made a wish, blew the candle and cut the cake. This was really wonderful. We were really full by the time we had the cake and then came 2 chocolates too!!! this restaurant gives more than you can expect. It was a great birthday for me and my husband was very glad about booking this .The price is definitely worth it and for the first time in Singapore we felt the need to tip someon
5
Outdoor tables have a romantic atmosphere. The restaurant is for couples not business meetings.Good Italian food, beautifully presented. Portions are fine. The supporting bits such a bread, amuse bouche etc are well done.Service is charming, efficient but not "over the top".Prices are fair for this quality and location.Wine selection is tremendous, but quite highly priced.Would I come back? Yes. Definitely

I called to make a reservation a few days before my actual dinner as I intend to surprise my wife by bringing her here for a romantic dinner during our 6th wedding anniversary. We held our wedding reception here at the grand ballroom 6 years ago and I was sure that my wife would love to come back for a dinner.They had renovated the swimming pool area since (the dolce vita is located beside the pool) and the ambience looked promising when we first arrived. We were warmly welcomed by Vanessa and was brought to our table immediately. She went on to say that she's expecting us and looked very excited. We were surprised to see that they had decorated out table with rose petals; a great personal touch indeed. We were seated right beside the pool and had a wonderful view overlooking the reservoir and marina bay sands. While we were ordering, Vanessa made a couple of recommendations and of course, we heeded her advise and we never regretted. Service throughout the dinner was outstanding, not only Vanessa but the other servers as well. I noticed that every plates and bowls served were hot (as the servers were using a napkin to serve them unto our table). By doing this, they ensure that every dishes served were hot since all the food are served on warm plates. I noticed that Vanessa will always asked us if we were ready to be served our next dish and we would wait for another 10-15 minutes. I believed that the chefs only cook our dishes only when we were ready! The servers were really attentive to our needs and introduced every dishes that were served unto our tables. We truly appreciate that as we would really be interested to know what's on and in the dish as these days with fine dining, it can get pretty difficult for us to know what we are eating just by looking at it.At the end of the dinner, after about 3 hours, we ordered coffee and requested to be switched to the lounge area and our request was immediately entertained by Vanessa who was always so helpful during the entire dinner.We left the place very very satisfied and impressed with their service standards and food! And yes, there were some very personal touches by the restaurant at the end of the dinner. They gave us a complimentary cake and the receipt was place inside an envelope with personal handwriting on the outside of the envelope! After so many experiences of fine dining both here in Singapore and overseas, honestly this was the first time we ever received our receipts in an envelope with personal handwriting on it. Vanessa even recommended me to use credit cards by certain banks to enjoy a 15% discount on the bill! Great job Vanessa and we left the place feeling so pampered.I would recommend this restaurant to anyone anytime. Be it the food or the service, it's seriously top-notch. Keep up the good work Vanessa and dolce vita. And yes, in the middle of of dinner, the restaurant manager did walk up to our table to check if everything was fine; another great service gesture!Thank you Vanessa for making our special day more special and exclusive and thank you mandarin oriental for the great service and food

Had a wonderful evening last week for a birthday celebration. The service from the minute we stepped in the restaurant was very impressive. We ordered the Blue Lobster Bisque to share (for two) and the portion was quite generous, Tuscan Cacciucco (seafood platter) and Angus Beef Tenderloin for main course and finished with our course with the classic Italian Tiramisu. The soup was light and aromatic with a big scallop at the bottom, one of the best lobster bique I ever had. The seafood platter was very delicious with Maine lobster, king crab, Hokkaido scallop, tiger prawn and cod in seafood and shell fish soup, The Angus beef tenderloin was so succulent and juicy that it melts in the mouth, absolutely one of the best ever. The dessert was a good finale to our 3- courses ala carte dinner. Will definitely be back to try their other tempting dishes in the menu
5
We celebrated our Silver Wedding Anniversary here in April. Upon arrival we were shown to our table outside over looking the pool, and the Singapore skyline, it was perfect. All of the staff made us feel very welcome, they were very attentive and could not have done anymore. We had mentioned on booking, that it was our Silver Wedding Anniversary, and our table was decorated beautifully. Our meal was faultless from beginning to end, and we would not hesitate in recommending this restaurant. Although it is not cheap, we found that for a perfect and memorable evening we were certainly not disappointed
4
With new design around swimming pool area, making Dolce Vita become a good ambiance to dine for two or group dining, however, some areas need to improve such as Wine List per glasses, quantity on pouring wine ordering by glass, quantity of food with providing complimentary car park coupon as benefit. Lobster Bisque was our main reason we were there
4
Great food and amazing views. The staff were awesome. Food was great value, we both enjoyed the pastas, however the only downside was the pricey wine list, way over standard prices for good to average Australian wines.
5
Wherever I go in the world I make a point to try and dine at the Mandarin Oriental because I am never disappointed. The franchise maintains a high quality of service and product and the Dolce Vita is no exception.
4
Very nice food, service just a tad slow. Great view!!! The young lady pouring my wine recited all the characteristics of the wine as by rote which was amusing.
3
Service a tad slow, and they tried to fob off mozzarella cheese as burrata. They did take the cost of that dish off the bill.
Osobuco was very salty.
Nice view of the skyline though.
5
My partner and I make sure we visit Dolce Vita every time we go to Singapore. It is absolutely stunning. Not only is the service flawless but the food and wine selection is incredible and the atmosphere is perfect for a romantic evening.Be sure to finish your drinks outside on the lounge - such a beautiful end to a perfect experience. We will definitely be back
5
This is a very lovely place for dining. The staffs were amazing and tentative. The food was wonderful and how I wished I have the 2nd and 3rd compartment in my digestion hence I could re-order and eat everything. The food presentation was lovely. A great b'day brunch and will definitely go back to Dolce Vita for great meal. True gem of Italian Restaurant at Mandarin Oriental Singapore
5
The Décor itself is just lovely, and lends itself to the start of a lovely lunch or dinner. The pasta was divine! Cooked to perfection and with a lovely entrée of warm breads and dips.Service was impeccable.We had a table by the window so we could view the amazing light show over at the Marina Bay Gardens.As we left the hostess presented us with red rose. Just a lovely evening and certainly a place to visit if staying at the Hotel
5
Enjoyed a wonderful dinner and the 5 star experience started before we even arrived.Went to see the staff the day before as had originally booked for a table outsided however after watching kids jumping around all day in the pool, we weren't sure we wanted that view whilst having dinner, plus the weather was quite warm so the air con inside was appealing. The manager went over and above and said he will keep both a table inside and out for us and when we arrive for our reservation we could then decide where we wanted to sit.Food and service was fantastic. Must try the lobster bisque with scallops !
5
Farewell brunch with a group of 6. I love the atmosphere lots of natural light nice and airy, very attentive but not overbearing service. The staff do an excellent job of sensing the vibe of the table and are always close by when you need them. True test of a champagne brunch to pass is whether they can avoid a dry glass on the table, certainly that test was passed with flying colors. Eiw did a great job keeping the glasses topped up so no idea how much we consumed. I have been a repeat customer for a few years now and it's great to see some changes to the menu. The old favorites, including the Piedmont truffle risotto remain and that continues to be truly excellent but there are some nice new additions, the Parma ham with a mozzarella espuma was especially good. I have now tried all champagne brunch venues I am aware of but keep coming back here. I love the concept of lots of little dishes being brought to the table which means you actually get to spend time talking to your co-diners rather than getting up and down repeatedly and refilling you plate. Jan and team do an excellent job really looking after their customers and the champagne, Ruinart is IMHO the best free flow champagne in Singapore. Look forward to returning again soon
3
Located by the pool and designed like a beach side cabana with a sea view makes this an ideal venue for a casual dinner with friends or partners. The service is professional but overly formal and when placed in the setting, feels mismatched. As with any Oriental hotels the team is well trained and warm, so tuning down on the formal tones would improve the experience lots. The food was well presented but not something to go there for, given the vast number of great Italian restaurants in Singapore.
4
Great place to chill out for a nice romantic poolside yet classy and city views galore as it is rooftop at the mandarian oriental. You must check it out, especially if you enjoy contemporary italian cuisine.
4
This is the ideal spot to sip sundowners and look at the city life go by. On the roof of the a Mandarin Oriental, this restaurant serves great cocktails and awesome Italian food! Views of the city are truly stunning.
5
We came here for lunch and dinner and were happy with all services here at this restaurant. Food and drinks were fantastic although they were expensive. Worth value for money after all.
5
The food is very good and the service even better. The restaurant is quite large and there are quiet corners should you want to discuss business. Like most Singapore establishments, the air conditioning is kept going at full blast so remember to bring a jacket or a shawl!Can't wait to dine again at the Dolce Vita 
5
We visited this restaurant only because we are staying at Mandarin Oriental and we really like it. Very pleasant setting, amazing view and a cocktails on the terrace before dinner were quite nice. The dinner itself was very good, both presentation and taste was very to my liking. Service was ok. I shared my feedback with some local friends but surprisingly they didn't know about Dolce Vita. but based on my experience this place deserves to be recommended
4
If I had not been kindly invited to join lunch at Dolce Vita at the Mandarin Oriental Singapore I would no doubt have never found it! Hidden almost away on the 5th floor by the stunning pool setting at the Mandarin Oriental I was really impressed with service and the tasty food. Clearly a restaurant known in the business circles, the tables were full of diners in suits looking as sharp as the service. The decor is lovely with summer style design of light yellow and cream colors beautifully interwoven into the overall dining area. The menu is sleek with wines to match. We shared a few very nice starters, including the excellent mushroom soup and a lovely tomato and Mozzarella salad and then the Risotto Milanese with a fine espresso to finish off....I was keen to try out the Tiramisu, but new I would be rolling out if I did.......I will for sure return, but might bring my wife as by night the restaurant would look very romantic, maybe even check-in for the weekend so the kinds can play around the pool
5
Great atmosphere and location overlooking the Marina Bay and the Service impeccable. Cuisine fantastic, try the Shrimps and Seafood starters and the Sirloin Steak as a main course was superb. The accompanied selection of wines were excellent and deserts fantastic. The German Manager really knows how to provide a great service and the Young Indian Chef can certainly prepare a wonderful mea
5
At the price it needed to be something special and it was! Came here for Valentines night after a long flight. Although it was a set menu for the occasion that wasn't a problem the food was gorgeous, the service excellent and the location which was outside, close to pool and overlooking Marina Bay was just fantastic. A night to remember! Certainly a restaurant for a special occasion
5
Just took my girlfriend for a delayed valentine dinner and we were no disappointed. The reservation was confirmed quickly for a dinner on the same day. Our waitress Vanessa was outstanding and gave us good tips. The food is very delicious, fine dining italian. I would recommend an outdoor table. Some tables have a very good view on to the skyline of Singapore
5
This restaurant is definitely not cheap - but - there are some good options for a set menu, paired with wines. However, once you start going thro the menu it is difficult not to go for exactly what your taste buds want. In my case Scallops on a champagne foam, Lobster pasta followed by milk fed Veal ( which is the best veal I have ever tasted ). This should have been enough but the temptation of Apple puff pastry with Calvados ice cream was hard to resist. We had a lovely table outside - but with a covered terrace. One slight negative could be the fact that the restaurant is adjacent to the outside pool and a family came out fairly late for a swim. This did NOT put us off but I would expect the Management to keep an eye on this

The food is nothing special. I ordered the Pasta Trio (Chef's choice). The meal was not when served and rather bland. My better half made the same comment about his meal.

Made a reservation online for restaurant today 1st of February 2014 with confirmation to celebrate my daughter's birthday.Was called as we were getting ready by a staff member that they were unable to honor our reservation.Offered a later time of 9pm instead of 6.30pm which of course is not suitable.Suggest they buck-up and improve their online services & booking system.Luckily managed to call Capricci.. A far better restaurant and confirm our reservation instantly with efficiency and professionalism.Disgusted

A delicious meal which was beyond our expectations. We arrived at restaurant without a reservation so the hostess was unable to give us an outside table as all reserved, however the ambience inside is lovely & we were offered a window table. The air conditioning was blasting out & when the hostess saw that I was feeling uncomfortable she immediately offered to adjust the a/c so within a minute the temperature was perfect.We both chose the 3 course menu which also includes tea/coffee (& amuse bouche). It was a great choice - all courses cooked to perfection & presented beautifully. The tastes were exquisite & as good as we find in any top London restaurant. Would definitely recommend this restaurant & return here again. The food, service & ambience all 5

We stayed at the Mandarin for 4 nights in March 2013, and had dinner one evening to celebrate my mum's 60th birthday (as a group of six). The meal was simply outstanding. Whilst it's very expensive, the quality of food matched the prices and everyone had great meals. The wine selection was good but unsurprisingly expensive (like most Asian cities). We also enjoyed lunch from Dolce Vita on their terrace next to the pool during our stay, and again this was fantastic. Such great memories eating some pasta and pizza whilst sipping wine next to the pool, looking out over the marina and the Marina Bay Sands opposite

Being seated on the terrace, next to the pool, with the CBD right in front of us, the first nice thing about Dolce Vita is the place in itself. Then comes the service, very professional, efficient and smiling. And finally the food, not exceptional but very good, and coming at a reasonable price. A place I definitely recommend

Booked a table for our honeymoon and the email confirmation promised to make it romantic, but wow the service we've just had was simply stunning!!! Jan & Vanessa were phenomenal, attentive but not intrusive, giving advise and guidance on the menu and their recommendations were spot on. The food and wines were divine, the location heavenly and the service and thoughtless of the aforementioned staff made it a truly memorable night and one that we will always treasure. Thank you. x

Beautiful views of the marina and a delightful afternoon tea. We arrived just on five pm just on when afternoon tea is no longer served, however the staff very easily and politely accommodated our request. I'm glad they did as it was a lovely selection of sweet and savoury, hot and cold treats

In Saturday night, finding the romantic place for me and my couple might be a little bit hard. Why? It is because some cafÃ© or restaurant might be too crowded and they do not serve Champagne Brunch. When I was looking for a restaurant with Champagne Brunch, a guy told me that Dolce Vita at Mandarin Oriental Singapore will be the one for me. It was on Saturday night. I ordered Roasted Iberico pork and some dessert to the waiter who was very attentive to us. Unfortunately, I forgot to ask his name. The food was outstanding and the dessert was very smooth to the tongue. The service was awesome and the ambiance provided was too perfect

A friend had booked this for our Christmas Day meal. I was unaware beforehand that this would not be the traditional buffet-style of brunch. We were seated outside, and as there are gaps between the awnings we asked whether it would be possible to have an additional parasol to keep the sun off of some of our guests (plus the food / drink). However despite the table next to us being provided with one we were told no more were available - though we could see unused ones over by the pool guests. The brunch lasted from 12:00 - 15:00, yet it was 12:15 before we had any champagne and nearly 12:30 by the time the first starters arrived. The whole platter concept really is a nonsense and in food terms you do not get value-for-money (if only we had booked the same-priced (SGD$280) buffet brunch at the traditionally excelled Melt). The platter concept means you only graze at the food, as opposed to having how much you want, of what you want, when you want it - I don't mind having to queue up to have this! The quality and the taste of the food was fine (nothing stellar). To give them their due they were not shy about keeping the champagne topped-up, but the red wine, beer and aperol cocktails were all poor. To compound matters whilst they had recognised that we had a vegetarian (no meat, nor fish) at our table they completely failed to inform her that her specific dishes would come out last - ergo she ended up eating bread rolls. Upon informing the manager that she was no longer hungry for the provided vegetarian meal (penne arrabiata - hardly time consuming!) he meekly asked if there was anything else he could provide and hoped she had left room for dessert... There was no point - the dessert selection (buffet-style) was frankly laughable, and there was no cheese at all. I went in search of the manager but he was nowhere to be seen. To top it all off one of our group spoke to a manager who said he would arrange some cheese for us and was very proud of himself when it arrived. To be fair it was decent; what wasn't was the bill that arrived for said cheese platter at an additional $200. Ridiculous. The Mandarin Oriental should be embarrassed. At least I now know where the worst brunch in Singapore is. AVOID

We had Christmas " brunch " here starting at 12.00 and finishing at 3.00 ( I call that lunch ). We had 7-8 entrees and the same number of mains ending in turkey and then followed by a dessert buffet. Each course was small and exquisitely tasty and served to each table on a platter to share. The best is that it is not an all in buffet like most hotel Christmas lunches where people are always jumping up and down and you end up with a plate of mismatched food. Champagne and beer, wine etc was included. The restaurant is not large and is like a large sunroom next to the roof pool. Very relaxed but great service and style. They did mess up our table request which we sorted out without their help. Also, a small complaint that there was no plum pudding or mince pies
3
Unable to handle customers appropriately. The staff needs to learn how to resolve disputes effectively.
5
Jan and team do a truly great job. Attentive and very personal service, food quality excellent every time. Really struggle to find any issues with Dolce Vita - have been so many time now that I would like to see some changes to the menu but in spite of that it won't stop me keep going back for the same great menu. Piedmont truffle risotto is wonderful. No question this is the best weekend brunch in Singapore and I think I have pretty much tried them all now. Thanks always team

My wife and I had the Christmas Day Champagne Lunch here, although the service was excellent and the staff attentive there are a few downers on their "style" of Champagne Brunch (not just Christmas but every Sunday). As this is not a buffet style you are presented with small portions of a wide range of entrées and mains. The problem is that a lot of the selection you maybe can't eat or prefer more of a particular one, this isn't an option. For example my wife loves oysters, she was served just one and although she didn't care for the flan, beef tartar, pasta or cold meats she was left with just a single oyster and a nibble at the rest. She would have preferred half a dozen oysters and nothing more.The second problem is you feel rushed, the entrées and mains all come in quick succession, another arrives before you have finished the previous one. With mains especially the food is barely warm by the time you get to it (the a/c inside is quite cool and food cools quickly).Dessert is a buffet and the selection is good but, although we were advised on arrival a full range of cheeses would be available, non were.. This was a major over-sight as we did pace ourselves expecting some cheeses at the end of the meal. When we queried this they just said "no cheeses are available today".I think there are many much better champagne brunches in Singapore, Dolce Vita do let themselves down by not allowing the customers a more free selection and rather force a little bit of everything on everyone. This would seem to be a decision by them to better manage the food quantities and minimise their waste to increase the profit - clever scheme but not really what your customers expect I would think

Very good Champagne Brunch's in Singapore and one of the only places to do it on a Saturday. Service is great with the free flow champagne, never had an empty glass. Ala Carte makes a nice change to stand up buffet, get to try everything your normally wouldn't and a nice pace. Good quality food, very tasty! Desert is a bit limited

I was searching for a good restaurant to bring my business associate to and used trip adviser. Dolce Vita caught my eye and i decided to give it a try. The staff were very well trained and it was a pleasure to have dined there and the staff were attentive and very professional, making eye contacts and addressing me by name(as I booked the table under my name). My business associates wore suits and they brought in rack hangers next to the table for them to hang their coats without being asked. A nice touch of class I thought.I tried the "Braciole di Iberico" which was the Roasted Iberico pork chop with parsnip purée. it was amazing, it was perfectly done, Juicy and succulent... in fact best Pork Chop I had ever tried. My back was to the windows and for me the view was not the best but for the food and service, I would likely go back again. Not cheap but the price matched the quality of food and service IMHO
5
After reading the reviews on Trip Advisor I and my husband decided to go to Dolce Vita at the Mandarin Oriental. It was a lovely restaurant with tables outside by the pool and an amazing view of the bay. We had a wedding anniversary here. It was to say the one of the best dining experiences I've had in Singapore.I enjoyed several pasta dishes and perhaps the best pork chop (Iberico pork from Spain, served with parsnip foam, olives and fennel) that I have ever had. Food was delicious, wine list was extensive and the overall environment of the restaurant was fantastic. From end to end, I am exceptionally pleased with Dolce Vita and give it my highest accolade & recommendation
5
I am writing this review about 30 minutes before heading to Dolce Vita for champagne brunch for the 6th or 7th time since moving to Singapore. Needless to say, I have been looking forward to today since I decided to go several weeks back.It is always a pleasure visiting Jan and the Dolce Vita team, the chef does an amazing job (the wagyu and truffle risotto are two of my favorites), and the service is always excellent. There is no better way, in my experience, to spend a Saturday or Sunday afternoon, than relaxing near the pool with a never-ending supply of champagne in hand, and being catered to as delicious dish after delicious dish is brought to you at your table. The staff is always friendly and attentive, and Jan makes a good host.My friends and I do miss May, but the new staff are doing their best to match her legendary service; and for that, and the always great selection, camaraderie, and ambience, I give them 5 stars

Nice Italian restaurant at the pool on the terrace of the 5th floor of the Mandarin oriental. Together with Bar@5 and the swimming pool are worth an afternoon plus dinner. We had a wonderful dinner there. The house is nice both outside and inside.Food is delicious and Italian ... Scenic view is great
4
We had a great dinner here, the food was delicious and the atmosphere was fantastic. The staff were extremely helpful. Gave us a lot of options and put together some very good Italian food.The restaurant is on the fifth floor overlooking the swimming pool and in the not too distant horizon, The Marina Bay Sands. Everything is amazing, but price is quite high
5
Ate here last night the service was attentive the staff very friendly and the food was magnificent. The Chefs recommendations are great. A bit on the pricey side but we thought it was worth it.
5
This is a world class establishment from every vantage point. Beautiful setting by the pool at the Mandarin Oriental. Excellent menu, great food, and outstanding personalized service.
5
We had a wonderful dinner here. The first impression was the fantasic view of Singapore. Dolce Vita was decorated beautifully. Food was so delicious and fresh, especially the tiramisu, it was extremely tasty. The waiter were friendly and hopsitable, that make us feel welcomed. And the price was not expesive because the meal was value for money. I really recommend about this place if you want a Wonderful dinner at Singapore
5
My boyfriend and I have a wonderful dinner in there. Everything is good. This is the first restaurant that we came, so They gave our a lot of good impression. Firstly, The good was extremely delicious, I love the Singapore food taste. The space was large and was decorated elegant. We easy to find the nice view. and the services were good. they were very helpful and friendly. the price is not cheap. However, I think it's worthy for good dinner
5
I have dined here twice for lunch and it was terrific on both occassions. The food quality is outstanding as is the overall ambiance. The restaurant has indoor and outdoor seating with plenty of views of their amazing pool and MBS. The servers are very knowledgable and even offer multiple types of spread for their house made bread. It is hard to recommend a specific dish but I loved the lobster bisque and the risotto as well as the Iberico pork chop
5
Dining with my family to celebrate my brother belated birthday as we will never forget the Zuppa di Funghi (Mushroom soup), that was the best in the world that so far i tasted.Yes we repeated for the dish again. We arrived about 1900 hrs where the restaurant was not busy. After being seated and the cosy area we were asked for drinks, menu were given as well.Giri was very polite and attend to our needs. The servers were very attentive.Service and the food quality same as before, never disappoint us...Will return for more..
5
My fiance took me here for a recent birthday dinner. We live in Singapore, so I wasn't overly excited by eating at hotel restaurant, even a nice one. My mood quickly shifted though -- the service, food, wine and even music were fantastic! We had the degustation menu with wine pairing -- really amazing. and the service was really attentive without being imposing. I'd definitely recommend this place
5
It was our last night in Singapore so we wanted a relaxed atmosphere, lovely setting and good food at a reasonable price. Dolce Vita beat our expectations on all accounts. The maitre'd gave us such a warm welcome and the staff (thanks, Vanessa) was exceptional. We were seated poolside on a lovely evening with a stunning view of the Marina Sands and downtown Singapore. The menu selections were comforting, but tempting at the same time (fabulous carbonara). We had spent 30 days in Asia and were ready to depart from Asian food. We were not disappointed. The food was excellent and for the quality, location and service, the price was reasonable for Singapore standards
5
We went to Dolce Vita for our anniversary dinner and had an amazing time. The food was awesome, service incredible and amazing setting by the pool with a good view of the singapore skyline. The staff went extra step to explain the details of each dish we ordered and made good recommendations based on our preferences. They also arranged a small anniversary cake and sang a beautiful song for us which really made the night special. We had the perfect dinner and would highly recommend this place
4
Look, if price is an issue for you, dont come here. If not come for the amazingly wonderful and friendly service, good food and eclectic wine list. The restaurant is on the fifth floor overlooking the swimming pool and in the not too distant horizon, The Marina Bay Sands. It is really quite lovely, but at a price
5
Such a wonderful experience, had Brunch and it was brilliant and so well presented including the never ending supply of champagne that came my way.
4
good location....nice free peanuts....cold beer...nice stafff...cold beer....cold beer and cold beer
5
We had a great dinner here, the food was incredible and the atmosphere was fantastic. We can have food while enjoying music and the views to Marina Bay. Staffs were friendly and helpful. They made every detail to make sure that our dinner completely perfect 
5
An outside table close to the pool and overlooking the harbour vista set the tone for a memorable dining experience.Food was of world class standard and the service was impeccable.Even during the busiest time of the night the level of service never fell below first class. During the quieter times the maitre'd and the waiting staff stopped to chat and make sure that everything was up to standard with the meal and also the rest of our hotel stay
5
Just spent 3 days at the gorgeous Mandarin Oriental in Singapore and decided to spend our last evening at the Dolce Vita. We chose to sit outside on the picturesque terrace overlooking Marina Bay, beautiful location and view. Food was amazing, exquisitely prepared and presented. Many thanks to Jan the restaurant Manager for ensuring our evening went smoothly. Service was naturally outstanding. Cannot wait to visit again when we are next in Singapore
5
Everything we had here was spectacular. The waiter talked us through each course, how it had been cooked and what was special about it, which made us feel very special. The oyster in particular was of course incredible. The food was interesting without being over-complicated or fussy, Great food, great wine, great service
5
Had a 40th birthday celebration here with a group of 30 people here. It was to say the least one of the best dining experiences I've had in Singapore. The Dolce Vitae brunch stands out as they send a massive selection of fresh starters (oysters a big hit) and main courses to your table in an orderly fashion. If there is a starter or main that you particularly liked they will send you out more if requested. Everything is cooked fresh and you can see the chefs busy at work in the background. The whole dining experience took 3 hours with free flow champagne, beer and cocktails. I never made it to dessert but this was the only '' buffet'' feel about the brunch. There appeared to be a large selection of desserts on display. The staff were particulary nice and friendly especially the German restaurant manager. We had a great afternoon. Fantastic views of Singapore also. Waiting to go back but it requires an occasion. Worth every penny. This brunch is on a Saturday only and you need to book in advance. I think the restaurant can take up to 60 people+ with some tables outside but too hot to eat outside in Singapore. Enjo

I had the pleasure brunching at Dolce Vita a couple of weeks ago and I have to say it was one of the most enjoyable brunches I have ever experienced.Initially I was underwhelmed with the amount of food brought out for the starter course (being a big eater!), however once I tasted the delights of the crab and avocado mousse and the butternut squash velouté I realised I was in for a treat! The staff also quickly informed us that we could order more of any dishes that we would like more of.There was a fantastic choice of main courses, with the duck and cherry sauce being my particular favourite, and the fact that the courses were well spread over three hours meant that there was plenty of time to enjoy the top-drawer desserts – crème brulée being the highlight for me! The standard of service was also to be commended, especially given my experience of restaurant service in Singapore was poor in general.We were there for the weekend of the Grand Prix, so we were able to enjoy fantastic views of the race track next to Marina Bay after brunch, which truly topped off the afternoon. The only downside was my sister getting trapped in the toilet after the door malfunctioned, before the restaurant manager freed open the door and offered her a free drink for her inconvenience! Despite this minor blip, and the sky high prices I would gladly recommend this restaurant
5
We read the reviews on Trip Advisor and we we decided to eat here on our last night in Singapore.We were welcomed in by friendly staff, it was a very nice atmosphere. We ordered food and drinks which came fairly quickly, the food was absolutely delicious.We had the Italian food like pasta, lobster bisque with scallop and chicken soup, which were obviously freshly made and good portion. Tiramisu cake dessert was also amazing! The price was quite high but it's great value for money. Thank you for such a pleasant evening.Definitely going back again
5
An unfortunate start as the rstuarant wasnt ready 20 minutes prior to my table booking.Eventually fter a little unpleasant exchange my party was allowed inside.The service is outstanding, the food very good. Menu in truth is a little limited, but adequate.The foie gras starter was extremely good but at over $30 it should have been. Three of my party had soup and they said it was excellent but the soup bowls were minute.The main courses were well cooked and tasty but miniscule portions.Good food but ridiculous prices
5
Had light dinner outside sitting in chill out area on cushions with view of main restaurant and pool as marina bay. Had pizza and drinks. Delicious. Service was great and not pushy. Thy wanted till late for us even after closing time.
5
This was a very very enjoyable evening to celebrate my birthday. The menu and paired wines were just fantastic, little pricey but so worth it for a special occasion, wait staff attentive without intruding, balance just right. Will definitely return.
5
Quality food, attentive service. You can tell, there is a real professional in the kitchen ;) Not cheap but perfect for special occasions.

My husband and I have just returned from a nine night trip to Singapore. After reading the reviews on Trip Advisor we decided to go to Dolce Vita at the Mandarin Oriental. It was a lovely restaurant with tables outside by the pool and an amazing view of the bay/city. You looked across to Marina Bay Sands Hotel which is spectacular and Singapore Flyer.We ordered a bottle of wine which they had run out of in the main restaurant so asked if we minded waiting while they went down to the basement to get another bottle. This was no problem at all. As it took a few minutes longer than they expected we were given a glass of champagne each which was a lovely gesture.We ordered the lobster which was prepared very simply and was delicious. We would highly recommend you visit Dolce Vita.KerrieSydne

We were staying at the Mandarin and decided not to venture out for dinner one evening. Dolce Vita serves good Italian food especially the buffalo mozzarella appetizer and the mushroom soup. Pasta dishes were solid choices as well. It is quite expensive and overpriced relative to what you get but the service was good as was the wine list
5
When a really special occasion comes around, we need an assurance of a venue that will provide not only world-class cuisine & ambience, but also world-class service - a warm personal touch that makes a lasting impression. Dolce Vita at Mandarin Oriental Hotel is such a restaurant.I scouted several possible venue in advance to ensure that my wife's upcoming birthday goes perfectly. From the first contact with Dolce Vita using their online reservations, the service has been upbeat & professional. I made an online reservation one evening and by morning, I had received an email response from the Dining Reservation Executive, JOANNE. We had 3 exchanges of email within 12 hours and I was setup to recee the restaurant within just 24 hours of my online reservation. In the age of technology & social media this sets a new benchmark for online service. Great job, Joanne!When I arrived at the restaurant, the Restaurant Manager, JIM IMHOFF, was there to greet me. Though the restaurant was quite crowded on that busy Saturday evening, he discretely navigated me between the tables and showed me to a quiet corner that had the best view of the poolside as well as the city skyline. Jim had even suggested for a table for 2 that is obstructing the city view to be removed to cater for my needs. I was very pleased that the restaurant would "sacrifice" a strategically located table, just so that my family & I can have a great view while dining at the restaurant.My 14 year old daughter was with me - assisting me to evaluate the venues and giving me useful feedback from a teenager's point of view. Jim treated her like a young lady during the recee session, and she was impressed. She naturally gave her vote for Dolce Vita and that confirmed the choice.After my recee, I followed through with other details of the arrangements - a special Tiramisu Birthday cake, with extra ingredients, to be prepared; specific seating positions with small table cards/labels with guest names; plus the evening's agenda to be followed. Jim took care of everything perfectly and I was again impressed by the response time to emails & Jim's attention to details. Jim had also emailed to me a softcopy of Dolce Vita's new menu in advance and offered to customised a set dinner for me, if required.The special evening arrived and as my family stepped into Dolce Vita, we were ushered to our table and were seated in the correct order. The staff were very attentive and did not rush us as we took our time to place the order. Everything on the menu looks great and we did take a very long time to decide!I started off with Zuppa d'astice (Lobster bisque minestrone with seared Hokkaido scallop and basil pesto). Incidentally, it is also my wife's favourite soup. This is one of the best Lobster bisque soup that we had tasted. It is really good in comparison with the lobster bisque soup that we had savoured in many other fine dining restaurants. Highly recommended.For the main meal, I ordered the Filletto di manzo - Dry aged Angus beef tenderloin with celeriac purée, balsamic glazed baby vegetables, foie gras air and port jus. I requested for this to be done "Medium" and it turned out perfectly. It is so good that I unabashedly cleaned up everything on the plate.After the main meal, Jim and his dedicated restaurant crew cooperated with me as I video captured the entire birthday cake "march-in" with the spirited singing of "Happy Birthday" that caught my wife by surprise. Bonus score for this great service.The specially ordered Tiramisu cake was heavenly. My mum-in-law's comment on this was that she had never tasted a better Tiramisu cake before. This carries a lot of weight, simply because she helps her son who is a chef/owner of an Italian restaurant to prepare Tiramisu cakes. Most of all, my wife who is the toughest critic for Tiramisu cakes gave her thumbs up to it. Compliments to the chef who prepared the birthday cake. As you can see from the photo, the presentation of the cake screams "Birthday bash!".I did not savour the full range of courses for this dinner as I was engrossed in photographing the event in this captivatingly beautiful Italian restaurant. So I had to rely on the guests who gave their approval for the following dishes that they had ordered :-1) Zuppa di funghi - Wild forest mushroom soup with mushroom timbale and white truffle foam. My kids are lovers of mushroom soup and they were very pleased with it. 2) Carbonara - my 14 year old daughter feels that this is the purest test for a Italian pasta dish. What was left of the generous serving of Carbonara was a shiny white empty plate. It was superb.3) Cannelloni con coda di bue e foie gras - Oxtail and foie gras cannelloni with creamed spinach and parmesan tuile. My father-in-law loves Oxtail and he think this is a good dish.4) Medaglione di vitello al prosciutto. Prosciutto wrapped medallion of milk-fed veal tenderloin with potato purée, asparagus, fricassée of morel and Madeira sauce. This was the Birthday Girl's choice and she gave it 2 thumbs up. The chef gave us a complimentary dish,“Zuppetta di pesce all’acqua pazza” - A traditional Italian family dish comprising seafood braised in shellfish broth with spring onion, potatoes, fennel and cherry tomatoes. A good dish, except for the fish being slightly overcooked. Perhaps I am nit-picking here or else this review would not be believable if I gave everything a perfect score. Lol.Special thanks goes to the Chef de Cuisine, JOHNNY MEITEI and his team who were behind all the beautiful creations for the delightful evening.Last but not least, I wish to give due credit to RHEA, who took care of the family at the table and turned an "ordinary" celebration into an enchanted one with her wonderfully warm service. Her passion for each of the guests radiates through the entire evening. She checks back regularly with everyone at the table that everything is ok - and she does so without becoming intrusive. Great table service, Rhea!I wish to congratulate the Director of Food and Beverage at Mandarin Oriental Singapore, Mr. Etienne Francois, for leading such an extraordinary team of service staff who have demonstrated the art of delighting customers. From end to end, I am exceptionally pleased with Dolce Vita and give it my highest accolade & recommendation

We visited Dolce Vita based on TA recommendations for our wedding anniversary dinner. We were very happy with the choice....service was impeccable. Every single person on the serving staff was outstanding. At least for me great service contributes to about 50% of a meal's success! Food was pretty good and wine selection is extensive. I wish there is a more extensive vegetarian menu...it would inspire me to dine there more often! Location is perfect for a celebratory / special dinner
5
I visited Dolce Vita several times during my stay at the Mandarin Oriental in August 2013. The food was outstanding and even at the high price point (up to GBP 50 per person for dinner without alcohol) represented good value for money.I enjoyed several pasta dishes and perhaps the best pork chop (Iberico pork from Spain, served with parsnip foam, olives and fennel) that I have ever had. Be sure to try the lime juice as well!Since the restaurant is by the pool it is convenient to pop in for lunch if you are having an at the hotel day. Staff are extremely friendly and remembered my name after the first visit.Highly recommended

It was supposed to be a celebration evening... Didn't expect such substandard treatment from a 5-star hotel bar. We called the night before to ask if reservation is needed for Bar@5 (knowing that everyone will crowd to watch the fireworks) & the answer was no, its walk-in & 1st come 1st serve basis.So, we arrived around 5.30pm, tables & daybeds around the platform occupied, we are fine to wait for seats as it was still early. We asked if we can sit at the Dolce Vita table & have drinks first, Supervisor Jan came to us & said no, business starts in 10mins & its already reserved. Ok, fine. Then, we ask if can we order drinks & stand around while waiting for table since we are only 3rd in que. Shocking answer was "No"!Ok, fine. We are in composure as to not let it spoil our evening and said we will wait then. Kevin, being the only friendly &helpful staff, manage to sort out a seating for us in less than 10 mins. We ordered our drinks & look forward for the fireworks. We observed the que & treatments, thinking maybe we are not room guest that's why the priority was not given to. Sadly, the climax of the ugly impression was when our drinks were not done before the fireworks, another supervisor Giuseppe ask if he can open up the table for other guest. Clearly no one was in que & everyone would rather stand at poolside at that moment to have unblock view of the fireworks (our table is at semi blocked view). We enjoyed the national day fireworks then ask for customer feedback form. Then came the apologetic supervisor Jan to do explaination & Kevin bring us complimentary drinks to apologize. Sorry, damage is done. We told Kevin we appreciate his hospitality but its management need to buck up. It piss me off so much that how can a service industry made its guest feel 2nd class. We had stayed a few times in this hotel a few years ago & it was memorable & thought we visit the refreshed look of the swimming pool but with this kind service, it totally destroy all the good memories & impressions

Dolce Vita includes a lounge outside the restaurant, which serves drinks and a small menu using a subset of the restaurant staff. It is a gem of a location in the evenings, which we really enjoyed for the view and the excellent service and menu. One visit in 2012, I ordered a grappa they did not have, and the earnest server went out to purchase several others and give a tasting to find the next best thing. Another visit in 2012, we took our parents and shared a delicious charcuterie plate and seafood plate. In those visits, I would have rated the lounge a 4 or 5. Pricey food and drinks, but a fun experience with good food and service.Our most recent visit in 2013, however, showed that some things have changed for the worse. The service was much slower and inattentive, telling us they would bring snacks with the drinks and then not doing so; not serving drinks at the same time and taking much too long to bring them; etc. The menu had also changed and had fewer selections for sharing; what was left was more like hotel room service than something special to enjoy in a beautiful setting. We brought a friend visiting Singapore there for the first time, telling him how good it was, and were disappointed by the showing. Given that the prices were just the same, this once shiny gem has lost its sparkle for us
3
Though the restaurant has a lovely setting at the roof of the Mandarin, both food and service was underwhelming. Friends and I had the set menu. Chicken was overcooked, food was not served properly (wine did not come in proper order). Overall a disappointing experience.
5
Wonderful brunch as always. Food is always great, but it's the service that makes me go back here time and time again. It's a very fine line balancing professionalism, attentiveness and friendliness - to much of any of these can make for an uncomfortable experience but Jan and team (especially May) provide such genuine heartfelt service, it's always like going visiting friends. I'm really happy to see all the hard effort get recognized by making it to number 1 on here - very well deserved. Keep up the great work team and see you again in a few weeks. Ma

We were staying at the Manadarin Oriental and having arrived from UK only hours earlier, we couldn't be bothered with going out. We're glad we stayed in the hotel and ate here.You have the option of sitting inside or out; the view outside is a typical city skyline anf the Marina Bay hotel.Whilst we can't remember what we had, the memory of a very good meal and exemplary service still lingers.Definitly the best of the three evening meals we had in Singapore
5
When we first got to the restaurant, we were stunned at the set up of the restaurant and how quiet and peaceful it was. We were served by a young lady called Kristine and she was the best waitress we have ever had in Singapore, this goes for all the staff. Impeccably presented food was served in a polite fashion and all staff were very attentive. The food itself was amazing. We were expecting a set out buffet but what you find is they serve you all the food that is on the brunch menu. This is a little different but we found we preferred it to the normal brunch layout. The food sizes were just right and there was a great selection that could fit everybody's taste. Overall, a very enjoyable meal and great value for money, the best restaurant in Singapore as far as we are concerned
5
We had a great evening at Dolce vita, the staff were fantastic and the food was gorgeous. Our starters (the lobster and crab dishes) were amazing and our main courses did not disappoint. The setting is lovely, overlooking the pool and marina. It was our priciest meal in Singapore, but one of our most memorable
5
We had arranged a weekend in Singapore with our whole family to celebrate our daughter's 21st birthday. Our selection was based largely on the comments of other reviewers. We do not know Singapore well enough to have experience of many top class restaurants. A phone call 3 days beforehand confirmed the reservation. A very helpful response (with an immediate offer to organise the birthday cake) gave me a good feeling. With our party numbering 10 they requested we place our menu selections beforehand. From the moment we arrived, we were made to feel very special guests and everything came out together, very well presented and perfectly prepared. Service was attentive but not overbearing and nothing was too much trouble, including asking the staff to take numerous photos to record the occasion. Food was delicious, wine list was extensive (although we kept to the same prosecco & chianti throughout) and the overall environment of the restaurant was fantastic. We could not have made a better choice for a special celebration
4
We were staying at the Ritz but decided to go over the fence and try Dolce Vita next door. It was a short walk thru the Marina Square. We didn't make any reservations but they quickly accommodated us. Oh the presentation was exquisite, taste out of this world. Of course price is as hotel as it can get if you know what I mean. But the view of the Singapore skyline snd visual effects over at the sands, well it is an experience
5
I have chosen Dolce Vita restaurant for my husband birthday and we Will go back for sure!We had a romantic ambiance (table by the pool), service was great (manager and waiters are discrete, and cared), delicious gastronomic , fabulous desert and they especially prepared a birthday cake.We look forward to going back
5
Surprises and service of the staffs made our anniversary really special!Food is uncomparable! Compliments to the chef!Thanks to giri and his staffs as well as the three lovely singers vanessa, razel and paner.Thank you so much we will never forget our wonderful experience in dolce vita. More power
5
We booked a table here for our last night in Singapore based on TA reviews-it certainly did not disappoint. We were with our children aged 8 and 5 and they were welcomed and catered for, even though to all extents this is a fine dining establishment.Our waiter Kevin, and his fellow staff members provided faultless service from start to finish.The food was exquisite and the views across marina bay made the ambience very special.Kids can order half sizes from the menu, or from the poolside menu eg burgers and pizza etc. Ours had pasta and the penne with meat ragu was amazing!We had vitello and fillet steak for mains and they were top notch.But it was the little touches that made the evening-the service, the attention to the children and their needs, the photograph taken by the waiter and given to us at the end of the meal on a commemorative display card, along with a long stemmed red rose for myself.Well done Dolce Vita, you gave us an amazing night out
5
I've been living in Singapore for three years and this is by far my favorite restaurant. The black and white risotto (truffle taste with foie gras) is amazing but they also have many others very good dishes.
Service is also very good.
5
Not often that the hype and ratings on this site match my experience, in this instance, though, my meal last night at Dolce Vita was quite memorable. As others have said, great food, service, staff, follow through, all true.I was late getting there, within an hour of closing for the evening, yet I was still warmly welcomed. My server May was one of the finest servers I have had anywhere at any time, that perfect blend of professionalism, charm, attention to detail, friendliness, elan, and pride; she clearly loves what she does and excels at it also. The restaurant should never let her go, and in fact should make her the manager or head trainer or both; she was that good.Anyway, food-wise, I had quite the variety, starting with a caesar salad, not on the menu which they made for me from scratch. Then a serving of lobster minestrone, with the lobster in the bowl and then the soup poured tableside over the lobster -quite the nite touch. Then I had the carbonara which was exceptional also, and thanks to May only ordered a half size since it is so rich and I had more food coming. Then for my main, I had fish with seafood risotto, again, stunningly done to perfection and a nice portion too. So quite the mix of textures and flavors, each surpassing the one previously. I should add, quite wonderful bread with an assortment of spreads, and even a special tasting from the chef, quite good also.Each course was perfectly orchestrated by May and the other staff, using a team approach, to only enhance the dining experience. I even was having trouble reading the menu because I was in a darker table with no over head direct light, and they had a light for me to clip on the menu, kind of thinking of everything...This combination of service, food, atmosphere and staff made the evening great, and I fully understand why it is rated so high in Singapore, quite simply it is that good.One small item, I have had better tiramisu, just not up to the standard set by the rest of the meal. May told me that the chef uses his family recipe proudly. I cant argue with that really just was a slight let down to compare with all of this other stellar food and flavor.This was a top meal for sure in any hotel I have been to anywhere

We booked this place for a birthday solely based on how it looked from the outside and were hoping that it does not disappoint and it did not! Instead, we left the place with everyone giving it a two thumbs up and we are sure to return again.The location of this restaurant is next to the poolside of Mandarin Oriental, with a nice al-fresco area at its front, facing the marina area (which by the way has fireworks displays during the National Day rehearsals till August). This set up makes it into a very beautiful dining place, with lots of natural lighting and a soothing feel to it. Half the walls are glass so it looks lovely especially if the weather is good.Service - those with children will appreciate this. From the moment we sat down, we had smiling waiters and waitresses coming over and they made sure our little one was comfortable, told us that they could do their dishes in small portions and said if we needed her food cooked straight away in case she was hungry, just let them know. It is so pleasant to be able to go to a restaurant which makes all adult guests happy and yet have service staff who takes care of your little one so that the entire dining experience becomes a happy one. They also won our little girl's heart when they came by with a complimentary apple juice for her!The service here was top notch - pleasant, warm and not overbearing. Very attentive without hovering over you and just delightful through out the night. Still, a restaurant needs to have good food to be a top notch one and Dolce Vita hits the right spot here. We eat Italian a whole lot and I like seeing how the simplest pasta gets prepared as it usually tells how well the pasta was cooked. The carbonara pasta was perfectly al dente. Tasty, without being over-creamy and not overwhelming with too much cheese.We also tried the angus beef steak, the cod fish, and the risotto. Every dish was two thumbs up.As we were celebrating a birthday, they also provided a complimentary cake (which was also really good!). Such a wonderful wonderful place to be and simply delightful in every way
5
I went here for a last minute champagne brunch on my last weekend in Singapore and what an amazing brunch to finish up with. Everything was faultless, from the fantastic service, the great concept of having the stunning Italian food brought to you and the stunning view across the pool. The food consisted of 10 mini portions for appetizers and 9 for the main courses, but you could ask for as much as you wanted. One of my memorable meals in Singapore
5
While in Singapore we were looking for a nice restaurant for our final night, we were not disappointed! Service was fantastic, everything was explained, every question answered and every need met. The food was excellent and if I could have fit more in would have eaten more! It was fresh and presented well. Would definitely recommend to others
5
I took my best friend to treat him in the restaurant Last week. My friend being a traveller, he really loved the view and ambience. Overall view, food and the impeccable service made our evening as a very memorable one. The staffs even presented us our picture as a memorable gift. The Angus beef tenderloin with foie gras is a must to try. The staff named Vanessa is very kind and humble. Definitely I will visit again and highly recommendable to my friends
5
In a city like Singapore, where good service is not always an easy thing to find, Mandarin Oriental once again shows its mastery by running this Italian-Mediterranean restaurant at its level 5, right on the poolside. Stunning view on the whole Marina Bay, romantic terrace right on the poolside (al fresco tables are a must try), attentive and genuine service together with great food creations (to be mentioned: Grilled asparagus with Iberico de Bellota ham, mozzarella di bufala and morel ragout, Shellfish ravioli with half Maine lobster, crispy leek and Champagne foam, Herb-crust lamb medallion with Sicilian-style eggplant caponata). When I was there with my girlfriend, they also arranged a surprise cake and a red rose for her birthday, presented while singing happy bday, and some near tables also joined the song...a perfect night! Next time I will also definitely try their Bay@5 lounge right in front of the restaurant...it looks marvelous..

Went for a quick bite for dinner. Shared some apps and had a pasta. I must say the food was very good and the service was attentive. Was surprised that there were so few people in the restaurant though.... may have been a good thing! There were a few people sitting outside that would have been a bit too hot for our party's liking. Would certainly come back
4
We spent our last night in the Mandarin Oriental at this restaurant and like everything else associated with the MO we were not disappointed . Very attentive staff who brought out well presented and delicious meals, with the desserts being the stars of the meals! Well worth a visit
5
Booked a table for 6 to celebrate Dad's 67th. From the moment we stepped in, we were made to feel like 'royalty' ... yet all in a very comforting manner. Service was tip-top, with the menu explained with loving detail, attentive care at every turn, glasses were always kept filled and the food was exquisite. Had a lovely corner to ourselves and the ambience was perfect for a cosy and quiet gathering. Everyone made it a point not to make our experience a memorable one and yet made it a point not too present the Birthday cake in an outlandish fashion ... just how Dad prefers.All in all, a perfect evening with the best company in the very best hands. Kudos to all staff that evening
5
Food was sensational. Service is the best in town. Views gorgeous. Stylish and classy with a relaxed decor & attitude. Perfect for couples, families or business. A must. Go & enjoy.
5
The food was marvelous and the staff was friendly and polite...
Was one of the best experiences in Singapore and would surely visit again...
Keep it up :)
5
Expensive, but worth every penny. The staff and ambience of the room was brilliant, the meal too. My wife is Veggie, and they catered for her with ease and politeness. Will go there again.
5
One of the best experiences I had in many years. The personell was so lovely and professional and made us feel special. The food was excellent to a relativelly moderate price level. The atmosphere is delicate and the view wonderful. All in all this restaurant gets top score
5
Visiting the pool at the hotel, you canâ€™t avoid to see the Dolce Vita restaurant, and we went to dine here on our last evening in Singapore. With its Italian style of menu, and great selections of wine, it is a good rest from the Asian kitchen when visiting Singapore.Staff is very friendly, and gives you a great dining experience. Take the wine-pairing to the menu, its well-combined and gives you some variety.End the evening in the bar outside of Dolce Vita and enjoy the Singapore skyline
4
Eat here regularly when in Singapore as am based at the Mandarin Oriental, so on average between 4-6 times a year. My most recent trip in March 2013 I distinctly noticed a drop in quality. Whereas before I would have perhaps rated it 8/10 I would drop this to a 7/10 now. It was quite a significant drop in quality and I am comparing the same dishes over an extended period. When I asked if there were any changes I was advised that the Chef was no longer present as such but was now in an "advisory capacity". In my opinion they need to get the Chef back because they still charge like a wounded bull. Great position and fantastic views as always
5
Having arrived in Singapore after a long flight from the UK via Dubai, we didn't want to venture far from the hotel on our first evening. So after a quick reccie of the restaurants in the Mandarin Oriental we decided that the Dolce Vita was just what we were looking for. We weren't disappointed!!The food was superb, the service was excellent and the chilled prosecco was delightful. All in all a superb start to our holiday in Singapore and Malaysia to celebrate my wife's birthday. When the staff in the restaurant discovered that we were there for a birthday treat, they took our photo and presented it to my wife in a frame, along with a red rose as we were leaving. All of this does not come cheap, but as they say "quality costs", but we would not hesitate in returning.Thank you all at the Dolce Vita
4
This restaurant is one of the best Italian food joints in Singapore. Located in Mandarin Oriental, the food quality for this restaurant is fabulous, and the lunch menu sure is exhaustive.I would recommend this place specially if you're celebrating your anniversary or are planning on proposing ;)Do check out their wine collection
5
I ate at Dolce Vita a number of times both in groups and with my wife. The pleasantly decorated restaurant serves a fantastic champagne brunch with a generous tasting menu including oysters, squid ink pasta and there is no better way to spend a Saturday or Sunday afternoon in Singapore if you are a food and champagne lover. There are tables available outside but not only is it extremely humid, there are also frequent thunderstorms which may disrupt your meal
5
The restaurant is perfect for a light pool side nibble with accompanying drinks. The menu leans toward the most pleasant cuisine - i.e. Italian.For us Europeans, it felt a bit odd to sit in Singapore and decide between a light Pinot Grigio or something slightly heavier and headier. Finally we decided, and as a vegetarian I asked if one of the salads could be done without meat. Certainly. Still, it arrived with meat, and here the real surprise began. Even though I don't eat meat, I hate to stick out and make a fuzz about it, so I quitely transferred the few bits of (very delicious, as I heard) ham to my boyfriend's plate, who was very happy about this move. The food and the drinks were fantastic, so was the atmosphere, so the slight mistake was not only forgiven, but forgotten and almost unnoticable. We had almost devoured everything, when the waiter came to apologise. My move had obviously been noticed with a raised brow, and the restaurant felt bad about it. "No need to worry", I insisted, "really, I'm fine. Look, you've made my boyfriend really happy, don't worry about it." My boyfriend smiled happily, eager to demonstrate his happiness.Still, would we have a free dessert? No, no, we said, we are really happy, no worries. Not even a sorbet? It is very light? Ok, we gave in, enjoyed the sorbet and marvelled at the sight, the pool, the lightness and fruitiness of the sorbet and the superior service.Then the bill arrived. No mention of the sorbet. No mention of the - supposedly faulty - salad either (which we had eaten in its completeness). We were slightly confused, met with more apologies, and decided to leave a lavish tip.Service at its true and utter best.The Mandarin Oriental is truly and completely missed by us, and we will always remember its utter and relentless dedication to not only making customers happy, but to surprise them with outstanding service and hospitality.Very, very, very recommended
5
Fantastic food, simply but creative and fresh. Staff were very sweet and attentive. Location is lovely as well, especially the patio overlooking the pool and a great view. You cannot be disappointed.
5
The place are really perfect. Very nice view. Very friendly staff vanessa. Thank you to all the staffs.
5
The food was so delicious, the bread was very good and an awesome view. The staff was so friendly and the gave us a picture as well. We could watch the lights over the river as well.
5
Great food with high level of choice and quality
Slightly fusion theme but superb
Great atmosphere
Nice environment
Staff so attentive without being obvious
5
Went there to celebrate a birthday. Party of 8. Started with drinks at the lounge and proceeded to dinner. They had set aside a nice table for us next big french windows opening out to the pool. Food was excellent. Service was top-notch. Highly recommended.
4
Romantic setting, attentive service, lovely views, nice lighting and average/good food. Expensive but a very pleasant evening.
5
It was a very short visit in Singapore but it's all worth it. Our dinner at Vita was really awesome! The best Italian food I ever had, the menu has great variety of dishes. It was made extra special by the exceptional service by the staff, Vanessa was her name as I remember. She's very attentive and lovely. We will probably celebrate our anniversary on December at this restaurant
5
Authentic/traditional Italian food presented in a modern way.Restaurant is elegant & staff attentive.It's possibly the bestItalian food I've had outside Italy. The menu has a great variety of dishes, several options for vegetarians/pescetarians.Great ambiance & views of the city from the window or pool area
5
The Mandarin Oriental has this one nailed. Its cool for several reasons. Firstly its on a Saturday and the number of places offering a Saturday Champagne brunch in Singapore is falling fast. Secondly, and maybe most importantly, it delivers a classy brunch where you're served at your table with your friends/family. No piling up of plates at buffets, the buffet comes to you at your table. The food is delightful, really nothing like it and the champagne is quite special too. Definitely worth it for a special occassion and at Christmas (I went last year for Christmas) they really lay it all on - including Santa plus choir. Very well done where many hotels get this a little too average
5
The Dolce Vita is at pool level with a great view of the Singapore Flyer, The Marina Bay Sands hotel and the CBD of Singapore. The menu has a great variety and is excellent. No one in our group complained of any dish they had. You do not need to be a hotel guest to go to Dolce Vita, it is a great date restaurant as well
4
Food was good, but expensive (as is all sit down restaurants in Singapore). Had the carpacio, risotto, 3 pasta, and mushroom soup. All was very good although I think the risotto was the best! Overlooked the Mandarin Hotel's pool area.
4
A very impressive location and a very warm, sincere Service. Giuseppe and his team make my friend and me really feel at home.
4
We had a lovely evening eating a three course meal at this beautiful restaurant. As we sat watching the fireworks we had amazing cocktails. The food was exceptional to say the least. The service was good and we had a fantastic night. Thankyou :)
5
The menu did not give much options for someone who is a vegetarian and does not eat mushrooms. But the staff were extremely helpful. Gave us a lot of options and put together some very good Italian food. The location is fantastic open air and with a great view of the mArina sands. We got a good look at the laser show during our dinne
5
I had a business lunch here and everything was great! The service was prompt and non obtrusive, the food was wonderful! Every bite was good and I enjoyed the meal very much! The view is gorgeous.. There's a view of the swimming pool on the left and up front is the view of the Singapore harbour. The most memorable dishes were the Zuppa di astice (Lobster bisque with seared Hokkaido scallop and basil pesto) and Creme Brulee!
5
This was my first visit to Dolce Vita and the evening was absolutely outstanding. From arrival to when we left the experience was intimate, relaxed and the service outstanding. My husband and I shared a couple of starters - the buffalo tradizionale and the grilled asparagus with iberico ham. The presentation was excellent and both dishes were delicious. My husband had the lobster bisque which he enjoyed and for mains we had the veal escalope and barramundi. The food was delicious, portions were a decent size, so much so that I had no room for dessert. The only criticism of the barramundi was that the skin was soggy rather than crisp but apart from that I could not fault the dish.The staff were very attentive and made us very welcome. We ordered a bottle of red wine from the sommelier's choice which was definitely the right thing to do. We sat outside and whilst it was great to look over Singapore, the chairs are designed so you cannot sit back comfortably so after dinner we moved to Bay@5 bar opposite the restaurant for drinks and the chance to relax back in comfier chairs. Mandarin Oriental please change those chairs!All in all it was a superb evening and I highly recommend this as a great place for an intimate relaxing dinner.Yes its not cheap, but worth the money for this experience
4
I have dined here on several occasions with business colleagues & have always sat outside by the pool. Evenings are best with the lights of the Marina Bay area starting to come on. The service has been courteous & attentive. The cooking was excellent & all the chef's choices did not disappoint. It seems like when in a group I enjoy myself the most. I have been here alone but it didn't have the same impact. Prices are not going to be cheap but then you would already have gathered that. Surprised to read TravelGeekz' review as it was totally contrary to my experience. Definitely not a bog standard hotel restaurant by any means
5
Fantastic experience !From the time we sat down until we left this restaurant was a 5 star dining experience.We had a three course dinner for two with a nice bottle of wine and few cocktails after and the food and the service was superb.If you stay a the mandarin oriental you have to dine here at least once
2
Dolce Vita is the franchise of Michelin Star chef Marco Pedrelli. It has been voted as one of the best Italian restaurants in Singapore by various media. However, our experience was certainly disappointing and this restaurant was much overrated!Upon our arrival, we were guided to our table outdoors as requested. It had a lovely view over the Marina Bay Sands and the CBD. We could see the laser light show from there. The environment itself could be the only good thing about this place.The food was nothing special. We ordered ths roasted eggplant and lobster bisque as the starter. The soup was a bit salty and there was only a small piece of scallop. For the middle course, we had the mushroom and truffle risotto. It was over cooked.The main courses were the Welsh lamb and roasted Dover Sole. They were both nicely presented but the lamb was way over cooked (I asked for medium) and had no meaty taste while the fish was very plain. Dessert was pretty much the best of the meal. The dark chocolate bar had a rich texture and taste. The tiramisu was also good.The overall service was very slow and not up to standard. We had to wait for quite a long time to get the menu and the bill. The staff was not attentive enough. Our memory of a Mandarin Oriental's restaurant experience (from Hong Kong) was far much better!As a HSBC credit card holder, we enjoyed a 15% discount to the bill which was definitely a bonus for us as the meal was certainly not worth the price! We are not coming back anytime soon
3
I took some work colleagues to Dolce Vita this week for drinks and dinner. It's what you would expect in a bog hotel: nice decor, attentive service (if a little scripted), good Italian food etc.I paid the bill in a fit of generosity but later wished I hadn't - over $500 for 4 people, and we didn't ordered that much. Definitely a $$$$ price tag
3
Risotto ai tartufi, very good indeed. The tatar as well. Profiteroles also. Portions on the smaller side, prices ridiculously high, even for singapore, even for the mandarin oriental.
2
Last weekend I really felt like a steak and after reading the reviews headed to the Mandarin Oriental. Lovely flash Asian hotel, love the feel, lots of classy people dressed up and it felt good to part of it. Went in, ordered a steak, very attentive (but also very cold) service - would not smile if their life depended on it.The steaks arrived and mine was over-done. I sent it back and its replacement was smaller, cooked properly this time but it was tough. got the bill and OMG it was extortionate
4
I was pleasantly surprised with this restaurant, the food was very good and the waiters really knew their menu. The menu was expensive enough to suit all palates and persuasions. My husband had informed them it was my birthday, so I was presented with a small cake and a lovely rose, which was a very nice touch. All in all, a very good Italian
5
I thoroughly enjoyed the evening. The service was exceptional. The views absolutely wonderful. I enjoyed eating outside. Some may prefer the interior for a more elegant experience since the outdoor seating is by the pool. But my favorite part of the evening was the view of the Singapore Flyer, the Marina Bay Sands and the financial district which are more visible from the outdoor seating. The food was fine but I would go back for the view and experience, not the food. With the price, it is something I would do one evening in a trip
5
My husband and I had an early dinner here before our late night flight. Initially we weren't very hungry, but once we started eating we didn't want to stop !The waitress and sommelier referred to us all evening by our names, even though we weren't staying at the Mandarin. We ordered an antipasto platter, even though this wasn't on the menu. The components were simple - cheeses, meats, vegetables and home made grissini - but each one was spectacular.My pork main course was the BEST pork dish I think I've ever eaten. My husband's seafood pasta was also very good.At a cost of S$200 for two, including two glasses of French red, we were very happy
5
Most hotels have brunches were you need to constantly get up form your table and select your own food that half the time is well picked over luke warm or luke cold.Not at Dolce Vita they give you a menu of all the things available and you can chose which ones to try and they are bought to your table straight form the kitchen. And if you like one particular item you can just order it again.This has to be the most civilised brunch I have been too.The appetisers are and interesting range. The pasta dishes are perhaps the biggest letdown but the grilled meats are nicely charred not over cooked and bough to the table at just the right temperatur
5
After an early arrival in Singapore, quick shower, and a hot morning shopping it was great to get back to the Mandarin and relax. First with a fantastic light lunch at la Dolce Vita and the by the pool. Service at the restaurant was exquisite, extremely attentive and catering to our specific needs. Food delicious. The beef carpaccio amongst the best and their snapper superb. Coffee was also extremely good
4
Interesting and good concept of table serving avoiding the traditional brunch buffet. Good service and generous serving of champagne or other vines in the 3 hr window. Food was ok but lacked some taste, should skip the odd stuff like cheek and tail and at least serve some of the classics
5
I had arranged a business dinner at the Dolce Vita for two guests traveling from outside of Asia. The restaurant is situated on the 5th floor of the Mandarin Oriental Hotel. You actually have to walk outside the hotel on onto the same outdoor area that the hotel's swimming pool is located. To your right as you arrive is some lovely outdoor seating with a view across to the Marina. Yes you can see the Merlion, the Marina Bay Sands and most of the skyline. The restaurant proper is then on your left and there is seating both indoors and outdoors.The restaurant offers Italian Cuisine and has an excellent selection. What made the evening most memorable was the service. I arrived early and sat in the outdoor area to await my guests. I was graciously waited upon and as soon as my guests arrived they were promptly seated and also quickly served a cold refreshment. And the service standard continued as we dined in the restaurant. The meals were excellent and I felt they were very reasonably priced.I would highly recommend this restaurant for private or business dining and is really a hidden gem
5
My family and I had lunch at Dolce Vita since we are checked in at the hotel. The food was superb! And the service was top notch!! I loved my foie gras and the rest of my family members enjoyed their hearty meals as well! After lunch, they took a picture of us and later on surprised us with this nice frame with the photo which they just took of us! It was indeed a very memorable day. I certainly recommend this Italian restaurant which such friendly and smiling service staff
5
Their food are excellent!
Their truffle risotto, mushrooms soup are wonderful! Other food have good standard as well.
The environment are just as the standard of Mandarin Oriental.
The service are slient but promptly.
5
The Sashimi was very well prepared. Great service. Nice view in front of the pool.
4
We dinned in this restaurant twice during our stay. Both times we foung the food to be well presented and enjoyable. The atmosphere was relaxing especially after a hard days shopping.
3
We had dinner here yesterday evening. service good although we had specifically asked for the wine to be served with the main course this did not happen and white wine warmed up as there was a timing problem. Waitress offered by herself to replace the warmed up wine. Knowledge of staff on food like aging of beef and origin halibut limited and incorrect.The food was mixed in terms of excitement, starters were both quite good with morels, asparagus salad delicious being the best and then the crab salad with mango chutney followed by baramundi. Baramundi was lacking some juices or a sauce to complete this, fish perfectly cooked. However my Iberico porc dish lacked excitement and was a dull dish. I was therefore a bit disappointed they have to do better asking the prices they do and the stiff competition around
3
I have found a few great Italian restaurants in Singapore, but this is unfortunatly not one. The view and setting is lovely. The restaurant has an elegant, comfortable feel to it.The service was good however food was only average. There seemed to be a distinctly Asian flavor to this Italian cuisine which detracted from the Italian Feel and flavors. My reccomendaton is thoough this is a good place to eat others are better.
5
I wanted to eat at Morton's at the Marina Mandarin Hotel, but they were fully booked (couldn't even squeeze 1 person in before nine? C'mon . . . . .) So I went upstairs to the Dolce Vita, and it was a fantastic dining experience, the best restaurant meal I've eaten since Pederson's Krog in Sweden. The service from my Burmese waitress May was exceptional, really and truly one of the best waitresses I've ever had. The ambience was lovely. The food was utterly delicious. Forget Mortons when at the Mandarin. Go upstairs to the the sweet life, and eat at Dolce Vita. I highly recommend it
5
Fantastic food, service and location! My boyfriend ordered starters, while I did not want any. Despite this, the waiter gave me a complimentary small dish to enjoy. The food was amazing and the recommended wines matched perfectly.We ate outside and the scenery was superb! We saw the lightshow from the Marina Bay Sands and the skyline of Singapore.The waiter(s) was very service minded and attentive
5
Dolce Vita is a great restaurant, and my wife and I have dine there twice during our happy stay at Mandarin Oriental. Both indoor and outdoor dining are just as enjoyable, but we prefer the outside, because they have one of the most breath taking view of Singapore, facing Marina Bay Sands and Singapore Flyer. In terms of the food, they are top notch, but not only on the taste, but their artistic presentation also. Their service is just as consistent as the food quality, and we love it..
5
Celebrating on my dad birthday. The temperature at the outdoor during was just nice as natural air breezes on you from time to time. We've ordered soup as our starter. Their wild mushroom soup with truffle oil was the greatest soup that I've ever tried before. The main was good as well.

First I must write that I am French and, as such, I might seem a little bit fussy........ but I am not, am I ?There is a really very good point about this brunch: it works on SATURDAY. Because there are really few free flow champagne brunches available on Saturday. Whereas, I am certain you will agree with me, there should be brunch every day!The food is really good. Even if, at first sight, the fact that it is not a buffet might seem a drawback, I am recommending you the following: inside their set menu, choose what you want, I mean only the bit you want. For example, there is a « tenderloin with foie gras ». I do not like beef, so I order only the « foie gras part ». They did it and it was wonderful: the taste, the portion size was absolutely perfect.The first part of their main course menu is only pasta. I mean, only if you are a fan on Italian cuisine and go there for it, there is really no point of taking pasta on a week end brunch! We had to wait too long to get bread, this spoiled, just a little, the starters.The deserts were poor. The profiteroles have really nothing to do with what people who know call « profiteroles ». I am not saying it is bad, just that it is not the real stuff. If they find a new name for it, they might be acceptable.My wife liked their tiramisu. But it was the same you can find in any supermarket in Italy, nothing really special. And I liked the pistachio zabayone, unfornuately, it is served with an apricot cream that did not convinced me.Service is really good. They are professional and know how to pamper you. And, even if it is not a buffet and I find it more constraining, I would recommend the following: If you want more, just ask for it! And believe me, they will provide it to you.But for a reason I could not fathom, everything is slowThe Champagne is Mumm cordon rouge and is served at discretion.There is no cheese offered.....The price is, for Singapore, reasonable. But it is just a little bit less than Ritz-Carlton, and, believe me, there is no question, Ritz-carlton Greenhouse is much better.If you are lucky enough to be near the windows, the view is really nice.Eric
