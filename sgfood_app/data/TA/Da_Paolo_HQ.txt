Been to all da paolo branches, satisfied as always. Would never go wrong with their tuffle pizza. Tried harma ham w rocket this time, great too!
3
The inside is clean and modern. They have various kinds of healthy drinks.It will be a good start of a day to have brunch here, watching the local street.
1
Called restaurant's open branch elsewhere to explain the inconvenience of inviting friends to a booked restaurant that was actually closed. They still didn't get the availability changed on Chope.
3
I used the entertainer app for 1-1 promotion so it’s pretty okay for the food. Otherwise food might be a bit expensive. Spaghetti are well done, pizza so so.
4
Food was not bad, loved their pizzas and risottos! We ordered the vegan pizzas to try as well as the mushroom risotto & lobster one.
4
Busy busy place especially on weekends due to the proximity of Marina Bay Sands and the Museum.
Try the Blue Orange Mocha coffee and delectable meringues
4
Pastas are excellent & yummy, did I mention that their tiramisu taste so good! Service was relatively quite good. Overall somewhere I'd come back again when I crave for some good pastas.
3
Visited on a weekday afternoon with a friend for lunch. Both of us ordered pasta, and they were ok, but nothing memorable.
4
Good coffee is still difficult to find in Singapore. DPHQ Barista Serena us excellent. She takes so much care to get the grind correct which is difficult in humid conditions. Her Coffee is beautifully extracted with creamy milk. Other Baristas there are not as good but the bean (Italian) is robust enough to take the variation.If you are in the area grab a coffee or three
4
For a Friday night, this place is happening and has lots of energy. Club street has that feel. The pizza was great but the calamari was a little chewy though. Our server, Shaun, was absolute amazing.Took care of our needs completely throughout the night. I would always put service on top of my list. An he definitely deserves the shout out. I would come back again for sure
4
Very chill and easy going Italian restaurant. pizzas are tasty and of good size. Pasta dishes are great but a little creamy. Great friendly service and speedy. located in a chill part of club street. Give it a shot.
4
They served delicious pizza, pasta and risotto. Very chill ambience. Friendly and fast service staff
2
The restaurant was noisy and more like a cafe. Food was sub standard and not a lot of choices. I think they have lost the true authentic style of italian cooking.
5
Great value and reasonable prices. A real find in Overpriced Singapore. Super healthy choices available.
4
Very friendly stuff. Food was decent. The atmosphere was decent. It is a relatively good place for lunch.
4
Lunch set is not so expensive and the restaurant is quite nice, and the food is also not bad. Decor is also nice.
4
Second visit here. They have good happy hour sangrias. Pizza and pasta quality always good and consistent.
5
Located near Ang Siang hill where all good cafe and bars are situated at. Great place to chill after work for a meal while soaking in the relaxing atmosphere.
4
Our family of 4 had lunch here whilst we stayed two nights in Chinatown, it is a small Italian cafe, the interior is stylishly modern and quirky. The food is healthy, fresh and tasty, we ordered Paninis, salad, cappuccinos and fresh juices. Not cheap but if you're craving healthy European food, this is a good option. We really like the TV screens on the wall displaying gorgeous travel destinations, they are mesmerising to watch
3
Decided to have some drinks with friends after lunch. Didn't feel so welcomed but we still decided to be there since we like the set-up. Quite cosy. We just didn't feel happy positive vibes from the staff. Weekday lunchtime. Not busy when we were there. Felt like staff had an invisible wall serving us
3
Popped by for a quick desert and had a solidly executed tiramisu. Suspect it was kept chilled at too low a temperature as some moisture had left the desert but flavour was good.
4
excelllent place to grab breakfast with a little more class than the usual greasy bee hoon. enjoy their bakes and croissants. they do a decent cuppa too
5
The food is always great here, been several times. Pasta carbonara was great, pizza tasted nice and the Gratin alla Paolo is super. They have decent wines at reasonable prices. Service is also good. Will return for sure.
4
Good for a quick cuppa and sandwich as they open early. Food's decent and service is fast but nothing too fancy
3
Popped in here for lunch today and tried the lasagna. Quite tasty and a reasonable size, although I was still a little hungry after lunch. Not too busy on a weekday lunchtime and no reservation seems necessary.
1
Great food but will not ever go there again on Friday night. There was a large group of extremely loud people that attend every Friday night there, so loud it was giving people a headache. They could have moved outside if they wanted to shout in a restaurant and had no respect for the other people eating. The staff just shrugged it off, presumably they spend a lot on alcohol there so the staff don't want to upset them. So if you want a nice and enjoyable Italian dinner, DO NOT GO on Friday night to this restaurant. The food is great, but with that group there I will never go in the future
4
Went for lunch to Da Paolo HQ. Been here a couple times and was always good quality. Service is friendly. Price is normal, quality is good. I was a bit afraid of the quality of the tiramisu in plastic cup but ended up being good as well
4
Just loved the Greens & Grains whereOne can choose one item from 7Categories of green veg , cooked veg starch n non starchSeeds, protein & dressing! So healthy,Satisfying n good value for money!Nice ambiance and friendly staff. Will definitely go back again

@TheKuoKnowsYou can't really go too far wrong with a three-course set lunch for just $25 in the Central Business District. It's even more attractive when it's Italian food.I have tried Da Paolo on several occasions. And not once have I been disappointed, either with the food or the service.This time around I went for the Soup of the Day, which was very good. It was only superceded by the main course. This place really knows how to cook the perfct pasta....... I went for the Spaghetti with Olive Oil, Garlic and Mushrooms. Lots of flavour, lashings of parmesan cheese and a generous portion of mushrooms.The dessert menu was adequate. But I do object to paying extra for the Tiramisu. Just because an item is popular doesn't mean it should carry a premium. This is a restaurant not a surge-price taxi service
4
Da Paolo and a few other restaurants on Club Street, are the pioneers. This is one of my favourite restaurants and it has been a while since I have eaten here due to a very busy travel schedule. Hubby & I celebrated our 16th wedding anniversary dinner here. For starters, we had Squid Chermoula & Caprese. Both were fresh & excellent.For mains, we had Spaghetti al Nero de Seppia (squid ink pasta) and Margherita. I am not a pizza person but hubby is. The pizza is good but should have more fresh basil as toppings. The squid ink pasta was just too good. Had to eat carefully to prevent black-stained teeth!!We had no more room for sweets! Da Paolo is consistently good. Over the years, the food standards of Singapore has gone up significantly. Da Paolo's standards have not dropped, just remained consistently good. Years ago, Da Paolo was considered as fine dining. Now, it is ordinary fine dining that many mistook her for café food. She is not. She is better than café. And she has survived despite the tough F&B scene in Club Street & as a whole
5
Crab pasta is my fav at this place and would highly recommend it. Have yet to try the desserts as I always get too full after the pasta.
4
Enjoyed the food - the pizzas were good. The service was good as well and the area in general is great to hang out with friends at night.
3
We found this little restaurant in club street ideal for an early evening meal prior to strolling through nearby China Town and soaking in the atmosphere.
3
Food was relatively good. We had the indoor seat but we don't feel the cool air. The table they gave us was a long one which made us difficult to share our food. The waitress that served us was not very pleased when one of my friend asked for the menu for the 3rd time
4
Dap has been on Club St for ages. Here is the new edition: marble walls, naughty arcade, cosy corners AND at last pizzas!!Service is attentive with Saifee, food is good with a ++ for spaghetti alle Vongole. Dessert wise go for the tiramisu; booze wise the prosecco "Thierry's style" A must. Welcome back Dapaolo
2
asked for a non-smoking table and was given a table furthest from the outdoor smoking area. However, the whole restaurant reeked of cigarette smell as the doors were left open and they can't be closed. We were shifted to an outdoor table as that was the best alternative available. It was slightly better as it's alfresco. But we were exposed to the cigarette smoke from the surrounding restaurants. Not advisable for people who are sensitive to cigarette smoke and families with children to dine there. Food quality was average and price was a tad higher. We can get better quality air and food with the price paid.
4
Last week i bought my wife over there to celebrate her birthday.we have order calamari for starter,grill cod fish and pasta for main dish and tiramisu for dessert. The food is fresh and delicious except tiramisu little bit disappointed. The waitress is warm and courtesy,overall I will recommend to my friend
1
Was there for dinner and desserts at 9:30pm. And we received a very condescending service from the wait staff with pony tail. Ordered their veal jus ravioli. Sent it back to kitchen because the ravioli was still tough at bite, and undercooked. Sauce was also too salty. Mr pony tail questioned if I know that's a pasta I'm having, and if I know what ravioli is, and sent it back to the kitchen after the condescending remarks.He returned with an obviously diluted sauce by the look of the colour. But ravioli tasted just as undercooked. And sauce though looked paler, still as salty. Mr pony tail brisked past the table and asked if the food was ok, before I could reply he walked away. So much for "there's nothing more romantic than Italian food". With this kinda wait staff, nothing can be romantic here, at all, period. But I must say that the tiramisu didn't disappoint
4
This is a truly charming small restaurant with good food and thoughtful service.The manager is first rate and remembers his customers.The small menu offers genuine Italian fare with good pasta and fresh ingredients.For a relaxing lunch or intimate dinner it is a charming and delightful spot.Recommended highly
5
Last week my fiance and I were looking for something to eat at Ann Siang Hill/Clubstreet and found this hidden gem. This was my first time having dinner at this place and did not turn to disappoint us. Few dish been friendly recommended by the waitress and the flavors were amazing. We also had a good discussion with the Manager and he was very friendly and have professionalism in his career. Patience and style also funny with his jokes. We will never forget our moments during our 3rd Anniversary at Da Paolo Ristorante
3
Lousy food. It's like eating Italian food cooked at home. On top of that overpriced. Not worth the visit. The only good thing was the wine.
5
The ambience is quite nice, and with great food to go with, you cant find anything to criticise about.
3
The dishes are what you would expect on any italian menu and are just abaout average in taste. Wine list was decent but not exhaustive. Not a place I would re-visit.
5
Just 2 people serving 14 tables and everything ran smoothly throughout the dinner! Frankly I was impressed. And they were unfazed, and cheerful! Of course, the good was great, as usual. What can I say? I'm going back!
5
Dining in a restaurant with good food is an expectation for all diners. But, it is rare to find top notch service in an Italian restaurant. Despite the restaurant is full house indoor and outdoor, the service staffs greeted with a wide smile and ensuring our food is being served timely. Had a small chat with the service staffs, feeling warmly away from home. Worth every penny paid. Will definitely be back! Kudo to the service staffs
5
Found this cute hole-in-the-wall place on Club Str as we were looking for a late lunch.The lunch menu had enough salivating choices to make the decision prosess hard, but we landed on bolognese and ravioli. The best we've had outside Italy for years. The meal was accompanied with a glass og TerlÃ© Barbera d'Alba - a perfect recommandation.We'll definetly revisit on our next trip to Singapore
4
Booked via Chope app,received follow up call from head waiter Mr Shafi. Requested for some special arrangements as I was meeting a person for the first time. He made it special for me. I was totally delighted. Carpaccio was the best my date had trod in his lifetime as he is well travelled and have been to Italy. The pasta was also top notch. The recommended Italian Wine and tramway free tramway dessert was to die for! Chamomile tea was refillable. The best Italian in Singapore I have been to so far! My date and I had a lovely chill time at Da Paolo on the Christmas Eve. Thank you to all at Da Paolo. Buy some new dining tables that don't wobble and keep the food and service standards improving and you can be the best!

We selected the Da Paolo Ristorante in Club Street based on favorable reviews and on a Friday evening at about 7.30 our taxi driver advised that he could only drop us off close to the restaurant as Club Street is closed to traffic at that time. Bit unusual we thought but, on walking the last few meters we were suddenly in the best street party in Singapore. Warm, no rain so instead of traffic the road is closed off and the chairs and tables come out in front of the many restaurants there Great crowds, looked like the locals stop off here after work? Mixed and many, noisy and happy seemed to be the theme of the evening. We had booked at Da Paolo and decided to take up the offer of an outside table. Attention was immediate, and we were guided through the menu selection by Shaffie (the boss), and it has some interesting selections. Suitable relaxants were poured to help the process, at the same time finding that the whole party atmosphere leads to immediate communication with the surrounding patrons. The crab/tomato sauce/hint of vodka pasta was superb, partner was equally pleased with her selection, good service and added value with the complementary nibbles. Dessert was served, finishing off (me) with a little Grappa. Club Street and Da Paolo on a Friday with Shaffie and his staff is a must on our next visit to Singapore
4
Enjoyed a scrumptious meal here with family and friends on Friday evening. The area was bustling with people and we sat at an outside table to soak up the atmosphere. One slight disappointment was that despite having booked there was some confusion about where our table was to be. This was soon rectified and we all enjoyed a fabulous Italian meal
5
Between many restaurant in the busy club street, "da paolo" like to us from the first moment. We go for eat in there many time, lunch and dinner, during our holiday in Singapore. The waiter and the waitress are realy friendly, nice person! They always try to make you happy and satisfied! And We are! They have very good wine and liquor! The food is beautifull! Fresh and real italian! I think is the best you can find! I suggest to everyone like to feel at home! And want to eat for sure good!!! You can not feel bad with this people work in here! Thank you very much to all the staff! Will see you again!
5
Love the pasta dishes and carpaccio. Their concocted teas are awesome as well! Service is excellent with friendly staff. Great atmosphere for couples through family gatherings! My favorite italian diner!
4
Good portions, great pasta. Nothing exciting but that's what I wanted: real Italian food. Vegetables are great. Dessert menu needs a revamp, same desserts all over Singapore. Beautiful building, do try if you like Italian cuisine
4
This is the perfect place if you are looking for a cozy and intimate setting with great ambience for your exclusive office party (there were about 20 of us). There is also a small outdoor setting in case people need to smoke. Staff were helpful, attentive and remember what drinks each of us was having. Food was good as well. They served mini beef burgers, mushroom bruschetta, cold cuts and bocconcini with tomato. They were also very accomoodating when we prefer to have more food than drinks in our package
5
Great tasting pastas, desserts and teas. Fine collection of wines. The staff make me feel so much at home that I don't feel awkward dining there alone! I live nearby and always choose to go there amongst many other restaurants. If you want Italian food, this branch is definitely worth visiting
5
Our favourite meal in Singapore by a mile. The salad was exceptionally fresh and well seasoned. The creamed spinach pasta was mouth watering.The 4 cheese pizza was good, but I believe it is the truffle pizza that is amazing (we didn't order it although we had multiple recommendations for it).The service was very friendly and prompt - they squeezed us in despite reaching after the last order time. The wine selection was average
4
The food and atmosphere here are perfect for a casual business lunch or dinner. Quite a good selection of light to heavy type meals with several seafood, pasta and meat dishes available. Good place to also have a catch up with friends before heading to one of several drinking establishments nearby. Certainly a place I would revisit next time I am in Singapore
4
The service was good, the waiter was pleasant and spoke very good English. They sorted the tables outside so we could all sit together. Two of the ladies asked if they could have Penne arrabbiata, it wasn't on the menu but they made it for them! Reasonable prices and a large selection of wine.We did want pizza but they don't have pizza at this particular restaurant
4
Came here for supper last time I passed through Singapore - enjoyed it then and enjoyed it this time round. Just a nice simple Italian ristorante serving good quality food with a reasonably good wine list. Service was both professional and friendly. I will be back
5
da Paolo is one of my favorite lunch places in Singapore conveniently located on club street. the staff is very friendly and recognizes you on return visits.this time ordered the set menu for 28sgd with the norwegian salmon salad as a starter. the salad had some nice and tasty sauce with it. the main was marinara risotto. it tasted very fresh made with some good seafood in it. portion was just right sized. dessert was a crumble pie which i think must be also made fresh.the price is very reasonable for what you get and service speed is also good. online reservation system works very well. in fact the best i've see
4
Been to this place a few times. Its has one of the best mushroom risotto. The pasta dishes were really good. So were the thin crust pizzas. So far i have not been dissapointed. Its even better than some good restaurants in Florence. Perhaps its just the service that needs a little polishing. The prices are reasonable in my opinion
4
This is a lovely little restaurant, the staff are attentive and friendly, and the oxtail ravioli is heaven.
4
This outlet is smaller and more private than the other two. Great pasta and good service. Club St is also filled with those nice old shop lots.
4
Excellent Italian in a lively street! Try the pasta with crabmeat or the risotto.
4
For some reason, I don't like this as much as the Il Giardino location, in spite of my affection for Club Street. Maybe the chef's not as good. Will have to try it again.
4
Da Paolo's. The same, charming, food all round town. Thank god.
3
Decent Italian food
3
NIce and cozy.

Scrumptious fare in a casual classy setting but service terribly below par, particularly when compared to its local siblings..
4
I've been to a few of the De Paulo's over the years and was pleasantly surprised with my meal at this place. Mind you, the meals have always been delicious. I would usually order their pizzas which are thin crust (the way I like it) and with delicious toppings. My husband and I both ordered the fresh pasta (linguine for me) this time and were blown away with how tasty it was. I still remember how good it was and we were there three months ago. If you're in the mood for a fresh, simple (I mean that in a good way) meal, this is the place to go. We were walkins on a Friday night and they had a spot for us, so recommendations are not always needed. We had a lovely table upstairs in the quaint little shophouse. We'll def go back again when we're looking for somewhere near Club Street
5
Me and my gf went there for Sunday lunch, and we chose to sit at one of the two tables they have outside the shophouse. Very nice experience and both the lasagna I ordered and the Mushroom Risotto she orderer was fantastic, it is acutally one of the best lasagnas I've ever had!Only minus is that the dishes are quite small so I would recommend a starter
