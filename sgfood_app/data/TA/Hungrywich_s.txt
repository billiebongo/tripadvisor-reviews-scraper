Tried this sandwich outlet at Fusionopolis during lunch time today. Ordered California Veganwich @$6.5.
The buns were hard. The saving grace was that the vegetables(pepper & lettuce) are quite fresh. The taste are so-so.

The team at hungrywichs does at an amazing job in preparing the food and also in serving it. Multiple very tasty items on the menu. If you are on a diet you can choose some lighter versions. Strongly recommend and it's a certainty that I will return or order for delivery

Everything is nice! Love the black pepper sandwich and Cajun Roast Beef Sandwich. The black pepper sandwich is truly peppery hot!. Cajun beef is spicy! Love it. The freshly baked bread is also soft each time I go there to eat. The muffins are decent size for $2+ muffin compared to other muffins elsewhere. Lovely flavours : green tea, chocolate, etc. I will always buy a range of coloured muffins back for the family. The orange zest cake is excellent. One can taste the real orange in it!A must try is the hot chocolate. Real "chocolaty"!!!Overall, a must visit cafe if you are at One North area! Cosy and bright decor and good food. Plus good service. What more can one ask for
