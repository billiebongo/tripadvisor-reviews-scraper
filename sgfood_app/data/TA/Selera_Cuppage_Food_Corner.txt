We've always come back here for the beef claypot rice and fried baby squid! Can't get it better at other place. Location is good, but packed during lunch and weekends. Helpful and quick service. Always looking forward to go here on any occasions ;)

Food was not bad with reasonable price.
The iced tea was one of the good ones which you could find in Singapore.
Worth a try

This is a pretty standard place for most of my office to grab lunch quick and cheap. It's also my go-to place for fried rice, which is one of my main irresistible cheat foods. Was just there today and maybe again tomorrow!Look, it's not fancy, the service is, um, "efficient", but for quick, tasty fried rice or other selections this is a great place, especially for tourists looking for a Singaporean lunch experience

I was impressed with the freshness and passion of the kitchen. I had a Thai Nasee Goreng followed by Indian Prata with banana and curry sauce. Really very good! I can't rate this place higher than I did because plastic wipes down chairs and tables mean you are dining at a certain budget and the ambience is typical of street foo

This is a gem in Orchard Road for local cooked food at reasonable price. You can pack or eat in. Best thing is that it is halal. Try the Salted fish chicken claypot rice or Indian mee goreng. The food is piping hot in a casual relaxed atmosphere
