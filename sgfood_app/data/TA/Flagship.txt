Large list of whiskies, great for the uninitiated. Service, as with your other ventures, is warm and friendly. Very decent place indeed, will be back.

Drinks are good. We (4pax) had a punchbowl which the menu claims to be for 15-20pax, but that would work only if each person only has one small cup. Otherwise the drink was delicious. They also have an extensive list of whiskies and their standard pour is a generous 45ml.Food is bar food style meant for sharing, but unlike most bars which just try to serve some sort of barely edible food so you don't get drunk too fast, the food here is really yummy and of good quality. Flagship doesn't have their own kitchen, the food comes from Humpback their sister restaurant next door, and Humpback food never disappoints. Size of venue is just nice and there's a good ratio of staff to customers. They were very friendly, plus super attentive always keeping our water topped up and clearing empty dishes promptly. Reservations recommended since it fills up fast.Music selection is great, very varied, and not so loud as to inhibit conversation.Definitely now on my list of go-to venues for chillout+dinner.
