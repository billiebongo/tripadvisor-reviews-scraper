A funky dinner place at the shophouses. The food was generous and there is a variety crafted beers. Nice place to chill....

Family and I were blown over by the pastas that we had. They were exceptionally delicious! For less than $20 per plate, they were extremely value for money too.

Burger portions were huge. We prefer the burger with soft shell crabs. Coconut milkshake was to die for! :)

I was there last Saturday for a birthday celebration and we had a good time. The food was tasty especially the salted egg fried with poached egg. It was a cried favorite. Overall the food was also value for money. Well worth a visit.

We came back for more of the goodies we tried on our first visit. They just revamped their menu the day before - fish fingers and crab cakes are no longer on the menu. Not disappointed with new items but would be good if they bring back the crab cakes

We've been to Old boy's twice now, once for lunch and once for dinner. Both times the service was friendly and prompt. All the food ordered on those 2 occasions was cooked to perfection - from the must-try salted egg chicken wings and crab cakes to the burger BUT each time the food took SO long to arrive!During the dinner that was forgivable since we were not in a hurry but during our work lunch the mains came before the starters and by the time our group finished their mains the starters had not yet arrived and hence had to be cancelled since we couldn't wait all day
