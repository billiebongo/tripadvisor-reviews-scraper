It’s quite amazing on how a restaurant can get the food so good and the service so bad!
Go spend you’re money in AlForno!

Excellent pizza if you're craving for authentic Italian pizzas. The crust is done well (just right... not too thick or thin), and the toppings are generous. The pricing is also reasonable for the quality of food served.

Easy going dining joint for consistent pizzas from Les Amis. Reservations highly recommended as weekends are busy

This is the place I order my pizzas from. There is a wind range of pizzas, and other foods. Worth visiting, with a clean, nice restruant, and also delivery. Also, the staff are nice.

The pizza is well worth the money! Thin crusted without too much of it being burnt, flavourful and highly satisfying! Definitely worth the money at 12" for 2!

Family came here for pizza lunch and was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the pizzas and salads....we had the Suprema and Hawaiian pizzas with a grilled chicken salad. I really enjoyed the pint of Hoegaarden draft beer! The kids enjoyed the kid's meal with pizza, drink, and gelato.Overall, great tasting pizzas, service, and decent prices. I would recommend as family friendly place and will definitely come back soon

The pizzeria is tucked in a cosy Neighbourhood near the beach. The main pizza making action is in the main dining area and it smells amazing when the oven is fired up. Pizza smelt so good everyone couldn't wait for me to take a picture. But yes! The pizza's crust is thin and crispy and it tasted amazingly delicious!

If you are looking for a decent Italian meal with the family - I'd recommend Peperoni anytime! Our picky 8 year-old absolutely loves their carbonara! The bacon bits are just absolutely heavenly! And the extra large pizzas are great for big family occasions - and you can order 2 separate items for the same XL pizza if you can't decide on which flavour to go for. If you have extra space in your belly or just feeling gluttony like we do, order the Funghi Portobello con Pollo, you can thank me later.
