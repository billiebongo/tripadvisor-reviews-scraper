Booked this place for my brother's birthday and all 5 of us enjoyed all our food and drink orders. The place is beautiful and cosy, the music was classy, and the service was attentive. But the food really is the highlight. It was really good.

Drop by to this cafe to have brunch. I had eggs benedicts and sirlion steak (tennesse sauce) with grill vegetables. The sauce was delicious and sirlion steak cooked perfectly. Overall, nice atmosphere, great food and superb service. Will recommend my friends!

Perfect place for small group. Retro feel with a handful of selection of mains. Would try the desserts next time

We had the soup of the day (carrot puree), squid ink aglio olio, rosemary chicken with waffle fries and mocha latte. I enjoyed the carrot puree with garlic bread the most. Overall a pleasant experience with attentive service.

I finally have the time to actually compliment & Why amidst my busy schedule! & Why has been nothing short of amazing! The service and food was tiptop I booked a table via Chope and made a request to surprise the birthday boy with a cake! Upon reaching I was attended by Tisay, I handed over an envelope of a request as Chope doesn't allow me to write more than the maximum characters, hence I wrote a letter to make sure everything goes according to plan and Tisay helped out flawlessly. She did however mentioned that at the point of time, there was no cakes available in house but it was replaced with a dessert instead, and it was good nonetheless! I had the Rosemary Chicken, and the birthday boy had the Crab Meat Pasta, all in all it was a great experience and the service catered was beyond expected. Thank you Tisay, Sufi and the lovely girl in the hijab for helping out with the surprise! Would definitely patron & Why again

Tuck in a quiet Bali lane in the Arab st area, you have a restaurant specializing in halal American steaks. Good choices of sauces to select too. Salted egg calamari was superRibeye was 4starPotato dishes and salad was good. Overall presentation was very good. Reasonably priced. Service can be a little slow but all orders arrived ok. Worth the visit if you are in the area.

Stumbled upon this place on accident while looking around. I love the ambience here, not too bright and the music wasnâ€™t too loud such that I had to raise my voice to talk. The food was also delightful and perfectly portioned. Staff were very polite, friendly and helpful. Overall an extremely pleasant experience

This was my second visit to &why. Food was good as usual; i had the prawn tacos while my friend had the ultimate breakfast. However the male waiter could improve on his service. I asked for a small plate and he passed me one with an ant crawling on it. He simply flicked it away and wanted me to take the plate, until i told him to give me another plate.

Reserved seats, however there were no seats for us in the shop, so they suggested to us that we sit outside instead. But my friends and I wanted an air conditioned environment due to the warm weather. so we waited outside, until there's seats for us. after waiting, we managed to get a seat inside. really like the ambience of the cafe. and the food was one of the best I've eaten, compared to other halal cafes. thought it's slightly pricier than other halal cafes, I think it's worth it since the food is good. it was nice of the waiter to ask us how was our experience too. it felt like they value their customers' feedbacks and I really appreciate that. would come here again!

Nice place to hang out with friends! Cosy and yet a hipster place! loved it! Went with a group of 8 friends and spent over 3 hrs chatting over their food and drinks. Their mock tails n starters are great to start with!

Staff were very attentive and food was served quickly. The cafe has an interesting selection of coffee. The menu has been revamped since the last time we came. Price is affordable and very value for money. We will definitely be back very soon.

What a beautifully delicious breakfast. Just round the corner from our hotel Park Royal. Stumbled across it whilst looking for a late breakfast. Had a nice alternate restaurant vibe. Polite friendly staff, quality of the produce was amazing. Lots of thought about how all the flavour is balanced, poached eggs were perfect. Totally coming back for another breakfast & dinner during our stay in Singapore.

I love the place, the ambience and the whole setup. The staffs are friendly too. The food is not superb, but of course it's my first time, so I may not be 100% sure of the entire menu. My friends and I had the Avocado salad, salted egg calamari, parmesan & truffle fries and sirloin steak. The calamari can be better if it's not half soggy. The sirloin steak has beef bacon strips and sweet potato fries. While the sauce and fries are good, I think the beef bacon needs to tone down on the salt. We find it a bit salty. The perfect one is of course the parmesan & truffle fries! Love this one! We also tried 2 mocktails and a caffe latte. The mocktails are really good! We had the Raspberry Kisses and Full Passion.I may go back there again to try others on the menu

We went there twice the same day. First, two of us had their fruit mocktails, which were very refreshing and tasted great, particularly the passionfruit one. 4 of us later came back to try the food. The shrimp tacos were great, as was the beef, the salads and the portobello sandwich. The food you can order is definitely unusual, and very tasty. Price-wise, it is a bit steep, but that is because of the location, and you do get great quality. The service staff is very friendly and efficient. We'll definitely return next time we're in Arab street

Was looking for a typical nasi lemak but could not find a good one..alas stumbled into "& Why" @Haji Lane and decided to give it a go. Was not a bad decision. Had steak and it was quite good..just that the sauce is a tad salty ..but to be fair I do not take salt as much. Overall am happy with it. Friendly service..cosy ambience.. Will come again.. coffee is not too bad either. And for those seeking a western halal cafe , this is one to consider

It was a Friday evening and we did not make a reservation. So indeed, we were thankful that we were able to secure a table; though it was outdoors. Soon, the heat became unbearable and we asked if we could sit inside instead. Thankfully, a table was vacated and we found ourselves in a cooler environment.My partner was persuaded to try the day's special, the herb Cuban lobster. We were also told the portion was small as it was a one-off food item. No matter, for my partner found it tasty but unfulfilling because of its portion size. Thankfully, we shared the buffalo wings, which turned out to be rather spicy; at least for me. I ordered the grilled chicken, which was served with potatoes and laced with mushroom sauce.What gave this establishment my star rating is the service rendered, particularly the service recovery. It took a long while before the buffalo wings were served. As we wondered and contemplated cancelling the order, a team member approached us to explain the reason behind the delay (apparently he had rejected the dish the first time as it was not up to his expectation). It was served subsequently and he also made it a point to inquire thereafter on our satisfaction level. He was chatty but yet knew when to accord us privacy. As an icing to the cake, the charge was waived off out of goodwill. Thank you
