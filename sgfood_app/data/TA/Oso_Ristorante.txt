Have been dining at Oso for many years and the food and service at the new location is as good as ever.
5
Dined at OSO last night for the Valentines evening as we have done for the past 10 years. The restaurant never fails to deliver with a wonderfully imaginative and delicious set menu and excellent wine list in stylish surroundings. Quality and attention to detail is why OSO has been around for ever. Has the feel of a top European restaurant and should be in the top ten on tripadvisor restaurants in Singapore

My partner and I had our dinner at Oso Ristorante, 27th Floor, Oasia Downtown Hotel. I enjoyed the ambience. We were treated to live saxophone. The food we ordered was yummy delicious. The dessert tiramisu was great. I enjoyed the coffee very much too. We had a great time enjoying the ambience, and mostly the food.And yes, I will be bringing other friends and family to this restaurant.Ms Nancy Ye

It was a nightmarish experience for me! I had booked the restaurant more than half a month ago through a 3rd party booking app called Chope. I had a shock on the actual day when I called to change my dinner timing! The lady who answered my call could not find my reservation despite my confirmation from Chope. And it did not help when her English was not proficient as I had to spell my name 5 times for her. In the end, the restaurant had wanted to arrange an outdoor seating when I had previously requested for an indoor seating when I reserved through Chope. I also had a rude shock when the staff asked me to leave by 830pm as there was supposed to be 2 seatings. This was not even clearly reflected when I booked the restaurant under Chope! It had left a sour taste in my mouth!!

Going to Oso over the years, always a pleasure!In a nutshell:- Great food, flavors and colors but all in simplicity; real typical Italian not like so many others who do not even know where to place Italy on the map!- Same excellent staff for the last 10 years! where else do you see that in Singapore!!!!- Among the very best wine list in Singapore for Italian Wines; clearly these people do not source their wines from the same few big distributors who are reselling to most lazy restaurants. they do know how and where to find little gems!- Affordable prices- great for Couples, friends and BizThey recently moved to the top floor of Oasia hotel, where they took the opportunity to present a new great Deco along with a new additional (on top of the old one) menu!Pleasure garanteed

This restaurant has a beautiful interior design which welcomes you and makes you feel comfortable. The menu is well set with the Italian classic dishes and wide range of meats. We ordered ala carte appetiser, and Black Ink Rissoto and US Duck for main. The food was so delicious that we shared each other’s mains. This restaurant is perfect to visit for any occasion.

First time at Oso. Ambience and location are good. Service was very good; the waiter immediately added burgundy wine glasses when we requested to open and drink a burgundy bottle which we brought. Shows he knows how wines should be served. I had the slow cooked lamb which was slow cooked for eight hours; it was charred on the outside which is not supposed to be. This is the reason I am only awarding 3 rating to the visit. Starters which were shared among eight of us were not too bad
4
We went for our New Year’s dinner (not eve). The decor is beautiful - situated on the 27th floor beside a Swimming pool, the ambiance is quite nice and the service attentive.Food wise - all dishes are strong on flavour and your rating will depend on how heavy and strong you prefer flavours to play a role in your food.Their squid ink risotto was great, but you need to have it hot-hot-hot, cause it’s gets a bit salty once it cools down. The lobster fettuccine was greatly loved by my wife, but I found an over abundance of tomato sauce (even though the sauce was fresh and the pasta handmade).As secondi, we had the octopus in potato mash - again uniformly delicious, but I have to say I was majorly disappointed with the portion size of this dish - for $45, I expected more than one flimsy tentacle.Revisit likelihood - yes, there are some interesting dishes that we haven’t tried yet, so I will be back here

We chose Oso from a number of our favourite restaurants specifically because we had both chosen dishes from the a la carte menu. There was no mention on the website about a special NYE menu. We received an email confirmation of our booking time 8pm which explained we would get a phone call to confirm. There was no phone call and when I called the restaurant, we were told our time was 8.30pm. I changed it to 8pm.When we arrived in the restaurant, it was freezing cold. The owner very kindly noticed my discomfort and changed the temperature. However, we were surprised to see there was a set menu, not what we had wanted at all but we realised that finding another restaurant at this late hour wasn't going to be easy. The staff tried hard to accommodate us by changing the main course to what we had originally wanted. We ordered some wine. The starter arrived before our drinks and I asked what the side dishes were for, thinking there may be some bread. The waiter then brought us some bread. The courses then came in rapid succession and were not really to our taste. By the time the dessert arrived, the restaurant had become uncomfortably cold again. I was very disappointed when the waiter drizzled some chocolate sauce on our otherwise tasteless dessert, only to take the pot away!! Oso used to be a favourite restaurant of ours but unfortunately this special evening did not live up to expectations and we won't be returning

I have been to Oso since they started. My kids used to go with us and they are now all adults and we still go back! The ambiance at new Oso is beautiful. Persian rug at entrance with generous amount of chandeliers everywhere. Love the private room. Just very glamarous and captivating! Food is the same, consistency. And the duo Diego and Stephan are always very welcoming!
5
for all food lover , a must try place.Loved the ambiance ,cleanliness,food quality and their presentation

We were staying at the Oasia Downtown so decided to try the surprise 3 course lunch menu for $33. The decor is beautiful and the service staff excellent but the food ?? The bread that they bring out is absolutely nothing like you receive in Italy and all three courses were nothing that we have ever encountered dining in any italian restaurant. We have been to Italy, Sicily and Malta on four occasions and this food is pathetic. Sorry people who have rated this restaurant highly where have you been ?
5
Debated going here based on some mixed reviews, but we’re happy we did. The location on the 27th floor of the Oasia Hotel is cool / unique. We found the restaurant interior stunning and eclectic. We shared an avocado salad to start, it was pretty unique (looked like a whole, unpeeled avocado, but it was actually peeled and covered in black sesame seeds). One entree was so-so (pasta with wild boar ragu), but the other two were exceptional (rigatoni with sausage and risotto with black truffles). The menu is pretty extensive with what looked to be some nice (and pricey) steak options. Their cheese room was super cool too. The focaccia bread was also delicious and we enjoyed ice cream and sorbet for dessert.
2
This restaurant thrives on its long standing “higher end” Singapore dining existence - it’s hard to fathom really. Its very ordinary Italian food and there are much better Italian places to spend your cash on in Singapore. All 3 dishes I tasted were either unseasoned or just rather dull. Even the bread served seemed stale ( and was not baked the same day). The setting and service was fine and the wine list is extensive with prices to match
5
Full of natural lighting and glass panels with a swimming pool that’s part of the Oasia Hotel at the entrance. The managers and waiters are friendly and it’s a great place to lunch or dine.The X’mas lunch promotion is a steal at $48 and it’s great value for good quality 4 courses. The sea bass carpaccio is super delicious. The fetucinne with turkey and black truffle ragout is unbelievably tasty. The main is beef cheeks braised in red wine with chestnut and corn polenta. The dessert of mascarpone n amaretto mousse with hot chocolate sauce simply completes the perfect meal! I will definitely go back for more!
2
Disappointing describes this experience. The service was actually very good and I like the decor apart from the fact that the restaurant shares it's space with the hotel swimming pool where you can see guests swimming which is slightly bizarre.The food was the most disappointing part of the experience. We went for the 5 course menu and were both surprised to not get any fish/meat for the first two courses which were both heavy on sauces rather than appetising and not especially tasty. The next two were no better and the dessert was unedible.I expected more
5
We stayed at the hotel and got to Oso just in time for lunch. Loved the food and very happy to meet a good Norwegian waiter too! Highly recommended and next time in Singapore I will for sure manage to have dinner here since it was just lunch this tim
5
Wandering around my Oasia Hotel to explore their cool facilities. On 27th patio or open air floor do they have this restaurant. Am always sceptic to hotel establishment however place looked cool. A warm welcome for the staff made me curious, Stephane greeted me and explained its an independent restaurant. Stood next to their glass cabinet with cheese. Sents
5
revisited OSO's new location at Oasia hotel downtown. retained their charms from old location and added new chic touches to the decor, setting and service outstanding. glad to see the classics and new dishes - orecchiette pasta with prawns and the dry-aged tomahawk is perfectly done. my 2 thumbs up.definitely a good restaurant to dine with like-minded friends out for a good time
5
The whole wheat pasta with wild boar ragu in a red wine sauce may be the best pasta dish I have ever eaten. My wife thoroughly enjoyed a veal-filled ravioli in a cream sauce. When a tour brought us back to the city a week later, we came back
5
I was shattered to see after a recent visit to Singapore that Oso is closed :-(
The building is 'for rent'.. however there is a lovely looking Japanese one in the downstairs area that I am yet to try.. but will on my next visit!
5
The change of location has not reduced either the excellent service or the quality of food. We loved the new restaurant, and enjoyed a wonderful Friday evening with friends last week.
You will need to book in advance as it was very busy.
5
Visited the restaurant with a $200 Uniqgift voucher for a surprise 4 course meal with wine pairing. Food was delicious and service was top notch!
5
Nicely allowed for a 12 person team dinner to take place allowing the 2 teams to get to know each other. The wine, food and discussions were top class...
5
I like this place! on the top of the OAsia Downtown hotel. Strong italian influenced restaurant. Knowledgeable staff, obviously a great chef and great team. Odd entrance as you have to circumnavigate the swimming-pool(s). Good menu (try the fois-gras) and a very nice selection of wines. Service is timely but not too fast or sl slow you rush out and get an in-between-burger :) Unfortunately I had engagements on the other evenings otherwise I would have returned at least twice more. If you're in the area book a table at OSO and indulge uorselves

1. Restaurant is certainly quite grand and pretty2. I love love the wine glasses used plus the tealights are lovely.3. Wine is expensive but really goodThat's really all. The rest - given the price tag- is really mediocre. - had five-course surprise menu. Quality is good but nothing that blows me away. V small portions - service is very average. No one is rude but no one went out of their way to make u feel at home. Waiters mumbled explanations of their food.- super loud music- not good for conversation It is nice to visit Oso if you just have extra cash, want a nice looking place and an ok dining experience. For the amount spent, better off visiting other restaurants that pay more attention to interesting food plus service
4
We had a lovely meal here the other night We both opted for the 8 course tasting menu which was very well presented by fantastic staff ( the chef even joined us briefly describing his creations) . Also OSO has a great wine cellar. The only downside to the meal was the fact that at least 4 of the courses contained mushrooms, I like mushrooms but come on guys 4 courses really???? One course would of been enough . I would of given you 5 stars if not for the avalanche of mushrooms . Mushrooms aside This is still a lovely restaurant especially if your a fungi lover!!!!
3
We had a few starters- nothing specialFor the mains.the pasta noodles were good. just the crab and the sauce not up to expectation.the seabass average.saving grace was the dessert.tiramisu and vanilla parfait were excellent.maybe my expectations were raised before dining.restauarant ambience and service staff were good. The GM walks around table to table checking in with diners
5
There on a weekday to celebrate Dec birthdays for three of my children. Restaurant were packed with business diners. Shown a table in front of the bar counter. Asked for a cosy corner for birthday dinner. Staff checked reservation & quickly change table for us. Been to restaurant many times when they were in Bukit Pasoh. Like this new place better - ambience & not so noisy with its high ceiling. Shifted here only two months ago. Four of us ordered Ala Carte & two ordered the Chef’s Suprise Menu. We liked the Chef Selection Cold Cuts, Ciopinno, Risotto nero, Capello d’Angelo & especially the Filleto tenderloin (always done to perfection) - a must have during every visit. The individual portion for the 5-course set is just right & filling enough for the ladies. The prices are very reasonable considering service, ambience & food. Will be back soon for business dining again
5
We visited OSO for the first time since they moved to the Oasia hotel and were not disappointed. The food, service, wine and setting all remain excellent. There was even a Sax player to entertain without being intrusive to conversation. The pork belly was immense as always, as was the burrata to start. Can't fault this place at all. Oh and there is a cheese room for those who love a bit of the smelly stuff
5
Diego, the chef, pays a special attention to sourcing and product quality. Result is impressive. Not cheap, for sure.
3
Nice place and food is good. Set lunch portion is too small. Even after 3 courses, still feel hungry. May be better to go for ala carte menu
5
Beautiful restaurant. Great service. Check out the cheese room. Food is superb great. Try the duck and the pastas. Rissotto is also nice.
4
Pasta was excellent as was the location and service. We ordered a bistecca and it was fine— not great. Overall good but expensive for value
5
I'd always like OSO even when it was still at its previous location. Now moving to Oasia Hotel, the interior decoration is even more impressive and spacious. The full team of staff is still there, with their friendly smile. Food is as good as ever.
5
Oso is a hidden gem amongst the top restaurants in Singapore. The food is absolutely outstanding in terms of taste and presentation. As you would expect - a carefully thought through menu of classic Italian food that is paired with outstanding combinations of flavors. Not only is the food excellent, but so is the service. The restaurant manager, waiters and chef understand the basic fundamentals of putting the customer first. Genuine conversation where they are clearly interested in their guests and making sure they have an unforgettable dining experience. If you are looking for an elegant dining location, then Oso is the place.I will return to Oso often - Highly recommended
4
This was my 1st time @ Oso Ristorante. Ordered a 3-course set lunch based on "special chef menu". We were served with freshly baked bread & the special set lunch was good. Presentation is impressive. I think the portion can be abit more generous. Anyway the ambience was pretty cosy, it should be even better in the evening.
5
We stumbled into the restaurant since we are staying at the hotel and did not want to bother going into town after a 13 hours flight. Everything was a pleasant surprise.I highly recommend the five course dinner. Every dish was introduced to us very professionally and with a heart for personal service and good food.They have Italian cheeses of high quality. What a night!I will be back!
5
My team got taken here to celebrate the end of a big conference, and having just returned from my honeymoon in Florence I was sceptical at how a Singaporean restaurant could really capture classic Italian cooking. Turns out I was wrong.This place was extraordinary - with absolutely DELICIOUS, stunning food. Highly recommend it - I felt as if I was back in Florence for the night. Yum.
5
The Oasia Hotel recently won an architectural award as best building in Asia, and this restaurant follows suit. Surrounded on two sides by swimming pools and elegant grill-like canopies, Oso Restaurant is like a traditional European bistro transported into a beautiful, interesting future. We had a superb light lunch, excellently served.Highly recommende
5
I went for a business lunch, and the meal was fantastic. The service was attentive and proper. The menu was complete and with many Italian special creations, and the wine list was very nice. This restaurant is fine dining.
5
Was impressed with everything the moment i got there. warmly greeted at the door,blown away by the decors and sold by the service and foood!will be back for more of this plc for sure!

We were here for our wedding anniversary, my wife's surprise. The food is awful. We had starters: my wife antipasti (Good) and I carpaccio (awful). The carpaccio was thickly sliced beef with cheddar on it. The beef was stringy and inedible. I sent it back. For mains my wife had steak (expensive but good) while I had the angle hair with crab. The pasta was overcooked and bland, the sort of thing I used to prepare for my kids who had objections to any herb, including pepper. In short, terrible. Unappetizing crap
5
Loved the old OSO location , and was a bit hesitant about move to the new location But the same great team and wonderful food experience in a new atmosphere made this a fantastic evening with friends . Can only be recommended for couples , corporate or group of friends
5
-Restaurant is beautifully decorated with natural sunlight in the daytime.-Chef is very friendly & service staff are attentive -It was my 1st time there for lunch, we had the surprise lunchtime menu which was $33++ for 3 course. Reasonably priced for the quality of the food, although the portions were not big, but sufficient for lunch. -Lovely place for great food & wine-Book in advance as the restaurant is not very big.
5
We were a bit hesitant as they have just moved recently into new premises on top of a 27 story building compared to the previous low rise setting in Chinatown. We were pleasantly surprised. Food was exquisite, great service in a completely new environment which was equally as pleasant as previously. Pity they haven't been able to take advantage of the views but no big deal anyway. We will keep coming back as this is one of the best Restaurants in Singapore. Highly recommend the squid ink risotto, cold cut platter also. Staff are fantastic,as is the chef who was mixing with his customers for feedback . Don't see enough of that these days

Saturday 16th Sept 20176pm family dinner for 4I have been following OSO from 27 Tg Pagar Rd, to 44 Bukit Pasoh and now, 100 Peck Seah Street sitting on top of Oasia Hotel Downtown. Stephane & Diego are “Masters-At-Work”. They have managed to maintain the food & service quality at it’s best at all times. I’ve known the restaurant for nearly 12 years and I must say that they deliver; in good times and also, bad times. The new outlet is a 3-min walk from Tg Pagar MRT station and a cool 15-sec fast lift to the 27th floor from the lobby of Oasia Hotel Downtown. On top, you are greeted by the hotel’s rooftop pool where hotel guests lounge & swim. The pool sets an easy ambience upon arrival. Once inside, the old lush of OSO is now blended with a modern twist of industrialist design; such a fresh new look. Complimented with the many designer bulbs, the space has high ceiling and now looks the brand new OSO. Oh, they have changed their logo too…*Note: Do not expect any views from the rooftop. As privacy for guests, the roof perimeter has been covered.The cheese room is now on it’s own while the cured meat station is around the bar. They have 2 private areas to dine; one is in the wine cellar. Though the private areas do not have totally enclosed walls, they have thick curtains to close off the area.ON THE TABLEWine glasses should not be used for iced water. Besides sweating the glass with droplets, it must be straight up. It’s a different experience drinking plain water. The focaccia & bread sticks have the same taste just like 10 years ago, if not better. The bottled olive oil at the side is so addictive. The previous servings come with balsamic vinegar, but this time, it’s not accompanied with. Please ask for some.Aglio-olio pasta for my kids are good & they enjoyed it. Avocado salad is fresh but rather plain. We had crab pasta with spicy sauce & they were good. There is not much taste variety in it but the distinct taste was really good. A staff appeared candidly with a mini parmigiano brick to grate fresh cheese over my pasta. Why not…DESSERT (This is biased. I cannot control my indulgence!)We had ice-cream for the kids, Crostata & Tiramisu.Tiramisu tastes flawless with a good creamy texture. The hint of alcohol is rather strong in the nose but does not reflect the strong taste of it. Good job! My favourite, the Crostata. Round pastry cup filled with dark chocolate heated to a good temperature, topped with a scoop of your favourite ice-cream. Best of both worlds! Better than Starbuck’s Brownie with ice-cream. Period. Oh wait, that one’s good too. OSO always keep its staff for the long-term. I loved every one of their staff for enhancing my dining experience. Somehow they knew what taste I come with every time. Their knowledge gives me confidence that yes, they know their products well.There are plots of seats for guests available outside the restaurant, though I’m not sure if you can dine there. There is also a secluded smoking area to maximize your experience, haha! Lastly, I totally welcome this new change. It brings out a fresh new feel & dining experience. Even their new in-house music selection is good.“The same authentic OSO taste & good service in a brand new environment.”Thank you OSO for a truly enjoyable experience all these years. I will be back

Oso was always a staple of my husband and I's. The food was always incredible and service very good for Singapore. We went for the opening night at their new location and have to say, were incredibly disappointed especially because we took some friends for a special occasion. The new location on top of Oasia is extremely underwhelming. Gone is the neighbourhood charm of the old. You would at least expect on a rooftop in Singapore to have a view, but no, the building is completely enclosed and you are adjacent to two guest swimming pools up there. So you have to walk across a pool deck to get in, then you are in a bricked in room with no view in sight. There is also no longer the option to dine al fresco which we always quite enjoyed at the previous location. The food was still very good, although I was disappointed my favourite (the gnocci) is no longer on the menu. But the service was abysmal! Several people in our group ordered various tasting menus. First off, there was about 45 minutes between courses which is absolutely too long for a tasting menu. Second, they messed up and gave some of the wrong people the wrong part of the tasting menu. Once they realised the mistake they compensated by bringing out just soup for the people that had the 7 course even though they had served a prawn and chorizo dish to the people with a 5 piece menu - so those with the more involved courses actually totally missed out on what the 5 piece course people said was the best item! Also, one of the courses for the 7 course was a sorbet palette cleanser...since when is the palette cleanser considered a course?! Definitely not worth the extra and most restaurants include this as standard before the main comes out. When we complained they just shrugged and said it was their first day there. No excuse for a well established restaurant, the servers and kitchen staff still should now how to serve, or at least compensate terrible service. Needless to say we are sad to know that we won't be going back. It is like we lost our favourite 'celebration' restaurant in Singapore
5
It was a pleasure to be back in Oso our all-time favorite in Singapore. Quality and Service first class as always. I wish we would have at least 1 Italian Restaurant of this level in Cape Town. All the best to the team at the new location
5
In my opinion Oso is the best restaurant in town. The food is consistently fresh, delicious and balanced to perfection. The service is impeccable. It is a place where "everybody knows your name" and they know your taste and they will go out of the way to make you feel welcome and happy. We have been going there for years and Chef Diego always finds a way to surprise us with a dish that tastes extraordinary. Stephane will always have the best suggestion for a great wine. The waiters always have a discreet approach and pleasant manner that makes everyone feel comfortable. It is an amazing experience each time.
5
Nice place with European cuisine. Polite are people and delicious courses were served, especially the ice-cream.
5
Excellent service, nice ambience and great food. My bestfriend and i had a wonderful evening. Highly recommended.
5
Wonderful service, great food, lovely ambience. Good selection of wine. Impressive! Will be back! ❤️❤️❤️
5
I have been coming to Oso's for some years now, and each and every time i fall in love again. The ambience and level of service and high quality of food and a wine cellar that also opens for non-italian wines (thank you. . .a Chateauneuf du Pape goes very well with Italian cousine) is a real treat. I bow my head in stating that the truffle risotto - served al dente - is probably the best truffle risotto i have ever tried. . . served in a portion size that does not kill your tastebuds for the rest of the meal, and yet forces you to come again soon to try it again. . .This is ideal venue for romantic evenings out, or a client event. my warmest recommendation.p.s. Oso is moving the one of the hotels this week. . . i cant wait to visit them when i am next in Singapor
5
I love Oso! Authentic Italian cuisine located a 10 minute walk from Chinatown.I have had the pleasure of Oso several times and have never been disappointed! Opened a few years ago by Stephane Colleoni and chef Diego Chiarini, together they have mastered a fine dining italian experience. Both Stephane and Diego will come and greet you if they are there, they are wonderful! If you have any special request they will do their absolute best to be sure they make it for you. Mine is truffles on everything... all year round, and they have never let me down.Yes, I love Oso, and highly recommend it for small intimate dinners and or business dining

We were a party of 4. 2 of us had the National Day special which was priced at $52. The other 2 friends ordered ala carte. The food quality is consistently good and never fails to impress us with delicious, imaginative and creative dishes. I understand they will be moving to a new location where the rental will be much lower. I'm happy to hear that. In this day and age, tenants are always at the mercy of the landlords who charge exhorbitant rentals. And as a result, restaurants find it difficult to survive and often food prices have to be raised to the point where it becomes unaffordable. I'm looking forward to visiting them at their new premise
5
An impromptu day off lunch treat at our absolute favourite place in Singapore. Tremendous value set lunch which is delicious too. We added in the gnocchi from the a la carte menu because we'd had them before and loved them! Service, food all excellent as always and we look forward to visiting their new location in a month.
3
Went there for lunch with a friend. First, the food was quite OK. Not spectacular, but generally OK. Cold meat platter for sharing, wild boar pasta and tiramisu. Definitely not the best we've had in Singapore, but still not bad either. Second, the staff were friendly but behaved a bit weird and were impossible to understand. We had three men coming to the table over lunch and we couldn't understand most of what they said. Weird. Third, and this is the most negative point, we were continuously bothered with moths and other insects that kept circling over our food and drinks. We killed some of them, but they just kept coming. Very unacceptable for this kind of restaurant. It really disturbs the atmosphere and makes you feel that there is not enough hygiene and so forth. So they've got work to do. There's many better places for lunch in the streets just around it
4
I went for dinner there as part of a corporate event for 20 pax. The restaurant has a lovely private room, which comes with a small lounge and even its own private toilet, furnished lavishly!Service was fantastic- Cali the guest relations manager was extremely helpful and prompt in answering our queries by email, and Mr Ramlan our server was tireless in attending to our every need.The food was good and there is a good selection of affordable italian wines to pair with. Will definitely go there again

Visited this restaurant during lunchtime on a weekend. The restaurant was empty save for a group of people at one other table. I ordered the set lunch which came with a mozarella cheese salad, potato and leek soup and a choice of main and dessert. Went with the barramundi for the main and 70% dark chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream. The salad was alright with acceptable portion, and the soup was good with truffle oil on top. However, the fish was quite disappointing, soft and lacked flavour. The dessert was also unremarkable. My partner ordered from the ala carte menu; pasta with pork marinated in red wine sauce. The sauce was too sour, which spoilt the taste of the dish. Service was amicable but a bit on the slow side
4
Reliably, predictably good discreet service and consistently excellent food in a pleasant setting. A return-to place.
5
Love their gluten free pasta .. they even have gluten free bread ... they serve very good steak as well !
5
Oso is a place we keep coming back to. Their service is unique in Singapore, they really know how to take care of you. It obviously helps that the food is excellent as well. Pasta's are great, and so is the steak.
4
Came here for the set lunch last week with some friends. This consisted of 4 courses (a salad, a soup, a main and a dessert) for a price of $40++. Bread and iced water were provided without additional cost. Decent food and efficient service. Quality is consistent with what I recall from my last visit several years ago
5
A huge thank you to you and your team for making my company’s event such a huge success! It was a pleasant experience working with your team and my team is more than pleased that everything went so smoothly. We greatly appreciate your team’s efforts in meeting our requests

My partner and I were intending to dine at the Japanese restaurant downstairs but they were closed. It was 10.30pm. So I went upstairs to try my luck and a very nice waitress agreed to seat us after slight hesitation.Turns out it was a blessing in disguise! We had stumbled upon an Italian restaurant that's reasonably priced and authentic. We ordered a burrata to share, two pasta dishes and a glass of wine each (the Shiraz by the glass tasted great btw). Very pleased by the food, wine and service. Will definitely come back (earlier this time) to try out their cheeses as well
5
We had a company event at OSO’s Private dining room and it was carefully planned to suit our needs. We really love the menu prepared for us and the staff was attentive towards us. We appreciate the efforts and my colleagues and I decided to write some reviews about the event
5
Invited by a friend to this restaurant, the overall services is very good with very nice ambient.As my friend is a regular of the restaurant, the chef came to take our manual personally a recommended a four courses dinner, Started with pork head pudding, black truffles angel hair, wagu beef and cheese platters to end the dinner.The entire menu was well prepared and excellent wine paring, and I would definitely revisit next time I travel to Singapore
5
Even though Chope had lost our reservation the staff found us an indoor table at short notice. Not sure what to order, the bar tender came up with a perfect cocktail for me.... elderflower, gin and prosecco. Perfection. The burrata was delicious and pork belly with figs outstanding. Waiter service was great without being intrusive. Not cheap but great for a special night out
4
Very special whisky pairing dinner experience. We were all in a separate smaller dining room, the whisky host was very knowledgeable and good with sharing the knowledge and experience, while still giving each table sufficient space and time to enjoy our own experience. Food was consistent and service was excellent without being obstrusive. Definitely would recommend to novices and connoisseurs to come while it's available
5
Fine, authentic Italian cuisine in a superb setting. Excellent value for Singapore too. Service was spot on and the chef popping out to explain a few courses to us wasd a very nice touch. Highly recommended
4
Totally enjoyed the experience at OSO, the service staff are knowledgable of the food the restaurant serves and are able to provide valuable suggestions.
4
We dined at the first floor of the restaurant - A slightly different atmosphere but the food tasted as good as i remembered - elegant and tasty.
5
We had the 6 course tasting menu and it was delicious . Service was immaculate and the setting very modern and cosy. An excellent evening. Very good value considering the outstanding product. Excellent treat! Thank you!
5
We hosted a company event at OSO Grillery and we were not disappointed. We received rave reviews from our clients on the quality of the food and best of all, the staff at OSO were attentive and efficient, serving above and beyond what we had asked for. Thank you for making our event memorable

I get emails from Oso for time to time about their Saturday lunch specials. I haven't been back to the restaurant for sometime. But I must say, the food quality has not changed. The food is still very delicious and imaginative. It was a $40++ 4-course set lunch and it was worth every cent of it. It was a party of 5 and it was a unanimous that we had a very satisfying lunch. They had a good wine list and although I chose a cheaper wine, it was actually really good still. But the restaurant wasn't well patroned at that time. Probably because it was a weekend lunch or maybe the specials were not well advertised. But seriously, if you somehow get on their mailing list, it would be worth your while. It's now White Asparagus Season and they have their $40++ Saturday set lunch. I'll definitely be heading there. It sounds like I'm promoting the place...haha...I am. Because I hate to see good restaurants vanish in this overcrowded restaurant business

2nd time here - amazing food and wine at a decent price point. wine list is great with lots of italian varieties. tried the fois gras, bably lobster and cod plates. all well balanced and fresh. only complaint was we seated on the balcony which became the smokers area as people from inside continued to cycle outside for cigarettes - either stop this or advertise it as the smoking section
5
Be adventurous and try the chef surprise menu .. can choose between 3 course to 8 courses ! You will not be disappointed. Food is excellent and wide selection of wines- reasonably priced. We were given a private room for our party of 8 with a dedicated waiter who provided with immaculate service. Attention to the most minute detail. We will definitely be back as it's a rare find in Singapore where ambience, food creativity , extensive wine selection, immaculate service come together. Highly recommend

Perhaps one of the best Italian ristorante I have dinned in. Ordered a beef Carpaccio and a risotto which was rich and creamy and al dente. Owned and managed by the chef and their passion came thru both in the food and the atmosphere. Given the popularity, reservations are strongly recommended. Parking may be tough given the numerous high profile restaurants in the area and taxi is recommended.

Visited with my wife last Saturday and had an excellent experience. The food was awesome, menu was comprehensive without being overwhelming and the wines we tried were all very tasty. The chef paid us a couple of visits to deliver food himself and enquire about the food. This is probably the best Italian food I've eaten in SGP in my 3.5yrs here. The slow cooked pork belly and lobster Fettuccini were both really tasty, the starters and desserts we had were also extremely good. The chocolate tart is a winner. My wife's only criticism was that she couldn't select the cheese on her cheeseboard. A small detail but worth considering for the restaurant in future. Looking forward to going back soon

Opinions are like... Well nevermind, but everyone has one. I do truly hope that restaurants like this will continue to be appreciated for creativity, passion and hard work which goes into creating them. This place has soul.. Experience it while you can.
5
I am not a food critic but after so many years I patronise Oso, consistency is they word to describe this establishment, food service, venue and atmosphere are just right.
Basically no bad surprise and good time.
Thank you
5
A michline quality resturant with out the star. This place cant get anymore Italian. Just challange the staff and they will deliver. Pasta risotto was awesome and veal shank was like melted butter.
5
Amazing quality for the price! We had the $40 lunch menu and a bottle of Cabernet which didnt break the bank
5
Absolutley fantastic at every level. Great food, wine atmosphere and value. Will continue to go back again and again.
5
Been going regularly for 5 years consistent top quality food service and decor - never less than great.
They always remember me by name what a great team.
I like the buratta, Stracci and 'fregola' dessert ...
5
This was a very high class restaurant and the service was inpecable.We had the chefs 5 course dinner( there were 3 and 4 too) which was excellent! The waiter asked if there was anything we would like included or not wanted which was good as we knew the courses would be what we liked! We were not disappointed
5
It was my husbands anniversary. We decided to go to Oso. There was a hostess waiting to lead us to the restaurant which was on the ground floor. The set was great. Classic Ambience. Great food. Great service. The Chef came to each table to check and that made it very personal.It was a heavy meal and so we opted out of desert.The chef sent us a Tiramisu cake in honour of husbands birthday. We were touchedAll in all a wonderful evenin

Was invited to OSO for a private corporate dinner. The free flow of champagne and wines was very welcome. The sommelier was very knowledgeable and spent a bit of time to explain the wines of Burgundy. The food was very well presented - very stylish and exquisite. However, the taste was nothing to write home about. The risotto with truffle was average, the beef tagliata was very dry - almost powdery (I had to swallow with a swig of wine like swallowing a pill as it was just too dry). The appetiser and the desserts were good, in fact the most enjoyable dishes of the four courses we had. One caveat is that I usually avoid Italian food unless the restaurant has very good food
3
Had a birthday celebration here. The complimentary tiramisu and cheese were a nice touch. However, the festive dinner set was quite a let down. The fish carpaccio didn't taste fresh and was bland. The foie gras wasn't caramelized enough. The saving grace of the meal was the turkey ragout- the hand made pasta was al dente with a nice hint of truffle. The scallops were okay too but nothing to rave about. We also ordered a dish of lamb rack and although palatable, it wasn't outstanding. A tad disappointed with the food as the restaurant had received great reviews on TA. The ambience was good and service is largely dependable on who is serving you. I can only credit impeccable service to one of the female servers - a tall, Chinese lady (didn't catch her name) and the hostess. The wine was good and reasonably priced.
5
Visited on recommendation and didn't disappoint. Very welcoming greeting by the team and chef. Lovely surroundings. We chose the fresh pasta which was fantastic, topped off with some quality parmegano. Staff were attentive and chef made an appearance which was a nice touch.
5
One of the best lunches we've had in Singapore, lazy, long and totally delicious. Oh, and great value too. Discovered by accident, will be returning soon.
4
We did prefer the Italian restaurant, however it was fully booked so we tried the French restaurant instead. A little noisy to start with as there was a lot of people in the Bar region. However the dinner was very nice in good friends company.
5
it was an amazing experience. People were very pleased with the service, the quality of food, wine in your restaurant. Value added service - like helping our staff to call for taxi to return to their hotels.Great and fantastic job by staff and awesome food by the Chef
5
The restaurant is in a two story colonial building with charm. It has an Italian and Japanese restaurants. My choice is Italian. It was recommended by two business partners of different nationality. They built up the expectation and I must say they were right. I suggest after your main course go and sit on the verandah at the bar and have your dessert, cognac and coffee
5
Favorite Italian restaurant in Singapore. Wine list is phenomenal! The dining area decoration is not great but restaurant almost full all the time and great atmosphere. Place is good for romantic dinners, but also for gatherings with friends or even corporate dinner. Food is really tasty.
5
There are many fine Italian restaurants in Singapore, OSO restaurant has to be one of them. The food here is amazing. Better than most Italian restaurants in Italy. The food prices aren't unreasonable, and the food is really authentic Italian with some of the ingredients being flown out from Italy regularly. Food is very well presented and nice portions too. Staff are very professional the service is excellent and very friendly and attentive. A perfect night, beautiful ambience and gorgeous food. The personally greeting touch by the owner to make sure that youâ€™re dinning and food meets the expectations is a big plus. Would highly recommend. I love it that much, I will be back very soooon

Was there last night with 4 friends. Came  in at 8pm and was only served 4 bowls of soup from 8-930pm. Waitress told us at 9pm that the mains are coming in 10 mins. Didn't happen.Paid the soup and wine and left at 935pm! Never coming back. Lack of staff, horrible service and the lobster bisque was .... Need I say more 
5
One for the memories; the atmosphere is great; nice reserved style which is typical of higher end Italian restaurants. The staff are really good with attentive service and a well managed efficiency. The food was really good - interesting that it's under seasoned (for our taste) but they seem to know it and have fresh pepper and salt on hand - nice touch. Wine list is extensive and covers the Italian range really well - and not stupidly expensive. Would thoroughly recommend this one for those special meals!
5
We had dinner at this excellent restaurant serving Italian cuisine, Japanese and grill. Tastefully decorated, suitable for both romantic dinners that company. The dishes are sublime, especially if you take advice from the chef Diego. Dishes that have nothing to envy to the three Michelin stars in Italy. The wine list is outstanding
5
Authentic Italian fare. From the simple classics to the rich and rare. The best of European Service.
4
The service was really good, the chef actually comes up to serve you the dish! The food had a good presentation as well.
5
I had dinner herr with a family group and found it purely as it is so close to the Dorsett Hotel (where we were staying). What a find! OK, it is a bit of a treat in terms of price, but the quality of the food, service and ambience entirely justify what you pay. Top quality ingredients, excellent unhurried experience and even a personal visit from the chef, to make sure we enjoyed our meal. This was an excellent dining experience and I would definitely want to return when I am next in Singapore
5
The food was amazing.For people who love cheese is great. The chef was expert and truly passionate. He is enthusiastic about the product that he can find in Italy. He looks for refine products that also in Italy is so difficult to taste.The location is nice and well-coming. 
4
Reasonably priced set lunch that is served promptly by efficient servers. The bread basket had a variety of warm delicious breads. The mushroom soup was good. The mains - selection of penne, sea bass or goose leg - were average. The dessert crostata - a small dark chocolate tart served with milk ice cream - was delectable.
5
Had dinner on a Friday evening - four of us on the (delightfully smoking-friendly!) terrace. Food was honestly some of the best Italian we've had in Singapore. (Recommend burrata, pork belly, carpaccio... But almost everything.)Service was fantastic, both of the founders came out to check on us and the wait staff were great. Will be going back soon
4
If you're looking for high end Italian comfort food in Singapore, this is the place - it's got a very comfortable clubbable feel to the interior, the staff are mostly attentive and the food is well executed - the Chef made a huge effort for us when he heard we were celebrating which was lovely, and they still have a great and very reasonably priced wine list - this won't be cutting edge daring Michelin food, but it will make you happy
4
I come to Singapore from time to time and have been trying out different restaurants for casual business dinners. Oso is one the best I have found so far. I went on a Tuesday evening and the restaurant was not that busy. The waiters were very helpful in helping us decide on food and wine choices. Great pasta. If you are looking for one of those posh restaurants to impress your guests then this is not the one. But it is ideal if you want to relax after a tough day at work
5
Ducked in to Oso while looking for a place to eat when a rainstorm came. What a find! For starters, the decor insides the bar section is one of a kind. Beautifully done. Our server/bartender was an Italian man named Giuliano who was an absolute pleasure. He was a great chat and welcomed us like family - great service always makes the food better. We ordered a bottle of white from Napa and had spicy tuna sushi to nibble on. It was impossible not to order *everything* on the menu but alas, we were full from a stroll through Chinatown. If we were locals we'd 100% come back and recommend this as a romantic date night or a upscale business meeting. Thank you Giuliano for a wonderful evening and an absolutely delicious find. Best of luck in Singapore
5
I have been going to Oso since they begun! Even before that, I had been supporting Diego and Stephane's restaurants since they came to Singapore. My children grew up going to Oso and now they are all grown up and starting their families soon, I believe they will continue the tradition of eating here! I believe Oso is easily the Italian restaurant in Singapore with the best ambiance. The setting is always elegant with nice Italian music playing in the background and the restaurant is almost always filled with a nice buzz. As Oso is upstairs of a shophouse, you almost feel like you could be anywhere in a sophisticated Italian restaurant (in NYC or in Milan). Pricing here is reasonable and about the same pricing as many neighbourhood casual Italian eateries around Singapore. Hence I think they have the best value for money! Oso is the perfect place for romantic dates, family dinners or corporate events. My favourite foods here are mostly their meats (more than their pastas) and their desserts. Service is competent enough. Always a delightful experience when I am there

Food is ok... Nothing special... Service is ok... Ambience is ok too... Nothing special ... It lacks identity ..lacks that special something to make it special..
4
Service is good. Staffs are friendly
Service is good. Staffs are friendly
But food portion can be improved
5
It is one of the few Italian restaurants in Singapore that serves authentic Italian food with generous range of cheese. Burrata Cheese with Parma Ham is very good. All Pasta dishes are good. The service is very professional and courteous
5
Steak was just awesome! If I could will rate 11/10.
Service is flawless and great!
Great place for Business lunch/ dinner and private event.
5
We have been going to OSO for over 5 years. It was the first fine dining restaurant that we went to when we arrived in Singapore. The food is excellent and the service is fantastic. We have never walked away disappointed. From OSO wine nights and special dinners to celebrating special occasions, it delivers. The chefs are very flexible with dietary requirements and nothing phases them. It's not the cheapest Italian on the island but well worth it
2
It's a well situated restaurant that benefits from the local hotels and visitors to the now booming tourist and foodie trade in the areaThe decor is plush and yet warm and welcomingThe staff are polite albeit may be with a little too much starch in the collarSlow generally the service was at least consistent in thatThe menu was enticing and would likely raise a few eyebrows to the uninitiated The food was well- so soThe linguini was passable at best and a bit on the bland side The pork belly was fatty and tasty We didn't bother with desert with such slow service and kids to check onNot somewhere I would revisi
5
Oso needs no introduction, having been one of the top Italian restos in Singapore since it joined the culinary market in 2004. I love how I can almost hear classic Italian music playing in my mind the moment I looked upon the vines growing along its upper balcony and the beautiful exterior of its heritage conservation shophouse. The moment you stepped over its threshold, you are transported to a charming and swanky atmosphere where style meets elegance, and be amazed with some of the contemporary art pieces they have.This visit, as I wasn't feeling too hungry, I opted for the Maiale (slow roasted pork belly with my favourite black figs and balsamic honey). My friend had the Merluzzo (roasted cod with balsamico sauce). Both were fabulously done! Desserts was the Fragola (thinly sliced marinated strawberries in blasamico accompanied with strawberry sherbet) and Pistacchio gelato.I love how Oso always makes me feel so welcome whenever I visit. The staff are friendly and warmth, and service always has that personal touch. They do not mind nor intrude if we take a while to decide on food. The staff are always on hand to assist with any recommendation. It feels so family
1
I went to Oso Ristorante in Singapore in July 2016 and I've never eaten such an ordinary pasta in my life. To make it worse, the service was terrible. The 2 Italian guys (waiters: a bald guy and a guy with spectacles) were unfriendly, cocky and to an extent almost dictatorial. We'll never ever visit this place again. Reasons are simple: ordinary food and terrible service
4
I love the food at OSO, it's a favorite place for both myself and my friend, who specifically asked to dine there. We shared a two-person Burata platter, my friend had the whole baked fish, & I had the home-made pappardelle. My friend loved her fish, which was nicely presented whole at first & then de-boned & arranged beautifully on another plate with broccoli & sauce. I had a taste, it was super yummy. My pappardelle was cooked perfectly & I loved every single bite right to the end. I don't have pasta very often & I'm glad I saved my pasta indulgence for Oso as there was no disappointment here whatsoever! There was a table of 8 noisy & progressively more inebriated expats only a 2-top away from us that made it very difficult to hear my friend. Kudos to them for having a fab night, I just wish people could be a little more considerate to others. This is not the fault of the restaurant by any stretch of the imagination, it just would have been a perfect night without the drunk people. I rated atmosphere at 3 out of 5 because of the drunks
5
Beautiful ambience.. food was perfect! Service was exempelary. This is what an authentic italian place should feel like. It should reflect how warm the Italians are and how much they love and enjoy their food... it translates to the customers who actually feel the ambience along with the food.Only minor issue was the Veal Ravioli serving was really small. Other than that.. fantastico
5
New grill restaurant, just opened.
Fantastic meat! One of the best i ever had.Ambiance is really nice, the service excellent, but the meat is the highlight.
A lot of talent in the kitchen !
3
Food, staff and atmosphere was absolutely up to what I expected. They got a great wine- and cheese selection and try to get a table upstairs in the wine-room. :)
5
Unforgettable dining experience. Awesome ambience. A great range of very authentic Italian pasta menu, amazing steak house with outstanding meat quality, very comprehensive wine selection and very value for money.
I strongly recommend to everyone who wants a taste of high quality dining experience.
5
Delicious food efficiently served accompanied by Prosecco chilled.A perfect way to throw a farewell lunch for a dear friend.
4
Pretty restaurant that hits the right spot in the intersection of food quality, service, formality (not too formal) and price. I have been here 3 times now and while a few dishes (the truffle risotto most recently, which had an odd and not very pleasant texture and lacked the creamy starchiness of risotto -- maybe they use a different rice?) here and there have been misses, overall it's terrific. This time we especially enjoyed one of the pasta specials: homemade tagliatelle with fresh white asparagus (shaved) and parmesan. Service is a bit odd: dishes are delivered by a variety of servers. Wine is only somewhat overpriced, unlike much of Singapore where it is grossly overpriced. Will return again
3
We came here because we want to go to some place nice and we both love Italian food. My boyfriend was here for a business dinner last time and he said it was impressive so that's why we were here.But after the dinner, we both agree that we probably won't come back with quite a disappointment on the food.Restaurant itself is nice and staff are nice.We won't say the food is bad but really not up to our expectation with such a raving review . While he had the seafood pasta and capress ( another disappointment as he wanted burrito which he had last time and said it was very impressive but already out when we were having dinner at seven ) , I had the ciopinno and pasta with amatriciana sauce. Firstly the seafood pasta is pretty average. I could go to anywhere doing a better seafood pasta with more seafood and tomato sauce than this one. The amatriciana pasta is another disappointment. The sauce is just way too thick and over-flavored. It's more like a pancetta stew over tagliatelle . My ciopinno is more like a seafood bisque than that. Was expecting better food here 
5
This just so reminded me of a restaurant in Milan both in terms of the quality of the food but also the style and ambience. The restaurant was buzzing when we went on a Saturday night and give me the immediate impression that I had made a good choice. The food, wine, service and after dinner sojourn in the balcony bar was all fantastic. Highly recommended
5
We dined here on May 28 as part of our Eat Singapore guide we received as a gift. We are SO happy this restaurant was in the book because we would never have stumbled upon it and it was the best meal we have had since moving here in July of 2015. The ambience was cozy and elegant, the service was impeccable and the food was delicious. I highly recommend the homemade stracci in wild boar red wine sauce as well as the tiramisu. We will definitely return
5
Super new restaurant, relatively small room for around 50 persons, but very nice ambiance.The highlight is nonetheless in the plate. The meat! I am no kid, but have very seldom had such a great meat in my entire life. I was thinking of becoming a Vegan... not a good idea to come here. I changed my mind!There is a lot of talent in the kitchen, and the service is excellent.I can't recommend the place enough
4
The restaurant has a great atmosphere and the service was good from the attentive staff. Dinner was good but not great or as good as my previous visit. The Burrata was out of stock so they replaced it with caprese which wasn't as nice and the tomatoes were overly salted. The pasta was as good as you could get from most decent Italian restaurants. Nothing spectacular and could have had more flavour. The staff made it a good night
4
Enjoyed the time there. Food was delicious, also they have lots of expensive wines there are also reseanable priced ones which fits to your food selection.
5
Service was good, food was great, only the aircon was not strong enough so was a bit warm coz the restaurant was full house. It was a little bit noisy too..
5
I like the decoration and the atmosphere of the restaurant.
The staff is great and the food usually pretty good.
There is a large choice of Italian cheese which we can choose from.
5
One of the best Italian restaurants in Singapore, excellent food, great service, excellent decor, and not too expensive for lunch. Been there 3 times in 3 years and always excellent.
4
Great Service at any point in time the various waiters attended to us with foresight.Excellent tasty food, very nice presentation.Good selection of winesWe reserved the separate room in the wine depot - very nice to be surrounded by a large selection of wine and have them just in front of you.There is also a small balcony to dine outside for people who want to enjoy the street view.Nothing to complain, prices according to the level of quality and service.Very recommendable restaurant
5
Due to the heavy demands of Valentine's day dining we managed to get a reservation at Oso for the day before. We arrived at 8.30pm and was charmingly escorted to our seating by the attendant downstairs at the entrance. This restaurant makes the effort towards positive client experience by shaping your first impressions. The staff were extremely professional, friendly, knowledgable and warm...the perfect combo. The food was delicious, bordering on a fine dining experience. Kudos to the chef and the kitchen staff. Recommendations based on my positive experience are; tegamino - pan fried egg with black truffle puree, agnello - which is an 8 hour oven baked lamb rack (which is simply divine) and the crostata. Thank you Oso for a wonderful dining experience. This venue definitely deserves multiple visits
5
We had a wonderful evening last Saturday. My brother and Sister in Law flew into to celebrate their 25th wedding anniversary so we took them to OSO. Beautiful table on the al-fresco balcony table for 4 of us, attentive service, cocktails and dessert. The food was excellent and we loved every course. The waiter was helpful with suitable wines. It was a wonderful evening
5
A couple of girlfriends were looking to celebrate a birthday and having never been to OSO, i was excited.Had pre-dinner champagne at a charming al-fresco bar hidden at the balcony for a champagne. We were ushered through the main dining to our private room, the main dining was a definite setting for a lively European dining ambience.The private room was filled with paintings of vegetables, walls were draped in red curtains, and a huge mirror on the ceiling!. There was a certain sophisticated elegance and charm of this room.For starters, the poached veal was delicately and thinly sliced, melting in my mouth and the tuna-capper sauce was amazing. Sicilian sea urchin combined crunchy of the vegetables was surprisingly pleasant. I had the pappardelle pasta– delicious sauce complimented by the sweetness of the onions and saltiness from pork. A few of us shared a 1.2 tomahawk from their grill. It was simply grilled to perfection. To wrap up the evening , we had a selection of Italian cheeses with more wine. i'm pretty surprised about reasonable price and healthy selection of wines. And a round of limoncello which got us in the perfect celebratory mood for the birthday cakeOverall, the ladies and I all agreed the food was served to a high standard and we can’t wait to try what else is on the menu the next time we visit. Many special thanks to the attentive service that made the birthday celebration a memorable time
5
Not sure why they rank so low (82 when I write the review) in TA but every penny spent here is worth. If you are wanting to celebrate with your loved one and you like Italian food (even if you dont like you may start fancying it after a visit to OSO), look no further. I would not say OSO is just another Italian Restaurant. It is a Dining Experience. We had an event in the restaurant followed by dinner and it was my most memorable dinner. The small servings of appetiser and dessert enabled us to taste half of their menu. Loved the idea. Presentation was mind blowing. And for taste cannot thank the chef enough. Risotto is the best in world I tasted here. Good wine collection and very attentive staff. After every course they dutifully checked if we liked the food. When diners were leaving and the linen was getting changed, I was amazed to see the hygiene standards that staff were observing.Bit on the costlier side but I would rather save up and go here than dine somewhere else. Thank you OSO, you presented a fabulous evening to all of u
5
I have been visiting OSO with my family and friends for the past 10 years, and it has never disappointed as my favorite restaurant in Singapore. The food is delicious, and service is impeccable. OSO is always on my list of must go places for anyone visiting. Thanks to Stefano, Diego, and the team, keep up the good work
4
I was impressed with their very attentive, friendly and experience service staff.We have 2 starters, one main course, a mix dessert platter and caviar.They will help to portion (split) into two portion for each dish.I love the presentation of the caviar. The doneness of the spaghetti was just right.The dessert platter was so so only (Almond cake does not have the taste of almond, orange chiffon was a bit too sweet, the panna cotta and tiramisu were above average
5
There are two great Italian restaurants in the world...one in Christchurch, New Zealand, which I have already reviewed and tonight we found a second. As seasoned world travellers for over 30 years there are few countries we have not visited so I feel competent to say the OSO restaurant in Singapore is an absolutely fabulous place to spend an evening. The food is authentic Italian with some of the ingredients being flown out from Italy regularly. The service is impeccably...very professional and sophisticated, yet friendly. The owner. Stephane Colleoni , personally checks and greets each table to make sure your experience. Is as perfect as possible. Highly recommended
5
I have been to this wonderful restaurant a number of times but couldn't resist writing a review this time. Twice this month alone - once with the wife and once with friends and we had a fabulous experience both the times. What's gives the highest satisfaction is the service and we are treated no less than VIPs with excellent service led by Stephan himself and his entire staff. Excellent option for vegetarians and the best wines and desserts too. Highly recommended and I would go again and again.
4
The service and ambience are excellent and the food is good without being outstanding. It is a special occasion restaurant and they treated my wife to a complimentary cake with candles for her birthday. I have been here previously for a business dinner and found it a suitable venue for a business meeting
4
Staff was warm and welcoming. I wasn't feeling too well that day and they made sure hubby and i were comfortable throughout the meal. I ordered the cod, which was delicate and well cooked. Rosemary mashed potatoes were delicious. The crab appetizer had a good balance of flavour, although i found a few bits of shell in the meat. We would have stayed for dessert (the staff actually insisted that we did) if only i felt better that day. Overall, a great place for dinner
5
The roasted pork belly was divine! It was worth a second night dining at Oso in the same week. It was served with carmelized figs and was the perfect combination.The lightly breaded veal was also delicious. The dishes were a delight to look at as well. Edible art!The private room ambiance was relaxing and pleasant
2
This used to be our favourite restaurant a while ago.We went in to celebrate a special occasion last evening. We were firstly greeted by a cockroach that was scampering on the table. A waiter finally came and calmly caught the guy when he rested on the base of our wine glass.To add to our disdain the napkin had holes in them! I was amazed!We had our most special friends over to celebrate with us. The food was so poor; we were quite embarrassed with the experience. The black truffle risotto was overcooked and tasted really weird! When I gave my opinion and so did my friend to the waiter and a senior person, it seemed he didn't really didn't believe ur or our opinion didn't matter.Don't bother going to this place unless you like to be treated with this kind of an experience!
3
The first time I liked food but second time less so. On the second visit the burrata was more than twice the size of the first visit, an actual while round this time; leading me to believe we got cheated the first time and they served us pieces of scraps for full price originally. The food was not as good second time either. The foie gras terrine which is usually my favourite was over salted and tasted weird, I could not eat most of it. The scallops had rubbery chewy sides and I could not finish it either. The rabbit ragout tastes weird and we left half to side of that too. Ravioli would be good if it wasn't drowned in cream. Service is good though as is the coffee. If you want a basic pasta in a nice ambience it's fine but don't expect too much from the food.
2
The restaurant was nice in the atmosphere the meat room and the wine cellar looked amazing. We had 3 course dinner. The wine list wasn't up to date. It can also make a pretend list. The starter plate with cold cuts where nice but we didn't know what anything was. The Melanzane was not to bad could have been served a bit smaller. The Papardelle alla amatriciana was more a Papardelle alla ragu. Nothing in the dish was similar with a Amatriciana. I had the Milanese. It was ok it could have been a little thicker. No contorni(side orders) where available. The desserts where Ok. Gelato(ice cream) where good. The Semi-freddo was good. Because of the high rating on Google / tripadvisor I was wanting more.
5
Food was really nice (although not the best that I've tasted) and the portion for each serving was adequate. All service crew were friendly & outstanding. The only feedback was despite requesting for a quiet seat during my reservation and even called to confirm for it, I am seated at the level 2 hall that was quite noisy as there was another large group of diners. Apart from that, it was a really fine Italian restaurant.Overall, nothing to fault them in terms of service and food and I would definitely recommend it to others
3
Food was just ok...service excellent and so is the ambienec..however considering all the views about great food..it was disappointing. it is quite ok but nothing really great.
5
Great fresh pasta, good friendly service in a lively atmosphere at a reasonable price - it is one of our favourites
5
Table of 4. First visit. Great service. We were proposed a tasting me twice was really amazing. Good Italian wines and not too pricey. Bonus: chef and chief of service speak French !
Highly recommended
5
With the ambience of an osteria, this 1st floor restaurant has smart linen table clothes and friendly, attentive service, which included a visit to our table from the chef. The pasta with whole baby lobster was delicious, and the Tiramisu, the best we tasted in Singapore. Recommended
4
I visited the restaurant for dinner on 1 Jan. The restaurant was rather empty when I arrived at 7pm, but it started to fill up throughout the night.Despite it's posh-posh fine-dining posture, the service staff was very friendly. They made us feel "homely". We ordered soup & appetizer, and 2 pastas. The portions are "fine-dining" but I was full at the end of the meal. The pasta was very fresh, but would have loved a bit more options
1
Terribly disappointing experience at Oso. Ok the restaurant itself is quite nice and the service was good but the food was very, very disappointing. The waiter recommended their stracci pasta with wild boar and red wine which was very plain. I ordered another pasta which was the papardelle and that was good. But the main course was the most overrated and most bland dish i have ever tried in a restaurant. The 8 hour lamb rack was very bland, had no flavor whatsoever. You know its bad when you have to order mustard to eat lamb. There was a huge layer of fat on the lamb which made it aesthetically unpleasant. Overall my advice is to skip going to Oso. Its very overrated. Might as well eat hawker food

Went to Oso with the family just before Christmas. Excellent service from start to finish with the food and wine matching it. Oso is a good place for a special night out as has the lot, including ambience and location. The prosciutto is wonderful and they do a really good Osso Bucco
4
Went to Oso for christmas dinner with wife on 25 Dec. Place was nicely decorated to set the christmas mood. Ratio of diners to the service managers was v good; there were a number of well trained service managers who were friendly and attentive. Cozy and nice ambience.We ordered appetitizers - mushroom soup and foie gras, and dinner being seafood spaghetti. Loved it.Would return again to Oso
4
Very nice setting of a characteristic Italian restaurant. Menu is great with lots of Italian classics, and wine menu had a lot of choices not only from Italy but from all over the world at pretty decent price. Despite a beautiful presentation however, all our dishes fell a bit short tasting wise. The meat of our fiorentina was cooked to perfection but it was not seasoned at all. The hollandaise for the asparagus tasted more like pure unsalted butter. The branzino was overpowered by a thick cover of tomatoe caper sauce. Osso bucco was great. We had nevertheless a good time. The service was friendly too.
5
Wait stuff is wonderful. The moment we were seated we were greeted by a number of waiters telling us to enjoy our meal. Ambience is nice and romantic enough for me and my partner's anniversary dinner. Food looks and tastes good. Food served might look to be a small portion, but it's deceiving filling. The filleto beef steak is juicy and succulent.
5
Lovely food, big selection. Very approachable staff, good service by Kumar. Not very big portions, which is good as by the time you are finished with a starter and a main you still have space for a dessert :) Good wine!
4
A wonderful evening. Great setting, super service. 4 people ordered 3 courses each, and everyone raved about the food. Well done Oso!
2
Food, menu and wait-staff need improvement.Staff somewhat casual, caught up with themselves and for too inattentive for a restaurant of this stature.The food was also not up to the mark at all. The Wagyu beef sirloin that was served was entirely disinterated and absolute rubbish !Entirely wrong dessert was served first in a restaurant where there were only 3 covers for the entire afternoon
1
We were excited to try this restaurant housed in a lovely building in China Town. The service was truly terrible, we had to keep asking for everything, and after two hours and many enquires we finally received our main courses, unfortunately three steaks were cold and served on cold plates. The food was good but after two hours we were amazed they would serve us cold food, that we couldn't eat. The Manager said he wouldn't charge for the food, but we didn't go with Friends to dinner for a free, cold, steak!

We had our annual Xmas Celebration recently and this place was chosen after majority vote by the staff.Food: starters was average....the most favourite was its eggplant. Fresh scallops for the main course. Desserts I loved their tiramisu cake. The warm service and the ambience was very good.The staff was very approachable and helpful. The chef was walking around to make sure everything was good
4
Good food and good service staffs. Very approachable & professional staffs. Only setback is the waiting time for your food to be served. We had a 5 course Xmas dinner. It took each course at least 20 minutes to be served after we had finished the earlier ones. We were there at 8pm and managed to finished and walk out past 11pm. The music was rather loud too. Need to improve on these area
5
Have been to OSO many times and have never been disappointed . Staff are helpful and attentive. Co-owner Stepane does his rounds and spends time with guests. Chef Diego also walks around for time to time to ensure all is going well. My favorite dishes are the baked egg with truffle sauce , poached pear with cheese and truffle sauce , capellini with crab meat, veal Milanese , burrata cheese .... Quite a few others are good as well but these are my favorites. For dessert , I would recommend the chocolate tart , tiramisu and the selection of gelato. Meals are very satisfying , there is a good selection of wine too. The warm service and ambience is what makes me come back.Pricing for dinner is about $100-150 per person depending on which wines you chose
5
I have been there recently because of a wine dinner with only italian wines organized by a local wine company. The food was typical Italian (pasta, risotto, truffles etc) and perfectly cooked. The restaurant is big and very elegant, it has different separate private rooms, one of them in the wine cellar
4
Went there for dinner with family after hearing good stuff about this restaurant from colleagues visited them earlier. Dinner was good, all classic Italian dishes. Great setting, ambiance and very attentive service without being too imposing. All in all good choice for either corporate function, or family or romantic dinner
3
Oso ristorante has been a thriving establishment since 2008 and it's easy to see why. Well crafted meals presented with style along with very good service. The general managers both hail from Italy and know how to take care of customers and run a restaurant. Our table had linguini with wild boar as a starter along with beef carpaccio and fresh burratta with tomatoes. All of which were excellent but my favourite was the boar slow cooked and oh so tender. For mains we had the veal Milanese which was nicely presented cooked perfectly and had a deep rich flavour ( at times you can order this dish else where and there is little to distinguish it from chicken )We also orders red the oso bucco again perfect. Especially the bone marrow. Always keen to test the classics we ordered linguini with pomodoro y basilico. The linguini cooked perfectly and the sauce was again perfection. For dessert we ordered gelato and a tiramisu. Once again perfectly crafted. We will be back yet again when in Singapore.
4
The meal was amazing, they had a great choice of vegetarian, authentic Italian food and that really impressed me. I've been there twice and both the times, the service was amazing. The food quality was amazing and really up to the mark. I would say that it's a better place for dinner than anything else but, it does have a really traditional touch to it
4
Nicely greeted, and lead to table. Clientele mixed but quite expatty. Most couples and a few 4, 6 or 8 groups. Dress code very mixed, most only shirt and pants, ladies in all a tad bit dressed up.The starters were fine and the main course (1 of 2) was fine as well. We sent back the risotto because the rice was uncooked (but tasted fine), and got it back still with hard rice, we felt like sending back but did not bother. I had tagliatelli with white truffle which I liked. The french speaking maitre'D came over and we had a nice discussion, which ended in the restaurant offering free dessert (excellent). We will come back given the ambience, the nice reception and the way we were cared for when we encountered the risotto problem
5
I have been to OSO several times and it remains the best restaurant for me The food is fantastic, wine excellent (I always follow recommendation and I have not been disappointed)I recommend cold cut and fantastic Italian cheeseThe pasta is nonetheless a must try. If like me you thought pasta can't be fine food then try it here: art
1
Went to Oso for what was supposed to be a great lunch. First of all we requested that the white truffles be sliced at the table to which our request was refused. The service was ungraceful, to say the least. The food was tasteless, and so were the white truffles which arrived at the table wet and soggy.They even served their white truffles with dessert (pannacotta) it appeared as if the truffles had been soaked in a sweet liqueur, perhaps that partly explained why I had trouble detecting any hint of truffle taste
5
I recently had dinner at Oso Ristorante with a group of friends from work. I can saw that this was probably the best restaurant I have eaten at in Singapore yet. The cheese plates before dinner were out of this world and the selection was unbelievable. The entree' was outstanding and the best part was dessert, definitely do not miss that !Everyone in our party also thought the same and the atmosphere was very relaxed with great friendly service. Highly recommende
4
OSO has been one of my favourite Singapore restaurants. I hadnt been for a couple of years and on my way through decided to take some friends for a visit and pick up the tab. Unfortunately it was my worst ever OSO experience. Service was deadly slow, embarrassingly so. Meals were of the quality I expect and I would come back again. Must have caught them on an off day.
5
Last year I went to OSO to celebrate my partner's birthday and decided to make it a yearly affair. Busy Saturday night and the restaurant is on full house even at around 10pm!! Did not manage to have a seat inside the restaurant but being offered a table at the balcony. Perfect!! Romantic ambiance. Being served by Kumar. Wonderful service even though he is so busy serving the other guests. A very polite gentleman and always smile. The food is very fantastic as usual. Ordered pumpkin soup, Pollo, Cod fish and panna cotta. Not to forget a very professional staff, Fauzy who come over to our table to assist us even though he is being stationed in the restaurant. Will be back again
5
From the moment we arrived at Oso, the service we received was excellent - very personable and attentive staff (a rarity in Singapore!). The ambiance of the place is spot on - it is very romantic yet still has a real buzz about it. The food was divine (especially the Burrata) and the wine the waiter recommended was delicious and a perfect match. Will definitely be back
4
I am compelled to write this after dining here a week ago and realising how much better it is than Mozza. For starters, i really fancied a caprese and, very accomodating and although it wasn't on the menu, our waiter asked the chef who very kindly put together one of the best burrata and tomato entre i have had. Bravo! I then enjoyed the boar meat pasta with some lovely wines, the standout being a Moscato D'asti with dessert. Slightly sweet with a fizz and perfect finish. Thank you. Service throughout the evening was faultless. Ambience perfect. It was a birthday dinner with friends and it was a lovely evening. We were last here in 2010 and it is just as good
5
The restaurant presented beautifully, the staff polite and attentive. The food delicious. Absolutely recommend. It's not cheap but if you can be charged 180 for 4 meals at Jamie's Forum then this place is an absolute steal. Wine is always expensive in Singapore so if you remove that from the bill the price was very reasonable. Will go back when next in tow
5
This is a great special occasion restaurant. The food, service, wine list and ambiance is all consistently good. We always bring new friends to this place as it has quite a hip and happening vibe and you can rely on the service being almost perfect!
5
The dining rooms were well tucked away and perfect for private events with very minimal waiting time for the various courses.
5
Went there for a business dinner... am pleasantly surprised how busy it is even on a weekday which create a nice dinning atmosphere which suit my mood for that day.. Food is great and come with a great wine list!. recommended for any occasion~
4
I came and looked at the menu and was sure it was going to be a phenomenal dinner - the menu selection is very good and if you are vegetarian they have good choices. However it has hits and misses. We ordered the wine and they didn't let us try it first before they served it. I ordered the tegaminio - I didn't know what it was and the description led me to believe it's a cheese dish but actually it's two fried eggs so I was bitterly disappointed. Ordered the Milanese veal - it was much Nicer than it looked - succulent and moist but there was too much so I couldn't finish. The osso bucco in most restaurants are too much meat but in this case the portions were very manageable.
5
We were walk in customers and were welcomed warmly. Service was excellent with several staff mixing with clients. We had baked fish and a fettuccine. Both meals were delicious and well presented. We also shared probably the best tira misu we have ever had. An excellent meal well enjoyed

So if I want to review a fine dining restaurant, what are the criterias I look at?Food, Service, Wine list/price, decor, ambiance. After trying out countless restaurants in Singapore over the past 8 years, I will pick Oso as the number 1 Italian. Here's why:Service (10/10)This is as close to perfection as you can get in Singapore factoring in labor shortages and foreign employment limitations. The restaurant is actively managed by Stephane Colleoni and chef Diego Chiarini and they have the service streamlined to impeccable perfection. Few points to note: unlike other Italian restaurants, they don't push mineral water (still or sparkling) on to you. Even when I order mineral water as the first bottle, the waiter will always ask me if I want to continue or top up with ice water. Thats refreshing from other Italian restaurants that want to make money with constantly opening bottles for you. At all times the waiters are fully aware of your needs without being overbearing.Wine: (10/10)The wine list is the best in Singapore. I've carefully looked at all the wine menus in every restaurant and the usual mark up is around 300%. At Oso, you can get a crisp Chablis for only SGD 72, a wonderful Barolo Azelia 2009 for only 109 SGD. If you wish to go higher end, the Brunello di Montalcino Pianrosso is only SGD 148 (This wine retails for SGD 90). If you have any doubt what to order, ask Stephan who will give you plenty of good options.Food: (9/10)Their appetisers focus very much on the typical rustic hearty italian fare. I usually go with the Burratta. They have some more unconventional dishes like the fried eggs with truffles. Good selection of pastas and they even allow you to order a few and mix it so everyone gets a small taste of each. Finally, their main dishes is something that needs a bit of work on. I have been coming to Oso for 7 years and I find the choices of 8 hour slow cooked lamb, beef tenderloin and salted baked fish a little monotonous. But they are consistently well prepared year after year.Decor/Ambiance (10/10)if you like the "buzz", this restaurant gets packed on most nights with a very expat/local professional mixed crowd. Late orders also help diners like myself that usually come to eat after 9pm
5
In a town where we are spoiled for food choices, OSO never disappoints & compares very well with many of its much more expensive competition.This is about the 5th time I have been & find the food/service exceptional & great value for money.A must tr

I was at Oso for dinner on Aug 31 with 3 associates.Great atmosphere. Warm, dark tones. Very intimate. Really full for a Monday evening. The service is helpful and attentive. Ready to make recommendations on food and wine.Food was good. We had burrata cheese and salads for starters. They were a great way to kick off dinner. We had a brunello from toscano 2009 which was nice. For our main, we had a 1.2 kg t-bone medium rare that we shared among the 4 of us. It was great meat and really juicy. It came with potato wedges and asparsgus on the side. We had a barolo to go with it.Overall, it was an OSO-good dinner! Definitely coming back
3
We were here on a Friday's evening, we arrived at 8.30pm and only left at 10.45pm. We ordered the 5-course set meal, the food came out so slow that my palate was totally ruined and couldn't enjoy the 4th dish and dessert. The main course of meat was totally salty. It didn't help that the next table was so noisy, they laughed and talked loudly throughout the evening. I don't understand why such a restaurant can't hire more staff to wait the tables and one more chef to cook. And my friends who ate at the restaurant a few times confirmed that all his visits were like that
4
Me and My friend had a dinner and it was amazing.. The food taste good and the service was great. The wait staff assisted us and recommend delectable dishes from the menu..The ambience is cozy and a really nice place to chill out and relax over the week.. Price is reasonable and the dining experience is impeccable. .
5
I understand that cauliflower and foie gras with cauliflower and foie gras sauce, and risotto with black truffle are superb in this restaurant. You can also find suitable excellent wine here.
5
Excellent service and the food was great. Thanks for being so accommodating despite the many last minute changes.
5
Original Italian taste in Singapore...home made pasta, mozzarella ... and of course Italian wine. I think is the best Italian restaurant in Singapore
4
Waiters were attentive. Food and wine were great. We had veal and scallops- and a good bottle Sicilian Chardonnay. All were great. Nice environment in a cool part of town.
5
It was my first time to Oso, and indeed it lives up to its name. We had the SG50 menu, and my favourite is the cured salmon fennel salad and braised veal cheek. The wide selection of cheese and the preparation of cold cuts in full view of diners makes the entire experience fantastic
4
I live in Thailand, a country of food culture, and didnt expect such a nice experience in Singapore, that we often regard as more superficial...Well I was there with my girl friend from Poland, and searched the web for a decent place for her birthday.We ended up at Oso, and I can tell the not only service and food was really good, but for a place supposed to serve high end Italian cuisine, we were not assassinated by the bill. Prices were really reasonable. I don't live in Singapore, but if I have the chance to come back, I will certainly drop by Oso to get my Osso bucco!!
5
Place is not walk in, as it's not at the main street, but it's worth booking. It's run by Italians so you can be sure food there is authentic. It's in shop house and they have wine cabinet, so you can host private party in there surrounded by shelfs with bottles. They also have cheese room and you can go there ahd chef comes out and explains the cheeses! They had 3 different gorgonzolas (one was so soft, that u need to eat it with the spoon). There were also truffle cheese and one that is aged in wine. We tried 6 different ones for our cheese plate and they allow you to choose, not forcing to standart 2soft/2semi/2hard ones. Then we wanted one more round of some fav cheeses and were served. So it was great experience recommended to everybod
5
OSO offers a wonderful lunch set menu as well as wide range of dinner choices. The chef and the staff are very professional and friendly as well as they are very good at what they do. Pasta is a good choice to have since they really know how to maximize both the pasta and the ingridents. They serve the right portion and you will never feel too heavy. Near China town and they alsoi have Japanese restaurant on the first floor
4
People grouse, gripe, whine and whinge over the quality of service in Singapore. It is true. Asian nation citizens do not like to be in Service Industry (if they had a choice) because it is matter of "face". Unlike Western cultures, where if you are in service industry and your friends and family visit your establishment, they will not whisper behind you that you are "low on the class totem pole". Which leaves a black hole when it comes to service. But then once in a while you will be amazed that things are good and you get better than expected service which makes any meal extremely enjoyable. I have been OSO over the span of few years and I have never been disappointed. Dinner dates? No problemo. Group dinner? Absolutely no problemo? The food is exceptional and the wine list is pretty rock solid and the wine-guy is pretty good in selecting a good choice. Of course, the smart move they do is first to check your budget so that you don't get all embarrassed. :-) Would I go again? Not even a question to ask
5
A very impressive restaurant, probably the best Italian in Singapore. Lovely ambiance, the beautifully-appointed main dining room on the first floor contrasting nicely with the striking ground-floor entrance. Intelligent, attentive staff. A superb menu and very impressive wine list. No dish disappoints; most are astonishingly good. Very highly recommended indeed. Can't wait to try their Jakarta and Kunming branches
5
This is a top restaurant in Singapore. The food is well understood with break out air conditioned rooms for cheese, ham and wine. They have an amazing wine list and a beautiful setting. Busy with a good atmosphere.
4
been there few times, and it just got better each time. awesome food, great embience. great place to chill with friends / couple
5
It was not the first time we went to Oso Ristorante and every time has been a great experience. The last one was a couple of days ago as we invited our friends for a dinner to celebrate a new start in our life. To be very honest, i haven't seen such high sense of customer service and customer care.From the time we arrived to the time we were in the taxi to leave the staff, the manager, the chef, every one was just dedicated to make this dinner a unforgettable experience for us and our guests. A perfect combination of proactivity but with the necessary discretion No only the service is impeccable but the food was really great, serve with the perfect timing.The wine List is As well a key offer of Oso with good wine starting at a very affordable price.Thanks to all the Oso team, you guys are doing great
4
This is a charming restaurant, co-located with a chinese-style restaurant on the ground floor and an italian restaurant on the second floor. They seem to share a lobby and a hostess, but not the kitchens or the wait-staff. The food was terrific. I ordered the bisque and a chicken dish, both were delightful. My customer went with the pasta and was thrilled. We chatted with the elegant couple at the table next to us, enjoyed a VERY nice Barbaresco at an almost reasonable price, and overall spent a very pleasant two hours over dinner. Well worth the price and definitely worth re-visiting
5
Had a nice meal with my wife recently, it can be hard in Singapore to find value for money but this was one of the best we have been to after living in Singapore for 2 years. The service was fantastic right from when we walked in, they accommodated our table request and were attentive all evening. The menus were extensive and our selections were well prepared and tasted very nice.All up it was a very nice evening and I look forward visiting again very soon
4
I came here during the Singapore Restaurant week - could not quite remember the names of the dishes .Quality of food in general is very good, well executed. The restaurant has many sections, I did not explore the whole place but I saw other patrons going into another area, looking like a courtyard/bar area.The usual menu is very extensive but on the expensive side- I guess for a restaurant of such standing, it is only fair that it warrants such a price tag
5
Excellent produce and flavours, well cooked meat and fish. Varied wine list, very well priced range of Italian reds. Lovely dÃ©cor and great balcony bar too. If they can add chestnuts in honey to their cured meat platter they will be complete. Will definitely be back
5
This is my favourite restaurant in Singapore. I go here when I don't want to be disappointed and I never am. That being said I love sitting outside on the balcony - the ambience is just wonderful. Inside the acoustics make hearing your dining companion a little difficult but I understand that some customers like this buzz. The waiters are highly attentive without being overbearing
5
We had dinner last night in this restaurant to celebrate my husbands birthday and it was fantastic food! Had a drink outside on the terrace and then dinner inside in a cool air con room with good lighting, mirrors and a nice ambience. The burrata is the best I've had, the pork Milanese absolutely delicious, crispy pork snitzel it comes with a salad well dressed. The wines are terribly expensive though so beware! The service was fine, nice waiters who explained the menu. Overall a great find! We will definitely come back. Don't hesitate book and you will enjoy a fantastic Italian meal
5
Absolutely superb meal at Oso. Came here on the recommendation of someone who has been in Singapore many years and not disappointed at all! Service was wonderful from start to finish with friendly attentive staff - and as for the food, well maybe our new fav restaurant in SG
4
The setting for lunch was excellent and the food selection was good. Service was also discrete but prompt. Quality of food was also at a high level. I would recommend returning for other meals. Certainly good for business meals or with family and friends.
4
An ardent fan of Italian food, I am constantly scouring the city for really good Italian food...This restaurant is located quite close to the Dorset hotel, not too far from the centre of Singapore, maybe a 12-15 minute drive from Orchard. Nestled in a nondescript small building, it is a cozy place, yet it certainly is fine dining.If you like black truffles, they've got the best black truffle risotto I have had so far (the search is still on;-)) in this country! And apart from that, their ravioli, their pastas and their soups are all to die for!We typically order :The Buratta And a salad to start withAnd the main course Black truffle RisottoThe Pasta Arabiatta (made spicier then usual as per our request)The ravioliAnd we invariably have no place for anything but a tiramisu ...The owners are lovely.Always book a tableAnd don't sit near their passage to the kitchen, it has too must of a bustle to enjoy a nice meal...Have fun
4
This is a splendid Italian restaraunt in an old colonial style building in China town area and on top of,a Japanese eatery .such a melange is not on the menu which is quite quaintly Italian. The window,table,agile. View of the road scenes below.Great wine selection.The asparagus with cheese is,a,great starter and it gets better with each pick on the menu.,I found the fish consistently good
4
An Italian Chef, always around; a French MaÃ®tre D', omnipresent; a local brigade with little changes: it already bodes well!Coming from time to time and always pleasantly surprised. OSO holds and ages well. Ingredients are carefully selected and well kept from far Italy so taste as if local.Dishes are light and tasty. Wines are excellent, service could be a bit friendlier but Ok when you know how to deal with old timers brigade. All in all a very pleasant experience of a high end trattoria version. Let's face it Singapore has become an outrageously expensive place to live in; so is the food
4
The restaurant is at the 1rst floor of a lovely traditional house.It is warm cloured simple and with a view on the ham cutting machine in a glass room.I have always return to Oso over a 10 years periodTonight in the plate:White asparagus with 3 sauces: the asparagus were a bit hard and could have had more tasteFresh pasta with wild boar slowly cooked in red wine: gorgeous, deep, rich, round flavour with the texture of wide fresh pasta. FabulousWine by the glass: a delicious valponicella 2012Overall a beautiful address that always have a gorgeous dish for you.Sightly let down by the asparagus but it happen
5
When visiting my parents in Singapore, the last stop before flying home is always Oso! Why? Easy, always save the best for last. The food is incredible, the service is outstanding and the wine is delicious! Chef Chiarini is without a doubt one of the best in Singapore and Mr. Colleoni runs a tight ship with polite, friendly and knowledgeable staff! I look forward to my next visit
3
1 small plate of fettucine and 1 glass of red house wine incl. all taxes 65 S$ is even for Singapore a announcement......the food was tasteful but I was still hungry afterwards. Its quite noisy and if you wanna talk you have to shout.Staff is very friendly and attentive. Even I have to stay in this area in Singapore I will not go back to OS
4
We thoroughly enjoyed dinner at this restaurant. The restaurant has a lovely ambience and the service was excellent, even the owner made sure we were well looked after. The food was high quality and nicely presented, especially the strawberry carpaccio for dessert! We will definitely be back and will recommend this place to our friends
4
Came to Oso after it was recommended by a friend for my wife's birthday. We were not disappointed, the service was excellent and very personalized. Food was very tasty with plenty of choices. We would like to go back to experience the cheese room they have on premises. The outlet is a little hard to find, but maybe because we were rushing to make our reservation as we walked right pasted the door without notice.Great place, will definitely come back and recommend
5
Without a doubt the best Italian restaurant in town. In addition to having incredible food, the team that works at Oso truly sets the standard for what hospitality in Singapore should be. All in all it is a fantastic experience and one that I'd highly recommend
5
finally a real italian restaurant, with a great atmosphere, excellent service, fantastic food and an excellent wine list! We will be back for sure.
5
Delicious food, great drinks selection, excellent service and lovely ambiance. Prices are not cheap, but vey reasonable for the quality of the food. All in all a wonderful place to eat and can't wait to go back.
4
This restaurant I have been many times! On some occasions just on my own to be among the humans..
Genuinely good food and the service excellent. The waiters there are very experienced. My compliments to the manager.
4
Had dinner with a group of friends and the pasta's are one of the best I've had! Service was really good and a beautiful ambience for a night out!
5
The place is cosy and with great ambiance. Sometimes Italian restaurants could be very friendly but very noisy as well as people love to talk. Here it balanced really well. You could feel the energy and dynamic here, but you could still hear the one sitting opposite to you comfortably.The food especially the cold cut as its forte is fantastic. The ravioli I had is also very good with great cheesy smell and taste. Service is excellent and you could feel the warmth and it aligns with the atmosphere a proper Italian restaurant should have.I will come again
5
What can I say about OSO? The place stood right beside my hotel and it took me 8 weeks of being in Singapore to venture inside. The food was absolutely fabulous. The ambience was perfect, the staff were attentive and knowledgable without being overbearing. Superb, the best meal I have had in Singapore and from someone who normally avoids Italian restaurants because I normally find the food basic, that's saying something. Highly recommended, but you do pay for the luxury
5
Top Italian cuisine in ambient surroundings , equal to any top italian in eourope , best to book first , the prices were moderate , wine list superb and not overpriced . The service of course is impeccable , a noted restaurant away from thre tourist area 
4
A very nice place for a romantic dinner , special occasion.Very nice decor and subtle lighting create a very comfortable atmosphere for a wonderful meal.The staff are excellent and you never have to wait for assistance.Food was excellent. We dined here during restaurant week and we had a set 5 course meal.All very well prepared dishes , creative and delicious
5
Oso is a must visit for upmarket authentic Italian in Singapore.... Cosy and intimate, but with every table full of guests enjoying delicious Italian fare. They have a glass booth housing beautiful smoked meats and cheeses, which is freshly shaved to order. The generous plate of soft parma ham is to die for. Add to that Burrata made fresh daily - share a plate for 2. So good.The menu has plenty of authentic options, and for high quality like this, is reasonably priced. Choose the amazing crumbed veal chop and you will go home smiling.White table clothed and excellent personal service round off a good night
5
I'm completely blown away by OSO Ristorante. You've captured my heart, stole my taste buds and whisked us away to food heaven. I can't stop thinking about you and I can't wait to see you again.... Looking for Italian Food in a classy and comfortable space? Oso should be your go-to spot. Great for a date dinner, couples or even with parents
5
Excellent Italian food in the heart of Singapore. Service was friendly and outstanding. A little pricey on the meals and the wine, but worth it.
4
Booked the restaurant for important customers.
They accommodated our request to prepare sharing platters. The food was exquisite.
We were in the Billecart salmon room, which is very nice. Service was good too.
And there is a valet parking.
5
The restaurant was hard to locate due to an errant cab driver.
Once we got there - we entered a buzzing place which lived up to
it's reputation.
The starters & entree were all tasty and the desert was fabulous.
5
Went to OSO Ristorante for dinner. The atmosphere and decor is very nice. Greet by friendly staff as we arrived and taken upstairs to our table. The service from the waiters was very good. The food is authentic Italian and prepared by Italian Chefs. We thoroughly enjoyed our meal. We would definitely return to this fantastic restaurant on our return to Singapore. Thoroughly recommend this restaurant
5
I have been to OSO before and went back again after a few years. The food was good, wine list good but the best deal was the lunch set. For this quality food and service, it was really good. The chocolate dessert was superb......absolutely decadent but loved it

Went there for a quick lunch with my friend. Other than a little bit shaky service , the food was quite tasty. They served the quite authentic Italian food and the more imprtatnly it is very reasonably priced. This will be one of my favourite Italian restaurants in Si

A good Italian restaurant that with good food and great servicefood - we had the set dinner and the quality of the food is fresh and well executed. The complimentary bread platter itself was remarkable. Portion of the courses were reasonable.The dessert we had - Chocolate tart was the winner in my opinionService - 8/10. Attentive, and prompt - polite and not overbearing. Guest would feel welcome from the moment they step in till the moment they step out - great crewPrice - reasonable for the ambience and food quality. SGD55 for a 5 course dinner is considered reasonableThe only thing that missed a mark was the fact that the table was really small for 3 of us. It was in fact a table for 2 with an extra chair Would not hesitate to come back agai

The food at OSO is great. Service is good and thet have (for Singapore) a reasonable lunch course. Even the dinner options are not too expensive for what they offer you. Really nice atmosphere, the only thing I never liked about this place was the arctic air-con, bring a jacket!A bit difficult to locate if you have not been there. It is in a corner building, on top of a Japanese place that shares the same door
5
My first visit to oso was during the restaurantweek and I thoroughly enjoyed the food. Rate oso as one of the better restaurants that participated in restaurantweek. Went back to oso on several occasions after that and the food was good and consistent. strongly recommend to Italian food lovers!

Good Food, very friendly staff.The wild boar pasta is to die for. Writing this review is actually making me crave for that pasta.we had very noisy crowd next to ours, couldn't make much pleasant conversation. But then the friendly staff made up to it
5
Brought some serious clients for lunch, the food, service and wine list are world class - les class!! Thank you, no where in Singapore like Oso, it's like dining at home!
4
Had a business dinner in one of the private rooms and had a really good meal and service was excellent.
Staff very accommodating
4
Stylish atmosphere, very comprehensive wine list, excellent (al dente!) pasta, selection of fine cheeses, attentive staff, good overall price/value - I will be back! Note: It can get noisy.
4
Central, accessible location with a large, conducive space for lunch presentations. Reasonably priced. Could use larger portions though.
4
Located in one of the historical streets of Singapore. Bukit Pasoh is in Chinatown. Parking is a bit of a problem. Please use the valet. The staff were friendly, well trained and the food was good.
5
We had a lovely time celebrating my girl's 21st birthday. The cod with balsamic vinegar was excellent and so was the risotto with truffle oil. The bill was affordable too. But what I like best was that the restaurant staff was so attentive we felt their genuine appreciation. We would definitely go back again
5
I have eaten here half a dozen times and it never disappoints. Unpretentious but well presented, authentic, high quality food with a fairly priced wine list and a one for one policy. Service is always excellent. We were a party of 6 on a Thursday night with a great atmosphere. Everyone very happy
4
Love it that the team was so patient and helpful with our requests. We were a really rowdy bunch but the team was very nice and helped in any way they could. Even broke a few glasses but they were very understanding as well. Food was great though some felt the portion was a little smaller (Caucasians) but a large majority was really happy :)Will definitely be back
4
If I had not been staying in the Dorsett Hotel, I may never have come across this wonderful restaurant. My wife and I had a wonderful meal with our friends accompanied by some highly recommended and veery tasty bottles of wine (the recommendations made to accompany our dishes were spot on). The staff were very attentive and courteous and the meal.......... words cannot do this justice. Go and try for yourself and fork out a little extra at the end so you are able to go into the special "cheese room"
5
Had a wonderful meal at Oso. We enjoyed each of our 3 courses. The chef came to talk to us a few times which was nice. The ambience was lovely, service great. Would definitely come back. It's a very warm and welcoming place, suitable for romantic couples, business lunches/dinners, larger group bookings and friends catching up as was my case
5
This is a superb restaurant. Friendly, expert staff. A classic menu, and perfect preparation and presentation. A lovely place for a serious Italian dinner. Plan to relax, to eat well, and to enjoy the evening.
5
This place was awesome! Super friendly staff / extremely professional! The city was beautiful, clean and easy to get around and it smelled of beautiful flowers (the whole island!) We stayed 4 nights and five days.
4
Friendly staffs and excellent service throughout our dinner time there. We enjoy the atmosphere and food there, especially their dessert. Hope to visit again.
4
Great Italian food very authentic using fabulous Italian ingredients always a favourite of ours when we are in Singapore. Took the whole family and everyone loved it! Service and atmosphere excellent.
5
I decided to bring my partner to OSO to celebrate her birthday as the menu attracted me with various kind of nice foods and cheese.1st course - Seafood soup 2nd course - Black truffle risotto 3rd course - Cod fish / Roasted chicken with pork sausage4th course - 6 cheeses5th course - Panna Cotta / TiramisuWe really enjoyed the food and the services from start till end. Chef Diego came to our table and ensure everything is ok. The captain who take care of my table is friendly and always be there to make sure we have a pleasant dinner. The ambiance of the restaurant is perfect for couples who want to celebrate anniversary.Please do not hinder yourself from dining at this restaurant upon seeing the bad rating because you need to try it for yourself to experience the service and the quality of the foods.Will definitely return again
5
Not really a trattoria atmosphere here everything is more silent more organized, but the food is flawlessly good so even if like me you don't like this kind of cold ambiance and precious kind of food you feel obliged to say ..... It was bloody goo
5
After living 20 years in Singapore and dining out rather often, I think this is by far the best service and staff I've ever come across! Till the time you get off the car to the time you're seated in the table , you're welcomed wholeheartedly!! being a vegetarian, the food was amazing! So I can imagine what the meat eaters would be enjoying! Their burratta cheese screams freshness and their black truffle risotto is def a must try! Overall an awesome experience and I'll def go back
5
After a few trips to singapore for work, I brought my wife for her first visit. The first thing she researched was restaurants and OSO was at the top of her list. Everything we ordered was excellent. OSO's is a family owned restaurant. After we finished our meal, Sal graciously signed one of his cookbooks for my wife. By the time we left, we felt like family. We will certainly return to oso's anytime we are in singapore
5
I'd 'fess up first that the formal dining restaurant isn't my kinda scene. With that out of the way, I'd say that the food they serve here is really good- comparable to the likes of Italian formal dining back in the States. Service wise was attentive, and they've got a very good knowledge of their menu and wines. Thumbs up for that, cos I've been to so many places in Singapore where the staff are completely clueless
4
It's been about 5 or more years since i was last here and decided on this spot for lunch. The place was unexpectedly quiet so it can be good or bad. They have a set lunch menu for $26 which sounds like a great deal. We also ordered the parma ham starter to share. The parma ham was a generous portion and perfect for 3 of us. The melon tasted a little sour and wrong thoughFor the set, the prawn salad starter was ok. My pasta main was good, albeit a touch salty.My friends had the dish and meat and they seemed happy with those also. Dessert of panna cotta was ok. Portions were small, as you would expect from the price, so the parma ham was a good addition on hindsightService was ok, nothing of note.Overall probably a 3.5 score for lunch. A la carte may be a better gauge of how good this place can be. Or no
5
Very good italian restaurant ... great design, good service, very good wine list - fair prices; food served in excellent quality - highly recommended !
4
Wonderful experience!! Delicious food, excellent service and wonderful ambience. Highlight for dinner: Everyone is surprised and impressed with the sofa in the toilet within Azallan Room.
5
Tucked away in a beautiful street this restaurant ticks all the boxes. Taste, quality & service. We ordered 3 courses and each one was amazing. Better than any Italian we have had in Sydney. Unique & fresh pasta dishes. The Beetroot cake for dessert is a must! Price wise also good value for fine dining in Singapore. Staff were very helpful - approachable yet proffesional.
5
The quality of food in OSO is outstanding. It is simply a delight. Anybody who even vaguely likes Italian food should visit this restaurant. Fabulous pasta. beautifully cooked main courses. There were four of us having a business dinner on a busy Thursday evening but the service was attentive and very efficient.Ambience of the dining room is great and the layout makes you feel you are in an intimate space.Wine list whilst not extensive has some excellent value.Wonderful evening. Highly recommend to anybody wishing an excellent experience
5
Possibly the best Italian meal I've ever eaten - who would've thought I needed to go to Singapore to get it? Tripadvisor needs a 6th rating button to quantify just how good the food was. The service and atmosphere were excellent. I would highly recommend Oso
5
I had a great time at Oso tonight. I felt welcomed by the attentive and friendly service ("buona sera!"), and I liked the simple but tasteful decor.Food wasn't cheap as many visitors had pointed out. I ordered a roast pork belly ($34), it was paired with figs and tasted delicious. For the desserts, 3 of us ordered and shared the panna cotta with honey and caramelised pepper (about $12, I think) and a white chocolate and orange cake. I liked the cake, which was light and not too sweet. The panna cotta was firm and tasted mild. The honey wouldn't stick to it, so it didn't change the taste very much. Perhaps if they mixed the panna cotta with the pepper?Everything was beautifully presented. The servings were just nice for me, but then I'm a small eater. A big eater would possibly need to add an appetizer and dessert all to himself. Would return again, but only on days I feel like spoiling myself a bit
4
There is no doubt that Oso is a very good restaurant. The food is excellent, and prepared with much dedication by the Italian chef. He came by our table several times to check whether we enjoyed the food and everything was ok. That was a very nice touch. The waiter, however, could have been somewhat more interested and friendly, was a bit distanced and never showed a smile; this did not make a welcoming impression. Therefore, no full 5 points on the rating. (But maybe we were just unlucky that day.) The portion sizes differed quite a bit, depending on what dish you chose. Dessert portions were quite big in comparison with the main dishes. All in all, a pricey but enjoyable evening
3
Went here recommended by several persons but have to say it didn't even got close to my expectations. Despite having a long menu with different options I have to say all the dishes we ordered (one appetizer and two main dishes) came in very small portions served in huge dishes which made it look worse. Cocktails so-so, too light and pricey like everything in the menu. Must book before going, quite busy on w-e
4
Tasty food in small quantities at pricey level. Good choice with variety of dishes. Service OK but not quite what you expect at this price point. Noisy. Overall a decent Italian quiet corner of Chinatown, but not worth a long trip if you're not in the neighborhood.
5
Originally, i booked for Amarone, another Italian in the neighbourhood, however a colleague said this one was much better. ( no first hand experience with Amarone, so cannot judge there ). No regrets there! Every dish i had (vegetarian) was great. I felt sorry for myself that i only had one starter of the many choices i wanted. As a recommendation to the restaurant: would be nice to have little samples of each :)Afraid for an angry chef i didn't dare mentioning it. Bottles of wine range from 70 onwards. Nice many choices. As a main course i chose the black truffle risotto. While tasty, i was slightly dissapointed, but i can't quite name why. For dessert a hot chocolate cake. Suburb
5
Excellent food, even better service. Cant wait to go back. Such a shame they dont do pizza or I really would think I was in Italy.
4
Oso never disappoints.... Good food , good service and if you box clever a great meal for sensible price
5
A must go to in Singapore, if you like italian food.. Waiters are professional and the food and plating makes it worth every dollar...
5
Oso is a place i visit at least once everytime i take a trip to Singapore. The food is top notch, the service is excellent and all at a reasonable price.
4
Went with my girl for dinner on a weeknight.Both had linguine pasta, one with crab meat, the other with tomatoe and basil Pasta was very well done and al dente, ingredients very fresh and well prepared.Shared a Barolo Red which was very nice as well.The setting on the balcony is very pleasant and the inside seating seemed comfortable as well.Service was very friendly and efficient.All in all a good choice when in the area and looking for italian food
5
We were at a convention, and needed to entertain clients; we were recommended to OSO and we are so grateful. This restaurant is superb, magnificent food, beautiful wine list, attentive and fabulous service, reasonably priced for Singapore. we will always visit when in Singapore. our client thought it one of the best Italian meals they had experienced anywhere in the world. thanks to all the tea
5
Great lively buzzy atmosphere. The service was discreet but impeccable. We never felt being neglected even though it was a really busy night. The food was sumptuous, the white asparagus with bacon and pork belly dishes were particularly delicious. Wine selection was good. Overall good value for money. Will definitely go back again
5
I was lucky enough to be taken here for dinner last week on business and was blown away by the the quality of the food, the service and ambience/setting. My only disappointment was the venison option was not available which I had heard so much about (and in my experience, it's rare to find good venison here!) - had it been earlier in the week I could understand but by Thursday evening I'd expect the full menu to be available. I will definitely return though as overall this was a great premium Italian cuisine experience
5
We were so impressed with the service that we can say without a doubt that it was one of our best restaurant experience so far. What a great team and team work, we never felt "abandonned" by the staff and nor were they hovering. Kudos to the team. We had the Restaurant Week set menu and everything was delicious. We will definitely be back as soon as we want to do a special dinner and night out
5
Love love love this place. The ambience and service is impeccable. Last time we ate in the wine cellar (a closed off area for groups). They have other private dining as well as the main restaurant. Favorite dishes are: Gnocchi with gorgonzola and peas , The lamb always falls off the bone; pasta dishes are also very nice. We tend to go for selection of meats and cheeses for the starter.This is a restaurant for special occasions as not cheap but worth the cost
5
Delicious! I had the mushroom risotto and tasted the burrata appetizer - both amazing. We were there at lunchtime on a weekday - quiet at this time. There's a nice room in the back if you want to make a private booking.
4
visited in October for 5th time with Italian foodie friends. First time back in 18 months. In short.. it was brilliant and had the seal of approval from our friends. Spider Crab was awesome. Steak superbly cooked. Winelist and service excellent
5
Our first time here and it certainly won't be the last. This is truly Italian fine dining at its best. From the excellent service, to the best food, this has it all. Of note were any of the truffle dishes, the lobster and beef were in a league of their own. Great place, great ambience and awesome food!
5
Today we enjoyed an impeccable service at OSO with a group of 8 adults and one small child. Situated opposite our lovely hotel (New Majestic) in trendy Chinatown, the staff were great right from the start: they overheard me say that the airconditioning was very cold, and tuned the temperature up to a more convenient level. This is just an example of how attentive staff were, as they attended to all our needs without waiting for us to ask. The food was also lovely. For starters we had a gorgeous carpaccio, a plate of short cuts and a lovely spider crab. For mains I remember the mushroom and gorgonzola ravioli, a veal pasta and a wonderful crab pasta with the best creamy tomato sauce. The portions were perfect - not enormous and not too small and because everybody was raving about their own dish we ended up tasting from each other's plates...Some of us also ordered deserts, and these were absolutely worth it: a couple of the beautiful tiramisu and warm chocolate cake. The restaurant is a heritage building which is decorated with style and taste. We saw one of their separate rooms which holds about 6 people, all 4 walls are full of bottles, which is worth booking.The gorgeous food, lovely wine, beautiful setting and extremely attentive and discreet service made that we considered it great value for money. We had a great night!Highly recommendable
4
I had a business lunch at OSO taking the $48++ set menu; both the food and the service were excellent. The restaurant is set just off Eu Tong Seng with valet parking available and a public carpark a 100m walk away off the main street. The lobby is very funky with some large sculpture pieces and a discreet wooden staircase taking you above the Japanese restaurant on the ground floor. I started with the cauliflower soup with herring roe - creamy and and rich with a salty element from the caviar. My friends had the mushroom soup. Main was the veal cheek with mash. The mash was a little watery but the veal cheek was cooked to perfection and very tasty. One of the party had the risotto which was a large helping and the other had a delicate piece of cod.I closed with the 70% cocoa chocolate mousse with caramelised figs, which was perfect. The figs balanced the very indulgent mousse nicely. The waiting staff were friendly. My only complaint was that our table was quite close to the one beside us so it wasn't very party for us or for the four men beside us
3
We had a group dinner [20 persons] in this restaurant. The restaurant building is very nice, it was an old house, which was turned into a business place. After going through some corridors, we reached the reserved room. This was relatively nice. The wait staff did not seem to know what they were doing. They did not know that there's a washroom connected to our dining room. They did not bring a drink menu when asking us what drinks we would like to order. In the menu, it showed "Fresh fruit juice". The waiter informed us that they had nothing fresh, they only had drinks that were fresh from the bottles. Our expectations slowly but surely decreased. As part of the set menu, each of us was served a platter of 9 kinds of antipasti. The next antipasti was risotto. This was the first time we had crunchy risotto. The flavor was fantastic, but it's undercooked. The platter was tastefully decorated. For the main course, there were 2 options, grilled beef tenderloin or pan fried fish. Those who ordered grilled beef tenderloin didn't have a choice. Everyone would be served medium-cooked beef. The fish was quite delicious. Lastly, each of us was served a platter of 5 kinds of desserts. The desserts were fantastic. Overall conclusion, the fine dining was costly but was not accompanied by the fine quality
3
A nice room and promising menu failed to live up to the descriptions and high prices.A fair rucola salad was followed by a tough veal chop swamped by ludicrous amounts of tasteless small tomatoes.Some limp fried potatoes added to the overall disappointment.A nice chef appeared both before and after the meal.My guest asked the waiter to recommend something but he could not suggest anything.Overall this was really a poor dining experience where the staff and chef seemed in denial.Not worth the money and not to be revisited
5
We went for dinner and order the cold cuts, the fresh ravioli, the black truffle and eggs and the white chocolate and orange cake among other things - it was all perfect. We cleared the plates. I think that speaks for itself. We'll definitely be back for more. To people who complain about the cost: fine dining is never cheap. Go to a food court if you are worried about the prices. It may be expensive but it's still good value

i) Average Italian food. When I go to an Italian restaurant (or ristorante, if you insist) and even the basic spaghetti with tomato sauce lets you down, there is not much left to swoon about. Another entree was roast chicken with stuffed sausage came on a bed of mushrooms, and it was average too. ii) Service is impeccable. My husband and I said we would share the entrees, so the chef was kind of to plate the dishes by half. The presentation of the food is beautiful. iii) Portion sizes are quite small. It is housed in a very pretty part of Chinatown,It seems to be a popular place for big gatherings, so it was noisy on the weekend. Fortunately we got a table on the balcony with a view of the full moon, so it was romantic. Now, if only the food would match up.If you are looking for a fine dining Italian experience, surely Singapore has other options. I would recommend looking elsewhere
4
With both kids away this was a special Date Night venue. Food exquisite and service impeccable. Tucked behind Dhoby Ghaut MRT this is really convenient to get to too. My husband has been here several times on business but I think it will become a personal fave too. Can't really comment on the ambiance as it had only just opened (6.30pm) so was not exactly buzzing
3
I used to like a lot after overwork although food isn't that good. Now it's little bit noisy at the restaurant with big group which spoils the ambience and I stop going unfortunately.
5
Superb decor, attentive but overbearing service and truly excellent food. Cheeses, meats, wines and many others imported weekly from Italy.
5
Oso Ristorante was recommended to me as the best Italian restaurant in Singapore. Having enjoyed it once before, I took a colleague there when on a business trip recently. A significant number of the staff are Italian and there is a real Italian atmosphere. The restaurant is in a beautiful old building in Chinatown in Singapore. The décor, however, is distinctly Italian. The food was excellent and the Italian Chef came by to speak with us, as did the owner. The Maitre D was also very attentive and helpful. The wine list was quite extensive with many world wines with a great selection of Italian wines. Prices range from the very reasonable (less than $100) to the stratospheric ($5,000). The low to mid range wines make up the bulk of the list and I was very pleased to see well over a dozen reasonably priced Barolos - my favourite Italian wine. Of course, the Barolos also featured at the top end of the list, which has several pages of variety to keep the connoisseur happy.The restaurant is popular, but we got a table for two at 7 O’clock on the Thursday before the Formula 1 without booking! The dining experience was really top level, finishing with great deserts, great coffee and a fine brandy. An excellent find
4
Cool, clean and comfortable, with elegant decor. This tasteful Italian restaurant is situated in a lovely building, upstairs, with indoor and outdoor options. The atmosphere is relaxed, a happy balance of liveliness without excessive din. The waitstaff is attentive but discreet. It features a cheese room, a respectable wine list and excellent seasonal offerings
5
I was in Singapore on a business trip and I went to Ristorante OSO with friends after hearing rave reviews about it. I was not disappointed. Beautifully appointed with a warm, cosy, welcoming and friendly atmosphere. Attentive staff who were always discreetly in the background. I did not find it overbearing at all.Food was simply superb. A wonderful selection of anti-pastas followed by linguine with crab - the best I have ever had. Main course was double breaded veal chop. Simply perfect. OSO's veal is all imported from Holland and was so good. A great cheeseboard finished off the wonderful meal. To sum up then, if you are looking for a cosy warm welcoming Italian restaurant where you feel special them this is a place you must try. Add in the simply superb food and you are on to a winner
4
the place, upstairs, has been finely decorated. you seat in a beautiful, pleasant, and relaxed atmosphere. it is not noisy, and there is plenty of room between tables.the service is adequate.there is an extensive list of wines. and the one we had, a pinot grigio, reasonably priced, was excellent. the food is good without being outstanding. not the best italian food I have had in singapore, but it is quite ok. all in all, although not a must, a place worth trying
4
This is a nice, warm cosy place to bring friends for a nice dinner. Lively atmosphere with friendly service, though their service can be improved with more attention to details (e.g. I was served with a stained wine glass, which could have been avoided). Nice ladies washroom too! Equipped with basic necessities that a lady needs!I find their food is nothing to shout about. My friend ordered the sea bream and for me, baby lobster linguine. Pasta wasn't al dente, IMHO. Nevertheless, definitely loved the ambience
4
Went to OSO for dinner with couple of friends, one being an Italian. Service was great, the reception actually met us on the curb as we got out of the cab and greeting us by name. the restaurant manager and the chef also came out to serve us. Everyone was so attentive. The food was excellent, my Italian friend seemed to love it. The restaurant is located on the 2nd floor in a beautiful old building in Chinatown, probably used to be a shop house before they renovated it. We took the table on the balcony and enjoy the view of the old neighborhood. I regret that I didn't peek into their cheese room
4
Located in a pretty building, with the option of indoor dining and on a balcony. A cheese room, valet service and a good menu which had both seasonal specials and an extensive menu. It was a special evening with good food. It was difficult to choose what to have with so many great options, but not to worry the portions are not that large so one is able to have a few varieties. The staff also amend orders in sizing, which is really great if you would like a bit of everything. In addition we were given plenty of attention in explaining the menu or individual dishes, with advise on which wines would go best with our meals. Throughout the evening the staff including the head Chef and restaurant manager circulated throughout the evening greeting guests and ensuring all were satisfied. We both had pasta dishes to start, one with truffles and the other sausages, the taste was exquisite. Followed by a whole baked fish and another dish of grilled scallops. Which were some of the best scallops I have ever had. The fish is shown to you and then taken away to be filleted, unfortunately when it came back it was cold. We finished our meal with a traditional tiramisu and chocolate flan, both perfect. I had heard this is one of the best restaurants in Singapore, I would certainly classify it as fantastic, worth a visit or two, if not more to get through that amazing menu
5
Really cool Italian restaurant , i believe the best in Singapore !Located in a very nice renovated house , with a bar , balcony , cheese room , private dinning room and cigar room .Exciting menu , extensive wine list and really efficient and friendly service .The food is really excellent and the ambiance is great . Good value especially during lunch 
3
Nice desserts. Acceptable ambiance. Attentive staffs.
Good if you're going during the Singapore restaurant week!
5
Entertained close friends for lunch. Great value for money, great staff and brilliant food. 3 course lunch served in style. Well done

This was my first time in Oso and the location and ambience creates great expectations. We first had some cocktails at the bar before proceeding to dinner. The barkeeper was very friendly and he did mix good drinks. They do have a great wine selection as well and we were very satisfied until that part of the evening. The menu looked interesting with a good choice of meats, fish, pasta, starters, specials and dessert. I had the burrata cheese as a starter and unfortunately wasn't too impressed. It didn't look very fresh and the taste of this usually delicious mozzarella was somewhat distorted by the accompanying sauce and too many cherry tomatoes.Unfortunately my main course (Ossobucco) didn't make up for it either. Extremely bland taste both the meat and the puree on the side. A bit disappointing at that stage.Even the friendly and good service or dessert (chocolate tart) didn't help dispersing the thought that there are better Italian restaurants in this city. We did have a few bottles of wine, but I paid similar for much better food.Hope they keep working on their food quality. It's a real nice place otherwise

10 of us had booked one of the function rooms for a farewell dinner in June.The night started off well here. We were ushered into the room (just as well as it is a rabbit warren to the function rooms up various stairs and we would have struggled to find the room), to find a lovely, whisky-themed room, with a bar-man waiting for us. He was very knowledgeable and helpful and got us our drinks very fast.The newly renovated restaurant has only been open a few weeks and the decor is awesome. The HUGE truffle on display as you walk up the stairs is impressive!We had asked for a set menu, with a good selection of 'degustation' type tasting dishes and main courses. They looked great.The waiter started off very well, took our orders swiftly and the food arrived quickly.The selection of the dishes was great; we tried the degustation type starter, with 9 different starters on each plate. They were good, ranging from parma ham, to caviar, crab cakes and many others. Good start.The mains were not so good. The waiter claimed 'medium-rare' and 'medium' tenderloin were the same thing, for example. When the dishes arrived, they were a little disappointing. The tenderloin was under-seasoned and the chicken over-salty.Desserts were, again, good, with similar tasting dishes available and the restaurant was flexible enough to allow one of us to select only one of the desserts on the tasting dish.I was disappointed after dinner, as we relaxed, chatted and enjoyed some more wine and were looking forward to cocktails and Scotch.However, the waiter disappeared and I had to walk downstairs to find him, chatting to his friends.Overall, a good, if variable experience and I may well return, to try as a diner in a smaller party, in the main room
5
Shamed to say I have been in Singapore for 6 years and only just found this place. Great food, great service, no hideous bill. Wines are nice and very affordable. Staff extremely helpful on menu selections and getting taxi at end of evening. And they iron the beautiful white table linen on the tables when they set up a table. If you like Italian food and don't want to pay stupid amounts to people playing at running a restaurant - come to this very professionally run place. Stylish as well. Can't say enough about how impressed we were (me and my wife)
4
Oso is a lovely Italian restaurant situated on the second floor of an old refurbished building will lots of character off Tanjong Pagar. The decor inside is modern and stylish in contrast.Service is impeccable from the time you enter the restaurant. For us it actually started outside as we were greeted warmly by the owner. Food is really good. We had two starters, steak and fish mains and a dessert all yummy. Wine list is extensive. We ordered a bottle for s$88, probably one of the cheapest, but produced by Gaya and great value for money. Total bill for 3 including wine was s$345 and We were happy to pay it!Definitely will go back. If you're planning to go at the week end you need to book. If was absolutely full when we went

Was there when they were renovating the second storey where the Italian restaurant is. We will seated in their upcoming Japanese restaurant at the ground floor instead. Spanking new, but the layout is Japanese, so no point commenting on it. The service was good, but on the surface. Yes, they greet you and guide you to your seat, there are Italian accent men in suit asking you how is the food from time to time, but its good, not unique or outstanding to talk about. Why I really meant its on the surface because the waiter who served us was not up to par. For instance, I asked him to introduce me the menu and told him I am looking for one appetizer and one salad, he recite all the dishes on the menu , giving me no space to query about the dishes he recited. I would have read it myself if I want to know what is on the menu. I only got a chance to stop him after the 4th page of the menu and I still have no clue what is good in their menu. What is an added touch I should give credit to them is they acceded to my request to do something special for the dessert as it was my wife's birthday. They did, with a hand written birthday greeting in Italian and a candle on the tiramisu. Thanks for that. Food-wise, we had the spidercrab Granchio salad, wild Rucola salad, mushroom soup and seafood soup, linguine with clams , a fettuccine with lobster and tiramisu. The appetizers and salad are forgettable , the soups are not good. Especially the seafood food, which has bitter aftertaste of wine overcooked. The linguine was better than the fettuccine and the dessert is the saving grace. Spent about $145 for two pax which is decent for two at a mid range Italian restaurant . Will consider going again, but not any time soon as we would try other places first

I had heard a lot of great things about Oso and it really lived up to my expectations. The restaurant is currently under renovation and we ate in the Japanese restaurant space downstairs. The food was simply delicious and the presentation classy. The pasta with white asparagus and truffle was to die for and the quality of the steak incredible: juicy, tender and cooked to perfection. And do not skip the dessert !I have not tried many Italian restaurants in Singapore but so far this is my favorite

I went there on the last day of the Singapore Restaurant Week, and after a fantastic experience at Salt Bar and Grill we were hoping to end Restaurant Week on a high note. I'm sad to say that it was not so. The restaurant opened its doors at 6PM sharp, for our 6PM reservation. We were seated quickly, the menu was waiting on the table, but the server didn't really explain how it worked. I asked and they explained I only have to choose between fish or duck for the main course--they will serve everything else.The $55++ set dinner looked promising at first, and we were expecting at least healthy portions like we got at Salt, but it seems Oso takes the "tasting portion" concept a little too seriously. Everything was indeed served in tiny portions. The trio of appetizers were served on one plate: a spoonful of tuna tartare, a spoonful of mozzarella tartare with pesto, and a small slice of slow-cooked pork belly. The tuna was fresh but a little underseasoned, mozzarella was very tasty, the pork belly was cold and grey and tender to the point of crumbling, so it was like eating a morsel of zombie flesh.The cauliflower soup with Avruga caviar was a strange combination. Drowning the caviar in humble cauliflower kind of spoiled the effect, and prevented any enjoyment of the caviar. It was lukewarm and rather bland. We had 3 spoonfuls of soup out of each bowl. Tagliatelle with cheese and truffle sauce came next, and was the best of the lot. The pasta was freshly made and cooked perfectly al dente, and the sauce was rich with truffle shavings. I wish there was more of it (actually this should have been the main course). This was 2 mouthfuls of pasta.My duck main course gave me the impression I was getting a duck leg, but I got mashed potato mixed with some pulled duck meat. I couldn't even tell which part the duck meat came from. There was maybe 1.5 spoonfuls of mash and a spoonful of duck. The orange gremolata sauce was undetectable. I literally groaned after I finished it because I was still hungry.My friend's sea bass fillet was more, 1/3 of a fillet. It was pitifully tiny. It came with 4 cherry tomatoes. That's all. The squid ink sauce made the whole plate look like a messy oil spill.The dessert was "dark chocolate soup" which was part chocolate cake, part melted chocolate. It felt like a lava cake that didn't quite hold up. Thankfully it was tasty, I think, couldn't really tell because there was just not enough of it.We also ordered a $68++ bottle of sauvignon blanc which was quite decent, if nondescript. Service was attentive.The restroom was whiffy and there were no paper towels in the dispenser. The bill came to $88 per person, for not much (average) food and two glasses of wine. Not much value for money even for Restaurant Week

We went to Oso to celebrate our friends birthday and the food was absolutely fresh and outstanding. The service staff are very attentive and gracious and we had a great time. You must order the hot dark chocolate tart if you are a chocolate lover. it's amongst the best I have ever eaten. The seafood is very fresh and cooked to perfection. My friends had risotto and pasta and they were just he right portion size and very yummy. must go if in Singapore. I'm a local and I go back there many times and its always packed.
4
Fresh products and very nice atmosphere.
one of the owners had a nice talk with us and took the time to salute most of the guest.
overall very satisfied.
5
great place with excellent Italian food (make sure you leave some space for the desserts!) and wine selection, very friendly and helpful staff and modern atmosphere! If the restaurant is full it is quite noisy but that's what restaurants in Italy are as well ;-)!
4
Had a business lunch for 4 pax. Reasonable 3 courses set lunch at Sin $39 each. Loved the homemade pasta and dessert. Quiet and fairly decent wine selection. Will definitely revisit.
5
They help to customize our set dinner for a group of 20 persons with almost everything so that we can taste all the signature dishes .... Foie gras, Boston lobster, ravioli, fish, soup, beef, Parma ham, pasta with truffle etc......
1
A friend recommended this restuarant for our usual couple outing and after reading all the good reviews, I was also looking forward to the dinner. As the font on the menu was too small to read.. we decided to just go with the $98 to save us some efforts and time so as to enjoy our wine.The menu has 5 courses, prawns with beetroot, funghi pasta with parmigiano cheese, seabass on bed of asparagus, wagyu beef tenderloinwith foe grais, dessert is some chilli chocolate pot with scoop of ice cream. Sounded great isn't it.... but that is as far as it goes.Look:I think they have seriously gone overboard in the plating the dishes, trying to be very different and bold in a very low class manner, the tenderloin resembles some crime scene as seen with the cranberry sauce splatters over the mashed fig, which looks like a brain and all over the corpse... ie, the foe grais and the beef, the pathetic,and ice cream served in a cored huge tomato .... how nice can it get ? Pizza hut can do better.Taste:1) Prawns - tasteless pouched frozen shrimps with beet root, rose petal, caviar, .. this combination is rather " interesting" for the taste bud, as they do not complement, do not contrast each other at all...same comment from all 4 of us..."WEIRD ". 2) Tagliolini with funghi sauce - pasta is soggy. not even firm let alone al dente. - sauce so-so. nothing to shout about... just a cream sauce3) Seabass on bed of asparagus - the pan fried fish is limp, weak and and tasted unfresh. maybe the fishmonger was not open during CNY. the asparagus, is a very chinese Tz char sauce, , clear sauce with some chopped herbs with msg and olive oil4) Beef tenderloin with foe grais - this dish top it all, the beef is as though they have boiled it for soup, then tenderize with tons of acid and then pan fried. very mushy and tasteless.. The foe gras is dry and tough and tasteless. 5) the chilli chocolate pot with ice cream served in warm cut tomato is a joke - the chocolate pot is eye opener, never had i tried this kind of gluey chocolate paste, like some uncooked chocolate cake dough. The melting ice-cream in a warm tomato is just too much for us... The chilli chocolate... is also a disaster.... instead of just adding a tint of spiceness... it has totally changed the taste of chocolate... into some strange taste... no taste of chocolate at all.... just weird taste again...made worse with the bad consistency of the chocolate. another failure in trying to experiment too many new ideas in one dish.I was so inspired to write this review as it has been a very very long time that I had dinner with all 5 courses that taste like crap. It is not easy you know. Normally, they are just so-so or one of the dish will certainly be pleasing... but not tonight.... Not sure if they have some problem with costing on the menu as they try to impress with ingredients "called" caviar, foe gras, wagyu beef or perhaps they try too hard to impress their guest with their extra unnecessary efforts in the plating. To be honest, this meal is like some juvenile chef is experimenting with their first dishes and also using all the unfresh ingredients. I would appreciate more if they offer a simple pasta al pomodoro done with heart, or spaghetii aglio olio served al dente, or simply a fresh piece of fish pouch in butter. And not spending time dressing up unfresh expensive ingredients and making it look 'glamourous and busy' and ignored the basics of making the food taste good. My husband gave them the benefits of doubt that perhaps only the set dinner is lousy, and that the ala carte items might be good. But I told him that if any chef could allow those dishes to leave their kitchen, he can't be any good and would not be a chef with any passion. Perhaps the chef is on leave today.....Anyhow, all 4 of us concurred that this has to be the lousiest meal in the past years and felt that the good wine we brought was terribly wasted, which would probably taste better with a $4 nasi briyani . Nevertheless, this would remain as a very memorable meal for the rest of our lives as I think it is going to be very hard for any restaurant to beat their record of all 5 crap dishes being served in the same meal with not a single merit found. Oh, service is good though and San pellegrino is great ! BTW, Just a note of caution on all the good reviews you have read...

Been back to Singapore there for the Chinese New Year and suddenly I feel the need of some pasta ... hard life to be Italian , believe me ! So we went to this restaurant and was definitely a nice experience . Ambient is casual-chic and the restaurant was fully packed , a good sign normally . Service was "Italian style" with friendly and professional waiters and the new manager , truly Italian , just arrived from a previous restaurant in London . Food wise all was the way you expect to be : antipasto with the Burrata cheese was a tasty start , then the pasta "angel hair" with bottarga was a tasteful flashback to Sardinia for my GF . She also wanted to give a try to the fish as main course , I decided to listen to my DNA and went for an Ossobuco . Both the choices were nice . Then a shared dessert , espresso and a gently offered limoncello were the gran finale . If you want to eat Italian here in Singapore this OSO should be on your mobile phone

I've been to Oso a few times now over the past year, and I am always impressed with the attention the staff give you. From the welcome at the door to the waiter at the table, their customer service is first class. I went with a group of last week to celebrate a birthday of a friend. We had the table In the wine cellar which was really novel. I had suggested and booked the restaurant, my friends never having been before, and all were very impressed with the menu selection. We had a great night and we will definitely be back.
5
I love OSO - this place is consistently good. Food is very nice, the service is among the best in Singapore, the wine list is great and the ambience is just fantastic. The place is excellent for both business and casual, including bringing your wife or a group of friends. Pricing is also very reasonable for what it is. Further, I like the fact that the place is not dead by 10pm as other restaurants in Singapore. Highly recommended (especially in the white truffle season!)
4
We've been there thrice,we tried almost everything in the menu and also others which are not in the menu,they are all flavoursome. From cold cut platter to pasta to mains. Service was good. For couples,It's best to come early as the restaurant gets busy and very rowdy by 8pm
4
Food was very tasty, some of the best Italian food I've had outside of Italy. The cold cuts selection that are offered as starters are very tasty but lacking any accompaniment: a giant plate of cured bacon is good for the first few bites, but after that it's just bacon on a plate (hence why 4 not 5 stars).Pricing was very reasonable for food...starter, main, desert came to SGD 220 for 3 people. Drinks added another SGD 200. Service was efficient and discrete, ambience was good though possibly a little formal for shorts (I felt a little underdressed in mine!
5
By far the best italian restaurant in my opinion. You pay for it but it is worth it. nice bar downstairs and a great little cigar room. valet parking and away from the crowds
5
This is simply the best Italian restaurant in Singapore. Incredible value for money. I love the cold cut and the wide selection of cheese, but don't worry they have a lot more to offer.
Service is perfect.
And atmosphere excellent, trendy but relaxing
4
Very very difficult to fault this place, except that location is slightly out of the way (though not hard to walk from Outram Park MRT if you can't get a cab. Good competent service and plenty of choice from the menu including some slightly unusual recipes. For example I started with rabbit rigatoni - not something you typically come across on an Italian menu in this part of the world, yet at the same time I would think quite faithful to the style of some Tuscan or Umbrian cuisine. Ossobuco main course was also very good. Good choice of wines by the glass as well as bottle
4
We arrived and as per normal in Singapore at this time of year it was raining. We were immediately greeted by the restaurant staff bearing umbrellas. We were escorted up stairs and shown to our table. The staff were very warm and welcoming un like the freezing cold air conditioning ! However the waiter noticed our shivers and offered the ladies pashminas and to turn down the AC. Both were great fully accepted. We ordered a bottle of champagne which was very reasonably priced by Singapore standards and took our time enjoying a couple of glasses before ordering. The staff were extremely professional and did not rush us and were happy for us to take our time. Oso has a fantastic cold cut cured meat selection on display in a glass cold room in the heart of the restaurant, so it was an easy choice for starters. We had a selection of mains including fish and meat and all dishes were exceptional and beautifully presented. The wine list was again well stocked and reasonably priced. We enjoyed a couple of bottles ! We skipped dessert but had coffee. The whole evening was great and the bill very fair. Defiantly on the list to return too
5
I patronizes Oso several times in the last two weeks. It is probably, without doubt,one of the best Italian Restaurant in Singapore. The service is fast and the food is great! The Pastas are very well done, and mains courses as well. There, I ate the best ministrone and the best carrot soup.If you like cheese, inside the cheese room (and cold cuts too!) which is clean as a surgery room, there are dozens of cheeses to satisfy your palate. Oso reminds me the old Italian Trattoria in Tuscany........well done!!!
4
I've been dining at Oso for a couple years now and have always found it to be consistantly good. Creature of habit so I always have the wild boar pasta, its splendid. The restaurant can get quite noisy and the service isn't as polished as i remember, but will still come back
5
TA restaurant ratings for Singapore lack credibility. I would rate this among the top for Italian in Singapore, out of many many good and authentic ones we have. Very consistent and among all your typical northern Italian dishes make sure to try the antipasti of cured meats and burrata salad if available
3
OSO is cool, great design although the first level is a waist of space. Excellent service, the food was good-ok, a bit small size dishes, the major problem is the acoustic - the place is very noisy! To a level it is hard to have nice conversation. The food is a bit expensive and the wine was really over priced
4
It was my sister's birthday dinner and we picked the restaurant for the many wonderful reviews we have read. True to our expectations, the food was excellent. It was the Singapore Restaurant Week and there was a set 5-course menu for $55++ which, taste aside, was also great value. Each course was excellent. My favourite dish was the tagliatelle w cheese fondue. The baby peach with white truffle was a lovely touch. Our waiter was probably one of the best waiters I have met in Singapore. He was very polite and attentive. He noticed that my sister took less than a quarter of the cauliflower timbale w caviar. I was impressed that he took the effort to find out why, and asked if my sister wld like alternative dishes even though it was a fixed set menu. The replacement was a nice spinach with pinenut salad. This flexibility and service really set OSO apart from many other restaurants. We had made a booking online at 845pm as that was the only timing available to us on the Restaurant Week website. We arrived super early at 720pm and thought we would try our luck to see if the restaurant has tables available. We were glad to be offered a table and on that count, we were grateful for the flexibility and efficiency that OSO offered. It saved us a good bit of time for the evening
4
We were looking for a quality Italian eatery and came across OSO. I was intrigued by the eagerly positive critiques from both local Patrons and visitors with a substantial number of reviews under their belt, so we decided to give it a try, even if it was not closest to our hotel.It was definitely time well spent. The house was packed (Restaurant Week in Singapore), but we were taken care of with utmost speed, efficiency and care. When we found out later that many in the staff have been working with the Partners (Diego in the kitchen and Stephane managing the floor) for more than 10 years, we quickly understood why.Food was very good in general, despite some glitches that, without being dramatic (packed house?), make it miss an "Excellent" rating this time. Before carrying on, let me just say that I will DEFINITELY return to this restaurant:-Cold cuts were out of this world: Mortadella was soft and velvety, Speck very thinly cut and full of aroma, Parma Ham melted in your mouth. The Bread they were served with was excellent too, and it kept coming for as long as you needed it.-Insalata Caprese had excellent mozzarella cheese and a very nice touch by means of a tomato-garlic sauce similar to Spanish Salmorejo . However, the "forgotten half" of this particular Caprese, the tomatoes, were tasteless and hard to the bite. A missed opportunity, even if the overall result was quite convincing.-Fetuccine Carbonara: They were not on the menu, but our waiter said "yes we can do it" less than one second after I inquired. They were excellent, except that they were quite salty. I can only imagine that Asian Customers, with a taste developed for much softer flavors, would have had a tough time eating those (I however finished mine without further complaints).-Tiramisu: For aficionados, Tiramisu is a bit like soccer: There are as many theories about how to make good Tiramisu as people trying to make it. While there was nothing downright wrong with Tiramisu at Oso, it did not make it home to my "Yummy" department. Their recipe might have been adapted to the Asian taste (less cheesy, less egg yolk or cream), but the result was a bit tasteless as a consequence.Bottom line: Far from being "your average neighborhood Italian", out-of-this-world service, great ingredients and solid cooking make Oso a worthwhile stop in restaurant-packed Singapore. We will definitely return outside of restaurant Week and I'm sure we'll enjoy it thoroughly again

The food was worse than average. The service was insincere and the place was filled with annoying people.
5
Had dinner again here last Friday.It's a fantastic Italian restaurant and probably in my Top 5 of Singapore restaurants! This time we ordered the 1kg côte de bœuf which was grilled with rosemary and served rare. The best beef I've had this year!Oso is owned/managed by Stephane Colleoni and he is the perfect host.See you soon!Gratzi
5
We have dined many times at Oso's and always thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The decor, the ambiance, the menu, the freshness of the ingredients, the wine list and the very friendly staff make this restaurant a must dine. I particularly enjoy visiting the cheese room to pick a selection of very mature cheeses to enjoy at the end of my delicious experience
4
Had the pleasure to attend an event at this restaurant. Impeccable service, great (superb) food. Nothing went wrong (except perhaps the aircon which could not service the crowd on level 1 for pre dinner drinks)! i would thoroughly recommend you try it if you dont mind paying a bit more in Singapore for this sort of cuisine
5
I went here for a special anniversary dinner. It is set in Duxton which is known for its eateries. It is in a lovely shop house on a corner set amongst boutique hotels and restaurants. As you walk in the bar area is a very cool place nice seats at lighting. There is a little room where you can smoke cigars! The dining room is upstairs and decorated in blacks and silvers. There is a huge glass walk in wine fridge and a smaller one where they keep cured meats. Some people may think the dinning area is a little crowded but the atmosphere here is lively and buzzing. It is not one of these places where you are afraid to talk. I loved it for the atmosphere but the best part was obviously the food. I enjoy eating fine dining quality food but I enjoy it more in an environment which is exciting and buzzing which in my opinion Oso is
5
I have experienced many italian restaurants in Singapore but this is really the very best , very wide menu , everything excellent , superb choice of wines, even by the glass.very warm service . The only negative point : it tends to be very noisy . Reservation required : it is always ful
5
Oso is a rare treat - a tuly authentic and fine dining experience in SIngapore. Granted it is not cheap, but when you tastes the flavours, the quality and freshness of the ingredients and you combine this with the quality of service - something tuly italian in that real pride is taken in serving the customers - you realise why So many rave about OsoThere is an attention to detail, an uncompromising focus on quality and authenticity matched by a substantial wine list.A place for business, yet someohow still a place on a romantic date. Great ambience, great atmosphere of cossetted luxury and indulgenceStill my favourite restuarant in Singapore and I suspect it will be hard to budge it from thereDfientley try the BUrrata, the foie gras, the Osobuco, the gnocci, the Seasbass and the cheese selectio

We booked more than 2 weeks in advance for the French Restaurant. We confirmed through our hotel concierge on the reserved day and, although we arrived 15 minutes before the booked time, we had to wait more than 50 minutes to be seated because the restaurant saw our reservation at first, but then "lost" it, and had forgotten that we were waiting in the lounge. It seems that they really didn't honour the reservation seated someone in our place and when we arrived there was no tables anymore, instead, they offered us the Italian Restaurant – OSO,. Not very nice, but everything would be OK if the food were good. We should have leaved at this point but, as this restaurant had been so well reviewed, we insisted to stay. Finally, we were seated near a table with a completely drunk guy (he had to be carried after the meal) and the food came. It was a TOTAL disappointment. Pretentious, not savory, not harmonic. We were hungry, the portions were small, but we could not eat the whole food since it was so bad. I let half of my foie gras (almost completely raw, arghh!) and had no wish to eat the chocolate served at the end of the meal ( I'm a chocolate addicted!). Another letdown was the desert menu. The best part of the meal was the bread. We are foodies and, when travelling, we like to spend our money eating well. If you want really nice service and good food, prepared with expertise, go to another pace like Guy Savoy…This chain of restaurants is overrated We had lunch and pre-theater menu on Cafe Boulud had excellent meals.
5
We have been to this restaurant twice in the last month and thoroughly recommend it. Both visits were on a Saturday evening and on both occasions we were impressed from the moment we arrived as we were greeted with a smile and warm welcome, which is not something you always experience!!This is a fantastic restaurant for all occasions - romantic meal for two, entertaining clients or a large group of friends and family. The atmosphere is formal but relaxed and the ambience is spot on. The menu has an extensive selection of both food and wine, and it was particularly good for me as a vegetarian - at least three starter and main course choices which is unusual for a more expensive restaurant where vegetarians can often be neglected! Everything was reasonably priced - you can have a pasta for $25, but equally there are more expensive options like caviar, steaks etc.We paid about $350 for 3 starters to share, 2 mains, 2 desserts, 5 glasses of wine and a beer including extras like bread and water
5
Awesome staff, food, wine and atmosphere.Been back twice since and still a great standard.Recommend for a range of occassions, especially surprising your partner with a great meal, location and atmosphere.Next time I go I wanna try the cigar bar downstairs!Be prepared to Pay for it, not the cheapest nights out but worth the splurge on qualit
4
Great service, great quality of food. We were pleasantly surprised by how good this place was. The braised pork was delicious and the dessert fantastic. A bit expensive though.
4
Food is absolutely amazing, service is good. However it is really pricey (~$100 per head -main&1starter, no wine)
4
Visited on a midweek evening. The restaurant was busy but service was still reasonably quick. I tend to prefer Italian being served as a simple dish, but the style at Oso is a little overworked on the presentation side I think. Having said that the food itself was nice, and accompaniments were also good. Moderately expensive wine list.So overall well worth a visit
5
Brilliant Italian food and wine, served elegantly in a classy, relaxed atmosphere. The veal shanks were perfectly tasty and tender; my wife raved about the sea bream; and the ravioli with mushrooms was as good as it gets. The portions were ample, and no one had room for dessert. The wine selection will definitely make you happy, and the service was flawless. An ideal place for a quiet, classy and scrumptious dinner
5
This place is not to be missed! Everything is perfect; the staff, the food, the wines and the atmosphere. We shared a really nice plate of cold cuts for a starter and then went for talgiatelle with lobster - it was perfect! My friends ahd ossu bucco whÃ­ch they both loved. We shared cheese for dessert and a nice bottle of wine. Very reasonable price, and the staff is extrenmely accomodating and friendly. A real pleasure to dine here
5
Fantastic, especially the humidity controlled room for storing cold cuts - must order the antipasto plate - all the meats melt in your mouth. Boyfriend and I had risotto and sea bream baked in rock salt. Excellent, also nice to hang in the patio after dinner for cigar and limoncello and enjoying the ambiance of the neighborhoo
4
Very happy with our dinner at Oso. The waiters were very well versed with the menu and we went with their recommendations which were spot on:Starters: Burrata and Spinach SaladMains: Sea Bass with Mushrooms and the Vegetarian PenneDessert: Black Pepper Caramel Panna Cotta Will come back
3
The food is good but not worth the price, service is snobbish to the point of being absurd, but if you really like captains and waiters to pretend they speak bad english with and italian accent to feel your getting your moneys worth, this is the place
5
Let me start out by saying I'm not a fan of Italian food. I think it's overpriced bread and noodles. But this restaurant has the best bread and noodles I've ever tasted. The staff was warm and friendly and gave excellent recommendations. I had squid ink risotto- the only dish I believe requires skills to create. And we had 2 pastas and a veal Milanese to share. Everything was excellent. Well cooked, seasoned and balanced dishes. Perhaps the ravioli looked a little too much like wontons for my liking. Desert was good too. Warm chocolate cake. The risotto was definitely the winner and standout of this restaurant. I'll be back many times(
5
Wie have Diner at OSO Severus Times over the past years, The experience was great on any of these occasions. Last night we had a dinner to celebrate wedding anniversary and again, what a pleasure. Starting with drinks at bar area the evening will be a memorable one. Starters, including parma ham, burrato, mixed salad with Parmesan, mains with ravioli on measurement cam and osobucco, everything fresh, prepared to perfection and served with what I could easily call the highest level of service in Singapore. Looking forward to our next dinner at OSO
5
Great team of Chef Diego Chiarini and Manager who ensure a perfect feeling of being "guests". Will recommend to anyone ( have done many times already) and will visit over and over again.
4
The downstairs bar was deceptively quiet but the restaurant was packed and we ate on the veranda.mgood food, not spectacular, and slightly pricy. Recommended though.
5
Friends invited us to restaurant Oso in Singapore, and that was a great choice.All dishes we had were very, very good. Outstanding were the homemade ravioli with veal in mixed cheese fondue, the spider crab "granchio" meat and the ossobuco (!)Service was great. We were quite slow in ordering and then just ordered a couple of dishes each time to share. Waiters were always friendly and patient, and gave great advice on wine.We had a table outside on the balcony, which was quite cozy. However if the hustle and bustle of Singapore bothers you, make sure to book a table inside.Definitely a restaurant we will go back to, if only to sample the rest of the quite extensive menu

My wife and i celebrated our 12 year anniversary at OSO Ristorante. Previously, we went to the same restaurant a year ago, so we thought we know about the services, food portion and price. We were placed behind a big table near the wall, so we were next to someone's back side within 1 feet. My wife ordered a Seafood Spaghetti and I had a Fettuccine. When the dishes arrived, we thought they were wrong, we were shocked about the portion, it seemed very small, we can't find any seafood except one shrimp as I recalled, and they charged $24 for the seafood spaghetti and they charged $34 for the Fettuccine, I called the waiter and to ensure we had a right orders and he confirmed it. With two glasses of wine (@$28), the total bill was $175.35 including 10% tip. We left the restaurant hungry

We have been fans of Oso since it's inception as a tiny, cramped restaurant in Tanjong Pagar. The enlarged restaurant is now housed in a heritage shophouse right on the corner of Bukit Pasoh Road, with atmosphere wrap-around open balcony where you can also request a table.Foremost, the cuisine, menu selection and wine list is superb. I adore their foie gras and their antipasto platter is to die for as an appetiser (They have a walk in antipasto and cheese room where you can make your own selections.) Usually I am torn between their aromatic black truffle and cheese risotto and the braised veal cheek, although their pan fried seabass last visit was great too.So what makes this one of my favourite restaurants over and above the cuisine?a) Ambience - Arrive at the red and white conservation house, leave your car with the valet and enter the downstairs bar. There's usually a live band and a fabulous cigar lounge. The Italian restaurant itself is upstairs. My husband loves that he can start his cigar over a scotch in the bar and pop out to the balcony in between courses.b) What I like is that all the waiters are old hands and well versed in their impressive wine list. Sure there are multiple figure, grand wines, but even excellent, affordable wines by the half bottle. They organise not just by the traditional red/ white and regions, but helpfully list by points from respected wine awards at the back. I've discovered excellent new wines from their recommendations, not all at in the higher price bracket.c) Service level - One of owners Stephane always seems to be there ensuring discreet yet attentive service. Our last visit for an anniversary celebration unexpectedly saw us having to bring our 10 year old son at the last minute. They treated him with the utmost courtesy and made a point of addressing questions to him, not us. OK, this is not usually a restaurant for families but I was pleased that he was made to feel welcome and grown up.d) The restaurant layout is not fantastic with limited privacy but I like the Wine room which can be reserved (well in advance!) as a private room for 4
4
I have been to Oso on numerable occasions over the past few years and each time I have had a great experience. I have been for romantic dinners with my husband, small groups of friends and then larger groups in one of the private rooms they have there. The food is consistently very good as is the service. If you like Italian food it is definitely worth a visit. Like all restaurants in Singapore it is not cheap but unlike most it is worth it. Apparently, you are able to take your own wine and pay corkage if you like. I have never done this as have always enjoyed the wines from the menu. Overall a great place in Singapore that I will continue to visit time and time again - love it
4
Food :Great Quality and Taste Had good vegetarian options Service :Very attentive and well trained staff Valet service available just outside the restaurant - much needed We sat on the upper level . For the price they charge a bit of privacy should be expected . The tables are packed in too close and the restaurant was just too loud
3
Love a nice meal every weekend, with the many fabulous restaurants around, OSO did not impress. +'veGood atmosphere (level 1)wonderful service staff-'veFeels rather 'Stuffy'Food is average, ingredients are not very special and cooking is passable. Nothing impressive.Been there 3x in 2011 as I used to frequent and love it when it was still tucked along Tanjong Pagar Road. Rather disappointing.
5
It's a bit dark on the first floor but that also creates a nice atmosphere; romantic - if it wouldn't have been with colleagues.Never thought I would go to SIN for venison, but it was excellent soft meat with tasty warm slides of apple. Doesn't sound Italian - nor Singaporean. Although the owners are proudly calling their restaurant an "culinary embassy of Italy", it felt to me very European in general. But don't get me wrong, the place offers excellent variaty of starters and main courses and an impressive wine list. And it's relatively affordable. After dinner we went -enjoying a good cigar from time to time- to the small but lovely terras / balcony and added a few brandys and coffees.All in a very relaxing athmosphere. One of the best places to go to in stead of staying every night in one of the dull and overcrowded restaurants of your hotel.Next time in SIN I'll go back to Oso - no doubt

This is a very good high quality Italian restaurant that needs to be booked. I have been here three times (for lunch and dinner) and have enjoyed myself every time. The atmosphere is busy and very Italian and if you can get a table on the balcony it makes for a great night. Service has always been very good as is the wine list. Food at times can be a little inconsistent but it is still of a high standard and thoroughly enjoyable. I will be back

Stephane and Diego run a well oiled machine. Cold cuts and cheeses are a must. Good value wine list.

Loved the cold cuts and cheeses. Great bottle of Valpolicella Allegrini wine warmed me up in the mean while we enjoyed capriolo meat and cinghiale straccetti...wow.
Thanks Daniele!

Have been there many times and have never been disappointed.

Not one bit of Asian influence on the taste, a real delight to find! Very authentic, with subtle tastes; rich but not heavy. We had the pork (to die for!), ravioli (almost to die for) and gnocchi (good but will try something else next time). The service is attentive and impeccable, full on, but with under statement and class. A bit pricy, but I find nearly all food pricy in Singapore away from the hawker stalls and fast food places. On our repeat list

Delicious Italian food with different menu that stands out from the competitors. However, the dining room ceiling height is pretty low; which made the chattering from every other tables can be heard. Which then made everyone of them to raise their voice volume, just to be able to talk within their table. If you are looking for a quiet dining place, this is not the place. And oh... endless phototaking with flash from every other table is quite annoying as well. Eventhough we love the food, the ambience will keep us from coming back

Two of my friends highly recommend me to this place and I decided to give a try for dinner. Like the warm service, ambience, menu and wine selection. Yes it is a must to start with the burrata and tomatoes. I suggest to share it follow by your main course and etc

OSO is one of the best Italian restaurants in Singapore. They spend the money for good quality ingredients and it shows in the taste of the food. Try the cold cuts and cheese.Their meats and wines are fantastic, pastas are a bit weak ... you will not be disappointed with this restaurant

Have to confess to being a regular diner at this restaurant - but the reason for that is that it never fails to deliver top notch food combined with good service in an enjoyable atmosphere.Went there again last Saturday with the wife and kids (7 and 5) for an early slot, 6.30. Already a few tables were occupied - Saturday night, fully booked. In fact, I think most nights this place gets fully booked. From the initial "buona sera" to my wee girls to the final getting a taxi for you, the service is there. The food? Excellent. Wide choice and it's the sort of place that encourages me - often fussy - to try different things. Took the stracci pasta as a starter option - fresh pasta with wild boar. Just makes you want to keep eating it - delicious, and the kids were fans also. Main course I went for pork belly with portobello mushrooms. I'm not sure I'd order that dish anywhere else - but I did here and it was a melt-in-the-mouth treat. Beautiful. Other dishes that went around the table were venison and deboned goose. I could have easily eaten any of them. All of them. But then the family would have complained ;-)Desserts also something to look forward to - the pannacotta is the best I've ever tasted, in a caramel and black pepper sauce. Kids shared one of those. I went for baked apples, the mrs for a gorgonzola and pear compote terrine - unusual and delicious.Wine list is extensive and the sommellier is a good back up - they don't automatically head for the expensive options.Favourite restaurant in Singapore. Although they have just opened a sister resto in the Goodwood Park Hotel - Gaya. That may give them a run for their money :-)They have a separate bar where nibbles can be ordered (full meals as well) and outside seating on their balcony. Also several private rooms of various sizes. Can also eat in the wine cellar - takes about 8 people

Since we are in Singapore we have been there at least 5 times within a month!! The Food is excellent, the fresh traditional Burrata and cherry tomatoes is a must, the daily specials are always a delight and the service makes you feel right at home.I would recommend this place 100

The place is really nice and the food is good. They offer a very nice variety of italien dishes. The presentation of food is lovely too. The prices are accordingly high. So you get what you pay for. They also offer set lunches which are very reasonably priced. The service is fantastic. Staff is very attentive and friendly. All in all, I would recommend the place for a special occasion. It is quiet too, so you can have a peaceful lunch

excellent service and food, value for money set lunch. loved the stuffed porcini mushroom.
3
Tried the set lunch. Chicken liver pate is good, but the mascarpone mousse is heavenly. The fish platter is ho-hum. Fish was dry. Will still go back to try their other dishes.
4
great italian!!
rabbit is recommended!!

Wonderful food and excellent service. Aircon is private rooms needs care not to freeze out your guests and music level can be a tad invasive

Best italian in town!

Terrible food (meats/fish/pasta) and service leaves a lot to be desired
5
Truly a gem! great food, great service, great chef, great cheese locker! although the bar tender could be a bit grumpy sometimes but can be easily forgiven. Just hoping that they won't raise the price.

Heard a lot in press about OSO and had to try it. Housed in an old colonial shophouse near Chinatown, the dining hall is on the 2nd floor. The design was good, but you'll feel a little cramped in the small size, especially when the place fills up later in the evening. The starter mushroom soup was thick and very good with chunks of porcini. The mains of beef and lamb were very good. Being an italian restuarant we tried the tiramisu and wasn't disappointed. We also had a bottle of the german Dr Loosen Reisling and it was satisfying. For group dinners you can also book the private room and wine cellers. Pretty cool. A couple of weeks later, we tried their sister french restaurant Absinthe next door and it was very good too

We celebrated my husbands birthday at Oso and where so thrilled by the personal attention, the very modern decor, amazing wine list and the most authetic modern italian food. It was a real find. Very much an expat haunt but in a really interesting little part of Singapore. The Truffle rissotto was fabulous and make sure teh chef choses your cheese board from teh glass cheese room
4
Oso is just great.. good food.. fine Italian, the real thing. Oso is one of my favorite... if not "the" favorite in Singapore. I moved from Tokyo and then before that NYC so I appreciate what Oso has to offer...They have a classic cheese room which makes it real.. it can get pricy but worth it..I wanted to make my rating maybe 5 stars but I am still exploring the city since since I've lived here for @ 1 yea

Great lamb rack & cheese. definitely a place to go back to.

Good food and service. Set lunches are very good

Excellent neighbour! Really good service and small in-between-dishes

Good service. Nice ambience. I had a Chicken Thigh Penne and shared this rather unusual appetiser with a sunny side up and truffle and cheese. Nice.
4
It's very rich, but consistently tasty. Bring the corporate card and some clients.
5
try the lamb and the truffles risotto. choco tart is so sinfully gorgeous.

Food was mediocre for those prices. Waiters are presumptious!!

One of the best Italian restaurants in Singapore with extensive/excellent winelist. Good ambience and great food

Go for the beautiful home made pasta or intimate dining room with outstanding personalized service.I visited on a Friday night sans partner since I've just moved here. I was seated at a table where I could relax and not feel out of place since I was by myself.The menu is exciting to read for the unusual flavours and shows a deeper dive into Italian regional fare. Try the wild boar ragout with homemade wholemeal pasta. The cheese room looks outstanding and the resulting plate that arrives at your table will not disappoint.Complementary chicken pate taster and bread plate arrived once I was seated.The wine list is extensive. Great that the by-the-glass options are not your run of the mill selections. I dearly wanted to see what a SG$585 bottle of red would taste like though! Love that the chef who is also part owner, stops by to chat. Since I was eating alone I was placed at a table that would make me feel comfortable. Try a limoncello or grappa if you are too full for one of the gorgeous desserts. The crowd was a combination of western and singaporean; small work dinner groups , older couples, and dating couples. I would absolutely love to come back for dinner with work or on a date.Call ahead and you need to book ahead (up to 2 weeks is what I've heard) or opt for a late dinner to get in sooner

Above average Italian dishes. They have a nice variety of Italian cheeses. Waitstaff is very attentive and nice. Place is warm and cozy. Will definitely go back.

Great food, and fab setting;

Reservations are usually needed, esp for weekends. Stephen and Diego are delightful to their guests and the staff who have been with them for years are utterly charming. Pricey but worth the food and ambiance.

crappy service

Food was decent, but overshadowed by terrible service. Won't go back.

Fantastic place for innovative Italian food and vino! Intimate, cozy atmosphere slightly on the formal side but not stuffy. Nice small bar area in front to have a few cocktails before dinner. Great place to take a date or a boss you want to impress. Also have a dedicated cheese room with cheeses fr Italy you can't source elsewhere in Sinagapore
