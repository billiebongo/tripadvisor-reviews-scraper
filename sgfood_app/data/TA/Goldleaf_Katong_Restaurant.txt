Came here for lunch today and chose some fish, pork and vegetables with porridge. The meal took a long time to arrive and wasn't really anything special once it came. A little expensive for what you get. Won't be back.

Reserved a table for 12 pax for lunch. But the kitchen was understaffed. Waited very long. The portion is small for the price. Acceptable quality, but can't say delicious. Clean environment.

Went there for dinner with a few friends. Friendly service with memorable food. Will bring my grandparents back!

The amount of each dish was very small so they were expensive! At the end the money could be spent elsewhere for better value of money.

My family of 8 had a birthday celebration dinner at this restaurant. There were about 3-4 other tables which were occupied. The serving staff was attentive to our needs. Gave us free Chinese tea to go with the birthday cake and desserts. The dishes were delicious and we love the sweet potato porridge! Highly recommended

The restaurant was not full, but still there were plenty of happy groups in there, some families, some just groups of mates. The atmosphere was clean and efficient and smiley.There is a good choice in the menu. Not overly expensive for Singapore.I will recommend it to friend

Great Taiwanese food at this restaurant tucked away in the quiet Amoy Street of Singapore. Head waitress simply suggested various dishes like fragrant chicken, salted fish fried rice, prawn dip, tofu and kai lan stir fried vegetables and a simply mysterious seaweed dish with vegetables. Enjoyed the evening. The staff are very friendly and professional. Worth several more visits.

We went there for a birthday dinner on a Friday evening and surprisingly, there was no crowd in this restaurant compared to the others nearby. We have 5 adults with 2 young children. Some dishes were a little salty and it's advisable to order porridge to eat with it. The minced meat was nice. Mee Sua was not as good as those I tried in Taiwan. Other than that, food was average. Total bill costs about S$110 which we thought can get tastier food elsewhere

Rediscovered GoldLeaf Taiwan Porridge Restaurent in Amoy Street after many years. Used to go there quite often in the 70s when they were in Orchard Road.One of the all-time favorites was Fresh Cockles in special sauce. Glad to see it is back, although was told it is not available everyday if they are not fresh. So you can be sure they are fresh if they have it on the menu when you are there.The Signature Cod fish with speciality sauce was done with perfection - crispy skin and perfectly cooked flesh.The hay choh was tasteful with larger chunks of meat inside.The Brinjal with minced meat and shrimps was done just right with the brinjal not too mushy. However, could do with a bit more meat and shrimps.The Braised Pork with preserved vegetables was excellent with not too much fat and not too salty vegetables.The porridge could be served a little bit hotter.The orh nee paste was too fine (bordering on KFC smashed potato). It was not too sweet or cloying though.All-in-all, food was fine with delicate balance of tastes
