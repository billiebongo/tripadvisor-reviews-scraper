Best prawn noodles I've had in a looooong time! Braised pork added in the shrimpy broth for that extra oomph. Sat there and marinated in its yummy goodness.

In Sg you can find all kinds of food. You want to treat your stomach better, please try this white noodle soup which is also the signature dish this Old House recommend. I am not a fan of soup base noodle..I chance upon this place recommended by my bestie. The noodle is really really delicous and is the heng hua style of cooking. We ordered the other signature dish the Big dinasour prawn noodle is equally delicous. Yummy yummy. After my 1st visit I went back almost every week. MUST TR

Just had an excellent dinner in this seafood and meat eating house.A third generation Hokkien establishment, and you can tell that the present cooks have learnt their trade from their elders/grandparents. The salt&pepper pork-neck (with no bones) was astounding and the beef plate ran a close second. Some of the meals are super spicy & very hot, but our server guided us through the menu and helped us with any queries we had. The marinated mussels were in a rich tomato and pimento sauce with what looked like cheese thru' the sauce. It looked rather italian, but I was assured it was Hokkien. The steamed cockles were of the oriental type, and not for my european taste or delicate like the european variety of cockle, they were very strong, rather briney and a bit bloody. The failing was of our palette being not accustom to the flavour, and by no means any failing of the restaurant. We had one of the best meals, very flavoursome, and would recommend this place to anybody, just watch out for the cockles, if you're anyway delicate - but definitely give it a go
