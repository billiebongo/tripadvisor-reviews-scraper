Stopped in here for lunch and it was busy with locals. I had the chapati and a vegetable curry and both were great and so inexpensive.

As local and authentic as you can get in Little India...join all the uncles for breakfast at Amri and enjoy prata and masala with your hands. The open air seating adds to the ambience.

Would not be a much fan of this place .. The taste was not of my liking ... though many people liked it ..

Went on a recommendation from the Lonely Planet which was fully justified; food was outstanding and extremely cheap (S$12 for 3 curries and 4 chapattis). Particularly recommend the Chicken Curry (Special) and the Potato and Spinach, and ordering more chapattis than you think you‚Äôll need.

cheap, but fresh and good portion food. had mutton kima curry and beans soup with chapati, prob one of the cheapest place to eat and teh tarik is 0.75 cent was made my day. You will see many local having meal during breakfast time.

Traditional Indian food. In Little India. Ran into it after getting of the tourist hop on/ off bus at the northern end. Nothing fancy but very cheap and tasty. Great for a quick bite and rest whilst exploring Singapore. Most dishes between 3-6 sgd.

The place don't look nice. But MUST eat there. Fresh and super tasty, perfect food. Chapatis and food is to die for. Huge portions of food. Super cheap. Lamb dish was one of the best lamb curries i have eaten. Meat melted in our mouths. Awesome taste

Order the lamb with chapati. Food was served in styrofoam which make the entire experience a downer. Somehow, in a traditional coffeeshop in Little India serving authentic food, you would expect a fork and spoon at least. Chapati was nice and warm but the lamb portion was miserable for the price. Flavour was ok at best. Did not finish the 2 chapatis as there was insufficient curry and lamb. What a pity

I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m so glad we found this place. We were actually on our way to a TA-recommended Indian spot for lunch but we liked the scene as we walked by Asmi Chapati: The place was no-frills with only fans to keep you from sweating in the hot weather, limited menu was on the wall, and drinks were ordered at a different counter. But chapati was cooked to order on one side and we could clearly see that regulars (mostly older men eating alone at that time) were enjoying their chapati with various dishes of chicken, mutton, goat, vegetables, etc.Service was brisk but courteous, and our food came out quickly. Our chicken masala, biryani, and saag aloo were delicious! It turned out that our original lunch destination was right across the street, but we were completely satisfied with our lunch at Azmi

Whether you sit at tables inside or out on the footpath you are with the locals in their environment. While it may not look overly inviting, Azmi is a good place for a basic snack or meal. The menu is on a sign near the door and you order and pay inside at the window. Meal prices vary from about $1.60 (Channar Masala) to $3.40 (tasty Mutton Keema) per plate with the fresh, tasty Chapatti at two for 90c. High alcohol Indian beers (about $6) are available from the counter at the rear of the store. Try the lovely sweet Appam for dessert

Decent chappati overpriced curry. While the chappati prepared exotically, the venue is just too dirty. Location is good. The coffee shop really needs cleaning up. Quite unhygienic to a certain extent.
5
Can't convince my family to eat this with me. You see here mostly man. Don't know why. Chapati can't get any fresher. The popular combination is Chapati with Keema, minced mutton. Many vegetarian option too. Come for a hearty meal.

the worst meal at a worst place in my life some more in singapore -- a country with high claims ........

cheap and ok food. the chapatis are made on grill heated by oven and sometimes are thick (thicker than usual). due to this they become chewy if they are cold. Dishes are very cheap and have few varieties.
5
The chapatis are amazing!
Soft, chewy and so fresh!
The place is rustic though, don't expect fine china, silverware or napkins.
The three of ate plenty of chapati with three veggie curries for $9.80!
Definitely worth a try...

Quick late morning snack. Earlier than noon, so no line and available tables. 2 chapatis and we shared a chicken curry. Plus a plate of cucumbers with lime halves. Around or less than S$6. Near the Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple so we made both stops on the same outing. It is a basic food place, so have realistic expectations. We liked it

I tried 2 chapattis (which were nice and hot) with chicken curry. It was a drumstick and a thigh but i think the chicken was anorexic. Hardly any meat and it was alittle tough so not sure sure it was fresh. The curry was OK. Service is rapid. Seating is OK....what can you expect in Little India!! The cost for meal was SGD$5.80. Not bad. Though the chicken was not good. Don't try that....i would go for the vegetarian option or eat elsewhere
4
We searched this place out as it had been recommended as the best place for chapattis in Singapore. we weren't disappointed. We simply ate freshly made chapattis with a simple curry and some dahl to share. The restaurant is extremely basic, but that is the beauty of it. There was an old man going round clearing and cleaning the tables. The food was extremely cheap. Would happily go there again
2
The Chapati was good but the curry was quite ordinary. Had 4 chapatis and a mutton curry for S$7.50. Most of all, the atmosphere or the vibe of the place was not to my liking. Have a look at the place beforehand if you plan to take your family for an eat out as it could be very congested. In my few days in Singapore, I found better places in Little India to have good Indian food

Been to this roadside eatery, in case u r staying for more than 2-3 days and u want to have chapati with simple veg / non-veg then this is the place. rest of the places serve maida made Nan / parotha, which is not good for stomach. Average food may by less than 10 SD, restaurant itself is on main road, so u may not have to search for it. usually u will find many families having food here, seems popular amongst locals. Closes by 10:30 pm, so although i had short-listed, by the time i returned from Mustafa, it was closed

We tried the capati and thosei here. Its dirt cheap as compared to other restaurants and food is yummy! Two thumbs up!üëçüëç

Hi ,we are six member of famaly 8 days visit to singapore and malasiya,3days in singapore and 5 days in malasiya.arrived 24th june.

No nonsense, simple, no chills, no thrills, very basic service and good Indian Chapathi and food can be had here. Did I forgot to mention that too in best of economical budget. As one can say very elementary place with few basic varieties of veg and non veg(non veg is more famous) to be eaten with Chapathi. It reminded me of my college days. Must visit at least once and you can skip your family simply because they may not like this elementary food and service. Loved it and would come back for sure

I have been to Singapore during Sep-2008 to Dec-2008 and was staying quite a far as i remember to come to Little India just for this.I think it was first time when I visited to Little India and was desperately searching for simple food in Singapore as most the food that I tried in the open eateries was rice with some curries.As I entered and check the menu with the price(my personal thinking if it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s reasonable it is tasty and 99% time it worked in my case who cares ambience if you really hungry) I said let me try it.When the food came from the smell and the color I was amazed and you will not believe that day and days I stayed in S'pore mostly every weekend or that Friday evening I would be found there. I think the owner or the worker is from Azamgarh(Place in UP, India) I remember asking to one of the staff over there...I would strongly recommend to try this place at least once for people who likes Roti/Fulka with some delicious NON Veg/Curries...

Im a big chapati fan and whenever I am in singapore i always want indian food. When taking a taxi into the city from the airport, the taxi driver and I started talking about food. He was part indian and said that the best and most well known chapati place is Azmi in little india. After googling it and knowing where it was, i started my journey to find this place.After taking a few of the MRT's and walking a long distance i finally found myself at Azmi. I decided on a stack of chapatis with chickpeas and daal on the side. It was very affordable, and it wasn't bad, but it definitely wasn't the best chapati that Ive ever had. Just different than what I like. I like my chapati thinner and chewy like a tortilla. This chapati had the consistency of a thinner pita bread. They are very popular and got packed extremely quick. I would suggest to give it a try, you might love it

After taking south indian, chinese and bangladeshi meals in Singapore, we were craving for north indian dishes and decided to give Azmi a try This is a nondescript very ordinary looking small restaurant without any frill. Inside this small restaurant,there are two more small outlets-one south indian and the other chinese serving idli,dosa vada etc and tea/coffee and soft drinks respectively Azmi is reputed for its roti which are very soft and thick but not underdone Though they are known to serve delicious keema curry, we went for veg dishes We took one roti,a bowl of rice one plate of alu gobi and one plate of chana masala which were sufficient for two of us for lunch! This lunch costed us as low as S$4 60 cents in a pricey city like Singapore and it was very satisfying Though the restaurant was not very neat and clean, all the dishes were served in disposable thermocole dishes and plate

This place does chapattis and keema. If you visit, all you will see anyone eating is this, so that is what you should choose. The chapattis are really good - hardy enough to pick up the mince without falling apart, yet soft to the touch and bite. The keema is actually a keema matar, as the mince has peas in it. A great, cheap option for delicious fast food
5
Stopped by for breakfast on the recommendation by a local friend. I didn't know the greatness of chapatis, okra (lady fingers) and fried eggs while dining alfresco until now. The chapati was so fresh off the griddle that it was a bit hot to handle, but I soldiered on and ate through it
5
"Secret of good mood, taste of Azmi's food" This Mantra, written above the service counter rings true. We love this little restaurant, it is no fuss authentic Indian food. The staff are helpful and approachable, and very welcoming. 2 people can eat well, with drinks, for little more than $5. Even if we have a short stop over in Singapore between flights we jump straight onto a train and head to Azmi's for Chapati and curry! You can't beat it! Don't hesitate or walk backwards and forwards past the shop trying to make a decision.... just go here and have a great meal

The food was fantastic and super cheap, we went there for breakfast but don't expect a western food style breakfast, we enjoyed the paper pancakes aka dosa with chilli, love love loved it. Because we had such yummy food we went back for lunch, the chicken masala and chapati with a couple of tiger beers. Looking forward to go back agai
