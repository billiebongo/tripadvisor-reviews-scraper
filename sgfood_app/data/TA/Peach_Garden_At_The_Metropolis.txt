Reliable chain for cantonese dim sum. Had the usual XO carrot cake, custard bun, fried mee sua, chicken feet, century egg porridge. All good. They don't have pork pastry and the mango rolls were blah
4
Had pork in goose liver sauce, kai lan, and chicken salted fish rice. All tasty and fresh. Staff pleasant and attentive. Restaurant was spacious and quiet during my visit.

Food is good.. mostly Chinese.. service is also ok... Duck meat is good..... Ambience is also ok... It's more of an official business lunch or dinner kind of place .. but occasional leisure visit is also ok

Food was ok, more of a Singaporean Chinese variety. Service was quick and everyone was very attentive through out the service. Prices were reasonable. I will likely return

Went today for Chinese New Year lunch. Food was average and so was service. Jasmine tea served was cold, I asked for a hot pot and they served like warm tea.. lol.
Food was Okish, average taste. Waiters although polite looked Overworked and stressed.

Peach Garden is really well known and this area of town desperately needed a nice Chinese restaurant. Peach Garden would be perfect and the prices of this restaurant are very reasonable. Unfortunately the restaurant is very small and it doesn't "feel nice". Work customers etc are just a little packed too close together, waiters under-staff during lunch time and not as nice as downtown

Went there for dinner as there was a promotion at Peach Garden for the Peking duck and Suckling Pig. Both were well done and satisfying. However, it was a pity that the cabbage it provided for the fried duck meat was sub-standard relative to other fine Chinese dining restaurants. Some of the dishes could have been cooked and presented better as well

A Cantonese style Chinese Restaurant located in office tower right next to Buona Vista MRT station. This restaurant is usually packed during lunch hours, so reservation is strongly recommended. It offers dim sums, ala-carte dishes and sets selection. There are some vegetarian dishes, vegetarian set menu and halal set menu.The food here is consistent with other Peach Garden restaurants. However, the services was quite disappointed. Waiting time is quite long. In my recent visit last week during lunch time, the noodles we ordered took 40 minutes to be served, despite checking with the waitress 3 times. It was also difficult to get their attentions as they seems to be very busy. You need to set aside at least 1.5 hours to have meal here. The prices are also quite expensive. If you are around these areas, Canto Paradise at Star Vista basement is a much better alternative, food are better and cheaper. I only come here for business meals, wouldn't pay high prices to come here

I brought a visitor from out-of-town and unfamiliar with Asian food for lunch here. Service was impeccable -- they offered him spoon and fork, and didn't blink when we asked for water instead of tea. He asked for Siracha sauce (?!), and they provided hot chili sauce. They noticed what he didn't /couldn't consume, and quickly cleared away his uneaten bowl without any fuss. Very sensitive to out-of-town guests, which I appreciate.The steamed fish with soy sauce was nice, the XO fish not so much. Food was good, not amazing. It was not cheap, it was 'rreasonable' (lunch was covered by the company). If it was my own dime, I'd go someplace else where I could get better food for less (I don't need the attentive service.

Went for their 4 tier steamboat last night. Food was decent though nothing to shout about. They plastered signs advertising their 4 people dine for the price of 3 everywhere in the vicinity. We were a party of 3 adults and one 10 year boy. They insisted on charging for the boy citing "policy" that the promotion only applied to 4 adults. So the restaurant charges you LESS if 4 adults eat than if 3 adults and an almost-adult eat. Go figure! Small amount of money but irritatingly un-customer friendly.

Very good quality, great service and a nice terrace if the temperature allows it.
I went here for lunch and it was just perfect.

Loved this place! Every dish was well prepared and you could tell the Chef was a talented one. From the salted egg prawns to the good old favourite sweet and sour pork, perfect flavour and bite. A little out of the way but worth a trip. They also have what looks like a great steamboat that every other table was having which we will try next time!

This was the second trip here for Tim Sum lunch.Crowd was ok. Service was prompt BUT not good enough, the waitresses could not pour tea properly. The table was wet each time they serve more tea into my cup! The food is good enough though

Had Set Lunch today and was delighted. Food is tasty, fresh and service prompt.Set menu consists of Dim Sum set, chicken soup, their signature fish paste noodles and jelly dessert. Fresh and delicious. Noodles were just too good.Prices are on higher side but its a fine dining restaurant (atleast they position themselves as)

We booked the restaurant for our wedding reception. We were in touch with Jasline Lin, Senior event sales manager, through out the whole process of planning and preparation. She was very helpful and efficient. On the big day, we had the whole restaurant, including the alfresco area, to ourselves. We used the outdoor area for our cocktail reception and the indoors for dining. Everyone loved the food. Service for dinner was good.The only hiccup was with the wine. No wine was included in the package because my husband and I agreed that free-flow beer was good enough for a Chinese cuisine dinner. However, wine was offered to guests and the staff did not take it easy on opening up new bottles. We would love to have been informed of this right away. In the end, we paid for it thinking the guests all enjoyed the dinner and had a good time celebrating our marriage. I hope the managers will take note of this to improve your services.I give good rating this time mainly for the food. Will come back to try other dishes

This is a popular restaurant for Chinese dining in Biopolis. The restaurant can get crowded quickly and noisy so have business discussion can be difficult. There are both set and ala carte menu, and the selections of dim sum is average. For dinner there is a steamboat menu which can be pricy. Service can be slow at times but with the limited options available for Chinese dining in the area, you get used to it.

Located in Metropolis Tower. Been there with a group of seven for business dinner. Service was average, neither truly friendly nor unfriendly: more un-interested. Food was quite OK, fish served with wrong timing. Vegetable overcooked and dead in taste. Atmosphere (in a small private dining room) was un-inspiring, no music, no view. Prices quite high because used by business guests only

This was a good name and i was expecting a somewhat pricey but good dinner. It was half fulfilled and no prizes for guessing which half. The steamed chicken in brands essence of chicken looked and tasted like frozen chicken. When I pointed I out to the waitress, the response I got was FIFO.The seaperch with snow fungus was just that: white and black with a green sprig as decoration. Chinese fine food must not only taste right but look right.I also ordered a tofu dish and a sweet and sour pork. The last dish was all right.The rice itself was the best done.Service was barely competent. The waitress had to check what the soup of the day was.The bill for the three of us came to $105, without dessert. We drove across the road for dessert

Been here several times since my office shares the same building. Their dim sum is usually reliable and i order the favorites - chicken feet, roasted pork belly, roasted pork puffs etc. For the carrot cake, i skip the dim sum version and go for the XO version in the a la carte menuService is usually slack and not great here, so we just try to get used to i

Upscale restaurant with dim sum for lunch. I went with three locals who did the a la carte ordering, so I donâ€™t know the names of the dishes. But it included several dumpling (with either rice or wheat noodles) and a selection that came in black, green or white wraps. Everything was good but the fish selections were the best. We also had small triangular red bean paste desserts. My colleagues were less impressed than I was. But I thought it was quite pricey unless for special occasions (223 SGD for 4 people for lunch)
