Cupcakes are heavenly. Very nice ambience simple and cute. Parking would be a really challenge but once you get your hands on the cupcakes it will be all worth it.

Everyone heading here should definitely try the Red Velvet Nutella Cupcakes as it is very delicious for a sweet tooth like me

They offered light and fluffy frosting on your cupcake, adequate selection of sweet treats that you would have to take time to decide which one you wanna go with. Friendly staff with a home-style ambiance.

Had the tea cupcake. Was scrumptious! Little hidden jem. The filling and crisp caramel thing on top was delish. Would def recommend. Girls working there were also sweet x

Expensive but taste good. The texture of the cupcakes really superb. I bought a few flavor and absolutely will be looking forward for their new flavor.

I ordered the ferrero cake online and had it delivered to a friend. The deliveryman sent prompt updates and was very easy to coordinate with despite the fact that there were minor adjustments to the delivery location. More importantly, my friend raved about the cake itself! Will definitely order again

Located in an unassuming location( somewhere near Kampung Glam & Arab Street), this bakery serves sinfully delicious and well... fattening cupcakes. It’s definitely worth the hefty taxi fares from downtown Singapore to come all the way here. What’s special about their cakes is how they core the cakes to add in the fillings so that the toppings go beyond the surface as in literally speaking

Bought some Fluff-y goodies for the first time today for a family birthday celebration. Reached the store abt 5mins before the opening time & there was already a queue formed outside! Luckily, the staff are very efficient so the line moved quickly. Got an assortment of cakes (Ondeh-Ondeh, Bandung, Ferraro Roche) and cupcakes (Red Velvet, Salted Caramel, Horlicks, Thai Milk Tea, Lemon Merengue & Chocolate Cookie Dough). They were all delicious but my fav has to be the Bandung cake & Lemon Merengue cupcake!! The family enjoyed it so much too that they want to make this a birthday tradition! Look forward to trying other flavours next time

Don't normally fancy cupcakes but loveee fluff. I'm from KL but have gone to Singapore a couple of times, just for fluff. The cupcakes are good, what I like about them is the frosting is always so smooth, unlike some cupcakes. The desserts are also so good. Love the durian panna cotta and tiramisu shots (it 's so hard to find good non-alcoholic tiramisu). My siblings love fluff too (they're kids, so very fussy eaters)! So happy they're opening up shop in KL (my bank acc isn't as happy tho

Variety to choose from..we can't decide so we chose one each; horlicks, red velvet, salted caramel, ferrero rocher, a slice of strawberry shortcake and dark choc cheese (this is superb!). We love them all..not too sweet, reasonable price. Will definitely try the rest on our next trip to Singapor

I'm not into sweets or deserts but these cupcakes are a thing to savor! The dulce de leche and the salted caramel were out of this world! The line is big so be patient, it will pay off ;)
5
The cakes and pastries here are amazing, the cup cakes less so. Loved the dulce de leche. Better to go on weekdays as weekends has queues. Also, earlier the better because things tend to sell out fast.

My go-to bakery for cakes and cupcakes. The consistent taste and quality is what makes one return again and again.
Great flavour combinations, good service and as an added bonus you don't really need to queue nowadays.

Flavours available are interesting. They change flavours weekly except for the regular red velvet and salted caramel.
5
Cupcakes galore. Lots of variety. Pretty shop. No room for a sit down tete-a-tete. Flavours change weekly. Fresh tasting always.
5
I tasted one of these when a colleague brought them into the office - I was an instant convert! Now I'm back every week to get my fix :) The best ones are the salted caramel, the red velvet, and the chocolate. Mmmmm

The flavour are out-of-this-world. Moist cake with generous amount of fillings and toppings. Even the cake slices are to die for. So much variety, so little time. Highly recommended for those sweet-tooth explorer out there. The staff is ever-so-friendly. Having said there, you gotta grab yours fast... First come first serve. They can run out pretty quick if the flavour for that day is amazing.Will leave you coming back for more

It was a random day where me and my partner out of curiosity went in to the shop. Were both in awe with the range of the flavors of cupcake, cakes and range of delicacies they have.And so we purchase a box of 6. We brought it home and reserve it for our Game of Thrones night with our favorite cup of Tea. It was a moment of silence on our fist bite. Bite after bite little did we know the box is empty. Its was the best cupcake. The texture, consistency, proportion and creativity. I felt valued as a client that the price of the cupcake is worth paying for.Im looking forward for more flavors tocome. Kudos to all the people behind this wonderful shop!Zeus

Seems this is the worst kept secret among the halal food brigade, given there are two different halal groups giving this place 5/5 stars it has to be good, and it was. Lots of great cup cakes and other cakes and pastries. Very popular with locals and tourists, They were doing a very brisk trade at 4pm when we hit there and left with big bags of cakes to take home! This is a must see place, if you cna find it...google maps will get you ther

I like the cake, it has soft sponge and various topping and filing. Since i really really like dark chocolate, i took that and i like it.
5

the cupcakes is da bomb! my favorite will be the salted caramel, its has the moist cake, oozing filling and not so sweet frosting.
they sold out fast, you'd better come here early or you will back empty handed. its also Halal!

I've had several ondeh-ondeh cupcakes but this one from fluff was rather a disappointing one. However, their teh tarik is really delicious. Other cupcake flavors which are a must try would be the red velvet nutella, ispahan and nutella cheesecake pretzel crumbs. You can give a miss to the salted caramel and chocolate banana toffee. I'm a big fan of tarts and their Dulcey chocolate is THE most amazing one I've tried so far. That you have to give a try as well as their sea salt chewy chocolate chip cookie

Fluff bakery is an utter utter delight. They create such new and exciting flavours of cupcakes, tarts and panna cotta, eg. Red velvet Nutella, which never fails to delight. They also change the flavours every week, so it's always worth a revisit. Plus the sales team is a friendly and lovely bunch, and never fails to welcome me when I revisit them

The halal bakery is located at Jalan Pisang which is a walkable distance from Bugis MRT and there's also a bus stop which is located less than 5 minutes walk. The bakery offers a weekly set of 6 different flavour of cupcakes - 2 staple (red velvet nutella and salted caramel) and 4 others that changes weekly. The flavours are often a mix of local delights and exotic flavours. Think: chocolate milkshake and fries cupcake..ondeh-ondeh cupcake.. and they have other bakes (changes weekly as well) with equally exotic flavours like Banana Maple Bacon Pannacotta Shots, Man cake etc. Most of the bakes are delicious, but the cupcakes are a little soft for my liking. Hence, it is best consumed within a day or two. Otherwise it will crumble fast before you can put it into your mouth. Their cakes are pretty delicious but some are hit & misses. However, the shots are worth a try

I normally don't like cup cakes, just never understood the fascination. Yesterday we were strolling through after a meal at Arab St and we came across Fluff Bakery. A few purchases were made and I chose a red velvet Nutella cup cake which was actually amazing. I normally find red velvet a little dry, but not this time. And it if was, then the gooey Nutella took care of that. Overall amazing experience and friendly staf

Have followed Fluff bakery on instagram so was eager to visit on our recent stay in Singapore. Easy to find, not far from Arab St and Sultan Mosque. When we arrived the queue was out the door so this place is very popular. Purchased a take home 6 pack, my favourite was the salted caramel with the gooey caramel in the middle. There was no Teh Tarik cupcakes that day which I had really wanted to try. Oh well, maybe next time
3
I tried the Red Velvet Nutella (or Nutella Red Velvet),it was okay. Nothing to write home about. Maybe because there are just so many Nutella or Red Velvet cupcakes where I come from. But the Teh Tarik ones were amazing!!! They tasted exactly like teh tarik! And they were not too sweet. A bit pricey though with SGD4 apiece, no matter how many you buy. Maybe that's just how it is in Singapore.
