Bought 3 pieces for $12.90 and shared with a friend. Amazing taste, cooked to perfection, obviously picked ones that had not long been cooked. temperature controlled.

Average in taste and price. Last tried the durian pizza, unique and quite tasty. Good for quick meals.

Try 1 slice pepperoni pizza , add parmesan cheese and i think its really yummy pizza, good to know its halal so for moslems can eat this without worry.
The price around 4.5 $/slices.

Pezzo is a halal certified, we order 3-sliced pepperoni pizza cost us 12.90 SGD. Each slice size a bit huge for us so that suit for our lunch. The taste is fine, the meat are all over the pizza.

I had the slice of the Hola Hawaiian and Pepperoni Party.
I was hungry enough and the taste was ok. The pepperoni was over-cooked and the rest was not so good, but still average tasting as far as pizza goes.

Great variety, good size slices and good value makes this a time saving snack whilst in the middle of Singapore. Grab a couple of slices and keep shopping.

So i've ordered or been at a friends house who has ordered from Pezzo on a few occasions. Overall the pizza is average to be honest. Some of the pizza's are nicer than others. The pizza's with the different flavoured sauce on them especially are not very nice, they drown out the the main event and they're just not very good. The pepperoni or margarita are nicer, but again just above average. In terms of positives, they deliver very quickly which is good. I find it quite pricey for the quality, i think if you pay $24SGD the pizza should be better

I chanced upon a Pezzo pizza stall in Serangoon Nex Mall and I liked my second Pezzo pizza experience in one weekend. Pezzo has got many flavors of pizza to choose from. Both meat lovers and veggie lovers will surely enjoy their wide variety of pizzas made with fresh ingredients. Lately, they have introduced salted egg flavor which is so popular that it is always out of stock when I see a stall.One whole pizza can be divided into 6 big slices, instead of the usual 8. Pezzo is the first chain I noticed which serves half a pizza in an easy-to-carry rectangular box. Truly convenient.Last night, I tried 3 different varieties - chicken delight, carbonara and supremo. Having been launched during Christmas season only, the carbonara stood out with its creamy sauce, roasted turkey and ham, and oregano chicken, mushroom and mozzarella with cranberries on top. Pezzo pizzas taste good even the day after. From the fridge, just pop it in the oven for a couple of minutes. Guaranteed to still have that crust crunch. I've tried a quick microwave in the past but nothing beats oven re-heating which guarantees even heating while not reducing the crunchiness.Biggest surprise was the price. If you order one slice, you pay S$4.90 but 3 slices cost you only S$12.90 (or at closing time, S$11 which is a 25% discount)

This is a pure Pizza joint and right in the middle of the busy Orchard Street near Paragon Mall. There are various kinds of vegetarian and non vegetarian pizza, saw mostly regular thick crust. The hot and spicy chicken pizza was delicious. One can warm it and eat it there or use the take away services

If you're hungry whilst doing all the walking, I'd recommend you stop by and grab a slice of juicy delectable pizza from a Pezzo stall. The pizzas are fresh, not for a thin crust lover, but since I love my crust to be pan baked, they're perfect.
