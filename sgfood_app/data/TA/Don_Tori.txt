Authentic yet exploratory on the palate. Usually not fond of seafood but I'll order seconds here. Cocktails are excellent too but a few bottle of sake would suffice.

I had dinner here last month. They have really fresh sushi. The chef is really friendly and the staff are attentive. Tried a wasabi sour cocktail which I recommend

The food served was simply delicious. Every dish was pleasing. The of truffle or truffle oil was paired perfectly with Japanese cuisine. I will definitely return.

The Truffle Wagyu Foie Gras Don is an AMAZING umami bomb. And the service is impeccable. Definitely going back soon.

One of the best local Japanese joints. The atmosphere was super chill, the food was out of this world and the cocktails were perfect.

So yum! Don & Tori has something for everyone: the adventurous, the safety sushi lovers and the vegetarians! I highly recommend the Miso Eggplant, Salmon Carpaccio and the Mentaiko Prawns! The Guy Steak is also so juicy and I love the Sakura Ebi Angelhair pasta, so crisp and refreshing. The cocktails are a whole different level! Modern Japanese twists on classic favourites. The Bold Fashioned and Wasabi Sour are my recommendations and the Flower Fashioned is so light and floral, great for the afternoons!Ambience is perfect and the staff are so friendly! Let Chef Jack take care of you and he‚Äôll throw in a few surprises. Haran, head bartender, will also take care of your needs and entertain you with his quirks!Definitely a must go, again and again and again!

Was recommended by a friend who insisted i should check out this restaurant. So we did and no regrets!! When we arrived a member of their staff was really friendly and accomodating. We hadnt made any reservations and came at a time when the place was already full, so the he sat us down at the bar while we waited for a space at the omakase table. The cocktails served at the bar were superb - we were introduced to a range of japanese gin and whiskeys by the bartender who was knowledgable and chatty and able to make any cocktail according to your taste. When the time came for us to move to the omakase table, we were warmly greeted by the chef and the food just kept coming one after another and every single one was delicious and unique. You could tell the ingredients were of high quality and prepared with a great level of culinary skills. Personal favourite was the WAGYU BEEF BOWL. This is an absolute must-try!! Needless to say, by the end of it, 3 hours later, we were sufficiently tipsy and full. And later found out the guy that first greeted us was the owner or the restaurant. Such a nice guy!! The food & cocktails were all made with authentic japanese ingredients with a unique spin. Definitely going back to this magical place of amazingness.

Still a relatively new restaurant on Tras Street, but already killing it with their food. As a typical Singaporean, I love that they serve premium food items (such as sashimi/fish freshly flown from Japan and their ultra decadent truffle wagyu foie gras don) at a fraction of what you would otherwise have to pay at other similar restaurants.Been back here a few times and have never had a bad experience. The aforementioned wagyu rice bowl is a must, as is the homemade sesame ice cream and their fresh sashimi. I'm also a fan of their truffle salmon carpaccio as well as the classic negitoro maki - they make a mean version of it. Great spot for lunch if you work in the area, otherwise also a great spot for dinner and drinks especially on the weekends

Food there is real good, had the omakase menu didnt disappoint. Thou they could work on introducing their food a little clearer. At some parts it was so tasty but i don't know what I was eating! Anyhow, definitely worth a second visit, from what the chef tells me they change out their menu every once in a while depending on the seasons as a lot of their ingredients are air flown fresh from japan

This is a new Japanese restaurant on Tras Street . The decor is light , bright and welcoming - quite different from many other Japanese restaurants. Seating is comfortable , lighting is nice .Staff are attentive and able to explain dishes well. The sushi and sashimi options are varied and Plentiful - more importantly , very fresh and tasty. The sashimi platter of 10 pieces was a delightful combination of scallops , tuna, ebi and salmon - very fresh , no fishy smell .The angel hair pasta with dried shrimps is a show stopper - great taste , lovely combination of slightly crunchy pasta with the salty shrimp flavour topped with caviar ! However the next dish was even better - the Wagyu foie gras don buri- topped with an onsen egg- an amazing blend of sweet Wagyu, tasty foie gras and oozing egg yolk in a bowl of moist rice. An amazing Japanese dish - available on our table !For dessert we tried the black sesame ice cream - a solid scoop of ice cream with an abundance of sesame - all home cooked . Whilst the premier dishes may be a bit pricey , there are more than enough well priced items to have a very good meal . A very satisfying meal and we will surely return to try other dishes . It has good vegetarian options too.Good start for what promises to be amongst the better Japanese restaurants.

A definite go to place for delectable Japanese cuisine, coupled with a cosy ambience. Exquisitely prepared donburi bowls and maki which never fail to satiate my cravings. The Truffle Wagyu Foie Gras Don is a must have!

Small Japanese restaurant, with a great Omakase menu. I loved the Wagyu beef bowl and their fresh sashimi!
5
Great new place! The food was absolutely amazing, specially the prawns and eggplant! Great cocktails too üòÅ

If you try one thing - let it be the Truffle Wagyu & Foie Gras bowl! Great atmosphere - nab a table up at the bar to watch the chefs work their magic.

I enjoyed the chirashi don as it is very fresh. Whereas my friend ordered the grilled unagi don which was not flavorful enough. Could have been better though. However, service staff was attentive and very helpful. I will come back again.

Go to the bar, have an exquisite cocktail. Move on to the sushi bar, and enjoy chef jack's experience.

At first glance this feels like a high end japanese Restaurant. The setting is nice and spacious with the choice of booths, tables or bar dining. I came here for a lunch and although he sushi and sashimi dishes are a little at the high end, you can see this is the kind of place with high quality ingredients. But having said that, there was also very affordable options for lunch. I tried the chicken teriyaki don and I have to say it was excellent at only twelve dollars. The chicken meat was good quality and the serving was a good portion. It was also cooked very well and not too oily or over done with teriyaki sauce. The rice was light and fluffy and it was topped with a runny egg. Overall it was delicious and very good value for money. There was a lot more pricier items on the menu and they look like they‚Äôre worth trying if you fee like splashing out for lunch or dinner. A place I would recommend for those looking for a high quality don or tori for that matter

Our family of 6 had a most enjoyable dinner. We have the practice of rating a restaurant from scale of 1 to 10 after each visit to a new restaurant and my kids unanimously rated this a high 8! The atmosphere was stylish and sophiscated and yet family friendly. The trick was to separate the counter seats from the more family oriented table seatings. We like the extensive menu as it has everything for everyone from premium dinner dons to sushi and shasimi. This is a restaurant that clearly has a very good insight into consumer tastes as it extensive range of dons include all good value and well executed dons such as truffle gyu don and unagi don. Only disappointment was the rather pedestrian and pricey plain miso soup. Definitely a go back again place.

If you‚Äôre looking for a casual & good value for $$ modern Japanese cuisine, Don & Tori is THE place. Quality of food is excellent and as for service, I can‚Äôt ask for more. Attentive & friendly. Say hello to the chefs Jack and Isaac at the counter. They‚Äôre always making sure you‚Äôre pleased & comfortable with each order they dish out from start to the end.My fave dish must be their Wagyu Don w Foie Gras at $38. Great value. The quality of the meat is consistently good. I must have eaten at least 6 bowls in a span of 2 months. Their menu offerings cater to all budgets starting from $18 for a Don to a sashimi platter including Uni at $100. Like most Japanese restos, they serve up great Omakase too . Besides the delish food menu, they have a full bar & they‚Äôll gladly pair your food w drinks upon request. For those who drive, best to park at the Orchid Hotel. At least you‚Äôre assured of a parking lot. $3/entry after 6pm.

From the delectable donburis to fresh sashimi and homemade sesame ice cream, Don & Tori has all you want in a modern Japanese restaurant (and more). Be it for lunch or for dinner, the omakase experience or a simple lunch bowl, there's something for every time of day or week. Not to forget the creative cocktails and friendly wait staff who keep you wanting more. A great spot for fresh fish anytime of the week
