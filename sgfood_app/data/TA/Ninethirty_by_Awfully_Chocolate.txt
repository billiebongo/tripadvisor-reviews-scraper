This place is actually at the same place as Awfully Chocolate. Good Bacon and chunky eggs sandwich, and the skinny chocolate to drink. Good service and I always like the ambiance of this place.
5
Ninethirty is a place good for solos, couples, friends, families as they have different configurations to accommodate that. I loved the service provided; very efficient & attentive. The food was fabulous & beautiful.
4
Highly recommend. Both my mother and mother in law love the salad and grilled pork chop and the lovely dark chocolate cake
5
The food is really value for money. The staff is ever so pleasant...they know how to make you feel special!
Have eaten here many times...no regrets!
4
Tried the pork chop and Mac and cheese, really good choices! Of course many come for the chocolate desserts that this restaurant is famous for! After 6pm, 1-1 beers too.
5
Great ambience to chill with friends. Food quality exceeded my expectations and at a reasonably priced.
2
I liked the ambience, and the professionalism of the manager on duty was commendable. Unfortunately, that's all that was good. My entr√©e arrived 30 mins after my partner's, service staff brushed off repeated requests to clear the plates and serve dessert, and the chocolate cake dessert (supposedly one of their best) seemed like it was left out in the open for too long. For the price I was charged (>$100 for 2 pax), you can get better service at other establishments nearby. I would not recommend patronising
4
Visited this place on 1 Jan for brunch with my wife. We liked the relaxed ambience and interior. They have an extensive menu and everything looks so good we had a hard time deciding. My wife ordered the mac and cheese which is quite good. It comes with bits of bacon and they are very generous with the cheese. I had the pork chop which is tender and flavourful.
5
Pure chocolate heaven! Introduced to this restaurant by a Thai friend who loved it so much, it was considered a mandatory first stop on our first night in town. It is now a mandatory stop for me for all future visits to Singapore as well. Had a white hot chocolate and a piece of cake. Both were to next to heavenly. The ingredients used are good quality and the desserts are some of the best I‚Äôve had. The only change to my visit is that next time I would also eat dinner there as their main meals looked as wonderful as their desserts.
3
The ambience still a bit noisy , the music should be lower. You nearly have to shout to havea decent conversation ! This time my seat is just next to another table , I so afraid when the man coughing ! The staffs are quite friendly 
5
Lovely food, lovelier people! We had a hard time deciding which cake was the best because they were all so pretty, in the end, my date ordered the original cake and it's spectacular! We're looking forward to returning again
5
It has Lovely food and ambience as always. Is an excellent venue for brunch and has good value for money.
4
The deco was already very christmas-sy, a really lovely place to have a cup of coffee and watch the world pass by. Love the thick cut pork chops and mushroom crepe best
5
the atmosphere is cosy and warm
the desserts are the reason why i keep going back
and will continue to go back
5
Great and friendly service. Yummy spread. Cosy and comfy. Got the best seats! A selection of breakfast and of course all those chocolate desserts! üòã
5
The food exceeded our expectations, and so did the service from the staff members who were extremely welcoming! Highly recommended :-)
4
Service is good and the food is nice. However, price is on the high side given hawker style food. Ambience is cosy.
4
We had the ham and egg sandwich and the works (a breakfast dish). The sandwich came without eggs (and slaw!) but the crew kindly replaced it. We were also given two small chocolates in response to the misunderstanding. The lychee smoothie was not bad. The music was a little loud
3
The chocolate confectionery here is never a letdown. As a lover of almost all things chocolate and working for a company that makes and sells chocolate treats, I have to hand it to AwfullyChocolate for being consistent in the quality of their offerings.Why then the average rating, you ask? The service in this outlet has a lot of catching up to do with the chocolate delights that are prepared in a central kitchen offsite. When the young female staff are more focused with flirting with male customers rather than trying to serve the crowd and move the queue along, the customer experience suffers no matter how delicious the physical product is.As someone who√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a regular and from the neighbourhood, I implore the proprietors (who are just 1 street away btw) to give their staff some refresher training please
4
The first two time I visit Ninethirty was onSunday and Tusesday. I really enjoyed the food on Sun,, but not Tue, for when I brought my friends to go there again on Weekday, I found out they didn't serve a lots of food & drinks, only left a few choices. So sad ! Don't understand ! Is it they don't have enough customers during weekdays ? And also we felt the food a bit salty 
4
food was tasty, service could have been better as they seemed to be a little short handed when the cafe got a bit busier. pleasant service staff.
5
Fabulous service very efficient and friendly staff. Would definitely recommend this place for Brunch. Great menu too
4
Staff was extremely friendly n attentive even though they were busy. Scramble eggs were really fluffy and salad was flavourful. Portions were generous and quite value for money. Mocha royale was rich and truffle chocolate added even more flavour. Great ambience as well.
5
They might need more staff to take orders etc. Overall, the food and ambience are good~ I will go there again for sure.
5
Like best : Great service, delicious food, especially the truffle fries and pork chop, yummy dessert and our family totally enjoy our evening there

#batamliciouzinsg . Wahh I haven‚Äôt had this for a while. Usually I go to @awfullychocolatesg in @vivocitysg I just buy the cakes or chocolate truffles. But last night I came here after dinner at Sin Hoi Sai because it was just one block away. And so I had this and my mouth was bombed with this super strong chocolate milk flavor. For regular chocolate lover, this will be too much. For me, just nice! I love their cakes too‚ûñ‚ûñ‚ûñ‚ûñ‚ûñPRICE: $8.LOCATION: Nine thirty by @awfullychocolatesg- 131 East Coast Road, Singapore- Nearest MRT: Mountbatten.HOURS‚è∞:- M-T: 09:30 - 11:00- F: 12:00 - 01:00- Sat: 09:30 - 01:00- Sun: 09:30 - 11:00‚ûñ‚ûñ‚ûñ‚ûñ
3
Had 1 ribeye medium rare and 1 crabmeat spaghetti for sharing. Dessert was Praline. Of course, the dessert was good. The main dishes were okay, not that bad. The ribeye was a little too raw in the middle, but the outer side was spot on the medium rare. Will go back and try other food. Service was great.
4
Came by for sunday brunch. Food was great but it's the service staff that really made the dining experience great. We had pork chop, mac n cheese, truffle fries, choc banana cake and hei ice cream. It costs about $95 for two pax. Expensive meal but will come back again for a indulgent meal.
5
Love their cosy ambience, their main dishes was impressive too love their Laska toast but price is abit on the high end. I did quoted for a nice and cosy corner as is for my birthday celebration while making my reservation but wasn't given when I was there, this is where I would give a minus point for that.
4
We popped in here after dinner across the road and felt the need for something sweet. The flourless chocolate cake was fantastic, personally we weren't so keen on the white chocolate slice my partner got. The coffee was good and hot chocolate great. I would happily come back
3
Post lunch time rush, should not have service this poor. Need to stand up and get attention of the very skeletal wait staff. Terrible experience to get service but overall food was ok, and desserts are great.
5
The service is excellent that the service staff is able to provide a space for stroller upon requested. Food are delicious and nice ambience to hangout with friends.
4
Brought my parents here for a meal. They weren't impressed and found the food average for the price. Ambience was great though.
3
Good desert but very average food and below
The chocolate deserts and drinks if available are worth it
4
Cousin bring me there for dinner. We order Mac and cheeseüëçüèª(Must try), salmon & pork chop, all taste great. For dessert, we order Creme brulee & brownie, both were yummy.
Good service. Love the environment.
Will visit again.

I previously wrote a glowing review for this restaurant. However my following visit was a let down due to the inconsistent service. Lack of service has a flow on effect to how much I enjoy my food and overall experience, so therefore I felt the food wasn't as impressive as last time either. The atmosphere was also not relaxing and conducive to pleasant dining as the music was so loud that we practically had to shout to hear each other across the table. No greeting as we arrived this time. We had to find staff to let them know of our reservation which they didn't bother to look up. We were allowed to choose any table. Unlike last visit where staff were attentive, every time we needed attention to order or prompt someone to bring our wine, it was a struggle. We gave up asking for the water that we ordered because it was too much hassle trying to get someone's attention. I understand that Saturday night is a busy night, but you need to be attentive to your customers and look around to see who needs service. My husband ended up getting up from the table to grab 2 menus himself so we could order dessert. We were also left stranded waiting for 15 mins for our credit card after we gave it to the waiter to pay the bill. After noticing it had been sitting on the counter top at the front, we decided to go up ourselves and finish off the payment transaction as we had already waited so long and were ready to leave. The wait staff are not rude, they just lack attentiveness. Or perhaps more staff need to be employed so that they can be spread more evenly amongst the tables to ensure efficient service. I won't be going back on a Saturday night. Reserve visits for during the week if you don't want to be waving your hand about to be served
5
Arrived for dinner on a weekday evening with only but a few peeps but place was bustling and filled to the brim when I was about to leave. Food was good and service was better than expected too! Kudos to the manager for serving with heart and a smile
2
1. The place is full of waiters / waitress BUT yet service is so SLOW.2. Should learn what is Orders Checking from other restaurants, they have no system at all !!3. They just take your orders, and the rest is left to your luck on whether the food arrive or not.4. It took 30 minutes for our Cakes to come although the Bar staff is doing nothing !! All he has to do is just lift the cake from the tray and place on the plate and bring over and yet we have to chase 3 times.5. The Lemon Basil Cucumber drink is a total Disaster - very Salty !!
5
It's the first time I went to Nine Thirty not eating dessert. My friend and I shared a truffle fries and prawn aglio olio pasta. They were pretty generous with the portion of the food, we totally can't finish the fries thought it was good. Or maybe we spend too much time chatting.. But I'll come back again for sure, with dessert the next time
4
Ordered the pork chop and crab meat pasta for mains, and crab slaw and k-fries for sides. The mains and crab slaw was good! Love the chocolate desserts as well :) However, the manager seems to be unaware of our reservation under chope (we were not in the reservation list when we entered the restaurant). It will be good if there is better coordination between the manager/reservation system and the team
4
Management should be just a bit more attentive with their new staff on the ground to avoid mistakes.
3
Always visited the place for desserts. Decided to try out its dinner menu. It's better than expected.
5
Service was good and prompt.
Food is delicious. But I order rib eye steak, pork chop came instead...
3
It's a nice place to hang out....We were served by a very pleasant guy behind the counter
We got a tiramisu to go...it was delish....enough for two....as it's not cheap
Only for the chocaholics.....
3
Chocolate cake as good as I remembered it to be. Unfortunately, truffle fries weren't truffle-y at all. In addition, kitchen/staff made an error, tried to rectify it - wasn't to my expectation but appreciated the effort.
3
Food was above average, while portions were a bit small. However, service was extremely slow and unefficient
2
I tried their recommended, signature dish pork chop. It was bland and somehow dry. Hard to justify the S$22 price tag. Their chocolate drinks were disappointing. S$8 for a small glass of what they called iced white chocolate was insulting. It was melted vanilla ice cream with some crushed Oreos at best. Their chocolate drink, basically sweetened chocolate milk was also S$8, adding the 10% service charge and 7% tax. In sum, overpriced passable food. I did not appreciate either the staff trying to continuously push their truffle fries and insisting you get a dessert to go. Better give this place a pas
3
Really tasty, chocolaty cakes! But also not bad coffee, a very welcoming team of staff that were all pleasant when I arrived and when leaving. I went for breakfast and had the works, it was okay - nothing really special about it and it filled a gap, hence the average rating. But I would go back in the future but probably keep it to cake and coffee.
1
-Staff turn easy requests into complex problems that involve entire team.-There where 2 other tables occupied and the coffees took longer than the food-the kids knife and fork are actually sharper than the normal ones-service just over all poor-salt and pepper shakers have holes in the top that release stupid amounts of it content (this seams a small issue) I didn't lose my meal due to salt over pour, but seriously what the fark? -the coffee cups handles are designed for 2 year olds only -food average at best. Bacon and egg sandwich has 1.5 strips of bacon. Won't be bac
5
Go there quite often for desserts and this time round I tried out the brunch here with my friends. Food is delicious and hearty. Non-pretentious and it's packed with flavours. I had the ham and egg crepe and also the grilled cheese sandwich. The crepe was great and most importantly the sunny side up were cooked just right with the yolk still runny! Thee grilled cheese sandwich was alright, the mix of 3 different cheese gives a good depth to a simple dish but would have prefer a more melty consistency. Service was great although the place is a short of staff and can take some time to get their attention.
3
Food was mediocre
Desserts were good
Beverages grossly overpriced (seems to be a trend in Singapore)
Service was slow and inattentive
Interiors were modern and rather quait.
You decide. But to us it was an average experience
5
This cafe serves both meals and desserts. The chicken salad, mac and cheese, and truffle fries are good. For dessert, you can't miss the hot chocolate and tiramisu.
4
price abit expensive but the desert is good. highly reccomed smores. atmosphere suitable for younger audience (aged below 50)
4
Had breakfast with toddler and friends on a Sunday morning. Fantastic cakes - we had the stack and the flourless chocolate cake. Coffee was like flavoured milk. Juices good.
5
I'm amazed by how friendly are their service! It is definitely one of the best I ever had. Foods are great as usual.
3
Nice and cosy ambience. Service was not bad. Waiting time for food to come is average. Curry fries were way too salty, do not order this if u are not a fan of salty stuffs, we have a hard time trying to finish up this dish.
5
An affordable place suitable for casual dining and romantic dates. Menu features a wide array of food items (all-day breakfast included), alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks (1-for-1 beers anyone?), and desserts that can tame even the fussiest of eaters. Steak lovers should just go straight for the Steak and Eggs, which by the way has some awesome buttered potatoes as a side dish. Though understandably busy at times, I was impressed by the impeccable service provided by the restaurant staff. Its relatively inconvenient location is but a slight blot on an otherwise fantastic dining outlet
5
The improvement in service & the new menu are a winning combination for this hipster style establishment. The moment you walk in the door you are greeted with a hello! The very personable table service sets this place apart from the many similar restaurants in the area & the food is delicious & well priced for what you get to savour. My only concern is my waistline, which may slowly begin to expand if I frequent this restaurant too often! The divine desserts are a wicked pleasure of mine! Well done guys! Keep up the great service
3
maybe i chose the wrong items. the beef steak was tough despite it being medium rare and got tired chewing on it. service was the only saving grace as it was still quite friendly although very slow on a weekend as it wad crowded. will not be coming bac
5
Not always a new restaurant makes an impression, but Nine Thirty far exceeded my expectations. Food;I always study the menu before I visit a new restaurant, and the two items I tried, Scrambled Eggs for Brunch and Prawn Aglio Olio for Dinner, and they were just perfect. Quality of the coffee is also top class.Service;I guess the team is friendly, efficient and on the ball, mainly driven by Samantha's energy (I think she is group head of operations). She never stops, never looks tired and always helping out guests with a big smile!Ambiance;The d√É¬©cor is simple, bare concrete floor, casual furniture and had a great Napa type of buzz at during the hours I spent on that rainy wet and balmy Saturday. Music was well curated, and I must say this is one of those rare places you really feel like home
4
Trendy, youthful place to meet convenient to East Coast activities.
soft American rock playing keeps up atmosphere
Service and presentation well done
But note: seats hard, don't invite really long stays...
Also, they only serve their fancy juice concoctions on weekends -- seems a pity!
4
Our first visit to Nine Thirty. Service & food are good. A good place to relax & catch-up with friends.
4
Food was so good. Highly recommended for gatherings:)
The only thing was that the waiting time was kinda long when you're hungry, about 45mins despite not being crowded on that day.
5
Quiet dining place with good variety of food especially for hangouts with vegetarians.
The starters portion was good for sharing.
2
The food was barely passable. Even their famous Hei ice cream was icy and not well scooped. Will not visit again.
5
Excellent place for after dinner dessert & drinks. It's usually quite full, so a slight wait can be expected.
Hard to finish more than a single dessert in one sitting.
Service is excellent, and staff are very courteous.
4
Very nice ambiance. Menu looks a bit limited but food was delicious - we tried salmon miso, fish and chips and mussels and all were great! We had French toast for dessert and it was also very good and big enough to be shred amongst 3
4
The service was great even though it was very busy when we visited very late on Thursday night. The chocolate dish we tried was very sweet but very nice. The special Singapore themed drinks were very nice and the waiter was very kind to recommend them to us
5
This particular branch along Joo Chiat Road is my favorite place to hang out and/or to work. Although it can sometimes get really crowded, the customer turnover is fast enough. And it's open 'til quite late.My menu favorites here are the white chocolate creme brulee, their chocolate truffles and their house ice cream - very creamy dark chocolate. The coffee is good too though not exceptional. The din is such that when everyone is talking at the same time, I don't really hear individual conversations (unless of course I'm zooming in on a particular one). The service here is quite good, too (I'm talking about you, Terence!). Truth is, I'm almost reluctant to write this because then everybody will discover my secret and this place might end up even more packed than it is now. (Yes, I'm writing this review from here.)On the downside, especially if you're looking to do your work here, there are not enough power outlets. And no wifi (really? in the 21st century?)
1
We are regular customers of this cafe, with having our weekend evenings settling for delicious cakes and cuppa.However, we are very disppointed with the bad service and long waiting time, left me wondering if wearing a tuxedo or gown would surprisingly enhance the service towards me.Oh then i realize that i had to pick a clean table or else your busy staff would have think that i already placed my order n enjoying my meal already
5
Great location, ambience & food. Fantastic place to catch up with friends. Love the creativity with choclate and service.
Must try. They have quite a few outlets across Singapore.
4
nice food, good atmosphere, spacious enough so that the next table won't be too close. a little pricey
4
Mostly there for their Awfully Chocolate cakes, ice cream, pastries and desserts. A nice place to chill out at night.
5
Fantastic place. Fantastic food and even fantastic desserts! Don't miss out on the curry crab ramen and poached chocolate.
4
Staff were very polite and friendly. Good food and quiet ambience although in the early evening. Would recommend to others.
4
Friendly staff in this European meets Asia-with-a-twist style eatery. Thought it was all about chocolate which it isn't. Will go back for the all day brunch next time.
4
Good ambiance for a great meal! Service is 8/10 Food is not bad but don't miss the chocolate! Price is mid-level. Â•ΩÁéØÂ¢É‰∏çÈîôÁöÑÊúçÂä°ÂíåÈ£üÁâ©Ôºå‰∏çË¶ÅÈîôËøáÈùûÂ∏∏Â•ΩÂêÉÁöÑÂ∑ßÂÖãÂäõÔºÅ‰∏≠Á≠â‰ª∑Ê†º„ÄÇ

Me and my husband visited this place only once. I liked the concept of cafe/confectionary + restaurant in slightly industrial black&white space. However, the restaurant food was just average. We wanted to try some desserts after (they have about 20 chocolate things in the menu) but directly after the meal, we were brought a birthday cake. We told them during booking that it was a birthday dinner but we didn't order the cake. As we thought that it was a complimentary cake and a nice gesture from the company, we ate it but then we were charged for it. Quite disappointing. The staff was very friendly and polite though
4
Came here with my best friend for dinner on Wednesday. Not sure how this is in the weekend; It was quiet and we can enjoy our dinner in a relaxing setting. Ordered mussel soup to share and mushroom noodle. Ended off with chocolate ice cream which is always nice but sinful. Food is good. Price is reasonable. Nice place to relax with friends.
4
The lamb chops were perfect and filling! The cold cacao was Yums and so was the hot chocolate. The seats are quite uncomfortable but it's such a cosy and quaint lil place to just chill. The music could be a bit softer as we did have to speak quite loudly to be heard.The service was slow
4
Visited this place as we were staying just down the road in the holiday inn express. Lovely modern restaurant with nice staff. Choc deserts to die for. Very unhealthy just so you know! ;)
5
Never liked custard and cr√®me Brule but have to thank this place for bringing the twist that I like. Layering the top with white chocolate, made me a regular.
4
Went for family lunch. Enjoyed the sesame tofu salad and classic burger! Very delish.
Service was fast and the ambience was nice.
4
Had lunch here recently and crab ramen was amazing. The grilled fish was cooked well but nothing to blow your mind.
I've had desserts from this outlet on many occasions with my favourite being the praline tart which is rich and decadent.
5
One stop for Asahi on tap to burgers, bites, cocktails or rather choctails, mouthwatering desserts, dark chocolates, ice creams and the works.
3
Bacon and egg bowl was average and plain (overpriced at $16 for the quality presented), Laksa Tagliatelle was a tad too rich although mussels were fresh (again, overpriced at $22). I would stick with the ice cream and cakes and skip the food next time.
3
I am an avid chocoholic and have been a big fan of all their chocolate stuff since day one, nine thirty has expanded to include decent grub and I enjoy their burgersI am writing this review as I know the owner to be a very friendly lady who takes feedback seriouslyShe is one of the few restaurant/cafe owners who makes every effort to employ a mostly singaporean staff and must be commended for this, if only more owners are like her realising we are sick of being attended to by Indians/China/ especially Filipino staffActually their desserts/cakes deserve six stars but this one Filipino male waiter so angered me on my last visit that I wanted to go back another day and use foul language on him, that's how angry he made meFilipinos if you want to know the real them just visit Dubai where they form the service population, the ones there are a true reflection of the real Filipinos and in Singapore we need to make sure they don't reach that level or better still stop employing themThat incident, he forgot my order and when I politely asked about it even using the phrase excuse me boss, he gave me a look, said ' of course it's coming' practically slammed the plate on my table shocking my mild mannered companion and even forgot to bring cutlery for both of us, madam owner please sack him immediatelyThe rest of the local staff are cheerful and bubbly, I love the chocolate items there so if I ever go again I think instead of sitting i better just take it awa
3
Ordered the $11 one egg soup. The whole meal came. Still not here. Order was forgotten obviously but no basic courtesy to inform and apologize. Always cant get servers attention because they are not too attentive. Thought the server saw my hand, as she looked over. But nope because she was not sure if she saw correctly. But doesnt come over to confirm that. Which is what service is all about. Burgers come with fries. You would expect quite a lot when they state roasted fries. We had chosen garlic and curry fries. To my dismay, it's just powdered fries which are so so salty I cant even eat half. The tandoori chicken was nice. The beef was nice. But the fries, no. Wouldnt expect much from their truffle fries.Ordered cocoa mocha. It came in hot when I thought I've ordered iced. So after talking to waitress she said will change it for me. Turns out, by simply adding some ice... However when bill comes we were charged a dollar for ice. Without being informed. Another service lacking area. Not coming back again
3
This place serves awesome deserts. However the service is very poor. We kept looking for someone to take our orders. Finally at 10 I approached the cash counter to place my order & the lady said last order was at 0945. All we had wax the fries which were average and way under cooked. The only thing I truly like here so far is their deserts & chocolates.
5
Undoubtedly, one of "the best" espressos in Singapore. I have been an espresso drinker all my life and the espresso at awfully chocolate (east coast road) is the "real deal" and the great thing is, that the Barista is able to maintain the consistency in taste and body on each and every single occasion that I have had my caffeine fix and that is exactly what is phenomenal about their coffee. You must give it a try if you are an espresso lover. The long black (Americano) is equally good. If you are a tea drinker, then they got a wide range of teas for you as well. The desserts at awfully chocolate are simply superb too. My vote goes to the hazelnut crumble, salted butterscotch brownie and dark chocolate truffles ... absolutely super and just perfect taste!!The staff is very professional, attentive and the service is quick. I am hooked to this place. Keep it up people, you are doing great!
3
Food is average. Cakes are nice ... Very rich and fulfilling. Recommended to come here for cakes and a cup of coffee if you are around here.
5
Had famous chargrilled pork chop tasted like beef! Very original and scrumptious and caramelised onions was absolutely complementing! Their one and only One Egg soup was delicious which I would recommend. Service was genuine and prompt. Ambience was cafe-styled with many seats.
3
Food was decent. Ambience was cosy.
Though a tad disappointed that the Breakfast spread and shakes were not available, but overall dining experience wasnt too bad. Staff were friendly.
2
Small portions,although the pork chop and fries were decent. The mussels and salmon pasta tasted diluted and odd - abit too sourish for our taste. With the many eateries nearby, we won't need to come here again.
5
Brought my boyfriend to Ninethirty for a birthday dinner. Price wise, each dish is very reasonably priced and the portion is just nice too. We had the one egg soup, curry crab ramen and the pork chop. We were very pleased with the taste of the food and service was quick as well! Will definitely recommend people to visit Ninethirty and will go back again
5
I mean who does not love chocolates? We had the white choco creme brulee, OMG to die for, sooo good. My daughter had the long slice of chocolate and it was equally as good as the creme brulee, would be bringing my family here when we visit Singapore again. Highly recommende
3
Food was good though somewhat overpriced. Mentioned I made a booking through Chope but the cashier said she'd never heard of it. But we were ushered in and had a nice setting. Fries were good - not too oily, and not too salty, though I think the fries that came with the pork chop deserve special mention for the special way it is prepared - especially thick and long, with skin at the ends, and sprinkled with some smoked bacon flavoured seasoning. We ordered truffle fries as appetizer, but that was some mistake the waitress taking my order could have advised, because everything else we ordered came with fries came later, so it became some fries overload. I tend to think that eateries along East Coast tend to like employing young energetic people to cater to serving hip and possibly more well to do expatriates living in that area. However some basic courtesies and service mind-set tend to thrown out ever so quickly. Perhaps it is a manner of self-protection against potential abusive customers, but overall thus tends to put me off as a first time customer. Not to mention the search for parking has already struck it off on our mental list of places to return to.
4
Delicious Carbonara pasta, Chilli crab Ramen, Pork chop and Laksa Ramen.Our table of four enjoyed the food very much, however the service could be improved. We had to seek out the waiter to order main and coffee and to get the bill. If they were more attentive they may have sold another round of drinks. However the food was so good they still get four stars. We will go back and if you go do try the peanut butter coleslaw and a Katong Jelly
4
Visited here recently for desert and coffee after dinner at Alibarbar Hawker Bar across the road which is also worth a visit. We were 10 in our group and we had a good time with the delicious deserts (chocolate tarts, hazelnut brownies, etc) and teas and coffees. Service was good and had no problem getting waiter and waitress to take two separate group photos. Awfully Chocolate is well known for its cakes, etc and this outlet is a good place to sample them.
5
Regular in this place for the last couple of years. Like the space and staff who are friendlyFavourite is Creme of Brulee, Chocolate Cake, and Dark Chocolate Truffles. Creme of Brulee is my favourite in this place thought in the last 2 times have had to ask them to make the sugary layer more crispy by re-heating it again.The Tiramasu is super heavy and requires 2-3 folks to savour and enjoy it!Overall a fantastic place to have dessert and coming out feeling satiated and at peace with this world! 
5
Ate the pork chops and Laksa tagliatelle
Almost every dish was done till perfection and lots of pride in it !
"Hei" Ice cream was also decadently thick and rich..
3
I find their much talk about chocolate cake ordinary and too pricy.
The other section has quite a crowd gathering for western food.
A good place for camaraderie.
4
A good place to be sinful. Love their butterscotch white chocolate. Nice cafe ambience and attentive staff.
2
The cakes and coffee would be one of the best I've tasted. The service was absolutely shocking. Very very slow. I asked for water and even after sitting there for an hour. Nothing. Waited and waited and waited, for menu, meals, drinks, bill and change. I would've given a 5 except service really let this place down.
5
Great place, always busy but never had a problem getting a table. Chocolate ice cream is a must, but for me, this place is all about the Salted Caramel Brownie. My only request would be to put a vanilla ice cream on the menu to cut through some of the rich chocolate desserts.

I moved back to Katong early in Jan 2015 and despite always seeing a Q to get in never really attempted it, especially after I read some reviews that service was slow....however I went into the dessert area recently and just had to try the only ice cream they serve which is chocolate.The first mouthful just blew me away for several reasons.....the richness in the cocoa flavour, just the right sweetness , great colour, and thick texture .I am not a ice-cream connoisseur, but with what is now available in Singapore i think one can make a reasonably good assessment. To test my finding I did ask several friends to taste and all agreed with the finding , including my two Irish cousins ....At $5/- a single scoop, not cheap but cheaper than many other higher priced brands not worth the $$ you pay

I am in a food coma - ate too much but oh so delicious. Should not have ordered the Gula Melaka Jackfruit shake it filled me up before the food arrived. I had the braised beef followed by the Chocolate Praline Cake. Simply delicious and so many interesting items on the menu that I will have to go back and try all of it.Excellent place for lunch, coffee & cakes, dinner or brunch

We found this place when we were walking down from the Katong Mall. Never knew Awfully Chocolate has a restaurant-like ambiance and this place was perfect for groups of friends to have a good chat and spend Friday evenings. Although a bit expensive, their service and the staff make up for it

If you are a chocolate lover this place will be heaven for you but even if you just come for the food you won't be disappointed.Young staff who are very hip and chatty serve up good modern dishes with a smattering of traditional dishes. Good service and good sized meals with a 2 for 1 offer on some of the drinks. It can get quite busy but it's worth it to see how Singaporeans have a good time

With a name like Awfully Chocolate, how can a chocoholic not be drawn to the restaurant? While not the best chocolate cake I've ever had, this chocolate cake is moist and chocolately. It is delicious and sure to satisfy almost any chocolate craving.

Had the fluffy pancakes and they were the best I've ever had! The flat white coffee and layered chocolate cake were good, too. Friendly service.

I went twice to this outlet and tried their cakes n hot white chocolate drink.
But consume in moderation becos of sweet calories piling up though.
The service staff are young n pretty efficient.
The sad thing is they don't offer free
wifi.

visiting this joint for the first time. Good atmosphere, although the flooring can be improved. The tiramisu was of good quality. The chocolate martini was average. Would recommend this place to chocoholics.

Went there in the afternoon during my break to have something to drink and ended up having a cuppa coffee plus a slice of their chocolate cake with rum and it was like heaven!

A friendly restaurant that is particularly known for its desserts and ice creams with people seeming to come in for a dessert after eating elsewhere. I have eaten main courses there three times in the last month and can't fault the meals. Service is good, the staff are young and they have a buy one get one free offer on Asahi beer. What's not to like?

My Singapore friends new my love of chocolate and chose this especially for a dessert visit. It was everything I had hoped for and more. I had a chocolate martini with the stacked chocolate cake and some of the homemade ice cream. Everything was silky smooth and delicious. I know now why there was a long wait for a table. My only complaint/suggestion is that the chocolate banana cake is not sold by the slice by only as an entire cake
5
The desserts are awesome, look tempting & taste is sinful! Tried the chocolate double stack bar pastry and it has to be one of the best chocolate creations.... This place has loads of options to engage in, just pick up a seat by the window and enjoy the merries of the world...

Went there today, Dec 27, 2014 - saturday night, luckily we came around 7.30 PM and dont have to queue. We ordered burger, pancakes, pork chop and the food were good. Then came the dessert session. Should try Hazelnut Crumble with ice cream - promoted to be #1 best selling dessert by the manager and it was HEAVEN. Not too sweet, the cake was just right and the ice cream was special (claimed to be made by themselves). Then the crowd started to come around 8.30-9.00 PM. and all tables are full. Even queue to be wait to be seated. Located in front of Katong 122, an interesting neighbourhood to satisfied your culinary curiosity

When it was first opened, there wasn't much pork in the dishes so I was still able to try a few of the dishes. I was pretty happy that they had Muslim diners in mind as they were preparing the menu. However over time, those options disappeared. They created new dishes but with pork in almost all of it. So were the old dishes. It was very disappointing coz they no longer cared about the non pork diners.

We picked up a chocolate cake for a birthday party and it was a slice of heaven. I don't care for chocolate cake it this was like nothing I've ever had before. Cannot speak regarding the food or drinks there but the cake. Omg.

Other food is expensive though. But their chocolate ice cream is really super smooth n rich. One scoop will be satisfying to one's stomach. My daughter n I love the cutie spoon very much. ><

no Internet, no service, terrible food, go the opposite side of the road BORZEIT a very good, honest no pretense not cheap but great value for money.

Perfect if you are a chocolate lover. However, after having the chocolate cupcake, the chocolate ice cream and the chocolate milk, it was a bit too much for me.

Was there on a late night with my missus. Chocolate tart was pretty gd but the salted butterscotch was our favorite. The kahlua baileys double shot coffee is thumbs up too.
3
Bad service. Grabbed our own menus and tables. Mashed potatoes was served cold, gravy too salty. Asked for menu again to order dessert but was completely forgotten. Not even worth the service charge I feel! Only memorable thing was the Super Stacked Chocolate Cake.
3
Dark chocolate (drinks) doesn't taste like dark chocolate at all. Desserts that recommended by the waiter (was told best selling) not really good also. Overall ok and good services :)

My friends and I tried ordered a few dishes - truffle fries, disco fries, fish and chips. duck confit pasta and salmon pasta.The servings for the fries were generous and we found it a challenge finishing up 2 servings shared between 6 of us. The truffle fries were rather salty, unfortunately. The disco fries, however, were absolutely scrummy!The duck confit pasta was slightly oily in my opinion, but it was satisfying, with a generous amount of duck.The salmon pasta had a rather unique taste which grew on me. My friends and I formed divided opinions on it. The fish and chips (truffle fries) was a great dish served with garlic dip. Again, the serving for this was pretty generous. Dessert was a hit with all of us! The chocolate ice cream and the super stacked chocolate cake were simply divine and lived up to expectations. Would definitely return for dessert

I walked in to this cafe to get away from the heat and humidity, and at first glance it seemed promising. I can appreciate the limited menu though the drinks menu was reasonably attractive. The tandoori chicken was a lot of lettuce and rocket leaves, the chicken pieces were few and did not taste like tandoori....it was awfully sweet. I did enjoy the rich pandan leaves with coconut milk smoothie. I was tempted to try the dessert but decided against it.....as I diid not wish to wait. while the service was polite, it was a tad overly casual and slow....about 8 mins to get attention and pay the bill. It could have been managed better given the number of staff I observed. Overall a bit at the high price range for what you get. I rather pay more for better food and service

I attended this eatery with a view to selecting cakes to have for a birthday party, as they offer both take away and dine in.Excellent selection of chocolate cakes, and all reasonably priced by Singapore standards. Good ambiance, attentive service and great air conditioning ‚Äì just what you need. The coffee was first rate, decorative and excellent to wash down the chocolate cakes.Butterscotch and caramel loaf was my favorite.Staff very helpful with advice for birthday cakes, and free decorations and candles provided.You wouldn‚Äôt want eat too much chocolate for obvious reason, but a great place for a sweet moments!!!Highly recommended

Cakes are nice and the coffee reasonable...but service is very slow and wait staff tend to ignore customers

Ate there last night during F1. Food was average for the price. We both commented that we wished we ate at the food stands at the track instead
4
The title seems to be a common theme. We just had dessert and when it finally arrived it was wonderful but we declined coffee and in the end wished we had ordered some so we had something to do while we were waiting. We only ordered basic dishes but they took a fair while to get there. Otherwise fine

I spent an afternoon here for dessert and tea and I really enjoyed my serving of cake and ice cream. And their peppermint tea. Their chocolate cake is richly decadent. It's almost like diving into several layers of chocolate. The service staff was pleasant and the manager even apologized for the restaurant being so busy. We spent over two hours there and the staff didn't bother us or made us feel like we were overstaying. They were pleasant when we requested for more hot water to steep our tea in. I thought it was a great place to spend an afternoon in with friends. Definitely worth the visit to try their chocolate

Over CNY the restaurant was open but they should have closed it. We were dissapointed in the past but this day it reached its peak. 3 days old gone salad, grey old smelly chicken and dreadfully bad service to just mention a few of the problems. We complained without any positive outcome. No one seems to care about food quality or service anymore. For a restaurant to change the head chef and menu several times in just a few month is a bad sign but seriously... any 711 burger is more honest than the food we got. Apart from the desserts dont bother ordering anything

I have visited NineThirty by Awfully Chocolate both at East Coast and in Esplanade (which for some reason is not listed here) on both occasions i wished i hadn't.They entice you with great looking cakes and chocolate but every time the taste does not match the presentation.Maybe it's a Singaporean thing, they love their cakes and desserts but these just don't do it for me. Even their hot chocolates didn't taste right on both occasions. I tried two kinds and two desserts but left both, My friends did the same. They all said it sounds great but what happened.....Staff in Esplanade were quick and good, East Coast less so.Won't be getting me or my friends back for a third time..

The menu looks very interesting, mainly european dishes. We had a chicken salad and honey glazed ham steak which was on offer for 20$. To be honest steak was ok but the salad, was 12$ and it although it supposed to have avocado and apple, it was honestly a handfull of greens, 3 pieces of chicken, 3 vey hin slices of an overripped apple and a tiny bit of avocado. The service was very good tho..

The Fusion food; satay chicken ciabatta sandwich, tandoori chicken salad et al is imaginative and overall pretty good and they have a fairly extensive menu with pastas, all day breakfast and a lot of good old staples like pork-chop, fish & chips and the likeThe best part particularly if you are in the neighborhood and looking for substantial grub beyond 10.30 then this is pretty much the only place. It's a fairly popular place with a lot of buzz but you do end up getting a table. They have got a decent bar with draft beer and the best part of course is great awfully chocolate deserts!The service crew is usually pretty enthusiastic and charged up though it can bra tad erratic which is not a big surprise in Singapor

Previously this used to be one of our favourite places for breakfast in the East, however, based on todays experience we will not be returning.The service used to be excellent but today the staff seemed to have no idea how to deal with what seemed to be a relatively small number of customers. Basic training is required particulalrly in customer service.The major issue was we ordered two breakfasts and one came out almost immediately and after my partner had finished her breakfast mine had still not appeared. When I queried this I was never given an answer and when we saw another table being served their food after they had arrived well after us we chose to cancel that meal and requested the bill. This also didnt apear in a reasonable time so chose to go up and pay only to discover the item had not been taken off.Looking around we were clearly not the only table that had a long wait for food service. It was clear that many tables had one person eaiting their food a long time while the other waitedOther issues - Water - for the prices they are charging this should be offered automatically and topped up regulalrlyCappucino - $7 it would want to be pretty good - it was OKMusic - good quality but too loudI dont know want happened to all your service staff but it has gone down hill badly.Overall you spoiled my breakfast and you need to know I was not happy

Only stopped for a light tea as I was here to buy a banana chocolate cake. Had the Stack o Pancakes. Said I didn't want the fresh cream but it still came on the plate, anyway. It was a terribly average pancake stake. Dry. The banana that came with it looked quite awful. Didn't look fresh. Wasn't worth the $16. The iced lemon tea fared better. Wouldn't return to eat here. Thought better of this restaurant, given that it's part of the Awfully Chocolate family. Well, I was wrong.
