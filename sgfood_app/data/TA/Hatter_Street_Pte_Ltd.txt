Even after moving away from Hougang, we still come back to visit this place every now and then. The mixture of Pandan Icecream + waffle + Gula Melaka sauce is amazing!
The waffle is always done to perfection!
Keep it going, guys!

Small and cozy cafe with nice waffle. I love their waffle with maple syrup. Crispy and not so sweet. The have limited ice cream selection but they have Pandan and Gula Melaka which were not bad.

We always frequent Hatter Street for their waffles. They are one of the best we've had in Singapore. It is a very small cafe with limited seating, so do go early if you can.

This place attempts to be different with the Hatter (from Alice in Wonderland) outlook, however there are evident signs of tiredness of the place/ambience/furniture.
However the coffee and brownie cake that we ordered were decent!!!
This place is more for the Hougang locality....

Hatter Street has a quaint old world feel to it. I love the quotes they have up on the walls. They have a limited menu, which is generally indicative of good quality to me - you do a couple of things and do them really well! We had a Whoaffle (Waffles-Lavender Ice Cream-Toasted Marshmallow Ice Cream). We also wanted to try the Pistachio Latte but they didn't have it that day.The Waffle was just right - crisp on the outside, fluffy inside. The Lavender Ice Cream was really creamy and light. The plate was well presented and the portion was deceptively heavy

After dinner, we intended to have dessert at a MxDonalds nearby but seeing this shop, we decided to give it a try.They had cakes on display near the entrance which looked good but we ended up deciding on a waffle with ice cream on top instead.It wasn't a wrong choice at all!The waffle was buttery and crispy while the ice cream (we chose pandan and black sesame-tofu flavours) was smooth but not too sweet. Being not too sweet, it left a light feeling balancing the buttery waffle.Worth trying

I am not much of an ice cream junkie, but I did enjoy myself with the flavour tasting. Not a huge range of selection, but nonetheless, you should be able to find something you like.Price wise is OK, not too expensive, and scoop serving is pretty generous. Good service standards too.

Although the place deco & selection looks ok, but there was nobody serving and we had to clear the table on our own.The aircon didn't seem to be working and there's no wifi included. If you find these to be critical, you may consider skip this place

After having a lousy dinner @ knuckles, we decided to go for dessert that have not let us down since the first time we try it.Ordered their "Just, Snicker" and their "Alice". Just, Snicker is very rich in taste and kind of chocolatey and i personally like it a lot! Recommended! "Alice" comes with a choice of 1 scoop of ice cream. Goes quite well with the vanilla ice cream with salted caramel. If you eat the cake separately, it tasted like an eggy "Huat Kuey" which slightly sweeter. Quite nice thoughLastly we had Chocolate Cookie Latte recommended by the cashier. Not a bad choice. Not too sweet after having a few mouthful of cakes. Hahahaha! Will recommend this place to others. Pricing is quite reasonable too.

We liked the crispy texture of the waffle and the wide selection of ice-cream available to go with it. A rather popular cafe in the heartlands and the waffle is likely the main draw.

Read about the review and decide for meeting the Friend of having dessert after our dinner at Nakhton Kitchen, nice panda ice cream with waffle worth for a tea break or dessert after dinner :)

Love the waffle with ice cream, price is reasonable. But too much people have to wait for seats. The red velvet is nice too.

Good place to hang out, love their waffles and the casual atmosphere. Seats are difficult to find at times though. Some say can fight with creamier.

They call their Waffles , 'Woaffles' and rightly so. The waffles are crispy, light and just the right amount of sweet. We had ours with salted caramel sauce and vanilla ice cream and absolutely loved it! The restaurant interiors are designed as per the Alice in Wonderland theme and I loved the details, with the small door and the Big Hat outside

To admit, I have been here umpteen times. My favourite is the Pandan waffles with Gula Melaka sauce. This is the best combination I have tried so far.In terms of waffles, Hatter Street produces the most unique taste and texture waffles. I have never tried such awesome waffles in Singapore. This is the top reason why I was always back here for dessert. Not to mention, it was rather close to Kovan MRT. No issues on accessibility!As for the pandan ice cream, it was not super creamy and it was very very light. Great for ladies and it gave me the illusion that I could eat more without gaining more calories.Lastly for the Gula Melaka sauce, it really goes will with pandan ice cream. A perfect match! Oh well, they have many other ice cream flavours and sauces which you can mix and match. But my favourite is still the one which I have mentioned above. Definitely will be back for more!!!

I've heard alot about Hatter Street for years and I've always wanted to go visit Hatter Street, but it was only because of my recent trips to the area that I decided to give it a shot. There's lots of HDB parking in and around the area of Hatter Street. There's even a bus stop right in front of the cafe. i've visited Hatter street twice on a weekday night and at around 8pm or so, it was packed, with people waiting for seats.Hatter street serves coffee, ice cream and waffles and a small selection of cakes. Some of the cakes like brownies are placed in the cake display on the right. But fancier cakes like rainbow cake is placed right at the cashier, to catch your attention. They're around $7.50 per slice of cake.While making payment for my whoaffles, I decided to go for the vibrantly coloured rainbow cake. It wasn't part of the plan but, it was too pretty to say no to!1. Rainbow CakeThe top of the rainbow cake looked like it was painted with ink splattered all over the top covered with a glossy almost gelatin light layer. It was truly pretty. The top was mainly cream cheese. But since the cake didn't sit in the cake display which was a fridge, it may have affected the taste of the cake. My fellow gilr friends and I felt that it was abit dry and we didn't finish the cake at all. The cream cheese was dense and too sweet for my liking. The cream cheese did carry a strong sweet fragrance with it.2. Whoaffles with Pandan ice cream and Butterscotch Espresso Sauce $9.50Upon the first bite into the whoaffles, I knew I was sold! The waffles were so crispy on the edges and yet light and airy on the inside. The waffle itself has a slight sweetness to every bite and had a buttermilk aroma. The pandan ice cream tasted literally like kaya and it was smooth, creamy with a dose of coconut sweetness. The waffles are served with some fruits on the side for decoration and the selection of fruits paired well with the waffle. I choose to go with butterscotch espresso so I had never tried such a sauce before. It was thick, sticky and definitely well-named. The name itself describes exactly how it tasted. The espresso aftertaste was very fitting for the pandan ice cream. Overall, this is my favourite combination!3. Whoaffles with Blue Peppermint and Caramel sauce $9.50The blue peppermint ice cream caught me eye at the ice cream counter right at the cashier. They are very generous with their scoops of ice cream and do not be afraid to ask for a taster before settling down on your choice of flavours. The staff are very friendly indeed! The smooth texture of the peppermint ice cream had tons of little minty chocolate embedded all over. The ice cream was drizzled with caramel sauce that brought the ice cream to a whole new level. The caramel sauce compensated the ice cream with its fragrance and aroma of caramel sweetness.Overall : A great place for really really really good crispy waffles and ice cream. Friendly staff to help you along the way of choosing an ice cream flavour or sauce topping. Not too ulu a location to get t

Looking a cafe that you can bring your grandparents to as well as get your fix of waffles? Then this quaint little cafe in Hougang (Kovan MRT) is the place. Besides you standard fare of waffles with ice cream like Salted Caramel, the chef has cooked up Bean Curd ice cream, Chin Chow ice cream, Holick and even Milo flavoured ice cream. Something which the Pioneer generation would approve of. The cafe can be packed to the brim so please be prepared

I always come here whenever I have a craving for waffles, or when I'm around the area. I love their waffles with pandan ice-cream x gula melaka, and sawdust pudding! I tried their waffles with vanilla ice-cream x salted caramel too, but i still find the pandan ice-cream the best. The staff here are friendly and polite, once they forgot my order, but made it up by serving my friends & me an extra scoop of pandan ice-cream. ;

Pandan Ice Cream with Gula Melaka. That was really good waffles and ice cream. It's crispy and tasty and worth trying. The place is pretty small and has limited seating, sometimes you'll have to queue to get a table. It is self-service there as with many other cafe nowadays in Singapore. This is located at the foot of HDB flats. The downside is that it is pricey, all the waffles and ice cream cost more than $10. Also, be there some time before it closes as I saw potential customers turned away by staff almost 30 minutes before closing time
