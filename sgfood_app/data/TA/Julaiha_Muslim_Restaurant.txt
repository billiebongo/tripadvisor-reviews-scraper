The prata here is freshly prepared and more often than not their plain prata is crispy compared to some other places that you try which would be soggy because they left it there for some time. Space is large enough to cater to a bigger audience too. Don't forget to try this place if you are nearb

The food here is good, although please specify how spicy you want it so it meets your expectation. The best time to eat here is probably at night as it is cooler as there is no air conditioning in here. The speciality is the tissue prata which was tasty so be sure to try that. The service overall was good.

Visited this restaurant 2 times in one week.Greeted very warmly by the owner who took time to sit with us being tourist and apart from his good food and warm company,he passed so many valuable tourist information to us.We enjoyed very much the tissue Prata and crab curry. Never eaten this anywhere else in the world. Restaurant very clean and always full with tourists. Open 23 hours. At night tables are all full. Vibrant Environment.

Our office is around the corner and have been coming here regularly for a number of years. Coupon parking in MacPherson lane is often a good bet at lunch time just a few minutes walk.Good atmosphere in the place, friendly service and most importantly Super delicious Indian food.I often have mutton biryani or mutton masala with Prata and a boiled egg, a cup of teh tarik something like that. There is seating indoors and seating along the MacPherson sidewalk, but if you go early enough you can often get seating in the alley besides the restaurant which is shady and quieter.Have never been there other than weekday lunch times. Would definitely recommend if your office is in this area

Standards of service have dropped since my earlier review. Prices have gone up and food quality slid drastically.A glass of honey lime drink - iced.. cost $2. Worst, it comes full of calamansi lime pits... swimming in the glass. A hard boiled egg set you back $1.In regards to service, the food comes at room temperature. The bill doesn't come unless you hound after it. And when you approach the 'cashier' counter - it is mostly unmanned or with the staff there glued to his hand held device.. and you have to wait wait wait.And there are flies to accompany you at dinner - be it dining inside the coffeeshop or outside the back alley. It flags hygiene concerns.2 plates of roti prata, 1 plate of chicken dish, 2 teas = $10.40 Not good. (see photo)I waxed lyrical over this eatery in my previous review. This is the update - sad

One of the few places where u can sip teh tarik, have a good prata w excellent curry to complement and watch the world pass by .. I enjoy seats by the small lane at the side of the restaurant street - the kampong feel to it. Their briyani is also fragrant.

This outlet is best described as a 'coffeeshop' operation that features a wide range of ready-to-eat Indian Halal food on a bain-marie set up.Flanking this varied display is the murtabak/roti prata section with its imposing frying pan. And then, there is a showcase boasting items that comprises Indian Rojak staples.... crispy prawn fritters, dough balls, cuttlefish slices, sausage fingers etc.. and their trademark sauce.There is a display warmer that holds rectangular Indian curry puffs - yellow and flaky. Plus a chest freezer displaying a tempting array of ice cream products.The eatery is not airconditioned and there is outdoor al fresco seating at the side alley next to the outlet. Thankfully, this lane does not have rubbish chutes from neighbouring buildings... so it is rather cool to dine there. Certain tables are in smoking' zones for those who have the urge to light up.2 of us. We ordered 2 plates of steamed white rice, one serving of curry fish chunk, one serving of fried chicken drumstick (chopped), one cabbage dish, a side plate of sliced green chilli and sliced onion... which we dribbled a sweet black sauce on. For drinks, we downed 1 glass of iced bandung drink, 1 glass of 'teh o" Additionally, there was a plate of fish curry gravy... which was promptly refilled.The entire meal cost a total of S$13.30 Fantastic!The curry fish chunk was swimming in a hearty, thick, very subtly spiced gravy. Wow.The piping hot chicken drumstick was faultless. The cabbage, garnished with julienned carrot and whole dried red chillies did not disappoint. The sweet black sauce with the sliced green chilli and onions was irresistible., The gastronomic team here can certainly whip up wonders that are priced to be enjoyed.Burp...
