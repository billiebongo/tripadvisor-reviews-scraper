They have various outlets now, so you don't have to go down to old airport road for it! Order the original Beancurd and drink! It's 1.50 sgd each cup and bowl!

Tried this place for the first time during a visit to Maxwell market this week for a hawker lunch. Really quite tasty and only $1.50 a bowl. Definitely worth another visit.

The famous dish from old airport road, Lao Ban Soya Beancurd, its smooth, sweet, and cold, with a tasty layer of skin on top, I went to Bugis to get the almond flavoured, and its highly recommended.

My favourite dessert! Not a sweet person by default but I just love this. It's more exp than other taufa places but it tastes better (sweeter and so shiok!) in my opinion so I am willing to pay since it's not much more anyway and it's still cheap

This beancurd stall now has branches across the island for takeaways. I used to come here often, never missing a chance to have one bowl. Initially, the craze for it was nuts, people from all parts of the island would flock here, form a long 20mins queue just to buy their famous original beancurd. Some order 20 containers, most individuals leave with 5-6 containers, 1 long plastic bag full. Must Try! The original beancurd taste the best. It's ready packed, served chilled. Texture looks like konnyaku jelly but when you slip a spoonful into your mouth, it practically starts melting. They have since some up with new drinks like soya tea and soya coffee. Great soya novelty!

If you are not a fan of soya products, try this esp if you are here in Singapore.I promised you that this will change your life.The best soy-bean curd I have ever tasted, only go for the [ Lao Ban ] bean curd.They have the original, almond flavor and drink-type. They're all good but I would still go for their original beancurd. It's simply the best

We firstly passed it while we were on the way to have lunch, but then we decided to be back to have dessert here, and we did not disappoint. The beancurd was soft, silky, delicious and quite cheap. I tried the almond flavour while my wife chose to taste the original one, and we all loved it

Everytime I visit Singapore, I will never fail to pay my favorite soya beancurd stall a visit at Old Airport Rd hawker centre.This is by far the best soya beancurd I have had and the cold refreshing taste is a welcome any day.They have 2 flavors, original and almond. My preference is the original because it tastes natural.It's pretty easy to get to by public transport as well, just take the MRT and alight at Dakota station, it's a 5 min walk away.A must try, and why not take away a few boxes while you're there

My friend told me that I have to try this because it's really good.I'm going to Maxwell FC and found in it the front with an old man who sells bean curd, it cost $1.50/cup (It's big enough for me), without any syrup and sugar, it taste Superb. They sell Almond beancurd too and cost $2 (I'm not try it due to full with the original one).My other friend said it taste better than Cloud (Soy beancurd which sold in Jakarta).At least you have to try this for once in your life :
