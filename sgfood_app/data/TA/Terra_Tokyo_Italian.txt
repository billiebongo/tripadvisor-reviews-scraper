Awesome food with excellent service and the Chef is creative and professional.
Highly recommended to try.

Excellent food! Very interesting combination of flavours. The Chef really put his heart into creating the dishes. However, as the restaurant was full, it was not as quiet as expected, but still ok. Will definitely return!

Terra is described as Tokyo-Italian in style. I like both Japanese and Italian food (especially Italian) and so was keen to try this place out. We went for the mid-price six course tasting menu with half portion wine pairings as was a school night. The bread to start was lovely. Most of the ingredients are obviously carefully sourced in Japan, from the seafood to the tomatoes and herbs. They taste fresh, top notch and are all delicious. Four of the six courses are different seafood, and could be best described as a showcase of the Japanese sea. All four courses are light on the palate in an outdoors sea air tingly kind of way, and all delicious. The wagyu beef is also memorably succulent and excellent. The wine pairings are well thought out and complement the food well. I would suggest both the quality of the ingredients and the level of cooking skill put Terra in the running to regain its star.I have a couple of small reservations though. Although abalone is a hero of the Asian food scene, I can't avoid thinking it is still rather rubbery and tasteless, and would rather have eaten something else in a six course menu. I don't think there is enough Italian in the Tokyo-Italian for me. Except for pasta with the scampi, this was a showcase of Japanese seafood. Maybe another course with Italian inspired risotto, game or cheese wouldn't go amiss? And you can't see much of the small kitchen from the low seats at the kitchen counter and is not really worth bothering. But overall Terra gave us a memorable and excellent meal

We recently had an excellent and long overdue diner at Terra. Terra is an intriguing "Italian-Japanese" concept, and I must say it delivers the promises.The dishes are indeed Italians cooked with Japanese ingredients and manner.I am always a bit put off by the "omakaze" concept , but in this case it was made very easy. There are 3 menus at various prices, each has 6 courses, hopefully with different ingredients. The menu you get is quite respectful of your dietary restriction; and probably you can get it tailored to what you like.During our menu we had 6 very nice courses, the highlight was the uni spaghetti which we were told is the signature dish, but the carpacio and the fish in broth were also outstanding. Now a few generalities, the Japanese maitre d'hotel is very professional and extremely courteous, the decor is nice, relax and comfortable, maybe a bit more too relax for the quality of the food (and the bill). The wine list is very nice, I find many names I know, but I must say prices are a bit higher that the competition.A small conclusion? This was a very good, pleasing diner, but not really outstanding. The price tag is a bit too high which is a bit common to similar restaurants these days, but don't worry I'll surely go back
5
Really enjoyed the meal here consisting of Italian food with heavy Japanese influences. The ingredients are top grade Japanese and while simple in taste are a treat to eat. Will certainly be back to sample new dishes on the menu. Especially liked the pasta dishes, the chef has clearly spent ample time studying Italian and Japanese food preparation techniques
4
I have been to Terra Tokyo Italian on quite a few occasions and every meal was thoroughly enjoyable. Japanese and Italian food are both among my favourites. And when Chef Seita was able to marry the two cuisines successfully , i knew right away i have found one of my favourite restaurants in Singapore
4
Our long time Italian friend suggested this restaurant. As usual as an Italian he loves Italian cuisine & he knows which Italian restaurant to dine. Since then we came back here often. Chef Seita is a Japanese chef trained in Italy. He always chooses the best ingredient from Japan & cooks it in Italian ways. You can either ask for a la carte or Omakase.
5
First of all, this is a small but cosy Michelin Star restaurant located at Tras Street which is a short walking distance to-fro China town.It is also a fusion restaurant for Japan-Italian cuisine. They used to have 3 prices for the menu but recently the restaurant added a premium menu so now total 4 menus in a kind of omakase type of serving, i.e. the restaurant will serve whatever they have for that day.In general, it is a 6-course meal and every course is a small portion. I am not a big eater so this is good enough for me. However, for those who prefer to have more quantity so can request more bread as well as to upsize the spaghetti which is their signature dish.Overall, my experience with this restaurant is 5-stars esp the service from Mr. Sho - the restaurant manager is excellent.It is a bit pricey but worth to go for super meal in a Michelin star restaurant.Hope you like my review
5
Japanese obsession with detail and product quality combined with Italian flavour. I think only a Japanese can get this right. It’s simply something one needs to try. I’ve been twice because I really wanted to go back the next day. I didn’t order anything off the menu and simply went with whatever the Chef felt like serving - best decision ever. Two completely different menus. The food is outstanding without being pretentious. The menu had an impeccable quality and balance and was full of variety and pleasant surprises. The service is super friendly and attentive. This place is an absolute highlight in Singapore. Don’t go for ratings - which as many of you know have to be taken with a pinch (heap?) of salt in Asia anyway - just go to enjoy.
4
Terra is definitely consistent with it's fantastic uni pasta and wagyu beef. Flavours are clean and precise with a philosophy of focusing on ingredients.Although space is an issue when it comes down to atmosphere, cozy but can be a little bit cramped with service staff running around and close to other tables
4
My wife and I celebrated our 1st year wedding anniversary dinner at this restaurant. We went for 5-course set meal and were impressed by the food and service. The chef, the manager and staff are friendly. Will patronize the next time!
5
Went for dinner and celebrated my mom's birthday. We really enjoyed all the food which tasted so fresh and delicious. The service was really good too and they did a great job to make my mom's birthday a wonderful one. Thank you!
4
Had the middle Omakase set. New dish I did not have before was the scampi with homemade pasta and tomatoes. Scampi was very sweet and good
4
We were told that the difference in the three choices of Omakase was in the quality. We went for the cheapest option.
5
Simply an excellent experience. I will definitely go back. Very accommodating to special diets and no fuss in adjusting.
5
Simple flavours executed elegantly and beautifully. It was a lovely experience and I would definitely visit this restaurant again.
5
Ingredients of the highest quality and origin, cooking perfection, original recipes, extraordinary variety of dishes. Totally Italian, with the unmistakable influence of the Japanese quest for excellence. The strenuous efforts to source the purest and most natural ingredients from Japan, Italy and elsewhere are breathtaking (those pans have never seen a farmed fish; the Chef uses Tasmanian mustard for some sauces, whose taste is more "subtle" than Dijon's...).So is the mastery in achieving optimal cooking time by the second. This place is quasi-faultless. Not to mention the adorable maÃ®tre d'/sommelier and waiters, and the Chef himself, whose smiley welcome makes you happy to be there from the start, only prolonged by impeccable service
4
I have been to Terra for business and leisure lunches on about 6 occasions and it has always been a delightful dining experience. The Uni pasta has always been my favorite dish by their Japanese chef/owner and their Omakase menu offers very good value if you like seafood and wagyu beef. They had a change in their service staff recently and I hope that the new team will be as good as before
4
This was a birthday meal and I chose the $128++ omakase. Loves:1) interesting fusion of flavours (uni and spaghetti)2) professional and welcoming serviceI might not choose the counter seats again as it was a little cramped. All in all, a wonderful first experience
2
We had a quite an exquisite experience but they sold much higher expectations. Food was good as the ingredients used were high quality. Dessert was disappointing and staff service was mediocre and sub par for such a place other than one elderly waiter. Also, the restaurant served nespresso. Ugh.
4
I had lunch course with my girl friend, It was really good, I love wakyu steak. I wish to visit again.
5
Service was very prompt, maître d' explain each dishes with professionalism. 5 courses omakase, all dishes was well executed with rich flavors! The night end with a surprise dessert. Definitely will visit again!!
5
Heard a lot of good things about Terra. Our first visit, to celebrate my husband's birthday. Love the dinning experience; just seat & relax, let the chef & his team do their magic. Fresh ingredients with creativity. Best part is I could taste the heart and soul from the chef and his team. Terra is, definitely, up on my top 10 list of 'wow' restaurants in Singapore
5
Indeed lived up to expectations in terms of food quality and innovations. The fusion creations of Japanese and Italian by the Chef were great! Birthday surprise was executed very well too. Customer service was great, although more manpower could have catered to the lunch time crowd for quicker service
5
My wife and I arrived slightly early for our 8:30pm dinner booking and in short, we were not disappointed, the food was fresh and so well prepared.We had not read any reviews prior to our visit so as to not be influenced in any way possible.In addition, it was a first visit for both of us as well.On to the food, we chose the second option in the Omakase menu and was served the following:- Lightly toasted Brioche bread with truffle butter- Torched fish (Aburi style) - the fish is a Japanese name, unfortunately forgot the name- A cold corn soup with a bit of (handmade) burrata cheese- Tomato based Scampi prawn spaghetti - the prawn is large and was imported from the waiter's hometown in Japan (from memory, it was Nagayama?)- Iberico Pork, slightly pink but tender and served with finely cut spring onions- Dessert: Strawberry Tiramisu for me and Poached Fig for my wifeHaving read the other reviews, I am surprised to see criticism of the service - for us, it was very polite, professional and friendly.As for complaints about tomato based dishes - it is called Japanese-Italian fusion for a reason.Having tried other Michelin establishments, we can see why this place earned it's stripes.Despite the "priceyness", we would be happy to go back to see their other offerings (perhaps even lunch!).To top it off, Chef Seita Nakamura kindly said goodbye to us as we left Terra, always a nice touch when the chef has time to see us off
5
Went for my birthday dinner with family, great food with freshest ingredients, I like the element of surprise because you just tell waiter what you cannot eat, choose the price of the set and wait for the food to come.Seafood very fresh, some from Japan and pasta very well done, great fusion stuff, will definitely return. Somewhat pricey
5
Terra has a very warm and easy going atmosphere, unlike other upscale Michelin rated restaurant. But the service has top the scale! I had a wonderful dining experience there with my husband. I could absolutely enjoy the taste of my food without any fancy tricks which a lot of fancy restaurants do these days. Food is simple but fill with texture. Price is also surprisingly friendly.
4
I celebrated my wife's birthday here and everything was great for us. The restaurant's staff were friendly and explained each dish to us. Food was of course good. The birthday dessert along with a musical box playing the birthday song was a nice touch as well. All in all, we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves
5
We opted for the 4 course executive lunch. First course Hokkaido scallops with 5 varieties of mushroom and asparagus. Absolutely delicious, scalloped cooked to perfection. Second course - Pipi/Clam Spaghetti incredibly simple but yum.. although fiddly. Third course was wagyu with ratatouille style veggies - Medium rare melt in the mouth. Last course - strawberry tiramisu.All in all, delicious meal. Serving sizes are small but expected, I could easy eat another serving of the lunch. I would return again in a heartbeat coming for dinner next time.

My husband and I dined here with the middle of the three omakase options. We were among the first served for the night, and it seemed that the service was not ready for customers. We had to ask for the wine list, and 2 mins after that arrived, our first dish arrived while we were still browsing for wines. I'm eating a $168/head dinner, and I'd like to have a drink served prior to the food! We then had to wait 5+ minutes for them to realize we weren't eating yet and ask to order our wine. Wine service continued to be poor throughout the night. Our glasses were often left empty for long stretches, so much so that I almost went to fetch our bottle. $180 a bottle -- it should be served regularly. There was also a pacing issue with some long breaks between courses (again with an empty glass, too). Our water was never refilled without asking. At $600 for two, we shouldn't have to ask for water or wine to be topped up. Lastly, while most of the food was extremely good, we often did not know what it was. The servers/kitchen staff who brought the food out really need to work on speaking up and clearly so they can tell the dinners about the food. I was also a bit bummed about the difference in price levels of the omakase as we were never told what our ingredients would be. I see in some of the reviews that they bring out the ingredients for you to see, and I saw a tray go out once or twice last night but never to us. The bottarga and uni pasta was as good as I had hoped it would be; our prawn first dish was great; but what level did we need to order to get the signature uni appetizer dish that the folks next to us did receive? All in all, it seems the concept needs refining and the whole service needs a major improvement (we thought maybe they were done 1-2 staff). I've never had such poor service at a Michelin starred restaurant. Fortunately for Terra, the food is pretty great. Dessert was actually the stand out
4
Nice food, nice atmosphere , But cost performance
I went there with my wife. Lunch time is occupied about 80%
4
Simple menu but good food. Excellent taste and juicy meat. Very attentive service and nice experience
5
Family was very happy, particularly the ladies. Plenty of food. Plenty of taste. We got the SGD 128 per person Omikase, and it was 2 appetizers, 2 pastas, 1 main, and dessert. Michelin worthy!
4
Great 1 star Michelin experience. Ordered the 128 omakase set but the service staff missed out checking if we wish to order wine to go with the food. Having tried michelin restaurant around Europe, the food here was good but lack surprise.
4
Nice setting restaurant. Ingredients are very fresh. dishes are prepared with lots care, and are delicious.
Can recommend
3
We went there for dinner and took the middle price 5 courses menu (you can choose between 3 prices for the 5 courses menu and depending on your choice, the chef will cook with different ingredients).The Starters dishes were good but not exceptional. The 2 Pasta dishes were absolutely splendid and delicious. Some of the very best pasta I ever had (including fine dining restaurant in Italy).Main dish was very good.Desert was average.Overall, I would give 3.5/5 as pasta were splendid but it was closer to 3.5 as starters and desert were pretty unmemorable.Finally, I believe the price is definitely too high for such a restaurant (even considering the 1 star)
3
Food was ok. service not bad, but water wasn't topped up. Felt pressured by the server to opt for the pricier menus too. Focaccia bread tasted better than the starter, which says a lot. Other than that, pasta and main were delicious. Dessert so-so. Nothing special here, certainly not 1 Michelin Star quality. Perhaps the pricier omakase tastes much more superior with better ingredients but really there's no excuse for a Michelin starred restaurant. Portions are quite small, pricey for what you get.
3
We heard so much about this restaurant and we very happy to try it out on our special celebration. We were disappointed! I had 3 tomato based courses and all tasted the same. However, the service was very good but for that price, will I go back again? I certainly don't think so
5
Lovely not over the top dining. Service was excellent and food was very different to any other restaurant. All dishes were very appealing. The only complaint i would have is that there was two dishes that were tomato based. Besides that...i have nothing to complain abt. Will be back to try the $308 omakase
5
The food was excellent - simple yet full of flavor and made to the highest quality. It was a little confusing to know which level of meal to purchase for the group - $128, $168, $208 or $308 as you get the same number of courses and do not get to select your specific meals. However, I would recommend it and really enjoyed this meal for a great occasion. It was lovely to meet the chef afterwards - he is a very friendly man
5
We had the $128 Omakase set and the highlight of the meal was the Kagoshima beef that was done to perfection. The beef was so soft that the knife sitting on it could cut it.
5
Fantastic food, impeccable service from manager Aoki-san and the service staff. Street side parking is ample; if not just park at the nearby hotels.
5
Had the set lunch which seems to be choice of most diners when I visited. Every dish was superbly & tastefully done. A little small space wise. Could listen in on neighboring table conversations.
4
Had the normal Omakase. New item was an anago tempura...anago is currently in season. Very well cooked, batter was not oily
4
Had the 4 course set lunch here. Opted for the lobster pasta and also made a request for fish - if possible for the main course, which they acquiesced to.Food is excellent with the freshest ingredients. Service is impeccable. Would definitely go back for the dinner omakase sets.Only reason why it is 4 out of 5 is that the waiters could speak slower and louder when they explain the dishes. Could hardly understand them
3
We had the 5 course menu. Some amazing treats but some had potential for improvement.I would recommend the waiter to spent a little more time to introduce each course as they are rather special.I think consensus was great but not worth the price paid.More Italian than Japanese
4
Well you get what you expect for such category of restaurant.Service is very good though compared to what you usually find in Singapore.But for the price I would have expected a bigger "wow effect" .We have not tried the full discovery menu though as it requires a week notice.Maybe it just misses the "magic" even if technique is mastered. May come with experience
5
Dinner for two was excellent. We had the middle of the three menus. The food was great and they didn't seem on the usual michelin star mission to fill us to bursting and take the edge off a great evening. It was elegant, creative and the service was excellent. Get a table in the forward part of the restaurant (nearer to the door than the kitchen) as the atmosphere is lacking at the kitchen end. A thoroughly enjoyable - if reassuringly expensive - evening!
3
Went there for their 3 course set lunch. Bread was amazing with their home made truffle butter. Appetizer was also well made. However their recommended uni pasta was a disappointment. Probably I was expecting bigger chunk and stronger taste of Uni on the top of the pasta. Good thing about the pasta is at least it is al Dante and Texture is just nice. Another disappointment was the tiramisu dessert. Taste was really so normal. Perhaps I should try the omakase to better enjoy the dining experience
5
What an amazing place to eat. Three menus to choose from, each 5 courses. All fresh ingredients. Top menu, ingredients from Japan, so worth the taste bud experience. Flavours amazing, presentation excellent. Restaurant small which allows the waiters to provide excellent service. Wine list is very good. I couldn't fault this restaurant in any way. Would definitely go back.
2
Staff were very attentive but the food was disappointing especially the pasta. Pork ragu was really gamy. I couldn't have more than 2 bites of it. Appetizer was just average. Nothing to go back for.
4
The experience did not live up to the hype. Took a long time to get a Saturday night reservation. Food well prepared and presented. Ambience a let down.
4
Had my birthday lunch at Terra. Lovely service that was very attentive. Good quality of produce & well executed. Thanks to Chef Seita.
4
Enjoyed the set lunch (starter, pasta, main and dessert) for 58++.
Pork chop was nicely done, but dun expect big portions though.
4
Entire dinner experience was excellent to say the least.
Will consider returning for its better valued lunch.
However I suspect if it is a full seating, I wouldn't have been able to hold a decent conversation with my partner.
4
The overall food was very well balanced and the taste was nuanced and well controlled. Though for those looking for robust flavors, this may not be your first choice. I felt the pacing of the service was a bit off. The wait between dishes was a little too long. The overall experience was pretty good though.
4
Had an enjoyable meal with quality ingredients. Omakase Italian is interesting, if a little scary for someone who is not very adventurous with food. It turned out wonderful though. The reason for lack of 4 star was the requirement to impose al of my dietary restrictions on my dining partner as they required both orders to be exactly the same, ensuring that I won't be returning anytime soon with someone I am not familiar with or who has wildly different dining habits from myself
1
Just finished our dinner, for $208 each, we got a Uni starter, some truffles dish, half a Lobstor pasta dish in tomato sauce, clams in wine sauce, 1 slice of Wagyu beef and 1 dessert. Nothing impressive... we would expect a little more for a 1 Michelin star restaurant... other then the ingredients are fresh... we do not see any value or impressive about this meal... disappointed... we keep wondering what is the reason they get their 1 star when all these are easily achievable...
3
My first visit was fantastic and chef was there. Thus I brought my free friend but it was a disappointment.Saw the other table had wagyu and we only had fish which is mediocre. Initially they told us to give us pork but maybe due to someScrew up gave us fish instead. Ingredients weren't as good as last time either and bread was slow
3
The omakase centres around typical Italian offerings with a Japanese touch. The premium pricing is not justifiable. Service was good. Ambience nothing to shout about.Struggle to recommend as the pricing is too exorbitant for pretty standard fare.Pasta is pasta. The sauces and lobster do not make it 5-10 times more expensive.Wagyu - pretty ordinary. Any decent chef can handle a nice piece of quality meat
5
Terra has indeed met the Michelin expectations in terms of food. The freshest ingredients were being used in its simplicity which tasted delicious!
5
The location is extremely convenient, with wonderful hospitality by all the staffs, and had a fantastic omakase by the chef! Took up wine pairing and it was flawless. Will definitely visit again!
5
Service is very good
Food taste good
Nice setting
I opt for no seafood and they gave me very nice beef instead.
Excellent
5
wonderful dinner date with my wife. food was fantastic and the seafood was so fresh. However, restaurant was quite crowded and with everyone talking, it can be quite noisy at times. Otherwise it was a wonder experience
3
I went into Terra with high hopes, having heard several positive reviews as well as given their star. Unfortunately, these high hopes quickly proved misplaced. Went for the $208 menu; their most expensive. For this (as well as the two cheaper menus - the difference, they explained, is only in the type/quality of ingredients), you get six courses - no snacks. These six courses were generally uninspired and boring, as well as very sloppily plated - fine if this were a run of the mill restaurant, but certainly not the creativity and precision one expects of a starred restaurant, and for the price they charge.For instance, the pasta in my king crab pasta came with multiple strands out of place - an attempt for a different take on the standard central twirl of pasta? I think not, given the sloppy dripped on sauce for the next course of amedai - tasty, but very unappealing with poorly pureed uneven lumps of tomato from which the liquid had separated, and slap-dash poured onto the plate.As far as the food itself went - king crab pasta in a tomato-based sauce - yawn. beef with shaved truffles and some sort of demi-glace type sauce, with a bit of charred cabbage on the side - yawn again.Again, the food was not outright *bad* - and if you came without any expectations and paid a bit less, it might have made for a very decent dinner. But given that wasn't the case - this was unfortunately very disappointing
4
It's our usual practice to try out eateries new to us during lunch. Terra was recently awarded 1 star Michelin and so the expectations was high. We ordered the 4 course set lunch. The ingredients were fresh and cooking was good. There were no surprises neither was there anything that wow us. Will perhaps come back to try the chef omekase menu.
4
Ok, there is a system limitation here in that I am only permitted to select "average" or "very good". The truth is that this place is certainly better than average, but is it really very good...? I think "good" would suffice. The food is certainly good, but at these prices some would expect very good... the Iwate Beef was delicious, but I would say that the rest was only good.They have to work a little harder I think, since there are a bevy of similar restaurants operating in this space in Singapore.
5
Excellent fresh food products used, good experience with different kind of ingredients from Japan. Staffs are friendly makes dining very comfortable. Timely arrival of food, no need to wait too long but don't feel rush either. Restaurant may be a bit crowded and can be quite noisy when full as you can hear next table conversation easily. But other than that, really enjoyed the dishes a lot and would love to visit again l for other price range of omakase!!!
2
Doesn't meet expectation of a Michelin rated restaurant.Firstly on service, didn't get much help on differences between the 128, 168 or 208 menu except ingredients differ (what or how wasn't explained). Service staff recommended starting from the 'TOP' and working down, logic of which fails me. We decided to try the 168 menu instead and was then informed the 5 course meal will come with 2 pasta dish - which can be 'heavy' but the wait staff will try to negotiate with the Chef for an exchange for a Fish dish. I consider Terra to be a fine dining restaurant and does not appreciate this pretence of 'doing you a favour'. I am sure patrons will be happy to pay for fish or whatever they fancy if options were clearly presented.Secondly, none of the five courses wowed and can only be considered average. We were given the option of truffle shavings for our mains (veal) for additional 40. My take on food is ingredients should complement each other and the Chef is best able to decide what goes well together. Does truffle go well with everything? I doubt so. When presenting (not serving) the veal, we were told it's amazing without elaborating how or why. It was average at best. The cheesecake was forgettable (felt more like sponge cake) and seem more as an afterthought than a sweet end to a meal.Lastly, I feel there's a misrepresentation between what was reviewed by 'SoShiok' and what we had for the 168 menu. Mr Wong's meal came with scallops for the fish dish (exchanging pasta for fish seems more like norm then exception) and Wagyu beef (which we were informed was only available for the 208 menu)Poor experience, non value for money in Singapore's competitive food scene
4
All four omakase dinners have five dishes; the difference is in the quality of the ingredients. The food is quite good, using fresh ingredients and sophisticated techniques rather than being innovative; it truly deserves 1 Michelin star but you can also tell it's not yet 2 stars. The impeccably-dressed, handsome and well-mannered waiters are not terra-bly pro-active: we had to ask for wine and water refills throughout the dinner; a guest's cutlery piece fell and stayed on the floor for a good 10 minutes before somebody picked it up. Good wine list consisting of mainly Italian wines, with some French and sake thrown in. No corkage fee, but a 1-for-1 policy (you order a bottle of wine with a minimum value of $100 and they will serve one of your own for free). Portions tend to be small (maybe that's one of the meanings of the 'Tokyo' in the name?!), but you can order extra dishes a la carte if still hungry. French customers need not worry that the restaurant has any link with French tobacco company SEITA (producer of Gauloises and Gitanes); Seita here refers to Terra's owner, chef Seita Nakahara
5
Much is expected from a 1star restaurant. And i'd have to say they have continued to live up to the expectation and price. Overall, great service and great food.
4
We had the 128++ omakase set lunch which is a 5-course meal. Overall happy but was looking for more. Maybe weekdays aren't ideal to have a omakase course. The regular 2 or 3 course might be a better idea.
4
Set lunch. Started was burrata with ham and fig. Very fresh. Wagyu beef pasta for the main which was satisfying. Good tiramisu to finish
4
No menu but only ask for diet restrictions! It turned out a great surprise! The lunch set is a deal if you would like to taste the Michelin stars restaurants!
4
New omakase menu did not disappoint. Loved every single course! Just wish they would pick up the phone more. I tried changing my reservations and have been calling one week straight with no reply.
5
Omakase to celebrate birthdays in the family. Excellent seafood, very fresh and well cooked. Thumbs up :)
5
Been a few times to this restaurant. As the chef decides your menu - you never know what you will get - however one thing is certain: cosistent and amazing execution of the finest ingredients - never exagerated. Service is impeccable and genuine.
4
6 course Omakase left us feeling satisfied. Dishes well plated and food fresh and flavourful. Will visit again to try their Uni pasta which was not available the evening we dined there!
5
As the saying goes, quality does not come cheap and this certainly applies to this place. In a city known for really bad service, this is a refreshingly well run place with a very nice selection of food. It is exactly as the name states, a mix of Italian and Japanese, with the latter perhaps a reference to the portion size. No menus in this place, the chefs decides, Omakase style. I'd go back, although this place is definitely on the expensive side. The Michelin Star in this regard is not helpful
4
We went for the cheapest omakase at $128++ and came away satiated and impressed with the quality of the food. The wagyu ragu taglioni was delicious as was the iberico pork. Couldn't resist swallowing some of the fat that came with the meat. The restaurant was busy for a Wednesday evening and perhaps that was why someone forgot to introduce one of the fish dishes.
5
The service staff Win was truly a star at service. The place was full during lunch on a Friday so reservation is highly recommended.
4
Was overall a very satisfying Omakase experience. The choice of dishes was spot on as I was ill and we don't take beef and much seafood. The selections are of prime quality but the taste wasn't 5 star for me.
2
Really soso restaurant.
Average food with average service, nothing to be noticed except the bill which is pretty expensive for what you get. 5 courses including two pasta..
The Michelin star really doesn't impress..
5
Were there few days ago to celebrate friend birthday. We both are slightly difficult due to our dietary and allergy, the staff were very accommodative and friendly. Overall the restaurant is amazing, the food is great without feeling sinful :-)
4
Had the executive lunch but was not full. The scallop & pasta were delicious but the beef was a little tough to chew. The tirumissu was light & airy but too small a portion. Just a mouthful! Service is excellent.
4
The food quality is good but the portion is too small for the price that we pay. The service staff is attentive. The table is relatively small so it's not that comfortable. Also there is no table cloth so don't give the feel that it is an upmarket restaurant
5
I almost canceled our reservation after seeing the feedback from TA. Fortunately, knowing my wife loves Japanese Italian, I took the risk. My wife enjoyed the dinner. I also loved the food!They have 4 different Omakase set! We went with the lowest priced set as there are usually more food that make the experience worse.Food was excellent. The scallop and the Uni pasta was terra-fic! The scallop was huge yet very tender! We love Uni and this is why Japanese Italian pasta is spectacular!!! The seafood soup and grilled kurobuta was outstanding. Finally the pear ice cream was fresh and a great way to freshen the palate!Will be back soon
3
Honestly, food was superb. But the overall experience was mediocre. I called them a day before to arrange for a birthday surprise for my friend. Not much of a surprise, basically their dessert (bcoz its omakase) with happy birthday wordings. I have been to many other establishments which manage to do this without much difficulty. But they forgot completely. Served her dessert without any difference from mine. I didnt want to create a scene and since dessert was already served there's nothing much to do.Best part is they charge my credit card wrongly! Obviously they had under charge and had to do a offline charge. The thing is they didnt realise until closing and they called me at 11pm asking me for my card details. I had to tell them my card no. Including the security no. Etc. Not quite what i expect for a restaurant awarded with a star

Overpriced, average service, no creativity. Table of 3 including a pregnant woman. Despite telling the waiter the food restrictions (seafood for instance), the first 2 dishes served included lobster and scallop... the following 2 were just pasta (ragout and with sea urchin lacking taste). We ended up paying 750$ for 3 (1 bottle of wine) to eat pasta half of the dish. Ok it is Italian Japanese but eating average pasta in a starred restaurant is quite disappointing. Will surely not go back.

Sometimes fancy decor, Michelin star restaurants can be intimidating but this restaurant is far from it. The size of the restaurant was perfect and cozy. Value of Omakase lunch was very~~~reasonable and the food was indescribably tasty! This was my first visit and can't wait to go back for their dinner omakase
5
I really enjoyed the dishes here. The menu is dependent on what is available seasonally and we had snow crab. The flavours are subtle but amazing. Different from the usual meals I've had.
5
We had the omakase lunch menu and it was really enjoyable. the uni spaghetti is fantastic. all the dishes are well balanced and subtle.
4
Food were so nice but price too high. And I felt a Japanese staff's service wasn't good. I don't know I'll visit again or not.
5
Had a great meal at Terra for a birthday celebration. Ordered the Omakase set and was pleasantly surprised
5
One of our favorite restaurant in Singapore. The food is really incredible - uni, lobsters, truffle, wagyu. Everything course was cooked perfectly. Only negative point the vosne romané wasn t available....
3
Went with much expectation but ended with disappointment. Don't get me wrong. The food is above average but the 'wow' factor is not there.
4
Such an interesting concept you can't help but be curious.It was delicious and nice to have a menu served that meant you didn't need to make any choices for the evening except which wine to drink. I would go back as I'm interested to try the other ingredients and compare the difference between menus.
4
Personally, I felt this meal was a bit overpriced. The dishes were well-executived, but not very unique. Also, I felt like the chef reused many of the same ingredients (ex parsley) and flavors in multiple dishes. The restaurant is a bit oddly arranged. If you sit at the "sushi bar", you are too low to see into the kitchen. It is not very intimate -- feels more like a cafe
5
I appreciate the fact that this was a child free restaurant. The place was great. Staff who served us were friendly and funny. It was my boyfriend's birthday and they gave us a complimentary dessert. I was impressed with their excellent service and of course, the great food. Will definitely recommend my friends to give it a try. :
4
we had read a bit about terra online and were naturally quite keen to try them out during our recent visit to singapore. we used chope before and proved to be efficient, so we did so again and were promptly given the necessary assurance that the table had been booked. when we arrived the service was attentive and our menu choices adhered to with aplomb. food, needless to say was very good. although when it came to our pasta course, there was a slight miscommunication and we ended up with 2 of the same. we had intended for one of us to have the now infamous sea urchin pasta. the manager did not skip a beat and returned with a new plate in under 3 minutes. great recovery! we felt the menu was very well put together and the wines we had were exceptional. all in all a great experience and would return for the omakase
5
Fresh ingredients in all dishes served! Friendly and informative service staff. Will definitely visit again!
3
Server kept emphasising on the more I pay, the better ingredients I would get. Turns out sea urchin was stale and fishy.
5
Had wanted to try Terra even before the Michelin stars were announced, and am very glad I made it down to Terra. Rich flavours blending both Japanese and Italian ingredients and styles made every mouthful a delight and showcased the chef's Michelin star prowess. Will definitely return
4
Brought hubby to Terra to celebrate his birthday. Had informed that staff earlier that it was his birthday but no effort was put in to celebrate it in any way (i thought perhaps just decorate his dessert plate - not even asking for a complimentary dessert here - with the words happy birthday! would have been nice). Changed our mind about getting a bottle of wine and decided for individual glasses instead and this was met with disapproval. The waiter didn't even wait to know what we would like instead and made no effort to recommend any wines by the glass. Food was of excellent quality, japanese ingredients and beautifully presented. The assistant manager was effusive and happy to oblige when we asked for a particular dish not on the original Omakase menu. An expensive meal which was of good quality but service could be improve
5
One of the best meals I've had in my life. Simply put, everything was done spot on and the whole meal was very delicious. Had the four course lunch and the meal began with housemade bread and porcini mushroom butter, which was a great start. Starter was a chutoro sashimi and what a pleasant surprise as I did not expect to get chutoro for such a cheap lunch, such a great value. Next was the signature sea urchin pasta, which was highly addictive. Mains were wagyu beef which was hands down one of the best I've ever had. Everything on the plate was so good I had to resist licking the plate. Lunch ended with a fruit jelly which was light enough after 3 plates of decadent rich food. I love the brisk service and the friendliness of the servers. I will definitely be back and next time I would go for the omakase.
3
It was my second visit to Terra. I was very impressed with the restaurant when I first had dinner there. So I tried lunch on my second visit. I chose the $128 omakase set. It was lovely especially the first starter which had a delicious combination of seasonal produce such as figs, and melon with parma ham. However by the third course, I started to feel an upset in my tummy. It was bearable and I was able to finish lunch. On return to work, the tummy cramps were getting more pronounced and I eventually had vomiting and diarrhoeae. Hence the "Ã¤verage"rating given cos of the nasty end to my meal
3
Food was quite average but what was even more surprising was the service - we had to repeatedly remind the service staff on our requests, and our orders had to be repeated many times before the waiter could get it right - there were only 4 of us and we ordered the executive lunch - couldn't be that hard to get right? Personally my starter was good, but my pasta is definitely not great!
5
I saw this place on some list of best new spots in SGP. I love Italian and I love Japanese, so a 'fusion' spot of the two intrigued me. They use almost all Japanese ingredients, but with Italian recipes and cooking methods. I was a bit disappointed at first as their website stated they had a la carte, but when I sat down it was only Omakase. I almost walked out simply because I like to choose my dinners. They have three pricing tiers, if I remember correctly it was 109, 169 and 209 SGD. I opted for the middle one and it was simply awesome. The plates were incredible. My two favorite and dishes I would go back for specifically were the scallops done almost like a 'chicken parmesan' minus the chicken. The last course was an incredible beef dish. I loved this place and will be back for sure.
5
A weekday night dinner ar Terra Seita was very good. The service from start to finish was superb. Showing us the ingredients before the meal heightened the anticipation. The dishes included Uni crostini, lobster with an array of seasonal vegetables, pasta with porcini mushrooms and truffles ($80 supplement) and Wagyu beef. Overall good value even with the supplement for a generous serving of truffles
2
It started well but when we reached the third course the noise level generated by two couples seating at the other side of the restaurant, happily drinking and laughing loudly, was unbearable. Both the head waiter and the manager apologised when we left but did nothing to address the issue, eg by offering us a more quiet table or moving the noisy guests to a less exposed spot.We were three, each with a different food preference (1: eats all, 2: eats all except raw food, 3: vegetarian). Except for one course, we all got the same dishes. No effort by the chef to find a creative menu to please all preferences. Disappointing.Going to such a restaurant is about the "dining experience". The food quality was good, the atmosphere however was terrible and turned the evening into an unpleasant event. With one bottle of bubbly and one glass of wine in addition to the medium-priced omakase menu, we left $750 poorer. Not worth it and they will not see us back again
4
Good experience complete with nice ambience great food good service. Definitely worth a return visit.
4
Great menu that was well constructed. Top quality produce. The food was the star.
20 minutes wait was a pain but service was tidy. Red wine recommendation however was a shocker. Expect better from a top dinery.
But this fusion really works. Try.
5
We went for dinner on a weekend. Service was wonderfully personal from start to end, in a laid back setting which we found really comfortable. Food was marvellous as expected; particularly memorable was Scallop from Salfutu, which truly lived up to expectations.
3
We expected an indulgent but elegant evening. We got elegant but the food lacked flavour and we left unsatisfied. The venue is very pretty and the staff are very good, the food just needed a bit more love.
5
The Omakase lunch was excellent with carefully chosen ingredients from Japanese and European specialist producers. They tell you exactly where the food is from and if you enquiry they will explain why. The freshly made pasta dishes were especially good.
5
Nice Ambience with high quality food as well as attentive service staff with the best service! Thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and will be back to dine again.
5
The quality of the materials and the blending was good.. the lobster-abalone combination was a waste of 2 excellent pieces as they did not add more! The front staff was stretched for a full house but maintained a cheerful service. Place to return and watch to see how it will improve.
2
I agreed that the ingredients were super good, as there were flown from Japan every day, I heard that it's not so difficult for Singapore chefs to find the great Japanese seafood, beef and vegetables nowadays if you pay.I didn't see any creativity nor skill from each dish, it's very far from Michelin star standard if this restaurant was in Tokyo, Hong Kong, Italy anywhere else. It happens only in Singapore
3
Had the set lunch. Appetizer was a japanese melon with parma ham and burrata. Good combination of flavours, really good start of the meal. 2nd course, opted for the uni pasta for what seems to be one of their signatures, had to top up $10 though. A really good choice to go for the uni pasta, rich in flavour and umami and topped with delicious uni.The next part of the meal started going downhill which should be the climax and the most exciting part of the meal. Mains was beef sirloin with caponata and peppers. Very mild flavours, could use more seasoning. Beef lacked the beefy flavour, poor choice or type of beef used. Even an Australian angus has more flavour. Beef was slightly chewy, probably due to the choice of beef and it being cooked to medium. I prefer my steaks medium rare, no preference of doneness was asked. Dessert came to me as the weakest dish on the menu. Just a simple chocolate mousse topped with a few strawberries and blueberries. Feels that there is no thought and effort put into desserts. Overall, the dining experience went downhill after the 2nd course. Would have expected better from a restaurant getting 1 Michelin star even if it was a set lunch menu.
5
We had a great meal here with another couple - we chose the medium price menu - you can only get a set menu here, yet I was impressed that they were happy to cater for my friend's gluten free request. Each course was a delicacy - though burrata and tomatoes with a Japanese twist is stretching it slightly (the tomatoes were Japanese and delicious they were too!), but the spaghetti with sea urchin, and the two types of crispy fish, one with clams in a saffron sauce were scrumptious, and the wagyu beef was truly melt in the mouth. I dont have a sweet tooth but the puddings were also yummy! Excellent service from the maitre d, crispy and come,entry Italian wine. Not teh cheapest place to eat in Singapore, but well worth its Michelin star. Wish I d been here earlier...you must book well in advance, it's so popular
4
A small cozy place with friendly staff. My wife and I like the food. Uni with pasta, truffles with Onsen egg. Good wines by the glass too. Only thing was the 2 Korean girls next to our table, they were just too noisy.
5
This restaurant provide very great Tokyo-Italian fine dining...
Taste of food really good...the place is really nice and clean...
The scallop pasta and wagyu is highly recomended...
4
Great concept good food in the mix for a great meal - a good selection for food for every taste. The service is good. The portions are quite small so be prepared. Ensure you book as it is normally busy. Enjoy your meal.
5
Chef Seita is a genius mixing both italian and japanese influences together. Focusing on produce and great execution of techniques and building flavour, Chef has created an Omakase experience with Italian influences with his time spent abroad.
4
The highlights of the meal was actually the beef although their uni pasta is as good. I love uni but the dish didn't really bring out the taste of the ocean. It will be better if they substitute it with angel hair pasta.
2
As above. Uni pasta was good though and some interesting choices on the wine list. That being said not worth getting ill and paying 250 per head.
3
The food was good throughout, except for the dessert which was a huge disappointment (felt more like a palate cleanser rather than a real dessert - I thought something else was coming up but apparently I was wrong). The manager was nice, but the waiters and waitresses were subpar for a Michelin restaurant. The restaurant itself was also very noisy. Look somewhere else if you want to splurge since it was not exactly cheap for a 1 starred
3
I have dined there before they received their Star rating. It was good, and I wanted to celebrate a special occasion, so I chose this restaurant. The food was not as good as before. The Botan ebi was not as fresh, rather limp, the Uni pasta did not taste as nice, and I received "pork" as a main, instead of wagyu. One of my guests was not too pleased that the spanish pork was very pink. It could have been that her specific portion of the roast. If you are serving pork, it is best to ask how the guests would like it. The Chef might have been taking the night off (Monday nite), but the ingredients were not as fresh, and the flavouring was not there either. Fresh ingredients play a big part when the flavouring is not heavy. The restaurant was certainly more crowded than it was before, and the wait-staff was not that good (young gal), rather brusque. The charming Malay man was still around, his service is impeccable, however the additional staff need to be trained to be more personable and attentive (had to ask twice for more bread and water refills).
1
Visited the restaurant before they got the star and liked the food. Went there again on 2 Aug with a friend and manager recommended Omakase with best and fresh ingredients, but their "fresh" ingredients gave us food poisoning. Gave feedback to the restaurant and was very disappointed with how they handled the situation.
4
Food was very good and worth it - they have three types of omasake menu which no one shows the menu separately so we have to sorta guess. We chose the middle one and it was great - the egg had so much truffles; very impressive. uni noodles. melt in your mouth beef. The scallop carpaccio was delicious. Service was great. One major flaw though which would prevent us from going back any time soon - the food came so slow - in the end, we walked out without having dessert because it had taken 20 minutes!Â
4
Decided to try their omakase set which did not disappoint. Overall happy with the dishes especially beef
1
Expensive food! Go at your own peril and wallet and come back here to give us your honest view about the place. It sucks sucks sucks sucks!
5
like a Italian Japanese KAISEKI!
The all materials from Japan are very fresh and exellent.
The wines are also exellent and well selected,and really very suitable recomendation by sommelier.
1
There is only OMAKASE menu in 3 different prices. We simply wanted to know more tips to image their course menu in order to decide Wine and which price course we should take. Nevertheless, none of the staff to answer our questions what is the difference between these prices and what kind of the dish will be.... They're answered Depend on the chef! Yeah your right.. We just shut our mouth up, then eat right? Really disappointed and won't come again..
5
Shared a wonderful omakase menu dinner with my wife and a friend recently. We went for the mid-priced omakase at SGD$168 and also the wine pairings which was an extra $100. Food and wine were superb. Highlights included the prawn and caviar, uni (sea urchin) pasta and crab risotto. My wife thought the beef was the best she he had ever had! Service was friendly and attentive. An expensive night out for sure but we thought it was well worth it.

A Japanese Chef who was trained in Italy. Till here nothing special as a few similar "settings" -really so-so- experiences took place in Singapore: La Luna Rossa and Il Forlino If I remember well.However, it is different at Terra. The combination work. Pasta are al dente, truffles "smell" truffles -even in July- urshins are tasty and one with the other is succulent! Unfortunately couldn't try the desserts... ( be happy to share experience though). Nonetheless from starters to the 5th dish (!) was an exciting palate experience deliciously matched with a superb Tignanello 2010.Service was fun, cool and attentive. A place you don't want to miss.Cheers
4
Went there for lunch. They have an Omakase lunch and two set lunches. We had the three course set lunch which was excellent ($42). Ingredients were excellent and the burrata starter and pasta were delicious. Desert of chocolate mousse was also good. Rated it 4 rather than 5 as they got one order wrong. Otherwise service was excellent.
5
A business client introduced us to this new restaurant. A small outlet with excellent service and presentation of food was tastefully done. A good mix of fresh ingredients. The uni pasta was unique and not overbearing. Home made pasta was a pleasant change from other meals.
5
Given that this restaurant uses only the best Japanese ingredients, it is expensive. The three set dinner menus start at S$128 up to S$208, but worth every cent.The mix of Japanese fish and Wagyu with Italian herbs and pastas is dreamy. Hokkaido prawn sashimi with caviar was inspired as was the sea urchin pasta.The interior is well designed , the service superb and a good Italian wine list with decent and affordable wines available by the glass
4
Quality food with great service. However, I feel they should include tea or coffee at the end of the meal instead of charging us an extra $8 per cup of tea! The dinner is not cheap and I'm sure they could give the tea as complimentary
5
We have a big group and we were given 2 tables. Service was good and the food was delicious. We enjoyed the starter and main especially and will be back again.
5
Quite an interesting italian japanese restaurant. However, be prepared to eat only chef's special. There is no menu and you have to reserve in advance ! The place isn't that big as well.
5
Friday night managed to get a walk in at the bench overlooking the kitchen .. we liked it and a great experience watching the very diligent and professional staff and master chef in the kitchen.. gracious and organized . the food was really good , different, delicate, tasteful, hints of flavors and nothing over powering . We had the set menu and we asked for change in one course ( do not eat beef) not a problem.. thank you. every course was tasteful and well presented. The service was first class and streamlined and organized..not over powering and hanging round your table like some places, very professional and complemented the the chefs and the kitchen. yes the place us small but nice, yes the menu is different but exciting and well cooked and prepared and served. well done Terra it was a pleasure to be one of your customers and will return 
5
We have been here several times. Terra has unfailingly served consistently excellent food, good portions, with friendly knowledgeable service, cool thoughtful decor, at very fair prices. Oh and did I mention the excellent wines by the glass. You will enjoy your evening. The form is 'omakase', which means you are in the hands of the chef. Do not be anxious; everything is delicious and you are given super-fair substitutions if you do not want what is on offer. E.g. my dining partner does not eat sea urchin (in pasta); he was pleasantly surprised with half a delicious small lobster with his pasta instead! One is very well fed here, and all the ingredients are top-quality. Outstanding
4
the food was beautiful and the staff were very friendly as well. we got good advice on wine as well. I loved the sea urchin pasta, but I was told that the menu changes depends on the ingredients so the pasta is not on menu always. perfect for couple date dinner
3
Friends intro us to the restaurant and read about the review...so decided to give it a try.It turned out to be far away of my expectation, but no doubt of the freshness of the food. I personally find it is kind of "you know the chef restaurant"...We ordered the Omakase $168++Food: Fresh but not really value for money, disappointed with the dessert (Tiramisu) - the crÃ¨me was melted Service: GoodOverall: 2.5/
2
Terra came with high reviews and I was excited to try Chef Seita's culinary skills. Although it was good and within expectations, this was let down by the poor service staff. One that could not take my order properly and messed up the entire experience. My bread came last with my main course and when I opted for a $168 omakase meal, they gave me a $128 meal instead. I felt that that I was unable to experience the best of what could have been offered. Service recovery was done by offering Mr Yoshida's pork, but was a tad dry. My original main Kagoshima beef was of course, splendid. Hardly anything can go wrong with that kind of beef. This was not my first visit to a restaurant with omakase menu and I have had better
5
Tried the executive lunch set at Terra recently and it is fantastic value! The ingredients are fresh and very high quality, the food is excellent, the service personal and attentive and the price tag very reasonable. Highly recommended and I would like to return for more
5
Love the set up of the resturant as I find the space comfortable but I may not feel the same if I was placed on the high chairs I guess. Foood I love as a personal preference I took the dinner set which is abt 208++ per pax. ( Pricey but for the quality I feel is worth the money ) 5 course meal. Not too much I feel from the portion to the serving time was paced well. Very entertaining host I would have to say.Was there for a birthday celebration and I truly love the foood. The freshness of the ingredients to the presentation to the service.Maybe the little attention to details will be a thing they could do alittle better. (Small tiny bone found in my fish )But other then that I look forward to my future return to the resturant
5
I love to visit the restaurant with friends and family or business and now terra is the place for me to choose and also I can say "the best Italian in Singapore. " Owner Chef, Seita has an excellent technique, experience and he never ever made me disapointed every single visit since last year. I love his Omakase with 5 course incl Appetizer, Pasta, Fish, Meat and dessert. Especially his sea urchin pasta is my favorite item. I always ask more! Seita said, terra is Tokyo Italian, using 70 to 80% of Japanese ingredients and very fresh. Yoshioka Pork, Kagoshima Beef, Hokkaido Scallap, Homemade Bottarga etc. Manager is always paid attention to the guest and very detail. My Client was also happy when I brought them for dinner. I can't wait for coming back again to terra and Seita's Tokyo Italian
