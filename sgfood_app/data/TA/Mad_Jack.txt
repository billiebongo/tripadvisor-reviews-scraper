Simple cafe within a residential area. Menu is fairly extensive. Food taste ok for reasonable price. Nothing fancy, more like a family cafe/restaurant.

The broccoli salad is the best that I have had. It is a mix of broccoli, mango, strawberry slices, crabstick slices and nuts and raisins with yogurt topping all rested in a lettuce leaf. It is the most memorable dish and I believe it is their in-house creation. Complimentary slice cake is given if it happens to be your birthday which needs ID verification. Hope they keep it this way and make the customers happy. Will be back again

Pathetic quality of food... Serving portion is poor too... The only saving grace is the air conditioned environment...At this rate the establishment portrays itself as a cafe with great food, it is sure to wind up its business soon! Do not try their fish and chips... Really muddy/fishy odour!

Okay, this isn't a place to get dressed up for a night out. More like a lunchtime with the family. No table cloths, don't expect Gordon Ramsay in the kitchen.I enjoyed the food. 3 meals all didn't disappoint. I actually enjoyed the multi-burger, it came with slices of pineapple. Burger was moist and I was pleased.Chips are not fries, they are decent sized chips.Desserts are nice and on display.Service is by young kids earning money on a weekend. Not rocket scientist stuff here, just select the number you want from the list and write it on the piece of paper at the table. It's that simple.Would I go back: yesWould I have another burger: probably though there is a vast array of tempting selections from which to choose
