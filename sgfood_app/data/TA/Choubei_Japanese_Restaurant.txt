I have since 30 years once a week sushi. In several hundred places world wide.
For me, this place is one of the 10 best.

My son proclaimed that this is the best Japanese food he has ever had! I must agree, all of our meals were sensationally presented and extremely tasty. The serving staff were lovely and I highly recommend this restaurant if you are in the area

this place serves really good and authentic Japanese food. Love it. Itâ€™s quiet and this is a rare gem in the east of Singapore. the sashimi is fresh. Goes perfectly with their sake :) The grilled black pork meat is absolutely awesome! A must have! We also had the yummy gindara teriyaki. Thank you for the awesome lunch! They also gave us a complimentary fruit platter! Awesome!

Arrived at the restaurant on a weekday night at 8.30 pm. Three of us were the only dinners in the whole restaurant. I told myself, the food must be bad as there was no one there. Since we were the only customers, the staff were very pampering and courteous.The best dish must be the friend chicken in teriyaki sauce. The chicken was crispy out side and tender inside. The taste was excellent too. The Cod fish set was good value for money. The chawanmushi that came with it was very smooth and delicious. It easily satisfy a dinner as the portion is big enough. The beef rice was value for money. My guest enjoyed it. The Kuro Buta Somen is different kind of noodles. The broth was good and I enjoyed it. On the whole, the food was not bad at all. There was a 15% discount on all dishes that is not in the set menu.The business of this restaurant was not good when we were there. I am sure it will get more customers if it located not so far away from downtown. Our dinner took less that an hour and we were shocked that the parking at the hotel, where the restaurant was located, was $6.50. The is perhaps we were charged per entry parking fees after 6 pm but its just too expensive . This may be another reason why this restaurant has less business than it really deserves

One of the best thing about this restaurant is that its always not crowded. Not that its not good, the food is good! Probably due to the fact that it is facing stiff competition from cheap and tasty hawker fares opposite. However, if you are out to have a food japanese meal, you are in for a treat. My girfriend and myself visit this restaurant once a month, to indulge in a fullfilling and quiet meal. The service is good and the food is fresh and nicely prepared. Guaranteed a tasty meal for a decent price. Do give it a try when you feel like having a meal at the far end of Singapore, taking a stroll along the beach among the crowds of pokemon players after the delicious meal. Guaranteed to be worth your time and money

It's probably the first time I had japanese cuisine with the yellow flower being real. Left an impression because the restaurant was barely occupied on Sunday lunch hours, and I was wondering how do they survive. By the way, they have 1-for-1 deal for its Gozen (set lunches) on weekends, pretty decent deal

A great Japanese restaurant with simply delicious food. The ambience is that of a family having a meal together. If you love Japanese food and wants to eat anything from sashimi to simple home cooked Japanese food this is a must to visit.Chef Ong Kian Teck makes you at home and he makes the most delicious fried mee sua
