Buffet @ Marriott Cafe- Walking distant is 1.9km (5mins) from Orchard MRT- Restaurant located at Marriott Hotel Lobby - Visited on Monday night, it was not crowded given that it was a weekday - Staffs was friendly & helpful with the recommendation.- Buffett selection consist of seafood (Oysters, Prawns, Crabs, Crayfish), Sashimi (Salmon, Tuna) & a mixture of India, Chinese, Italian, Western. Quite a good choice of selection but the spread wasn’t that good.- Seafood itself is not the freshest compared to other places I have tried. - Sashimi cut was too thick - Mixture of the other cuisines dishes was not fantastic as well given the taste of it.  Overall: It was expensive given that the food was of an average quality. Staff services was good. Important Note:With an additional top up of $36 or $36plus, you can enjoyed the free flow of wine. Do ask the staffs about it.

Went there for dinner during my husband birthday. I love their salmon and tuna, very fresh, same with the oyster. Meat lovers will like this buffet because they serve quite number of meat. I like their carving station- lamb, steak, pork, duck etc. They also prepared a birthday cake for my Husband. Overall, its value for money.!Oh, I love their service as well. All their staff were pleasant. See you again.

I loved the seafood selections such as oysters , lobsters , king crab legs and shrimps but their desserts really need some improvement

It is a good dinner we had and the variety is reasonable. We will definitely revisit again another time

Went there on a Sunday with friends for lunch recently and was truly disappointed. It used to be my favourite buffet place in Orchard Road but standard has dropped drastically. Oyster used to be fresh and juicy but now has come thin and not fresh. 80% of the other food was terrible. Only the pastries were good. Always wanted to bring my whole family over but i'm glad i didn't. Most of my friends all agreed !! Marriott Cafe seriously need major improvement or else they will be losing more customers .

A lovely place to have a hearty breakfast. The spread is great with good service to match. Plates are cleared quickly and coffee is topped up regularly too

Went for a weekend lunch buffet. The seafood were fresh, desserts were good and sashimi lovers will love their sashimi. For the price, i think it's worth it. Just remember to make a reservation or else you will walk away disappointed.
5
Coffee n tea for the english high tea buffet was up to standard. Service was great despite of some miscommunication on our reservation by the staff...we were told initially that there were no seats for us. Staff still remember us as this was our 2nd anniversary ( we came last year 2016 as well). Simply love this place
5
Food and location excellent... The service of the staff superb. Thanks to Ms Vic ,Maria and Maro and Li

Food as compared to our last visit months ago, wasn't as good as before although there's wide spread of variety. Simple Laksa dish taste and looks awful. However what makes us really happy is the staff Mr Sujin who attended to us, he is very helpful and friendly! A very polite and sincere man~thanks again Sujin
5
Excellent place with great service. Staff is approachable and friendly. my kids love the food very much. it has so much variety to choose from. this is my third visit there. looking forward to next visit

Breakfast to Dinner the food is great...Thanks for the excellent service of the staff namely Ms Vic, Ms Liz and Ms Mari

Great! Enjoy the food and atmosphere. Will definitely visit again! Value for money too, with the great promotion!

Nice place to gather and eat together. The food are fresh and hot. But would prefer to have the place to be lighted up, as it seems too dimmed
4
Had our hi-tea buffet with my family on Sunday, 14 Jan at Marriott Cafe. We were served by Sujin and his colleagues who were very friendly and attentive to our needs. They made sure we good about the meal and the dining experience.Also commendable was David (I think he might be the duty manager as he was suit up). I recently sprained my ankle and was in a brace trying to prepare a plate of Rojak. David noticed it and offered to help me and even brought my earlier collected plate of food together with the Rojak to our table. Though I initially declined as I didn’t want to bother him (I thought he was on his way to attend to something else). But David still went out of his way to help me.Kudos to Sujin and David! Thanks for leaving us with a good dining experience! :

We enjoy our stay and the breakfast is awesome.We will keep coming back ..Thank you Mr Anthony,Liz,Maria,Liz Ajay and Allan for the excellent service.

Nice cosy environment with a good selection of international and asian delights! Great for families with kids and seniors

Booked a table for high-tea buffet and fortunately i turned up early prior to 3pm. The queue was so long and they only started to clear the line at 3pm sharp. The buffet consisted of prawns, oysters, local dishes like carrot cake, roti prata, char kuay teow, chicken rice, laksa, rojak, pastries. Unfortunately, no sashimi, only smoked salmon. Dessert consisted of some cakes, kuehs, ice cream, crepes, bread pudding and sticky date pudding. cakes were limited in variety. Go for the crepe, it's probably the best. Service was slightly slow, more than once had to call for tea top ups, perhaps it was too crowded. Overall, the selection and experience was rather average, only worth it if its on 1 for 1 promo but good to try once
5
Thanks Chef Raj. Will surely come back... Staff like Maro is very engaging. Great way to celebrate family time.
5
Had a great night of celebrating sister’s birthday! not only coz of the food but also thankful for the great service of Sujin and Maro! will surely come back to this cafe.. love the ouster and the crab leg! looking forward for lobster on our next visit!!!!
5
Excellent quality of food not to miss! Good spread of singapore delicacies to choose from... we would like to extend our warmest regards to Mr Anthony for the service provided.. along with his staff alwyn. Thank you very much!
5
Value for money.. Wide variety of food.. fresh oyster, crayfish.. Good Service especially Sujin and Maro..

Firstly, we went to the Cafe and they chased us out to wait at the lobby when it was so crowded and the Cafe not was crowded and there were tables that were ready.There were no customer service and staff could not see us. No warm welcome, no greetings, no smile. The food were not fresh sadly. Not hygenic also and we informed the staff and they did not bother
5
ihavebeen regular guest for afternoon buffet. I always love to bring my guest here especially foreigner to enjoy and try our aunthentic local dishes. Very friendly atmosphere . Definitely like a family to me. Thank you marriott. We will come back again and again. Special thanks to Ling and Maro for the assistance.
5
Amazing food choices, very friendly staff and always accommodating even gave us free travel advice!So much choice and great quality food, always ate far too much!!Great location also near the malls and shops of Orchard Road

I guessed Marriott Cafe buffet is not one where you can go back for repeated visit. This round was my second visit for buffet at Marriot Cafe. My first buffet was the Sunday lunch and this buffet was for dinner buffet. I feel that there is hardly any difference between the Sunday Lunch and dinner buffet in terms of variety.The Boston lobster quality has also worsen. This round, most of the lobster were of smaller size and the flesh was tougher. The meat was very chewy and quite tasteless. The airconditioning of the restaurant was quite stuffy, as we sat through dinner, it felt warmer and warmer. Maybe it is due to the sharing of space with the Crossroad cafe. I could also smell cigratte smoke from where I was seated due to the layout of Marriot Cafe and Crossroad cafe.So for $80++, I guess, I would rather go somewhere else to eat. Very disappointed especially when we went for a celebration
5
This is one of our favorite spots on Orchard for a drink or breakfast. Shida, the waitress here, remembers us year after year when we come back on trips, and always remembers our fresh pressed green apple and ginger juice. The place has managed to retain their staff over the past 6 years we've been living there, or now back visiting... they are doing something right to keep their talent and customers returning
5
Very easy to find,just around orchard area. Accessible to mrt & busses. Food was fantastic!!! My favorite was their fresh seafood and mouth watering desserts. Outstanding service of Anthony & Mogan. Reccommendable!!
5
All the staff are approachable..good services and their food are very good..having a great time in here...Thumbs up...:)

Great burgers - Great service from Himani could be the best burger in Singapore Also a great spot for people watching

Excellent food and service by the staff Maro and Ajay thank you very much for the wonderful service..we will coming bac

Food (4 stars) - Varieties is good. Seafood are fresh. Food is tasty! If you're a seafood lover, I guess it's already money worth! - Been to quite a few buffet, but Marriott Cafe is the only I came across that serve oyster and Prosciutto! Yummy!- Dessert section needs more improvement. Ambiance (4.5 stars) - Nice and cosy- Good for a long nice chat with friendsStaff (ranging from 1 star to 4.5 stars)- The moment we stepped in, we were agreed by someone who had a really bad day and took it upon the guest. I didn't really bother about her, as I just want to have a nice meal. But we overheard other tourist complain about her attitude and how she'll affect the image of a 5 stars hotel. - The waiter/waitress are good. The cashier extend her service of helping us while we were standing around waiting for the lady with bad day to confirm where our table wasStaff with 1 star! - Everything was good until we call for the bill. The same Lady having a bad day pass me the bill with Citibank promotion. I told her I didn't state over the phone reservation that I'll be using Citibank card as I need to check which credit card I have and I'll confirm only upon billing. Guess I just made her day worse. She took my credit card and say will check, and immediately mumble something to the cashier in a complaining sort of way! Right in front of customer's face! I didn't want to create a scene but is that the way a service staff should behave in a 5 stars hotel? Anyway, she didn't bother giving us the bill. After waiting for more than 15 mins, I asked the cashier, and my bill was sitting there (for don't know how long). What a way to end my meal
5
We had no expectation for the brunch of Christmas , often very expensive for classic food . ..And actually we were wrong. It started with a misunderstanding on the reservation perfectly managed by the head of management. Please go there for the best quality / price ratio buffet I have seen in Singapore for long . Enjoy the splendid seafood buffet with super fresh oysters , lobsters and crabs ...absolutely amazing, Chinese , Japanese , meat buffet , excellent wines and finally the desert buffet that equals in quality the ones you could find in excellent one or two star Michelin restaurants in France. Check the prices and the menus and compare ! You ll be surprised !

I have been to Marriott cafe couple of times. Food spread as usually is good. Prawns, salmon are really fresh. I love that the dessert spread are lovely displayed. Feel free to ask for coffee or even cafe lattes. It’s included in the buffet. We were focusing on chatting, didn’t keep track of time. So we did not managed to have our gift exchange there. Cuz the last 15mins we were rushing for our desserts!! Nevertheless, We had a lovely Xmas lunch
5
The service was really good and the prawns were fresh. The seafood is well made and it was really worth it. The place is also very easy to find
5
Great dining experience. Thanks to Ms. Maro and the rest of the staff for the excellent service. Looking forward for another visit

There was such a variety of food being prepared by the chefs at the various stations, that it was difficult to stop. My favorite part was the desserts, from mango custard to cheesecakes, and ice-cream with fresh fruit

My wife and I started searching for a Christmas Eve lunch buffet place from early November, as Christmas is not only our favourite time of the year, but this year's Christmas will also be my baby daughter's first ever. So we really wanted to pick somehwere special.Then we came across the Christmas Eve Lunch Buffet menu on Marriott Cafe's Festive Buffet page, and it's a very gorgeous menu that's different from the normal Festive Lunch Buffet menu on other days of December, with lots of special dishes that are not seen in the normal Festive Lunch Buffet menu. So we decided right away that we will book Marriott Cafe for this year's Christmas Eve Lunch Buffet. We then proceeded to make the booking before mid-November and have been looking forward to this family festive celebration with eager anticipation since then. I even saved a copy of that Christmas Eve Lunch Buffet menu on my desktop since we really loved it.A few days ago, a friend asked me to recommend a place for buffet, and I happened to check back Marriott Cafe's Festive Buffet page as I wanted to recommend it. However, I noticed that the Christmas Eve Lunch Buffet menu has been removed from the site and instead, the generic Festive Lunch Buffet menu for December will be served on 24th Dec. I was totally shocked!!I understand restaurants make amendments to their menus from time to time due to freshness and availability needs, but for this case, the change is too drastic as the entire menu is different. Shouldn't the restaurant at least make an effort to inform those diners who made reservations more than one month in advance based on the previously publicised menu of such a drastic change?I can't help but feel cheated as a customer. If I had not been so eager to support Marriott Cafe and make the booking way in advance, I could still spot the change in menu later on and book some other restaurants that do offer something special for Christmas Eve Lunch Buffet. Now that Christmas is just a few days away, it's simply impossible for me to get a booking at any other decent restaurants. I really wonder, is that a marketing trick that Marriott Cafe does every time?I'm not able to describe how disappointed we are right now. On top of that, I really blame myself for failing to give my family a special Christmas Eve lunch buffet that I have wanted so much to for so long. You guys really ruined our Christmas

Mainly local food which is average in quality. Can get better food at the hawker centre. The pizza is good. Ambience is good. The service is good
5
Staff service was immaculate. Variety of food was great. Food was sumptuous and portions were generous. Refills were quick. I had a very good experience.

This is the best buffet experience so far...the selections are numerous and all of it are delicious.

Marriot Café variety is good. Items are fresh especially the seafood. Nice place for family and friend

Good spread of food.. service is good... ambience nice too especially going with group of friends...

Good spread of food especially the seafood except some of the seafood is not so fresh. Overall good food but a little too pricey.
5
3rd time is the charm, Marriot Cafe.You never seem to disappoint! Consistently excellent food, phenomenal service (by She Hui again) and amazing ambience.The epitome of Singapore's hustle and bustle which is perfectly situated at the Heart of Orchard. The place is always packed, so you better reserve early! As Singaporean culture dictates, if there is a queue, it must be pretty damn good. And it is.Definitely one of favorite restaurants in SG. I never forget to visit when I travel to the country
5
Fresh seafood and good buffet for lunch. Great location. Part of the love dining amex platinum card.

Love the food at Marriott Cafe. This place is my daughter favourite to go place for lunch buffet. Service is good too

Went here for our Anniversary lunch. First time to dine here. Food is okay average but no wow factor that would make me want to come back again
5
Food selection and service were great. Very warm and friendly staff. Enjoyed myself having breakfast throughout my stay. Maria and Liz and Vic were very accommodating and friendly. He mani my server was very attentive to my needs. I recommend eating at the Marriott cafe
5
Aside from good foods we love the excellent service of the staff,kudos to Marina,Anthony and She Hui.

Thank you to the following who assists our needs...To Maria, Vic, Liza and Maro! Very warm accommodation from you all. Good job!

I had lunch buffet with my friend at Marriot Cafe on 23 Nov. 2017. I enjoyed the international variety of mouth watering food. But what made me happy as a customer is the excellent service by their staff. I would like to commend two of them first is Mr. Anthony De Lara who was always smiling to all the customers and he was so friendly. But most of all I would like to commend Ms. Vic Laurente for an outstanding customer service. The moment we enter their cafe we felt her sincere, friendly and warm hospitality. We felt at home at their cafe because of her passion in providing excellent customer service. Ms. Vic is an epitome of great role model in Customer Service. Because of this great experience, I will definitely come back to Marriot Cafe and I will highly recommend it to my family and friends.
5
We did enjoyed our buffet dinner.The food choices were overwhelming , I really liked their fresh salmon & tuna sashimi as well as sushi & maki. The food was fresh, properly prepared and a great value for the price. We highly recommend it. Last but not least, the staff especially Maro were so accomodating, her service goes beyond our expectations... well done Maro
5
Food is good. But the thing we liked is the service of the staffs. Very friendly and accomodating. Will definitely come back here. Highly recommended.
5
Excellent food and good customer service!We will surely comeback... we enjoy definitely the variety of foods serve...Thanks for the awesome service
4
Food was fairly decent. Had used the Club Marriot’s 50% voucher for a group of 5, so it was pretty much a dinner well-spent. I would, however, might not recommend if you were to pay full price for it. You can get better choices out there for the full-price equivalent. Service was good too.

Marriott Cafe is a nice place for having something to eat, but not a place where you "must go". If you stay at the hotel and you want a quick bite, it is o

The food were great (all fresh and many variation) and the staff were very friendly and accomodating especially Ms. Maro....great experience...will come back next tim

Thank you for accommodating my last minute booking! Good service and very nice food! Special thanks to the following who cater my request: Maria, Vic, Liz and Mark.

I have looked forward to the Marriott's cafe experience and today this became a most wonderful and memorable experience. The moment you arrive at the hotel entrance we were greeted and assisted with lovely smile Ms.MARO . We were promptly shown to our table and the service was second to none. Polite, professional and knowledgeable service tend to your every need, we didn't have to ask for anything as staff were preemptive and responsive to everything you could want. Honestly the food was varied and superb however much too much to eat for us!! I should also mention that we were serenaded by the most beautiful harpist who was mesmerising and played so perfectly the atmosphere was relaxed and peaceful. Food selection as awesome like hokkien mee ,laksa, stick pudding, smoke Salomon more and more  Marriott high tea is a 'Must Do' while you visit Singapore. We will definitely be back and want to say a huge thank you to MS.Maro making our Marriott experience

Very nice breakfast at Marriott Cafe and excellent service from the staff Ms Maro,Vic,Ajay,Ling.A lot of food selectio

I have visited Marriott Cafe over 5 times for every special occasion over the course of a year. I am happy to say that the standard of the food is very good, yet I am disappointed to say that every time I visit the place, the variety of food is the same and it rarely ever changes. As a Marriott member, it is rather discouraging to visit the same place with the same food over and over if the variety does not change much. Above all, food and service is very decent but as a regular patron of Marriott Cafe, I would love to see a change in the variety of food. Some examples would be seasonal changes in the courses like for Christmas etc. It is always a great joy to visit Marriott Cafe and I do hope that I would be able to see new food the next time I visit
3
Was there for the buffet dinner. Wide variety of food; food quality was decent. Service standard was about average. Probably fine for a casual dinner, but do not expect to be impressed or to impress others
4
Marriott High Tea is often fully booked, I have to booked 1 month in advance. The food is fresh and lots of variety such as noodle station, self mix rojak, sushi, indian food, freshly made crepe, seafood, salad, fruits, cakes, tarts, dessert, ice cream and more... the service was prompt in clearing the plates and repenlish of food.
3
Went for Hi tea or was it lunch buffet.Price wasn't too expensive. Variety average. Food quality average.But the staff we met gave excellent service; attentive. We had a baby, and she was asleep so the staff okay for us to change to sofa seats, and baby could lie down to sleep. He gave us a cushion for baby to rest her head on.but having said that, there is no good place or safe place to have the kid for resting. No space for stroller. even the sofa seat is alittle dangerous as thats the area they placed used cutlery and plates.Not worth to go for, sadly.
5
The food is amazing. Most of the food served are healthy and there are lots of food to choose from. The ambience is perfect and the service is wonderful. Meet this Filipino Guy named Mr Rolando , the hotel ambassador who welcomed us warmly. Thumbs up for him. ❤
3
We are small group of regulars for their lunch and dinner buffets. Enjoyed visiting the cafe because of its very central location and good quality food. However, the hotel has clearly not refreshed its buffet selection and layout for a few years. As far as we can remember, the menu and layout has been the same. It’s beginning to very outdated and boring. More fun to drop by the JW Marriott or Grand Hyatt (just next door) for a change.
5
One of our Best dining experience here in Singapore. Ambience is great, service staff are best, Food presentation and quality are awesome!I would like to highlight the Staff Great service, they are friendly and most of all they do have the proper knowledge of the food they are serving, they even invited us for a Seafood Galore Night.Great Job Marriot Cafe! Keep it up. More power!Definitely coming back with my group of friends for another Fun and best dining experience. Thank you for making our simple Wedding Anniversary Complete.
5
Good service and free flow of foods. Good ambiance too. The staffs are very accomodating. Very relaxing place. Good place to go. Kudos!
5
This restaurant is very popular judging from the number of diners. Food spread is very good and the lobster servings are generous. Staff are courteous and clearing of dishes from the tables are prompt. I had a wonderful and enjoyable time with my family and friends. Thank you
5
Fantastic buffet with salad bar, fresh breads, sushi, seafood bar, roasts (pork, beef, lamb) and many great cooked dishes. Free flowing wine is a great value for a small additional costs with great selection of reds and whites. Can’t wait to go back
5
Today I must thank Praveen for his attentiveness and professionalism....I felt very pampered !!! Thank you !!
3
It's a one-time experience for locals who know where to get better food served in this buffet line. Price is reasonable as there is 50% off regular price. It should be a good experience for non-asian tourists who would like to experience Asian cuisine
5
Nice food, great ambience, comfortable and spacious with nice music. Good for family gatherings. Very accommodating staff.
4
The food was great! The black pepper crab was too small for such a flavourful dish, perhaps a bigger one like the Sri Lankan Crab should be used next time :) Other than that, we were well taken care of by the staff Maro, Shi Hui and Tharindi
5
We love this restaurant for the great food and excellent service of the staff namely Anthony ,Vic,Liz,Maria,Anita and Rinn
4
The Marriott Cafe is amazing. For 70 SGD you get access to the buffet that is REALLY good! The location is super central
5
First time to visit for a buffet here and the ambiance very cozy and the staff were approachable. The food were superb and delicious. Maro, is very attentive and approachable. She makes our experience very enjoyable

Had a great unplanned weekday dinner buffet tonight. Love the sashimi, roast beef, amazing beef short ribs, sticky date pudding, hot fresh pastas, but did miss the lobster, hot crepes suzette (was told only weekends) amd jamon.. But chef made up for it in a super nice way. The friendly staff makes it extra special, kudos to Arun the chef and David the duty manager, made my evening much more enjoyable! Keep it up!
5

Thanks for the complimentary bday cake for friend! Till next time! Cheers! I would like to recommend it to my friends
5
Ask for the staff to let you check-out the buffet servings if you are keen to have it. This is the best advice I can give you. I am sure you will end up eating there anyway. Enjoy. Yes, you're welcome

5
Went for the dinner buffet on 12 October, Thursday. The Canadian oysters were really fresh, huge and super creamy. A must try for oyster lover. Other seafoods and the salmon sashimi were very fresh and sweet as well. The thai prawn appetiser was a refreshing start to the meal. The hot food — beef sirloin, pork knuckles, and yellow curry crab were delicious. The hostess Shen Ai was hospitable and very friendly. Our server Ravi were quick to top up our water and clear our plates. The kitchen staffs: Chef Kenny, Chi Wai, Sorfina, Geraldine, Nick, and MujibThey were friendly and quick to top up the food during the busy period. Overall, good dining experience at Marriott Cafe. Great variety of food and excellent standard on the seafoods. Really worth it for hotel buffet with the 30% eatigo discount. Keep up the good work!
3
We were there last Sunday when the Thai fare was running on its last day of promotion in conjunction with the usual international high tea spread.The Thai spread wasn’t huge and we were disappointed that the the sticky rice had banana on top instead of mango!Food wise, most were ok and not much to shout about although the chicken wings at the nasi lemak table were yummy. Dessert spread was also not fantastic. My husband actually threw up after some ice-cream. Wait staff did not advise that we could order any coffee or tea though they readily refill our water.
5
Food was good and service was even better. Thanks to Vic, Maria, Liz and the team for taking care of us! This place is highly recommended!
5
We had a pleasant time at Marriott cafe. Vic, Maria and Liz were very attentive to our needs. Will definitely recommend the place!
5
Locating in the best road of Singapore. The food is good and is fresh. Most important it is not over crowded and you not feel like in a fish market. Great service by Samantha and Jenny! Perfect place and atmosphere! Will be back soon for next trip
5
They have an excellent food and various selection available. I really recommend this place, my kids really enjoy the food and place. The staff are very friendly, kind and accomodating. Special thanks to Vic, AJ and Tharindi. Thank you for making my husband's birthday extra special
5
Continental breakfast is the best. Over flowing bacon. There’s even grilled steak for breakfast! Ice cream is also avalable for breakfast. Fresh fruit juices are heaven! Staff is amazing! Very friendly and super kind! Special mention to Liz for taking good care of my son. Staff is good with kids! Highly recommended to come back! We live for hotel breakfast! Breakfast for champions!

Many times in this hotel and I experience high class hospitality of the staff namely Rolando. The food was nice and we love to keep coming back to this wonderful hotel.!! I highly recommended this place for my friends and relative
4
One of the handful of buffets in town that offer shocked fresh oysters as part of lunch buffet. Nice that they cook in small portions for the buffet spread as food is not left to be overcooked from keeping food warm
5
The food is good and is fresh. Most important it is not over crowded and you not feel like in a fish marke

When we [my wife and I] stayed over at Marriott Tang, we were in this restaurant for regular Breakfast and Dinner.The breakfast Buffet spread was very good according to us. We also liked the spread at dinner.We were very impressed by the hospitality.But we did find, that cost was on the higher side
5
Price reasonableServices greatLocation goodGreat service by Mogen, Samantha and Jenny! Perfect place and atnosphere
5
Good selection of foods. Excellent service staff provided by Vic, tharindi, myra and anthony! Keep it up guys!

I would like to highly recommend the service rendered to me by David ( Manager on duty), Chai Lee, Samantha & Ravi. All of them were extremely attentive and pleasant , and displayed a high level of customer service , going the extra mile to make my friend’s birthday such a memorable one . As always the level of hospitality and service rendered by Marriott cafe staff has never failed to impress me . Thank you. Looking forward to many more return visits ...
5
We always come to this restaurant for the nice food and the excellent service of Liz and Tharindi. We will comeback agai
5
Every time I come to Singapore and stop at the Marriott Tang, I cannot escape the temptation of a meal hereFriendly service, an incredibly rich buffet from sushi, to raw fish and lobster, oysters, the pasta's and meat, cheese, Asian food... ample choice of desserts if you want to reward yourself A bit expensive, but well within Singapore standar
2
Very disappointed with our decent buffet dinner experience with Marriott Cafe, we choose marriott cafe as marriott rated 5 star hotel and we are willing to paid for $72++ per pax even after discount we still have to paid $55 per pax. The food quality was not worth the money, Crab and sashimi was not fresh and variety of food was limited. truly disappointed by the food served. Some 4 start hotel food standard is much better than Marriott, It's over price!! it's a disappointment to us!
5
I enjoyed the food and the service of the staff were excellent.. Atmosphere was excellent too. It would be great if the price could be slightly lower
5
I am super impressed by the wide variety of the food catered in the cafe as well as the friendly service from the waiters. The food is extremely delicious and I will definitely recommend it to the readers to try it out. Kudos

Good selection of cuisine; seafood, western, asian. Seafood is fresh and wide selection of desserts. Service is attentive and polite.

Awesome experience at Marriott Cafe celebrating my wife's birthday. Great selection of food. Most importantly, great attentive service by the staff, notably Samantha who showed excellent service standards in spite of the fact that she is an intern. Samantha went the extra mile to ensure that my wife and kids were well taken care of. Will be back for more

The food quality is good for a buffet this scale. Th satays are exceptionally good. The service is up to standard even with a chaotic crowd on a weekend

We've had a great time spending our lunch here in Marriott Cafe Singapore. Their food are awesome plus all the staff are very accommodating especially Vic & Liz. They made our lunch extra special by helping us celebrate my fiance bday, they gave him a cake & sing for him eventhough we didn't ask for it. Thanks a lot!!!
5
had my lunch on the 21st and i have to say that it was pretty great. ambience, staff and food deserves a compliment. was welcomed and showed to our table with a great smiling hostess. we were then asked whether we wanted warm or cold water.a trainee i supposed, named Alfie did a great job serving us and making sure the water in our glasses is always full, what a way to keep us hydrated on a warm day! he always made sure that we have room for food on our table by clearing our empty plates fast. he even offered me twg teas because he was cautious that i wasnt feeling well, and aromatic tea definitely is pretty enjoyable. he's charismatic and all smiles while serving us. his supervisor, david also offered me warm water and accommodate well to my needs. other service staff (didnt manage to get their names) also did a great job serving us.would like to thank the chefs as well for making it a scrumptious buffet. the spread was decent and the chefs there all greeted us when we pass by. this team i guess is led by Chef Kenny. when we requested him for items out of the menu, he managed to tell the other chefs to accommodate to us. Would like to also thank Chef Nino for his amazing charisma while serving our needs, personally delivering the food to us! He's a very lively individual, greeting and serving us like he's been doing for years! trainees Irfan, Jack and Ernes also did their best by serving us with all smiles at the Noodle station, Local side and Carving station respectively. and lastly would like to thank Chef Chi Wai and Raj for being humorous and lively while attending to us. what a lovely kitchen team to have!!! dessert was also good, the variety was decent.overall, i would say that for a first timer, apart from the location being easy to find, it was a great dining experience. thank you both service and kitchen staff for making it such a pleasant dining experience. am looking forward to visit again when the thai promotion comes. thank you marriott cafe!

We always enjoy our mornings having breakfast at The Marriott Cafe not only because of the good quality and mix of buffet items but more so because of the excellent and friendly service of the front of the house team. Vicky, Maria, Liz and Nita never fail to welcome us back every time we are there. They provide us with personalized service that make us feel at home
5
Excellent food and service here! The seafood harvest is a feast - fresh oysters, lobsters, crab legs, crayfish and prawns! The roast pork saddle is delicious, we've also had the pan-fried fish of the day and the steamed fish - both are yummy. Delectable desserts provide a satisfying end to the meal, coupled with warm hospitality from the friendly staff. Keep up the good work! A special mention on Samantha - thanks for the excellent service :) Will definitely be back!
5
The food is awesome especially the oyster. The service also good. All of them are very friendly and they provide very prompt response. Overall is awesome! Will come back for sure. Good service by Samantha, Jenny, Mogan, Benny, and David

Delicious food with great variety of food, value for money!!! One of my fav places for high tea buffet

5
We are currently having or buffet lunch here at Marriott Cafe and having the best lunch of our life, First of all located at Orchard, it's very easy to find and accessible. It's a very busy here but all food stations were always replenished. Interior was very nice and cozy. The atmosphere is very good. All service staff are very attentive from the service to the chefs and especially service staff. As for the food we enjoyed most is the seafood station with fresh oysters. A lot of food choices, from local to western. We experience a very excellent service from everyone especially from Ms Nida and Ms Roma, they always smile and even spend time to converse with us. Very personalized indeed. Their manager also always ensure that tables are taken care of, asked us how is everything! We are really happy to celebrate here and would highly recommend this place to everyone! We will surely come back here soon! Again Thank you Marriott Cafe Staff for the hospitality!

Brought my family members for their dinner buffet on a weekday. The food spread and selection was slightly disappointing as I remembered years back it was so much better. Other hotels have chocolate fountains which the kids was hugely disappointed at their dessert table. I must say that the seafood selection was fresh but oysters could have been much more quality. Overall, the serving staff is very prompt and friendly all the time. Great value for money only because they had a Tang's promo going at 50%
4
Good service, ambiance is also good but food is just okay. Only found it value for money because of 30 percent discount given, otherwise would not have gladly paid the full amoun
5
We are very with the service from the trainees Ms Samantha and Alfie. Seafood section has a good spread and fresh.
5
Good food quality and variation. Seafood not many options and oysters a bit small compared to other buffets. Hot dish and live station are not bad. Dessert quit good
5
Excellent food, great service staff and lovely atmosphere....will come back again for another visit
5
Great choice. Food was truly delicious. Service was 5 star. Definitely a must visit along Orchard Road
5
It was a wonderful birthday celebration at Marriott Cafe, Singapore with my friends. The Marriott staff especially Ms. Maro and Sir Anthony made it also special when they went the extra mile to prepare a cute cake and sang a birthday song for me. The food and ambience were all good. Truly memorable. From the bottom of my heart, thank you
5
Excellent food selection. Wide variety of local dishes not to miss.... Outstanding service provided, very friendly and warm. Thank you Anthony for the warm hospitable service! Welldone!
5
Celebrated our friend's birthday on 16 September at Marriot Cafe. The staff (especially Maro) were very friendly and accomodating. They even exerted effort to prepare a birthday cake for our friend. Thank you! We enjoyed and will definitely come back..
3
My first time visiting Marriott cafe. The food was average but I still enjoyed my time here. I came here with my friends who visited before. I hope that the food will be improved as I visit the next time. Nonetheless I received good service from Samantha and I'm very pleased with her Service
5
Great food selection. Friendly staff. Prepared birthday cake for our friend. Sweet! Will definitely come back.
5
We had an amazing time at Marriott Cafe!!! The buffet spread was amazing, their accommodating staff, Maro and Anthony are just the best and made sure that my friend' s birthday was well taken cared off. Thank you!!! Will definitely be back again
5
It was such a nice buffet spread for a high tea/birthday celebration of our girlfriend. Staff were very accomodating, thanks to Maro and Anthony for making our friend's day happy and fun. As a vegetarian, I had plenty choices.
4
This is a cafe where the hotel has taken the trouble to make sure there is a range of food for patrons to choose from. The food quality is also quite good. The entire spread is accessible, and the food is not too oily as well. There are both Asian and Western food to choose from. The only grouse I would have is that because the food dishes are all gathered at the same place, walking around to pick the items can be a bit of an issue
5
Food was great. Excellent service from Jenny and Chun Yi. Attentive service and very welcoming from the supervisor Maro. Thank you so much!
4
Nice food and excellent service. Seafood are fresh and dessert selection is good. Staff are very friendly and helpful especially Jenny and Ajay who are serving us. Will come and dine again.
5
The food is very very delicious. The service is very good as they are very fast in serving be it water , coffee , tea or collecting your plates .

5
We like this Marriott caffe for delicious food and excellent service staff by Manager Benny,Vic,Maria Anita Liz and Anthon
4
Overall, the food was pretty good, but the seafood especially was fresh and delicious. We would also like to commend Alfie & Myra for their excellent service. Thank you for making our dining experience so much more enjoyable
2
Overall, the lunch buffet was disappointing. The standard of food has dropped. Hainanese chicken rice was not as fragrant as my favourite coffee shop chicken rice. Pan fried chicken was too dry. Pumpkin soup was bland. Boiled veggie with oyster sauce was limp, lifeless and bland. Aloo ghobi was salty, not aromatic as one expects it to be. Laksa was so-so, and missing a key ingredient: fishcake!! Sushi was ok, not too impressive. Salad spread was a bit limited. Hummus was alright.Service was good, and staff were attentive. Coffee and tea (TWG) were good enough. Fruits were fresh enough.Won't be going back, given the pricing. One expects top notch standards at the price, not mediocre fare..
5
Food is super nice.i enjoyed my lovely evening in Marriott hotel cafe. Staff here are friendly quick to respond.
5
Nice service by Ms. Myra and a big thanks to Ms. Maro for the effort on making cakes..We appreciate it very well..we will come back for sure and recommend with friends and family.😉😉😉
5
👍👍👍i will recommend to friends and family...thanks...easy to find and service are good...myra thank you for good service... nice food...
5
Everything is good, service staff excellent - Alfie n Ajay. Ambience is great. Good selection of food! Highly recommended!
3
Chilled seafood was good and fresh. The crab was sweet and delicious. Carved roast beef and crispy pork were great and had a lot of different choices of sauces to pick from.However, the local dishes and other cooked dishes were rather lacking. Chilli crab was too sweet, roast duck was too dry and tough. And the other dishes were very average.The staff were efficient and nice, and gave us some recommendations.All in all, not really worth the full paying price unless you really enjoy the seafood and carved meats
5
The dining experience was one-of-a-kind. Delicious and wonderful range of food. ToTop it off was the superb service provided by Alfie & Ajay. Excellent work, plse keep it u
5
There's lots of variety in Marriott Café. I love their raw salmon and the smoke salmon as it's extremely fresh. They even serve me a cake as it's my birthday that day
5
Great value and quality of food! Staff is very friendly and attentive. Good location as its just above Orchard MRT. The spread of food is not as many as other similar hotels but still good value for the price - we got a good deal as Tangs Members. Overall, good experience and would recommend to friends
5
Good spread of dishes. Got a promo of $168++ for 4 pax. Excellent service from Maro and Vic! All smiles and wonderful customer service is what completes our excellent dine-in experience
5
It was really a dinning experience, the food and ambiance was spectacular. A great customer service brought by maro and vic even made the whole experience more wonderful and delightful. A million percent we will back for more
5
Currently having lunch here today at Marriott Cafe. Excellent service from Maro and Vic! Thanks so much!!!!

5
Excellent service Polite staff namely Samantha m Alfie n Mogan.Food was average .Should hv more continental varieties then d cold dishe
3
First time dined at Marriot Cafe. The food is not up to my expectations as I would expect a wide choices. Not much selections
5
This is a great high end buffet,with great seafood and a good Japanese Sushi and Sashimi. They have many other items including Pasta Station, Carvery section, Asian Section, Salad bar and dessert. Really enjoyed the self service wine buffet which you can buy as an upgrade to your buffet.Excellent Service by all Staff , Special thanks goes to David the Manager on duty
4
Overall a pretty good dining experience. The variety was greatly appreciated with a mix of international food from Western to Asian food. The ice cream bar is a nice touch! The Singaporean Chili Crab omelette is not recommended as the unique flavor is pretty much just sauce and nothing to do with the ingredients. The juice bar was great and a good mix of fruits and yogurts. Everyone was really great and helpful so I would rate the service very highly
5
This has got to be one of the best buffet in Singapore. This restaurant serves a large variety of food and the meat at the meat stations were amazing. I loved the seafood selections as they were very fresh and the lobster was so awesome. Please make a reservation if you are heading there for dinner as it is always fully book and very crowded
5
Visited the Marriott Cafe for the buffet with my family of 4. Food is pretty decent and friendly staff. Had this very friendly and attentive staff Vic serving us. Keep up the great work.
3
I was really excited to dine at Marriott Cafe, considering it was rated one of the best and its pictures online looked vibrant and mouth-watering. Sadly, I did not enjoy the food and selection. The seafood was not fresh and the food was not phenomenal.. It was alright, not terrible either, just not somewhere I'd go again for a special occasion.
5
We've been to Marriott Cafe several times before, but this time we brought a few friends from overseas to celebrate my birthday. I'm so glad I did. We enjoyed the great service and food. Special thanks to Benny, Nita and Jenny who made my birthday even more special with the birthday cake they brought in, i was truly surprised. Thank you Marriott for making my birthday a memorable one

Went for buffet dinner on 2 Sep. Would like to compliment the attentive friendly service crews on duty that night. They worked diligently and kept our table clean all the time. A male staff offered us fresh coffee when my husband asked about not seeing any coffee pot around. He went the extra mile to offer my children babycino as well. Thumbs up for his impeccable service, didnt check his name tag though.As for food, the seafood were replenished quickly n generously. The oysters were fresh, crab legs were sweet but lobster were not as good as expected. We didnt try the prawns and crayfish probably they don look very enticing... I love the pork saddle, it was great n skin was crispy. A suggestion to the uncle at carving station, do wear a smile on face and do serve customer more than a slice if they asked, coz it is likely that they like it n will be able to finish the food they asked for ^_^Ice cream were fresh, fragrant and smooth. I understand they made it on their own. Dessert selection were quite disappointing. It had the least selection I had seen by far for hotel buffet... nevertheless my children were happy enough with the small chocolate fountain and exceptional sweet pineapples at the corner.I would recommend this buffet if go under credit card promo price, otherwise the full price is rather steep for the food selections offered. Service crews made us had an enjoyable night. Thank you
5
Excellent service great food Thanks for the cake marriott my best birthday celebration ever .Thanks to maro for the great service .Kudos to the staff. God bless 
5
We had a great HI TEA at the same time celebrating my friend's bday! The food was awsome and was complemented with good a service from their staff,especial to MAR
4
The seafood selection is good and fresh. Salmon sashimi and oysters are really fresh. Good service as well. My gal's birthday today and they arranged a slice of cake for her and sang her a birthday song
4
We had dinner at the Marriott Cafe and the spread was pretty good. The cold prawns were fresh and sweet, beef chuck were tender and juicy. The parma ham with melon was awesome. For desserts, one must not forget to mention the signature sticky date pudding. It is indeed good and not very sweet.Service staff are prompt in clearing the plates and courteous. Special mention- Ms Jenny whom we understand is from Taiwan serving her internship at Marriot Cafe. She is very friendly and attentive. Good job, keep it up! When she served the birthday cake to my mum, she joined us to sing the birthday song together. We hope she will enjoy her internship in Singapore
5

Celebrated my birthday last Sunday with my family for a buffet lunch. There's a wide variety of food. Love the fresh seafoods,sushi bar and desserts. Just a bit rush as we arrived at about 1pm and lunch period ends at 2:30pm. But what makes the visit special was the excellent service of the staff especially Maro and Vic. Highlights of the lunch was when they both presented me a slice of cake with birthday candle. Really appreciate the great service. Will be back soon

This is our third time last Friday (brought out of town family member this visit). Very nice and fresh seafood, especially the lobsters. The seafood was also replenished continuously. DUSTIN was our waiter and he was assigned to the whole area behind Java+. He was extremely hardworking (compared to other waiter n hostess) and his service was always with a smile. Thank you
5
Lovely brunch today A very good experience! Wonderful variety of spread plus friendly and accommodating staffs. Kudos to the Chefs and to Ms Maro. Added this to one of my best dining experience on a gorgeous Sunday, friendly people adds up to perfection

Excellent service from the staff and especially one waitress in particular by the name of Samantha. Well done

My family and I were impressed with the service of Ms. She Hui from Marriott Cafe. Even though the evening were crowded, Ms. She Hui was attentive to guest and fulfill our request. Service with a smile is always with Ms. She Hui. Keep up the excellent service

I had a lunch today with a dearest Friend. Even though the Restaurant was packed,the hostess was able to give us a table. Thank you for assisting us' very good service provided by the crew and the supervisor Maro. We enjoyed our meal and will definitely come back! Thank you'

Vic who serves our coffee with a smile2. Maro who helps giving coffee and sharing some nice places to visit in Singapore3. Raj whose courtesy and stories will help you lose track of time while waiting for your orders at the egg statio

Came for dinner with wife, sister in law and her husband. Seafood was spotty ... oysters, lobsters and crab were nice. Lobster claw not so much. Sashimi was fresh and delicious. Selected a Bramare Malbec vina cobos 2008 ... fantastic especially as it was on promotion. What made the evening great was the service by She Hui. She went out of the way to explain the free flow wine promotion, the selection of wine and the wine list. She was patient and always cheerful. After the meal, she even automatically offered to make a freshly brew coffee when only coffee in a pot was offered. Thank you Hui for your fantastic service!
5
The service is good with one dedicated staff named SHE HUI offering honey for my pepper mint tea. She has initiated the suggestion on her own.
4
very prompt in refilling food at buffet counter. staff is very polite. ambience is good.but variety of food is too Asian.
5
 In this cafe, you will have a great experience in terms of service and good food. You will feel at home, as most of their staff were courteous and accomodative. Staff like Ms. Vic, serving your coffee with smile, Mr. Raj, frying your eggs with great stories, Ms. Maro, who's recommending some good places in the country. Food offering were delicious. Marriot cafe, two thumbs up.....
5
Our breakfasts have always had a great start because of the piping hot coffee served with a smile by Vic. Maro made sure that we not only enjoy the best food but that we were comfortable doing so. I didn't order omelette but Raj was quite a sight as he prepared them for my colleagues. His sunny side ups perks your mornings.
5
Hi, I would like to thank Mr. Chai Lee and Ms.Jenny our server for providing a wonderful service and being patient while serving us. Thus, giving us a complementary birthday cake while having a delightful dinner at Marriott cafe. Nonetheless, we will definitely return
3
Staffs are friendly but some forgetful. 3 times we order the tea. Total 20mins then it was deliver to us. Cold sector, seafood not fresh. Found fish bone in salmon and sand or small hard particles inside the oyster. Could have more variety or better spread
5
The food is delicious and have a lot of food variety. The price is also ressonable and worth trying
5
It's our first time to dine at Marriott Café. We came to celebrate my hubby's birthday. The staff are very friendly and excellent in service. Special thanks to Ms Maro & Ms Myra who gave us a very pleasant experience- their service is highly commendable. We will definitely come back and recommend this resto to our friends and family.
5
Samantha Toh is friendly and approachable. She smiles to customers and make them comfortable. Her pleasant personality definitely is well suited for hospitality industry.Given the appropriate training, I am confident that she will excel further than now as an internship student. Keep it up.Will return for the food again. Thanks Samantha for her great service
5
Thanks To Myra And Maro,We Were Able To Book A Table At The Buffet To Celebrate My Birthday,The Food Was Delicious.Good Service,Looking Foward To Visit This Hotel Again!!
5
Thank you for the excellent service by Samantha and She Hui! I came Marriott Cafe a few times and I'm pleased with the service. Great Job
5
My bf and I go to Marriott cafe yesterday. It was a nice buffet. Food was good, especially lobster and prawn. The tea was also nice, too. The staff, Myra and Jenny, they provide great service to us. They were very friendly and helpful. Because of nice food and excellent staff, we will come back again
4
I like how the seafood were topped up really fast and they are very fresh. The selection of food is so-so only though. Get the carbonara, it is nice. As I went on Sunday night, it was really crowded.
4
Good arrangement of delicious food and cleanliness of Marroitt cafe. Free flow of juices on every Sunday only. Price is reasonable
5
Me and my Wife have been eating in marriott cafe in almost all special occasions. Every famished visit is always a full satisfying feast. As what they normally say "the way to man's heart is through his belly" good food and good customer service is what makes Marriott worth the drop-in.Special thanks to Maro and Team on making our bellies happy.Looking forward on a feast again and again and again.
5
Very nice ambient, food is of reasonable quality (good value for money). All the staff are very courteous (especially Samantha, who was very polite and attentive).In all, a very nice experience and we will certainly be back for more. Richard Lau Jane Chen &Clara LIU.

Came with my wife for weekday high tea buffet. Food was good and great service by Samantha. Food variety can be improved.
4
Food & ambiance was good. Quite a good selection of seafood but a pity the seafood were mainly served on ice and not so much in their hot dishes. Quality tea of my choice is served after meal. Service wise lack slightly, we informed our table was shaky. The staff acknowledged but did not do anything to fix it. Just slotting a cupboard to balance the table would already help. In the end, we saw how busy everyone was so we dined throughout as it is. They had live pianist providing soothing music too. Thanks for the credit card promo, we'll be back
5
We visited Singapore for our anniversary and all we can say it's that we have an amazing dinner experience with one of the best restaurants "Marriott Cafe"".The food is so delicious plus how the staff is treating their guests which I think this is the best edge of the cafe from the other competitors. Special thanks to MARO who is so helpful yet in professional way and to the rest of the staff! You did a great job! We will see u again soon:
5
Went for Afternoon tea and was overwhelmed with lots of people eating in the place. The restaurant offers a spread of good local food for a good price
5
The food was good and the service was great. Good ambience as well. The prawns were the best dish and the dessert was really good
5
Went here last week with friends. Phenomenal food, fast service and definitely worth the money. Five star experience because of the service of Maro and Mogan. Maraming Salamat, Marriot Cafe
5
Second time here in Singapore and I took some time and liberty to visit Marriot Cafe once again. The phrase, "It only gets better the second time!", is appropriate in this instance.The staff were great and hospitable especially Maro and She Hui. Food was better this time, maybe new chef since I last visited. But definitely will come back again.Au Revoir SingaporeMerci beaucoup, Marriot Cafe
5
The Marriot name never seem to disappoint.The buffet spread is a lot from local, western and even dessert. Good food.But what stuck to me was the service of Maro and Myra. Friendly, accomodating and exceptionally brilliant. Will definitely come back for the service
5
Food is Superb esp the sea foods. Service is excellent; especial thanks to Myra and Maro for they are so friendly and approachable, highly recommended!!
5
Went dinner with colleague.Service is very good,staff very helpful and accommodating.We were serve with Maira and Maro.Got so many food to choose from

Marriot Cafe provided a very memorable experience. As a frequent traveler, it is the best to try and sample food from different places and Singapore is no different. If you get a chance to visit Singapore, spend your time in this cafe.My family and I were craving for seafood and more for my brother's birthday Being at the heart of Orchard (corner of Orchard Rd and Scotts), the location was great and easily found. Marriot hotel and its affiliates has always been an epitome of high-class and service, but this buffet-restaurant pushes the standards even more.Let's start with the hostess counter. I believe her name is Myra. Pleasantly suprise that I was greeted with a smile and even with my inquiries, she was able to answer them as informative as possible. Immediately after finalizing my card discounts (yes, you should ask!!), her colleagues was already warmly escorting my family to our seats. Now, the ambience. For a buffet restaurant, it is expected to be a lot of people. It was jampacked and the demographics show that even the local Singaporeans frequent the place. Talk about popularity - thats how you know the place will be great. A tad side note though, due to the arrangement of the tables, you may feel a little cramped. Best to have 4 people in one table. Now, the service. I believe She Hui served my table. Efficient, friendly, informative and definitely funny. She made the dinner vibrant for the family engaging with my relatives, answering my questions about Singapore and most importantly the promptness of her care. For God's sake, there was never an empty plate nor an empty glass on my table for more than 30 seconds. It was that efficient. Let's go to food. Entering the buffet, I was told by an executive Maro that there are three choices - the local cuisine, the western, and seafood. There are also salad and dessert bar. Maro went out of her way to assist us and tour us around the choices due to our unfamiliarity with some of the dishes. But good heavens, it was flavorsome. Kudos to the chef. Singapore really does offer amazing food choices. The seafood was bountiful. The spread included shrimps, crayfish, crab, sushi and oysters; my family feasted on it. Next, the dessert. See my picture. It was the best way to end the meal. I kinda pigged out in the dessert. As it was my brother's birthday, they gave us a slice of cake. Myra, She Hui, Maro and 2 others sang a gleeful birthday song for him. The other two people, I couldnt catch their names but their tags says In-Training. For interns to be that excellent, it says a lot about the quality of the place. The cafe and their management really focus in their trainees.Overall, it was a memorable birthday celebration and thank you Marriot Cafe for hosting us so wonderfully.Price: 80++ before discount.It's pricey but DEFINITELY WORTH IT
5
Thank you marriott cafe for always providing me a table. Thank you for treating me verygood not only as a guest but also like a family. I would like to thanks Mr Anthony,Ms Maro and Shen ai for your great hospitality!!!! I always love to come here because of you. Thank you! Looking forward to see you every hitea period. Thanks to Beny and Myra as well for being friendly and attentive
5
Mid-week dinner with dear friends and we thought of having ala carte here for a change. We love the food. The Jack Daniel's BBQ babyback Rib is a must try! Fall-off the bone tender, perfectly glazed and so love that slightly sweet & spicy sauce! Yum! I'm still craving for that sticky date pudding up to now! It is simply divine! How I wish I can just call in to have one delivered here instantly. Best of all is the superb service from everyone who attended to us ... to Chef Nino, Mogan, Anthony, Maro, Samantha, Pranav, Dustin and to Myra our Hostess. You guys are truly awesome. Thank you and we will definitely be back!
5
Very nice food and wine! friendly staff especially Maro, Anthony, Chef Niño & Dustin! Would definitely recommend to friends!
5
Great to celebrate anniversary at this wonderful place. We love the ambiance, friendly staff, very good food and excellent service.. surely will come back here. Especial mention to excellent service of Anthony, Chef Nino, Maro and Mogan!Well done guys, keep it up!- Ma

Went to High Tea with my brother last Saturday and was impressed by the service provided! Service Staff Dustin and Samantha was super friendly and attended to us. They were nice enough to answer our questions despite the Cafe being quite busy! Was a bit sad that juices are not part of the buffet and only coffee tea are complimentary but nonetheless the food was great! The seafood spread is quite huge. The food was great such as the local food like nasi lemak and Chicken rice. The spread was quite big and would come to Marriott Cafe again. Just make sure to make a reservation before coming
3
Only offer water to us. It was my gf birthday and I have said in my reservation notes but they never offer any cakes to us (Many other hotels will offer birthday cake and staff will sing birthday song)
5
The service here is fantastic & the food is good too.We like to thank Manager Benny & her staff Dustin,Myra,Prabal Mogan for their excellent service and I will highly recommend to all my friends to have their Celebration in this restaurant and is value for money
3
Seafood are good. Other types of food are average. Not much variety. Service is good. Nice ambience.
4
The first thing when I stepped into the restaurant, was to realize how small the buffet was. There wasn't much variety for hot food, although I really enjoyed the pasta corner. Other than that everything was okay. But something that impressed me was the service provided by the staff, especially from she hui. I have been to a few buffets in Singapore and this is the first time there was actually proper service provided by the staff. Really attentive and patient.
3
food variety was standard... it was 1st hour into the buffet & many items were not topped up...staff wasn't bothered in topping up food items like laksa leaves for the famous laska station... restaurant was dirty... wish they are more mindful with cleaning..
5
To Maro, Ling and Beny,They have a fantastic service...we were really attended and taking care of. We couldn't ask for a better if not, great service!!! Thank you guys!!! 'Till next time!
5
The outside cafe is great to relax and have a drink in.Plenty of overhead fans to cool you down and happy hour cocktails and kir royals.Good menu,not cheap but you are on Orchard Road.Staff attentive and pleasant
5
Good food and variety. Special thanks to the staff Ms Maro, Ms Vic, Mr Aditya and Mr Ajay for being very hospitable and patient
5
Amazing food, love the braised beef. Special thanks to our servers, Ms Maro, Mr Ajay and Mr Aditya for taking the time to talk to us despite their busy schedule :) great place to grab lunch, 10/10 would reccomen
5
Great food and atmosphere. Special thanks to Ms Maro, Ms Nita and Ms Vic for being patient and kind and engaging with us :

We dined @ marriott cafe for breakfast. Wide selection of food. Outstanding service by Ling,winnie,maria and the two supervisors namely Ms Beny and Ms.Maro. friendly and warm service was provided for our family. Thank you so much!
5
Excellent service here in Marriott cafe, especially their staff.I commend ms. Maro for assisting us. :
5
Enjoyed ourselves thoroughly there with the good spread of food. Lunch made more special with a complimentary birthday cake from Vic and Rini, and accompanied with a birthday song. Great service! Thank you ladies
5
Enjoying my high tea at a cosy environment including friendly staff. One of the staff, Samantha has been very helpful and friendly - awesome!
5
We traveled as couple visiting Singapore for a few days which I can say it was the best days in my life . The hotel and location was so perfect , hotel staff they was so helpful .

5
Excellent service by myra and maro. Great food and great ambience. Its a great experience to be here.
5
Me and my hubby celebrated our anniversary here 2 years in a row! We really love the selection of dishes and the selection of cold cuts and cheeses, yum! They are the only ones who have an overflowing mozzarella cheese! (Others don't). What makes a good restaurant is the people. The staff here are very helpful and friendly. I want to thank the manager in charge that day for making our anniversary date extra special. I think her name is Maro, she pleasantly answers our questions and even explained to us the varieties of wine when we wanted to order. She also prepared a cake for us after finding out that we were celebrating our anniversary. Thank you Marriott! Keep it up. Looking forward to our next celebration for sure we'll keep coming back
5
It's very good service at marriott cafe. Staffs are very good. Paying good attention to us. Making sure we have more space to put our foods. Excellent!!!
2
Food variety not much. Not really worth if paying full price. Hot mains are served in rather small pots and quantity is limited too. Plus there is only 1 type of green vegetables being served.
4
We were there as a big group for dinner and Maro and her team were really accommodating to all our requests. Refills to our drinks were done very promptly even though the restaurant was quite packed that day. Great work, Maro :
5
Shen Ai and Samantha are very friendly , attentive and the smile on their faces and service excellent . Very glad to see such faces when we dine in. Thk

Had an impromptu booking at Marriott Cafe to celebrate a friend's birthday on the 19th July 2017. Upon arrival at the restaurant at Singapore Marriott Tang Plaza, we were greeted by the hospitable staffs with friendly smiles on their faces and a warm welcome, and were shown to our seats. Water was served and we went to the buffet section. Despite being a weekday, we were impressed with the wide selection at the buffet table; from salmon sashimi, sushi platters, live oysters, baby lobsters, asian delights like wok fried kailan and roasted duck. They also have osso bucco, peri peri chicken and live station serving roasted pork belly and roast beef and also a live pasta station where you can customise your own pasta to your liking. Not forgetting, a wide selection of desserts ranging from cakes, puddings and ice creams.Service was excellent. We want to give special thanks and praises to Chai Lee and Azura, who were constantly refilling our glasses with water and also clearing our empty plates. We also want to thank Mr Wayson and Ms Yayo for keeping us well entertained. We were also very touched by Chai Lee's sweet gesture by preparing a birthday cake for our friend.Well done and a big thank you to the staffs of Marriott Cafe
5
This was my 3rd time here over november december 2016I was expecting something special and Marriott certainly delivered.We had to book and prepay because of christmas day but that was no problem.I then visited another 2 times Feb 2017 and April 2017.Let me say the Seafood everytime was proper fresh selected Seafood.When the sign says large Sydney rock oysters they were the real deal.Likewise the crab lobster and prawns just perfect crunch strong flavours.Meat carvery Selection Australian wagyu RoastBeefAustralian Legs of LambSalads vegetables sauces desserts just perfect.Not a large Restaurant but very good service and hosts.10/10 Marriott Cafe Tang plazaTaxi rank at door appreciated
5
Visited here for buffet dinner. Food variety was not bad. seafood selection with Fresh oysters, crab legs and baby lobsters on a weekday. However, the staffs service was impeccable! Namely, Wayson, Chai lee, Maro, Azura. Responsive and efficient, attending to all our requests. Chai lee even surprised us with a cake for my friend birthday. We really enjoyed ourselves and thank you for the wonderful service!
3
The 1 for 1 buffet weekday dinner menu was the same as the weekend high tea (1 for 1) but the price is a big difference 
5
Maro, She Hui, Mogan, Shen Ai, Chai Lee thank you for the excellent service provided. Great food, friendly service & tip top service, good value for money. Wide variety of food, well done Chefs! Surely we will come back!
5
we are very much impressed with the service provided by she hui, chai lee, shen ai, mogan. and maro. very warm and friendly environment! thank you marriott!
5
outstanding service by she hui,jenny & maro. sumptous food! good job marriott! keep it up! will comeback again!
5
Service is very good. And the food is amazing! Will definitely come back again. It was worth it! :) :
5
Was here tonite to celebrate my birthday. Food was good, lobster's fresh. Love their oyster. Sweet & some very plump, goes well with Tabasco & Lime. Their salmon belly was smooth and fresh too. Beef was done just right, not over baked. Nice selection of dessert too.
2
Went for the high tea today . Walked in and was informed that it was fully booked. However, they managed to prepare me 3 seats . To my surprise the seats are makeshift seats in a very weird setup apart from the normal seats .Observed for 45 mins and realised that indeed they are available seats and questioned the manager why the current seats is so 'special' .The 'special' relates to a poor dinning position and seat allocated despite that it wasn't really fully booked.Told the manager that we do not deserve to have such a poor experience with 2 olds folks with me.Very lousy in the way they manage the experience toda
5
The Marriott Café seafood dinner Buffet indulgence was simply delicious with generous variety that included oysters and lobsters, although hubby does not consume seafood. Decadent desserts were balanced with healthy fresh fruits. Breakfast at the Marriott Café was delightful with a wide selection, including traditional Singapore-Malaysian food. After all, we visit Singapore to enjoy the local cuisine too
4
The buffet at the Marriott Cafe has good quality. I have ate there more than 15 times. They have fresh oysters, lobsters a wide variety of cakes, salad, sushi, sashimi, cold-cut meat,ice-cream, roast meat, pasta, noodles, roast chicken, roast pork, bake salmon, etc. The service is quite good too
3
I frequent Marriot cafe for their buffet breakfast on 9th July and I always love it for their high food quality and small details that was put in its food and drinks options. But this morning, I was a little disappointed and felt quite a few things missing from the usual good experience. -Back bacon missing -streaky bacon was very poorly done, all clumped together and crushed. In the last few visits, every piece of the bacon is seperated and not crushed. Makes one think this is done by a 3star hotel-all rustic breads was not replenished automatically the whole morning, even though I've informed the staff-sesame bread sticks missing-yakult missing-whipped cream missing -the usual big nice buttery and fluffy croissant was dry and was not replenished promptly. The 2nd batch that came out was only mini croissants which was disappointing. -takeaway cups for smoothie were without lids ( there are cups but no lids? Something amiss here ? )I wonder what has gone wrong. It's such a pity that the usual high food quality has such hiccups. With all said, the service received from the waiters and waitresses is still superb.I hope the marriot management is reading this post and get things fixed back to normal. I would certainly wish to go back to my favourite breakfast place without being disappointed again.
5
We had family buffet dinner at Marriott Cafe, a time to get together with children who are usually away from home pursuing respective study/NS obligations. Marriott Cafe provided a great ambient for nice chatting time, catch up and wind down - fitting a Saturday evening. The buffet has a good spread. Would have expected more variety is the dessert spread, nevertheless, overall, it was "excellent". The staff were very helpful and professional. Coffee was served promptly on request. Though most of the tables were taken, the table arrangements made it as if like we had our own private space. We had great time chatting and eating till the cafe reached closing time :)
5
Pretty extensive buffet offering lots of options for everyone. I am a vegan so it's not easy to find good food everywhere, this restaurant gave me more than I could enjoy. With over 13 specialized and gourmet options, it's worth budgeting a decent amount of time here. The noodle station in particular is incredible, includes about 12 noodle and vegetable epicurean ingredients to choose from, plus a great protein selection. The condiments were also very generously displayed, so you could really get to the profile you personally enjoy the most. The juice bar also extraordinary; lots of fresh ingredients available, they will make the juice with the combination of ingredients you desire. In addition, they have about 15 different fresh juices ready to serve. Worth staying at the hotel just to have this breakfast everyday.
5
It is an incredible breakfast spread, not to be missed, whether you are a guest or not. Even during lunch or tea time the place is packed with upscale locals, so you know it is good,.
5
Had hi tea with friends, nice buffet food , a lot of selection. like the noodle station can choose what u want .Friendly staff even the chef at counter .Continue with the good food and service 
4
Overall good experience, prawns and salmon sashimi was very fresh. Pasta cooked at the live station was very good. Mushroom soup was good. Laksa lacked coconut milk and tasted more like curry noodles. However, the dessert area needs improvement as the cake wasn't cold hence affecting the texture which is disappointing as the cakes tasted very good. Bread & butter and sticky date pudding is delicious! Worth the visit if there's a discount as the spread can be improved. Service was fantastic, servers were attentive and friendly - Ajay in particular.
5
Had dinner with my husband and his friends from overseas and they were very happy with the wide variety in Marriott Cafe especially the seafood section plus the location is a winner! My daughter enjoyed the pasta & cheese section very much. Great efficient service by Benyleen and Sharon was attentive and friendly to my daughter. Overall a good experience and will come back again.
3
Had the unfortunate experience of eating here during lunch on a public holiday. The selection was subpar. Service was average: spoons and saucers ran out and were not replenished. The best item was the cream of pumpkin soup. The worst was the salmon sashimi. Took a bite and could not eat it any further. It had a overtly fishy odour.My experience was confirmed by three other diners in my party.Feedback was given to Vic, the waitress. To her credit, she promptly came back, saying that the chef has said that the salmon would be replaced. However, a few minutes later, David, the customer service executive, came and said that they had tasted the salmon sashimi and it was "not spoilt." He further stated that "fish was fishy". His tone veered towards the defensive. I expected better from a customer service executive of a brand name hotel chain. One politely wonders whether David has ever had proper salmon sashimi. Perhaps a trip to a good Japanese restaurant and a customer service refresher course is in order. On a side note, I found Vic and Donald (the manager) to be excellent in their service
4
Very good lunch buffet, not crowded, great for an unhurried lunch. Wide selection of Asian, western and fresh seafood. Good dessert selection. However, the restaurant also serves high tea from 3pm, which means last helping at 2pm and prodding you to vacate by 2.30pm, which is a tad annoying.
5
Great place for nice food and sit down for a chat. Food choices changes from time to time. With alot of variety for different occasions. Will recommend this place to my friends.
3
We found it strange that we were served only with a fork and knife on the table as we arrived for the buffet dinner. no serviettes too. I thought there are usually more cutlery on the table for buffet? I was wondering how I should eat food like fried rice and when I requested for a spoon, I received a teaspoon. A teaspoon for rice/ soup? The service was random in standard. Much room for improvement on the dining floor. A male Chef who prepared the fish and curry at the food area made up for the shortfall though. He was polite and nice. The food variety was very limited. It can be given a total miss if you are not using any credit card promotions.
4
Firstly, the establishment assigns a certain number for its promotion rates. Hence initially we were put on waitlist. Even after being confirmed there wasn't any notifications. Fortunately we called in again to check and found out it was confirmed, otherwise we would have just went somewhere else. A good and decent spread with fresh poached prawns, selection of sushi and cured salmon for seafood. Mainly a local spread high tea with chicken rice, satay, laksa, etc. Which were all pretty decent. But the chicken tend to be a little dry cause mostly it's served room temperature but estab has placed it in a warmer. Fried carrot cake and fried kway Teow were only mediocre cause it very wet and the condensation made it worse. Now moving on to the supposed durian dessert. Definitely not worth going for these as the main, cause you'd be disappointed. Durian pizza was innovative but a totally weird out experience. Service was prompt and efficient, a little too passionate cause we were still holding our cutlery and the staff wanted to clear it away, we could hardly say no with our mouths still chewing. All in all, if you're paying a promotional rate then it's worth the experience. But full price is definitely a miss.
5
The food was good, some of it was a bit disappointing but overall all the food was satisfactory! The ambiance was excellent, I had a window table overlooking Orchard road
3
Nice afternoon to catch up with friends.Ambience was great. We had tried decaf n non-decaf coffees n teas. I'm not into sugar food so had ordered a Cod Fish n chips. It was yummy n fish was fresh!Staff were attentive although some hiccups on delay of a coffee serving
4
Service is good and the buffet spread is great. Could improve a little on the desserts thou. Overall a good experience
4
The variety is excellent. A wide variety of juices, bread & pastry and live station for omelette and noodles. There is even Yakult for the children:) also ba kut teh soup is great to try:)The ambience is soothing with instrumental music. You can choose to sit inside or outside the restaurant. Choice of seatings for couples to family size. If you need to work on laptops with charging, request for bar seating facing glass window. Perhaps a good 1.5hr breakfast time here is good! On weekends, at 7.30am, it is not too crowded yet:) people start coming at 8.30am her
4
Excellent High tea Buffet with many choices in all regional cuisines like Malay, Thai,Singapore local, Indonesian etc with good value for money.Can be recommended for any food love
4
A wonderful spot on the crossroads to sit in the cool and watch the world go by.Third time I've been here for lunch,,always sat outside and loved it every time. Great selection of food,but was a bit shocked this time to find that my favourite Rueben Sandwich was no longer on the menu.However,being the Marriott,they still made one for me and it was as good as ever.Expensive,as you would probably expect(especially the drinks),but first class in both cuisine and service.Can't envisage a trip to Singapore without my favourite spot - a must

I just had a worst Hi tea experience at marriot cafe . After so many years of visiting there . Me and my wife thought we can relish our good experience of having our buffet there along with our kid. First of all. I've booked through chope a month ago in celebration for my wife birthday. the below summarises my experiences;1) long queues of aunties outside waiting to sit in for the 3pm hi tea. and they do not allow you to sit first if you are early. 2) food is "Asian style " . consists of hawker style food you can get at hawker centres . e.g. carrot cake . mee goreng. chicken wings. chicken rice and so on. 3) if you think you can use their one for one promo. at least that offset the price for what you are getting. you are in for a surprise . you have to indicate in your Early booking that you will be using the dbs 1 for 1 or they wouldn't give you . And they really make sure you don't enjoy the offer they advertise by asking you do you have citibank ? and when I asked her where in the chope app can I Specify that I can enjoy the offer. You will really be in for a great surprise. well. this may be the last we will be visiting there. anyway . who wants expensive but cheap buffet ? well . this is one place to be .

We had a lovely high tea at Marriot Cafe with the family. The service was very good and friendly. There is a wide choice of coffee and tea offered. The high tea was served with sandwiches, sausage rolls, savouries, scones, cholocates.

Enjoy the family dinner at Marriott cafe on last Saturday. Good seafood variety and hot food selection. The environment is very nice and the staff as wellWe are party of 8 and be seated near to the fountain. The Chinese young man chailee (hope the spelling is correct) provided a very well hospitality to us. Thx so much. He is busy to take care all the table alone. But he still well check back table by table offer us coffee tea! Well done dude. My Mom was very enjoy with his service. Thumb up!!

ON the 13th Apr, My buddy and I went down for hi-tea @ Marriott Cafe. We were first welcome with by a friendly and thoughtful staff named David. First, he gave us a sofa seat which he said that it will be very comfortable for us with my daughter. It was very helpful because my daughter could have her nap while we enjoy our meal on the sofa. Then David passed by and saw my daughter napping and he offered to get a cushion for my daughter so she can sleep comfortably. 3rd, they kept my baby mat when I left the place until we came back to retrieve it.We were very welcome by the great service of the staff and esp David. Thank you so much for making our meal so memorable

Beverage-: We were given 4 types of tea and 4 types of coffee to choose from . I had a cup of cappuccino , follow by a big pot of Flamingo Tea. Both beverages were well prepared . The cappuccino was bitter enough for me and Tea with a fruity taste were nice. Food-: The food was served in a three-tier serving stand-: Bottom layer - savoury fares such as cucumber sandwiches , tuna sandwiches , egg sandwiches , pastry such as curry , sausage and quicheMiddle layer - sweet fares such as coconut roll , mini strawberry tart, mini chocolate cake , white chocolate ball shape , donut and mini strawberry fresh cream mousse cake Top layer - Raspberry macarons , scones and chocolate pralines The sultana scones was smaller than the full size scones offered at other place . However , the size did affect the taste all time. In fact , I would rate the scones as very good . I was able to break the scones into halves without crumbs (thumb up). It was slightly 'crispy' on the outside but it was soft and moist on the inside . The clotted cream was good enough . They offered orange marmalade, apricot jam and strawberry jam. Service & Hospitality Arin seemed to be the only server on duty . After serving our food and drinks , she left us to have our space . However , I find it a little difficult to get her attention at times as she had to serve all the tables which were spaced out . Arin was very friendly and hospitality. She had a warm lovely smile on her face throughout our stay . She does return rather frequently with food to replenish our plates . She made us feel welcome . Never once did she make us as if we had taken too much food . I approached her to ask for name so that her good service could be acknowledged. Ambience The ambience was simple elegant which had once seen more glamorous days . However , it is still a classy place . We were seated at a quiet couch corner which I appreciated so much . Value The Afternoon Tea costs $33 ++ per pax from 2pm to 5pm daily . With the Entertainer 1-for-1 app , it costs about $20 per pax which is a sincere and genuine deal .

...can be good - breakfast also interesting , nice but too noisy place for me- food as expected in a cafeteria of a international hotel belonging to a world famouos chain

I've just had a very enjoyable dinner at Marriott Cafe this evening. The manager Mr Wayson was really welcoming and friendly when I walked in and he showed me to my seat while Miss Carol took care of the whole cafe section behind Java+ throughout the evening. Carol was really pleasant and she always acknowledge my requests and thanks with a nod and a genuine smile. She really works tirelessly the whole time but not once flustered with any of the diners despite being very busy. Used plates were cleared and water topped up very frequently without the need to ask at all!By far this was the most pleasant dining experience I had for the many times I had visited Marriott Cafe, please kindly convey my thanks and compliments to them. The team of service staff, especially Carol really made a difference this evening and enhanced the overall dining experience

Local High Tea.. Simple local food was severed. Which we can just purchase it our local coffee shop in Singapore. Didn't find it value for money $$. Service was not in standard as the waiters are not local n they don't speak or understand simple English. Handling of plates and utensils was not professional. The table settings were not in order. The standard is too low and not value for $
4
This is the first time i went to Marriott hotel for dinner buffet. I'm impressed by the food. It is fresh and delicious. I will bring my family there again very soon
4
The service was very friendly and prompt. My plates were cleared almost immediately after i'm done. It was a nice atmosphere and we sat there to chit chat. The tea does not come in teapots but we were given cups with the teabags. We were constantly filling it up with hot water. Considering the price of the high tea buffet, the food was so-so, nothing to shout about
5
Was there earlier this month and they were running a promotion - 1 for 1 for their Buffett breakfast which is otherwise over $40 per head.Selection was decent - I wouldn't go there without the promotional price as it's not quite worth the full price but it's a lovely place to people watch.Call ahead to check if promo is on - was only avail on weekday breakfasts when I was there.
1
I am a huge fan of the Pool Grill but high tea at the Marriot Cafe should be avoided at all cost! You may as well go to the wet market- same atmosphere.Food is mediocre and way too many tables squeezed into a huge area. The place is obviously popular with locals who want their money's worth by eating like there is no tomorrow. Plates loaded high with prawns. No manners, screaming kids , ughh
3
Good service but average food. Coffee and tea wasn't good. I would rather go for hot water. Staffs are attentive thoug
5
David & Myra have a very warm services, they are keep smile on their face．the food very fresh and more choice , I will be here again

Having my birthday celebration on 13/4/17 with my family. 1st would like to said, the review is over rated.very disappointed for the food. the food variety is very little and overall the food is very salty and not in standard.me n husband walk around few time but duno what to eat.my mum and 4 years old daughter can't take spicy food and raw food, end up they can only eat the salty hong kong noodle, roast salmon, duck, the non crispy roast pork and the poor variety shushi and soup noodle.roast beef is totally not tender, crispy roast pork is not crispy, the fresh oyster is very "slim", and the snow crab n lobster taste so so.the "Viexx " buffet is definitely better than this
4
been there several times, they provided really best and quality food, but i think i kind of get bored to it, seems like stick to one same place is not always fun, but guys, if you never been there give it a try, they wont fail you
2
Highlighted to staff on the leaking air conditional above our table. The staff replied 'it's like that!' So why did you give us the table when the staff is aware of the leaking issue
3
Not much choice, too few type of foods, not much variety.Far too much sweet stuffs, such as cakes and sweet desserts.Only 3 types of sea foods served. I expected al least, there will be crabs,seaweedstuffs , cuttlerfish, etc....
5
I have been Marriott Café for many years only now then I write this review.Especially the beef short ribs yesterday. The meat was very soft and fall-out-of-the-bone type. Basically they never fail in their food quality and variety. Service is good as before. With the Amex platinum card privilege it is even better!Keep up with the good work.
5
Been there twice with Friend and colleague..no crowd and nice place to have gathering.Staff is friendly to
5
This is a most memorable evening with 5 other friends for my birthday. I was at first a little worried and apprehensive because my usual chefs are either on leave or on other shift. We were very well looked after especially by chief chef Christian from Italy, senior chef Kenny and waiter Mogan. My guests from Toronto and the Philippines were most impressed by the services rendered. Well done and keep up the good work. Nothing could be better than being looked after well on a special occasion. As it is we have already made our next reservation for 8 on the 21 of this month..Thanks
5
Came on a POSB one for one. The service was impeccable, the range was amazing. Oysters, thick slabs of salmon and tuna sashimi, and great desserts. The staff was always on hand to clear your plates, offer you a drink, all with a smile. A real highlight!
4
Food quality was OK, and no dish was badly done, but nothing was really special either. Staff are really helpful though
5
Staff are friendly providing excellent services especially Carol. She always carry a smile with her despite of numerous request from us
4
I was there for my friend's birthday, food was good but lack of variety. But staff was kind enough to provide us a slice of cake for the birthday girl (
4
Cold crab legs and pork saddle were excellent. Was surprised to see cockscomb for the first time.A good selection of desserts but taste-wise was so-so. Overall, worth a visit during 1 for 1 promotion
5
Very attentive and willing to go to the extra miles by staff She Hui. Though ice cream counter for Hi Tea had closed, she had taken the initiative to get a cup from kitchen for our table. Small action but sure brighten our day. Well done and congrats to the management for having such a staff. Thank you
4
Good Gathering's venue for classmates to sit down, chat and enjoy buffets of foods. In addittion, being a member of Club Marriott, also entitled to 50% (Certificate) off food prices. A good and big varieties of foods be it Asian, Western, seafoods, etc which you name it, they have it. Not forgetting the delicious pastries, confectionery and ice creams. Credit must also given to deserving and service oriented staff who were helpul, attentive to details and served with passion and smiles. They are counter staff Marai, She Hui and Chef Nino but the stars of the evening should be : 1. Chef Philip Lee who went the extra mile and patiently introduced the foods which I benefitted. 2. Server Vicky who served my guests and me very well with his heartliy and signature smiles. 3. Kitchen Suresh who specially cooked my prawn noodles soup to the temperature that I preferred. What a wonderful evening dinner to enjoy the good foods with classmates together
5
Very friendly staff & smiley. There is a wide variety of food and fresh. This place even serve fresh oysters for hi tea. They even arranged a slice of cake to help celebrate birthday. So thoughtful of them
4
Lovely environment, good food and friendly, pleasant staff , especially one by the name MOGAN. Feels like he has been there for ages, for at least 15 years, I must say. He is always correct, professional and serviced minded. He makes one very welcome. A very calm person. You get ALWAYS the same fantastic service from him everytime you visit Marriott Cafe.Not forgetting to mention, all the staff there are very friendly
4
The service provided by the crew were excellent, I would like to compliment Ms She Hui for her wonderful service, she is very patient and meticulous
4
Nice ambience great food!!! Wide spread of different food. Not too expensive. Will visit them again
3
Food was ok. Some of the food was a bit too saltish (oyster egg) and the tau sau would have been better if it had not turned cold. Satay was tender & good. The last time I came the food was better.The Chinese receptionist was not very service oriented and unfriendly. But the waiters and waitress serving were more polite and has smiles on their face. However some of the waiters and waitress held the utensils in a inappropriate manner that my girlfriend was quite shocked at the way she held her cup of coffee with her whole palm over it. Still the cafe attracted a huge crowd & long queue even though we had made reservation. Hope through these sharing service could be improved and more positive attitude in staff and improve in food quality and temperature. And help readers to u have a clearer idea of situation. Location of cafe is good, convenient and central.
3
We went to try our first Hi Tea as we always go for lunch and dinner buffet. It was not bad for the spread. Definitely there are enough varieties for you to pick. In terms of quality, you will expect half and half. One thing would like to highlight is that Yogesh's service has been excellent.
5
We had a fantastic time. Top-notch service by Mr Yogesh. He was very attentive to our needs and helped make my dad's birthday celebration a special one. Premium fresh seafood and good spread
5
Really enjoyed the food there, there was a wide spread consisting of many dishes around the world. The desserts were excellent too, the cakes look really pretty and appetising, would definitely go back just for the desserts
1
Poor service recovery. Came down with food poisoning after consuming seafoods(specifically oysters) at your buffet area. Lodged a complained but service staff and team were not helpful at all. Very disappointing experience. Given it is a 5 star reputable hotel, I would have expected more
5
Special thanks to Helen Yang (Guest Service Executive, Lobby Lounge) to make the special arrangement to allow us to have a perfect place to host our guest from Taiwan. A friendly and observant lady, who notice that I’m pregnant and took the initiative to change my ice water to warm water. Moreover, it was an excellent dining experience for my guest & colleagues. The Buffet spread is extremely good especially the seafood section, great prawns, best oyster and generous serving of sashimi. Throughout the meal, is all and only praises of how fresh and good the food is. The best buffet we ever have. Thanks to Marriot Café for providing such a great experience for us. Best Regards, Grace Lian 3/16
5
First time to try Marriott Cafe with my mom and brother, last Month for dinner. We are so happy with the variety of their food especially their service. Marriott Cafe is worth a try even though it's a little bit pricey. The place is well cleaned and staff were really accommodating! I especially loved their fresh seafood and the wide array of dessert choices (Well, everything here were really delicious) My family leaves the place really full and contented. More power to Marriott Cafe.. Will surely comeback when I visit Singapore again..PS: Missing your cheesecakes alread
5
 Best seafood in the town!! Good gathering with my friends. Appreciate to the service staff. Thank you for chai Lee's service too. He had been check back our table more than 5times when we are having our dinner. We will be back very soon.th
4
I liked this place a lot Nice feeling, relaxing and great coffee. Of course great service, very tranquil place in the heart of Singapore . I spent a good few hours resting here with coffee and snacks
4
It's a very cozy place in the street that you can watch many people passing by. Personally I prefer it for lunch and when I am going there I order the burger which is very good. Service is always goo
5
The food here is consistently of good quality and the ambience is fine. The dessert menu is very well thought-out and is always of high quality. I like how Marriott serves both Western and local cuisine and seafood, and always manages to produce menus of exceptional quality. The service here is pleasant also, albeit varied. Personally, I have received the best service from Chai Lee, who is always and enthusiastic. He is also very responsible and clearly takes pride in his work in Marriott Cafe. During the more than five times I have seen Chai Lee, he has never failed to make our meal away Marriott Cafe a pleasant experience. I will come back to Marriott Cafe because of the welcoming yet almost casual atmosphere here.
5
I've eaten here many times and it's always a great experience. I hadn't been for the past few months, we decided to have Sunday lunch here today and I'm happy to report that it's still great! I particularly enjoyed the mozzarella bar, roast beef and lamb.
4
Food looks good, seafood is fresh, tasty nice. But not much variety, especially for Japanese food..
5
Kudos to the staffof Marriott Cafe esp to Nick, Myra and Chef Tan for the warm welcome and friendly & one of a kind service provided to us. Food was also amazing and this is the only hotel buffet "High Afternoon Tea" that serves the widest food variety compared to other hotels. The crepe was so yummy, prawns, sushi, sashimi, date pudding, chix rice, salads, raisin scones, nachos and a lot more!!!!! This is so worth value for the money! They even gave us complimentary slice of cake for my friend's bday! Awesome treats from Marriott Hotel
5
We were in Singapore for a business trip staying at the Marriott, as well as hosting a two day class there. Each day during the class we took all 30 attendees to the Marriott Cafe Buffet for lunch. The Marriott had reserved specific tables for us. The choices were extremely plentiful and high quality, the food delicious, and the service was excellent. It is on the ground floor of the hotel, opposite the reception area
4
Tasty food and good service. Only seafood on ice, it would be better if have some hot cooked seafood
5
Had my long-awaited visit to Marriott Cafe and i've got to say the service is really excellent, from the hostess, to the staff to the chef! Absolutely love the service by the chef at the omelette station, he entertains with his cooking and is really polite and friendly. Not to forget a staff by the name of Liz, she is definitely courteous and looks so willing to help. Had an excellent meal thanks to the really top-notch service by everyone!As for the food, i have to say i enjoyed everything I ate. The omelette and scrambled eggs were my personal favourites and i love how "international" the spread was, whereby i get to have different food items of different cuisines.Overall a very enjoyable experience as i love both the food and the service. It wasn't noisy as well for a weekend breakfast and was seated immediately when i arrived at 9+am, which was really great. Will definitely love to be back
5
I brought my wife for her birthday lunch and we are happy with the food selections.The freshly chucked oysters and the sashimi is good. The roast beef is juicy and tender. Pasta and noodles with the roasted pork is a nice combination. We had a birthday song sang to my wife with a small cake complimentary of the cafe.Definitely will come back again soon.Simo
5
Today we went to Marriott for breakfast...very warm welcome and we had the choice of inside or outside seating. Drinks were prompt and attentive service. Great ham for westerner-loved it. Then strawberry, blueberries, we had Dim sum, local food, Indian, etc. The chefs were helpful and friendly...like the smile on the faces. Thank you for a wonderful morning
4
Good variety of dishes from sashimi and oysters to Asian and International Also has a decent roast sectionDesserts are good to
5
All the Seafoods were fresh and my spouse super satisfied with the foods. However waitress did not ask whether they can clear the plate and just take it away in front of us. There was still a fresh oyster on the plate. And Valentine dinner that i ordered was inclusive free flow sparkling wine. The waitress did not check properly and ask me if i would like to top up money for free flow wine.  Ambience acceptable as our table consider quiet. No one disturb beside. Happy with our seats. Overall, I am quite satisfied with the Valentine Day Dinner. Will come again in future. Thank you very much
5
Quality of food is good. Variety of food is good for the celebration. Service is good. Will recommend to friends.
4
Average buffet, no wow factor. The service staff is good for their service. The food was above average. The cold seafood variety not much. The oysters was too small.
4
A variety of local fruit, wonderful pastries and bread, smoothies using local and well known fruits, enjoyed the omelet and noodle station. Awesome service by wait help. It was a bit chilly for me and the staff offered me one of their shawls to use. Very considerate and friendl
4
Very good spread. Value for money. Conducive for big family groups. Staff very attentive. Overall, a very good experience
4
There are lots of seafood choices here, both fresh and cooked versions. I had too much of a choice trying to pick what to eat. The quality was good enough and I am sure most can fill their tummy just by trying every item. The dessert platter was also plentiful for anyone with a sweet tooth.
5
My wife and I visited this Restaurant the 2nd time today for Breakfast. A great place to enjoy very decent food provided in a comfortable environment. Service:very efficient and super friendly. Swift with a professional approach in ensuring that guests and empty dishes are well taken care of. Food: My wife enjoyed the Classic American a la Carte eggs, with toasted bagels ( 4 1/2 pieces), Nice! My daughter and I went for the Buffet and like a couple of weeks ago, an elaborate spread of sumptuous dishes awaits you. Although it was very busy, tables are not cramped next to each other, to give you a bit of privacy. Big bowls of ripe blueberries, strawberries and other delightful fresh cut fruits to start with, can give a bit the feeling, of indulgence. A comprehensive continental - Antipasti selection, doesn't leave much room for anything yu might miss out. The Chef in charge is coming to slice the next load of Prosciutto ham.Well displayed pastries and breads, good hot food selection, noodles to order, juices, all in easy reach. There is something for everyone.I had asked our waitress for some GF bread, which came toasted, warm and with a smile.We should be back, with more to discover in future.Well Done Marriott Team, you have a new Fan :-
5
Visited this restaurant to celebrate my bff's birthday. The buffet spread was good and the service of the staff was great, save for 2 flies that kept hovering around us/our table. Informed the restaurant that i would like to celebrate my bff's bday and they were kind enough to present her with a cake that is chocolate and caffeine free as per my request, as my bff is sensitive to chocolate and caffeine. The staff actually went the extra mile to fulfill my request! Will come again
5
outside watching the comings and goings of central sg or inside in the zircon, up to you.prices as to be expected in Singapore and from Marriott , but excellent selection, service all up to par and crazy delicious laks
4
Marriot high tea offers a good range of food choices. However, I was quite disappointed that they actually gave my toddler girl a set of cutlery which appeared to be oily and dirty - as if the plates had been used before. Not something I thought will happen in Marriott
4
A good place to have your buffet with different variety of food and drink. The service is good as well.
5
More than well located, this place is ideal to have a buffet dinner. Their choice is enormous and quality excellent (at a price which is OK for Singapore...). I try to do this every time I come to SIN
5
Their buffet has a good variety of food and the raw seafood is really fresh. Service is excellent as I was there for a special occasion and they actually provided a complementary cake with words written on the plate
4
We had breakfast at the Marriott Cafe and the food available was a pleasant surprise in terms of the range and quality and far better than most hotel cafes.The service was good as well and all a pleasant surprise
2
We came here for weekend dinner buffet. The seafood was ok, but we just took 1-2 oysters as they were not fresh. The options of sashimi was too little. The portion of salmon cut was too small as it would affect the textures. The hot item and desserts were good tho. However the worst part was the staff at the meat section! He displayed his piss off attitude and looked like he didn't bother to serve us. After I ordered the roasted beef from him, I handed my plate over to him held the plate for about 30 secs. He never tried to catch the plate or say a word. His attitude to my friend was even worse. When she ordered roasted beef from this staff, he unexpectedly threw the meat on the floor and gravy all around! Then he still didn't say anything, no sorry, just gave her another piece with a nasty face like it was my friend did something wrong! Unbelievable..
3
Went for their high tea buffet. Mostly carb stuff, scones, sandwiches etc, with local dishes like rendang, fried kway tiao, chicken rice etc. Place is packed, but the chefs replenished the food quite swiftly. Only seafood item is poached prawns. Not really worth it imo. I will prefer if they included more main course dishes n more varieties of tea. Service is good
5
Sat outside- Group of 4.Ordered a starter each... Prawn cocktail- incredible - good size prawns - so fresh Calamari- fantastic Tom yum soup- one with prawns, other with chicken - without question the best Tom yum soup ever had !! Perfect spice etc.Mains- two shared the spag Bol.. and other two shared the wagyu burger with fries. And a side of chicken wings to share with hot sauce..Great service, great atmosphere, and most importantly great service - we will be back next time in town
3
As usual read the review in the straits time $63 buffet sound reasonable in the heart of orchard road.When there for lunch selection is poor for $63 . The only item worth is the raw oyster and sashimi. The rest very ordinary but some food taste was good, like the bread pudding, lasagna, the cake. There was no kueh in the selection.The guy that serve the meat section was rather not helpful when you tell him the beef is too raw. Ask the cook to fry for you his reply.attitude problem in the service industry.The food label was good very clear easy to read.Payment, they have a promotion with amex 1 for 1. But they charge you the ++ on the total of $126 first than less the discount so u actually pay a few dollars more. I wonder if this is the correct way of 1 for 1. Simple lay man will think $126 divide by 2 ++ but that's not what marriott cafe charge.Will not ho back again
5
The Christmas feel of the hotel made the eating experience memorable, the stand out feature of this buffet was the generous servings and assortment covering each palate and fancy. Cray fish, baked Salmon, prawns, carved roasts and salads with lashings of delectable toppings to choose. Smart quick service and comfortable calming decor made this a ++Dining experience! Will make a return soon
4
My second time dining at the Marriott cafe for Xmas events this year. Both lunch and dinner were amazing. Thoroughly pleased with the food selection and service! Seafood was fresh and absolutely delicious! Desserts were to die for - sticky date pudding with vanilla sauce was my personal favourite. Managed to get the names of the staff who had served us during the dinner service, big thanks to Myra, Kiko, Amintra and Chef Nino!
5
Myra - she was the crew who made sure our dinner went smoothly as ever. Amintra- another crew who cleaned the table every now and then because we ate all seafood like there's no tomorrowChef Niño- how I loved how he did the grilled crab claws ,baked oysters and lobsterKiko- well he ensured that we're well fed with the desserts. Maro- assisted us all throughout the dinner too and made sure everyone went home happy.
5
Good service from the staff and food quality was good, especially the tuna prawns and carbonara pasta.
5
Just went to the Marriott for high tea today. The food was great. Lots and lots of food to choose from. We didn't but would probably be easier to make a reservation.
5
Had an all-girls Christmas Party dinner & drinks here. Loved the buffet & wine selection! Thank you specially to CHEF Nino for the amaaazing baked mussels (to die for!) The staff are warm and accommodating, we took note of their names cause they made sure we were taken cared of the whole night: Myra & Kiko! Thank you, definitely a Christmas Party to remember <
5
Myra is the best waitress in cafe Marriott in Orchard. . She assisted us to make sure we are having a good fun and good food for our Christmas party for 2016 . . Will eat here agai
2
We frequent this for breakfast on a regular basis particularly when we have visiting friends or family birthdays. Have always enjoyed it but today was very different. I had ordered eggs Benedict and look what I was given. I commented to the Chef that this was the worst eggs Benedict I had ever seen. He took offence but you be the judge. Look at the photo! Sorry I can't tell you if it tasted as bad as it looked as I didn't eat it. Soggy toast. The service was also not at its best No glasses for the juice. They offer a smoothie but you need lots of patience for the 15 minute wait. The bacon tray was empty and they usually have a leg ham carvery but not today
4
Had buffet lunch on Saturday afternoon. Starts from 12pm to 2.30pm. In the month of December, you can expect some Christmas selections like roast turkey.Overall I'm happy with the food quality, the prawns, fresh oyster and sashimi tuna and salmon are very fresh. Roast beef and turkey were pretty good too. Other selections include a noodle station, pasta station, salad bar, cold appetizers, fruits and desserts. They have an ice cream bar with 5 different flavors and some hot food.It's my 3rd visit to this buffet over a pretty long period of time and I'm hoping there can be more variety in the dishes.They may have some credit card promotions. Check with the staff when you call for reservation
3
I had a buffet dinner at the Marriot Cafe on Thursday evening. The cost per adult for weekday dinner buffet was $80++ based on festive price as it was in December. I felt that it was not worth the price as the quality of the food was nothing fantastic. There was only roast turkey but no honey baked ham. Also there was no Christmas log cake. My family and myself were quite disappointed with the dinner at that price.
5
Went back to the Mariott Cafe after a long time without visiting Singapore. Food & drinks here are general great. Steaks are always a good choice here. However, i like a special dish here, that is BBQ Rack of Lamp Salad. My mouth watering everytime i thought of it. I have already tried most of dishes here ( i used to lived here before) but the dish i like the most is BBQ Rack of Lamp Salad ( not in the menu but i always asked the chef to make it special for me). A bit pricy here, but still affordable. I think, you should try this dish here if you have a chance to visit this place. You will remember forever!!! So YUMM
5
Had breakfast here on few occasions whilst staying at The Marriott. The food and the selection of food was great. You could go there for breakfast for a month and not end up tasting everything on offer. They must cater to everyone's tastes. The staff are very friendly and attentive. Eden at the fruit juice station was always happy to assist even with unusual juice requests.
5
Went yesterday for High Tea, lovely experience, service great, staff friendly, they spoke to all of us in our party of 4 and made us feel very welcome. Hugh selection of food, something for everyone. We arrived at 3pm and did not have a reservation and with hindsight we should have one, but we where able to go straight in, no waiting. We have been here before over the years and will be coming again when we are next in Singapore.High tea is aways a part of our holiday and this was an enjoyable experience
5
Great meeting place at corner of Orchard and Scotts Road. Service is great and fantastic to watch the world go buy with a cold beer and Nadia Goreng. Free wifi and great snack menu with good mix of Asian and Western dishes.
4
The buffet here is very good. The variety of food is there. Very fresh and service is superb. Keep it going!!!
4
I never been a fan of buffets..but i end up beeing invited at the Marriot and i really enjoyed my afternoon. Superb sea food, especially oysters.
It is a value for money high tea.
5
Their high tea is worth the price! They serve fresh oyster, prawns and wide spread of food. Good discount given if using specific credit cards!
1
High tea menu is not at all impressive. Spread is miserable in every section, food quality is unexpectedly poor. The cafe will lose its location appeal if it does not re-invent itself
4
The main downside of buffets is the overcooking of food in buffet spread. Marriott Cafe overcame this downside by cooking smaller quantities for buffet spread and then re-cooking a fresh lot for refill. This keeps the food from being overcooked - Applause. Always enjoy the oysters - hence the price is steeper but it is worth it if you like oysters freshly shucked.

I always stay at the Marriott when in Singapore and usually eat at the Crossroads buffet a couple of times. Had dinner there on a Sunday night.It was poor. The buffet had that "tired look" that comes from a lack of tidying it up and replenishing it, and the food was overcooked, left out too long, and generally tasteless. Really disappointing since this is normally a good place. Might have been an off night

Decent - not great - buffet; a la carte portions are pretty generous. For quality of food, you can do better at other hotels in the Orchard Road area (eg. Four Seasons, Grand Hyatt). Friendly service staff, although many could be a bit clueless at times. The seating near the entrance doesn't offer any privacy or ambiance. So, you would legitimately ask, why bother coming here at all? Perhaps the fantastic location at the Orchard and Scotts Road intersection

Good food. I like the noodle station where you get to mix what you like. I also like the cold dish and dessert section. A good place for friends catch up. Just a little too hot if you seat near the entrance/exit. Can't feel the aircon

Was here for a company course/training and we had our lunch here. I think the buffet spread has lots of variety and d seafood section is soo fresh. Fresh seafood options awaits ur palates-- Freshly Shucked Oysters; Prawns; Crayfish; Snow Crab Legs, Whole Baked Fish of the Day, all glorious! Sushi spread was not that much tho'...thankfully there's my fave salmon and tuna sashimi! Was disappointed not to find a pasta spread except for lasagne. There's a station for a nice bowl of laksa noodle.. Quite a variety of mouth-watering deserts to choose from. At SGD39++ for lunch...I'd say its a value for money
5
Had a lunch buffet few days ago. Food spread is good, with great variety of desserts as well. A little crowded probably because of banks'promotions. Service of staffs was proactive. Well recommended. Should have free parking for patrons.

Thank you for the lovely cake to celebrate my friend's birthday. Appreciate that we accommodate our request for a quiet corner to enjoy the delicious food. Great service.

I visited this cafe with my family to try out their hi tea. It was a good choice. I like the atmosphere - not too crowded, food selection are placed such that it is not too crowded, and the chefs are nearby to attend to you.There's a mix of Asian and Western food. You have sushi, sashimi, bak kuh teh, herbal chicken soup, chicken rice, roti prata, satay, fried chicken wings, some dim sum, and nasi lemak. For Western, you have pizza, scones, fish and chips, roast meat, salads, muffins and more. And there are many desserts for you to choose too!One thing I would appreciate is the servers telling customers what drinks they can choose. I was only offered warm water, but we could actually request for coffee and tea as well. Another thing I would appreciate is probably having the dining tables spaced out a bit more. There isn't much room between chairs of opposing tables where I was seated. It's not a big problem, but I think the dining experience would have been better.All in, worth it when it's on promotion. I went for the 2 for $50 promo. If it's more, I may reconsider since there are other options too

highlights: - great laksa, fresh prawns and sticky date pudding- good friendly service. Staff promptly removed dirty plates- twg tea included in buffetletdowns: - $10 for a can of coke at the buffet! Staff warn that it is charged, but not the shocking price- thoroughly grey, overcooked roast beef without even a hint of pink. According to the carver: "Singaporeans like it well done". Nonsense

Today, in order to shelter from the rain my husband and I ordered two coffees from a cafe at Orchard did not know it was part of the Marriott chain. We were shocked to discover the cost for our two small black coffees were $23. I suppose about £14. We have never paid as much as that even in St Marks Square in Venice
5
we were served very fast without much waiting and the food so tasty and fresh. the chilli crab is normal and a little salty on the night we went. the other tuna, oyster, prawn and big crab legs are fresh and taste yummy. we finished dinner and want to chill a bit more and was offered compliemtatry camomile tea as extra since it was our special ocassion and i would love to note down their names of staffs who attended to us but forgot, It was a very enjoyable dinner that created happy memories where other cafe may not have for buffet. recommeded for food and servic
5
Overall food is above average. Nice hot soup is my favourate. The thing that make me most satisfied is the service mind of staff name "Ajay". First day; I order a pure carrot juice and for the rest of my days staying here. If he is there, he recognises me and ask if I need carrot juice. I notice you have good trainning system. But Ajay is natural comparing with others. Great people you have here
5
Its our last day in SG, my friend and I cant decide which place we can have a good breakfast and while walking in Orchard we saw this very nice place Marriott Cafe. And guess what?! We made the right choice! We had a great breakfast with unexpected excellent service!, KUDOS TO MR. Anton, Vic and Most of all to Ms. Maria...keep up the excellent service
5
I was very disappointed on a staff by the name of Shen Ai who attended to me for the table reservation. As she have a bad attitude while she was attending to me. I am a loyalty member with Marriott but I never have such experienced before. However, I wish to compliment Mogan and Chef Daniel at Marriott Cafe on their excellent service. They have a very personal touch attitude. Kudos to them and keep it up
5
Celebrated a friend's birthday with friends at the marriott. A most memorable evening. The attention one gets is impeccable. I used to rely on certain chefs for good service but it seems all the chefs are equally commendable. Chefs like kelvin and Kenny and kristian all offer their kind assistance in any way possible. I am sure this is part of the marriott culture. Well done. Keep up the good work
4
Great spot at the bar to enjoy people watching & happy hour cocktails, make sure you're there between 3-6 (otherwise bring your credit card - its a Singapore thing not the hotel chain - drinking is expensive).

Overall the food is good but the crayfish and crab leg can be preserve to the freshness.The oilo oilo for the pasta section not very nicely done. Waiter and Waitress are well trained and polit

Service is good, attentive. Siting area not spacious. Variety of Food is limited.Quality of food, average

We went there using our 1-1 offer. It was a good deal. excellent seafood like prawns and sashimi, but the oysters will slightly bitter. The remiander of the food was good, the ice cream in particular is fantastic
5
Visited Marriot Cafe. This is my second time there. The waiter Mr Chai and Mr DAvid, the manager, left a deep impression. 1) I have a particular preference for freshly shucked oysters. knowing this, Mr Chai helped me specially arrange with the resto chef to look into whether I could have some, as i was a second time customer2) Secondly, Mr DAvid came by to speak with my guest and I, giving us much appreciated sense of welcome. It made us very happyThe food is well prepared. Specifically, i enjoyed the wide range of food, and the atmosphere of the cafeThe excellent geographical location of the hotel also made visiting them easy. It's a great PlaceBotak Trevor.

In the last two months, I had to organize dinners for friends from overseas and birthday functions for friends, and the only choice for me was Marriott Cafe. The reason was simple - the food is good and the service standards are high. Crew members Mogan and Chai Lee (etc), and Chef Daniele and Chef Nino (etc) gave me confidence that all my friends who dined there would not be disappointed and they weren't! Thanks to Mogan, Chai Lee and the Chefs for making our social functions so successful. Every single friend who dined there left completely satisfied
5
Only when you love food, and they will love you back, and so that every bite will delight your taste buds ambiguously.Note: Specially thanks to Miss Vic who is very friendly and sincerely expressed the enthusiasm in assisting diners to enjoy the meals. Thanks once again Miss Vic!With regards from Andy Le

Is a treat for my friend for my birthday. If I am not wrong it cost $80+++ for a Friday nite dinner. My frez has a 1 for 1 promo so we went. Cleanliness I would say 10 points. The staff took the trouble to change the tongs/spoon for each dishes after awhile. U kn lah some customers just love to drip some remaining around the buffet. So this act really neaten the whole buffet area. Food choice they have lobsters, oyster, crayfish etc for cold dishes. Lobster to b honest really "chewy" n "frozen". I am glad when I feedback to one of the chef, I remembered his name, RAJ, he immediate offer to grill the lobsters for me to so call heat up. Wonderful act. I still worried other customers would request this special gestures so when received the hot lobster I sneaky n quickly walk to my seat. Then I went to thank him... Surprisingly he told me if anyone request he will always be willing to help. What a wonderful staff... Who cares anymore if the food is yummy. Haha...Well, I still need comment on the choices of food... Marriott cafe is not big so choices not a lot but they cover all nationals. They have chilli crabs, sorry this is disappointing, Malaysia curry chicken, taste nice but not a curry to me, pasta, soup, grill food area and etc. I am a sweet tooth person... Looking forward to desert, sorry to say abit disappointed but ice cream is nice. Well, if is a promo n frez suggest there, I dun mind to revisit. But for me to pay that amount I will rather choose another venue. Sorrie.

If you like fresh cold prawns and smoked salmon then uou should really go for it. Thr rest of dishes is not fantastic

Great location on Orchard and Scotts Road.Easy access via subway etc.The outside tables are great and the staff is right on point.The food is good , not great. Just a great place to meet and have a meeting without being indoors.Great to people watch. Overall I enjoyed this location for lunch.They usually have specials posted on the wal

Went there for a family dinner and to celebrate a birthday. Was pleasantly surprised at the wide spread of local and international foods on the buffet. The service were all very attentive and helpful. The captain on duty, Mr W Lai went out of the way to get us a 'doggie bag' when he saw us saving the wonderful left over bones for our...... dogs. He even went out of his way to the kitchen to find large leftover bones for us, a great show of thoughtfulness for his customers. To end off, the already wonderful time, we had a 20% off the final bill...can't ask for more

Not my 1st time with marriott cafe. We used to frequent the place years back. Sadly, yesterday's visit didn't keep up to our expectations. We arrived at 4pm for high tea and as usual, the cafe was full of guests. I glanced through the pastries 1st but nothing really caught my attention. Didn't even see scones. So I had the laksa and immediately got disappointed with the 1st spoon. It was flat and tasteless. I quickly told one of the trainees attending to our section but it seems that my message was not going through. I wanted to give a chance, probably they forgot to put something but I got a "hanging look". Anyway, I moved on to try the nasi lemak and was expecting that the fragrant rice and sambal will save the day...but it didn't. And it was the same for the curry chicken and briyani. In our section we had 2 staff and on their name tags - trainees. I felt their willingness to serve but somehow there was a missing link with the communication part. And they had difficulty trying to attend to all the guests. Sad...it's not the same
4
There was good variety of food at hi-tea. The deep fried stingray and sticky date pudding are excellent! Taste of dim sum items are only so-so
4
I called to make a reservation for a buffet dinner on 25 Aug 2016. The operator wasn't that friendly and just told us the place was full. Happen that we were round the corner so we walked in to ask for a table for 2. The cafe manager, David, was very obliging and he helped fix us a table for 2 by sitting outside of the cafe without air con. We accepted it.While we were having our dinner, one of the waiter by the name Krishnan, served our table. We were very impressed with his service. He is very attentive in his job and serve us well.Last but not least, we would like to give our compliments to the restaurant manager, David, and the waiter, Krishnan, which brings up the name of the restaurant and gives a very good image
5
From the beef tenderloin sandwich, to the laksa, to the curry, the food here is always remarkable. Sure the local dishes are more expensive than compared to your hawker type fare. However, the portions are larger and the quality is excellent. Plus, you can enjoy 2 for 1 cocktails all week long! Cheers! (Thanks MJ for a great Singapore sling!

Quite honestly, I wasn't going to write another review for this café. However, what caught my attention was the comments of a recent review. Being in the PR/HR industry, I felt the need to give my two cents worth.There is a difference between a healthy review and a lengthy post about one particular employee who was even identified in the title of the review for no other reason but to name and shame her and, dare I say, get the poor girl terminated (impression I got from the opening sentence). Now, if I were treated in the same manner as was claimed by the reviewer, I would send my complaint directly to the hotel (it does have an official website and contact after all). It is more effective and believe me, you will get personal attention and more satisfaction going through this channel.On the other hand, naming and shaming employees of a business on review sites is poor social etiquette and reflects badly, more on the reviewer than on the employee.I do not know She Hui personally, but she has attended to me before on one of my regular visits to the Marriot Café and I have had no complaints of her work, or that of any of the service staff there. One of the main reasons why I frequent this café whenever I'm in Singapore
3
I have been thinking for a week if I should write to express my severe disappointment but decided to do so as I feel that She Hui is not suitable to work as a service staff. We may have our bad days but we are all working professionals. Bringing your mood to the working place is not right.On 12 August, It is my husband's birthday and I have made a reservation in Marriott cafe as we always go there for Buffet Lunch or Hi tea.On that day it was very crowded as I understand there is 1 for 1 Hi tea. We were initially seated near the sofa seat with long table but as the air con was leaking, we request to move to the round table and was serviced by a very rude and inefficient waitress She Hui.She only needs to attend to a few tables but there were no smile at all and she never keep our plates until I always have to signal other service staff to do it. I ask for water for my kids for twice and was not given and When I ask her again saying that I ask for it twice. I was shocked by a extremely rude, angry and impatient voice "Just a moment". She is raising her voice and my family were looking at each other unbelievable and I went to complain to Beeyleen, the manager.I believe Beeyleen spoke to her and She Hui even purposely walked over and gave me and my whole family a stare. I cant believe a five star hotel could have trained such a service staff. So I feedback to Beeyleen again. Even though Beeyleen the manager and other service staff tried their best to compensate and did a wonderful job to service us but this had totally spolit my day

Thank you to Mr Simon Bell and the team for helping to make Maddisons 7th Birthday so much funChef Daniel and team welcomed us back and even brought a cake .... Not just a cake .... But an amazing chocolate cake to celebrate for breakfast :)

Family of 4 (3 adults & 1 child) went for high tea buffet on a Thursday afternoon at Marriott cafe. The service wise is generally ok as what you would expect from normal restaurant, however food wise is not very good in my opinion. The sushi bar did not have a wide variety and the roll was not properly wrapped. The dim sum "har kau" skin was thick and could not really taste any shrimp taste in it. The dim sum variety was also limited. The laksa also not very appealing in taste. Basically, in my humble opinion, with that price, it would be good if you choose to dine at either a proper Japanese restaurant, dim sum restaurant or if you fancy hawker fare; then you should perhaps have better value for money and better quality food
5
The food here is really good, the service here is over the top too. Its a strong recomendation for people who are looking for a place to sit and chill in the middle of a hot sunny day other than going to a beach. Love it here
5
M.J looked after me superbly as usual ..... A very relaxing evening and everything excellent...thank you !
5
They offer a very nice buffet style meal, american, malay, chinese and even european. The setup is very nice, where on the Asian side, you can make your own Miso soup, noodle soup, or Pick up your Dim Sum. On the other sides you can get fruit, hot cakes, eggs (your pick), hash browns, bread, a selection of cheese, smoked salmon, etc
5
A few friends and I decided to get together and celebrate our friendship. Our natural choice was of course Marriott Cafe (high tea on Saturday); we were unanimous. The high tea was fabulous. There was an excellent mix of Western (e.g. smoked salmon, fresh oyster) and Asian (e.g. dim sum, satay) and we were spoiled for choice. The service was also exceptionally good. We would like to thank Chai Lee and MoGan for giving us all the attention we needed. It was sheer delight dining at Marriott Cafe
4
Went here simply to have the REAL back Bacon they serve on the Buffet. Whilst the Breakfast Buffet price is a little steep at almost S$50 per head the availability of excellent back bacon and up to 11am all you can eat and drink (coffee and tea and juices) it was still worth it
2
My wife wanted to eat hi tea so we reserved a table for 2 on Saturday. From first glance, the selection of food looks good. However, when we started to eat, everything doesn't taste good. It's like they do not have good recipes for any of the dishes they served. The laksa was mediocre, so many other hotel buffets have better laksa than Marriott, the carrot cake, chicken rice, fried kway teow tasted bland. The durian desserts totally tasted of essence without the taste of the real food. Chicken wings tasted bland. I wont say the food sucks, but I would say nothing tasted good. BTW, they have one of the worst tasting ice cream I've ever eaten. The only good thing was their tiger prawns on ice, at least those tasted fresh
2
My children wanted afternoon tea so we stopped in. The food tasted good but the quiche made me ill just after eating. Perhaps the eggs had gone bad. The service was not the best but not awful- somewhat inattentive and slow. I couldn't get smaller bills from the server to leave additional gratuity (while paying with cash.) He sent me to wait in line at the front desk. :
3
My first time at the restaurant and decided to eat there and expecting crabs but none! I did paid the full price of $78.00 ++ for two persons and there was no crab on 28 Jul 16. But it was on the advertisement .... The waitress asked me to call next time and ask..if it is durian I understand but crabs is not seasonal. I am expecting too much or you are not fair to me.Although I am very disappointed but my Wife like the salmon and laksa
4
Buffets are usually expensive nowadays. This is no exception. The one for one credit card promotion makes this worth a try. Food selection is quite ok. Love the ginseng chicken soup. Tea and coffee including cappuccino and latte included. Even have "art" on the cappuccino. Lovely.
5
This restaurant is truly excellent. Buffet options offer a fabulous variety of dishes. Seafood is a particular highlight with excellent sushi, sashimi, oysters and lobster. If you're the sort of person who likes to devour one hundred oysters in one go then you're in the right place!Great variety but with consistent quality is the hallmark of this restaurant. The ambience and service are also excellent. Chef Daniele, Nino, Mogan, Chailee and Myra came to our attention as being particularly excellent.Keep up the good work guys!For a world class dining experience, you can't do better

Had buffet breakfast during my 3 day stay here. As compared to a few other places I found the Vegetarian options quite limited. Also found a dead fly in my strawberry milk
5
Food - 4.5 starsI went for dinner buffet and their seafood spread is bounty - if you love seafood and have a craving, this is the place to go. The pasta station is quite normal but seeing the chef to actually prepare you the food gives a theatre plus. Very attentive and funny chef. Sad, I didnt catch his name.The asian cuisines are straight forward. Not really my expertise to comment but it was flavorful nonetheless.Dessert is a standard spread of a 5-star calibre. Save room for it. You won't regret it.Ambience - 4 starsIt's not a Michelìn star fine dining atmosphere. There's a lot of people, the space is a bit cramped and obviously the purpose of the restaurant is to give quality buffet to the highest number of people as possible. It didn't go out and wowed me. But I wasnt uncomfortable though. Service - 5 starsFrom the hostess to the efficient and attentive waiter, it was wonderful through the night. My glass never went empty and the used plates were cleared quickly. My friends and I asked a lot of favors but Kiko promptly did all of it and always with a warm smile. Even the management checks up on you from time to time to make sure you are taken care of. It seems most of the staff has a positive attitude through the night.Worth of money - 5 starsDefinitely worth it. Just make sure, you try and sample everything.Overall:Good food, excellent servic

Went there on a Sunday for lunch. The spread was good. Oysters, lobsters, prawns and salmon were replenished often and thus you won't have to wait. Dessert spread was ok. Would prefer for them to pre cut the cakes so it won't be messy and the counter. Ice cream were not very frozen and so by the time you get to your table, they would have started to melt. The cooked food section was ok, nothing to jump up and down for. Coffee and tea served are just the regular ones. Not specialty teas or coffees. It's quite pricey if there isn't a promotion. Staffs were very friendly and they cleared your plates very quickly. So no piling up. 2016 Buffet PricingBreakfast BuffetMonday to Sunday:Adult $42++Child $19++ (Age: 5 to 12 years old)Lunch BuffetMonday to SaturdayAdult $59++Child $35++ (Age: 5 to 12 years old)Sunday Lunch BuffetAdult $75++* / $98++**Child $46++ (Age: 5 to 12 years old)*Inclusive of free flow of soft drinks & juices**Inclusive of free flow of sparkling wine, beer & soft drinksHigh Tea BuffetMonday to Friday / Saturday & Sunday:Adult $42++ / $45++Child $25++ / $28++ (Age: 5 to 12 years old)Dinner BuffetSunday to Thursday / Friday & Saturday:Adult $70++ / $80++Child $38++ / $40++ (Age: 5 to 12 years old)Prices are subject to 10% service charge and 7% Goods and Services Tax (GST)

We had been to this cafe for a few times. For lunch buffet, dinner buffet and even reunion dinner. Their services are always great. Especially during the reunion dinner, we would preferred to dine here as it is more relax and quiet compare to traditional restaurant that need to time you for eating a proper reunion dinner. High tea is also one of our favourite cafe. Highly recommended
4
The ambience was great. The wide spread of food was delicious. Not forgetting the excellent service by the staffs, especially She Hui. However, the music was a little too loud for us to talk to each other over dinner.
4
Quick one.... Their signature burger Marriott burger was excellent... Very nicely done to my liking... My Guinness was a little disappointing though... Not the perfect pour that I am used to.. And wasn't as chilled as expected .. I will definitely come back for the Marriott burger .
4
had a good experience! We were served by Yayo and she is excellent. . . Memorable experience and good food! Seafood is so yum! . . . Location is fantastic! Will come back!

We went to this place after a long walk shopping an enjoying the bars along the Orchad road.very good experience and nice staff. Wifi was free and price was good.Thank yo
3
nothing special or to shout about, it is considered very ordinary buffet high tea. In fact, for the price paid for, it is not value for money. Service needed to be improve; sit at counter as was told no more table available. Water drip down from aircon. Request for change of sit, first service staff acknowledge but forget about it. Stand and waited for 5 min and requested 2nd time before arrangement been made
3
I have made reservation for 3 persons for high tea. There was a quite a long line for those who have made reservation. Obviously, this place was popular with the "one for one" promotion. But the wait was not long. We were seated fairly quickly. The staff was a bit inexperienced but friendly. She did not explain to us that we have a choice for the type of tea available. The food was adequate for a high tea. There was fresh prawns, station that cooked noodles and laksa, crepes with durian. There were both local food like satay, chicken rice, roti prata, rojak and ice kacang. If you want to stick to an english high tea, there were scones, cakes and sandwiches. The plates were cleared quickly from our table. We spent a pleasant afternoon here, even though the place was packed, it's still relatively quiet
5
We are very pleased with Vic and Akshay's excellent service as well as Marriott Cafe's sumptuous lunch. We are extremely satisfied with the service and food.
5
Taste is nice, a lot of sweet dessert- varieties of cakes, ice cream, bread and butter pudding, Kueh. Food like sashimi, prawns, crayfish, oysters, chef cook pasta when you order, roasted beef, etc
4
The spread is really great. The satay is good though it will be better if pork satay is included. The chicken rice is really fragrant. Dessert is nice with the inclusion of "durian corner". The Indian selection is delicious too. It is almost a full international spread. Eat a little bit of everything, though i didn't managed to have, is more than enough to combine lunch and dinner! Better still, look out for credit card's promo on 1-for-1. Bon appetit
3
Food are average here. Buffet is good value for money. Service is ok. Location is very good as you can have a drink and watch the world walk pass you. Recommended

I was at the Marriott Cafe recently for their weekday high tea buffet.The best thing about the afternoon was that I got a 50% discount on the bill, courtesy of a voucher from American Express, and oh I got a bargain on a frying pan at Tang's Department Store. SGD29 for a 24cm WMF stainless steel frying pan is fantastic!Other than that, I have to say everything else was rather ordinary. Food wise, it was a typical high tea spread, with fried noodle, chicken rice, some assorted dim sum items, pastries, rojak, laksa, etc. As I said, a very typical high tea spread, Singapore style. What was disappointing was the service. The waiters and waitresses were friendly enough, but I got the feeling that they were not very well trained. Speed seemed to be the priority, at the expense of etiquette and hygiene.There was always a few staff going round with a pot of tea and a pot of coffee in each hand, filling up half empty cups for the patrons. That's good service, but unfortunately, the staff sometimes didn't ask before pouring. This is typical and fine in a Chinese restaurant, where everyone is drinking Chinese tea. But when the patrons are drinking coffee or tea with milk and sugar, filling the half empty cups dilute the taste completely! That's etiquette.Coming to hygiene, there was an incident that stuck in my mind. As this was a buffet, the cutlery is not removed from the table throughout the meal, only the empty plates. As efficiency seems to be the top priority, the waiters were always in a hurry to clear the empty plates, and one of them, in clearing my companion's plate, lifted her fork and knife from her plates, and deposited them onto my bread plate! That was certainly a major letdown
5
Totally impressed by the food here. Favourite is the sticky date pudding with its vanilla sauce. Best of all. Knowing its my birthday, the staff took extra care and detail to my needs. Plus a birthday cake and song! A Big Thumbs Up to the Manager Anthony and Staff Rini who were in charge of my table
5
Wonderful time here. Great food. Great atmosphere and wonderful location It's at the right location and you see Singapore travellers as you sit there sipping your drink Great food and quick servic
5
This wasn't my first visit and I knew it was a crazy thing to do but the kids insisted on having their lunch here and on a Sunday too. As expected, it was a near full house and we had to wait in line. Fortunately, we had your hostess, Shen Ai to keep us company. Cheerful, friendly and always with a smile, she made it easier waiting for a table. Efficient and conscientious too - showing the guests quickly to their tables as soon as there was an available one and quickly rushing back to her post to greet new guests joining the queue. No dilly-dallying and disappearing for long periods. She's a credit to front liners and to your CafÃ©. As usual, food's good and service is great. That's why my family and I keep coming back, even on a crowded Sunday afternoon
5
Every time I visit the Marriott cafe I have a very enjoyable time. Both food and service are excellent. Especially the waitresses Sony and Melisa do their utmost to give you a very pleasant time during your dinner. Very recommendable
4
Sit outside open frontage but with cover overhead and large ceiling fans to keep.you cool. If it rains you don't get wet. Good choice of dishes with daily specials. The food we had was traditional and we were not sure what it was going to be until it arrived. Was different but tasty. Only down side beer is expensive but this seems to be typical in the Orchard Rd area
3
Overpriced for the food cathered during weekend lunch. Quantity is not choices too but location is good
3
Nothing extraordinary as you would expect from a typical Marriott spread. Spread of cold cuts, salads, meats, pasta, a Japanese counter, soups and breads as well as a few veg items and yes desserts...however no vow factor...including the ambience...but yes the servers were quite friendly..
3
First time to Marriott Cafe and it was for a Italian theme night with interesting dishes such as the pork ears and tongue. I loved the duck legs, crispy flavorful pork saddle and the creamy gnocchi. The salad bar had quite a variety to choose from too! Nonetheless, the charcuterie section was a tad disappointing, given that it's going by the Italian theme. Also, the cakes tasted dry and the saving grace was probably the two 'puddings': bread and butter pudding and sticky date. On a sidenote, the seating area was rather squeezey with little space to walk between side-to-side tables
3
Place packed in pretty quick for dinner right at 6:30pm. Buffet had a good spread but you got to watch your calories and pick the right dishes. Chilled prawns were sweet but could be fresher. Crab legs were a disappointment though, really salty so don't bother with anything exposed and just go for the middle of the legs. Crayfish was likewise almost as briny. Salmon and tuna sashimi were average at best with lackluster wasabi, maybe left out for too long? Oysters were the highlight of that row of seafood. Tasted fresh and were the right size. Seafood paella was tasty with fresh seafood with rice infused properly with the right seafood fresh flavors.On to the meats, there was a lot of meats available to sample. Beef rendang, beef cheek, pork cheek, veal marrow, veal heart, tongue and tripe. All pretty good. Roast beef however was tasteless though tender and juicy, fortunately lots of condiments to accompany. Don't bother with the crispy pork knuckle. Crispy enough but lacks the flavor which pales in comparison with off the counter pork knuckle available from Cold Storage or Giant supermarkets. Roast pork had a light flavor but the let down was the skin lacked the crunch. Best meat served was the duck, moist and flavorful meat with the crisp thin skin with all the fat melted away. Should have done that first and last to savor it. Good selection of cheeses and the prosciutto with rock melon was divine. Plentiful greens for the herbivore inclined patrons but yeah, if you haven't noticed, I'm not really a greens guy where buffet is concerned.Desserts were "meh"...usual selection of cakes, puddings and ice cream. Nothing to write home about so I wouldn't save any belly space for that
5
I came here recently with my family for its high tea buffet and it was awesome. There was a wide selection and service was courteous and prompt. The cafe is also very centrally located. Highly recommended
5
Had buffet breakfast daily during 4 night stay. Service excellent. Food fresh & large variety. Western & Asian, including ice cream! Omlette station. Replenished quickly. Thoroughly enjoyed it. Good staff

This is my second time writing this review. This is to confirm my first review and to see whether standard has deteriorated. I must say the service is excellent, has maintained; the food variety is still wide spread and I noticed the pastries section has increased in variety. I particularly, like the pizza and the Danish. The pizza is crispy and moist and the Danish has a local favour to it. I was impressed with the Mango fruit toppings. What a pleasant surprise!I also like the Hokkien fried noodles, its moist with strong seafood aroma sauce. If you like it a little more spicy, I have added their nasi lemak chilli sauce to it. Excellent!.Thank you Marriott Cafe, you're still my best hi-tea buffet in Singapore

It was a very nice place to sit. The spread had quite a lot, but not that great of a variety. The food is nice, but some of it was a little plain or just a bit mediocre in taste, especially in contrast to the price
3
The buffet lunch spread was acceptable. Service was great - plates were cleared fast and staff were attentive.A good place for a weekend catchup with friends
5
Good selection of breakfast options from western, local and other influential cuisines. Dim sums are nice and also the sticky toffee with ice cream and custard sauce to finish the breakfast was a goodness treat. Go try if around.

If you like people watching then look no further, this is a great place to go. But if it's drinks and good company that you want then it's not worth paying the premium to be here, it's over priced for what it is

A decade-old favourite of mine, the buffet at the Marriott Café is just outstanding. Although I'm not really a "buffet person", this is one of the rare exceptions I make. Especially the sea-food section with the oysters and the Moreton Bay Bugs dazzels again and again

The standards of Marriott Cafe Singapore has been so consistently good that a friend decided to celebrate his 60th birthday at this place. He loves everything about the place - the ambience, the food and the service. This time, it was no exception. The quality of food and service standards were high. Being a weekly regular, the birthday boy was given VIP treatment. Chefs prepared newly introduced dishes for him and his guests, and gave him a memorable 60th birthday. We would like to thank Chef Christian and Chef Nino for the special treats, and MoGan and Chai Lee for their dedicated and value-added services

Sit outside and watch the world go by on orchard. It is an great place to meet friends for a drink and the food is very good with many western and global options. Something for everyone. Enjoy

We went to the dinner buffet and the service was professional, personal and quick. Sushi and Sashimi as well as the spread of oysters and prawns were typical of such establishments, but the Singaporean cuisine spread and Gelatos were not. The Gelatos were too soft (perhaps it was because the lid was not closed by other diners that left it semi-molten) and the roasted chicken was not tender. And perhaps too it would be better to see more dishes from each respective cuisines, it would seem that apart from the Italian cuisine, the other cuisines like the Japanese were limited in choices of dishes
3
Came to catch up with a friend over some cocktails. Service was great. Cocktails were ok, but I've had better. This is a 5 Star Hotel Bar, so be prepared to pay for the service.
4
Really great place to eat with superb food, service, location and décor. It's expensive even for Singapore standards

We recently had a nice afternoon tea at Lobby Lounge, Marriot Tang Plaza Hotel. Basically it uses up the space at the lobby of the hotel, so make reservations or be there early to get a more secluded sofa seats. The afternoon tea set is priced at $33++ per adult with refillable food and selected coffee or tea. Worth a try and the service was good too
5
This is the restaurant I make a beeline for, whenever I come to Singapore. Buffet meal, lobsters on Sundays and many other tasty seafood are available. The roast beef is cooked to perfection - French-style and there is always a good selection of vegetables, cheese, bread and delicious desserts

I met 3 friends for afternoon tea in this outlet which is a part of the Marriott Hotel on Orchard Road. Some older readers may recall that this iconic building used to be known as the Dynasty Hotel and it is very close to the C K Tang Department store. First impressions were not good as we had to queue to get our table even though a reservation had been made. What slowed the process down was that there diners from lunch in the same queue trying to pay their bill. The initial impression was not at all warm or welcoming. This is really a kind of afternoon buffet rather than a traditional afternoon tea. My friends were going for soups and various hot dishes which they said were very good. Tea was poured into a mug by the staff but there was no offer of an alternative tea, it seems it was English breakfast or coffee. I had some of the sandwiches. There were 3 types on offer, smoked salmon, tuna and cheese & ham. The ham they had used was very tasty. I also tried some of the pizza pieces which were offered. The mushroom one was very tasty and if they serve it whole in the evenings it might be worth a return visit. There was a reasonable display of deserts including hot bread and butter pudding and a date pudding. Nothing that was particularly creative or imaginative. I opted for a couple of small sultana scones with some cream and jam. During the serving the engineering department started doing some work on the area where the sandwiches had been displayed. This meant that the sandwiches were now at eye level and difficult see for some of the smaller guests. Service was not attentive. We constantly had to ask for used crockery to be removed and the drinks refilled. Whilst, I confess, I did enjoy the sandwiches on offer it was not an experience that I would rush to repeat. There are much better afternoon teas on offer in Singapore

Prior to my visit this afternoon, my family and I were looking forward to this buffet lunch as it is not an everyday affair that we will take time out to make a reservation for a hotel buffet. The variety of the food was okay, was certainly not wonderful but I thought, well it's okay as well as I have an enjoyable visit. However, it was not long before a staff chef named Seo Jun spoiled our meal with her terrible attitude and cockiness. First, I was standing at the spaghetti counter for a period of time but she acted as if she could not see her customers. Second, after she noticed her customer, she took my order: 'Aglio Olio'. She then asked with a very low volume (albeit rudely) a question which I did not catch, so I told her 'with mushrooms'. However, she became really rude and without looking up, she exclaimed without any courtesy: 'CHOOSE YOUR PASTA!'. I was shocked. I believe my sister in front of me and the customers behind me could sense her extreme rudeness. However, at that time, I did not want to make a big fuss, so I quietly chose my pasta. After she cooked finished, I said thank you to her, and at the same time, told her that she was being very rude. However, there was no apology from her. After which, I was back to the buffet spread area and our eyes met. This was when it got too much. She gave me a cocky look and she seemed to think that treating her customers with this attitude is perfectly fine. I have given a feedback form to the counter and I am glad that there was a quick action from them. However, I wish to iterate that this meal had spoilt my entirely day and nothing can make up the emotional damage she had caused. It was the first time I was being treated so rudely and insincerely. This Korean staff Seo Jun is extremely unprofessional and unsuited to be in the service line as it does not only affects a customer's day, but also the entire image of the hotel chain itself. What a meal it was. If you need help identifying the staff, you can contact me at glow005@e.ntu.edu.sg PS: I may have spelled her name wrongly, but this was what I heard from one of your staff when I asked

Lots of seafood offered, from sashimi to prawns, and oysters. The quality and selection was plentiful and fresh.
5
I have been many times and will revisit. From meetig friends for drinks, sharing or solo dining this location good for people watching too! Love the open fresco dining
4
The range of food was extensive and the quality also good for a hotel breakfast. Service was friendly and pleasant and overall this was better than expected
5
Unexpected service from waiter Devendra and waitress Simrin. They are friendly, knowledgable about the food and daily specialty item. Simrin is humble and approachable. I would like thank them for pleasant meal and personally service. This guys are asset for the hote

Had to make a quick stop here with visiting friends in search of a child's meals. Pleasantly surprised at the available children's menu and choice. Had apart from the usual drinks, the kids meal spaghetti strings.. simple fare. Found the use of tomato sauce OK but maybe a tad too sour for the 3 year old. Pricing wise I found it pricey but acceptable given its in Orchard and a hotel. Ambience of the place was typical hotel cafe and not too warm. Service on the other hand was extremely friendly and accommodating to a noisy child, which had his parents embarrassed to a degree. Hats off to 2 staff ; a most polite Indian man (pity could'nt catch his name) and a lady (I think her name was Simrim - sorry if I got it wrong) for making the occasion really nice and for having the customer first can do attitude.Conclusion : 4 THUMBS UP. Will come again and again
5
What a cafe too watch the world go by the best place in Singaporeif you like watching people going about there business.I personally like sitting outside as the corner is so busy and the foodis great.John the chef is a great guy and a great chef and sometimes is wandering around outside say hello too him.I usually stay at the marriott mainly because the location is the bestof any hotel in Singapore big savings on taxi fares and the underground is just across Orchard road
5
Excellent service from a waitress named Simrin. We went there for a dinner and she attended to my boy, 3 yo, who was a little grumpy from his nap. Simrin delighted my boy with 2 lollipops and finally he eats his dinner and we get to enjoy the dinner too. When we commented the tea was a little too bland and she offered to brew a new tea for us. A very friendly, excellent oriented service staff, Simrin - thank you!

I am a British person who has a wide experience of restaurants (including Michelin starred ones in UK), and can unreservedly congratulate Marriot Hotel, Singapore on the excellence of the dining experience they provide. I have dined there many times, including last night at the New Years Eve Banquet.Firstly, the waiters, waitresses and other staff are truly excellent. Grumpy staff, who are having a bad day and don’t have the self-discipline and skill to put on a happy face, can ruin a dinner with the energy they emanate. When we had our New Years dinner at Marriot last night, they were marvelously friendly and endlessly attentive, and we left feeling that they were our old friends. In many restaurants there are often some dishes which don’t work, some flops, but Marriot doesn’t falter for a moment. Last night, even the mashed potato, a fairly simple dish, was flavoured with garlic to perfection. The meats were exquisite, and for me the summit was the stewed beef cheek. It melted like butter in the mouth with the most wonderful flavors of wine and herbs. The variety of dishes was also excellent, so much so that I wished I had more stomachs! The presentation of the food is also impossible to criticise. Since this a review I suppose I should try to think of a negative, a shadow in the wonderful sunlit landscape. I noticed at the banquet last night that the children left the iced cream area opened while they decided which flavor they wanted, and as a result the iced creams became a little slushy. A well placed sign could remedy this minor speck of a problem.The ambience of Marriot is also beautiful, with the sounds and sights of water, nice high ceilings: space, air, and a feeling of sumptuousness.Congratulations! The staff at Marriot are not staff, they are artists who have attained the highest levels of virtuosity and greatness! I mean it! You have made my 2016 already! I love you

Last NYE, my 2 best friends and I celebrated the occasion in Marriott Cafe Bangkok, welcoming 2015. This NYE, we did it at Marriott Singapore. It was fabulous! The service, quality and variety of food, and the atmosphere were all great as usual, but on this occasion we had a visual feast! The chefs obviously put a lot of thought into the display of the food items. There was also a band singing songs of the eighties. It was the perfect way to welcome 2016! Thanks, Marriott Singapore for treating us like VIP's. I'll let the pictures speak

Local food especially the oyster omelette was great. Nice selection of other cuisines as well. The sticky date pudding dessert was also v nice
5
Best buffet for all three meals. Try even the hi- tea. Make reservations in advance, it sells out fast.
5
Ate here almost each day of my three week stay in Singapore. The spread is extensive and the service is prompt. Loved their special smoothies made fresh every morning. The chef at the live eggs counter was very friendly and made yummy omelettes.
5
imagine arriving at your venue for dinner and was told your reservation was for Christmas day dinner instead of Xmas eve. the place was completely choked with guests. A brave manager came along and with definite decision and table manipulation managed to create a table for 2 very anxious customers. Well done Mr. Lai. Your gesture will definitely be greatly appreciated and rest assured I shall be a Marriott Gold Card member for many more years to come 
4
Book the buffet dinner for 4 about a month in advance as my many previous attempt to book them were unsuccessful as booking is always full. (This just show how popular the place is.) Surprisingly, even on e Monday nite, the restaurant is full to the rim. Food served is great and I particularly like the huge cold snow crab, crispy pork n stew lamp. hopefully my cholestrol don't shoot up the roof after taking several serving of snow crabs which not many buffet dinner restaurant served them. The raw oysters though fresh, is a bit disappointing as the size is comparatively smaller that those served in 2 other restaurants that I patronised the last 2 months. The price tag for the dinner? S$80++/adult. But fortunately, there was a 1 for 1 promotion by the cafe for UOB credit card holders. As such, I walk out of the cafe happily having half my bill but with our stomach full

The Marriott Tang Plaza Hotel cooks up a pretty tasty dinner buffet. Make sure to visit on a Friday or Saturday night for the Boston lobster! I was very happy with the variety of food on offer, especially the tasty selection of seafood and roast meats. There wasn't a big selection of sashimi and sushi, but the fresh oysters and sweet snow crab legs more than made up for that shortcoming. Although I focused mainly on the seafood, roast meats and ham, I did sample a number of local and international hot dishes (including the made-to-order pasta) and have no complaints. For those with a sweet tooth, the variety of western and local desserts (and ice cream) will not disappoint.I would like to commend the service staff for doing an excellent job in constantly clearing dirty dishes and assisting with the customers' needs/requests. My glass of water never once went empty.Will highly recommend the dinner buffet. It's no surprise why I faced such difficulties in getting a confirmed reservation
5
What a day to start with a wide spread of food to choose from.Staff were all friendly and good service. just make sure you book yourself in advance as it seems to be quite packed at most times,lovely people .Great breakfast Team
4
Marriott cafe is a sure win when you want to treat family and friends to a good meal over gatherings or celebration! Never cease to impress

My wife and had the buffet dinner on a Sunday evening and were pleased with the spread and with the quality. The oyster were really good and large, the roast beef was excellent. Oddly enough there were no lamb dishes but even so it was altogether very enjoyable
4
Overall, the quality of the food was good, especially the fresh seafood like oysters and prawns as well as the sashimi. However, some items could be further improved like the mala soup which was a little bland and the turkey which did not taste as good as I had hoped. One very commendable thing is the excellent and prompt service of the service staff as they were super fast in clearing our plates, ensuring that there was no pile-up of used plates at any time. Quick and stealth :) Great job
5
Stayed 10 nights at this fabulous hotel and enjoyed the buffet breakfast in the CafÃ© every morning. It is open for walk in as well, and is highly recommended for a weekend brunch. Its selection caters for all nationalities I dare say, with everything from local spreads, maki rolls, noodles, dumplings, freshly made fruit juices to Danish, muffins, American pancakes, whole grain organic bread, bacon, eggs in all shapes, cheese... you name it, they have it! Very friendly staff are efficient and polite and you can choose between outdoor seating with fans or indoor aircon. A breakfast cost around 50++ SGD, so quite pricy, but ohhh so good!
5
One of my favourite buffet in Singapore! Love the buffet spread.. Personally super in love with the PASTA station. I can go for 3-4 servings of pasta on every visit! Cream Pasta!
4
Excellent Buffet options for Breakfast and the food is great. Great service from all the staff. Good for Family, Groups or just on your own.
5
I am such a picky eater and this café has everything you could want - the bakery is adjacent to the café so you can see bread baked.
5
I love the Marriott Cafe as it has so many offerings that come at very decent quality. The staff is quiet attentive.

It was exciting to be here have a great Christmas dinner .But the food here is not good as you thinkLike How to eat with a very HOT plate and HOT bowl to eat ice cream or sashimi or Cheese?? This is basic totally not acceptable!!!!!And Pasta station I order a pesto pasta its very salty.......There is another one stir fry French beans NO taste at ALL its flat I cant believe this one made it worse than food court.Last is dessert , Its A disaster! We try all , ALL we cant finish each only one is the brownies it is very sad.Basically food here is too salty or no flavor no taste no balance at all and I think the pastry chef can change another one!An there is a girl after her dinner vomiting on my girlfriend's LV bag as you can imagine........I wont come here again
5
Went dinner on Friday night and restaurant was packed to brim. However service was not compromised as there were many wait staffs clearing dishes. Food spread was fantastic with many selections ranging from succulent lobsters, to fresh sashimi and cook-to-order pasta station. Usual BBQ meat items and hot cooked food were equally tasty. Wide array of yummy chocolate desserts on display as well. Overall good feasting experience though a little cramped
4
I prefer Marriott Cafe for a weekend dinner buffet. First, they offer a free-flow of Boston lobster. Yes, I love lobster! The second and most important reason: I get the 1-for-1 promo when I pay with my Amex Platinum card. It's an all-year round promo (at the point of this writing). It saves me a lot of money as I usually go for buffet with my wife.The highlight of the buffet for me: Boston lobster, Alaskan crab leg, oyster, prawn, slipper lobster (crayfish), black pepper crab, and durian trifle. The roast beef, lamb and pork saddle are nice too. The pork saddle skin was crispy but quite salty, I felt. They offer prawn in herbal soup too. Tastes great! Of course, there are the other standard fares like sashimi, pasta station, chinese dishes, and desserts (a wide variety of).I know of two other hotels in Orchard that offer weekend dinner buffet with free-flow of Boston lobster too. Carousel and Makan@Jen. Unless I am craving for their unique offerings, however, I think I will stick to Marriott Cafe due to the Amex card promo
1
Had the buffet tea service here. The food quality was poor - hot dishes were cold; finished items were not topped up quickly enough, staff were not well trained. For an establishment like this they ought to do much, much better
5
I had most of my breakfasts at the Marriott Cafe this trip. I love the variety of healthy food as well as the ability to mix Western and local food
5
I must congratulate the Marriott administration for having a wonderful catering team at the Marriott Cafe. I have been a very frequent diner there and have not once been disappointed by the exceptionally professional chefs and waiters and waitresses there. Right from Daniele the Italian chef to Nino the Philippino the attention shown is most impeccable. Rest assured you will get my continual support. Thanks.
4
Excellent breakfast buffet with extraordinary selection of dishes from a wide range of cuisines, fresh and nicely presented, supported with friendly, helpful service.
5
Fantastic food, superb service Jocelyn,Megan,Will and kitchen staffs, head Chef and Managers. Good job guys. Thanks
5
I always love dining in Marriott as they always exceed my expectations. The buffet spread was very nice, I love the cuisines and it is surely worth every penny you pay for it. The ambience and service was also very good, a quick escape from the busy streets. Definitely will come back for more
4
Spread was great! Enjoyed the fresh oysters but missed the lobsters. Apparently lobster is not available at all times. Loved the crispy pork knuckles and char siew. My favourites are the bread and butter pudding and sticky date pudding drizzled in vanilla and chocolate sauce respectively. Was stuffed and didn't try all the food. Will come back again :

This review is solely for the SG50 High Tea at Marriott Cafe. I went for the Saturday High Tea (Sep2015). The High Tea is from 3pm until 5:30pm. S$39++ for Monday to Friday High Tea. S$42++ for Saturday & Sunday High Tea. The restaurant is having a SG50 theme until end of Nov2015. There is a promotion going on at the hotel and if you reserve the High Tea for a weekday(Mon-Fri), and if you are within the first 50 person of the reservation list for the day, you get to pay S$50nett for 2 person for the SG50 High Tea.I took photos of almost all the dishes except for those at the Fruit Rojak area. I saw some pineapple, guava, and some other fruits that I cannot remember at the Rojak table. Tea & coffee are served by the waiters. Sugar and milk can be found at every table.For the rest of the dishes, please refer to my photos. Overall, the food was average in taste. Given the full price I paid, about S$98 for 2 person, I would say that it is way overpriced and not value for money at all. For the promotion price of S$50nett for 2 person, I would still say that it is not a "must-go", but rather "go or don't go also can". Everything has taste, not really very bad, but definitely not in the very-tasty category. I heard the chicken rice was from Wen Hao chinese restaurant in the hotel and that it was quite famous, I haven't check if this is true. I wasn't wowed by it but the rice is definitely more tasty than those from normal chicken rice stall. It has the chicken fat taste in the rice which is good. The ginger paste however was very watery and not much ginger taste. Another item worth mentioning is the prawn, which was crunchy and juicy and sweet. From my own experience, having tasted the SG50 dishes at S$98 for two, I decided not to come back for the promo S$50 for two, for the same dishes. I may come back if I see more good reviews in the future for their buffet other than SG50. Enjoy the 51 photos i put up

I brought an overseas friend of mine for the English hightea here at the Marriot. We were deciding between Hyatt (where she was putting up) and Marriot. Im really glad we decided on Marriot eventually after checking this place out. The enviorment is cosy, seats are comfortable, there was quite a variety of sweet and savory selection available. The best part of our experience is the service rendered by one of the staff- Ms Oak. She is warm, friendly and personable. She made it a point to check on our well being every once in a while and was promt in her service despite the crowd. She carries a smile with her at all times. I am very happy with her service and she is definately a great asset to the hotel. Thank you for your great service, Oat! Keep up the good work!!! :

I must commend the restaurant for maintaining consistency in the quality of fresh seafood for their buffet. I went for their Sunday lunch twice and was equally impressed by the quantity and quality. Their fresh and succulent lobsters are very popular but the restaurant is equally generous and ensured that they refilled fast enough for their diners. I would highly recommend Marriott Cafe to all seafood lovers but do check the availability of lobster on the menu when making reservations

Hello everyone, let me tell you about my previous experience. In February, i visit Marriott Cafe, and was wowed by their selection, their cuts of meat, parma ham... wow. Great service, ambiance and food. Yesterday, i celebrated my birthday there... had high tea because their reservations for lunch and dinner were hard to get. First impression, aircon wasn't working. I commented about it and a server said they are working on it. When i asked about 45 mins later whether the airconditioning was fixed, another server offered to change my seat... by this time i was perspiring and uncomfortable... i thought i wouldn't be around much longer so i declined to be moved. What went through my mind was that.... they could and should have offered me a different seat from the start. They were at about 40% capacity. Dishes were dirty... not one or two... you could clearly see about 8 different dirty dishes as i walked around... they weren't cleaned properlyFood selection - almost all local delights... good for tourist i guess... but they are getting seriously short changed. Satay was awesome.... thats about it...Ba Kut teh was watery.. when i gave feedback... a reluctant chef brought out a distinctly different colored soup and offered it to my table. It was Delicious... nothing compared to the colored water we had earlier. The chef mumbled some excuse... Chili crab sauce was watered down, no flavor... chef commented that they use vinegar... obviously they haven't had chili crab outside.. what a terrible imitation...Banana Chocolate Crepe looked like mush... All in all... High tea was a disappointment... Terrible ambiance, seemly untrained, loitering wait staff... sub-par selection of food... horrible quality... stay away.. you've been warned. what more, they were so unreceptive to feedback..

My hubby and I happened to have a voucher offered by a local bank. We decided to enjoy our brunch at the cafe. We were greeted by a manager and were led to our table. All started well and we were happy. The food was served fast and presentations were good. However, my local food choice of fried beef hor fun was bland, the choice of cut was terrible. I can hardly even chew the beef, what more to swallow it.My hubby alerted one of the waiter and the message of the Hor fun issue was passed on to the manager. The manager dealted with the problem professionally offering a change of the hor fun to the seafood version, which I declined as I wasn't able to finish it anyways. He took the cost of the hor fun out of the total bill and we were pretty grateful about it. As everything settles down into a relaxing mood, sipping mocktail and enjoying the view, we heard a waitress passing comments about customers using vouchers issued by the bank was kind a troubling. As there were also another couple sitting by the table next to us, were too using a similar voucher, the waitress commented about the cafe not presenting itself well as a 5-star hotel with so many customers using vouchers for free food. We further observed that waitress and found that she is quick to serve foreigners but not locals. I am disturbed to witness such unprofessional service personnel rendered in such a well reputable hotel. I hope that the hotel will somehow retrain their staff to achieve fair and excellence services to all customers

Had dinner in this restaurant and was not disappointed at all. Not expecting too much with this place but was surprised how good the food, the service and the ambience of this ppace. There is not much of a variety but food was delicious, staff are courteous and buffet area's cleanliness is maintained. Not a fan of the dessert section though but overall it is very good. Will definitely go back
5
Excellent service and the food is fantastic. Your new waitress Maricy is outstanding and very polite. Thank you for the wonderful service.
5
Lovely cafe with excellent cakes and pastries. Staff was polite and professional and prices were good for Singapore. Lovely place!

Made a reservation on 02 Sep 2015 for dinner as the cafe has a SG50 promo of which is 2 persons for the price of 1. Wide spread of buffet and spent like 3 hours enjoying the food slowly. Besides serving cold spread of oysters, snow crabs, crayfish, sashimi, etc, they also served hot and cooked dishes. The dessert choice was also reasonable. Had enjoyed the dinner very much with my loved one
3
Visited just over the weekend for the high tea buffet and there was a big group of us, with some young kids. The spread was pretty good, lots of variety and mostly, rather tasty. However, service was completely drab. We were seated near the entrance, which was really warm and completely unfriendly for the kids, since there are water features around the area. The staff hardly came over to where we sat to check on us. So, for the longest time I couldn't even order a drink. When I needed a refill, I had to literally walk to where the staff were congregating (inside, because the air-conditioner is there was much cooler I reckon!) and asked for a refill myself. Most of the staff are young and seem to be not very well trained. One forgot about the drink I ordered when everyone else's drink arrived. It was quite a disaster in that sense. Especially since the tables we were seated at were really warm and we needed cold drinks. There was practically none offered and we could hardly find anyone to serve us. Improvement or retraining of wait staff badly needed. I may go back again, only if I get a table inside the restaurant itself, nowhere near the entrance and nowhere near the water features
4
I used the entertainer voucher, which was buy 1 buffet lunch get one free. Made a reservation on the day itself and the manager I think at the restaurant a nice Philippino lady squeezed us in. When we arrived she moved us to a normal seat as were by the bar, which was great and she was very helpful.You can't really compare the spread here to Shangri la's line cafe, but even to regents hotel buffet, the food here isn't quite worth paying full price. They have a decent choice but nothing is great. The beef and pork is probably the best they have which is on par with any buffet in Singapore I've been to. But the Asian kitchen and the Italian is very average, the gnocchi looked fantastic but was very plane, and the cheese spread is minimal and looks like more of an after thought than any thing else. They are not short on guests - the place was packed and it was a little bit frustrating with the longer lines than normal. A can of coke cost 10$ which is a bit of a joke and I feel unnecessary but fine it's a hotel.All in all, it's a good place if your in town and have some sort of voucher. Usual price around 68$ per head which just isn't justified. At 34$ though which we paid it was fantastic and I have no complaints.Not sure who the lady was on duty that day but she was fantastic and unfortunately it's quite rare in Singapore to have good service and mediocre food , it's usually the other way around!Will probably come back as the entertainer gives another BOGOF dinner buffet, hopefully the dinner choices are better!

This must be the worst high tea I have ever had in my life. For the record, I have been to many high teas in Singapore for the last 25 years.Our regular family favorite, Rose Veranda at Shangri La was fully booked, so we came here. Incidentally they were having a SG50 promo of 2 pax for SGD50++. Normal price is SGD39 ++ pp.This place is noisy, with no ambience. The food quality is poor. Chilly crab dip is more like diluted tomato ketchup. Normally Nasi Lemak (coconut rice) is served with fried chicken wings, fried anchovies, sambal (cooked chilli paste) otah (grill fish paste). When the buffet started at 3pm, I saw a tray of chicken wings next to the rest of the Nasi Lemak condiments. When I went after 20 mins, the tray was empty. After 1 hour, the chicken wings were still not replaced. I asked the waitress if they were going to replenish it, and she came back to say that they have run out! What a joke. Cheap stuff, and they don't even replenish. The noodle section had Laksa and prawn noodles. But they do not have laksa noodles. Give me the impression, the food at high tea are left over from the lunch buffet. The nonya kuehs were bland too. No flavor. The cakes were not cut into proper slices, and were left there for diners to "scoop and cut" with the cake server. Disgusting after a few diners have shut their pieces.The coffee and tea they serve are also only from the pot. Way before the standard of places at shangri La or Fullerton Bay which serve proper gourmet coffee and tea. Not sure if they have skim on the quality because of the SG50 promo. Frankly, even at the promo rate of 2pax for SGD50, I think it is not worth it. Don't bother coming if it is at the regular price of SGD39 pp.Definitely below the standard is expect of a high tea at a 5 start hotel. Very disappointing

Came for the SG50 afternoon tea. A good local selection but compared to other afternoon tea photos on tripadvisor looks like there were fewer dishes than normal. The hokkien mee, char kway tiao and laksa were very good. The beef rendang was also very tasty. Prata seemed to be abit dry. Satay was good but the peanut sauce was too watery. Nasi lemak was also quite authentic, scone was ok. But the cream doesnt look like clotted cream, just normal cake cream. The carrot cake was nice with walnuts. Smoked salmon was ok and i am glad there was lemon and capers. Limited seafood, just prawns that looked boiled and not very appetising. Not a kueh person so didnt try. Didnt see any kue lapis. The tau suan didnt have any dough fritters with it so it was a pity. It would be better if local drinks are also served to complete the SG50 theme eg. Teh tarik, kopi, teh c, teh halia etc instead of just english tea and coffee. Overall good buffet. I would like to try non SG50 version too

Definitely not the place to go if you're in a hurry. The Marriott Cafe allows you to enjoy your meal without you feeling there are other patrons eyeing your seat. Reservations have to be made. The variety of delectable food is massive, fresh and delicious. The beef cheeks is one of those dishes that commanded me to leave my seat for more

This was the second time we're had a buffet lunch at Marriott Cafe and they continue to provide good food and attentive service. On this occasion, they served lobsters for the weekend lunch buffet although at a higher price. The decor in the inner part of the cafe seems dated and requires a much needed facelift and new furniture
3
Average. Disappointing. Surprisingly lacking flavor. We did a la carte, which may have been the mistake since the buffet option (while much more expensive) probably compensated in that something good would have been served. But the location was great, as was the option to sit outside in a bustling shopping district.
4
The cafe is part of the Marriott Hotel and it is handy both for its clients and for people shopping in the area. It offers a nice selection of food and drinks in a relaxed atmosphere,

Was there to celebrate birthday. The variety was alot and the service crew there were attentive, friendly and efficient.

Location - next to Tangs Shopping Centre, take an MRT to Orchard or a taxi to Marriot Hotel Orchard Road. There is also parking available.I enjoyed the widespread buffet, Eastern and Western. Had rojak to my hearts content. There was laksa, prawn noodle soup, chilli crab sauce to go with your bun, pizza, etc just too many to mention.I guess the fact that you have shopped till your legs are going to giveway and find this nice spot in the midst of the shopping, it's a "thank you".There's also nice coffee to go with your food

My relatives and I went for the buffet at the Marriott Cafe just yesterday. Food were pretty disappointing, houseflies can be seen flying around the pizza area and even at the place I was sitting at. The standard of the food is just average, didn't leave me feeling like WOW. I remember eating the "Chilli crab sauce with man tou" and the "man tou" were tough and cold. The pizza itself was also pretty cold-tasting and kind of hard as well, wasn't pleasing to my taste buds at all. What is WORSE, was that my Aunt was about to eat an oyster when she realized that there was a really long WORM on the shell of the oyster. THIS IS DISGUSTING? No service recovery was offered, only an apology. Oh yes not forgetting, the ice cream compartment was not cold enough, my ice cream was already melting as soon as I scooped it into my bowl. However, the F&B server was really helpful and efficient in terms of responding to our requests. Overall, I guess I'll have to think twice about returning again

We had the chance to taste the famous Sunday Hi-Tea as well as breakfast at this hotel. From what we hear, the Hi-Tea is usually booked months in advance and now we see why. There is a huge selection of food from international to local. Fresh oysters, crawfish, sushi, indian fare, and chinese. You'll need a big appetite to be able to sample everything. For desserts, there is ice-cream, cakes and other local desserts like chendol or ice kachang. And for breakfast, they also offer fresh squeezed juices. You can select your own fruits for the mix. There is an omelet station, pancakes, bacon, sausage if you prefer American breakfast. Or, there is porridge with condiments, and other noodles and light dim sum for Asian breakfast. Service is prompt. They do remove your finished plates while you're at the buffet getting your next. We will recommend booking in advance if you plan on trying the hi-tea.
5
On behalf of my friends, I will like to thank David, Chuck, Will and Myra for the kind and warm hospitality. Service was awesome! Other than that, wagyu burger is delicious. I like the self-service wine dispenser. Very interactive. Good job to the team. For sure, i'll definitely come back again for more

Went for Saturday (1 Aug) high-tea buffet with my wife and her family and spread was pretty good. It is almost like a normal lunch buffet with a wide variety of food and it is pretty tasty.Service wise is so-so. Staff were over-zealous in clearing our plates even though we had unfinished food on it, which happened a few times and was quite a turn off.My brother-in-law felt nauseous on the same night and did not feel too well. We didn't think much about it as we thought he ate too much. However on Monday night (2 days after), my stomach felt weird and I started to feel feverish and nauseous on Tuesday. Vomited and had diarrhea on Tuesday night. I did not make any connection to the episode that my brother-in-law had, until my mother-in-law also started to feel nauseous and vomited as well. I do not have meals with my wife's family often and didn't eat anything in common, except the high tea buffet on Saturday. It is likely that 3 of us had something bad at the buffet.Otherwise i'd still go back
5
I would like to comment on their services and food! Both the service and food are perfect! Fast service! Well for food wise I think it's good as well. I came here for high tea and I specially like the laska they serve! Definitely a right place for celebration

This review is for the lobby lounge in Marriot Hotel which serves the English high tea priced at $30++.Received some high tea vouchers with CIMB credit card promotion and was there for English high tea on a weekday. Upon arrival and placing our order for drinks (coffee and tea), it took the staff about 30 mins before the drinks were served. By then, we are already halfway through our cakes and sandwiches. It would be nice to have the tea served first or together do that one can enjoy the tea with the food.They allow refill for high tea items and thus only serve us a set for the three of us. The macaroons, scones and quiche were nice with some sandwiches such as smoked salmon, Ham and cheese and cucumber. A wide selection of tea which was quite fragrant and nice when they were finally served.The lobby lounge appears to be understaffed and not able to meet the demands of the diners (despite being in a weekday).I would have preferred the high tea to be served as a selection of items and be charged for each person than being refillable, at least we get to savour more items at a go, then having to wait for our rounds for the refill.Overall, I won't pay $30++ for their English High Tea, fell below my expectations, consider it being in a 5 star hotel... It was also rather warm in the lounge with the glass ceiling above it. I have tasted better high tea both in Singapore and Hong Kong, won't visit if not for the vouchers given

Chai Lee is a very courteous, smiling and service friendly staff. We are touched by his service rendered in the cafe as he made us feel at home, relaxed and comfortable. We will not hesitate to come back again with some friends.Thank you.Mrs Julia Lu
5
The room was very clean, very good food, very good location for shopping. The staff was very helpful. I used the exercise facilities which were very adequate and what I expected. The courtesy lounge for Marriott Platinum members was very well stocked mornings and evenings.
5
We popped by for a late night drink and was told that we had 20 minutes before the crossroad cafe closes. The waiter Mannan welcomed us nevertheless, even suggesting alternative places where we can go for drinks. He accommodated our requests to stay and have a quick drink making us feel at home though it's near closing hours.He was exemplary in extending good service regardless the time of the day. It's been a pleasure and rare to find such good service. Travelled around the world and have seen plenty, so I appreciate good service when I see one. Please extend my thanks to Mannan for his outstanding warm gesture.Regards,Nu
5
We walk into Crossroad Cafe at 12:30am with my friends and Mr Mannan a friendly staff from Marriott was so accommodating, even though they were about to close for the day. He warmly welcomed us and explain the cocktail promotion, his service was great. We will definitely come back again for more drinks and Marriott's staffs friendly service.

The staff at the Marriott Cafe does an incredible job of creating a warm and friendly customer atmosphere. They remembered my name after 2 visits and always address me when I visit. The breakfast buffet is awesome. There is something for everyone. You can top off your breakfast with an ice cream cone for the road!!
5
Excellent service provided by. Chia Lee and Lucus , Len . Tonight we a party of six had an awesome dinner . Very attentive shown by the service staff . A+++ service excellent. Thank you for making a wonderful an unforgettable buffer .we be back . Sophia / sherilyn 12/7/2015A

The high tea buffet spread was normal and the price is high for the selections of food available. There were no signature dishes to distinguish it from other restaurants. The taste was average. The laksa lacks the authentic local flavour, possibly because one or more ingredients/spices were not used in the cooking process. I had to remind the service staff a few times to refill my glass if iced water (you would expect the staff to be observant and do this without being told). Also, the first staff didn't bring me a cup of warm water despite acknowledging my request and I had to inform another one, and he ended up wrongly serving 2 cups of hot tea that were meant for the next table.Overall, it was quite a disappointment and we are unlikely to return
5
We brought our dad for Fathers' Day buffet lunch. He loves seafood so we thought we'll give it a try. The place was comfortable and cozy. The service was excellent. The staff were very attentive and tended to our needs fast. The buffet spread was one of the best I've ever had and they had a great variety of seafood - lobsters, oysters, prawns. And you don't have to worry it will run out for the chefs kept refilling them. I love the desserts too. The roast section was also very good. It's expensive in comparison to others but one that we will definitely return for
5
Amazing food and service in a strategic location. Staff are very friendly , ask for Mannon he will give you the best suggestions and attention!!! Been having amazing food in here and great room service Shopping, relaxing , business and luxury !!! All of them at once !!! A must do !!

Just had dinner here tonight Now it's the one of the most expensive dinner buffet in Singapore at $70++ which is pretty expensive 1) selection of food plentiful - Yes but don't expect much2) taste of food - the cold platter were much better than their ready cooked food 3) consolation were their sweets which has more than 15 varieties and not too sweet to our taste Overall I will not visit here again, unless someone else pays for it! Definitely I would recommend other hotel buffets with better value for your pocket and much more tasteful

I have visited Marriott Cafe a few times before and most recently visited as they had a 1 for 1 promotion. With the 1 for 1 promotion, I consider this one of the most value for money lunch buffets in Singapore. After the promotion, the price per person was about 30 dollars and the spread consisted of free flow sashimi, oysters and prawns. These are most commonly seen in dinner spreads so for the price I paid, I really felt it was extremely worth it. The pasta section was also amazing, but I miss the times I had the squid ink pasta, as it was always something I looked forward to when I dined at Marriott Cafe. The service staff were very efficient in clearing the used plates and refilling our water, which added to the great dining experience. I will definitely come back for more during such promotion periods as the spread is really one of the best among hotel buffets. The desserts all looked very tempting, and I especially love the bread and butter pudding, something I will never miss when I dine there! If you like soup, do check out the soups too, I particularly enjoyed the ginseng herbal chicken soup as it tasted very light and healthy
5
Staff are friendly and helpful.
Food is nice, especially the prawns and oysters are very fresh. Frequently replenish when depleted. One staff actually took the initiative to serve lemon and honey for tea. Very impressed.
5
This restaurant is on the sidewalk outside of the hotel. It has a great menu and the food qualify is first class. It also offers a wide variety of beer and other drinks.
5
just had time to have a snack, before leaving, nice menu good selection of wines, food was well presented, and service was friendly and
4
While the food choices is not as vast as other cafe, the service offered by the crews is top notched.
Sahul and team took the extra mile to find seats for us despite it being fully reserved that night.
5
Great value buffet breakfast. Good food (great continental stuff), with a dynamic open kitchen and the nicest chefs. Desmond (pictured) displays high positive contagious energy and a great smile every morning (except Thu/Fri).
5
Our credit card company had a 1 for 1 high tea buffet promotion so we had been trying to book for a few weeks but it was so popular that we were put on the waiting list. When we finally got a table, we understood what all the hype was about! Quality, quantity and variety, and very reasonably priced with the promotion. We particularly liked the fresh succulent prawns, fragrant bak kut teh, lemak laksa with a kick, smooth mango cake and cheese cake, and the mango ice cream with fresh cubes of mango in it. Service was excellent all the way, with free flow coffee and tea, nothing was too much for our attentive waitresses. Right at the end, we had an unpleasant glitch with our credit card, which was slightly embarrassing, but everyone was very gracious, patient and understanding. In short, definitely worth a try, if you can successfully get seats! Thank you all for a lovely experience

Last Sunday was Father’s Day and my extended family and I had the Father’s Day lunch at CrossRoads Café.For this lunch on a Sunday, the restaurant was packed. Despite the crowd, the food was replenished continuously and I never saw an empty tray of food for long. Kudos to the restaurant chefs!The restaurant’s buffet area is neatly laid out in a rectangle in the middle, where you have the following sections around it:- Sushi & Sashimi: A variety of sushi and 2 types of sashimi (Salmon and Tuna) were available. - Chilled seafood: Crab legs, cray fish, freshly shucked oysters and prawns. All were good, especially the prawns which were sweet and succulent. The crab legs were also good. - Noodles: You can have your choice noodles and the staff will cook for you. Chicken soup and mala souo were available. - Asian Roast Meats: Roast chicken, roast duck and Roast pork were on offer. All were yummy!- Desserts: Ice cream, cakes (salted caramel, tiramisu in a cup, cheese cake, Antoinette), Bo Bo Char Char- Stews: They had ox tongue, fish, roast carrots and potatoes. The ox tongue was good. - Grill: Bone on Ham, pork saddle (like pork belly), roast beef. The pork saddle is good, perfect with apple sauce!- European station: They had pork cheek, beef cheek and truffle polenta. Along the side wall, there are the following sections:- Roast meats: Leg of ham, Roast beef and more, with different types of sauces and condiments.- Breads: There were different types of breads and even mini pizzas.- Salad: I love the various types of olives that were available here. - Cold Cuts: Ham, Salami and freshly shaved Parma ham. The restaurant had a couple of dishes for this weekend that I had not experienced at my previous visits. These include:- Crab Legs and Cray Fish- Foie Gras- Sauteed prawns- More varieties of meats at the grill section- Greater variety of desserts, especially Bo Bo Char Char, which I absolutely love and I had 3 mini bowls of it!Coffee and tea are also included. The food quality is good and I enjoyed my meal. A great outing and all of us had a good time.Recommended

Superb service with a smile. A well laid out smorgasbord of western and local themed favourites. Food is well prepared and presented in Le Cruset crockery rather than the large silver containers which tends to be the norm in most buffers. So food was always fresh. The carvery had a delicious selection of roast beef and pork. For starters there was fresh oysters, crabs, cray fish, all freshly presented. For dessert, leave room for the bread and butter pudding! Coffee included in buffet. Probably the best buffet in town
5
Had an amazing English Tea at this wonderful cafe on my birthday, may 29th. It was actually impromptu, having gone there without making a reservation... So when i first arrived, i was told that they were full. I was a tad disappointed, but a little before i walked away, the staff at the counter mentioned that i cld try to come again at 230pm and try my luck to see if they have available seats from guests who reserved but did not turn up. And i did, and i was sooo lucky to get a table :))Selections of the fun-sized cakes, pastries, sandwiches were in abundance and delicious, beautifully placed in a three-tiered stand... Alongside free flow of coffee or tea - all for a mere $28++. Ambience was equally perfect and quiet, being a weekday - that made me enjoy my "me-time " much more. Service was impeccable, fast and excellent. I really had a great time. Thank you for being wonderful
5
My first visit to Marriott cafe dinner buffet on friday & it was worth it! Love the seafood(esp lobster, very fresh and sweet), customized pasta, desserts(so so many choices!), etc.Besides, the location is well located. Just a 3min walk from Orchard MRT station.The staff there are friendly and helpful as well. Overall, the food, money worthy and services are satisfying! :
5
I like this breakfast. There are various bread, salad, fruit... The chef made me the egg something and he talked me everyday. I made a good conversation with him. I recommend here.
5
Great choice of buffet foods - disliked having to leave!! Great alternative breakfast venue to the executive lounge and perfect location to people watch on Orchard road / Scotts road
4
I love the dinner buffet. They served a wide array of buffet spread. Love the seafood as they are very fresh. Desserts were delicious too. Nice ambience too. Worth the visit!
4
I really like their dinner range, esp that seafood bar. Desserts are not as impressive as their seafood range. And the place is very clean, staff is very friendly. I say save your stomach space for the seafood!
5
I've eaten here three times already, and by far my favourite was the lunch buffet I had here for my birthday. The spread was better than the two previous buffet dinners I've had here, including ravioli, lasagne, tenderly-marinated lamb shank, pork cheek, steak, roast beef/pork, and of course a whole selection of seafood, sushi/sashimi, dessert pies/cakes/profiteroles, breads/salad ingredients/cheese, tropical and temperate fruits etc. One not to miss is also the custom pasta section, held down by a friendly and obviously skilled chef, who will whip up a bowl to your precise order. You can choose your pasta (spaghetti/linguine/fusilli/penne), sauce (bolognase/cabonara, aglionolio, pesto) and a range of ingredients such as bacon, mushroom, chicken, chili flakes, chives, etc. On your birthday you can also get a free slice of cake, if you still have room for that.
4
Having eaten at quite a few buffets already in Singapore, I must admit this one impressed me for the sheer selection and quality of offering. The Salmon and Tuna Sashimi is very fresh as well as the Oysters which were my favorite. Roast duck and pork were also very good. Was also pleasantly surprised that they offered Parma ham too! The only thing that was disappointing was the Chilli Crab- tiny crabs with not so great taste. Note that coffee and teas are included in the buffet but need to be ordered ala carte. Price per head S$70++
5
I have eaten and relaxed here 30+ times over the years. Great Food and great service. Good outlook on a busy intersection alfresco with fans on the ceiling (Alacarte menu). Unfortunately the only thing I can say is if you order 'tea' it is very expensive. SGD9 for a cup of tea. Everyone should experience this place
4
Before we lived in Singapore, we had the opportunity to stay at the Marriott and eat at the Crossroads Cafe. Since moving here we have visited several times to enjoy a relaxing outdoor venue and great service. Mannan and others always greet us warmly and take good care of us while we are there. The Waygu burger is expensive but delicious and pairs well with Duvel beer (one of the few places in Singapore that carries it). Already looking forward to our next visit
5
Having dinner buffet with my friends on Wednesday The food was awesome!! Thank you to chef Daniel chef kenny chef junyi!! The service staff was attentive and nice!! Hostess ruth give us a warm greeting and the manager david and his team mogan myra shandy jack, gave us a awesome service!! Thank you to u all!!! Thumbs up!!!!!
4
Was there earlier this evening for the buffet dinner with 15 other colleagues. Thought the buffet spread was good, but servers were slow to clear our used plates. Fruit juices took longer than expected to arrive. One of our servers, Chai Lee, saved the evening by fulfilling our table requests. He is attentive to our needs, and apologetic as well. Good job Chai Lee, and hope it would be a more pleasant experience next time
4
Had dinner with my extended family. Food and service were excellent. Didn't come cheap though. Prices are steep but then again not nexpected. Good place for family meals as it has something for everyone.
5
Great spread in the buffet and the service was professional. Thoroughly enjoyed my time with my family during our dinner.
5
Great selection of dishes for buffet and a superb service! My family and I truly had a wonderful time!!
Thanks Jeff, Chai, and the rest of your crew!
5
The food here is nice everything was fresh with a good variety of different foods. I'm usually fussy but i can't say anything bad about this place 10 out of 10
I suggest trying the chili mud crab
4
A few friends and I ate at the Marriott Cafe for breakfast and it was very nice. There is a wide selection that includes breakfast abs lunch items of many different cuisines. The cafe being at a hotel does mean the prices are typically higher, but the quality is there to justify the price
5
As it has never been a disappointment, when a friend wanted to celebrate his birthday with friends from Kuching, Marriott Cafe Singapore was the obvious choice. The friend felt that his Kuching friends deserved nothing less. Our experience with Marriott Cafe Singapore has always been excellent but this time it got better. Because the friend is a regular and it was his birthday, a few crew members surprised him by offering him a lovely chocolate birthday cake and sang him a birthday song. One of them, Morgan, even brought him a banana split ice cream later as a special treat. We were thoroughly spoiled by the crew member's attention, excellent service and dedication to make the occasion perfect. The Kuching friends were so impressed with the quality of the food and service that they couldn't stop praising them. We would like to thank Chef Rudy for his superb cooking skills and crew members like Morgan, Jeff and Chester, and others, who made this particular occasion so wonderful and have consistently delivered to us value-added service. They know how to instill a sense of belonging among their regular customers
4
We had to make reservations and the process was slightly different from the other times: payment had to made first and a form had to filled up (I think). When we arrived a the entrance of Marriott Hotel, it was barricaded and only guests of the hotel were allowed inside.Once our reservation was found, we were banded and brought to our table. And so our feasting begin... The food was one of the freshest that I have eaten so far. There were meat, salad, mussels/oysters/seafood and Japanese stations (sushi and fresh sahshimi!). One special station at this buffet was the salad and bread stations: there were many varieties of freshly baked bread and salads (with over 15 varieties of salad sauces & over 20 accompanying condiments).For more on the experience and photos, please check out my blog: http://www.travelbytez.com/2015/01/new-year-eve-dinner-at-marriott-cafe.htm
5
We had a really great Easter Sunday Lunch here, the staff are outstanding, truly professional and super friendly. The buffet is top quality with an amazing selection. I definitely recommend eating here - I'll be back:)
4
This is my second review of this buffet restaurant and once again our experience is good. The food is of good quality and service from all staff is excellent specially Maro, Ruth, Chester and Chailee. They are friendly and approachable and very attentive to guest needs
5
The spread of dishes may not be as wide as some hotel buffets but the Marriott puts emphasis on the quality of food and the quality of service. Service staff Maro is very kind and she always smiles whenever you need her assistance. A good addition is the guests do have an option to have a wine buffet for 48++ which for me is a good deal if you enjoy having wine. the best of all is the King prawns and the lobsters. fresh and sweet and yummy down to last bite. If you are looking for value for money in a buffet, the Marriott should be on your short list. You need to decide and book early because I'm sure they can get fully booked very quickly
4
Ample choice of food from all corners of the world: from Asian seafood and sushi to English roastbeef, from Italian prosciutto to French bread...
Excellent quality, no limit to quantity other than decency !
Good service, recommend booking
5
Mannan made our dinner very pleasant and I highly recommend the sticky date pudding here. I felt the ambiance was relaxing and inviting
4
My friends and I came to Marriott Cafe for a buffet dinner and were attended by Ms. Maru & other staff (Myra & Ruth) they were very attentive to our needs. Ms Maru greeted me with a birthday cake with A smile. ( thank You :))Marriott cafe must be fortunate to have staff like them. Thank you for making my Birthday a special day
4
When it comes to buffet, the dessert section matters to me most! They serve a good range of desserts, from gelato to pretty looking cakes and tarts, and a small section of durian desserts (i.e. if u r a durian lover)! Food wise the spread was great too. There's a pasta counter where the chef will prepare your kind of pasta for you! Wine is free flow too, I guess that should explain the cost
5
We normally visit Singapore for business and I always make a habit to explore restaurants all over the country.I had a business meeting at the Marriot Singapore and decided to try their buffet dinner.It was a Saturday night and it was fully booked. Staff named Maro proactively approached me when she noticed that I am looking around. She is very polite when she offered assistance and advised me that the cafe is full house. What I liked about is when I turned around she ask me if I am willing to leave my number and she offered me a sit at the lounge and told me that she will put me on a waitlist and will call me as soon as there is a last minute table cancelation. She even offer recommendations that I may have at the lounge while waiting.After 30 mins she looked for me at the lounge and assisted me at my table. What an excellent experience!She introduced me to Myra and Ruth who assisted me all through out the night.The buffet is ordinary seafood and international mix. What is special is the service
5
I am reluctant to give a meal an 8 out of 10. So its rare to go to 9...but 10 out of 10...!!! Only on 2 occasions can I say that of a meal.Now to qualify this...I am taking about the meal only...not the restaurant, fine as it is. We did enjoy sitting outside watching the people of Singapore etc pass by....but really that is not the reason for visiting. The Hainan Chicken Rice was simply the BEST...EVER.The broth had flavour and softness, the rice was hot and full of chicken essence and life. The chicken itself was full, juicy and succulent.My wife enjoyed the Singapore Laksa very much...and gave that a 9...and as an experienced Asian cook, is a very tough marker.Will we go back...silly question really
4
went with friend for a business lunch. In fact it's a buffet. Everyone can be satisfied. I select small fried crabs, salmon, ham, chicken. The cheese looked not in good condition:). I did an orgy with dessert: different kind of cakes. Tiramisu was not the best. Anyway, the place is nice, everyone can find his preferred food
5
I was on a short vacation here in Singapore and I decided to dine in at Marriott Cafe during my last day. Myra welcomed me with a warm smile and she immediately led me to my table. Another staff by the name of chester approached me and assisted me with my orders. He was very friendly and accomodating. As i was enjoying my food (which i must say was very delicious), Maro came up to me and check how was everything. I really appreciate the kind of service that they have rendered from the moment i stepped in until i finished my meal. I would definitely come back and recommend Marriott Cafe to all my friends! Kudos to all the staff who made my last day in Singapore a memorable one! :
5
Marriott Cafe is currently serving Italian and it's as good as it gets, thanks to Chef Daniele Trivero and his colleagues. As a fan of Italian food, I enjoyed one of the finest Italian meals I had ever had during my last visit with a friend. Chef Daniele was just unbelievable! One of my favorite dishes was the meatballs, made from Chef Daniele's grandma's recipe. It couldn't get more authentically Italian! The fine dining experience was also enhanced by the fabulous service crew members such, as Chai Lee, Chester, Jeff, Morgan, Myra, and Shandy, all of whom treated us like VIPs and all of whom I would like to thank. They will not see the last of me so soon
5
We have been to Singapore of various occasions and nearly always come to the Marriott for our evening meal even though we stay at Pan Pacific. There is a wonderful buffet selection daily with a huge assortment of foods to suit all tastes and dietary requirements and there is a good menu as well if you would rather have a burger, noodles, fish or steak. Beef Ho fun is my favouriteWe look forward to returning there again soon
5
Kudos to Yazid and Mannon for being so attentive, prompt and helpful! We greatly enjoyed our evening. Will be back. Cheers....
3
We had only coffee. Coffee at 10d a cup, is ok considering this is at a hotel, but not really exceptional. Could have upped the quality of the coffee a bit or served it with a biscuit.
5
Great breakfast buffet spread included American, continental , local Singapore , Tim sum, breads and pastries and fresh coffee, one of the best I ever had in years. All the items was delicious, fresh and made a la minute
5
Excellent
Very good and fresh food
Westen section and asian, carving station also very good
Good Value for money
5
Fresh pancakes fresh bacon and fresh fruits .. Things I love and these are there in abundance in Marriott Cafe breakfast buffet ... Add that to the friendliest staff and great chefs and u really have an awesome experience ... Will surely come back
4
Today,My hubby and I went for the breakfast buffet. We were impressed at both the selection and service provided at the Marriott Cafe. The (angmo) chef who was making the omelette talked to me during my 2nd round of food selection. He noticed that we are Singaporean and he thanks us for supporting their breakfast. I guess most of the guests are tourists and maybe he seldom sees Singaporean who will wake up early in the morning just to have breakfast here. haha (whish is true to me)Food Cons: The bacon is abit too salty. Dim Sum can improve. :)Food Pros: The juices are great. mango ice-cream worth the try. Croissant is fantastic. Impressed by the service. Keep it up
5
I highly appreciate Mr. Lau Chai Lee for his extra ordinary effort. We were late for breakfast 20 minutes before closing. By understanding our situation, Mr. Lau strongly recommended us to go for buffet lunch, but it is fully booked. He took the trouble and asked for help from his sup. Mr. David. We got the place. All of us (my family ) truly enjoyed the lunch. It is really value for money. We express our sincere thanks to Mr. Lau Chai Lee for an excellent service attitude. I am certain with this attitude it will contribute to the success of Marriot Cafe. For sure we will come back for more of the food. Our BEST regards to Mr. Lau Chai Lee and Marriot Cafe
4
My friend use some 1 for 1 voucher hence it came to abt 21++ per pax which is good valueAmbience - relaxing and airy - high ceiling is a plus pointfood - selections are inclined towards Asian which is my cup of tea. Seafood included mid size prawn and good size oyster and some smoked salmon. good choice of noodles/laksa, porridge, salads and some dim sum. Nyonya kuehs are very commendable compared to the lighter selections of western dessert like sticky pudding and bread pudding. an assortment of french pastries/petits available. All in all the food is good, and they are definitely enough choices to keep us busyService - plates are cleared promptly

My company had their Christmas dinner here this year. The location was superb, of course (being right at the heart of Orchard Road). There was a good spread of food, however, the raw seafood was not fresh and the tuna sashimi was a bit tough. My company also paid for us to have the wine buffet, but when we arrived, even though we had a reservation, there were not enough wine glasses, and embarrassingly, we were made to wait about 20 minutes before sufficient wine glasses arrived (there were about 40 of us). Overall, I thought that the quality of food was of average hotel standard, and given the higher prices compared to elsewhere, did not perceive it to be value for money (fortunately, it was all paid by the company).

We were impressed at both the selection and service provided at the Marriott Cafe. Although the dining room was completely full, three different servers assisted us throughout the buffet.TIP: Make sure to stop by the yogurt and ice cream sections before leaving to enjoy a cool treat.Second trip: Enjoy a freshly-made strawberry banana smoothie. Wait until it comes off the blender and try a fresh smoothie.Third tip: By the exit is a bottled water and green apple station: two terrific things to have on the go while touring Singapore

I visited Marriott Cafe last monday and was sitted near the Java+. As i entered i was greeted by Terrance(not sure how its spelled) with a wide smile. He is very hardworking as he clean the tables and set the tables. Great person working in Marriott Cafe, I would love to come back again. Great food and ambience. -Mr Ta

i went to this cafe with my family few times, we always greeted by a warm smile from all the server. it's my 1st time to comment. A special thank you to all server that i appreciate.. ruth, mogan, myra, chai lee. but sometime when peak period the service will become very slow

My wife and I came to Marriott Cafe for a buffet dinner and were attended by Mr. Chester and Mr. Terrence. Both of them were very attentive to our needs. Mr. Chester greeted me with a birthday cake and Mr. Terrence has a million dollar smile. Marriott cafe must be fortunate to have staff like them. Thank you for making my Birthday a special day. :

 Last 120814 was my birthday and my wife's wedding anniversary and we celebrate it at Marriott Cafe for lunch buffet. It features a long list of interesting selections of food like oyster, prawn & crayfish from the seafood section. And I can't get enough of the Crispy Pork Saddle and my wife from sushi section. We also tried their pastries. Good for persons with sweet tooth. And the best of all we had a complimentary cake. An excellent service of Allen, Vic & David. They were polite & cleared the dishes & topped up water frequently. Overall we will come back again.
5
Great selection of foods! Great staff they serve with a smile! Ambiance is great, very nice & accommodating. We tried the laksa and pasta with cream sauce cooked by chefs on the spot by their open kitchen. Crispy Pork Saddle become one of our favourite its is soft and not dry. So many food!! All I can say is very delicious. We will come back again.

We had buffet breakfast at the Marriott Cafe this morning. The cooks manning the noodle bar and omelette station were very friendly, cheerful and efficient. The fruit bar and juice bar were well displayed and stocked. By contrast, the salad bar and the two plates of smoked salmon and marinated salmon looked rather awful. Overall speaking, the buffet breakfast was not bad, but rather standard and basic - with the exception of the fruit bar and juice bar which were really good.We agree with some reviewers that the tables/seats by the side of the street or near the hotel entrance could be quite noisy, hot and unpleasant. I would recommend seats further inside by the side of the Java+ or hotel lobby
4
Great buffet spread, would love to visit Marriott Cafe again. Great service from Rosie, Vic and Liz.My Wife and me were having our breakfast at Marriott Cafe this morning 6 Dec 2014. We were being served by 3 service staffs Rosie, Vic and Liz. We appreciate their excellent service rendered to us. Their smiles have brightened up our day. As today is our wedding anniversary, we were surprised Rosie and Vic presented us with a complimentary chocolate muffin to celebrate our wedding anniversary. Loved their smiles and brightened up our day
4
Ample spread to enjoy a buffet, Food quality is good. Meat were cooked to perfection and tasty. More fruits in the buffet would be nicer.
Service staff was attentive to customer needs.
5
It is my 1st time to comment a restaurant... Marriott café is awesome... I like the buffet they served n the service is excellent
Some of the staffs like mogan chai lee and Shandy. They give a very good services. We must be back!!
5
one of staff shandy the service is very good and polite and care of other. The food is very good The environment is good too.
5
Food and services are excellent. Staff are courteous and friendly.
Very good spread of breakfast, lunch, hi-tea and dinner.
Have patronized the cafe since 1998 and dined at least 2 to 3 times a month.
5
Best food. Nice cafè and the service is good. And the rooms are nice ambience. Marriott hotel is great!

The open plan restaurant, with seating right in the entryway, and the inattentive service staff detracts from a pretty good open buffet menu. Excellent raw bar and good mix of Asian and Western dishes. The "free flow" win selection is average to poor - leaning to the cheaper Chilean blends and at $48p.p during my visit is over-price. Then again the wine-by-the-glass at $22-30 each is highway robbery.Full marks to the chefs, the food was hot and fresh where it should, the carvery selection was good. They do need to train the staff on chicken/turkey to avoid hacking off great chunks of meat. Not likely to return, with many better choices in that part of town, but ok if your staying at the Hotel
3
Good food but buffet is $60 that's hefty compared to surrounding restaurants and bars. Marriott needs to rethink that marketing approach
4
Dined in this afternoon with my auntie and we had a wonderful lunch although the restaurant was pretty crowded and we only had bar seats left. We used an online voucher, but the service provided by Ben was excellent and was probably one of the best I have ever come across here. The food was also great with a wide array of food to choose from

I made a reservation through eatigo.com and got this awesome deal for 30-50% discount. As we were a big group (15 of us), I need to make inevitable changes to the booking due to the timing and availability of each person. Eatigo has no functionality to amend the previous booking (increase or decrease no. of pax, or change timing), but instead it only allows you to cancel and make a new reservation.When we reached Marriott cafe on 24 Nov, 12:50pm (my reservation was for 1pm lunch), we were told by this staff JEFFREY that I only made a booking for 2pax as I had made several cancellations. I told him that those were cancelled because I had made new ones. I showed him both my sms and email confirmations and JEFFREY said that it could be a 'glitch' in their system. Sorry, not my problem. My colleagues and bosses were waiting at one corner, standing, as there was NO AVAILABLE TABLE FOR US. It was very very embarrassing. After waiting for a good 10-15 mins, we were able to have the tables and proceeded to take our food. The buffet spread is good considering that we got it at a discounted deal through eatigo. There were 2 batches of my colleagues who arrived--we didn't reach the place at the same time. When the rest saw where we were, they just walked in straight and sat where everybody else was.When we were about to settle the bill, we were told by JEFFREY that there was a total of 20 pax!!! I do not know how on earth he derived at this number. I immediately said he has counted wrongly and he should change the bill immediately. After amending the amount, he said it is now down to 16 pax. But there were only 15 of us!!! JEFFREY said that I told one of their staff that there were 16 of us. Since when has this become the basis of charging customers at a restaurant?? It has become their word against mine. The problem with this restaurant (and with their rude and lousy staff) is that there was no proper system to track the guests coming in and out of the restaurant, or a dedicated staff to receive guests as they come. Or maybe because it was already past the lunch peak hour so everyone was just too casual about the operations. JEFFREY insisted that there were 16 of us and made me look as if I was lying. My boss said he is happy to pay for 15 pax, because 15 is all we were, and 15 is all I have booked for. In the end, JEFFREY gave in and charged for 15 pax without the slightest look of remorse or shame. He even made a remark, 'please be informed that we have given you 30 and 50% discounts'. Yes, because we would not have dined there in the first place if not for this discount. But because of this terrible and awful experience, no thanks, not coming back to Marriott

Tastefully Professional, Pleasant, and Attentive are Marriot Cafe's staff. A Big thank you to Ms. Liz, Maria for their warm hospitality and knowledge of food pairing and reservations, & Chef John Chye who Expertly transformed the sliced Steaks at request into A melt a in your mouth delight!!...Try it you can't go wrong. Thank you Liz,Maria & Chef John(Biblical it means Grace) for giving my mother Jacqueline Magnus a wonderful experience, HAPPY HOLIDAYS & A BLESSED MERRY CHRISTMAS
5
Have good varieties of food for dinner buffet. Hot and cold. Great service from the service staff especially Shandy Myra. Will definitely visit again. Thumb up!
4
Breakfast bar has something for every taste, and good variety if you are staying there several days. Excellent made to order smoothies. Afternoon tea is a nice option if you are looking for an early dinner.
4
The staff are efficient and honest.
I left behind a jacket and called them up. They helped checked and returned my call saying they would keep the jacket for me. Thank you Chester, Rosie and Veronica for your responsiveness.
5
We had afternoon tea there , a huge variety of cakes and sandwiches , very elegantly served , would recommend
5
The staffs give excellent service and the chef are friendly. The food is also quite nice as well. The ambience is cosy and good.i really enjoy having the breakfast there.
5
My friend recommended me to dine in at this restaurant and it was all turned out to a memorable dining experienced. From the entrance a great smile welcomes us. From the moment we sat the waiters Mogan, Chester, Chai Lee, Mika, was very attentive. The food was to the extreme delicious that everyone should not miss. The chef in the buffet was very helpful to informed us the menu especially the Filipino and one Indian(Im sorry that i was not able to get their names). Also thanks to Ruth for the cake she prepared for my friend's bday. They are all wonderful. Though one side of the area was under renovation, still for sure we will come back

Marriott Cafe Singapore is one of the few eating places that a friend and I visit regularly and I can't help writing another review about them. Their food, services and ambience are consistently good. Although the weekend has more variety (and hence more expensive), my friend and I visit the place on weekdays too. What works especially for me is their very friendly staff members. One example is Chester, who has consistently given my friend and I excellent, value-added service. Chester is efficient and very attentive to customer needs. The chefs, many of whom are from overseas or have international experience, are also worth mentioning. One of the best pesto pasta experiences I've had happened in Marriott Cafe. I've had pesto pasta prepared for me by two difference chefs, Italian Chef Daniel & Malaysian Chef Rudy, and on both occasions it was divine even for a shrewd eater like me
4
I was having lunch at marriott cafe with my family this afternoon. Everything here is just pretty good especially the services they provided. A server named Chai Lee had offered the best service to us and we really appreciate it! We will definitely come again 
5
The staffs that served me were very friendly and nice especially Liz , Rosie , Vic , Jolene and Thulasi . The hostess , Maria was quick and assisted us to our table without needing us to wait . The chefs were also very helpful and the food was great ! It is definitely a try *thumbs up*
2
The hostess table was empty when we arrived and two staff (filipinas) turned up after a few minutes. While one was checking for my reservation the other was chatting with her in their native language. This created a non-professional first impression, which was only made worse when we were shown to our table in a very cramped crowded dining area with barely enough space to walk (this being a buffet restaurant!). The hostess left us on our table almost instantaneously and we had to get the attention of one of the waiters to tell us what was included in our buffet dinner. Unfortunately, the entire experience just went downhill from there. The quality of the food was not one that I expected from a 5-star hotel to warrant the prices charged. Nothing from the seafood section (lobsters, Alaskan crab legs, oysters...) felt like it was fresh. Noodles and pasta station were not manned, and when someone came to help me, the broth of the noodles was utterly tasteless and the cook-to-order tiger prawns were over done. The dessert station was a mess. The fruits looked utterly disgusting. Never again
5
Very delicious. This can be seen from the fresh oysters and sashimi. However, Indian cuisine is not very authentic. Italian food was excellent. However the chicken rice is far cry from edible. It was too hard and dry.
5
Cozy place, delicious food and great service. It's one of the bests if not the best in the world. Thank you Myra for taking care of our table. We had a wonderful dinner last night.
5
Dined at marriott cafe for breakfast twice so far with my friends, received excellent services from the staff. Staff were very friendly and even engaged conversation with me and my friends. Will definitely visit marriott cafe again !
5
Celebrated my birthday here in Singapore and Marriott Cafe is one of the reasons why I will coming back! Great food, great and pleasant service! Staff are very courteous and accommodating. Don't miss this place whenever you are in the city.
4
We like the atmosphere there, laid back, easy going. Best tables are outside watching the Sunday crowd. Service always impeccable. Either go early or book as it is quite popular
3
I do love the service that staff provided at the cafe , they were prompt and helpful. But I find the seafood spread limited and they do not replenish same seafood as it runs out instead , substitute w another seafood. Unlike other buffets at hotels I had , they topped the same thing up. Do love the desserts though , can see that a lot of efforts was put into the dessert section. 160++ for 2 A and 1 C 's lunch buffet was kinda costly. I spent much lesser for a award winning buffet restaurant for 3 A and 1 C. Check out my blog http://ext-wanderlust.blogspot.sg/ for photos and a more elaborated review
5
I was having dinner buffet at Marriott Cafe with my friends last saturday. The food was awesome and the servers are very nice. One of them i think his name is Chai Lee was greet us with smile and keep touch up our table. I was surprise with this awesome service, my friends n i like it so much! We will be back! Thx Marriott Cafe!Thx Chai Lee
5
Just dined at marriot for their buffet breakfast this week with my friends and I must say my experience there is truly enjoyable! From their wide variety of food and juices to friendly staffs that made sure I had everything I needed. Definitely going back there again in the future! :
5
Ohh fantastic food and the ambience very nice Excellent service by mr david thank to himAnd the staff are ver accomodating they very attentive ... They always there if we need something or we ask something.... One of they chef cook for us a very delicious shrimp sorry i dont know the name of that food...
4
lunch for some colleagues and myself - all thoroughly enjoyed it. A good selection of almost everything.. fish, roast, curries, great starters, some delicious desserts and some fun items like ice cream cones too. The cheese board, a personal favourite for me was a bit limited on choice, but overall a good experience and would recommend for a relaxing, all you can eat buffet lunch. Service good, value good, quality good, selection good
5
They have a good service and food is nice!
Loving the food here and will come back again
Thx Marriott cafe

My partner and I recently stayed at the Singapore Marriott as we have done in the past. We dined one evening in the Marriott Cafe and we were very disappointed in the service. The staff were very slow to take our order and trying to get another drink was difficult. We waited for quite some time with our menu for dessert and decided in the end to not order any thing. I enjoyed my time there last year but not this year at all. The food was average
5
I had my engagement dinner at the marriott cafe. The ambience was great and the place beautifully decorated. It was the most incredible evening for as long as I can remember thanks to the warmth and hospitality of the Marriott staff! The food was excellent and were given complimentary dessert from Hazel (staff) upon hearing it was my engagement. An evening to remember for me and my family but made even more special by hotel staff! Thanks marriott hotel for a most memorable evening
4
To be honest, the cafe is pretty similar to most cafe areas in major hotels. The decor is nice yet nothing remarkable, but the fact the hotel really does have a quality feel to it means it is a pleasant place to enjoy a coffee or catch up on some work whilst having a snack. Even if not staying at the hotel it is a good place for a midday break
4
The buffet spread here is not as wide but good in quality. You can expect refined food that's cooked expertly. It offers Oriental cuisine to Spanish and Italian. The desserts section is good too. Service and ambience is good but might lax during peak hours. Overall, a 8/10 for this place
5
Me and my wife came to have a Dinner date last 25th of September to celebrate our 7th year Wedding Anniversary to Marriott Cafe in Orchard, we we're never wrong, the food selection is great, the ambiance is mild, cozy and the service is great!Thanks to Ruth for reserving our seats, Thanks to Chester and Jeff for being so accommodating and even asking us from time to time if everything is ok or if we need any help.The service is just excellent, I am very pleased and I would definitely invite my friends and refer Marriott Cafe to them
5
We just had our 7th yr Wedding Anniversary dinner at Marriott Cafe last 25th of Sept. and I never regret celebrating it there. The food was great and the service from the team was excellent. I would like to thank Ruth for the great seat she reserved for us, Chester and Jeff for being nice assisting us. We will definitely come back to this restaurant

I took my husband to brunch on a sat since i had just bought this app called "Entertainer"It offers 1 for 1 buffet deals at the Marriott.The manager there Kolin was very pleasant handling our reservation and getting us a really lovely table. He also showed us around the buffet line and introduced the various dishes and recommended the favorites.Experience was great as was the food and we would definitely come back again.
5
Shared one of the best meal we had during last weekend. The service is fantastic and the buffet spread too. The restaurant is quite busy when we arrived, we do not have any reservation but managed to get the seat after waiting at lobby. The staff there are friendly and really polite, special mentioned to Tulasi, Kollin and Rinni. The atmosphere here could be improve may be we don't use to see people here like to crowded around the counter and wait for the chef prepare food and some even inconsider to other to take lots of oyster. May be the chef or management could highlight each person could help themselve for maximum of 6 pcs of oyster at a time so other will not need to wait for so long, I managed to get my share after 20 minutes in our meal. Thank you again to Kollin and his team
5
Just wanted to comment the excellence service from the team and the restaurant manager which came up to offered us seat and allow me and my partner to have a peaceful yet comfort meal in a haze day. In Singapore for a short trip to follow our Grand Prix F1. Looking for a meal around orchard area after walk into Hyatt hotel and Marriott hotel, many restaurant was really packed and not really friendly may be we do not really dress to their standard attire, but Kolin the restaurant manager who informed us the restaurant is full but he can tried to find a seat for us even he never push us away by saying "NO", yet he are really humble to seat us in and offer us a refreshing drink before we even go to get our buffet, his really a service oriented person which I see now a day many service provided fail, not only to him but the team too I can see the lunch was so packed but they all still provide the SMILE on their face, specially mentioned to Vic, Lizette, and Kolin, hope I get their name right. The spread was excellence too I liked the Seafood section surprises to see Lobster on the ice during lunch buffet and the huge dessert counter, the priced are a bit expensive but the service has make up the most to compliment the entire experience. The only disappointment are some food not topping up promptly perhaps due to the heavy crowd that we see on that day. Once again thanks to Kolin and team for the excellence service as your has make our day, also thanks for guided us to the F1 direction.We will come back to Marriott Cafe Singapore when we are in Singapore again
4
We were accommodated with great service by Myra, Vivi, Herbie and David and chef Rudy.
thumbs up for the nice food and friendly staffs.
I will recommend to all my friends to enjoy the same experience I had.
5
Lovely setting with great food especially the oysters, lobsters. The dessert spread with durian puffs, trifle left no space for the pasta and the roast beef sadly
5
Brought my colleagues to have buffet lunch and it was my colleague's birthday. I called to make reservation and requested for a birthday celebration. It was really a surprise, 5 staff came and sang birthday song with a beautiful fruit tart. Sweet surprise for my colleague! Thank you Marriott.
5
Stopover Singapore and decided to find a place to have dinner with singapore friend. Visited Marriott Singapore the buffet restaurant for dinner, went there due to recommendation by my Singapore friend and never regret the good spreads of buffet and the freshly cooking station with chef prepare for you some of the food.Service was fantastic and very prompt, friendly and is very accomodating when I last minutes asked for a slice of birthday cake for my friend suprises, they served us and really make a good memory for the dinner more perfect. Specially thanks to the arrangement of the slice cake from the manager on duties can't recall his name (black suit with glass) and the staff who came to sing birthday song to us.
5
This place has one of the best variety and selections for breakfast. What makes the experience even more amazing is the staff. Very attentive and definitely makes you feel very welcomed. Being there for an extended period of time they even know your routines. I have been especially pleased by certain staff there such as Thulasi and Rosie. Good job everyone.Nas

Though we are not a big fan of buffets- I think we have tried most of them. This Sunday we were deciding between the new Lime restaurant in the new Park which everyone is raving about or revisiting the Marriott. My father was visiting us and he is quite picky about food, also I have always heard a lot about their chef Pinaki Ray so we didn’t take chances and went to Marriott. I am glad that we dd.We have a simple way of rating Buffets – if you go for seconds and what you go back for is not sashimi , poached or blanched food…. It’s a buffet worth its salt. Most Singapore buffets we just stuff ourselves with the salmon sashimi… well we didn’t do that here. Don’t get me wrong the sashimi, poached lobsters, cray fish and mussels all were there and very good too but so was the prepared food.We really liked the cooked salmon, fish fillet, pork, shrimps cooked with mussels, noodles. They has an amazing salad spread. Though my husband felt the desserts were too sweet but I totally loved the sticky date pudding and the chocolate cake ( simple chocolate cake – but so perfect). Yes I went for seconds.. Finally my cappuccino and my dad’s latte was perfect too. The icing of the cake was the service staff. The restaurant was full, but I didn’t see any tables with dirty plates… they were promptly removed . My baby girl kept dropping her cutlery and they were replaced soon after. I have hardly seen any buffets specially on Sundays having such an attentive staff.Overall, we were one happy and stuffed family

As a westerner living and working in Singapore now, I am often on the lookout for places to escape the craziness of city living. The Marriott Café is one of those places. My husband and I recently enjoyed the dinner buffet and found the experience to be particularly nice after a busy day of work. We love the fact that they not only offer the buffet, but also allow you to order off of a menu as well. (I highly recommend the lamb shank on the menu - tasty, falls off of the bone, and not dried out.) The staff are friendly, the food is delicious, and the atmosphere is revitalizing. We will definitely do this again
5
This was the first time we visited although we are Singaporeans. Happen to be celebrating our belated Wedding Anniversary lunch, i merely asked for a more private corner for the both of us. We were caught by surprise that at the end of our meal, they presented us a slice of cake with "Happy Anniversary" wording on white chocolate. Been in the service industry for more than a decade, this is the little gesture that will really touch our hearts and make us have a pleasant experience. The service was superb and when i had a special request to have some oysters baked, Chef Tan makes the effort to deliver them to me by asking me to get back to my seat as i was wandering around the buffet line! i hardly see this kind of service and most importantly they are all full of smiles and Marriott definitely impresses us and we will definitely be visiting again

It's my annual ritual to visit the Marriott Cafe to celebrate my birthday and it's no different this year.One of the key attractions (at least to me) is the oysters. Without a doubt, it's one of the better ones around.As i set foot in, i noticed the limited pieces of oysters on ice. As my wife and I took our seats, the oysters soon vanished and were replaced by mussels. Clear of the purpose of my visit, i did not start with my food and sought the waitress' help to check on the status of the oysters. After no response for about 15 minutes, the chef appeared with 2 baby lobsters and shared that they are OUT OF OYSTERS! The baby lobsters were specially prepared for me and they can offer anything but oysters. While i appreciate the service recovery attempt, i could not come to terms with how they did not provide something which is, to me, basic. It's like a hygiene requirement of the buffet. Had every intent to walk out if not for my wife who started eating. Eventually, left after eating less than $10 worth of food and experienced the most foul birthday in recent times.It's absolutely disappointing to me and i'm still disturbed each time i think of celebrating someone's birthday. Marriott Cafe is now last in the pecking order; for fear of their failure to deliver again

This is the first time I have dined in for Marriott Cafe Singapore on 24th Aug 2014 approximately at 06:30pm.I have encountered the fresh oyster come with a live WORM on the shell.My first reaction is to call up the Restaurant Manager in case of that could harm to my health or happen to other guests.However the answered from the Restaurant Manager was surprised me. He mentioned this is normal to see FRESH WORM on the oyster shell, that is harmless as long as you didn't eat it and normally they will not stick on the oyster itself.My question was did the worm contacted with the oyster or probably other oyster before, i believed no one can tell. Perhaps will that be more than one which I didn't see it and already inside my stomach?This is truly disappointing responses from a Restaurant Manager in handling for such incident.He did not apologize for the incident. Worm maybe normal appear on oyster shell (Need further research to be confirm) but that should not overlook by the chef. Regardless whatever reason it is, this is still not acceptable happen for a 5 star hotel
5
Do not miss this place for breakfast! A little pricey, but so is EVERYTHING in Singapore. This place has a great breakfast selection, make sure you get an omelet, great service at the omelet counter.
1
On 19-Aug-2014 my wife and I went to this Marriott Cafe for high tea. The food was terrible. The food, like the beansprouts, were not fresh. The beansprouts already turned brown but they still placed it outside for consumers to take. The food seem to be made in a slipshod way, and it leaves the impression that they were not sincere when making the food. The laksa didnt taste like laksa, nor did the mee siam tasted like mee siam. It was a really bad experience and i do not recommend eating there
5
Visited marriott cafe for a couple of times now and I have to say that I can't get enough of their breakfast food! It has a nice variety and really yummy too. Nice egg benedicts. Even though the cafe was busy on a sunday morning the staffs service was friendly and david took time to chat with us and made sure everything was alright. Thank you for the pleasant experience will def be back again!
5
It was an extremely pleasant experience from the moment I stepped into the restaurant for the dinner buffet. I was politely ushered to my table by the hostess Ruth and immediately asked for my drink of choice. Excellent and efficient service!The food was really delicious, and I especially enjoyed the pasta station where I could customize my bowl of pasta to my liking. There was a wide variety of food to choose from which was fantastic. Service definitely made my experience a memorable one. Was impressed by the attentiveness and efficiency of the waiters and waitresses (Myra, Vivi, Lizette and Riki) despite the restaurant being close to fully booked.Will certainly return for more in the future!
5
It was my birthday and what a surprise when the staff presented a complementary cake and sang the birthday song to me. The staff heard it from one of my friends and did it impromptu. What with the great food and the surprise my day was complete. Thanks Marriott you made my day and you can rest a sure we will be having more birthdays there

Just tried this for a family dinner at a discounted price of 40.40sgd pax. I must say for this amount of money the spread wasn'nt mediocre or put it this way, the quality of freshness is tip-top and quantity and supplt was endless and not stingy.For seafood lovers, the amazement stars with crayfish, crab legs, oyster, other crustacean and mollusk seafood. Then there goes the korean theme this month but the bibimap was almost untouched by any diners prefering over the korean bbq and rice cakes. Meats yes meat the galore the choice, amazing but too meaty aint good for your health. You have a spread from primitive cooking of roasts to irish stew, beef cheek stew, the hong kong roasts (which I find mediocre) and a selection of freshly baked breads. You also get those sashim and sushi spread together with a generous supply of gravalux, cheeses and salads but one dissapointing fact was the pasta corner where standards fluctuates and the squid ink pasta failed to appear tonight.Overall ambience was good, service rating at a average 7 since they take a while for you to notice where could they be but very hardworking staff please applaud and lasr but not least the desserts were amazing with gelato and pies and pudding. I will come again but do something about the pasta standards

Came here 2nd time for weekday buffet lunch as I have a one for one voucher. Had a bad experience dining before they renovate their cafe. So I brought my mom and my nephew here. Service is quick and staff are very kind to change my kiddo plate after he mess up everything. Food spread is fair. Not much Chinese cuisine as mentioned. Just when we are dining and chit chatting, suddenly there's a large flow of people which I believed is company lunch all dashed in for the buffet. Kinda disappointed as we diners wanted a quiet ambience. And we consumers have to queue real long for the food and also we need to wait for the chef to top up the food. I guess this will be my final time to visit Marriott cafe.
5
I had my family gathering at the marriott cafe on 22nd June . We were being welcomed by Kolin and his fellow colleagues at the entrance . I have to say that it was a really good experience for all of us as both the service and food was marvelous . I personally love the pasta and seafood section. Kolin did a great job in recommending us the wines for that evening . Whenever we needs some help, Kolin is there to assist us . We are all very thankful to Kolin for making us feel very comfortable dining at the cafe . We will definetely be back for our subsequent visits . Thanks :

Good varieties of food available. Seafood selection includes crab legs, oysters, crayfish, prawns. Nice and fresh although there used to be fresh lobster as well during my previous visit couple of months back. I like the fresh pasta station which serves al denta pasta to your choice of sauces. Dessert selection is great too ! Nice ambience and great service with smiles. Not surprising that it is almost full house. Do remember to make reservations first

Pasta, Seafood, Meat and Desser Section have a lot of good varities. The Carbonara is an exquisite, and the meat section...steak and pork tastes good too. This restaurant is located in the level and the hotel is just beside the Tangs mall where quite a lot of people passes by.The price is $80+++ for the buffet dinner which is quite pricey but worth your money
5
Breakfast Brunch at the Cafe is outstanding. I have never see such variety of food. Freshly sneezed juices, lovely pastries,Asian and English styles to choose from. Staff are very attentive
5
Everything here is to my satisfaction. The food is of high quality, as is the service and the atmosphere. It's truly fine dining.
5
Many Choices of foods item to go for it. Nicely and freshly presented to us. Servicing staff are prompt and polite. Except for the ice - cream counter if they can go for a better taste. Overall Thump up to them.

Wonderful, fresh selection, anything your heart desires. Excellent service and presentation. We absolutely enjoyed it.

My family and I decided to give this place a shot after failing to get a reservation elsewhere. The Marriott Café is located inside the hotel, on the lobby level. The café itself is quite large, with about three different seating areas, though I would have liked a little more space in between tables. The food area is situated in the centre of the café, and you’ll find all sorts of international cuisine there. In addition, just for the month of July, they are offering dishes from the Korean cuisine. Buffet lunch on weekdays cost S$55++ per person, excluding taxes and service charges. The buffet also comes with complimentary coffee or tea.Food-wise, there were a couple of hits and misses, which is to be expected. For the Japanese section, there was quite a bit of variety at the sushi section, which was good. They only offer two types of sashimi though, salmon and tuna. The cold seafood selection was ok as well; they offered prawns, mussels, crayfish and oysters. The oysters were really popular; they were snapped up as soon as they were brought out! As it was the Korean cuisine special for the month of July, they had quite a number of Korean offerings. While I stayed away from the spicy dishes, I was quite impressed with their glass-like potato noodles, it was really tasty! The only Chinese dish they served was Hainanese Chicken Rice, so if you’re more into Chinese cuisine, you might wanna look elsewhere. They also have quite a number of Western dishes. I personally liked their potato gratin, which was simply oozing with cheesy brilliance. I also like their spinach tortellini, of which I had to stop myself from getting more otherwise I’d be too full to try anything else! The veal liver was quite tasty too. The ones that didn’t impress were probably the chicken with thyme and the country pie. The chicken was just really dry while the country pie was a bit flat in terms of taste. I thought their desserts were the most impressive in terms of aesthetics and taste. They have about three different areas for desserts, which is honestly, quite an extensive range. There are too many to be named here, but overall the desserts were quite rich and decadent, and you could really tell they took the effort and care to prepare them right. They even bothered to embellish the ice cream! Kudos to them for effort!The service here is quite pleasant; the staff were quite polite and quite efficient in clearing plates and refilling your water. Overall I had quite an enjoyable lunch experience here, and I wouldn’t mind coming back for another meal sometime in the future. The desserts are totally worth it! =

Really like the food at Marriott cafe and I went there for dinner on a Sunday. A lot of varieties were available to choose from. I have to point out that the service was really good and the staff were very friendly, they also constantly made sure that our table were taken care of. Thank you Chester and Ruth for making our visit a nice one

On Orchard Road - the main shopping street for Singapore - on the side of the hotel facing the street - outdoors but covered and air-conditioned. Good for lunch or a drink whilst recovering from the shopping - mixture of western and asia food - my advice - stay away from the western - passable but not great. Good place to meet and get the lay of the land.
5
I would like to share my experience during Hi tea .. food and service was exceptionally outstanding! I also recommend to give a commendation to Chester who surpass my expectations in terms of giving an exceptional service. your an asset that they should keep. Beyond that I surely recommend your restaurants to all my colleagues around the globe to visit and try your wonderful hi tea experience !
4
I had the hi-tea buffet at the cafe, I must say the spread of the food is good and the choice is excellent. I must give credit to the staff for the excellent service but the last and not the least, the price of the buffet is reasonable. A must try
4
Had the buffet dinner and I was impressed with the quality of food. The area where they had the salads was impressive & great. Also the bread ''shelf'' was a good one where all breads was displayed.Seafood section has the normal range which had nothing to shout out. Staff over at the live station cooking was good. A range of Asian & western and other food was tasty and nice. Dessert was plenty to chose from
3
All 6 ladies had a great time catching up - kudos to excellent service by Kendrick who made our visit an enjoyable one. Prices are a little steep though esp for the coffees :(

It was 10pm and we were looking to fill our empty stomachs when I decided to pop into Marriott Cafe. As far as I knew, it was the only 24-hour cafe in the vicinity and we were within walking distance. We walked up to the hostess stand and stood for awhile before we were ushered to a table. I witnessed some service staff clearing tables without so much as looking up at us. We were being attended to by a pleasant service-oriented Vietnamese male team member, who took our food orders. We wondered what took our orders so long to reach the table but I figured that most of the kitchen staff were clearing the buffet counters. Eventually, the chicken rice and nasi goreng arrived. The chicken and rice, complete with condiments and soup, were presented in porcelain bowls and saucers on a platter that were so heavy that I imagine they give your biceps a workout just carrying them. The nasi goreng turned was a tad dry but the chicken satay was chunky and tasty. Dessert was the faultless ice-cream, one can never go wrong with that. I noticed a change in decor in the restaurant from the last time I was there. The ambience was cosy and modern, with tables spread out over a wide area to give the patrons a varied choice of seats. We will patronise this cafe again, but during the appropriate meal time to experience tip-top service
1
Had Hi Tea. While good quality was acceptable, the supply of food was not replenished or was substituted with poorer choice. Sadly this happened 1 hour into the buffet. Spoke to manager David who could not offer any explanation. No wonder patrons piled up their plates with food at the start. Unless you are used to piling up your plate or rushing through your food, this is not a place to enjoy an afternoon
5
Just passed by the large outside terrace, coming from the MRT-underground and - as I was seeking a more clement temperature - then entered the inside restaurant, could see the chefs prepare the meals in a very modern kitchen (no smell though!) to find myself in a cosy environment, luxurious but not excessive with clients chatting along in a relaxed manner. One has a great choice of dishes. I had a very tasty local dish, well presented and nicely served on a banana leaf. I appreciated the very discreet and attentive way I was served by the waiters and waitresses. Warmly recommended
4
We stayed in the marriott hotel and had drinks and a meal on the terrace. The drinks were cold and tasty. A small selection on the menu for food but what we got was very good. My husband had the chicken and I had the fish. It was very tasty and served within 20 mins of ordering. I would recommend it to anyone staying in Singapore. The ambience and service was also very good
5
My favorite buffet restaurant in Singapore. Splendid spread, excellent taste, warm service.Been her many times but my last visit on 5/23 was extra special as I had a post-bday dinner with my friend.As usual, food was excellent. But the staff- MYRNA made it all the more special when she presented us with a cute bday cupcake. That was really such a sweet gesture.We will definitely be back
5
My family and i visit the cafe every time we are in Singapore. The Cafe has great food and a fabulous ambiance. One can sit and look at the world go by. The whole feel of the city is experienced while you sit and sip on mimosas!Very nice and friendly staff! Whether you want just have a coffee or a full meal, they extend the same courtesies and never hurry you up!A Singapore must do
3
I visited my friend who stayed in Singapore, and she recommended me this place. We went there for brunch and coffee after shopping. The service is slow; the glass of water is dirty, and my friend felt so bad because take me go there on that day. However, we have a good time together but the service there need to improve
5
Have a gathering with some sisters during hi-tea. We all enjoyed the spread especially the nice combination of English and Local hi-tea items, specially the scones, pizza, sushi and local TeowChew porridge with condiments to choose. It nice to have oyster and prawns for hi-tea where most hotel do not have. Oh my sister commented the Greentea smoked salmon is really nice. Service is prompt and efficient. All staff are very friendly and helpful. Thanks to the manager for arranged a slice of birthday cake for one of my sister birthday, this was a last minute request as we so not know this sister will or not turn up, so glad the staffs came over to our table and present a surprise birthday cake to her and sang her birthday song. Truly thanks for making this memorable experience for us. We will come back again.
4
I like the cosy environment and there are a wide variety of piping hot cooked food. I had a great time with my friends, and there are 10 of us. The service is good, the food is yummy. My favourite, the different variety of smoked salmon & the crispy pork saddle
4
Very good selection of food, have fresh oyster , alaska king crab , few live station pasta , roasted item , noodle and good selection of dessert ... !!! Thumb up!!!
5
Never fails, staff very attentive and extraordinarily professional. I have been a regular for 3 years since living on Singapore and have only praise
5
A great place to chill out, have a very cold Tiger and watch the world go by.
As well, the food is pretty good.
5
Excellent cafe (hotel guests can take breakfast here as well) with good choice. Perfect for people watching.
5
Oysters? Check. Sashimi? Check. Gelato? Check. Almost everything I've ever wanted in a buffet. Go for it!
5
Never miss this attraction as you feel like you are right there on orchard street, amazing place to have your breakfast!! enjoy singapore sitting at the cafe
5
A small group of us decided to have a cocktail night and on hearing of the all night long happy hour at Marriott cafe on orchard rd, we decided to head there..and it turned out to be an excellent evening made even better by the very attentive Manan, who ensured that our drinks and food arrived on time and looked after us perfectly. Will certainly come back, both for the happy hour and great service

Marriot Cafe's buffet spread offers a surprisingly wide range of food choices. From Italian to Chinese to Korean... The cold seafood section obviously is a hit with the diners. I was disappointed with the taste of the crab legs which in my impression should be sweet tasting flesh. The few I took turned out extremely salty. I guess the chef must have boiled them in water with too much salt. The sashimi, cheese counter etc, were all alright. The hot food stations did not impress though. While the spread was good, the taste all failed to hit the right notes. The paella was terribly undercooked (al dente does not taste like that) and tastes nothing like the real deal. The pork cackling was tough and difficult to chew. I gave up after a while. What's really good though was the Chinese roast pork. The dessert station offers a wide spread as well and chocolate lovers will love the variety of bite size chocolate desserts. There is also an ice cream station which goes well with some of the desserts. All in all, its not a bad experience. My expectation for quality of food from buffets is usually not high so can't say I am disappointed
5
I stayed in a nearby hotel for a week and got a bit bored by going to the same place for breakfast every day so I came to try Marriott's breakfast buffet. It has a wide selection and the food is nicely presented. The usual stuff are there but they surprised me with an ice-cream selection too - rather unusual for breakfast. It's a bit pricey though as a walk-in guest. It costed SGD47, including tax
5
There are inside options but for the city buzz and atmosphere sit outside and gaze.The food is very wide ranging and all was excellent.We had sweet and sour prawns which were fabulous, a lamb shank which was a good portion too.The crab cake starter was tasty and the sauce delicious.The wine list is extensive and the night we dined there was a wine promotion which is a regular affair.This is not cheap food at c 80 s$ per head including wine but it is a fun place to eat and to be seen. The street bustle is all around and as an entertaining meal was hard to beat
4
An old stand-by for a quick lunch. The menu covers East and West and for the very hungry there is even a buffet option. Service, as to be expected, is swift and professional.
3
Hi,
Went for the buffet lunch. Oyster is the smallest I have came across. :-)
Prawn crayfish and salmon sashimi are fresh.
cheers
moncapu
4
food easy to select and good. Nothing complex. staff efficient. eaten here at least 2o times as always got a buzz watching the world hurry by.
5
after walking for a couple hours and eating at a food hall we had coffee and cake here then a liqueur here,great way to finish the day.
4
I have been to the Marriot Café for lunch a few times over the years, and always try and fit it in when I’m in Singapore. This time was no exception. I was glad to see that the fantastic buffet spread was still the same as always. From Morton Bay Bugs to lobster and from Korean Rice Dishes to Roast Beef. Nothing left to desire. This time we weren’t that hungry and decided on the a-la-carte menu. I had the Wagu Hamburger and WOW! I can only tell fellow travellers that it they miss this, they miss a lot. There is even a free-flow wine offer with lunch at a very reasonable price
2
Pros: Staff was friendly and promptly acknowledged our presence upon reaching. Food presentation was good, startled feeling hungry just by looking at the food.Cons: Service staff could do with a little more common sense, we had 2 families and 2 prams and toddler was asleep in the pram, service staff came over and asked us to leave our prams by the side and offered to bring a child seat... I was not impressed. I would've stayed away if I had known that the restaurant does not allow toddlers to slp in the pram during meal times.When my son woke up, I pushed the pram to the side and looked around for a child seat... found 3 and all 3 were with buckles that either was spoilt or missing, hardly a great "moment of truth" by a reputable hotel brand. My thoughts then was that cost savings are now more important than a child's safety, otherwise why have so many seats without the safety mechanism available in the restaurant?Went to the wonderful buffet counter and sight was all that was wonderful about it. Oysters (one of my favourites) took 2 pieces and decided never to touch it again, it was washed out so cleanly that you do not even know that you are eating oysters (tasteless). Sushi, the rice tasted as if there was lots of left overs from the night before and your chefs didn't know what to do with it, steamed chicken... I really thought I was biting into dried meat, until I had a look again. That's as far as I went.... paying over $40 plus per pax, you could have a feast with better quality food anywhere else in Singapore. I was seriously not expecting such an experience from one of the well known hotel brands in Singapore.Would I eat there again. Simple NO
5
You can measure a restaurant by the crowds and in this case the crowds confirm a top rating. I'm not sure I've seen a Marriott restaurant as consistently busy as this one anyplace in the world. Usually I find a hotel restaurant is my last pick. I'd rather select something else in the neighborhood, but not in this case. It's buffet style. Nice, broad mix of western and Asian dishes. Plenty to eat for any taste. The staff is excellent! Very friendly.

This is our second time having Marriott Cafe's high tea buffet since 2 years back and I must say, it's more or less the same dishes still as items may vary. Starting off with the seafood section, there were fresh white prawns and mussels together with bentos of sushi/sashimi assortment for the sushi lover.Mariott Cafe offers a bit of everything. From porridge, satays, dimsum to local mains like chicken rice, prawn mee, bak ku teh, yong tau fu, mee siam, curry chicken and more. We start to find it boring but I'm sure it will be a good take for tourists. Though the dessert portion seems limited, I'm still glad that they've a bit of everything. From ice kachang to Asian desserts such as kueh lapis, malay kuehs and lastly to English sweets. Being a high tea buffet, desserts should be the highlight of it but I find it disappointing to have such a small spread of sweets.The food quality for it's high tea buffet tasted average with plenty of local dish which I find it too 'familiar'. Overall, it's still worth a visit - $39++ per pax for high tea buffet. post, http://jacqsowhat.blogspot.com/2014/02/high-tea-buffet-marriott-cafe-singapore.htm

It seemed a perfect place to have a breakfast outdoor. They have many tables and choices of continental breakfast. But not on a Saturday morning. There were many tables of customers waiting long hours of service. Food is avarge in overall but slow service and expensive.
4
We've been going to the Marriott Cafe for 4 years, almost always for lunch (Saturday or Sunday). It is a great alternative to the extremely expensive brunches of typical 5-star hotels, especially if you go on a Saturday. The staff is very professional, the restaurant is kid-friendly, and you get a good selection of everything (seafood, sushi, cheese & cold cuts, salads, pastas, meats, fish, local dishes, desserts). I read some remarks about needing to refurbish the hotel - it actually just underwent some serious renovation works, during 2 years. As a restaurant guest, I never had the feeling that the place is old. Plus, it is extremely well located, in front of the Ion, and 2 minutes from the Paragon and Ngee Ann City. We always loved going there
3
Oysters, lobster, claws and shrimp were good. The rest of the cooked dishes were disappointing. The roast beef was dry. The salad was not crisp. Seemed like they were not fresh. There are better dinner food around town. Not returning anytime soon.
5
selection of cakes was amazing and coffee to die for - fab. you were spoilt for choice and can also get takeaway coffee if you are in a rush...
5
Wide array of choices from Asian to Western Cuisine. Great coffee and smoothies. Fresh fruits and salads were also available plus gelato!
4
Good value for the price. The restaurant is a little lacking in character but the buffet is varied and good quality. The desserts don't disappoint - especially the sticky date pudding! Worth a visit on a weekend.
2
the seating area looks more like a cafeteria from the 1960's than a five star hotel. Marriott needs to upgrade and renovate the entire lobby level. And while there are at it the fitness club is small, cramped and smelly. Do not recommend. This hotel is extremely dated, unfortunately.
3
Needed a quick lunch with local food with a hotel guest so opted for this. Ordered their "signature" chicken rice and fried noodles. The chicken rice arrived, together with, curry chicken. Huh? They later said it was "computer error. Double huh?The chicken rice was pretty bad - the chicken was really tough, and quite embarassing as my foreigner friend was really looking forward to it. The fried noodles was slightly betterMy soy bean milk was sour and i suspected , expired. I mentioned to the server and he said it could be because it was unsweetened. Triple huh? I had it sent back and told them there's a difference between unsweetened and spoilt sour. They returned later and profusely apologised, they must have discovered the expiry dateAt least they waived our drinks in the bil
4
I was pleased with the variety in the menu. If it gets larger it will impact the kitchen's ability to keep up. Service was slower than I would expect for the number of staff. The management does a very good job in assuring satisfaction, however, they must focus on training their staff to do the same. Trust and empowerment of staff is lacking. The quality of the meal was excellent and I look forward to more meals at the Marriott.
5
I went on a Sunday morning for breakfast to Marriott Cafe with family. It was one of the most pleasant breakfast buffet experiences I have had in a long time. The spread is excellent, the service extremely friendly (even though it was very busy), and the staff took time off to entertain my 5 year old (if you are at the egg counter with your kid, ask for the triple somersault omelette - your kids will love it). My wife loved the salad bar, I loved the meat section, and both of us really enjoyed the cheese spread and freshness of the croissants. The egg benedict is sumptuous and you must try it.........overall a great experience and we will be back for more!!
5
Happened to be at the breakfast buffet at Marriott Cafe on a Sunday morning in a group of two families. Loved the spread, especially the ham leg, melon and parma ham, egg benedict and freshly baked mini croissants. The meat was fresh and the juices were refreshing. The salad bar and the cheese spread was inviting too. Kids enjoyed the food and had a great time. Good food, good service and friendly staff. Have to go back to try the Asian section as we were too full by the time we reached there :-
4
Good spread and great quality with attentive service staff ever ready to be of service to you. Absolute pleasant dining experience in a five star cafe. Special mention goes to this young chef, Randy, who dished up a yummy squid ink linguine in cream sauce for me. Simple ingredients in prefect proportions making the ordinary dish an exquisite one. Congratulations to the executive chef too
5
In 16 days of breakfast buffets at 7 hotels, this was by far the best! Great food quality and huge variety. My favorite was the sticky date pudding. Wish we could have returned to try the dinner or high tea.
4
The cafe is nice and relaxing. But the tables were far to close for comfort! Food is normal hotel buffet standard. Service was quite good.
4
I liked the Salmon Sashimi, Fresh Oysters, Steaks & Pork Chop.
I also liked the variety of fruits : lychees and mangosteen
5
I love BF there, can find almost kinds of food you need, healthy drink of the day is very good idea and nice sitting area.
1
Not so good:- Buffet area is very small, irritating to queue. - Spread is very limited. We were expecting a lot of cheese to pair with the bread but there was NONE. Nothing exceptional in all dishes as in NOTHING. - Only one type of tea is served. - All the bread in the shelves were HARD. - The table has no placemats, tea spilled on the table while slicing the tomato because the table wiggles. - The surrounding feels like 1* hotel onlyGood:- Location is very near to Orchard MRT- Pleasant staffs- Got complimentary birthday cake, very tasty
5
At the corner of Scott Rd and Orchard Rd, the Marriott is sure to be busy, particularly on a Sunday afternoon.Initially, I expected it to be another decent quality buffet in a 5-star hotel but I must say that it was one of my finest buffet experience. First of all, almost all the dishes were presented in Le Creuset pots and containers, keeping the food temperature constantly hot. The salad bar had the most interesting selection of oils and vinegars and there were two different kinds of smoked salmon, one herb crusted. There were more than 8 kinds of breads and all were good!What stood out was the seafood paella, braised pork cheek, barley risotto, roast beef and more than 10 kinds of sauces and condiments, local chicken rice and there was an interesting array of Korean selections too with my favourite, the Korean rice risotto which is actually not unlike a chicken porridge.There are also 2 ranges of wine choices, either at $25 for Spanish Estrella beer and Argentinian white and red, or at $45 for another range of wines, all at free flow. The buffet was at $55 per person. For the quality of food and the good service, I think that this is a fantastic experience at a very reasonable price
4
I love the ambience and buzz of the outside bar and restaurant at the Marriott, and to us this a must-do in Singapore.It sits on one of the busiest intersections in Singapore on corner of Orchard and Scott's road, and is great to people watch, and to feel the incredible energy of this city state.Cocktails are fun, though they are not at the same alcohol strengths as in west.Food is a good selection of Asian, western and fusion, and whilst not haut-cuisine is tasty and interesting.The young staff are fun, keen, well trained and try hard to make it fun.I much prefer this setting and the a-la-carte menu to the buffet served inside, though Singaporeans do seem to love buffets, for all meals. May somewhat explain why Singaporeans seem to be quite a bit fatter today than they were 10 years ago when we lived here
3
Came here for a high tea buffet. For the price, the selection was very limited. Quality of food was hardly near that of any local hawker centre in Singapore in both terms of flavor and presentation. If you're looking for local fair, head somewhere else. Nonetheless, the ambience and service are still rather good
1
When I called up Marriott Cafe to place a reservation as stated in the website, i person called Ken answered my call. My group wanted to sit with each other but we wanted separate bills. Ken said he checked with his supervisor and said if we sit with each other, it will be put in one bill. Ok, then please put us on separate tables but beside each other. The answer was still no, because the call was for one reservation. So ok, i will just call 3 times so that we can have 3 separate bills. HERE IS THE ANSWER. Ok sir, but I will put the three reservations far from each other, is that ok with you? What the????? And to think Ken sounded like a Filipino. So I answered him in Filipino that he is not accomodating and it is not ok. And that I will not push through with my reservation. He just answered, ok, thank you for calling.He puts the hotel in a bad name, and he puts being a Filipino on an even worse reputation. Too bad, I hope Marriott reads this and change the way they handle such kinds of requests
4
Both my husband and I enjoyed the buffet dinner. Though spread of food are not as sumptuous as other buffet, quality of food is definitely one of the better one. We are especially fond of the desert selection. The only set back is that the crabs served were salty. Not sure if it is fresh from the sea or it soaked in salt water.Service good
4
This is a big call but this was the best buffet lunch I've ever had. Make sure you stop by on your trip to singapore. I highly recommend the Shepards pie! Amazing! Very big buffet selection!
5
Great variety of food but hefty price tags. Breakfast is around $82 for 2 but the variety and quality is fantastic. Take the coffee away for $5 or drink in for $11.
4
The food on offer is very good. Especially the smorgesboard. However this is hotel food and expect to pay more for it. Breakfast can be very expensive!!
5
Great location on the corner of Scotts road and Orchard road for a restaurant, sort of inside but outside as well. Very good service and great quality food at very acceptable prices.
Great place to watch all the people passing bye.
4
It is very rare that you get personal service during breakfast but the staff are very focussed and they attend to your needs perfectly.
5
Decided to try lunch buffet and realized that the food selection though less than the kingpins of buffet like The Line; but the selection is great! They were so attentive and nice to us.
4
It's very nice to sit outside in Singapore, out of the heavy air-conditioning. This is a very central location and a good place to rest between shopping malls. Expensive though, watch the prices.
4
This was the widest choice of food I've ever seen for breakfast. it caters for all tastes, and along with the buffet the quality was excellent, no restriction on how time you could top up your plate.However, it is very expensive. Breakfast £25, Buffet £42. But if you are hungry then it's worth it
5
This restaurant is located off the lobby of the Singapore Marriott Hotel, right on the corner of Orchard Road and Scotts Road. As far as i can ascertain, it is actually the same restaurant as the Crossroads Cafe, except that the Crossroads Cafe is the outside seating area, and the Marriott Cafe is the inside seating are. As we chose to eat everyday in the inside air conditioned area, I believe we technically ate in the Marriott Cafe. As guests in the hotel we had the breakfast buffet included and I have to say it was very impressive. The buffet had a huge selection of Asian and American dishes- everything you can imagine and some things you couldn't. There was a rotating selection of dim sum- very good dim sum by San Francisco standards- a noodle bar, Singaporean specialties, an omelet station, American breakfast items such as eggs, various types of ham, sausage, and bacon, a large selection of fresh fruit and yogurts, fresh pastries and breads. Everything was excellent. One day the pastry chef went from table to table offering fresh croissants to the diners. Right from the oven and delicious. Service was also excellent. Although most people had the buffet, there was a large serving staff present, and drinks were brought quickly, dishes were cleared promptly, and all needs were attended to. Without doubt, one of the best breakfast buffets I have had anywhere and it became one of the highlights of our day.
4
Dinner for my party of four on a Saturday was priced at $75++. I expected a big selection but was rather disappointed comprising mainly of meats. seafood selection was okay though the oysters had quite a bit shell fragments. The Boston lobster were tasteless and sushi selection very minimal. I also notice flies around some of the dishes.Compared to the Line at the Shangri la, it was a tad expensive with no free flow of juices either. These were priced at $10 per drink.Service was however pretty good and staff were very attentive even despite the large number of diners that night. Some of the food stations like the roasts however were frequently unmanned.All in not worth a second visit unless the change their pricing structure
2
was here for weekend lunch... Food quality just did not justify its price... it taste just like normal buffet... The seafood and sashimi just taste average on freshness, cooked food was alright on looks but taste average... Definitely not recommended...
5
A great location for just letting Singapore pass you while you relax with a refreshment! A wonderful buffet is being served.
4
Had breakfast today and it was 45SD. Thats a lot for a slightly above average breakfast buffet. Now mind you I did enjoy it but should be 10SD less.
2
I don't why I gave them another chance- not the first time food and service were poor and I have called the manager. The only good point is that it is owned by S. Tang next door- a place to rest when feet and legs are tired and taxi line is long.
4
Went for the weekday buffet dinner to celebrate grandma's birthday. Overall the spread was quite good- there's a variety of choices. Empty plates on the self-serve tables were cleared & replenished pretty quickly. Seafood & sashimi was fresh, the expresso gave a kick! Best dish would be their grilled beef. Flavorful, juicy, tender & just heavenly when accompanied with black pepper sauce. Desserts were fine, but the Bread & Butter Pudding is a must try. Remember to heap on the vanilla sauce :
4
The buffet food quality is superb. Seafood such as sashimi, crab, prawns are all really excellent. You can find also food for carnivores. In my opinion the roasted duck is very much worth trying. The selection is not the greatest in terms of variety, but how much do you need? The setting is a bit cramped, but at the same time it doesn't make the place feel too big. Service is good too, but the price is a bit on the high side (I don't know if it is different price for the weekend - we dined on Friday evening). Value for money is therefore only average
2
The location is very nice: you seat on a table outside and look at the continuous flow of people passing by the always crowded Orchard Road. This is funny.But in term of food... The menu is not very rich, the number of choices are a little bit limited.Anyway, I decided to have a burger with a draught beer. First it took quite a long time to have the food, secondly, when it arrived it was almost cold (and the beer almost hot). Luckily, the dessert, a cheesecake, was really good.But it is the bill the worse part: 70S$ (more than 50 euro!!!) for this dinner, out of which 18 for the beer. This is really too much! Never agai
4
It's not a gourmet experience, really, but if you're hungry and not in the mood to go out on the town, don't hesitate to drop by this ample & tasty buffet. You'll have an endless array of meats, vegetable dishes (choose these carefully to get vegetables that don't wilt under the lights), salads, pastas, breads, desserts, cheeses and more. The staff are eager and prompt. You can eat as much as you want

Waiting for an appointment at the Marriott with my 12yo daughter and thought we'd treat ourselves to their buffet lunch.Really lovely selection of Asian and western. Reasonably priced in comparison. Roast beef and pork with all the condiments, charcuterie, salads, seafood if you like oysters, Small crayfish (Morton Bay Bugs), big crab legs etc., really fresh sushi and sashimi. Desserts were brilliant. My favourite dish, sticky date pudding with caramel sauce with vanilla cream. Bread and butter pudding. Praline chocolates, creme brûlée, all the things that kids love like ice cream and toppings as well.$50 adult and $25 child. Total bill with one soft drink = $99. They will add about $36 for free flow alcohol which could be worth it if you drink more than three drinks. Happy to pay for the quality as it was a special day with my daughter but I really hate how they never advertise the full price, choosing to add on ++. This service and gst tax I don't mind paying but is really dishonest that restaurants in Singapore do not include it in the price, just the small print. My only annoyance, that and the fact we only had an hour to eat. If you go, give yourself a few hours. Will return there with the family

Went to try the dinner buffet with my family last Sunday to celebrate an early father’s day. It was really worth the price with the online deal that Alldealsasia offers. It cost only $53 for a hotel buffet. The deal is valid for Sunday- Thursday. Unlike other hotels’ buffets which usually cost more during weekends, this deal is also valid on Sunday which make it really awesome since my family day falls on Sundays. http://www.alldealsasia.com/deals/marriott-cafe-dinner-buffetFoodTheir must try dishes is definitely the drunken prawns, oysters and crispy pork saddle. When we step into the café, we were overwhelmed by the wide varieties that the buffet offers. My dad was especially excited with the unlimited flow of seafood. Their oysters are fresh, huge and juicy unlike most of the other buffets. We also ate quite a lot of chilli crab which would have cost us a bomb if we weren't eating this buffet. ServiceTheir service was really prompt. They cleared my dirty plates every time I went away to source for new delicacies. Overall, it was definitely worth the price with the vast selection of quality food available. Hope the deal last for some time so that I can go with my friends again

Anything you may desire from a buffet you can find it at this premises. There is a great selection of any kind of food you may want. Sushi, ham, salads, pastas, grilled meat and many more!!! Have a try!!

Found a deal on this buffet offered by AllDealsAsia.com http://bit.ly/Lm70iXThe spread was adequate but the quality of the food was excellent. The seafood bar was stocked with oysters, crayfish, crabs and prawns, which justifies its above-average price tag. A pleasant surprise was the meat section (most hotels offer generous portions of meat but they're usually tasteless): the pork saddle was roasted to perfection. I also liked the local food and dessert section. Yummy! Must-tries:1. Oysters 2. Crayfish3. Crispy Pork Saddle with Pancetta Prune and SageHighly recommended :

We sat down here for lunch; beers were $10 singapore dollars, lemonade was $7 and a cocktail was $28. We ordered lunch but it never arrived. After questioning the staff, the waitress had forgotten to put it through. We asked for the bill but they did apologize and gave us our drinks for free. Give this a skip, plenty of other places to eat..

I am a Marriott Gold Card holder and was given a complimentary buffet for 2 at the Marriott Cafe. So I decide to try it out today with my spouse and 4 year old daughter.Arrival - Reservation made at 12pm. Seated at the dot. No long waiting neither confusion.Service - Why service is impeccable?Plates were cleared quickly but not intruding. You know something we could have service staff hoarding behind you and even before you could lift your hands theirs are already on the plate. You won't get this here in! In fact they clear it immediately when you leave the table to get more food and when you return... your previous soiled plate disappear. Staff are always around to offer assistance. In fact my daughters personal utensils were offered kindly by the service staff to wash it and return clean and dry.Only one thing - the ice water was not top up during my whole sitting. And table setting without table cloth is kinda uncomfortable when we place our dishes. Rather cloth napkins were given.Food- BuffetIt was spanish theme and therefore you will find paellas and other spicy spanish dishes. And I found nothing for my 4 year old daughter to eat. There was a cooking station making Handmade Noodles, but due to the allergy to gluten, she could not take the noodles. Requested for something else, the chef at the station offered kway teow!!! so 1 points to service by the chef. Still my problem was my daughter, the kway teow soup taste bland and she was almost gonna to have bread and butter (sad isn't it at a Buffet restaurant on a weekend and nothing for her) that I met Executive Sous Chef Christopher Smith who was managing the Flame Brandy Prawn Cooking Station who after a chat with me organize a cream sauce pasta for my daughter. Absolutely perfect and she was happy! and I could continue eating.Food variety as mentioned was lacking and slightly disappointing. But for those who like cold appetizers plenty of sashimis, cold alaskan crabs, slipper lobster. Sushi served as a bit hard due to the rice as it could have been sitting on the line for long. Nice range of dessert, the pear tart was delish. Hot food was ok, as mentioned spanish theme but you will also find a nice range of local dishes such as chicken rice and other asian cuisine.Craving station - Lamb, Beef and pork. However there was no mint sauce for the lamb? Rather puzzling. but 4 jars of different type of mustard. Overall food - acceptable but not perfectOverall experience - positive. Chef Christopher Smith just made everything ok and the non-intruding service staff.However when coming to bill, the service staff said that I should have just pass them the voucher instead of asking for the bill, but I ASK THE COUNTER SHOULD I GIVE HER THE VOUCHER FIRST. SHE SAID LATER!ANyway, well done Marriott your service is impeccable

A wonderful location, if you have and can spend time there. Enjoy the wonderful, freshly cooked local dishes (like satay, fried noodles,) or their tea-time tit-bits. Savour their savy and sexy-named cocktails,prepared the way they should be done. While your time as you watch and enjoy the sights and sounds that pass you by, but package yourself well, as you will also be enjoyed by what that passes you by

We’ve been to Marriott Café a few times for the lunch buffet and the high tea. The lunch buffet is ok value for money considering that it includes oysters and lobster. There is also sushi and sashimi but the quality of the food could generally be a bit higher.The high tea is however a real disappointment. It is geared towards local Singaporean tastes rather than what a Westerner would associate with a high tea (think laksa, prawn mee, Teochew dishes, etc). They are not even letting guests select from a variety of teas but instead walk around with standard brews of coffee and tea. We asked for Earl Grey tea but they said that was not available. It was only after insisting on this that it was finally arranged.Overall, we’d expect something better from the Marriott

I did a brief summary in my stay. Very tired and decided to eat in.Chinese New Year -- so thought food should be good.Buffet has lots of choices.Price is OUTRAGEOUS -- 75USD basic. You want beer or win pay much more. But it is unlimited so you can pig out.They had lobster and oysters that evening.The Oysters had that slimy non fresh taste. (we love oysters)Other dishes were standard buffet fare.Desserts were nothing special -- standard cakes, ice ceam etc

We had a burger and a salat - the food was excellent, they served quickly and with a big smile....a very nice experience in the middle of a busy day! Enjoyed the friendly and relaxed atmosphere. We will be back :)

My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed ourselves in Marriot Cafe. It felt cosy and the spread of local specialties was to our liking. I had an overdose of salmon sashimi that day.

The food quality is rather poor, the service very slow and unprofessional and the price astronomically high.
A classical tourist trap. Only the location is perfect. Avoid it.

I stayed at the Marriott and discovered this lovely cafe over breakfast with a friend , love their omlettes and breads! its nice informal and has an open and friendly feel to it. Will be back for more soon!!

Nice place to sit after you have been shopping.Peoplewatching.Great chinese or international food.One of the places to sit in the evening for dinner or just a few drinks.
You can sit by the bar or have a table.Nice and cool in Singapore weather.

Went there twice recently for the dinner buffet. The cafe is under renovation and is relocated to the 2nd level. At SGD60++ for Mons-Thurs weekdays and SGD65++ for Fri- Sun, the buffet does NOT provide good value. The "expensive" stuff are sashimi salmon, crab legs, cray fish, prawns and roast beef. There is a selection of salad and desserts. Plus points for the restaurant? The free flow of fruit juice, individually brewed coffee and tea and the attentive service

I went for the high tea at the cafe on 2 Oct 2011. I ordered bowl of mee siam, to my surprise, the chef does not the difference mee siam and curry gravy, moreover I have placed the bee hoon (orange color the type of ber hoon for mee siam) for him to pour in the gravy. A 5 star hotel chef can't even recogonise the type of bee hoon. Is really a shame!!!!!Furthermore, my family felt that his altitude is very bad, did not apologize, raising his voice went ask for question on the ingredient

Went for the buffet dinner before it was renovated. Service was excellent. Food, not that great variety, cooked food the usual fare, nothing fantastic, seafood is ok, but I love that they have this crustacean yappies, which is just full of buttery goodness. Oysters are fresh, but they are rather slow in refilling n you see people loitering ard the seafood section waiting for the oysters to be refilled.The roast beef, I got to say, is fantastic! The mushroom sauce complements the beef well. N there free flow of cranberry, lime , apple juiceI'll visit again, if they still offer the yappies, roast beef n juice

I was very surprised that when I ordered a burger they suggested that it be cooked well done. I told them that I prefer medium or medium-well as I don't like the taste of a charred burger. The first one they brought was burnt beyond recognition. The manager apologized and had another one made. This one was charred outside but raw on one side and well done on the other side. It was unedible (to me anyway). They did not apologize for this and would not comp me for the burger even though I did not eat more than 2 bites of it. Very disappointing and I would stick with the local cuisine if you decide to eat there. I won't be going back

I have been there a few times before, tried the buffet, fairly good spread. Recently, just last week I have been again, we ordered ala carte. The service was really slow, I guess it was Friday night and it's emphasis is mainly on serving buffet. The staff are fairly friendly, but most of them are inexperience. Asked about recommedation for wine ..... need to check.... already took a bit of time already..... so I just ordered without any recommendation. Food standard is a bit disappointed too. It took more than 1.5 hour to finish our dinner, just ordered starter to share and main course.......not we were slow eaters.... Maybe it was a bad idea to go for ala carte during weekend...
