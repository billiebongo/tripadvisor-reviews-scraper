I've tried pretty much all the dishes they have here and none have disappointed. My pain point: service is bad, have to go to the counter to order even though theres plenty of staff and they refuse to serve tap water.
4
Indoor seats are quite limited, so I would recommend booking early if you want the indoor seats. The salted egg chicken was great, but the durian waffle was nothing to shout about.
5
The Shrimp paste chicken on waffles and the fruit teas were out of this world. Totally love them! We were sitting right below the sound system so we found the music a bit too loud.
4
Aburi broccoli was good, together with the roasted salmon. Salted egg burger was a disappointment. Cosy cafe for a quiet date
3
Ordered the chicken waffles and pulled pork fries. The food was average so I'm not sure why there's a hype about it. Interesting deco and concept for a local cafe though!
3
The place wasn't crowded but the food service was very slow. The salad was slow, the main was slow, the dessert was slow.
4
Had their mentaiko catfish burger which was not decent, would have been better if there were more mentaiko sauce. Food on the menu were rather pricey though.
3
I had seen a few bloggers recommending this restaurant and was so looking forward to visiting it soon. Finally, I arranged a catch up session with my friend recently. And I thought the research we had done should be good enough for us to select the yummy food they serve. But, to our disappointment, the menu has changed and very different from what the bloggers had posted. The high expectations we had on the food had led us to a greater disappointment. It would be just good enough to try it once. The service staffs were quite friendly and nice though
5
I love this place as they are being creative with their menu and dare to create something by mixing western and asian style / taste that have polar opposite in everything but it worked, wonderfully!!Having moved away from Singapore in late 2015, Sin Lee Foods became my must go to place when I returned to Singapore in 2017. The food still amazing as always
3
We ordered Fried chicken and waffles and Duck & Duck. Honestly I think the chicken and waffle was too ordinary, in fact I find the chicken a little too hard. This dish is overpriced in my opinion. The Duck & Duck, which is a very popular dish there turned up better but the presentation is not that good and the foie gras didn't taste fresh. A little over-rated in my opinion
5
One word. AMAZING! I don't know how they came up with it but it was sooooooooooooooooooooo good! I had to eat it very slowly to just enjoy the taste of the broccoli! I really indeed wanted more!
4
Went to SinLee with a group of friends; food wise hits n misses, their best dish had to be the aburi brocolli.
3
Was really disappointed by the famous salted egg yolk burger, served cold?? Wouldn't spend my money on it again! Broccoli salad made up for this place and the Korean chicken rice bowl was decent.
5
The spam fries and the salted egg yolk sweet potato fries are ridiculously good. You can even enjoy your food with a selection of craft beer. A bit hidden but not that difficult to find. I strongly recommend this place to food lovers
5
The menu looks very interesting, but after trying it out, I would say the combination of flavors are remarkably good. For its price, the portion are unbelievably good as well.
It has got high chair for young kids too, so would definitely recommend to friends.
4
Didn't know the menu I saw online and the menu there is different. Ordered chop and eggs but didn't like the tonkatsu sauce on it. Appreciated that the chef came out to check on us when I accidentally commented too loudly on my order (:
4
Not sure why it was not crowded with only us and another group on a weekday lunch. Wouldn't say food was fantastic considering it won best cafe, but decent. Price is slightly steep for some dishes.
3
I think I went in with extremely high expectations because "Chope Best Cafe 2015/2016" and all. The staff were great, and allowed us in even though we were late for our reservation. We got the Salted Egg and Mentaiko burgers - portions were huge for 1 person (which is good = value for money!) but I didn't think it was really special - sauce was okay, chicken was okay, bread was okay. We both felt queasy after a while so I think it is best to just get 1 burger meal and share it. I don't think I'll come again cos of ulu-ness and the food being rather meh, I mean there are many other cafes in Tiong Bahru that I feel are more worth the travel down
3
While I didn't order their signature chicken and waffles, I had other recommended items like Salted Egg Sweet Potato Fries ($12), Sin Lee’s Breakfast Chirashi Toastie ($23), and the Duck & Duck ($26). The sweet potato fries were not bad, but the duck and duck was slightly disappointing. I didn't like the foie gras - it was way to creamy and greasy i felt like I was just eating a piece of fat and couldn't bring myself to finish it. I went there on a pouring day so it was quite a hassle for us to get there - we ubered from Tiong Bahru Plaza, and the driver had a hard time finding the right place to alight us without having us get soaked. The atmosphere was all right - different from your typical cafe but I didn't particularly like it as it felt too cluttered.
4
Weekday reservations on chope allows u to get the mentaiko burger at just $8, UP:$14 which is a worthy deal, considering most of their other mains are priced at $20 or more! The mentaiko sauce was creamy with a pleasant savoury umami flavour coupled with a huge slice of deep fried catfish filled that had a crisp and crumbly golden brown exterior! Portion is indeed huge and filling for one. Also ordered the Nutella and peanut butter waffle that came with berries, brûlée banana and a scoop of ice cream that had a crisp exterior and a soft, fluffy interior. Though prices are slightly steep here, the quality is well assured
2
Although I'd made a reservation thru Chope, there was no table reserved for us when we arrived.
Food took quite a while to be served, and the dishes were just average.
4
Loved the food and the rustic ambience. This is my second visit here and I realised the change in their menu. The warm durain cake is yummy!
5
Tried the signature chicken&waffle, and Salted egg sweet potato fries, all taste great, even though i'm not a big fan of shrimp-paste flavor for the chicken.
4
Great service with unique dishes though the pricing is on the high side. Nice, hippy ambience in a quiet neighbourhood.
3
Expectations were set too high...
pretty standard cafe grub...
nice to have a changing menu but we missed the famed burger..
4
2nd Visit here, and the broccoli is still as awesome.
Pleasantly surprised by the Mentaiko Salmon Udon. Very tasty.
Tables are abit sticky though.
4
Non conventional and interesting menu. Indoor seating was not very comfortable though- tables were sticky and air was warm.
4
Second time there and went on a weekday again. Sin Lee has a dedicated menu specifically for weekdays, which changes frequently, and the prices are very reasonable. Suggest to head there on a weekday to try out the weekday menu first if you're unsure
4
Foods served promptly and taste reasonably well. Salted egg fans should try! It's less than 10 min walk from the station.
3
Maybe I have too high expectations on this cafe with the reviews and advertisements going on social media. I don't really like the food that I order. It is just average.
3
Plain water is not being served (be it free or purchased) in this cafe/restaurant, which in my opinion is the most basic thing every F&B restaurant should have. Even though no GST & SC, price of mains are above $20.
4
the service and the food is good will go back to try other in the menu... one thing is need to wait for the food quite a while due to alot of ppl
1
Aside from the peaceful locale, the food was either overcooked or plain disgusting. We ordered 3 dishes and every one was bad in some way. A tad overambitious an attempt into fusion cuisine.
The only saving grace were the drinks and air-conditioning.
2
The cafe's overrated. Food was pricey and not worth the money. Pictures online are deceiving. Try it if you have spare cash. Otherwise, don't bother.
4
Is our first visit to Sin Lee Foods as we just like to have something out of usual stuffs for a Saturday night dinner.We ordered their Pork Chop is was slightly hard to our liking and it would be great to have a small portion of rice or some potatoes to go along. However our favorite for this visit is their Japanese Curry Rice! Not those overly spiced type and is just yummy melted cheese with fried fish!We definitely be back for more
5
Food was quite ok. Especially the sweet potatoes fries with salted egg. My wife ordered the speciality which is the fried chicken waffle, which I rate 9/10 too!!! Shop space was limited. Still manageable with 1 kid, but I don't think we will do it with 2 kids. Parking at HDB carpark
3
I've been to sin lee twice, but i have to say the food's slightly disappointing this time round. Apart from the aburi broc salad, everything else was plain meh. Like what you can find elsewhere, but at a higher price. I really love the earlier menu. Also, if plain water could be served it'd be an added service
1
location was very hard to find, rather inaccessible. and during my visit, surprisingly quiet, there was no one in the restaurant besides us. and that they kept emphasizing online that the place need to make reservations so i thought the cafe would be busy and crowded but it was totally the opposite. so i actually did rang up to make a reservation when i was going there in another 2hrs, the person gave a mock laugh and told me 'no need reservations la, can just come anytime. we are not busy' wow. had high expectations for their 'fusion; food but it turned out bad. not worth the money and the meal had to ended off without the 10% discount that was supposed to be given during the CNY period. fantastic job sin lee food, never coming back
1
I came across sin lee food as quoted best cafe in 2016. So i decided to head down and give it a try. They have their salted egg burger which i wanted to try. So i went down with my gf on 25th to celebrate our anniversary. First thing they told us is that salted egg burger was only valid for weekdays. Kinda disappointed as it was not stated in the chope menu. So we order the pork chop and beef. The food came and plating and apperance was not appealing at all. My gf tried the beef and felt nauseous after that and vomitted out. It was a disastrous lunch date ever.
3
Nestled in the quaint Bukit Ho Swee neighbourhood, Sin Lee Foods took the space of what used to be a popular Lor Mee stall. We ordered The Aburi Broccoli Salad, Japanese Curry & Catfish Claypot, Duck and Duck, and the Aburi Mentaiko Burger. Both the Curry and Duck were decent, though the Foie Gras from the Duck bowl had a cold centre. The Aburi Broccoli was delightful and would appeal to non-veggie eaters. What fell way below expectations was the Aburi Mentaiko Burger. The pulled pork came out cold. When we highlighted it to the staff, they replaced it but it made no difference. Was it supposed to be like that? Really disappointed and regretted not trying the Salted Egg Burger instead, maybe that would have been better
4
Great innovative menu items and some of the items are reasonably priced (while some more pricey) ambiance could be more comfy though!
4
Love the salted egg burger, one of the best! Maybe they can consider adding more varieties for appetizer or side orders!
4
Nice embience, quality food. Good choice for meal with friends. Affordable price too. Value for money(:
4
Food was pretty good, had the aburi burger with generous servings of sauce. Portion size is just right for one grown man.
5
Hi !!! The full story below but I will just go straight to the main points now . Sin Lee Food is a cafe . The Food was great I ordered the Japanese Curry&catfish claypot and also the Yakiniku Beef Sliced and Braised Bowl !! Awesome the best meal so far specially the Japanese curry for those who have a thing for Japanese food or creamy food this is it. The place is rather small. But comfortable enough . The prices are expensive but worth it for the taste. Service are great ,fast and friendly . This is one of the cafe I really enjoyed their main course . So as for the full story I was going on a date with my gf and when I was planning ,I came across this cafe ,Sin Lee Foods! It's was a risk as there are bad and good reviews about this place .But it was the most convient for us so I took the risk and booked seats there. When we reached it was hiding and doesn't look much but the food they served is another story. Don't judge by its appeares very nice environment too overall their food totally won me over ! Go check them out
2
Prior to my visit, I rummaged through multiple reviews and most mentioned that the food served there was overpriced. Nonetheless, I made the trip to much regret. The pork chop was served with plum sauce and ketchup ($22). The broccoli was decent but I don't think it justifies the $13 price tag. Moreover, the location was pretty heartland-ish so I didn't think that they should have that kind of prices, especially since the food was way below average. Definitely wouldn't visit again, unfortunately
3
First visit and frankly we won't be back. We came with high expections and left with unhappy tummies. The spam fries tasted dry and bland. The beef and grains dish....tasted mediocre with the beef being too chewy and way too soft. The pork chop was tender but the sauce is simply too sweet to stomach. With the high price tag per dish, we were expecting more but unfortunately it failed our tummies. Overated food
4
After our last visit 2 years ago, the food that we had was still so good. The broccoli was still one of the most interesting dish on our table as it brought back memories of the last visit. The main courses of duck and duck and grandma's skillet pork chop all are done using the western food method yet infused with the tastes and styles of the local flavors.
2
The table is really sticky that I couldn't pick up my receipt paper with one hand. The bench is dusty that it leave powdery stains on my pants. Maybe it's all part of the rustic design, but it's not for me. Food wise the pork chop is bad because it's really sweet. Broccoli salad is nice and they don't serve water at all. Cash and nets only
2
Great service and pretty food but food was not up to our liking unfortunately! Friends and I agreed that it was pricey for its portion too. Sweet Potato Fries with Salted Egg was a great idea! But unfortunately didn't taste as good as it looks. As much as I'm a salted egg fan, the flavor here was a little overwhelming, and it turned the fries soggy very quickly
5
The aburi broccoli salad stood out the most among what we ordered and we were impressed. The scrambled eggs in the chirashi toastie were fluffy and soft. Unfortunately (or otherwise) they were the best part of the dish. The waffles were crisp and delicious.
2
Food is nothing fantastic Nor exceptional and is highly overpriced . Will not recommend or go again.
4
We ordered mentaiko pork slices burger and salted egg chicken burger for our brunch and was pleasantly surprised how good they were. Great find in a quiet neighbour, only complaint is the eatery do not accept credit card.
1
Worst meal ever had. Salted egg burger take a bite den dun feel like eating again. Very dry! The salted sweet potato fries became soggy fries! Over charge!!!
4
Had the chicken with waffles, salted egg sweet potato fries, aburi broccoli and the duck duck bowl! aburi broccoli was delicious. servuce was great!
5
Second time here as I really enjoyed the food the first time. Brought a tourist friend who was visiting our sunny island. Ordered the usual sand thought to try the mushroom and truffle cassoulet. Unfortunately that dish tasted off and we told the staff. The staff were absolutely responsive and wanted to provide us a fresh one. However my other diner decided she could not have any more of that and they kindly refunded us the item. We did not expect this level of service and did not at any point expect a refund but they did that anyway.Much appreciated
4
Sin Lee Foods is a unique cafe located in an HDB block near Tiong Bahru. The dishes are a combination of Western (such as chicken and waffles) and Asian (such as chirashi) dishes with a local twist. The salted egg burger and sweet potato fries are pretty good, but the topping is very heavy! Definitely make sure you are a salted egg fan before ordering. The nett prices are very affordable and you can save money through getting a Chope voucher ahead of time. I enjoyed the ambiance and the massive portions, would return!Gave service 3-stars only as it is self-serve (order at the counter). Cash and NETS only
4
I made reservation on a weekday night for two. The space was quite constrained, probably 16 seats indoors at most and some outdoors. However, as it was an open kitchen concept, sitting indoors will result in the stench on your hair and clothes. Would definitely recommend sitting outside if its at night. We ordered the aburi broccoli salad which we had seen quite a good reviews.The taste was unique and it was savoury with the hint of truffle. However, it felt too greasy to me and the two of us found it hard to finish the dish which was quite a pity. It costs $13 as well which was rather expensive in my opinion.
2
The service is shockingly poor, I booked for table of 8 and we were given tables at the walkway exposed to sun, the tables seems like it was a last min set up as the chairs were totally different from the rest and the feeling is that it will break anytime. The food is not too bad but overall the service is very disappointing. Utterly disgusted, what's the use of booking?! definitely not booking Sin Lee for space anymore but will still be using Chope
5
Love how the food is consistently excellent - I've been to Sin Lee Foods a handful of times and each visit is a new discovery of culinary delights. While the restaurant can do with better ventilation, the wait staff are great: attentive and earnest. This truly makes the overall dining experience most enjoyable. Thank you, Sin Lee, for such fantastic marriage of flavours all the time, every time!
4
Prompt and great tasting food, albeit a little less flexible on the menu.
Salted Egg burgers lived up to expectations!
5
Over priced food. Their outdoor atmosphere is 'not good'. Their counter for ordering foods and payment was very dusty, actually a 'very surprised standard' for a restaurant.
1
The staff were screaming and cursing at one of the cooks (it is not a closed kitchen). Shocking and unprofessional. We ate as fast as we could and got out.
3
Good atmosphere but abit pricey for the value of food. Good for small gathering due to space limitation.
3
saw so many pics on social media but it was probably hype. food was so so. chicken waffles was average at best.
3
Had imagined that the dishes would come with more zest for the constant hype and publicity, and given the prices per dish. It wasn't bad, just that it wasn't memorable and nothing in particular stood out.
4
Got to try this cafe once n u will know what I meant. Dishes here are so special that u will be amazed how the chefs could thought of it.
4
Food was great! Tried the waffles chicken and duck bowl. However the foie gras was cold(?) and sweet potato fries with salted egg yolk might be too "gelat" and it hardens when cold
3
Ordered -Sin Lee Fried Chicken & Waffles (Chicken was pretty tasty but waffles were tasteless)Salted Egg Sweet Potato Fries (do not really blend well together, would have been better if fries were just normal fries instead of sweet potato)Sin Lee Breakfast Chirashi Toastie (Salmon was bland. The shoyu & wasabi dressing doesn't complement the dish)We changed our reservation timing from 430pm to 515pm. It was a nice gesture for the staff to call and inform us that their last order was at 530pm and closing at 6pm.However when we reached there, the service staff were disengaged and we did not feel welcomed. Though I had requested via Chope for a seat with good natural lighting, we were initially led to the area with dim lights till I requested to sit at the seat nearest to the entrance
1
I decided to try because it is said to be voted the best cafe. Wrong. Should be worst cafe. Tried it's signature egg yolk sweet potato fries. Given the small portion for an expensive price, three persons cannot finish and left half a bowl. That tells you the taste of its signature dish.The service deserved special mention. 0 star. Horrible. Does not even allow patrons to wait for a seat. INITIALLY, THEY ALLOWED BUT RUDELY SAID "CANNOT STAND HERE AND BLOCK THE CASHIER".HALF A MINUTE LATER: They claimed no table when empty seats are everywhere. It is 2 hours before its closing, yet claim no seat. One even suggested seating us at the neighbouring HDB pavilion where there are many elderly smoking. Since when the restaurant can use HDB pavilion as their own seats? Illegal!This happened despite empy seats - they allow a few empty seats between two couples bar top table with a view. They insisted to send us away in midst of thunderstorm and lightning, and there is no bus stop, or any food outlets nearby. But we gave them a second chance and went back again. Staff is not only bad attitude, but incapable. They keyed in wrong voucher value. They deducted $50 from our bill when it should be $30. We still have a heart to queue and go back to counter a second time, and paid back the $20 to them. All without them saying a word of thank. Maybe we should just leave it and let the service staff make up and literally pay for their own mistake. Visit if you like expensive tasteless food and infuriating inadept service. Thinking of maybe ambience? No. Cafe infrastructure environment is very bad
3
Ordered the chicken waffle - chicken was not bad but waffle was quite disappointing. Also had the salted egg chicken burger which was decent.
5
My favourite dish by far is the salted egg sweet potato fries. And im so looking forward to having salted egg burger to my next visit!
4
We ordered the salted egg burger with the roe add-on. The burger is very good and the portion is just nice. Service is also good.
4
Small cafe, good for small group gathering. Be sure to make reservations before heading down.
Food is tasty and portion is relatively generous. :)
4
Service was prompt.
Menu had a variety of food, many unique flavours and the food really tasted awesome!
It's really worth the price!
3
We had the salted egg chicken burger and yakiniku rice bowls. We were both highly excited but were majorly disappointed. The chicken was unfortunately burnt though the kitchen said it was just caramelised. Sure, but it tasted burnt. I ate it anyway as the salted egg sauce hid the taste. My friend's yakiniku was overcooked sadly, not thinly sliced and soft at all. Quite a disappointment.
3
I was seated inside as I made a reservation with them. However the ambience is not up to my liking;dark,gloomy and so compact! Worse I can smell the stinky toilet So I chose to seat outside. Food choices are limited to rice bowl and one savoury waffle which I thought really need some improvement. I got chicken and waffle and it was just right though a little bit too oily. Waffle wise it's adorable. The winning point at this cafe is the coffee for me. It has sweet note! However overall I think it's just too expensive for a small caf
2
My fiancÃ© and I visited the cafe on Christmas. Initially we made a reservation at 6pm (a week before) but we changed it to 3.30pm on Christmas morning. When we arrived at the cafe, we saw that our reservation was still at 6pm. We had the Duck&Duck, The One & Only and Salts Egg Sweet Potato Fries. The food are overpriced and we didn't manage to finish the food because they were too oily. At 6.15pm, i was surprised to receive a call from the cafe and was asked whether I will be going for dinner. Hmmm.
4
Brocolli salad was the best dish out of everything.The pork chop was Super unique, some sort of a fusion dish. The sour taste of the dish makes the meat more enjoyableCurry and chicken waffles were mediocre at bestCould have been better if they served ice water. You can only order the drink
2
Made an early reservation with the restaurant, however we were given an outdoor seating without being informed. Looked forward to try their salted egg/ mentaiko burger, however, these items are only available on weekdays, hence we left the place feeling disappointed. Food was ok while the aburi salad was a letdown - broccoli was soggy. Ordered coffee and when it was served, the waiter did not take any initiative to ask if I'd like sugar. I requested for some sugar. I was given a jar of sugar but without a teaspoon for me to use for my coffee. Our Japanese curry catfish rice also arrived without any spoon and my group has to request for them. Lastly, this restaurant does not serve any water which is baffling.
4
Menu is interesting. Portion is right for one. Limited choice for beverage. Nice alfresco maybe because it was a windy night.
3
The food were overall ok, still can have improvement. Friendly staff. Go early or reserve a table to avoid peak period.
2
The food is only good for photo-taking. Quality of food, you can better ones else where. Furthermore, the attitude of their servers was like "care less".
3
Don't really think the food was worth the price. Chirashi toastie was underwhelming and the pork chop sauce was too sweet.
4
Even though the airconditioned place is a bit small. The seats outside are actually quite alright!
The food is good and the people are polite.
The broccoli salad is unique and is a must try!
5
food was nice!! Highly recommend the signature food.... the SALTED EGG BURGER! Highly recommended restaurant! You can't miss it!
4
It is the promise of a pretty weird combination which brought me to this place. Waffles and chicken is as hell weird but pretty interesting to the taste buds. Such combination is a little like McGriddles which is both sweet and savoury at the same time. The place is run like a family style cafe and isn't super fantastically dressed up based on the price range I am paying. It is a decent outlet but I would think twice, unless a super craving for waffles and chicken
3
I had high expectations for the food at Sin Lee Foods since the pictures on Instagram are droolworthy, Sin Lee Foods had won best cafe of 2016 and reviews are good. However, I felt that the execution of what would otherwise be a decadent dish in theory, simply did not match up.
3
Maybe it was because i read about all the reviews so my expectations were higher but i was disappointed by the chicken on waffles, or maybe because the flavours didn't agree with me personally. I felt the sauce was very sweet, like melted caramel ice cream. The chicken was ok but the waffles were doughy. The slaw was good. On the whole, it was just average
1
Went during weekday lunch with high anticipation upon seeing Instagram photos. This is more like fast food rather than restaurant. Food ordering has to be done at the counter where only cash or nets is accepted. Oh, and no tap water was served. Despite that, was looking forward to the food and Gosh, these were such disappointment. Ordered chicken and waffles, the waffles were cold and soft. We also tried the foie gras with duck, foie gras was surprisingly cold, smoked duck was too salty for my liking. The sweet potato with egg yolk sauce finally arrived and theSe were unsurprisingly cold too. Did not feel that the egg yolk sauce has complemented or enhanced the sweet potato in anyway. Ordered desert waffle and this was probably slightly better than the rest of the dishes but not fantastic either. There was only 1 server, who had a Super black face, as if the whole world owes him something. The experience left such a bad after taste and I will never revisit this place again and had warned everyone about it
4
Good food, nice ambience. The salted egg sweet potato fries is something new. Only the price is a bit high relative to the food quality.
5
Location was abit hard to find because I somehow got lost, but then the food there was great even though my food came abit late. But on the overall, it was worth the experience.
4
The salted egg sweet potato fries is recommended. The price is reasonable.
And they have different menu on weekdays and weekend. Check out what you want to try before going
4
Restaurant was good as the place was quiet and cosy. Food was good and service was attentive. Will definitely recommend this place to my friends.
3
Saw the ad for the salted egg burger on instagram. It looked heavenly but tasted average. The mentaiko burger on the other hand was really good and didn't feel heavy. Overall an alright experience.
3
Food was still fabulous ofc. Service was courteous.I Choped for 2 indoors and they failed to reserve it. The table outside allocated to me had ants on the edge, so I moved to the next one. I noticed a 6-seater space which they could have segmented into 3 separate tables. Instead, they did not accomadate to the crowd.Hope to see more adaptability on the next trip :) Good luck guy
3
We tried the fried chicken waffles. Chicken was crispy to the C but the waffle batter was a little bland and soggy (could be due to a personal preference for drier crispy waffles). The syrup paired with the meal was slightly tangly but added a nice twist to the regular maple syrup we get
4
The burger is fine though the salted egg paste tasted normal.However, the burger was served cold. I do not know is this suppose to be the case but my other order of the Prawn Paste Chicken with waffle was served super hot. And by the way, the 1 & only signature is worth commending. Thumbs up to the waffle n chicken but thumbs down to the salted egg burger
1
I was looking forward to visit this cafe after seeing the rave reviews. When we arrived, the table next to us ate only half of the 2 dishes ordered & left looking disappointed. I was puzzled but didn't let it bother me. So excited that we ordered 5 dishes to try. Half-way, we found eggshell on the fried chicken. We left that aside and continued eating. To our horror, we found a carcass of an insect in another dish. The supervisor took that insect, claimed that it was fried broccoli floret and said it's edible. When we stared at him in disbelief, he did not offer any apology. Then to our alarm, he said "what do u expect me to do?" Utter rudeness! We had only wanted to give feedback that they check their kitchen and maintain it clean; yet they are ignorant and lack customer service. Definitely not returning to patronise again; food tasted only mediocre
2
We were 6 in total and had a Sunday brunch at Sin Lee.The menu does not have much variety, although all of us ordered different sets to share, the food are too oily (broccoli salad), too much cheese..The service is rather poor - even with empty tables and with NO guest waiting, the waiter constantly came over to take away empty glasses and hinted us to leave. And most terribly, even when we were still sitting, he came and cleaned table with spray and towel? Excuse me?Overall, it's good concept but must improve the food and service quality
3
but outcome is mixed. Waffles and fried chicken... If you love Mentaiko , then you will love the overpowering mentailko pasta.
Other Must tries: The brocoli salad and Banana Horlick Milkshake
5
Went in a group of eight. Reserving a table was fuss free and simple. Food was fantastic. Service was great; staff were very friendly.
2
Serves up interesting food but with not much of quality or taste to rave about. However, thumbs up for the service!
3
The food was nice but at that price, i would be expecting better. Quality of service was not top-notch, and they actually forgot our orders. (1 out of 3)
1
Food was average, shop is quite difficult to locateThe server served my burger to the other table without apologizing. Ended up waiting another 15-20 mins for mine.Anyway the mentaiko burger doesnt taste good, do not order that.Will never return againWorst service eve
5
Visited with a group of 5 friends and we had the salted egg burger, mushroom truffle, duck & duck, yakiniku rice bowl and the mentaiko burger. Duck & duck, and mushroom truffle was awesome, though it'd have been good if rice or some form of base came along with the mushroom truffle (too gao after a while). Everything else was not too bad
4
Nicely named dishes, serving size was filling (unlike many other cafes that can barely fill half your stomach), good ambience. Cafe food in a humble environment and location. One thing they can improve on is the cleanliness, the tables were a tad too sticky for my liking.
3
Came here for the second time. First shock was when I tried to reserve via chope and it said no kids are allowed to dine in this restaurant. Not sure if it's an error as I've definitely brought my child here before. Had to book as all adults in order to get a reservation. As we were a big group with kids, I did specify that we wanted indoor seating preferred but we were offered outdoor dining once we arrive when there was a table big enough for us inside. Understand that they close earlier on Sunday but we felt like we had to rush thru our dinner as the waiting staff were clearing up and giving us the vibes that they wanted us to quickly eat and leave. We enjoyed our waffles with chicken the first time round but this time round, the waffles were abit undercooked as the batter was abit raw in the middle
4
The food here was pretty awesome! We came on a Saturday afternoon to what we thought was an ulu place but found it to be nearly packed with eager customers like us wanting to try the awesome food here. Even my little boy loved the waffles
4
Had the monthly specials: salted egg yolk burger, aburi mentaiko burger and the salmon and tuna chirashi bowl. Weren't as flavorful as how I'd expect it to be but definitely interesting. Would want to go back to try the rest of the other dishes on the menu :
4
Although choices of food were limited, quality of food was fantastic. Probably one of the most delicious brunch I had for a long time. However, customer service and attitude of staff can be improved (probably cuz it's being run by a bunch of younger ones).
4
The food was great and worth the value! Will definitely visit again but maybe on a less crowded day. Went on a Friday night and have to wait for seats even though I made a reservation. Personally feel that the service could be better.
2
Food too pricey and didn't even taste good. They only win at presentation, nothing else besides that.
4
Friendly staff, good ambience, Just that food is a little costly. Was looking forward to try the salted egg york burger, but it wasn't available on the weekends which was disappointing as I don't know that it is being offered only on weekdays
4
I came here half hearted after reading some negative reviews elsewhere. To my delight, my friends and I really enjoyed my meal here. The dishes were innovative, and tasted really good.
3
2 of us ordered a mentaiko Burger and salted egg sweet potato fries to share. portion look slightly small for the fries but it is too flavourful so ideal for group to share. mentaiko Burger was also as tasty, they did cut half for us as per request. We also had drinks, lychee lemonade and peppermint tea. Their hot tea was served in tea bag, which is something that I don't really like but I also forgot to check before ordering.

Tried the mentaiko burger and the Japanese catfish cheese curry - former was a bit of a let down as we'd anticipated pulled pork but were given pork slices which were a bit tough to chew through. Enjoyed the latter though. Prices are pretty steep considering the location.
2
This is my third time visiting. As the first time of visit, I was rejected as told I didn't made any reservation. At my 2nd of visit, I ordered my food and waited for 1.5hours and the food didn't arrive. Hence I left without eating. This Time I made reservation and finally tried the salted egg yolk burger, appearance wise still durable, but the taste wise is not up to standard. The chicken soup dry and not tender. While the other dish we ordered taste so so. Not impressive as it is. That's my personal opinion. Might be different taste bud we have.
4
2nd time having the salted egg burger and still love it. This time round the chicken was slightly darker in color, maybe don't need to fry it that long. But the salted egg sauce was amazing. We got a seat inside but there were some ants on our seats, couldn't change our seats since they said its full house, so they tried to clean by swiping the ants away. But would be great if it was avoided in the first place. Nonetheless, will still come back. Recommended place :
4
went on a Saturday. was expecting to feast on the salted egg burger but didn't know they don't serve it on wkends!! definitely will go back on a wkday for it! we had the Japanese curry catfish claypot rice, the pork chop and the salted egg sweet potato fries the other day and all was good (
5
Food was amazing, service was prompt, food was delivered fast and it tasted sooo good. Tried the yakiniku beef bowl as well as the Chirashi breakfast toastie, both of which were a bomb and worth every dollar. Thank you for the great experience!
5
From food to desserts.. simply love it. Creative and interesting menu and also great plc for friends to eat n chat. Have to go back again to try more.
4
the dishes at sin lee are original and unique, but very rich in flavour at the same time. thus, it would be a place which i eat at only once in a while.
4
Duck & Duck is perfect! Sin Lee Foods never fails to come out with bold recipes that truly delights your taste buds.
5
Food was really flavourful and delicious, would really recommend the broccoli salad and the coconut slushie!!!
5
Very good food at an affordable price! The food served was really yummy. The price is reasonable too. Service was good too.
3
Visited this cafe in the evening and it was a quite a pleasant experience dining in one of the older heartland of Singapore.The vibe was laidback and chill. However, the food was not very memorable, though I wouldn't say it was bad. Worth to go once at least
4
This is a short review of the Aburi Mentaiko Burger served by Sin Lee Foods. Located in a rather obscure location in Tiong Bahru, Sin Lee falls under one of those restaurants with old names and locations with brand new ideas and food. The location is behind Tiong Bahru plaza, up a small hill of HDB flats and right under a HDB block.It took a while to get there but its not difficult to find. The place was nice and quaint and had a good number of people there on a weekday afternoon, filling up about two thirds of the place.The burger is nicely toasted with a hint of butter. The pork is reminiscent of shabu shabu pork in that it came in multiple boiled slices. I counted 6 reasonably long sliced pork slathered with a milky sauce that tastes like a cross between mayo and thousand island sauce...it may be thousand island for all i know but it tastes good together.At $14 with no gst and service charge, the burger is of decent value and tastes decent.I enjoyed the relatively quiet lunch at this place and felt that another visit and another sample dish might be in order
5
I recently has brunch at this restaurant. I found it via a food review app and thought the concept was interesting. The restaurant is in the courtyard if a HDB flat complex and it works very well! There's an inside area and outdoor dining area. Food was unusual but that's what this place is all about!!!Will be back again!
5
They played around with fragrance of the ingredient, sweet, sour, salty and they mixed and matched perfectly. There is a mixed of Asian and Western taste. They also match dessert with main dish like waffle and prawn paste fried chicken and they were married happily. I hope it can be happily ever after
4
Cozy eatery at HDB area. Interesting and yummy food. Don't serve water, all beverage to be purchase which is not friendly.
4
Interesting menu, quaint little cafe. Tried the One and Only Fried Chicken Waffles but it was just so-so, not impressive. Yakiniku rice bowl tasted alright. A little overhyped perhaps but nice cafe to chill in.
5
Went on a Saturday for brunch with family. Great brunch atmosphere and quality food. Must try: Chicken & waffles
3
Service was great ! Food look appetising but taste average. Quite easy to locate. Staff were friendly
4
The afternoon humidity was non-existence within the air-conditioned indoor seats. Food and ingredients were prepared and served sparingly, only issue is no plain water served. Overall good experience.
3
Love the casual laid back vibe, set in a neighbourhood. Portion is pretty huge though the price is a lil pricey for a cafe. The porkchop is delicious. Ordered the salted egg yolk sauce sweet potato fries however they could have given more sauce.
3
Food was interesting and tasty but sitting outside was a drag as it was really warm. Preferable to allow patrons making reservations to indicate whether they prefer indoor or outdoor seating.
4
Place is near the mrt thus it was quite easy to find. Kinda sad that they dont serve warm water tho and we had to purchase a drink. Ordered the har cheong kai chic and waffles which was really great and worth the money cos the portion was damm big LO
3
I went there recently with some of my friends and had the salted egg yolk sweet potato fries, spam fries, yakiniku don, and the mentaiko burger.Food was not bad, but it wasn't stellar. I would say it is more of a hit and miss.The appetizers were good, but way too expensive for a small bowl of appetizers ($12 each). The mains were rather mediocre. For the price we paid ($12 for the burger and $14 for the rice bowl, almost the same price as the appetizers!), I would say it was pretty worth it, but I would not try the more expensive mains if the standard was the same. Overall, pretty average, nothing fantastic, which was a disappointment given that I heard many good recommendations of this place
4
The service was good and the waiting time was pretty alright. It was just that I was expecting to see the Mentaiko Burger in the menu but I didn't. Maybe I should've checked properly before going down that day.. Was a little disappointed but at least there's another Mentaiko dish on the menu that day. I had Mentaiko Okonomiyaki. It was good but the Mentaiko was was too little for that big piece of Okonomiyaki. Other than that, everything else is good :
4
Food was good but a pity aburi mentaiko burger was not available for order as we purposely went down for it. It was only available on weekdays. Will return again!
4
Food and ambience were good. Went down to try the aburi mentai burger but a pity that it was only available on weekdays.
5
the burger was fried just nice, not gelat and the salted egg yolk sauce was'nt diluted. all the ingredients in the salmon and tuna bowl came together perfectly. will be back for more!
3
Prices are a bit on the high side considering the location & deco of restaurant. Requested & confirmed indoor booking but was given outdoor due to bigger group reservation.
4
I've been to Sin Lee before, and they always have consistently good food and service. Large portion sizes, very value for money food. I would definitely go again, recommend for a casual brunch.
5
My friend was forgot to show the chope voucher and paid the bill, then, we talked to the cashier and explain what is happening. The cashier refunded the money. We are really scared that we could not use the voucher anymore.
3
We went here for the Chicken n' Waffles and only tried one other dish on the menu, beef n' grains if I remember correctly, and the Chicken n' Waffles were excellent as was the milkshake, but the other dish was inedible. Would go back for the Chicken n' Waffles, but be hesitant ordering other things off the menu...Or ask other diners what else is good first..
4
a very nostalgic place set amongst the old estate. Food was in fact a fusion of style, from salted egg sweet potato fries to kimchi pork chops. Had the fries, it was very nice with the balance of saltiness of the salted eggs sauce balanced with the sweet potato. The beef and grain bowl is a good combination of italian with Japanese umami gravy. Yumm
4
Reminds me of MyBurgerlab in Petaling Jaya, Malaysia, where new stuffs is always popping up in the menus. Quirky but lip smacking creations indeed! Mentaikou burger is really special! Beef and grains was bursting with flavors that you wouldn't be able to savor any where else. Not to mention the must try salted egg yolk sweet potato fries
3
Saw a post on it and decided to visit it. Ordered their prawn paste chicken waffles and beef & grain. Waffles tastes good. Chicken is drizzled with caramel. But I find the chicken is lacking the prawn paste taste. Beef & grain is interesting. It is with orzo, a type of pasta I never eaten before. Beef portion is good but I would have like it a little more juicy. Cost is pretty high imo but portion is decent. Place is cosy but doesn't feel like can sit and chill for long place.
4
The food was nicely prepared, ingredients used were fresh :) had a great time with me and my friends
5
we had the beef and grains as well as the salted egg burger along with an iced mocha. everything was excellent.
4
They seemed to be a little short-staffed because it took some effort to get them to tend to us. The food was awesome though! You can't go wrong with the salty egg burger.
5
Great service checked. Great food checked. The team worked really well despite the public holiday crowd. Kudos to them for dishing out scrummy food as usual!
5
The environment is very old and rustic which make the dining very enjoyable. Their food was very tasty and nice presentation.
1
The salted egg didnt feel real and just heated powder. It wasnt like those that are in dishes of salted egg calamari which is more liquid. No difference from MacDonalds.
4
I had a breakfast platter of some sort that I can't remember the name of haha. That was not bad and the brocolli dish was quite good too.Only thing is probably the price. I feel that it's a little overpriced for the food fare lol.Service was still quite good despite a few hiccups. Will probably visit 1 more time for their salted egg chicken burger on weekday, since I was quite disappointed to not see it on their menu on a Saturday haha.Thank you. =
3
Tried their signature salted egg burger that they claim to be better than MacDonald..Waiting time for was quite long even though reservation was made in advance. Food takes around 20-25mins after ordering. When the food arrive, visually it looks good but when you take a closer look, the whole chicken thigh was cook close to black. Lettuce given was so little and the taste wise was just average. Not sure whether if I will go again but I would rate a 6.5 out of 10
2
By chance, my friend and i came upon this place. It was a weekday at 1115am, and it was NOT crowded. We ordered the "Korean rubbed chicken thigh with rice" and it turned out to be good. Chicken was tasty and sauce on top of the rice was nice!! So was the waffles and ice cream that we ordered (came with a scoop of coconut ice cream). Waffles was crispy and nice. Service was not fantastic though. By lunch time, around 1245pm, I felt her cold stare of "ok, you should really go now!" even though I was really waiting for my take away which I ordered at the end of our meal.. Well, anyway, ok. we stood outside for the takeaway instead.Btw I ordered the kimchi pork chop for takeaway and did not realise that the meat dish didn't come with rice, just plain two pieces of pork chop with some kimchi. And the taste wasn't too fantastic i thought. Thinking that my family may like the waffles and their tasty rubbed chicken dish, we came back on a public holiday. By the time they open at 11am, there was already a queue of about 4 parties. The crowd started coming in. As soon as we sat down, we were TOLD we need to vacate the table by 1230pm to accommodate to their crowd (you kidding me!??!) Ok, my husband being the patient man he is, said "sure...as long as your food comes on time."We ordered the the following and my review as follows:(we were told that they don't serve the "rice bowl" menu on public holidays)"Beef and grain" - while the beef was tender, the grains were quite flooded with the sauce. "Fried chicken with waffles" - we ordered two portions of this and one piece of the chicken was really way bigger than the other!? Hmmm... (look at my title again!!) Secondly, the waffles was way too soft and not crispy like my first visit. I think i had tasted better waffles-ahd-chicken!!"Sunday at Sin Lee's" - this was basically a full breakfast by its description but we were quite disappointed to not be able to find sausage as a sausage, or bacon as bacon.... Instead the sausage was cut into small cubes and fried together with some mushrooms and ham (or bacon??) - can't even tell what it was!! As sides we had the spam fries and the sweet potato fries - both were ok.Hmmm... food is not cheap and I expect slightly better service, which was not to be the case. And worse if you go on a busy day like a public holiday!
3
Booked via Chope on a Saturday evening to try their Real Salted Egg Burger ($12). Didn't realise it was only available on weekdays (LOL) so we ordered the Beef with Grains ($25) and Iced Mocha instead. Coffee was strong and decent. Main looked great but the broth was much too salty, which ruined the orzo and made eating the otherwise nicely cooked sirloin beef slices a chore. The menu was rather limited.Hipster cafe with both indoor and al fresco seating. Very small place though, so reservations recommended at meal peaks. Service staff were polite and helpful when I asked for a charging point. Thumbs up!Rated 3/5 because food is still the most important factor in any eating establishment. Not sure if I will be back though, especially with the abundance of great eateries in the area
3
We tried the greatly raved about salted egg yolk burger and was a tad disappointed that the sauce wasn't as rich as we thought it would be. The toasted bread was crispy and chicken was juicy though. Place was cozy with nice ambiance.
4
Overall, the food and service were satisfactory. Wish the salted egg yolk sauce was more flavourful like BreadTalk's!
1
we were to order the salted egg burger but the counter said its sold out. 20mins later i see other people eating. so i ask the lady serving. she said the dish is still available.
4
Selection is a bit limited though but that's okay if the standard of food stay consistent.
Closing hour is a bit early at 9pm. Late dinners have to rush through and move to another venue to continue the night
1
We saw a rat in the restaurant. Staff were unable to catch it and eventually it went into the kitchen. The chef was non-chalant about it. They should really look into this issue seriously.
4
Was a little disappointed by the intensity of the salted egg yolk flavour - amy not have been our cup of tea but seeing how a big hit it is, maybe that's just our preference speaking. Other than that, it was a small, cosy set-up with pretty decent fare to boot
4
Food was good but very rich and we couldn't finish what we ordered (sweet potato fries, aburi broccoli and Lobster Truffle Cassoulet). There were a few flies flying around during our dinner as well though we sat indoors, nevertheless, food was generally good though a tad on the pricier side given the location of the establishment
5
Sin Lee Foods is a cafe that I have always wanted to visit since I read good reviews about it. Visited with my friends, we had the salted egg yolk burger, salted egg sweet potato fries, and the waffle with gelato. The portion was great for sharing and we could actually taste the bits of salted egg yolk instead of it just being a sauce. Overall, it's value for money! However due to space constraint, it would be good to make a reservation before heading down
3
i was somehow impressed to find a cafe at such HDB. Honestly, their food was too much of fusion. especially their kimchi pork chop which did not impress us at all. Their broccoli salad was a good one but it will be too much if we order the 2nd plate.I like their sauce for the waffle, the sauce goes well with the waffle rather than the chicken. And the chicken suppose to be Har Jiong Gai taste. But we cant taste the har jiong gai chicken. Kinda of disappointed.The salted egg fried chicken burger i find it normal, i think if the chicken coated with the salted egg it will taste better rather than the sauce pour over the fried chicken. The salted egg sweet potato fries was good. And the korean rubbed chicken thigh rice was good too. Apart we find the dishes average, the waiting time kinda of long and also they have limited seats. I would advise those who wish to go there better make reservation. Lastly, i suggest they install a few more fans outside cos it was a bit warm when we seated outside
1
Was supposed to be there to try the salted egg chicken burger but was told that it is only sold on weekdays, the post on this burger in facebook did not mentioned that its only available on weekdays? Probably I have overlooked but honestly, I spent $63 for 2 pax early in the morning which is way too costly for the breakfast for 2 lattes and 1 daily breakfast $20 and 1 Okonomiyaki $20. The cheapest main dish in the menu is $20, this kind of price I can actually dine in cafes in Orchard which is so much cheaper and taste better. The outdoor sitting tables were not cleaned, sticky
5
The service was remarkable and the salted egg yolk burger was so so good. Me an my friends love it!!
2
Tried the real salted egg burger. Chicken was overcooked; dry, tough and tasteless. What m*donald's wanted to serve but failed to definitely didnt go too well here either.
Need to work on hygiene too!
4
Price was reasonable for the portion and quality. Particularly enjoyed the Lobster and Truffle Cassoulet! Yay!
3
Visited for the popular salted egg burger. Waited 1h20min for the burger. Burger was not bad, chicken was juicy. Not worth the wait though.
5
Visited the place for a second time to try their salted egg yolk chicken burger and it was really good!! They also offer other tasty food in their menu.
5
Really loved the wide variety they have and the cosy atmosphere! Went there with family, great location for brunch!
5
Decided on a simple short dinner and chose this slightly inaccessible joint. The smoothie was great, and ordered 2 rice bowls which was unexpectedly tasty. Arrived around 6.45pm, and weather was pretty cooling. Simple furnishing and enthusiastic servers. Had a good time there.
4
Salted egg yolk chicken burger. Portion was generous, chicken was crispy and the sauce was well done. Spam fries: Portion was slightly smaller than we expected but it was definitely tasty. Unlike what you expect from spam, the dish was surprisingly light. The chilli sauce they served with it goes wellRice bowl: Decent quantity of fish and roe. The dashi stock gave the rice a nice taste too! Overall decent for the price. Like that it was nett price.
4
I always order the fries here, because it's my favorite sweet potato AND salted egg sauce. They definitely put a good deal of salted egg because it tastes so good!! Unfortunately I felt a bit disappointed by the salted egg burger. I thought it could have been more harmonious but the flavor of the chicken clashed strongly with that of the sauce. We liked the beef bowl though!
3
Decidedly average place given the amount of money paid for the meals. Most (if not all) of the mains are upwards of $20. Nevertheless, the cuisine is unique and creative, mixing Western with Asian influences. Go for the fried chicken and waffles - that's the star of the show. If desserts are your thing, the durian waffle should be quite the draw. Service is average (one of my friend's order only came when everyone else was finished eating). And take note that the place does not serve water. The inside of the cafe is air-conditioned but it is a very small area. The outside is equipped with fans but don't expect an alfresco experience and certainly not for hot and humid afternoons. Probably somewhere to go once - worth a visit, but nothing to write home about.
4
Good food! It's really a gem in the neighbourhood! Will definitely go back again!!! will want to try oth dishes too!
5
Four of us went to Sin Lee Foods. The foods are so awesome, especially the durian waffle. We like it a lot and will definitely revisit.
5
The cafe has a nice and cosy atmosphere. The food may seemed pricey but I felt it was really worth the price as the portion was quite big and it was delicious!
4
Interesting fusion food that looks good and tastes good. Salted Egg Sweet Potato fries and the Broccoli salad are must try. Highly Recommended.
4
Food is just great ! Had beef and grains , aburi broccoli salad (my fav) & their 2nd anniversary beef bowl. Everything else was average.
3
Limited choice of food & pricing was on a average high side even though the portion was quite big. food taste wise rather common, nothing special. cafe closed at 9pm thus not a ideal place for group to do catch up.
3
My 2nd visit to Sin Lee Food. Apparently they changed their menu without updating Chope. Standard was alright but wouldn't return back again as there's a slight disappointment in terms of the quality of the food. Not to mention, its pricey. Tried their mentaiko blue crabmeat pancake and their favourites sin lee food prawn paste chicken. Mentaiko pancake doesn't amaze me much, just taste like normal pasa malam mixed pizza with additional toppings on it. While the prawn paste chicken with waffle taste fine
4
Went by for dinner with my family. As usual, we ordered as much as we could eat, in this case almost the entire menu given the small selection, and we shared everything.Food was good, especially enjoyed the Beef & Grains and the Salmon & Tuna Chirashi.Overall, a good neighbourhood restaurant with a small but sufficient selection. Would check it out again if there's a menu change (
3
Dining in this area is very competitive so price and location are 2 key factors to run business here. For the price, it is average compared with those in Tiong Bahru Plaza. The location is very bad...Then how about service? Since the price does include ++, I do not complain here but at least give a cup of water all right
4
Food was good - the salted egg yolk sweet potato fries and aburi broccoli. The grain & beef and mentaiko okonomiyaki were ok - nothing to brag about. A four stars because the price(s) were a little steep. Recommend to try for someone who hasn't been here before but it'll be a while before I decide to come back again.
2
Not worth the walk. Ordered the "famous" fried chicken and waffles. Chicken was soggy, tough cut of meat that with no flavour. Curt sevice. $2 for water.
4
Overall a good experience. Beef and grains is a must order! The salted egg yolk fries were disappointing.
2
Too much salt and cream in all 3 dishes that we tried, including the much raved about Aburi Broccoli Salad; it was anything but light. Saltiness and richness totally tipped the scales, intolerable.
4
Food was ok. Good service. Not that crowded on a ph morning. Will be better if there's more choices on the menu.
5
Sin Lee Foods doesn't disappoint. Beef and grains will always be good for brunch. Look out for the sinful salted egg sweet potato fries too!
5
The beef was cooked perfectly and went really well with the grains and the egg on the side. Creative dishes and generous portions too. The next time I go there, will certainly try their desserts.
4
Good cozy place. Interesting food choices and mixes. The place is a little small.. shld expand to cater for larger crowd.
3
Heard and saw good reviews before and made a reservation.Was not too impressed actually, food choice was limited too. Made a reservation with request for indoor seating but was not given. Told us full house and have to sit outside. Waiter and waitress did not give a smiley face while serving. While I was there already seated, restaurant give me a call at 1.15 to check if I was coming? What? I told them my name when I got there but nobody made a note. Many rooms to improve on
4
Small cafe situated in the heartlands of Singapore but the food was well done. Especially the brocolli salad. Had high hopes for the sweet potato salted egg yolk fries but I felt that the flavors did not mesh well together. They were all competing with each other. Perhaps replace sweet potato with normal fries?
3
Ordered the beef and gratin (?) for brunch, the beef was too tough but the rice was great. However I found it too expensive and they could downsize the portion a tiny bit. Didn't find what was so special about this place. Decor was great, loved it. The sweet potato fries were great, but will not come back again. Not for everyone, but i'm sure there are better options off the menu
3
Concepts looked great on paper but tasted average. A tad overpriced for what you get but this is Singapore after all
3
Food was good, we especially like the Lobster & Truffle. The waffles served were very fluffy & light. But the price was a little too ex - average about $22 for the main meal. It is quite a small place so best to make reservations.
3
Had the signature chicken and waffles which was sadly disappointing. Could have done with a stronger flavour profile.
4
Food was amazing, service was good. Food could have been served more promptly though. The outdoor seating had a nice ambience as well.
3
Food was average and the price of the food is expensive. Service was good and would not visit that often due to the price
3
Love the aburi broccoli!
The fried chicken and waffle is always pretty yummy too.
Service staff are a little surly - "The menu is not meant as a placemat!"
3
This cute little cafe is right in a HDB in Singapore. Good brunch food with local takes on some traditional western dishes. Had chicken and waffles, yummy broccoli salad with broccoli that was charred after steaming and steak and risotto. All good. Place was busy with a wait by the time we left. Worth a visit if in the neighborhood
4
Very satisfied with the food quality and creativity. From Appetizer, to main course and to dessert. The must try, must be the Sweet potato salad, Lobster and Truffle, Chicken and waffle and the durian dessert.One 'complain' is, the food prices are a tad expensive though. Be prepared to be set back by a few hundred dollars with a party of 7
4
Neighbourhood cafe that is worth paying a visit. The fried chicken and waffled was a unique dish. Imagine the feeling of eating har cheong gai on top of crispy yet moist waffles - yup. No one would have imagined. The beef and grain was the winner. Super suited for the chinese taste with the sedap sauce! Yummy sauce with unique rice looking grains that gave a good texture... the owner was also pretty helpful in recommending places that we could visit for deserts.
1
We reserved a table for 3, arrived earlier but was rejected to be seated inside the shop. Waiter mentioned tgat if there's available seats we will be shifted in.. But it didn't happen. Lousy food. The fried chicken waffle tasted bad. Chicken was a tad bit gamey,not well marinated and waffle has nothing to shout about. Salted egg sweet potato fries was a complete let down. Suggest for thinner cuts to retain the crisp and do work on the salted egg sauce. Only the aburi brocolli managed to savior our tastebuds.
3
Place was tight but cosy, and broccoli dish was really good! Quite a bit of walk from tiong bahru mrt.
4
Overall food was great but price is a little expensive. The salted egg yolk sweet potato fries is a must try if you are there.
1
We were intrigued by the newsletter and head out to Sin Lee Foods. The slogan on "homemade food" kinda disappointed us. The food was nothing but readymade food from supermarket - smoked salmon. Drinks were just colourings.
4
That unforgettable taste of a bowl of torched broccoli paired with papadum cracker sprinkled with red sugar! Really good.
3
Most of the food are sweet and with sugar, best place for sweet tooth person. take the out side seat to avoid oil smoke stain all over you :-)
3
Food menu unique but food is too salty for me. Felt overpriced as well. But other than that, experience was all right.
4
I chanced upon the cafe in the advert from chope reservation. No regrets having dinner there though the salted egg sweet potato fries was no available. Presentation of food is nice. Taste of the food is great as well. Price ranges from $15-$20. Great place for couples and friends. They have outdoor seatings too.
3
Kudos to the kitchen for whipping up an interesting menu. However, professionalism of the service staff is highly questionable. Chewing on food while serving/talking to guests and not knowing what item they are serving were not the best experience we've had at a comparable cafe. Will still come back for the food though
5
Recommended and would definitely go back again. Made a reservation for my friend's birthday, arrived earlier and they sat us on a table first while waiting for the other table to clear. When I asked if I could put my cake in their fridge, they not only agreed but also went a step further to ask if I need candles, and whether it was a surprise for my friend. Had a wonderful dinner and the food is awesome!!!
2
This is my third visit to this establishment, and I was absolutely shocked to find out that the cafe stopped offering the option of tap water, instead customers have to pay $4 for "still water" from Italy. It's ridiculous to think that my glass of water had to fly 13 hours to get here, when I can enjoy decent tap water in Singapore. Ecologically it's so damaging. What a shame for this once cool innovative neighbourhood cafe. Most cafes that I've visited offer complimentary tap water, I don't see why Sin Lee Foods couldn't do the same? If profit is the concern, I think at the very least charge for tap water but don't make it as a non option.Sad to say, although I used to enjoy their food very much, unless they resume offering tap water I won't be returning anytime soon..
3
Pros: food was tasty and well presented
Cons: menunlacked variety, food did not come at the same time or almost at the same time. Place was not easy to find if you do not drive.
4
Ordered Aburi Broccoli salad, sweet potato fries with salted egg yolk sauce and skillet roasted pork chop. The aburi salad and sweet potato fries were superb! Prok chop was abit too tough though.
4
1) Nostalgic feel.
2) Love the crispy chicken with waffles!
3) Wish the milkshake has a thicker taste.
4) The table has a sticky feel.
5) Do reserve in advance via chope.
4
Interesting local variations of brunch food, quirky but it works! Nostalgic setting and good service too.

Presentation of food served rather messy. Expensive considering menu and locality. Not to mention try comparing your prices with other similar medium range outlets in shopping Centre. And those in food court.

We ordered quite a few items on the menu as we went in quite a big group. I can say that there wasn't even one item that we all thought were good and actually worth the price we were paying.The Aburi Broccoli salad was just a bowl of burnt broccoli to me. The fried chicken on our Chicken Waffles tasted really odd, which we later suspected that it was either not fresh or already spoilt. The sweet potato fries in the Sweet Potato Fries and Salted Egg Yolk was kind of soft and soggy; definitely not what you expect fries to feel like in your mouth. The Softshell Crab Mantao was pretty average, so was the Pork Chop and the Chinese Wedding Squid. Overall, it's really just wayyyy too expensive for the standard of food we were getting. Sure, the menu is unique and offers some interesting combinations and fusion of different cuisines, but what use is that if the food doesn't taste good, amirite? Honestly, I wasn't impressed with anything this place had to offer

Ordered salted egg yolk sweet potato fries, chicken on waffle, and beef and grains. Sweet potato fries was too soft and the salted egg yolk sauce was not enough. Chicken and coleslaw were good but not for the waffle - too soft. Beef and grain was only average. I think it's because of the sauce, the beef was tender and juicy. The sauce kind of ruins everything. Overall, the food was not up to my expectations and I found it too expensive for the quality of food served and the location.

Sin Lee is situated in a humble quaint old neighbourhood estate in Jln Bukit Ho Swee. The interiors of the restaurant is raw. The food, when we took the first bite, it was just an explosion of flavors. You kinda understand the thought process of the chef into making these awesome food. The crunch, the sweetness, the saltiness. The broccoli salad is just beyond words
3
decent food but definitely pricey. 3 sides 3 mains 1 sweet and 2 coffees for almost 140$. to think that they don't provide iced water to their guests is quite crazy. in this day and age (charge me if you must like 30cents or smth but they only do bottled water)the layout of the place is small with minimal indoor and outdoor seating. the menus needs some serious up keeping with food stains and torn bits all over.

Came to Sin Lee for dinner. It's a shop in Bukit Ho Swee area under a HDB flat. From outside it does not look too great, tacky deco, and the interior is barely decorated with red bricked wall and stone benches. Guess the cafe is trying to give the diners an old world feel. The aburi broccoli is interesting. Crunchy from the torching. Spam fries is spam fries, can't really go wrong with it.. The prawn paste fried chicken with waffle and coleslaw is not bad, think the bland waffle balance the tasty chicken. The salmon hash is average, with small cures of seared potatoes. The breakfast tortilla is full of surprises. Tortilla, 2 types of sausages, corn and sliced sausages, scrambled eggs, bacon. Taste ok. Did not order any dessert as we are too overwhelmed by oiliness after the main courses. The downside is that they don't serve water. Must buy Aqua panna.
3
New experience. Unique menu. Aburi Brocolli was something new. However, it tasted a little too burnt. Food tends to be on the oily side.
4
The staffs are friendly and atmosphere is nice...
Fried chicken with waffle is awesome... we love it 😍
3
Interior got a very raw feel ... Interesting ... Food wise mostly are too salty for us . Unique dishes though. Can be better
3
The food flavours are unique but poor valued considering the ordinary ingredients, non-generous portions and back-to-basics set up. Drinks are really expensive and they don't serve water.
4
Nice place to hang around and their foods also v good specially the waffle fried chicken and the pork chop serve wth nyonya acar are good too
5
Food was unique & tasted awesome! Love the beef & grain & broccoli dish! Didnt know broccoli could be so delicious. Staff were very friendly too !
2
Limited menu. Broccoli salad was good. Salted egg yolk fries was soggy. Ordered the breakfast tortilla but was soaked with oil. Got a refund. Good service recovery by offer 10% off next visit. But doubt will return again.

Sin Lee foods has a great location in a cosy Bukit Ho Swee block behind painfully trendy Tiong Bahru. We sat outside to accommodate my dog and they were very kind to offer him water. The space is a bit small and when it rains it can be difficult to go up to the counter (to place your order and prepay) without getting wet. Three of us had the salted egg yolk sweet potato fries, beef and grains, chicken and waffles and smoked salmon hash. The descriptions on the menu make everything sound delicious although not everything delivered. The fries were interesting but not very crispy (hard to do with sweet potato I know). The fried chicken and waffles were good although the serving of maple syrup was a bit stingy. Cannot compare to my gold standard (Roscoes in LA) but then no place does, really. The hash in the smoked salmon hash was good but the runny egg with it was a bit cold. The beef and grains ( a nice steak with orzo pasta in a vaguely Japanese flavoured sauce with ginger and sesame seeds and a sunny side up fried egg) was not quite what I expected. Each element was tasty but I am not sure they came together perfectly. Also the sauce was a bit wetter than I expected. Finally, my bugbear for any place aspiring to be a serious contender - the mains did not arrive at the same time.There is some inspiration in the Flavours being attempted but more practice and fine tuning is required to improve execution.P/s flavoured lemonades were good

Food was average but seemed overpriced for the standard of taste. The signature fried chicken with waffles was pretty good but u will have to eat it while it's hot or risk the oily fried chicken turning the waffles soggy. The broccoli salad was a saving grace although at $12($13??) it was rather pricey. Not likely to go back.

It's hard to believe that so much has changed at this cafe in the past 9 months. The exterior and interior of the cafe looks the same. The menu pretty much looks the same but nothing tastes the same. Ordered the salted egg sweet potato fries again as the last time I had it, it was memorable and good. This time the salted egg sauce was too diluted and I could barely taste the salted egg. The sweet potato fries were also quite soggy.The spam fries were not much better, hard and not up to a $10 standard for sure. The spicy aioli was it's only saving grace. The portion was small.The beef and grains at $25, is still good. The beef is juicy and tender and the wild rice was tasty. Their drinks have gone down the drain. Their once really awesome pie crust drink has now turned into a banana horlicks smoothie? It was so diluted and my table ordered 2 of this and 4 of this to go, all of them tasted to same. And they're $9 each! I tried a coconut slushie and it was icy and though it had a strong coconutty taste, with some red jelly nata de coco. It was NOT WORTH $9 at all! Give me 3 cups of gong cha with jelly over this ANY DAY.It was an embarrassment to bring my ground of friends here last night. At Tiong Bahru, there's alot of other better options. I'm wondering what are the owners thinking?There's a 10% discount going on for vdub owners

mains were average. the brocolli salad was amazing. the location is quite inaccesible and the food is not worth the price.
3
food is good. However, the taste is a bit expensive (does not comenaurate with the expected taste)..
5
Enjoyed my first trip. Great food with nice environment plus awesome service. Looking forward for next trip back.

Hipster joints like this are mushrooming around singapore, but not all have substance. For the location, service and quality of food this venue is overpriced.
5
The food was good, especially the broccoli. But food was pricey. Cafe mocha was so so. But I will be back for the broccoli.
4
Food is excellent. However, the ice latte seems a bit bland in taste. It is great if the operating hours is stretched beyond 9pm on weekdays and beyond 6pm on weekends.
2
the Sin Lee's signature Fried chicken with waffle was meh. and the chicken was so oily it made the waffle become soggy. Gross.The salted egg sweet potato sounded delicious but in fact was a poor combination.Not to mention the salted egg sauce was too bland. The restaurant wasn't very busy but still took a long time to serve the food. on top of which, there were no ice water provided. You could choose to buy expensive bottled water though. not to mention the ulu location despite the fact we drove. not worth going again.
3
The location is kinda hard to reach, hidden in the HDB block. The food is about right, but not fantastic. We made a reservation for 4 at 12.30pm but the staff told us we can only stay for one hour as they have another big group coming in. Don't think we are coming back to this place

I am not a fan of the singapore cafe scene. Except for a handful of cafes, I think most cafes in singapore serve boring food (eggs benedict, pancakes, waffles) at an atrocious price. Here, you can expect food thats not of the ordinary, and yet still tastes phenomenal! I tried the sweet potato salted egg yolk fries and the grilled broccoli and both were fantastic. The sweet potato salted egg yolk fries were so flavourful and I preferred them to Five&Dime's version! For my main, I had the beef which BLEW. MY. MIND. Words cant describe it, you have to go try it yourself. Service was efficient and polite. The only bad thing about this place is that it's abit difficult to find

The food and drinks were great. Except me and my friend prefer real ingredients used to prepare the drinks instead of using syrup. The ambiance was good, except the seats had several ants crawling around making us uncomfortable.Service was good and fast. Perhaps too fast as the waitresses kept looking at the patrons using their meals, may have cause us to feel stressed to finish our meals fast. We're not done with a dish and the waitresses kept coming over to ask to clear. I don't think this is very nice to do, hence the experience was slightly tainted by this. Besides, there was no queue. I don't understand why is there a need to make the patrons feel rushed. Nonetheless, the food and ambiance was good
5
A cozy relaxing cafe. Good food here but a bit pricey. Staff are really friendly.
It's a gem cafe :)
4
Really nice atmosphere for talking and chilling out. The Aburi Broccoli Salad ($12) was super yummy!
3
Food was pricy for its standard in my opinion. Wanted to try honey toast but they ran out of it at 2pm on a weekend. Was glad I didn't have to wait for a seat!
3
Not many items in the menu. Food was delicious. The tea we ordered should be better served in a pot rather than a cup & tea bag. Location was not easy to find.

I go to Sin Lee Foods once every 2 months or so and I remember why I love this place so much, every time I'm there. Food here is priced higher than other cafes, but the food is on a entirely different level. For my latest visit, I made a reservation for 1 adult and 2 kids at 11.30am, but I had forgotten to cook for my younger daughter, so we were running late and they kindly offered to change my reservation to 12.30pm. It was pouring when we reached the carpark and a phone call with no questions asked was all it took for one of their staff to come wait with my kids, while I parked. They offered to do the same, when we were leaving, despite the busy day at the cafe. Service aside, this cafe offers what others don't. Real food with rich flavours. I try to go with a big group of friends, so I can order different dishes, but I never fail to order my favourite; Beef and Grains. Priced at SGD$25, this bowl of orzo rice absorbs all the richness of the savoury stock, while a slab of striploin cosy up with a sunny-side-up. If I had a Japanese-American culinary-school graduate as my grandmother, this is what I'd imagine to come out from her kitchen. My 3-year-old had the Smoked Salmon Hash and almost finished everything by herself! The perfect little cubes of crunchy potatoes meet smoked salmon and crispy bacon bits for plenty of flavours on a plate. I can't wait to go back again

It's was over rated for all other dishes. We have the breakfast tortilla for $19, the pork bratwurst/spicy chorizo(was like only half-cut, definitely not worth) and bacon was over cooked, it's was hard as metal, the only edible was the eggs for the whole dish. The chicken with waffles was good, but was very dry and pale looking at the first sight. The sauce with the chicken was nice to go with. Lastly the salted egg sweet potato fries was the only awesome thing in this cafe, it's a must try combo of the salted egg and the sweetness of the potato goes well (priced at $12). Will only come back to have take away fries only
1
We had 3 mains, the last main came about 20minutes after the first. The final plate that arrived was the breakfast tortilla, and thats a half sausage and half a chipotle, 2 tortilla skins, some leaves and 2 half boil eggs. Eggs and sausage were cold and egg yolk has burst, c'mon 20 bucks and a half hour wait. Its a too simple breakfast to ruin
4
The food here was great! Very unique and reasonably priced. Absolutely love the aburi broccoli salad and salted egg sweet potato fries! The coffee, magic was very smooth. Although they were really busy on a Sunday morning, they still accommodated when I had to make changes to my booking time.

I'm not a food connoisseur so it takes alot for me to complain that the food is bad at an establishment. The good: Friendly and attentive wait staff. That's allThe bad: The ridiculous prices of the food, which wasnt justifiable by its quality. The signature dish was apparently the fried chicken with waffle? Well, I paid almost $22 to eat a piece of oily chicken (which tasted more like prawn paste chicken) on a piece of hard, chewy waffle. Even Prima Deli does better waffles than Sin Lee. And there was a fish dish which cost something like $25 for this tiny puny piece of fish that was not filling at all. I had the fish and let's just say I was immediately hungry right after my meal, no joke. The only food that was half decent was the fries thing, but even that was exorbitantly expensive and you can just walk to Tiong Bahru Plaza to buy much cheaper fries. Even Tiong Bahru Club, another hippie place nearby, serves much better spicy fries at a much lower price.Honestly even the decor wasnt amazing as such rustic, minimalist renovations are now dime a dozen. Once the novelty wears off, this place will not survive unless its owners rethink its pricing logic

Having passed by the place twice and seeing it full, it aroused my curiosity to give it a try. Saturday morning at 10 am, we were probably their first customers, it could be due to the drizzle.We ordered the truffle fries which we liked. It's more like potato chips rather than french fries. One just leads to another. The tortilla was so so. The tortilla itself was cold. Scrambled eggs was plain. The sausage and bacon: nothing to shout about. The broccoli dish was interesting but some of them seemed a bit burned. The papadom bits turned soggy quickly. I didn't appreciate the type of ice cubes they used in the chilled drinks. At $7.50 for an iced mocha, I expected more refined ice cubes rather than the coffee shops type. A thick slice of buttered toast, which wasn't in the menu, would set you back by $5! A little steep, isn't it?
5
The food was creatively brilliant (sweet potato fries made even more epic with the addition of salted egg sauce) and the service was impeccable. The quaintness of its HDB-licious heartlandy surroundings certainly upped its hipster cred as well.

I would never eat here again based solely on the terrible customer service. With prices this high, the least the staff could do is wait on you. But no, you place your order at the counter. At that time, they'll inform you that they're cash only, save for Nets cards (which doesn't help travelersâ€”only locals). Then they'll direct you to an ATM that's about 20 minutes away, but they won't tell you it's 20 minutes away. So you go walking to find the ATM while your girlfriend waits at the table. And waits. And waits. Meanwhile, the bonehead at the register has already put the order through and dishes are flying out of the kitchen as fast as the chefs can make them. This place is small. It's clear you are not at the table to eat the food that is coming out, because you've gone on a wild goose chase to find an ATM machine that doesn't exist where they say it exists. Who does that? Hold the order till the person who ordered it has come back and paid! But nope, 40 minutes later, you finally found an ATM (not the one they sent you to) and paid, but all of the dishes have been sitting on the table getting cold and gelatinous in your absence. When you send the fries back to be re-heated, because obviously they're disgusting at this point, the chef gives you attitude, as does the entire waitstaff. They then proceed to stand in the kitchen making fun of you, the travelers who have gone out of your way to eat at this restaurant because you'd heard such good things, pointing and laughing as if they're still in high school. I've been covering restaurants for major magazines and websites for over a decade and have never witnessed behavior this poor or unprofessional. Grow up, guys, or you deserve to go out of business

Love the ambience of the cafe. But food wise, nothing wow. The salted egg sweet potato fries was a good try but remember to eat it hot. The beef and grain tastes too salty when you eat more and more, beef slice was good though. Fried chicken with Waffles was a totally bad choice, waffle is tasteless and the chicken have a bad oily taste. Nothing lure me of patronizing anytime soon again

Took the wife and baby to Sin Lee late on Sat afternoon and was shocked to see it packed with hipsters - apparently 5pm is the new lunch hour!! Anyway, imagine your favorite food... Now deep fry it, and slather egg on it, blowtorch it again. That seems to be the philosophy here, and for the most part it works well! Sweet potato fries in salted egg sauce was the clear winner, couldn't get enough. But the broccoli aburi was super interesting too. The deep fried soft shell crab in fried bun with fried poppadum and soft eggs might have been too much of a good thing though. Definitely worth a visit, but maybe go for a workout first!!
3
Serving little, their salted egg fries has not enough sauce and when asked for more, they took our fries back to the kitchen and came back with the same thing, telling us we need to top up 7 bucks for sauce. :(But a good thing is they gave us a candle and served the waffles with the candle lighted up

About a 10 minute walk from Tiong Bahru, might be difficult to spot if unfamiliar with the areaThe place was refurbished to give a quirky, retro feelFood was average and a little pricey for the quality of itAburi broccoli salad - interesting dish where the broccoli was torched to give a charred flavour that went well with the dressing that gave a sweet, tangy burst of flavour with every mouthfulSweet potato fries with salted egg yolk dressing - must be eaten warm. although sweet potato fries and salted egg yolk are things I love, somehow the flavours of these 2 items didn't meld as well as I thought they wouldWaffle and fried chicken - their signature dish which I felt was really "meh" and pricey. Just a piece of fried chicken on top of a waffle which was a little too chewy in texture. Skip this dish when you are thereCroissand bread and butter pudding with vanilla ice cream - comforting dessert albeit a little too cloyingOverall, food was average in taste with a pricey tag. Being a mid week night when I visited, the place wasn't crowded and was great for catching up with friends. But with the number of cafes springing up in Singapore, I doubt I will return for the food alon
3
Sweet potatoe fry cost S$12 for a bowl of not more than 18pcs. S$12 for a broccoli salad about 15 floweret. No ambience. you need to order from cashier and pay before the food is being served so i classify it as no service. Taste for both dishes are not bad not fantastic and the wow factor comes from the pricing
2
Salted egg yolk sweet potato fries were soggy and lacked the savoriness of the salted egg yolk. The waffle was cardboardy and lacked a hearty substance. The potatoes in the salmon hash were burnt and very oily. The "Big Breakfast"-type serving was mostly tortilla and nothing else.

It was quite difficult trying to find Sin Lee Foods, do note you can technically take a 15 minute strong from Tiong Bahru MRT. There are parallel parking HDB lots along side the shop, it's a one way street. It's free parking on sundays! And park right opposite block 6C Boon Tiong Road if you want to be right there at the shop!It's not a huge shop, located amongst mama shops and a chai peng stall, which we found out sells 2veg1meat for only $2.50, is this Sin Lee Foods.The interior has seating capacity of maybe 15-20. The air conditioning is really strong and I felt kinda cold. We were there at 7pm and we were the only customers. At 8pm on a weekday night, was when customers started strolling in.Taking a look at the menu, they don't offer the typical cafe food. Thank God! ANTI-HIPSTER ALERT! But chicken and waffles is their specicality!1. Salted Egg Sweet Potato Fries $12Ok so, everything in Singapore tastes well with salted egg now! Even sweet potato fries! This was the first dish to arrive on the table, and it was the first to be devoured! The sweet potato fries were moist and mushy on the inside and the salted egg sauce added a little oomph to the salty-ness of the sweet potato. A match made in heaven. I strongly advise you to try this dish!2. Chicken and Waffles $21.90And after 20 minutes of waiting, here it was!! It definitely took a while for them to make it even though we were the only customers. The chicken was huge and the waffle was very brown, signifying it had been cooked for quite a while in their iron waffle!Chicken waffles - The honour of blessing the chicken with maple syrup! MAPLE SYRUP, OH! How I could sing of your joy forever! It made everything on this plate a tad sweet! It wasn't as sweet as the pie crust milkshake, so fret not! It will not ruin the taste of your $9 milkshake.The chicken was more like a prawn paste chicken, which smelt kinda strange? I don't know, maybe my senses weren't working too well. The slaw was a nice mix with the waffle and chicken. The waffle itself was so crisp, it was very easy to separate it into 4 quadrants. The waffle was a little bit sweet too, rather than salty.But for $21.90 this is on the pricey side!3. Pie Crust Milkshake $9I would describe this as an oreo milkshake, whereby you ran out of oreos and substituted the oreos for digestive graham crackers! This is literally what it was! It was very filling, since it was literally a fiber-full drink of digestives. Even at the top of the drink, you can see tons of digestives crumbs!All in all, my heart has been won over by their salted egg sweet potato fries and I will be back here to try their infamous aburi broccoli

Food served were wonderful, atmosphere in restaurant was great and the taste of the Aburi Broccoli Salad made my partner and I to sit up as the taste is very unique and different from other Broccoli dishes that we had before. Staff were attentive to details hence made the entire eating experience even more enjoyable.
