Private service, just lazy? Waved with hands, shouted "Closed" at me and that was it. Thank you for experience!

I think he has been making Noodles in this location for the last twenty years, so they should be good! Attended with a large group 20+ and food all served together and was very good.

I live in Singapore since 2015 and for me it is one of the best noodle in Singapore. You must try Pork chop Noodles. Try to eat it slowly to feel the texture and flavour! It is perfect!!!

Stumbled across the restaurant just wandering around. TripAdvisor Recommendation plaque on wall caught our eye. Fresh noodles were being made and cooked and served to patrons. A couple walked in and obviously knew the owner and said "I'll have my usual". We sat down and were quickly waited on and served. Dumplings were fresh made - we watched. Noodles in main course were fresh and delicious. Portions are not large but the quality is super
2
The tastes of the minced meat noodles and the dumplings were good, but the portions were rather small. We ordered a bowl of noodles, a plate of vegetables, tofu and dumplings for three people and walked out not quite full. Also, after we ordered, the waitress brought a little dish of pickled vegetables and, in response to our asking if there was a charge for it, she said it was “compulsory.” On our bill, we were charged for the “compulsory” dish
5
Five of us ate here at lunch time on a Thursday. We had a table wuickly and service was prompt. It wss a delight to see the noodles actually being made. The flavours were superb and this place is hugely recommended to tourists and locals. A large variety of dishes but noodles a specialty. Great value for money and a cheap spot to eat.

The reviews here are unbalanced. The noodles were good. I’m not an expert but they tasted similar to others at nearby hawkers like Maxwell but at 2x the price.3 of us ate for about $40.They will charge you for the wet napkin and pickles without telling you.They also won’t give you a real receipt but one on Chinese so you can’t see the extra fees.Good food but not worth it
5
Amazing fresh made noodles, made right in front of you prepared fresh just for you, very nice people good service and the taste of every dish i ever tried there was amazing ine of my favorite places in Singapore and also not expensive, every time im in Singapore i have to go there!

We went because of the positive reviews, and assumed we would be getting a fairly cheap, delicious, and filling meal. We've been living in Singapore for six months, so we have a good sense of what to expect from a noodle place. This was crazy, though. The food was not as good as what you can get in a standard hawker stall. The portions were TINY (what appeared on the menu to be a main dish of honey pork chop for $12.80 was literally five bite-size pieces of pork--that's it!). The noodles were tasty enough, but certainly didn't justify charging twice the price of what you'd get in a hawker stall. The pan-fried dumplings were oily. They won't serve tap water, so you have to pay $2.50 for a bottle of water. There's a charge of $3.00 for a tiny pickled vegetable bowl they place in front of you and two napkins. And then a 10% service charge. A very basic--and nothing special--meal consisting of a tiny (cup-size) soup, a bowl of noodles with minced pork, five-bites of pork, and 8 pan-fried dumplings ended up costing over $42. It would have been about $10-15 in a hawker center. I can understand charging more if it were an upscale place, but this isn't that. We won't be back

Came to noodle man since it had very positive reviews on Tripadvisor. It is NOT low budget (small water 2.50) also the portions are very small.After we ordered (two mains) the lady brought us an appetizer and napkins which we didn't order. I later told her that we didn't order it (we also hadn't touched any of it) so she said it's for every table. I then asked her whether it was free and she said oh no it'll be charged. I think this is very rude! She didn't say a single word when we ordered food and also she didn't take it back but said it was compulsory for every table. Tourist trap!! There are so many better places.Also there were dirty dishes on the table next to us the whole time! All in all we paid 23 dollars for tofu and noodles..ridiculous 
5
We couldn't decide on what to eat and we stumbled upon Noodle man. Excellent price, Excellent noodles and dumplings, highly recommended. The decor wont blow you away but the food is worth it.
5
If you want simple, fresh and the best food go here. From the outside it does not look flash, but the Noodle man makes them in from if you and then cooks them, the dumplings are even better. Will be visiting again
5
Food was very good. We had noodels and dumblings. Especially the hand made noodels (~7SGD) were very delicious. Location was clean but not very special.
5
Handmade noodles! Great experience. Its not cheap but it worth it! The lady was very kind and she suggested us what was the best plate.. a lot of pics Made the experience great
5
TripAdvisor didn't lie this time.Hidden within Chinatown, you might have to wait for a place. However the waiting is worth it. Replay nice waitress explaining all and giving tips what to try.Price is ridiculous low for what you get (and for Singapur). Also includes the noodles man noodles making show ;) We would come definitely again (even though a air condition is missing)

I've been to Noodle Man a couple of times now. They offer simple, fresh food and friendly service. They have at least one vegan/veggie dish. To be honest, there's not a lot of good quality, authentic fare in the Pagoda street area as it's quite touristy. Noodle Many is a safe bet for something good if you happen to be down there. The only con is that it's a bit pricey. I suppose it has to be to compete with the tourist trap restaurants that surround it. Just a word of warning, like many Chinese restaurants in Singapore, they give you a towelette and some pickled vegetables to snack on and then charge you for them at the end. I tried passing on these once as I was on a very quick lunch break and trying to keep costs to a minimum; staff didn't look pleased with me
5
This Guy has been here forever and you could easily walk straight past as you are distracted by the tables and food markets on the street - my advise - dont walk past. An unassuming little store that specialises in great home made noodles and dumplings made in front of you. Noodle man is accomodating for photos and his fried rice is also worth getting. Sounds basic - but good food often is, when it is done as good as this
5
The dumplings made by the Noodle Man are the best I have eaten anywhere in the world. The Noodle Man is a master at his trade, using an original recipe passed down by master noodle makers that trained him....these are worth travelling to Singapore for! Well priced, fantastic cheery service, and to top it off a demonstration of twirling the noodles adds to an exceptional experience.
5
We have previously eaten at this Chinatown delight, and when again in Singapore we took the opportunity to revisit the Noodle Man. The restaurant is not fancy, but the food is delicious and very tasty. The helpful staff provided recommendations and suggestions. We will certainly make our way back to the Noodle Man when we are next in Singapore. Recommende

It is not standard protocol in Singapore to be charged for items that have not been ordered (napkins and appetiser) nor is $2.50 for a small bottle of water standard at a hawker center type of place. This could be overlooked if the food was exceptional but it's average and too oily. The clientele seems to be primarily families with young children who are entertained by "the man" stretching noodles. There are so many great restaurants in Singapore. Don't waste your time and money here.
4
Food is very nice and staff is good.
The only problem is they don't give you tap water (in Singapore...).
Kitchen close at 9,45 pm (restaurant at 10,30)
5
Best noodles, steamed dumplings... great simple food packed with flavor
A must if wandering around China Town
5
Authentic, friendly, atmospheric, fair price. The noodles are amazing - stand out for us was the garlic prawns. They'll make plain noodles or stir fried rice for kids on request.
4
Noodles are fresh, you see them being made throughout the night. Tasty food, well priced and full of atmosphere.
It does get busy and you may have to wait 15mins but worth it.
5
Family run, friendly service. My go to destination in China Town, with the best hand made dumplings I've had outside of Shanghai! Try the steamed pork dumplings, 5 out of 5.
4
Small hole-in-the-wall spot but wonderful experience. We were advised to visit by locals and very happy we did. The noodles are hand made on the spot for your order so they are FRESH. Four of us made different selections and then we shared. Everything was very good
5
We had two fantastic dinners here after finding it hard to choose a meal the first time, making a second trip necessary! The service was great both times - we had chicken noodles, dim sum and chicken with plum sauce the first time. Very reasonably priced (for Singapore). The second time we had dim sum noodles and chicken noodles. Absolutely would recommend for a dinner in Chinatown
5
So many places to choose from in this area and it is tempting to eat in one of the outside areas. In this small basic resteraunt you can watch the chef make his own fresh noodles while choosing what you want to eat. The dim sum and spicy prawns were recommended to us and they didn't disappoint. Would definitely return and recommend. Lovely staff
5
I have lived here for 3 years now and I have yet to find a place I enjoy going to more. The service, food quality and atmosphere are great! He makes the noodles right in front of you so you know they're fresh. The steamed vegetable/pork dumplings are delicious. Would highly recommend stopping by here if you're in Chinatown.
5
On recommendation of our friends, we find at Noodle Man and were not disappointed. Lots of choice and the waitress as very patient whilst we made our selection. All dishes were freshly prepared and very tasty however portion size is joy huge so if you are hungry, order more. Wish we had..delightful
4
Chinatown has really a street food mood, and this little restaurant fits like a glove in the spirit. I had a pretty basic noodle with minced pork. It was tasty and affordable. Will pass here to try the other restaurant suggestions.
5
If you go to china town, be sure to visit noodle man. Best noodles I have had anywhere in the world!! Not as cheap as some places in Chinatown, but you get what you pay for...
4
Located in the 'street food' area of Chinatown.
we went in for a quick lunch and enjoyed the visit, although it wasn't a highlight.
The lady serving us was lovely and the food was good, but not excellent
Worth a visit
5
Out of this world soup dumplings, fresh made noodles and a good sized and affordable menu with so many delicious things to choose from. We loved this place and will be returning on our way back through Singapore!
5
Great food at very reasonable prices. Authentic handmade noodles by the Noodle Man himself! While the house specialty is the minced meat noodles, their Hokkien noodles are delicious too. Other dishes to try include the hot and sour soup.
4
Stumbled across this after a few Tigers in Chinatown, and wasn't disappointed. As a noodle soup fan I wasn't disappointed and watching the chef make the noodles added a nice touch of theatre. Definitely recommend
5
Such a good find. On Smith Street in the walking street area, find this little noodle shop for a delightful Chinese meal. The server smilingly took our order and was as helpful as we needed her to be. We had the chicken chop soup w noodles, which was just delicious. Jiaozi (fried dumplings) tasted great. The kai lan(?) side dish was also fresh & tasty. Whatever pickled appetizer we were served was unexpectedly yummy too.Price for all this including fresh lime drinks was S$43.I highly recommend this little gem
2
We had some homemade noodles, which were actually really nice and the service was good as well.. however, when the bill came, we were wondering about the high amount... after we asked, she told us that we had to pay for a small (kind of) appetizer, she brought us in the beginning (we didn't ask for it and she didn't tell us that it costs something) and also for a bag of tissues (my friend asked for a tissue, whereupon she gave us a small pack)! That was a quite a pity, because the food was actually very nice
4
This guy is amazing and cooked some of the most freshes noodles I ever tasted. We were 6 persons sharing 6 different dishes, which were fresh and tastefully. The noodle man prepared noodles in front of us. The restaurant is simpel but very authentic. Friendly and quick service was provided by all time
5
Texture and taste was amazing. Minced meat noodle and chicken chop are the ones to try, along with Beancurd. I was surprised with the Xiao Long Bao as the stock and meat was pretty tasty. All in all, good service (the lady was very friendly and helpful), freshly made noodles with a touch of showmanship all in a vibrant neighbor hood. Superb experience
1
The food is expensive and the portion is small. Worse still, the sour spicy soup came burnt! The xiao long bao is disappointing too.
3
Nothing special. I was surprised at the high ratings. Steamed meat buns don't compare with quality I am used to in China town Flushing NY.
5
Ho my god
I walk past by accident and do this man literally
Making his own muddle and dumpling made of prawns or porc and combine
Fresh pasta with porc sauce
All was fantastic and so cheap I have returned
Already yum
5
Excellent as usual. Visited 4 times now and never been disappointed.
Very deceiving as it looks more like a cafe than a restaurant but you need to taste the food and forget about the hard seats. Always entertaining, watching the noodles being freshly made.
4
Wonderful Singaporean food. The noodles are fresh and home made. Whole family made feel to it. However, and I say this whilst on a long weekend.... There was a long wait. Everyone wanted to go here and it took ages. Other than that 5 star!
2
I live in Singapore and had a night staycation with my husband at a hotel nearby. Found this restaurant from trip advisor and thought this place must be good from its reviews so we gave it a try. Ordered dumplings, minced pork noodles, and some vegetables. The dumplings didn't even meet our standards, definitely not fresh. There are a lot of places in Singapore you can easily find to get decent dumplings. The noodles that people have been rating excellent were just so so to us, nothing special really. It wasn't really disappointing, but I failed to understand how these all reviews rated the noodles excellent. I begin to think they must be tourists. And yes all the guests who were eating there I could bet they are all tourists. Locals would never go to this place, apart from the price that is also too pricey for locals and the serving of the noodles was so small. The only good thing about this place was the service. The lady served us was very friendly. Regardless, definitely won't recommend any of our friends to visit this place.
4
This is a small place that doesn't really look much of a restaurant but the food is just awesome and it's relatively cheap as well. We had dumplings, home made noodles and rice. The noodles and dumplings were delicious!! The only down side is they don't give you a proper bill and we had bit of a wait (we were informed of the waiting time) Would definetely recommend if you are visiting Chinatown
4
Quiet, clean and delicious food. The homemade noodles adds to the freshness of the meals. I ordered the homemade chicken noodles and pork dumplings. Flavourful and fresh. One criticism is that there is no proper bill. The price of items are scribbled down on a piece of paper, so do your own calculations. Overall I would definitely recommend this place.
4
Of all the vendors and restaurants on Singapore's Food Street, this is the one that to me seemed like best value for money. Beer was the same price as outside but cheaper than in other restaurants, and although the menu was simple, it was certainly affordable.The waitress was fairly standard and I have little to comment on her service, though with the open kitchen it was great watching the chef make his noodles fresh from dough. What was even better was eating the noodles, once mine arrived.The menu described it like a pork chow mein, though I would call it more noodles in a light soup at the bottom of the bowl. The noodles were delicious and the pork well cooked, although one piece was still on the bone. The portion wasn't huge, but neither was my appetite or the price - they do also serve dim sum starters. All in all, it's definitely good value for money for some tasty fresh food in an otherwise expensive area; go here
3
Would give it a 3 stars. The service is great but do note on the hidden prices for the items they provide, so do reject the small plate of appetizer ($2.00) and the napkins ($0.50 each). food we ordered were: 鸡扒拉面 ($6.80)，鸡肉炒饭 ($6.80)，小龙包 ($8.80)，two drinks ($2.50 each). End up the bill came up to $33.50. When we enquired, we learn that they also have Service charge and GST. There are no receipt provided so prepare to do your own calculations
5
The noodle man sells his hand-pulled noodles for about $10SGD per person. Pretty decent meal, and he will let you pull some noodles with him and enjoy a photo op.
5
Sadly we only found this fabulous little eating place on our last day. Excellent value for money - delicious food - and lovely people. They certainly provide the umami experience - delicious savoury tastes. We will certainly be back now we know where it is.
5
Awesome and very well priced. Also, don't forget to try the dumpling, it's fantastic. The prawn noodle and pork chops was my favorite. The portion is Asia standard but don't it fool you. It's very filling.
4
Great tasting Pasta's and dumplings. Get a good serving with each dish and the fried dumplings are a winner. Certainly try their specials, we had the crispy chicken and it was really good with a great sauce.
5
Small restaurant in the dining hub of China Town. Very cheap. Home made Noodles. Extremely friendly staff. Cheap beer in comparison to surrounding food outlets, Air conditioned. I had the crisp chicken on Noodles with greens. So tasty and healthy. Hubby had prawn rice and he was impressed. There were many choices . I would love to go back
4
Visited here on a recommendation. Had one of the most popular dishes recommended by the very friendly & helpful waitress, it was first on the menu. Think it was noodles with minced pork! Very tasty, quite light though. I was glad we'd ordered deep fried dumplings for the table to share! Overall very enjoyable meal & great to see head chef rolling out noodles in the kitchen!
3
We had no idea that we were entering a "famous" restaurant. We were not too hungry so ordered small - noodles of course. Hubby enjoyed his pork chop noodles and the broth was yum but the noodles a bit floury. I was a bit disappointed with my prawn dish, mainly because there was only 2 prawns but the flavour of the egg noodles was nice
4
I really liked it. It's a very famous spot located in the food street at Chinatown. When you get inside you can see all the news where this place has been reviewed and also you can see the owner making the noodles (which is another point of interest). I don't find it super expensive neither regarding prices in Singapore. If you are around, go there
5
A great place to have your noodles and dumplings. All homemade by the owners. They are also the only one working there so you feel very welcome. The taste is perfect and with the low price they have this is for all. I will say even better than many of the fancy places you also have in Singapore. I will come again every time in Singapore. The area around the restaurant is also fantastic. A lot of other food stalls and busy life. Welcome to China Town.
5
We have been big fans of Noodle Man ever since we moved to Singapore 8 years ago, and cannot go past whenever we have friends or family visiting... Luckily they never fail us, the food is good honest handmade fare - their speciality obviously is the noodles but they do a really yummy fried rice and chicken chop too. I would definitely recommend this to anyone but especially if you have kids because they love watching the noodles being made. And if you make friends with the owner, you might even get your photo up on the wall - we did!
5
Went for dinner with family and had an excellent experienced with a fresh made noodle, great flavour and very good service.
4
Watching the noodle man is mesmerising. His skill at creating the noodles is world class - puts pizza base spinners to shame ;) They taste pretty good too
5
Went down to Chinatown to find the Noodleman and we were not disappointed. Watching him make the noodles was amazing, she made it look so easy. Also great to chat too. However the food was also great, noodles, dim sun, prawns, crispy chicken, pork ribs, all amazing. The 3 of us had a lot of food and all for $160 including drinks. Well worth a visit, will be back
5
It's an small open restaurant located in Chinatown Smith Street. Friendly staff, fast and excellent service. Fresh homemade noodles, the noodle man is a legend and you can count on him for a bit of entertainment, you can take a picture with him and your noodles too. Excellent food and good value for money. 3 years living in Singapore, this was my first time here and definitely I'll come back.
4
We are staying near China Town and with so many places to eat we had a quick look on trip advisor and found this little gem - Noodle Man. The staff were really friendly and the food was great. My friend who is a really fussy eater throughly enjoyed it too!
5
While wandering around Chinatown, we found this small cafe located in Smith Street, offering a range of dishes. The staff were very helpful and made a number of suggestions. Our food was very tasty. The cafe is frequented by a wide range of tourists and locals alike, always a good sign for any eatery.We will certainly make our way back to the Noodle Man when we are next in Singapore. Recommended
4
Hard to find but worth it. Noodle man is located at the end of Smith street. Nice little food place. Noodle man is proud of his place. He's been making noodles since he was 16 and he's like 60 now!! Nice dumplings and the beer is nice and cold. Well worth dropping in for a feed. Watch Noodle man make the noodles. Excellent
5
An amazing re-discovery led to dinner again at this incredible cafe/restaurant. In the centre of the busy hawkers stalls is a skilled chef who makes his own noodles. They are as fresh as fresh can be and really tasty!! We had visited Singapore 9 years ago and were recommended Lan Zhou La Mian (Noodle Man) by our walking guide. It was a long shot 9 years later when we couldn't remember the address, but there he was in Smith Street demonstrating his skills once again! We had the chop chicken, vegetable noodles and hand-made tofu (to die for!) with a couple of Tiger beers felt very satisfied. Very good value for money and the show of noodle making!! Go there when in Singapore
5
Visiting Singapore again this year, I took my family to this delightful restaurant I found on my last trip. The daughter and husband that live here and have never been, and my husband who is a bit fussy about what he eats! They loved it!!!! The small restaurant is easy to find on Smith Street and we walked straight in and ordered. Watching the noodle man making fresh noodles was fascinating whilst a very helpful and friendly lady helped with our choices. Simple but great food served promptly, and the price was very reasonable. Thanks so much
5
Hole in the wall in Smith St, easy to miss if you walk past. Serves simple, basic and tasty food - the noodles are what the place is known for but many other options also. The highlight is if The Noodle Man is in house, hand making the noodles. Great place to take visitors and he is always happy to pose for a photo
5
Unassuming front.... fantastic meal that even the kids loved.... crispy pork with garlic was so good we had to order more... watching the chef make the noodles is incredible, a real art... would recommend this to anyone who wants a cracking meal with friendly staff.
5
Try the vegetable noodle soup, it's so tasty and fresh. The homemade tofu is out of this world: cruchy and salty on the outside, soft and tasty on the inside. I went back the next say!
5
Wow, the noodle man is amazing to watch and the noodles are just delicious and great value for money. Recommended by a friend, my lunch here was a holiday highlight. Thanks to helpful and friendly staff.
5
We ate here twice during a recent trip to Singapore. The noodle man is located on Chinatown food street (Smith street), it's a small open restaurant near the end of the street.The service at this restaurant is excellent, the two ladies who take the orders are always friendly and smiling. During our two visits we tried the noodles, sweet and sour pork, dumplings and vegetables. The food is excellent value for money and you can count on the noodle man for a bit of entertainment, expertly stretching the noodles out in preparation of cooking them - yum!Don't miss this place
5
This is my 4th visit so it's about time I wrote a rave for this restaurant. Do not leave Singapore without eating here and do not leave this restaurant without ordering the Noodles with Mince and the Tofu Salad with Pork Floss. The noodles are made fresh in front of you in the open fronted kitchen and they are to die for. The noodles are thick and silky and the mince is rich without being fatty. And the tofu salad isn't so much a salad, as a half dozen cubes of lightly fried silken tofu. They are warm and melt in the mouth delicious. Can't wait to come back..
5
Recommended that we visit during a recent holiday. Such good food, we went back a few nights later. A small family restaurant with only a few tables and stools. Patrick is stationed up the back making his noodles and is happy to pose for a photo with guests. Of course the noodles are fantastic. But what I really loved was the dumplings. Fried dumplings are fantastic. And the steamed ones filled with pork that burst with a mouthful of beautiful soup when you eat them. Fabulous. Also out of this world chilli prawns. Must visit spot on any visit to Singapore
5
Noodles freshly made as you wait,the man is a legend and just to watch him making the noodles is entertainment.The food is fantastic,visited twice this year on our visit over there,and cannot wait to go back,although it will be a while.Food here is fantastic so much so that i never pick out food myself i just say to others pick for me because i know i will like it
4
Noodle Man is a tiny restaurant and one of the few in Singapore where you can see noodles being stretched by hand. My kids, always wary when I drag them to Chinatown because they are expecting chicken feet or swine throat, loved Noodle Man. Prices might be higher than a hawker center, but hey they are fresh, hand-made noodles! Go for lunch and avoid the queue. Oh, and get the fried tofu, even if you don't like tofu. Also home made and delicious
4
I have been going here for a number of years and even though i still love this place i think that when Smith Street was modernized the place lost a bit of its charm.However, Noodle Man is great and run by brother and sister, the service is good and the food is better, you need to try the soup dumpling as well as the fried dumplings but better that anything are the noodles and Noodle man (and sometimes his son) will make these fresh in front of you, this is a treat to watch and there is a real art to it. The pricing is a little bit more that what Iâ€™d usually pay for a place like this but still well worth it as the food is grea
4
We were remmended this place by friends and were not dissappointed... The dumplings are fantastic and the staff very keen to help with the menu. We sat outside for dinner however you can still see the noodles being made.Couple of things to note... cash only for payments and the bathrooms are a few doors down the street btu don't let this put you off
