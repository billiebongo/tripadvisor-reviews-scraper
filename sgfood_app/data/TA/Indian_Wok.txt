Worst Sevice and most unhelpful staff. They did not want to even help us understand what the ingredients are in the dish
1
The staff and manager at the restaurant have absolutely no idea how to treat regular patrons who have been coming here on a weekly basis for years. They are inflexible and do a terrible job.
Decent food. But stay away

A must try place for Indian Chinese food lovers .. right mix of spices and correct saltiness.. service was good.. juices are not mixed with sugar and right temperature .. all in all a very good experience!!

We decided to try this Indo Chinese restaurant. It was a full house, but luckily we managed to find a table. Food:The food in this restaurant is not bad at all. They are rich in flavour, well seasoned and balanced. It's safe to say, that if you order 3 dishes, at least two of them will have a decent good taste. I would also recommend the crispy fried spinach. It tasted really good.Also, all the dishes are served in generous proportions and there are plenty of option for both vegetarians and non vegetarians.Staff: The staff seemed unprofessional and untrained. With all the tables being occupied, they were having a real hard time managing the orders. To get two glasses in my table, I had to remind them 4 times. I am not implying that the staff is rude. It's just that they lack an understanding of the hospitality industry. You can tell a lot about their training, by the way they place the food on the table. This is one of the areas, where I would strongly recommend some improvements.Masala chai: Now this requires a special mention. I ordered a cup of masala tea. After asking for it 4 times, it was finally served to me. I didn't like the look of it. As as soon as I tasted, it blew my mind (not in a good way). It was the worst masala tea I have had in Singapore. DO NOT ever order that. Anyway, after 2 sips, I had to leave it there in my cup and try to get as far as I can from it. It was probably my mistake to order a tea here. Lesson learnt!Overall, my rating is 2/5, for the decent food and a service that could be a lot better

We went to this restaurant and we actually had decent food. I have no problem with the food but their service is basically the worst I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve ever seen. They have absolutely no idea how to treat customers properly. In fact I came here a few years ago and they did not allow us in because we were eating there after we finished jogging
2
Authentic Indian chinese, spicy, saucy, good helpings and reasonable price. All attributes for a good Indian meal.But, yes there is a big but. the staff is young and inexperienced, neither knowing the english language nor the in house menu. Awkward and ill at ease the joy of good eating diminishes with their faux pas.Yet, in Singapore if you yearn the Indianised chinese, this is the place to go.pepper chilly paneer, spicy prawns and shezwan rice are good. soups are a no-no. Go there only to eat. No ambience no service. Fill your tummy with the indian chinese taste and do not over tax the pocket

I have no complaints about the food. Whatever we ordered was really good.But the Aunties who serve there has a very grumpy face and rude attitude (except one.. but i don't know her name). They don't even have a smile on their face... They were soo loud. They were gossiping about the customers standing right there in their language thinking that no one around them would understand. Their attitude is the worst.I have been to soo many restaurants in Singapore.. from hawker centers to good restaurants, I have never noticed such behavior in any other places.Restaurants are there everywhere in Singapore... We can find great food in any corner of this country, but when you plan for a nice dinner with your family or friends its the place and service which matters on top of good food.The management has to learn this and they should definitely consider about changing their crew

The food at this restaurant is quite good. The best dish we tried was the pepper chili paneer. It was very spicy and appetizing. However the service was not good. The staff showed little interest to the customers. It took a long time for the food to come even though there were only two to three tables in the whole restaurant
3
Not a whole load of choices here but the food is ok with some spicy options for those with the taste for chilli peppers. The staff are helpful in explaining the dishes to those not familiar with Indian Chinese food. I went with work colleagues mid week at lunchtime. The restaurant was very quiet at that time. The portions are generous so it is easy to over order, but you can always pack leftovers, which I did.
5
Visited for lunch on a weekday. Nice ambience, not‚Äã crowded.
Food.... was out-of-the-world tasty!! Generous quantities. Very impressed with everything we ordered .. especially liked the eggplant main dish.
We were all vegetarians.
4
One of the few places where you get Indian Chinese cuisine, absolutely loved the food here. Normally priced as well.
4
overall nyc experience,love the most chilli paneer, want to visit soon.i think this is the only best indo chinese restaurant in east coast
4
The food is amazing, we have been here a number of times and really enjoy the food, especially the devils prawns. If you want indo chinese, try it, you will love it and keep coming back, as we do!
5
The best Chinese in Singapore . Loved the food . Loved the service. Joyti was the best . She really took care of all the guests and was very helpful . When there is good food & good staff the dining experience becomes awesome. Thank you Joyti for looking after us.
2
I have been to this restaurant a number of times the last few years and in the past I would have given it a much higher rating but sadly the food has gone down although this is redemable and may have just been the items ordered.The biggest issue is the service. Staff didn't understand orders, they too ages to bring simple items like drinks, there seemed to be a lot of them but you could never get their attention.I just would not go back ther
4
We have fallen for this place and order a little too often for home delivery! Love the honey chicken and our absolute favourite is the crispy okra with hot garlic sauce - sounds strange but really great! Go there, but not too much we don't want our delivery delayed!
5
Ideally located near Siqlap Center, the restaurant offers Indian Chinese food. You can get all the dishes you carve for like Gobi Manchurian, Chinese Noodles made in Indian style and many more. It is on the expensive side and wallet factor for 2 may run in $000+. The taste is good and portions large. So when you order, ensure you do justice. The service is great and quick, the place neat and clean. Enjoy if you love Indian Chinese
1
The worst food I ever had. Stale, soggy,tasteless, terrible. Spent over $300/- in this home delivery order and later bring guests to another eat out place after we tasted the food from Indian wok. Was a disaster ! Wonder how a restaurant can be so bad 
4
We visit this restaurant once every few months to get our fix of Indian Chinese food. Our latest visit was for dinner yesterday. The food tastes good, but be sure to specify your spice levels to avoid surprises. Yesterday we had sweet corn soup, chilli chicken and hakka noodles, all delicious. Service is strictly average. Quite hit and miss actually, depending on the stress the staff is under I guess. Like yesterday, the lady who took our order apparently forgot to key it into the system, so our meal was delayed by over 30 mins.Overall one of the few places which serves good Indian Chinese food.
4
Good Indian chinese good, with adequate vegetarian options. though the sitting is a problem over weekends. so plan accordingly
5
Pretty decent to hangout with Friends, Served Indian Chinese starters , Main courses along with Spirtis,Its value for money and you may not miss the taste of Indian Chinese while @ Singapore, Ladies staff members are so courteous.
1
The overall food is really bad. It wasn't the pleasant experience. I have never scene brown colour Hakka noodles..vegetables were burnt. Please don't even think about this if you going with a slightest expectation of having a Indian Chinese.Price is not very high but not worth of what you spend in terms of ambience and food.
5
While in Singapore we felt the urge to have some Indian Chinese. So we ordered a take away from Indian Wok. We found the food to be quite tasty and similar to the desi chinese that we all Indians love. There are plenty of options for vegetarian and non vegetarian. And they will tailor make the spice in the food to suit your requirements. The food was promptly packed and given to us and it was quite delicious

Anyone who loves Indian food should try Indo-Chinese food. I had some amazing experiences in the UK & thought I'd try this restaurant. We went in on a Friday night and noticed they were doing a roaring trade in Take Aways, but we were the only guests. In fact, only 4 others came in the couple of hours we were there.My friend asked me to surprise her, so I chose 3 dishes off the menus and told the waitress, why I wanted to point and not mention the names of the dishes. She was not impressed and could not understand why I wanted my friend to eat food she had not chosen. Honestly, this happened 3 times and then she actually repeated my order back to both of us. It was so surreal, that I wondered if there were cameras around filming this discomfort and confusion! :)Then the food was served with an attitude hovering between indifference to sullen. The food itself was excellent to be fair. But even in paying the bill the manager or owner acted as if I had disturbed his routine. Amazing!!I now know why they had more Take Away trade than real customers.This experience epitomised it
5
Being a thorough bred bombayite, I can just not do without my fix of manchurian and schezwan which obviously, is difficult to find in singapore...though many indian restaurants here do make their own versions , chilly chicken being the most commonly found, none of them quite hit the mark for me, until Indian wok happened..its been almost 4 years since we have been constantly dining in or taking away their food and it has never disappointed..
4
After a rather mediocre meal at a competing Indian-Chinese restaurant, I was skeptical. A lunch at Indian Wok changed all that. We were a group of 9 (6 adults and 3 kids). we ordered a rather wide variety of dishes, including traditional Indian-Chinese ones like Chicken Manchow soup, Chicken Chilly, Chicken Manchurian, Garlic Chicken etc. The taste was excellent for all. Service was good overall. Surprisingly they were taking last orders at 2pm, which is rather early for an Indian restaurant. The restaurant serves liquor too, which is reasonably priced
5
Had lunch there. Ordered hot and sour chicken soup, vegetarian hakka noodles and dry chilli chicken. This is not gourmet food, but the typical Indian Chinese fusion - most dishes unheard of in China, served together and greasy. The way I like it. Also very nice masala tea. There is an outdoor area you can use if you don't find it too hot. If you are alone, you can order half portions which is useful. Cost USD15-20 per person. Last order is at 2pm.Been here many times over the years and will keep coming back
3
Indian wok does a reasonable job on the Indian Chinese food ... the food was decent (one good, one average and one insipid dish) can at best get an average rating but repeat visits may change the opinion (hopefully for better) Service is efficient and the place clean
1
 deep fried stuff is REALLY deep fried and they serve you dish along with that oil. And the owner is so arrogant that he doesn't bother even coming to your table and addressing that problem. Atleast admit that! Springrolls are a big NO there. Soup was ok ! Expensive food, not worth.
4
If you are missing Chinese food you used to have back home in Pakistan or in India, this is one of the good places to go and satisfy your craving.
4
Pretty decent place for your Indian Chinese doc the staff is great decor is good and location works so all in all its doable
4
Last weekend had a craving for trying some indian Chinese food... which resulted us landing up in 'Indian Wok'. The food was really yummy, less oily and the service was excellent... would be definitely be going here quite often ...
4
I always visit this place when I feel like eating an Indian Chinese 1) Reasonable Prices for food2) Alcohol prices are cheaper 3) Good ambiance but some times it gets crowded and becomes noisy4) usual suspects - Drums of heaven, Chilli Pepper Paneer, Garlic Noodles, Manchow Soup, Sichuan Fried Rice and many other dishes are really done well5) Food portions are large and can be easily shared in 2 6) Pls try Lime Margarita (Frozen) - it's really done well (much better than most of the other places in Singapore)Make sure you do a reservation if it's a weekend!Things they could improve 1) service could be better2) last order is at 10
1
Overpriced and mediocre food. Drumsticks were raw in the center , how hard is it to deep fry. White maggots on the seat beside the table , when identified to server , she calmly said " the previous customer must have put it there " !I will not return even for a free meal.
4
Went here with friends who live in Singapore, and this place did not disappoint.The chilli paneer was delicious and nicely spiced. The service was prompt and the food came very quickly. Compared to Indian restaurants in Melbourne I found this place marginally overpriced. $6 for a lassi!! A good change fusion between Indian and Chinese cuisines. Enjoyed the meal with our friends.

We had reserved our table well in advance but on arrival we were ushered to a table at the back of the restaurant, very near to the kitchen and without any open view. Felt uncomfortable so we requested for a change of table. It's to be noted that there were only a few customers in the restaurant. The new table had a reserved sign placed on it, at the front of the restaurant and with an open view of the outside.We ordered veg manchow soup, chili paneer, veg Manchurian, hakka noodles, fried chicken and white rice. Must say that almost all the dishes had same appearance of dark brownish color. We requested our food to be least possible spicy but the actual food served was spicy. The paneer was very hard and the fried chicken was so so in taste.Hakka noodles were nicely prepared and so was the soup. However, the price of a bowl of white rice was a bit expensive for such an establishment.The service was fast and courteous.Would like to remain neutral for any recommendation
3
I would just say that this is an average place to go. The food is just normal except wantons which I would say one should never order. Our order had lot of salt and on complaining they did replace it but again the one landed on table was worst then before. Rest the smoothies and Hakka noodles are good to go for
5
We visited this place based on the reviews and recommendations of a good Indo Chinese cuisine. And for sure the food was great. All the dishes we ordered were very close to Indian's taste liking of Chinese food (Drums of heaven recipe can be tweaked more to taste closer to Indian Chicken lollipop). The portions were excellent. The service was great. When we ordered many starters the staff was very honest to tell us that the portions are normally large. He told us to order few starters in the beginning and later we can add. He was absolutely right and we didn't need to order extra starters. So appreciate the courtesy and very fair approach to customers. Overall a must visit place for some tasty indianised Chinese food
3
We went on a Friday lunch. Ordered a lot of food - Veg Manchurian, Schez Friend rice, Chilli Paneer, Fish, etc.The food was okay. For me, Mayura is the reference point and I would rate Mayura much higher than Indian Wok.The aroma was missing, Schz fried rice was below avg. Chilli Panner wast Chilli, nor tempting. Manchurian gravy was average.Traveling at such a long distance to ECP, I would rather skip Indian wok, nothing stood out. Service was avg. Everything was served together along with starters. By the time we began main course, it was cold
4
I have recently moved to Singapore and was badly missing the Indian Chinese food. Tried this place and found it just amazing. We liked manchow soup and panfried noodles. Would definitely visit the place soon
4
If you are missing the Indian style Chinese food you will love this place. I liked the noodles, Manchurian and fried rice. The Man-chow soup was also good
4
This is the place where I got to find really good Indo-Chinese food in Singapore. The service was quite good and fast.
We unexpectedly land there at lunch and were very happy later.
3
Didn't think the food was that great. Felt like they just batter everything up with spices and throw it in the frier and serve. Some of the service staff were also a bit 'blur'.
4
Coworker and I heard about how good this fusion was, and we were very impressed. Both veg and non-veg options were tasty and well presented.
Go there soon

When I first moved to Singapore four years ago, Indian Wok was to me - Great Indian food served at slightly upmarket prices! So it was reserved for special occasions!! Now Indian Wok service quality has dropped significantly!! They have very few staff taking orders and delivering on time! Plus the staff they have are very new! It's perhaps changing times, but the use of technology could help reduce 30% time in taking orders and standing next to customers!! The food still tastes good - but service quality still counts as priority for a restaurant
4
The food quality can vary a bit, but, for us east siders, its a great Indo-Chinese option Love their chilli garlic noodles, fried rice and chilli paneer. We usually stick to our regular order and always get a takeaway. Its a small place and can get super crowded.
4
I recently revisited this place (was a regular when i first lived in Singapore some 5 years ago) and was happy to see they havent changed anything, amongst the things that werent changed was the great food that i loved this place for intially too. we ordered "chilly friend potatoes, with Yong Chow fried rice and veg machurian" along with a bottle of red.we were thoroughly satisfied with our choices. just a note to anyone who would like to try this place, everything except their desserts is great. machurian : dry is better than the one with gravy - or go semi dry
4
Indian Wok in my opinion serves one of the best (if not the best) "Indian Chinese" food in Singapore. Located in a calm, serene environment, the hotel staff are friendly.You can make reservations by calling them in advance as well.The menu has a good variety of vegetarian and non-vegetarian delicacies
4
I have been a regular visitor to Indian Wok and firmly believe that they are the gold standard in this food fusion area. Their unique menu really stands out and their attention to detail in food preparation is a class apart.Always love their soups, black pepper fish, chicken manchurian, chilli chicken and gobi manchurian. The best part about them is the serving size provided. I went to a similar fusion restaurant and the serving size provided for the same price left a lot to be desired.Finally the icing on the cake is their sizzling brownie which literally sells like hot cakes. In Singapore, if you would like to be pampered, do visit this place to make your taste buds have a great experienc
3
This restaurant has an extensive menu and big vegetarian selection.
The food is a bit of a hit and miss. Some meals are very good and others we didn't touch.
Service is not great, but overall an ok experience.
2
Have been ordering take aways previously but this time decided to go by with a group of friends to celebrate my fiances birthday, good food but the staff behaviour and they way the talk aboslutely spolit the experience. Making unplesant face and having to complain loudly that one person did not turn up as per reservation and others did and why are extra chairs being put???? Absolutely a mess in terms of customer service. Would not go to dine in this restaurent again
3
The restaurant serves Indian-Chinese food. I found all the items decent but nothing amazing. The starters of chilly paneer and deep fried corn were probably the best. Service was good. The place is undoubtedly very popular as we went on a Sunday evening and the place filled up completely and there were people queuing outside . However, I thought most items could do with a bit more freshness and flavour
3
Till about a few years ago this restaurant not only used to be a nice fine dining restaurant especially for the type "Indian Chinese" preparation but a great way to spend family evenings. This time it was much less than that. We ordered the standard Jade soup, Chilly Chicken and Chicken fried rice. The preparation was average bordering on the side of common road side food stalls in India.The Jade soup was thick like a sweet corn soup, the chilly chicken lacked the refined taste of marinated chicken on a semi thick gravy- it was more served like a quick and spicy crispy stir fry in ready made gravy.... the rice was ordinary..... on top of that food was served on a cracked- etched white plate which was uncalled for. I pointed it out and the waitress instead of apologizing responded with a smile which almost reminded me of the Indian attitude of " This is how it is - take it or leave it" It almost seemed to me that the place must have changed ownership who were focused on milking the erstwhile reputation of the place by cutting corners further.... so when it came to pay a reasonably high price for the meals - the overall feeling was of dejection and disappointment.... this place may continue to have visitors in the absence of Indian restaurants in the neighborhood... but its high time the owners woke up to realities...
5
We chose this place for our anniversary celebration tonight and were quite impressed with their food and service. On request the food was made less spicy. Really loved the chilli paneer and manchurian. The best icing on the cake ( literally) was the sizzling brownie. Must recommended for Indo-Chinese lovers
2
We had heard a lot about the indo chinese food at this place and thought of trying. We are vegetarian and were hugely disappointed with the food. To start off with we ordered Veg Momos and Crispy potato and soup. Only the soup was ok (normal nothing exciting) but the veg momo's disappointed us big time. Crispy potato were super sweet. So our overall motivation to eat main course finished.Only good thing - because our friends used to go there frequently, the staff was quite friendly and prompt.
5
Awesome vegetarian food. Great taste. Fried rice and spicy schezwan sauce. Hot sizzle is kids fav. Amazing to watch their eyes twinkle when hot chocolate sauce is poured over cold ice cream. Sorry to break that suspense!!Definitely not to be missed. Late evenings it is many times full, so reservation would be good.
5
I am a great fan of this restaurant as it serves the Chindian food (Indo-Chinese). Catered to the taste buds of Indian Chinese lovers, Indian Wok serves a wide variety of vegetarian and non-vegetarian food. The best part was the brownie with ice cream that concluded our meal A bit expensive but worth the money.
1
The staff of this restaurant is extremely rude, insensitive and arrogant and for this even the Manager is no exception. They don't care even if you are regular guest. Thy need lot of improvement on customer service. The food is nice but visiting the rastrurant would not be a good idea instead can order food at home else there is other good restaurant Mayura in the same line about 20 feet away where u can enjoy good food and have a warm welcome as well

My knowledge of Indian Chinese food was very limited before I was invited to this place, by a colleague of my partner.This is Chinese food, with spices and seasonings for Indian tastes, and derives from food that had been prepared by Chinese traders and setller in India. It shares much of the cooking methods of traditional Chinese food, but with gravies and sauces with plenty of spice.A real treat. We tried several plated rcommended by our friends and, whilst all good and very tasty, the "Chilli and Pepper Paneer" was outstanding.Service is adequate and friendly, but we found the wine list to be only "red or white". Perhaps a more complete list will improve this restaurant.Booking ahead is required during weekends -the place gets crowded by local and expat Indian families, which in my book, is a very good sign for a restaurant
5
Indian Wok is amazing when it comes to serving India Chinese food. Best paneer chilly & manchow soup I have had in a long time. Its very popular & tends to get crowded in weekends ..so best to book table in advance.
5
if ur looking for Indian Chinese in singapore...this is the place for you...prices are a little high but when ur carving for Indian Chinese in a foreign land...its worth
4
This place has a good ambiance.
We tried Chilly Chicken Dry for starters.
As for main course we had Egg Fried Rice with Veg Manchurian Gravy.
Good portion size. Expensive but worth.
4
The food is super dooper tasty...good spread and fast service
Recommended dish:: Crispy Chilly Potato
4
We went to this restaurant in little India a couple of times and have liked the food every time. The food is excellent, ambience good and staff friendly. The siglap outlet was a disappointment though. It's a bit pricy but definately recommend this place to all Indo Chinese food lovers
3
Saw this restaurant a few times the look of the restaurant never quite made it to my mind to note that we have to try this place. Anyhow one day wife gets a crave for chindian food and had to try the food is no where close to the real Chinese Indian food it's average can give it a skip the staff was over whelmed by the crowd and couldn't quite gather themselves to do their best. I can skip it easily.

I had dinner here with some indian friends who stay in singapore and were keen to have some "indian chinese" food. To the uninitatied, Indian Chinese refers to a hybrid mix of chinese food altered within India by local chefs to align to the Indian Palate. Overall I had high expectations from the place as it was very highly recommended by a few local friends, but it turned out to be average. Being in Singapore, I least expected it to serve beef/pork - but it had usual dishes of lamb/chicken/fish on the menu. We had Chilli Lamb as main course, one chicken as starter and egg fried rice. The chicken came with the gravy and lamb was extremely dry - as if it was the starter and not the chicken.Overall I am not highly pleased, but also not highly dissapointed. I guess satisfaction is relative and the place might work for indian locals who miss home and also dont eat much of pork and beef
4
We have been to both East coast and Syed alwi branch, both were consistant in terms of quality and taste. Service i felt is slow.Good Indo-Chinese fusion food, decent price. We tried almost everything from soups to fried rice, choupsy's, chicken and fish dishes. Portion size is just ok but food is tasty and fresh.Nice place to have meal with famil
3
We were here on New Year's Eve. Restaurant took reservation and was ready when we showed up. Service was slow overall with wait staff appearing to avoid eye-contact to they were not called before they were ready! Food was good overall and serving sizes were adequate. Wait staff failed to tell us that the kitchen was closing and we could not order dessert that the kids were waiting for. They claimed to have told us but none of us seven heard it. Kids were majorly disappointed about not getting their brownie and ice cream on NY's eve, but the staff would not budge and did not offer any alternative desserts either
4
The food is great BUT only if you want Indian chinese food. Don't go if you are want Indian food. My family was slightly disappointed that the name said Indian but there was no Indian food. Check the menu first to avoid any confusion.However, in terms of food, this place is awesome. The food a bit spicy even if you order mild. So make sure you stress on mild food.
