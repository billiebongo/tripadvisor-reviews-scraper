We had a party with office friends of about 15 people.
The service was quick. Food was tasty and ambience was amazing.
Price was reasonable.
Sitting on the sides of Singapore river along with having food with friends was an icing on the cake!

Another very nice meal at Haldhi on Boat Quay. Go early and get a deal with a free beer or discount. :-) I always go for the veggie options - the paneer dishes are delicious and well filling.

Lovely ambience next to waters. Can see marvel of singapore- supreme court at one side, bank head offices and magical light works
Amazing food. Not very expensive. We spent 78 Singapore dollars for veg food for 3 plus tea :) and a tiger bear:)

The restaurant is located in a fantastic location in Boat Quay. It's a sheer joy to have dinner here at the edge of Singapore River in an open air sitting location. You can enjoy the evening having drinks and some quality Indian food that they offer.The food is really good. We order a mutton kofta which was really well prepared, The blend of spice was just perfect. Dal Fry was superb as well. Very well prepared with perfect Indian taste. The tandoori roti and naan were soft and well cooked. Over all the ambience is good and the staffs are friendly. The location of the restaurant beside the river is an experience of it's own. You can relax, enjoy the sceneries around along with good food

Great service, tasty food, in brilliant location.This North Indian cuisine Restaurant at Boat Quay located by the Singapore River offered great views of the Singapore high rise buildings, and had a lively atmosphere even mid- week.The service was very friendly without being over the top.A great experience and highly recommended

Absolutely loved this place. Sure, it ain't cheap. But the staff were superb, helpful and friendly. Our dishes were superb and we love our Indian restaurants. Sat on the river's edge on a magnificent balmy night overlooking marina bay. They assumed we would be ok with mild dishes and to be honest they could've been hotter. Top place. Will be back.

We ended up eating here as all the other restaurants inBoat Quay had closed their kitchen as it was a little late. The food here was nice specially the Dal Tadka which is the only reason this place got a 3 Star rating from me. The staff was courteous towards us but as soon as they would turn around and talk to each other they were just loud and uncivilised. One of them gargled and spat water on the road between the restaurant and the outside seating which is nobody does in a beautiful and clean city like Singapore let alone when guests are sitting & eating at your restaurant. I lost my appetite and we left soon after

Great northern India food with very friendly and efficient service. Nice river views add to the ambiance. The mutton Rogan Josh was very good as was the palak paneer. Music choice during dinner was the only negative, a more soothing music rather than Hindi disco would be preferable

It is difficult to walk along Boat Quay and to choose a restaurant especially with the touts trying to drag you in to them but this place is worth a visit. Their food is freshly cooked for you and the choice of menu pretty extensive. They do not try and upsell and the prices are reasonable. Very tasty food in a good position by the waterfront

Its on riverside...so the breeze is amazing. Food is awesome. Staff is wry friendly. They serve very nice north Indian food. In the evening, this is an ideal place to enjoy a dinner with light music and excellent overlooking Singapore river. With a cool breeze ofcoarse.

Superb food. Reasonable price and great service. Third time I have been. Never dissapointed.
They cook the meals to your taste.
Nice view over the bay as well.
Very clean and tidy.

Get a seat just by the river and ensure you're looking out over the river at MBS. The food is very good, especially the lamb shank. I love the onion salad too. Everything we had was nice and I'd gladly come back again.

Being right on the river, this restaurant has an incredible view. The sevice is knowledgeable and friendly. Plus the food is really delicious! I was a bit skeptical going in (the first time; we've eaten here at least 3 times now) that the food would be a standout at this location (very touristy). All of the dishes were delicious, in particular bagan bartha and mutton vindaloo. This spot is one of my faves! Good for couples and groups

Had been here with a friend as we were whiling away at Boat Quay.Had ordered Biryani and Roti with curry. The food was ok but lucky we found Indian Vegetarian cuisine on the banks. View was good.Food - 3/5Service - 3/5Overall - 3/
3
We were tempted in by the views and the fact that all of the customers were Indian, normally a good sign of authentic food. 2 beers, 2 curries, 1 potato, 1 rice and a Roti came to S$7 short of S$100. My husband really enjoyed his meal and mine was ok. The view was excellent,i guess that accounts for the high charges. Would I go back, no. Was it value for money, no. Did I eat my food and have a nice view, yes. You decide

Even though Indian food in Singapore is priced preposterously high, here's an eatery where the manager's warm smile & can do attitude make for a great dining experience. Their Biryani is fragrant & their curries have a good consistent texture. Their kebabs are average. Drop by here if you're at Boat Quay & if you feel like some authentic North Indian fare
1
The view from the Boat Quay to the Marina Bay is great. The food was average. But the service and the prices were really terrible. They tricked us by offering us relative cheap cocktails, but then demanded 20$ for a small basket of Naan (Indian bread)
2
Have been here a couple of times with friends as well as with family. Very ordinary food and super expensive. Ordered 1 chicken tikka masala and khile phool (aloo gobhi)- and the food was bland and tasteless. No blend of spices.I understand that one can temper the hotnessay to cater to the general audience which is quite diverse given its plum location on Boat Quay, but there are certain things that have been taken for granted- any onion-tomato mix does not pass for an Indian curry!!Except for the location- nothing much really. Especially when you have far superior north Indian eating places in Singapore.Apologies if I hurt regular patrons. This is my opinion

An evening walk through Singapore Riverside took us to Boat quay where history refuses to give way . Hence Indian restaurant is an exception here. Ambient location with the moon clad view of Parliament across the river. Vegetable and chicken pakoada were served as snacks. Butter chicken and chicken vinthaloo with roti and nan formed the main course. Prawns biriyani and mutton dry fry were added attractions. It was really nice to enjoy the masala tea watching the Christmas illuminated boats cruising around .Good food , well served at reasonable rates

Ate here while eating out with friends one night. Sat by a waterside table and enjoyed their pakoras, naans and curries. All of them were great eats! The restaurant itself is tiny and can cause claustrophobia but that is true for most restaurants on the boat quay. The external ambiance especially at night more than makes this a great place to have your dinner while you are in Singapore

We go to this place quite frequently as it provides us lot of options in Menue for every member in our group, food is little costly given the location, I'll say it's worth. Nice, courteous Staff.
5
If you like Indian food, this is an excellent lunch stop. Great value lunchtime pricing, excellent food in a great setting by the river. Thoroughly recommended.

Tandoori Fish was tender, jeera rice spot on. But beer is much cheaper 2 doors down. Cool location on a warm night.
5
The Food Quality is excellent compared to other dining outlets. Nice Riverside view and awesome location for Indians looking for super Punjabi Food.
The Dance bar at the top is not that great ambience wise but the sound system can really make you crazy.

Was introduced to this restaurant by a friend who is a regular here! That's why I guess, service was a tad better than what I've read in previous reviews in here! Surely V expensive but the food is authentic North Indian fare!! Had a lovely time for sure, though wasn't happy about cleanliness!!

We were walking along Boat Quay looking for a pleasant Friday night dinner. We stopped by Haldhi to check out the menu. As we were flipping pages looking for the vegetarian section, a server walked up to us and said, "No problem, I'll give you a 30% discount," in a very discourteous and brash tone. We were too taken aback to say anything and just walked off. Either the food is very over-priced there or he thought we found it too fancy - don't know what prompted his rude welcome, but I'm definitely not stepping in here ever. If a restaurant is going to charge an average of $18-$25 for a curry, they better train their service personnel. It also looks like anyone who is price sensitive (read, Indians or anyone else who know their Indian food?) will be given a 30% discount and others will be 30% over charged, which is terrible practice

We went for simple $10 set lunch for two people. The food; chana peshwari and bhaigan bhartha were delicious as were the two naans. We did however had to hunt down a waiter for the menu as we were ignored for a while even though the waiter had seated us. The drinks order was wrong so we sent it back. We then had to chase for the drinks later as they had bot arrived by the time the food came. The food delivered was wrong so we sent those back. When the bill came we were shocked by a bill of almost $60. So we sent that back. The food was nice and value for money OK for set lunch but certainly not worth the a la carte prices. Would we go back. No.

Sitting by the river watching the world go by and the fireworks, eating a good curry and a glass of cold beer - brilliant. Didn't go inside so can't comment on the grunginess inside - probably a good thing as we may not have eaten there. It was very expensive though - Â£50 for poppadoms, 2 curries and 4 beers - I know it's a tourist area in Singapore but .......

Visited Haldhiat Boat Quay, after the offer of a free beer tempted me away from my normal Indian restaurant there. The restaurant was quiet so I had a very nice table by the water, the food was good, the service was quick and the views over the water and onto the light show from Marina Bay Sands Hotel was excellent.This is the same review as I wrote for Kinara restaurant a few doors down because I ate there on the same trip and to be honest, I couldn't choose between them - very similar and very good

Get this all in perspective. Indian is not a favoured SE Asian cuisine. In Singapore, Little India is the location of choice for such food. BUT - a big BUT - this restaurant in a magical setting on Boat Quay is very worthwhile searching out. I have eaten here at least 20 times in the last year. The food is authentic (N Indian) and wonderful. I have always been disappointed in Little India, but never here. I have toured the kitchen and met the chefs. I have invited guests from humble to seriously influential: ALL are delighted. The Singapore River flows past at your feet: the skyscrapers loom over all with twinkling lights. The laser show is clearly visible and THE FOOD IS GREAT. Sit outside beside the river, relax in the warmth and eat really well. This is a place for those who enjoy the simple, wholesome things in life: a jug of Tiger, great curries and a real welcome
