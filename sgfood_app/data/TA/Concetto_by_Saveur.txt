Food was great and their duck confit is a must order. However the staff seems rather short handed and multiple request from customers can overwhelm their workflow.
4
Great location - in the heart of Singapore. Had the Duck Confit and signature pasta. Food was delicious and service was good. Good to go early as the crowd starts coming in around 6.30pm.
4
Duck confit, chilli crab squid ink pasta and sea bass great as always, but the prawn pasta was alright. Food took a long time to arrive and drinks served very late.
5
The prices of the food were reasonable, came in decent portions. Had the tiger prawn aglio olio and chillo crab pasta, both were delicious.
3
The Airconditioning very bad. Quality of food so so... taste wise very poor. Not value for money....
4
Been some years since I dined at Saveur. Went back specifically for the duck confit. It's of the right texture & crispness, yet not oily to taste. Certainly a place to visit for wallet-friendly quality duck confit.
5
Outlet is now just called Saveur at Cathay. Food is good as usual, though the ambience feels different compared to the other saveur outlets. This Cathay outlet feels abit more industrial/unpolished.
4
The dinner was ok ok. Had the chilli crab pasta and it was spicy. Overall good meal since we could use the entertainer app.
4
We had the Foie Gras for starters, which was very nice. Unfortunately, though it was not late yet, they had already run out of Duck, which we had wanted to try. The pepper steak was a bit small, but nicely done.
3
We wanted to try the roasted chicken breast but it wasn‚Äôt available on the day even though there were only a few mains choices available so it was a disappointment. Nonetheless the duck confit dish was ok for the price paid.
4
The crab pasta is üëçüëçüëç recommended to try it
All thanks to entaintainer app. So the overall bill is more worth it üôä
3
Service wasn't that good. It probably slightly below average as the service crew was not proactive and not easy to engage them. Needs alot of improvement.
4
I tried the duck confit, which was the signature dish. The meat is soft and tender, and the sauce is nice. Comes with a generous serving of delish mash potato. Worth a try!
3
1) It took a while to process our order as the restaurant was understaffed. 2) The food is generally nice. My wife and I ordered the duck confit. The duck meat is not dry and it's juicy.
4
Food is good. However, the pricr is considered high for the portion received. Place is comfortable for gathering and chit chat.
4
Enjoyed their duck confit, still as good since I first tried it a few years back. Pork belly is crispy on the outside, meat and fats spreaded out proportionately. Another dish to try is the Angel's hair starter. Highly recommended for friends and families!
4
Had a gathering here with friends. It was unanimous that the food was fantastic, especially at its price range. However portions were not big enough to be fully satisfying.
3
The overall food quality is average. Mushroom Risotto is good. Appetisers such as Truffle- fries is below average.
2
the Xmas set dinner for SAVEUR DUCK CONFIT- not tasty.. salty and the potato also different.
i still [refer the original one
2
I last visited Saveur many years and I recall being impressed with the food quality offered at the price point. Came back excited and was sorely disappointed. I ordered the duck confit. What came served in a plate was a piece of dry duck leg with a generous serving of uncooked potato. The dish also came with a lot less gravy than we preferred
5
Celebrated my friend‚Äôs birthday at the restaurant! Service was good, so do the food too! Will come back again (:
5
Yet another unknown number of time I‚Äôm here with my wife. Great food. Value for money. What else can I say.
3
Foei gras with affordable price but tasty. Saveur's pasta can be improved. Duck burger is a bit dry and too salty.
5
The food was really good and service was excellent. The chicken with rice was the highlight, and they have really good desserts as well. Will definitely go back!
5
Service was so much better off than the time I come. Most importantly, the staff are attentive and more willing to serve you. :D Food standard is excellent, will still prefer the outlet at Purvis Street.
3
Affordable french food, standard not as good as the one at Pervis St. The restaurant can sit easily sit many big groups.
2
Christmas set meal isn‚Äôt worth it, couldn‚Äôt fill up my stomach and I‚Äôm not even a big eater. Already was thinking about where to go next so I can satisfied my stomach when the main course was served - 2 thin slices of roulade. So sad!
4
Good menu choicen of starters & mains... need to add a few more choices for desserts though but what is lacking in choices in this department is made up for by the beautifully tasting Caramel lava cake. The duck confit, pork belly & the squid ink crab pasta are all very nicely done.
4
I dined here with my friends on a saturday night and it was pretty packed, resulting in a relatively slow service. Our food took more than 30 minutes to arrive. - The salmon confit came in a awfully small portion but I guess you're paying for its quality! The texture of the salmon was amazingly soft and tender, melting in my mouth with every precious bite I took. The lemon vinaigrette that came with it had a sweet and sour taste, which paired really well with the salmon! The only downside was that the portion was way too meagre - perhaps they could make this a main dish instead of an appetiser, upsizing the salmon and adding a side to compliment it. - The duck confit, considering that it was a signature item on their menu, was perfectly executed. The duck meat was fork-tender and delicate, with the right amount of juiciness. It is served on a fluffy bed of mashed potato pur√©e, saut√©ed mushrooms and orange segments. - The pork belly was served atop a substantial amount of "Gabure" french stew, with coco beans, mixed frozen vegetables, sous vide egg, and drenched in honey mustard sauce. The meat wasn't particularly memorable; it could do better with crispier skin. The french stew was average-tasting as well, and it got quite 'jelat' towards the end. - Truffle fries were served hot and crispy, but there was no distinct taste of truffle at all. The parmesan cheese shavings added a nice touch to the fries, but there was no dip to enjoy my fries with. I personally felt that this dish was rather disappointing. All in all, the food served here at Saveur is certainly above average and value for money, considering their affordable prices. If you wish to satisfy your french cuisine craving without burning a hole in your pocket, this might be a place you wanna consider dining at! :-)

They took some time to find my reservation from Chope, but it was understandable as we were still very early for dinner. The staff took our orders promptly and served us drinks (though payable) which were always refilled even when half-full. Food came all at once, which was abit uncomfortable - we had to eat the duck confit first otherwise it turned cold and leave the salads aside first. However, the chilli crab pasta and duck confit was really really good. It was our first time to the Cathay outlet, and I feel it fares the best out of the other 2 places we went (Far East and Purvis). The other downside was that the staff were crowding next to our table most of the time (while they wait for new customers etc), which is why ambience only 3 out of 5. Would still love to come back again, just in a different seat
5
Food was great; some of the best duck confit and most tender chicken i've had. Friendly staff and very comfortable atmosphere for a chat with friends. Decent prices too.
4
Had the dinner promotion set, the duck confit, salmon confit & pistachios panna cotta was really good. Though the onion soup was a little disappointing.
4
Reserved a place at Saveur for my mum‚Äôs birthday and placed in a request for a small cake surprise. They did so and my mum was really happy. The duck confit is amazing too! A must try!
5
The staff were extremely on point, they ensure to clear your plates the moment you‚Äôre done so you‚Äôll have a proper clean place to chill with diners.
4
Good place to have a nice dinner before catching a movie. I always enjoy the pistachio panna cotta. Would come here again.
5
Great place to dine with friends, with a comfortable environment. Food was great as well - esp the duck confit
4
Ambience was great and restaurant wasn't too noisy or cluttered. Mains was affordable and good, but standards of appetiser was soso.
4
I prefer the ambience of the Far East Plaza outlet; this one kind of felt like a cafeteria and didn't have have a very cosy or luxe feel. That aside, the food was fine dining standards - but reasonably priced - and was consistent with other outlets. Really enjoyed the new Egg Confit which was creamy and had a noticeable truffle flavour
5
Due to its peak hours, restaurant are pack with customer and I are being place to sit at ground floor. Everytime/whenever I wish to make order I have to go up the stairs to alert the waiter and waitress, they are not very attentive. Service actually quite bad
3
I was quite disappointed with the food this time round. Each of the courses were mediocre. We ordered the Foie Gras for appetiser - that was probably the only item done well. The mains of Duck Confit (disappointing - skin wasn't crispy, insides were a little dry), and Slow Cooked Roast Pork Belly (awful soggy skin, bland gooey lentils) failed to impress. The bill came up to $55 for two, and that's for 1 starter, 2 mains. Frankly, if I had added starter, mains and dessert - the cost would have been at least $35, and that is the cost of a fabulous set lunch at some fancier French restaurants in town. I certainly would balk at paying this sort of price for Saveur, a no frills casual diner.
5
Good food, great value lunch set! Nice restaurant setting, clean & bright. Staff are polite & friendly.
5
Food was awesome (I had duck burger- Yumz)
No queue even though we were a group of 7.
Only con: need to pay for water.
5
It was fuss free to book the reservation and once we got there, the staff attended to us really quickly
5
Service of the restaurant and the app are both efficient. Would come here again with family and friends.
5
Awesome service, lovely ambiance with great food. A good venue for birthday gatherings, quiet dinners for small group of friends or just a simple romantic dinner location.
4
Food quality is good and the set menu is really value for money. Serving is generous (my friends and I were actually full from the appetisers). Service is decent. Good place for a gathering with friends.
5
made a reservation through Chope for Saveur as im looking for a french meal before watching a movie, good service staff, good food and im giving the thumbs up, will recommend my friends if they are looking for french food.
3
Saveur Cathay. Food is not too bad. Restaurant ambience ordinary. I'll not purchase any voucher in the future. Went twice, still unable to utilise voucher. 1st visit, can't use with set lunch. 2nd visit, can't use on public holiday. Water is charged at 30 cents each. Not sure if it's per glass or free flow, insufficient information from female service staff
2
My 3rd visit since 3 years back, but that was in their Far East branch. Was a bit hard to get service, they weren't too attentive. Fair enough to say that it was Friday night and it was almost full house. 2 of our mains came much later than our friends. When it arrived the duck confit I had was not warm enough. My mash and mushroom were cold.. duck was not crispy. Sad. They were better in the beginning. Not coming back
2
We brought my mum to Saveur for her birthday. 1. The person who called couldn't pronounce "Saveur" properly. 2. Our reservation was for 7pm or 7.30pm and there was no beef dishes left. We weren't dining late and i believe most people go for the absolutely delicious steak or beef Bourgogne. We were extremely disappointed. Thankfully the staff were very nice.
3
Have eaten at other outlets so this outlet is really pale in comparison. Signature duck confit was cold and disappointing. Seabass was fishy and not fresh. Truffle fries was alright though.
5
Their duck confit & saveur pasta was on point. Serving sizes were very reasonable for the prices charged.
While the interior may not look as posh, fancy or inviting as the Far East branch, their food is as good if not better.
5
Staff were very friendly. Took the 3-course dinner set. Appetizer and dessert was very good and worth the value. Main course sadly was a disappointment. Still, price paid was affordable for the location.
4
Service was prompt and attentive. Food was tasty (as always) and good value for money considering the location.
5
Around 15 douby gaut mrt! It's hard to get cheap French cusine in Singapore! Love the duck confit and potato mash.. service staff was fast too.. lovely place will definitely come again.
3
The food potion is small and i feel food are over price but overall experience is average. Nothing bad though..
4
The other reviewers were spot on. The food was delicious. Definitely try the foie gras and salmon confit. I can't speak to the authenticity of the food as I have no point of comparison, but what we did have was hearty, tasty food that left us full and satisfied
3
HitReally liked the duck. It was well cooked and went well with the sides.MissHowever, the pork was a sore miss that reminded me of baby mash.I'd return again for the duck and perhaps to try the dessert, but avoid the pork at all costs
1
We went to the Cathay branch of Saveur. Glasses of water were not served, appetizers came AFTER main courses, horribly difficult to get waiter attention. Food was average, but for 50 dollars I can definitely get a much better meal elsewhere. All in all, terrible service and food that isn't worth the price. I wonder what we even pay the service charge for.
3
Service was slow despite the restaurant was quiet. Requested for baby chair but the table was not set up. Have to remind the waitress on the request. Taste of food was not on par as compared to other branches. Have to make multiple request for the ice cream to be served and the server was probably having a bad day
4
Saveur serves really quality Italian food at prices that are easy on the wallet. Must tries are definitely the Original Saveur Pasta (just $4.90 only üò±) and the Signature Duck Confit!
5
Food and ambience was good especially the foie gras and the pistschio pannacotta desert. Pork belly not so good but will try other food then next round. Service staff were nice. Thank you very much will definitely come back again.
4
The food here is surprisingly good. We tried the set dinner which came with starter, main course and dessert. We love the starters - the onion soup and duck salad. And the finale-
salted caramel lava cake and pistachio panna cotta. Attentive Service staff too.
4
It was a delightful dinner at Concerto by Saveur on National Day! Food and ambience was just right!!!
4
Business not very brisk, service was okay, food are fairly priced though comes in very small portions.
3
The standard of saveur pasta has deteriorated while the mains have met expectations. We had the Pork belly, steak, sea bass and the duck confit. (Listed from best to worst). However, the "star" of the restaurant had to be the Caramel Lava Cake. It had no lava. we sent it back but the second one was not any better. The taste wise was also weird. Texture was not crumbly like a cake at all. more like a sticky huat kueh
5
First time dining at Saveur with a big group. We got a mix of the dinner set and ala carte. Each course came almost together, including the main course. Service staff was attentive to us, as they noticed that we had a missing utensil without us informing them for one. The food was really good in general, except that one of the dessert was not available that might. The salted caramel lava cake wasn't as delicious as we hoped, but the panna cotta was really good. Definitely recomend the duck confit and sea bass there. The salmon confit for appetizer is really good too, definitely a try for those who like sashimi. Truffle fries was a little too salty to enjoy the truffle taste well. Overall good experience

Am not sure whether you have disabled the review function on your page, here's my share of my experience at your Cathay branch:Made an appointment via Chope on Friday at 12noon. Sat on the seats right outside the place, staff walked around, saw us, took their time and didn't open up the place till almost 12.10pm.Ate few times previously at the Far East outlet (FE) and was really impressed with the food. So we ordered 2 x Signature Pasta, 2 x Duck Confit with add-on soup & drink for one of the Duck Confit. Checked with one of the tall built with pony tail waitress whether I can use my Chope voucher, and was advice to show it to the cashier during payment.Signature Pasta came in a jiffy, my kids loved it, soup came shortly, but it was mildly warm, I expected something slightly hotter, since I was the first table there and food should be freshly prepared ?? Thereafter, it took very long for the duck confit to be served, but based on my experience at the FE outlet, good things are worth waiting for. To my horror, when the dish arrived at our table, it was a far cry from what I've had in FE, to begin with, the food wasn't even luke warm! The duck wasn't like what I have tasted, the skin wasn't crispy and the meat was like something that was grilled earlier and quickly heated up prior to serving, the temperature of the dish really spoilt the entire dish. I can't believe I've waited so long to be served with food prepared insincerely.To make things worst, when I made payment, was told that Chope vouchers cannot be redeemed during PH, I admit that it may be my fault to have overlooked the fine prints when I bought the voucher, but why didn't the waitress highlight to me when I was placing my orders! Totally changed my perspective of Saveur, all the best to the management
5
Went to Saveur at Cathay for my first date. Had to say the food was really good and value for money. Ordered the set lunch which was only at 22.90. Had the appetizer pasta(forgot what it was called) which was really good. Main was saveur's signature confit duck which was really well done too. Only qualms was with regards to the portion of the dessert which could have been a little bigger in portion. But overall was really satisfied with the food.
4
Was there with my friend but the service was bad. The waiter/waitress served our order late, sort of like mixed up our order with the table beside us and I was fuming mad for the long wait. Should have more staff when the place is packed
4
Taste not as good. Service is ok, however for Chope reservation/discount, the crew have to consult the manager, perhaps should train all to be familiarize with the system. More effective! Better customer service can be archive
3
quite good and cheap food in town. That said, most dishes are not available and it seems to be a recurring issue there
3
Have been a loyal customer of saveur and we ordered the usual favourites. However, portions seemed smaller and tasted a bit too salty. Overall still a decent exerience.
2
As usual when we reached the restaurant, we waited to be seated. At that time, the restaurant wasn't full house or crowded. Despite making eye contact with 2 staffs, we have been ignore totally. If staffs were busy, they could have given us hand signal and not ignoring customers standing at the door. As I have waited too long, in the end I had to approach one of the staff to tell her that I have made reservation and then taken to my seat.
4
I made a reservation for the earliest Saturday slot days ago but I didn't have to as many seats were available and not many diners at that time.I ordered their new herb chicken dish and it was super! Delightful flavour! Also had their signature pasta which was not bad either.I was however, disappointed that they no longer have a pasta heavy menu... ;( wanted to try more after my first visit years ago.
3
Used to love this place, not sure what has happened. Food was substandard. Sea Bass was not fresh and beef burgundy was watery and not seasoned well. Pork, Steak and Duck Confit was still good as was the hazelnut dessert but we used to find the food delectable and now it's just passable. Hope it was just an off day
5
Food is good, service is good too. Had a great dinner with friends there. Reservation process was easy and were allowed to sit down first and wait for others to arrive. Food was served quickly and the staff were helpful when we want condiments or a refill of water.
4
We were attracted by the affordable rates of the set menu and were forewarned by online reviews of the tiny portions only to be pleasantly surprised. The starters like the onion soup was a hearty portion, and the duck confit was substantial and tasty. It is already known as casual french cuisine so we weren't expecting to be wowed by the food and were satisfied with what we got. We met with a terrible mishap when one amongst us got her clothes stained by red wine and the staff at the restaurant had promptly come to our rescue and even offered us a glass of white wine (and further advice) to help with the removal of the stain. We are still so grateful for the assistance. Thank you

Had lunch with my daughter on 31 July 2017. Mainly because I had a $20 Saveur voucher. Just as well I had the voucher because with just 2 entrees and 2 glasses of water (@30cents), the total bill came to $38."Well that's affordable fine dining." one might say, Sadly, the only reason it was affordable, was it was not very fine.While my daughter's chili crab & squid ink spaghetti was tasty, the portion was hardly sufficient for a decent working person's lunch.It was a good thing she was a genteel eater so we both finished at about the same time. If it had been me, it would have been gulped down in 5 mouthfuls.Now to my duck confit. An objective description would be "The driest piece of duck's leg sitting on powdery mash, with a tablespoon of sauted mushrooms by the side." I'd more aptly call it 'duck counterfeit'.Perhaps the ambience, or lack of it prompted us to defer ordering dessert until later. So rather than risking it, we decided to look for dessert elsewhere. This turned to be fortuitous because we happened upon a great cafe in Takashimaya - but that's another story.Suffice to say, my first (and, I think, last) visit to Saveur was a great disappointment. Affordable? Yes. Fine? far from it. Sufficient? {stomach still rumbling)
1
We ordered the dinner menu. Firstly the duck in the duck salad wasnt fresh and there's a strong aftertaste after chewing on the duck. The salmon confit was slightly more fresh but the freshness is nothing compared to a salmon sashimi that you can find in a jap restaurant. My wife ordered the seabass and it didnt help to lift our mood in the restaurant. The dessert was the best dish for the evening. But it didnt help that for each course, we were serve a minimum of 5mins apart from each other. The dessert was a good 15mins apart, with my wife ordering a lava cake and myself a chocolate hazelnut. We understand this is a casual restaurant, we dun expect unforgettable food but at least just have the dishes serve almost together and not after 1 person has finish then u serve the other.
4
prices are quite reasonable and the food is pretty good
had the chilli crab pasta and the mushroom soup.
3
They had a few new dishes. The duck confit burger (new dish) was alright, but the duck confit main was not as good as I remembered. Shame.
Seeing it was a Friday evening, we were surprised by the lack of crowd too.
Thank you.
4
Authentic French food can be pricey in Singapore, which makes this place an absolute gem. The Duck Confit was delicious and very good value for money for the price
3
The service staff seemed inexperienced and frazzled. Half of the time the orders were mixed up or forgotten (had to be prompted before food was served). Duck confeitt was good though! Atmosphere was relaxed
5
Basically the food here was not bad first time experience to me was quite good! Manage to try their signature dish duck confit and truffles fries. Both was good
4
Food was good, enjoyed my meal. however, service was a little slow. it could have also been due to the fact that it was a Friday night, and there were many customers they had to serve. overall, still quite a pleasant experience.
3
Food was decent, not superb. Portion was really small to fill the stomach. ambience was normal......
3
The lady who served us was most obliging when we requested some changes to a dish which we appreciated. But the quality of our mains was below average. The duck confit was a tiny dry piece of duck leg. The beouf bourguignon was chewy, the taste was forgetable. The duck salad was quite good but v small. It's not expensive but not worth the trip
5
I chose saveur as the perfect venue for a dinner gathering with a group of friends so we can meet up after not seeing one another so often. It's my second time to the restaurant. One of the reasons why I like coming to saveur, is the sense of home feeling. I love how beautiful the ambience, design and decor is, very unique to each individual restaurant. Pricing is also made affordable. Knowing how crowded it can get on Fridays and weekends, I'm glad I still choose to reserve a table for my guests and I through the Chope app. It's helped me in so many ways. In saveur whenever I show my booking code, they already knew we were being expected there. With chope, I can always feel at home and at rest, and a feeling of closeness. Thanks to the saveur team for hosting us. will dine again at your restaurants soon. Date of visit - 7 July 201
2
Went to visit Saveur at The Cathy few days back. Their signature pasta used to be one of the must order starter at Saveur but now the standard has dropped. The pasta taste blend and their duck confit was so salty. Overall quite disappointed with the food.
5
I had a very pleasant dining experience at Saveur together with another couple. Very satisfied as they serve value for money food along with very good service and atmosphere.
4
Had the set lunch which was pretty good, especially the saveur pasta and the duck confit. Dessert was not bad too.
4
Reservation was made and confirmation call was rec'd within half an hour. Service was good and food is nice.
3
Very crowded place which I am unable to understand why. Food was so so but service was not too bad. For the price I think it's reasonable although not fantastic
4
restaurant is crowded and the seating arrangements provided is not well thought of. Overall food is slightly above average.
5
Went there during Monday lunch time. Not too crowded and service is good. They serve the next dish only when we finish the current one. Food is excellent as per usual
4
Saveur offers good French food at affordable price. Love their pasta appetiser and duck confit main dish. Worth returning again.
5
Decided to do a casual belated birthday lunch with a close friend. Lunch set always a good choice at a reasonable price of $22.90. We chose the Saveurs Pasta to start and it always lived up to its tasty reputation. Had the pork belly for the main and friend had the duck confit. Both wonderful and executed well. Only disappointment was the creme br√ªl√©e which one has to top up $2 for instead of the dessert of the day (vanilla ice cream). Well it wasn't the taste or quality that bothered me. Both my friend and I preferred the creme br√ªl√©e as our desserts when our orders for appertiser, mains and desserts were taken at 12:30pm. Our nice server came back at 12:32pm to say that they only had one creme br√ªl√©e left. No. Seriously? There was hardly a crowd at 12:25pm when we sat down. And the creme br√ªl√©e was out??? Oh well. I took the lacklustre chocolate ice cream instead. Minus the creme br√ªl√©e fiasco, it was still a very enjoyable meal as always with prompt service
4
Food was mediocre but portions were just nice. I felt that the caramel lava cake with vanilla iceream did not justify the $12 price tag, excluding gst and service charge. However, the starters and mains are good for better quality food with a lower price tag. I feel that the standards have dropped since the last time I went there
3
I went for last Friday lunch. The food is served 15 min after order. Quality of food is good. When we left, an honest staff ran out to return $2 note to us which he found on the floor. It was belonged to one of my colleagues there. Thanks for the honesty.
5
The chili crab pasta was delicious. We also tried the salmon confit, pork belly, and duck confit burger. They were all very good.
The staff was engaged, and attentive.
2
I loved my food experience at another branch of saveur but this was nowhere near the same. The beef was dry and the pasta was average. The mocktail was tasteless. The server was new and didn't know anything when we asked her about recommendations.
3
This is the second time i tried Saveur but first time at Cathay outlet.
The food portion is rather small.
3
Affordable price and acceptable food. Staffs are too busy handling the crowds pretty hard to get the attnetion of the staffs.
4
love the duck confit and the angel hair pasta. the wide variety of desserts are also consistently good. we like the salted caramel lava cake the best
3
1 starter and 1 main that we order were good. But the pasta squid ink is like chinese food, rather than Italian food.
4
Food is was delicious but I find that the duck confit was slightly more salty than before. Other wise, the saveur pasta is still as good.
4
It was a yummlicious dinner for my bestie's birthday. So glad she love the food & was so delighted. Definitely will be bck again soon.
4
great value for money and definitely one of the better duck confit i have tasted. only downside was the location, hard to find parking.
5
The service was good, the quality of food was consistent with other branches of Saveur with reasonable waiting time.
2
Got the chilli crab pasta - taste was great but the portion is so small and not even worth the promotional price. Pity as the taste was quite good.
4
Ordered duck confit, truffles fries and new addition in their menu - chilli crab squid ink pasta! the pasta was awesome, with the addictive sauce. worth a try!
3
The meats were done very well. The Duck confit and pork belly were crispy yet tender on the inside. However, I did not like the soft mushy stuff that the crispy pork sat on. The signature spaghetti appetiser was interesting and quite pleasing.
3
Had the 3 course lunch set on Good Friday that only cost around $23++, which is very worth considering the location of this place. Food was alright and decent, service is a bit slow though.
3
Food was delicious and good value for money but I was annoyed by the inflexible Chope voucher redemption policy and so won't be patronizing again.
3
we ordered all mains and some side dishes and the pork belly sauce was simply bland and another main dosh (fish) was not fresh enough and has a fishy smell.
3
The steak was really salty, so were the fries. The other mains that we ordered was the duck and it was okay.
3
The food is so so which is below our expectation, as compared to previous experiences in other outlets.
5
Staff were friendly and helpful throughout the time we were at the restaurant. Loved the signature duck confit, as well as the appetizers (foie gras & truffle fries). A wallet-friendly restaurant to visit if you are craving for nice French cuisine without burning a hole in your wallet. :)
4
We went to enjoy Saveur's 6th Anniversary promotion but was told that we need to order 1 main a la carte meal in order to qualify for it (besides having a birthday girl). We chose to have the set dinners instead & the manager graciously gave us free drinks. Service was fast & efficient though the main course, their famous duck confit, took a little longer probably due to the large number of orders.The chocolate & hazelnut dessert was really good but we were all too full to finish it
3
Food quality has decreased from the first time we tried. Quite disappointed. Duck confit was not as good as before and that's what we came back for
4
Generally their menu price is at a lower end as compared to other restaurants. However, they serve very nice food. Value of money!
5
Had a great dinner at Saveur Cathay. Our favorites are always the Saveur's Pasta (was done much better this round then before), the Duck Confit and the Foie Gras
1
Pretentious French food with poor service. Served next course with no regard for customer whether they have finished eating. Small tabless not meant for dinner plates.
5
Great ambience and food served. The choice of main courses are limited, however the quality of the dishes are overall quite consistent. Recommended to-go place with your date!

The service was all right, and the foods did arrive quicker than we expected. The taste of chicken broth and mushroom were not bad, but not the pasta. However, I'm satisfied with overall service and waiting time.
5
Food and service is excellent.
Friendly staff.
Food is served promptly
Very reasonable pricing as well
3
I've dined at Saveur many times at different branches and I think an issue with it is inconsistency. The pork belly I had here was alright but the skin was hard to chew on (as opposed to crackling skin I had previously). One point I have to make is that though the food is very reasonably priced, the glass of wine I ordered was very little! It was definitely less than a standard serving
5
Food was good as usual, foie gras, duck confit, the salted caramel lava cake, all worth eating again. Ordered the 3-course set dinner, definitely worth the money.just that it was abit squeezy as they tried to put us in between 2 noisy tables. not sure why they dont like to open up their other space at the basement, but squeeze everyone at the top entrance level
3
The restaurant had ample space and a good place to hang out with friends and family. They were sensitive to customers' needs. Like calling us and informing us that they had only very limited food left because of an earlier event. Although It was only 7pm. All 4 of us ordered the ribeye steak (all medium rare). The steaks were medium and not as juicy and succulent as what we expected. However, I must say they actually do try to deliver reasonably priced foo
5
good experience to lunch @ Saveur on a Saturday afternoon. staff very attentive and courteous. food is really money for value.
4
Very nice environment, convenient location with very delicious french food at reasonable prices. Will definitely visit again
5
Together we ordered the mushroom soup, salmon confit, seabass, duck confit, pistachio panna cotta and the salted caramel lava. All didn't disappoint.
The only down point was we had to constantly ask the staff was our water to be refilled.
4
Duck confit was good, recommend it. Sea bass was ok. The service was excellent as they constantly refilled our glasses and served each course immediately after we finished our food.
1
We got in at around 6:50pm on a Friday evening. We ordered our food quickly, before the crowd got in. We have got our main dish (duck confit) only around 7:20pm. In the meantime, the couple at the next table got in after us, got their main dish (duck confit and beef), and had almost finished eating by the time we got our food. We asked the waiting staff to check a few times, and each time they claimed that our food was being prepared.BTW, the chope voucher can only be used for a la carte items. Can't use for set menus
2
Used to patroniseat their first Outlet at purvis street. Much as we had to queue for a long time, the wait was very well worth it.. menu has changed and the popular dishes were either removed or didn't taste as nice as before.. sorry last visit
2
Second time here because the first time round I misread the terms and conditions of the chope voucher and ordered the set meal. This time round, the service of the stuff wasn't very responsive or friendly. Didn't feel very welcome by one of the female waitresses. Food was pretty bland especially the sea bass that I had. Funny how the potatoes had more flavour. The pasta appitiser was the only thing worth the money out of everything I ate that day.
4
We have eaten here many times with friends and colleagues who are visiting because it is at a convenient location. Food and service is always reliably good and they have affordable set lunches and dinners with portions that are a good value for french cuisine in singapore
4
Saveur is one of my favourite local chain restaurant in Singapore.They are specialised in French food with pocket frendly price.Love the Saveur pasta... it is soooo yummy. The duck confit is also one of my favourite and the meat is so nicely done and tender.As for the dessert, i would recommend the PISTACHIO PANNA COTTA!!! So smooth and delicious.Pls keep up the good work
4
Went there last Sunday for the first time. So had many questions how the promotion works. Was talking to the junior staff, thus she said she will check and get back to me on the questions, which was fine. Was going to order the chicken then they mentioned that the chicken and steak were sold out yesterday. Was wondering how come they didn't stock up for today as well. Luckily I am fine to order the other choices.. but was hoping to try the chicken though. Pleasant experience there. Hope to go there again soon. Thank you.
4
Had the set meal, service was gd but waited for a while for the food. Other than that, it was perfect, highly recommend!
4
Good value for money food . One of the best pork belly dish ever tasted ! Will definitely be back again !
4
Affordable casual french food around town. My friends always order the duck confit (tender and flavourful) while I always order the Saveur pasta. It's meant to be an appetiser but I will order two portions as a Main
5
Love the duck confit!!!!!! The dessert menu always changes but the pistachio pans cotta was good too
4
First time at the Cathay outlet. We ordered the Saveur pasta (it is never complete if you did not order this), mushroom soup, seabass and steak frites (medium rare). ALL were super good. Highly recommend the seabass and steak. I am still drooling typing this.
4
took too long to serve, waited 20 mins for dessert. service not up to standard, staff were unfriendly.
2
Waited for an hour for my main course. Checked with the staffs 4 times, all staffs said that they had informed the kitchen. Spoke to the manager and realised that the kitchen missed out on our order. The food was served an hour fifteen minutes later.
4
Made use of their ongoing $1 pasta promo (with purchase of any mains). The duck confit with truffle mash (+$3) was really great! Tender and succulent duck leg meat on a bed of creamy mash (apparently the truffle taste was pretty mild though) served with orange slices and sauteed mushrooms. The signature saveur pasta was not too bad but not as great as I've expected. Also ordered the salted caramel lava cake for desserts which unfortunately was a disappointment. There was barely any hint of saltiness that it could be easily pulled off as a normal caramel lava cake D:
5
I always enjoyed the Duck Confetti on their menu, which is a must try. I must say this is a decent place to go out with dates, well not to forget to mention, the affordable price tag. If only they could come up with more innovative quality dishes for a twist
3
Food was almost tasty, except for the duck confit that was a little too salty for me. The dessert was fantastic!!Service did not do justice to the good food offered. Serving staff don't quite want to do what they should. Appetizer only came right before dessert, despite several reminders. The staff just didnt bother to follow up.
4
I love the duck confit and the salmon confit at saveur. The salted caramel lava cake is also delicious!
5
Whatever else you order, don't miss out on the foie gras (fatty liver). Price has gone up but it's still the good ol' melts-in-your-mouth fatty liver that complements any set meal.
3
Prices are pretty awesome for French cuisine. But we were not particularly wowed by the food quality. But I suppose u get what u pay for.
4
Good food. Value for money. Convenient location but ambience inside the restaurant could be better.
Good service. Nice music
3
Decent and value for money French fare in downtown for all ; Friends get together , gathering in the week .
5
Had dinner here and the duck confit and mushroom aoup was gd! Will be back again for another visit next time.
3
10% vouchers not usable with set meals. So the vouchers are not worth it. Duck confit is really good! But the rest are average only. Staff did not even inform us that plain water is 30 cents and assumed we all want it.
3
The service was quite terrible during our visit. No one was trying to serve us until we ask for it. I personally walk to the counter to order food as the stuffs pretend not seeing me when I raise my hand. Plus, no one was trying to entertain us when we first step into the restaurant. Food quality was average and nothing to be impressed. Will not pay my second visit to this restaurant.
5
Saveur makes French food affordable while offering great taste. The dinner sets included appetizers, main dishes and desserts, which were appealing, but we ultimately chose to order a la carte entrees and shared appetizers because of the discount from an e-voucher we used. Also, located on the first floor of The Cathay facing the street makes this restaurant easy to find. Plus, the wait staff were so friendly and helpful in answering our questions
3
The overall layout and atmosphere of the restaurant was great. Loved the simplistic design and the open ceiling concept. The staff were friendly and service (including food serving speed) was good. Only let-down however was the quality of the duck confit which I ordered, the duck felt a bit dry and the mashed potato had a cheap taste to it
3
Came in 20 mins earlier than reservation timing for dinner at 730pm. There was a table clearly free for 7 people but were asked to come back at 730pm. Staff serving should be more flexible to serve the need of the customers.
5
Dined here a few times and food quality has always been consistent! I Will be back again! Yummy food!
4
Had the lunch set of 3 items. The food portions were just nice. The pasta was well done and yummy, the duck was seasoned well.
3
The food was well presented and was delicious. However, seabass was a little too dry. Dessert was not served with cutlery.
4
Had the duck confit and pistachio panna cotta. Both were excellent albeit the small serving size. White and red wine are affordable at $9 per glass. Excellent service as well!
4
I pop by many Saturdays after a long day which ends in church opposite. In a sense the laid back atmosphere is a plus when you want good food in a hurry. Recently they started the set dinner menu which is good value for money. Today I had the foie gras with grapefruit, a generous serving and the grapefruit a nice counterpoint to a nicely seared liver. The beef short rib braised with red wine was a fairly small portion for me but melt in the mouth tender. Desert of the day was to be chocolate tart which they replaced with vanilla ice cream but where nice enough to change to a refreshing lemon vinigrette salad dotted with olives and hazelnuts which was good with the heavier meat I had chosen. All-in-all a good meal for $29++ so yes I came back again!
3
Used to frequent this place when it first opened. Food is still value for money however standard has dropped. Cooking of the food and taste has dropped from what I remembered it to be and so has the portions. Still a value for money meal, but not as great as what it used to be.
4
Went for dinner with a group of 7. The ambience, large floor space and comfortable seating was nice and we l had a great time. However the price of the food has sure gone up, when 5 years ago, the duck confiti used to cost $8.90 as compared to $14.90 now. Also, the place seemed understaff with only 3 service crew for 2 floors.
3
Having been to Saveur since its beginnings as a stall in Tanjong Katong Coffeeshop, it has come a long way. however, the expansion seems to cause some quality of food, roots and values to be eroded. Other than the food whose quality somewhat is not comparable to the good old days, Staff were also incapable of being customer centric when dealing with the credit card promo, which really ended the dinner on a sour note for my friend who was footing the bill. Definitely higher standards are needed for this restaurant to stay its course.
2
Reserved a table for Christmas, as I enjoyed my previous experience at the restaurant. However, the recent visit was disappointing - chicken consomme was too bland, "medium-rare" beef was almost raw and the plate was full of blood with a charred sides & the lobster pasta tastes like your usual $3 hokkien mee. Their signature duck confit would have been a much better choice
3
Food serve was a lil slow. But overall ok. Atmosphere was ok a good place for gathering. Will still return.
4
Value for Money French Food. Service is a tad slow though. They seem short handed.
But the food is good for its price.
Had the duck confit. Mash potatoes were smooth and duck was tender.
4
Went on a friday evening. Quality and portion of food are excellent. Just a bit noisy on a busy evening. Overall very satisfied. Thanks Chope for the instant reservation service online.
3
Supposed to be the place for cheap french food but prices have been creeping up. Suppose will be better topping up the extra to dine at a legit restaurant. Still tasty nonetheless
5
Food was very delicious! Service was alright but could be better. Would still come back for another meal!
5
Went with a group of 6 adults and 2 kids, chose this place as it's kids friendly. They provide baby chairs and kids cutleries upon request. It would be better if they serve kids menu. Surprisingly it's a bit quiet, which my friends and myself like so that we can have proper conversation.
4
This is my 1st visit to Saveur. I enjoyed my set dinner very much. All the 3 courses are well prepared. Particularly enjoyed the foie gras appetiser and the beef short ribs. Good value for a French meal. We were pleasantly surprised to be asked if we enjoyed our meal. Good that the management valve our feedback
5
Enjoyed the food, good ambiance. We had the set lunch. I had the Saveur pasta, which is very yums. For main course, the famous duck confit and for dessert, they ran out of vanilla ice cream which was in the set, but they replaced with something even better, chocolate mousse with crushed nuts.
3
The food was good as usual, but the service, not so great. It felt like they didn't know what they were doing. 5 of us ordered set meals, but we only got 2 out of the 5 drinks and 1 out of the 4 desserts we ordered. Every time we asked for them, the staff would punch it into the system like it was an additional order before bringing it. Needless to say the bill was all wrong. Had to do the correction for them, the cashier had to print the bill 5 times before she got it right.
3
Overall food is not so bad. We arrived at 7pm Sunday, most of the signature main dish were sold out. We were not told that the kitchen couldn't prepare truffles mash before we ordered it. After clarified with the staff, they mentioned that the waiter earlier may be not well trained due to she is a temp and offered to compensate to us. Since she apologised sincerely, we don't mind having back the same dish without refund. Even though our dining mood was not affected, I found that it's not nice to have twice disappointment for customers 1) most of main dish sold out, 2) wrong food served, which the management can look into it to improve
2
Service was really bad and they charge for plain water at $0.30 per cup. Tried the duck confit -- good value for money but it looks like the restaurant was severely understaffed on a Thurs night.
4
We had the saveur pasta, lamb shank and duck confit. Service was good and food was served fast as well. Consistent quality
3
Dining at Saveur was average. Service still consider so-so. Truffle fries taste not strong enough. Price wise also average.
4
Value for money but the service is slow. Small layout and selection is not large. Certain items are not available
4
The food is a bit salty. Waitress who served us put on a smile. When come to food serving...not a single staff ask us whose food it is. We have to swap ourselves.
3
Food is good, not fancy sort but tasty. Portions were ample. Great value of lunch set.
Service really need to be improved. Staff are not very attentive, and lack of service knowledge. No major complain but was just observing.
5
Food was great, service staff very friendly. Reasonable price. The outlet was easy to find. Ambience was nice.
3
Not sure if the general Saveur quality has dropped just this outlet. We had the Saveur pasta which was cold, and they ran out of a few items because of a problem with the truffle oil. This made the used-to-be amazing mash potatoes served with the duck confit disappointing. Got the milk & cookies dessert, which was a fun dessert but portion was just too small for $9.9. We also tried to use the Chope voucher, but I would not recommend it to anyone because it is just too restrictive, being invalid on public hols and the eve, and only valid for ala-carte items. They wouldnt even freaking top-up of $4.5 for the ILT and soup, and you can also forget about the daily promotions
4
Had a nice date with my boyfriend, there was 50% discount off the starters. Unfortunately, they didn't give me the discount (I found out only a day later).We ordered the mushroom soup and Saveur Pasta as starters, which both were good. The Beef Short Ribs was small, but surprisingly filling. My boyfriend could not finish the steak. We topped it off with pistachio panna cotta which is good for sharing
3
Our reservation was 745PM, we reach the restaurant at around 715PM and request for an early check-in as we saw the table that was reserved for us available. We understand that our appointment time is not up and the restaurant reserve the right to let us in only when the reservation time is up. However the staff who attend to us is very rude in her reply. Regardless of what enquires we enquire, she gave us a very black face and only replied us that our reservation is at 745PM so we cannot sit in early. Hence we strongly feel that the respond and service provided by this female Filipino staff could be better, as if we did not remember wrongly, she is actually a managerial rank staff. Other than this, the overall dinning experience was pleasant
4
The dishes are delicious; and they are nicely presented on the plates; Price wise they are affordable; French food.
However, they serve the main dishes just we starting to eat our starters. And that's bad timing.
4
Great dinning experience, will visit with other friends too,
Must make a reservation in order to secure a seat
4
The ambiance was good with trendy music going on. A little crowded but wasnt that bad. Food was excellent thou
1
I walk out feeling like I owe the restaurant something. Will never go again and won't recommend to anyone. Food though good, service standards are worse than a canteen!
4
Value for money for the duck confit! They revamped their menu end up I preferred the previous pork belly thou. The creme brulee was excellent too!
5
Dined here a few times and the food and service is really good! Love it and will definitely visit again!
2
The mains and pasta we ordered are good but the sides of Truffel fries and soup are less impressive.The promotion basically give a feeling that the company want to give but don't want to give, For example, chope vouchers cannot be used with promotions (luckily we ask before purchasing the voucher), if get combo then can't get the promo price, promo only applies to lower price items which is the usual practice.Atmosphere is so so and almost like fastfood restaurant feel, waiters are not proactive.Feel that overall even though some of the food are good aren't worth the price
3
Good to get the choke vouchers if you are making a booking through chops, that lets you save $5 from $50. The food is reasonable for its price but don't except high end French food. The foie gras could have been better though! The taste was a bit strong at times, and it didn't really melt in your mouth. The sea bass was also a bit too salty and fishy.
4
French food not necessary to cost a bomb, Saveur is a good place to enjoy decent french food at affordable prices. However, I find their set menu are very inflexible, everything cannot change! from food to drinks to whichever. What if some don't take certain kind of food and drinks
4
Heard about Saveur and gathered 3 friends to try the food at The Cathay outlet. Firstly there was no set lunch. To be fair, it was Monday and the menu had JUST changed. But there was set lunch available when the reservation was made. oh well. Just my luck Secondly, it seemed that 40% of the menu wasn't available- very strange. we wanted truffle fries- not available. so were the pork belly, seabass, beef short ribs, etc etcFood was good for those available dishes we ordered.was a birthday celebration for 1 of us and the staff were ok to provide a candle for 1 of the desserts.
4
You won't get disappointed at Saveur, good food with good price!!
Menu variety is not wide but they know what they're doing.
Somehow the set menu is not served today but they offer S$4.9 top up with salad/soup & drink for your main.
3
The place is cosy. And the food standard is the same as Purvis and Far East. One of the server is quite attentive, when my friends finish their wine, she came over to serve them without us asking for any help.
3
Reasonable priced set lunch . but food taste abit salty then usual visit. Will be good if Saveur's can look into this and provide customer a healthier dining meal.
5
Food was nice as usual. No waiting time required as we have made the reservation earlier. Great experience.
5
Been twice and both times were great. Love the dinner set which is priced reasonably at $29.90++. Great quality and taste for the price!
4
Came here with friends and recommend having the duck confit. It was a nice evening dinner where we were able to chat and chill. Food was good but music was a little loud that we had to talk over it.
3
I've been to the SAVEUR PURVIS STREET before and enjoyed the quality dishes and nice service. But the service at the Cathay is quite disappointing. At first, when we were ordering a bottle of red wine, the waitress recommended us the 1 for 1 glass of wine, so we ordered 4 glasses of red and white wine. After serving 2 glasses of red and white wine, the same waitress came to apologized for that the promotion is no longer valid. Why didn't the waitress inform before serving? We were not able to change the order to a bottle of wine. After we finished the main courses, we kept looking at the waiters but none of them came to clean the table until my friend went to inform them that we were ready for desserts. One of the waiters even looked away when he noticed that we're looking at him.
3
I have bought chope vouchers for set meals and I have used chope vouchers for set meals at many other restaurants. However only Saveur made their own rules that it can be used for a la cart food only. Disappointed because this terms and conditions were not told or written
3
My fianc√©e and I dined here on Sunday, 18 September. We had made a reservation so we were seated immediately and staff were quick enough to take our order. My other half and I decided to each have the 3-course set dinner menu: she ordered the foie gras starter, beef tenderloin and chocolate and hazlenut dessert, while I had salmon for starters and mains and the dessert entitled "cookies & milk". Unfortunately, none of these courses had any further descriptions save the names of the dishes on the page (no ingredients lists or allergy/dietary warnings; see the image attached). We were also not informed that the dishes were listed separately on other parts of the menu, something which is not always done in restaurants (it is not unusual for dishes to be designed specially for set menus).In any case, it transpired that the dessert I had ordered contained peanuts to which I am allergic, though only mildly. My fianc√©e had asked the waiter regarding the desserts whether they contained peanuts and he stated that they did not, only hazelnuts. I was surprised, however, that he did not investigate our enquiry any further than this, such as check with the chef.I subsequently had an allergic reaction to my dessert, but was able to recover without medical attention. When we brought up the lack of warnings with staff, they were nonplussed by events and simply asked us to direct our feedback to their generic enquiries email address which we promptly did (we have as yet received no reply).Overall, the food (as pictured) was very good, but the lack of customer care, certainly where something as serious as food allergy is concerned, left something to be desired
4
The staff who welcomed us did not make us feel very welcome. She had this grumpy look and started rattling what they have and not have before we could sit down. But after that, we had great service from the staff, including the one who welcomed us. I guess we arrived at the wrong moment. :) We enjoyed the food (the portion was just nice for ladies), one-for-one wine and the duck salad. The restaurant was nice and cozy. We will definitely go back again
4
Had set dinner. The food tasted good. A little pricey but recommended for another visit.
You may or may not like their industrial interior. Open kitchen concept, so your clothes may get the food smell. Overall pleasant experience though
5
The quality of the food is spot on. If you're looking for a place to have nice food and drinks, saveur's the place you might want to place it on your check list.
4
The restaurant have 1 for 1 wine promotion. Me and my hubby enjoyed the food as well as the wine in this kind of relaxing atmosphere. Will come back again.
5
Had a lunch here last Sunday. Nice food and ambient. The price is affordable for French cuisine. Enjoy my lunch here.
4
Food was great but portion could have been slightly more. They charged for water but was not prompted in refilling it. My Friend and I were not full after the meal.
5
Visit saveur multiple times. Serve good food with reasonable price. Enjoy the food. Always recommend to frenz
4
The starter and main were acceptable good but the drinks & dessert are normal. Overall is value for money.
5
Im not sure if this was the same place as I had been before (they were serving lots of pasta before). Much to my demise, I couldn't get to have pasta again. The set meal was very filling but very pricey.
3
Been to Saveur at Cathay. It is no longer called Concetto? We were a party of 3 with 2 set menus and ala carte orders and made a reservation through chope. Staff wasn't too attentive but it was probably because we were sitting at a corner?My friend had the mushroom soup but we both felt that it didn't turn out as expected. Other than the taste of mushroom at the end, there wasn't much taste of mushrooms. The mash potatoes on the duck confit was so sticky. Duck leg looks flatten into the mash. My medium rare steak was done to medium but it was great. Only problem is we were probably not use to the cheese in the herb butter. I was glad I tried a little of it before putting it on my steak. It was difficult to swallow and I wouldn't have eaten my steak if I put any on it. Dessert was the best. The consistency of the molten caramel that flowed out from the lava cake. It was just nice and not too sweet. The pistachio panna cotta had the taste of nutty pistachios. The creme br√ªl√©e has berries on it. However the moisture on the berries ruin the crisp of the sugar coating on top of the creme br√ªl√©e. It would have been better if the berries were not on top. It looked pretty though. I order a bottle of red wine and it was suppose to be 1-for-1. I had to bring it up before they bought me second bottle. Thank you for placing it in a bag and letting me bring that home even though the staff mentioned that promo was only valid if I drank it there. It didn't make sense for me to take up table space for another 2 hours just to open and finish another bottle of wine between me and my friend.
2
- Were told to change table when we were having desert to give way to other customers, which is quite disruptive. As a result, me and my friend rush to finish up the desert and left the place.- Food taste was okay but the portion was rather small for a guy- The ambient isn't that great for dating, slightly cramp and lack of decoration
5
Food is always consistently great, it never fails to delight my friends and guests alike. Tasty, affordable and reliable, what more can I ask for?
4
It was not bad for a casual French cuisine restaurant and quite good value, especially when there is promo. Especially like the salmon confit - A Must-Try!
5
Saveur has upped their game from their early days in a coffee shop. Now it's good food and not just good value.
3
Quality of food is good, but knowing that it's part of the Saveur group, we had expectations of better initiative from service staff, who obviously were either very inexperienced or part-timers. Otherwise, it was a rather delightful dinner (in spite of the squishy table arrangements).
2
Waited for food for quite long, the duck starter for the 3 set course is not nice. The kitchen is too loud.
4
The food is without a question, great. Portion is also generous. But my wishlist will be that recommendations and slight enthusiasm will be great.
1
I was really hesitating to write this review. However, it is still kind of disturbing for me to recall this bad experience I had in Saveur Cathay. I was with my family that day and have made a restaurant reservation via Chope app. Upon arrival, we are served by this Philippino staff (looks like the restaurant supervisor, who is at the same time attending to the cashier). Initially, she served us with a smile and took our food and drink orders. We ordered only plain water (fyi, plain water costs 30 cents each). We have ordered 4 glasses of warm water and 1 glass of cold water. She repeated our orders as clear as crystal. However, moments later, she turned up to our table with the wrong order (it becomes 4 glasses of cold water and 1 glass of warm water). Instead of apologising for serving us the wrong order, she blamed me and insisted I was the one giving her the orders. I was so angry and pissed and at the same time, she did the roll-eye expression and she did not even apologise at all. Moreover, she just left the water and walked away.What kind of attitude is this, I was thinking. I tried to move on yet our food orders turned out to be wrong too. It was a total mixed up and luckily my hubby took the initiative and went up to clarify all our orders again with her. Imagine this??!?! What service is this when I am actually paying for the service charge?I cannot believe this... At the end of our dinner, when I was making the payment, she did not even bother to communicate to us and just handed us the total amount (where I have to manually offset the chope voucher myself with the bill) and just asked me "CASH OR CREDIT". Seriously, is this the way how Saveur survived through these years? Correct me if I am wrong... I did not remember Saveur to be like this, I had my many lunchs and dinners in Saveur (Bugis Purvis Street) and it was really one of my top most choices. Now.. after this bad experience, plus with my family members there, I will not go and visit anymore EVEN the food was good.I will also advise my friends to think twice about visiting Saveur.. I rate this establishment with a 3'D's.. Disappointed, Dismay, Discomfort & Definitely Disgusted
4
1 side is slightly crisp, the other side just nice 100% cooked, no crisp at al. feels like the chef forgot abt that side. not as nice as it usually was. beef tenderloin was wonderful but the sides werent to my liking. but worth it for dinner set. the sea bass was even better i feel. the potatoes were great. however they dont give discount when i use voucher from chope when they said can, the last time i went. oh well. servers are more attentive compared to elsewhere......
3
Come here for quick lunch and order their set lunch. Their signature pasta quite nice, main course that i order is chicken roulade with risoto (ok not bad). Dessert is the winner for me that is pistachio pannacota. Quite sweet but but nice or maybe because i like peanut.The ambience rather ok. As the service considered not bad
1
Dont waste ur time and money go somewhere else. Service staff is snobbish, food is worst. Totally do not worth the amount been charge. Staff took super long to serve us and we have to keep chasing after our orders. Overall we spend and average of $50 pp and it is just horrible
3
Had the angus beef Father's Day set. Beef was not cooked to right doneness (med well) and had to be sent back, came back still too bloody.
4
food is nice and price is really cheap, butthe tables are so tiny, only can barely seat for two people‚Ä¶
1
Service was slow. Waiter forgot the order. Waiters were looking down on the floor half of the time and not attentive. They even missed my special request for a cake for my mother for her birthday.
5
Had a birthday celebration there and all was good. We could keep our cake there as well for quite a few hours ahead of our dining time. Service crew was courteous and food was good! Duck confit and truffle mash is the best
4
Reservation was fast to confirm & everything was good. However, not quite sure why the restaurant that day had a very strong oily or fried smell that lingers on your clothing. Normally it wasn't like this.
5
The food exceeded my expectations, could tell that much thought was put into cooking the food. Loved the Salmon Confit especially and the cookies and milk.
4
Ordered : foie gras with lentils, salmon confit, baked chicken, salmon, beef, chocolate &hazelnutFoie gras: creamy,melt in your mouth goodness, paired perfectly with lentil to bring down the oilyness. Salmon: 2.5 out of 5 stars. Barley risotto is sour and uncomfortabke, salmon skin is excessively salty. Only good part is the soft,moist pinkish salmonC&H: heaven on first 5 bites.Jalat after. Crunchy bits gives texture to this art piece dessert and the raspberries help to lessen the jalat feel. Pure sinful .yum
3
the foie gras was not as crispy as it was supposed to be. duck confit was nice as usual. the beef tenderloin was superb. aft the meal i felt cheated tho as i wanted to choose my preferred seats but they said other seats were reserved, yet i also did make a reservation but was given some random seats. ironic isnt it. causes the experience to dim a little. not that i was being fussy on that day

We love the yummy food and it's presentation. We love their desserts too. The ambience is a bit cold, lighting too dark, we visited them on a rainy day for lunch. Too dark to even take picture nicely. Maybe lighting not enough, need to call the staff a few times to get their attention. The staff are otherwise friendly and nice. We love their food but it will be a plus point if they could improve on hospitality. For customers visiting them on their birthday, it will be really nice if they could even give a slice of cake or a special drink on the house. Well, I'm just suggesting. Maybe at night the place will be more romantic with it's dark setting. My visit at Saveur on evening is more pleasant.I will visit again and look forward to an improve ambience

Party of 7 for Mothers' Day Lunch. They have a discount for the 2 mothers in the dining party which was a more meaningful gesture than the typical overpriced special occasion menus. Saveur stuck to their tried & true set lunch menu. The dried baby shrimp & noodle appetizer is noteworthy as is their entr√É¬©e duck confit. All the other options were no less delicious. They're affordable and unpretentious. On the repeat list.
4
The food was not the best, but slightly above average. Duck confit's a must try! Truffle mash was really tasty.
The customer service makes up for the moderate food though, keep it up!
4
We had the 3 course set dinner. We were pleased with the quality of food served and at an affordable price for french cusine.
4
Food was good for the price. Service was great and the overall environment was really nice to chill :-)
1
Meal was served wrongly. Duck confit was hard. Seabass tasteless. Full house on a Friday night yet they were severely understaffed. Wasn't as cheap as I heard it would be. It was almost $70 for 2 pax.
5
Great food. Fast service.Except the dessert has rum marinated grapes and need to highlight esp got kids ordering .
4
It's quite vacant on weekend, very nice for brunch with fam. Have been there a couple times now, always go for duck confit.
4
foie gras was of top standard this time. the pasta was a little plain w little tiger prawns in mini cubes. the oven baked chicken was freshly baked and the truffle mash go along w it perfectly as usual.
5
It was really crowded. Luckily I could reserve through Chope! Food was delicious surpassing my expectations! The deco was kept to a minimum which is a good idea to keep costs low!
4
go there with an open mind, portion isn't big so don't go there with a hungry tummy and expect it to be filled.. French cuisines are known for small portions. Overall we had a wonderful meal and great location before catching our movie @ The Catha
5
recommended. food is awesome and price is value! will go back again. space is small, service is quick, menu is clear. should have some photos of food for easy selection. I have to google or search on ig for food photo to know what i'm having.
4
Went there on a busy Saturday evening. They seem to be running on minimal manpower. However the staff were polite and efficient. The quality of the food was great. It wasn't compromised at all.
4
Always a fan of the saveur pasta and duck confit. Waiting time was acceptable and service was generally good.
3
Slow serving, had to wait for awhile for the food to be served. Food was consistently good among other outlets. Its just the waiting time and that the ventilation wasnt working very well
3
Disorganized. Appetisers came after the main courses. Had a better experience at the Purvis Street branch
5
It is a place where good food are made affordable for people. The service is also good with the venue being accessible from dhoby ghaut mrt station.
4
Visited this restaurant with the GF over the Labor Day weekend. We were quite satisfied that the place was peaceful and allowed us to enjoy a lovely conversation over dinner. We ordered Saveur's Pasta for starters to share, and Chicken Roulade and Pork Belly for mains. The food was as expected: simple, affordable and definitely value for its price. Overall, we would recommend for anyone looking for a simple and unpretentious meal with their SOs
3
Affordable French Cuisine at Cathay. We made reservation on line and was seated directly. Restaurant was crowded and seems not enough servers. Food are good. Try the variety of appetizer like salad, Foei Gras with apple and escargot, well prepared. We also tried the pistachio for dessert. Perfect choice. Can improve the service
4
Food selection was not wide. However, the prices were very affordable considering how they are situated in town. Ambiance was less than satisfactory because of the noise and crowd. However, the duck confit was a winner. The foie gras was, however, disappointing. So is the Seafood Bisque. Garden Salad and Escargots were average. The Saveur Pasta (appetizer) was delicious!
4
My favourite food there is saveur pasta for my appetizer, then duck confit is for my main course. Unfortunately, the service is terrible, the hostess or staff didnt assist me or tell me where is my table, then the staff there is not friendly( they show attitude)
4
Last week we were celebrating my friend's birthday at Saveur and we had a great time there. The foods are delicious with reasonable price. I requested to put some wording on the dessert in order to give a surprise to my friend. The staff helped me to do so and, on top of that, they lighted up a candle for us as well. Really appreciate that. We will definitely revisit the restaurant again. Thank you
4
Nice food, prompt service, comfortable ambience. Abit pricey but of coz not expensive compared to other French cuisine.
4
Service was alright, nothing to complain about. The food was great for the price. Would definitely come back again. :)
3
i loved the relaxed atmosphere, the food was good, but each portion-size was different from person to person. service staff were attentive and polite, definitely a plus point.
2
My friends and I ordered the 3 course dinner set. After the starter, we waited at least 40mins before our mains came. The dessert took 20mins after main course. We were just glad that we weren't rushing for a movie. Wouldn't recommend this place to anyone who isn't prepared to wait
3
The price is attractive but the portion is very small. Good place for gathering with friends and try out French food. Tried the Saveur pasta, duck confit, pork belly, and lava cake with ice cream which costs as much as our pork belly main course :) The duck is so so, but I like that it was not salty like some other French restaurants. The pork belly reminded us as Japanese ramen dish, and tasted similar too! But disappointed at the presentation, in a bowl, with gravy, like ramen without the noodles :)
3
You don't get the welcome greetings nor look as you step in. We were there for snack but no sandwiches except mini mushroom soup and mini small pasta which both taste good. Soup served in a tea cup size. See my photo. But ice lemon tea was served super sour and I had to request for a change. Waitress said they made a mistake of 3 parts lemon and 1 part sugar instead. Oh well, if you are just passing by and it's not crowded. Hop in. But won't make a trip deliberately just to eat there
3
Service was very average. My plate was not cleared after we were done with the meal. For a good 20min. Staff were walking right past us and never once asked to take our plates away. Had to ask for them to clear it and bring out the dessert. The salted caramel lava cake is honestly one of the worst desserts I've ever had... The "cake" had a rubbery texture and the entire filling was salted caramel so the sweetness was just overwhelming. The duck confit was the only saving grace and that's the only reason why I'd ever consider going back...Disappointing experience. Been here twice before and this was the worst experience.
3
We were disappointed to be told that there wasn't any coffee left at 12.30pm on a week day. I was treating my friend to a farewell lunch and she had wanted a flat white but the server said (very nicely though) that they had run out of coffee, which is a little weird since it was only start of service. The irony: I much preferred the menu at Concetto before they became Saveur
3
There was a party of 8 and it was our first visit.the food is average priced but in small portions.a few of us did not have enough from our own main entree.There was limited selection of beverages and desserts.This would be an alternative venue instead of a choice
3
The food was excellent. Kudos to the chefs. Unfortunately the service staff could do with more training. Water not refilled, orders had to be repeated, 2 table settings for 3 pax. I lost count of the number of times my hand was raised to get their attention. Staff seemed more keen to interact amongst themselves than with customers. I'd only consider coming back to this outlet for the food
3
The shop is big but looks so empty. The atmosphere not good compare to another outlet at Far East that I always visit.
4
Will revisit & recommend. Food is good. Pricing average. Saveur Pasta a must to try. Except no coffee...
5
Brilliant main course. Do try their Salted Caramel Chocolate Lava cake. In all a complete value for money. Portions are small, very French indeed.
5
It is value for food. The service is good. I enjoyed my dinner there. Sad thing is dinner 3 course menu doesn't include duck confit for mains otherwise would have ordered the course menu dinner
2
i need to wait the menu for 5 min after seated. no one notice that we cannot order because the absent of menu.
we need to wait another 15min for our pre-ordered dessert after we completed our main course.
3
The Saveur pasta was lacking in flavour, this was a tad disappointing as i remembered it as being very tasteful.
3
Overall experience was good. Service was prompt and reservation was easily retrieved. However, menu was unclear of which dishes were not available.
There was no option of tap water and iced/warm water was chargeable at 30 cents per glass.
4
Went for their Valentine's set menu and it was very good. Portions were just right and generous considering the price.Only upsetting bit was actually nothing on the restaurant's part, we were sat next to a very unpleasant group who were being very difficult customers with a whole slew of 'custom orders' that kept changing. But kudos to the staff for handling them with poise and patience! (
4
First time at Saveur and I am loving it. The food served are of good quality and affordable. The 3 course meal is a good deal but only if your stomach have space for that. Do book early via Chope so you will avoid to queue.
2
Aside from the cozy ambience, food choices were very limited and poor in quality (food was cold for me). Place was also slightly filthy with ants crawling up my arms every once in a while and a dragonfly which came to visit whilst waiting for my meal to arrive
5
Good ambience and also food is affordable and delicious! Must try their duck confit. There's a promotion going on, order 2 mains to get a free appetizer pasta which is totally worth it!
5
Great food, great service. Very cheap and tastes nice. Food took a little long to come but there was full house on that day.
4
My wife hv our weekly dates n it's up 2 me 2 find new n wonderful places to eat. I'm not a lover of duck but i tried. But we'll from a non lover i really loved it. Really good food
3
Had high expectation for the duck confit but when I tried it, it didn't really "wow" me. Slightly understaffed but can be corrected easily.
4
Food was great, staff are attentive and fast to recommend similar food when the ones we ordered were not available. The restaurant wasn't too noisy, conducive for small gatherings with friends. Will be better if there are more choices for dessert.
3
Ambient is good. Food is a 4, but service isn't initiative enough and orders were forgotten. Could be improved on that.
3
Went to Saveur for its Valentine's Day set meal, we were seated promptly. The place was not too noisy as compared to the branch at Far East.We waited more than 30 mins for the appetizer to be served. I'm not sure if the waitress left us out or was too busy to keep track of our courses. She came to us and asked if our appetizers were served. Shouldn't they take note of customers' orders?Next, I bought a cake and left it under their care to be temporarily stored in their fridge. To my greatest surprise, my cake was served to the guests seated on our left side! I had to highlight to her that the cake belonged to me. She swiftly wanted to serve us the cake while we were still waiting for our main course to arrive and that spoilt the surprise I had for my fiance.Next, we were served ice water that was ordered by the guest seated on the left! Once again, I had to highlight that the order belonged to the next table. Are customers expected to help remember orders for the waitresses?Although I was disappointed in the service, I must say that the food were freshly prepared. I enjoyed the food there but would seriously think twice about returning. Hopefully the management can look into staff training
3
We sat at a corner table that night and food came without a long wait but the ice water we asked for never came even after we finished the meal. And no service staff was around to help us! We were quite disappointed with the service
4
This is my first visit to Concetto although have been to Saveur several times already. The festive set meal is quite limited but we have option to order from a-la-carte menu too. This might not be possible during Christmas period in other restaurant. Overall the food is very delicious and will definitely visit again
3
First and foremost, keeping the name "Saveur" does invoke certain perception on the quality of location, environment, service and food.I have not been to Saveur, but being one who usually researches and looks at reviews prior, I have been forewarned to lower my expectations and not compare it to Saveur.We were meeting a long time friend there for lunch, and reaching just before they opened. Spartan greyish plain environment setting, creating a feel of 80s canteen style, though this results in the chairs making too much high pitch sounds when it is movedService to the table was "spartan" - maybe just waking up to the start of the day. Not much of a smile.Taking the set lunch, overall I would say the food is average to quite good, though it is dependent on what is ordered and your taste for the food - likely the reason for reviews that stretches from very good, satisfying, to bad, rubbish etc.With my lowered expectations, I would say overall is average, with definitely room for improvement, especially in terms of service, food quality, and presentation. Perhaps a 2nd visit will likely result in a more realistic review. At this point, I would just say it is somewhere you can go to if in need
3
Decent value and food, good location. Nice place for a chat.
Not much else to say, certainly not 40 characters.
4
Went to have a nice dinner but there is no seat available at the moment. Reserve a table and within 10 mins received a sms notification that a table is ready. Food is nice and quite affordable. Will be back again soon
1
The most terrible mushroom soup I ever had. It was worse than the can. It was like water. The standards dropped drastically.
2
I think there are only few restaurants in the world which I gave this title, but actually it reflects the true concept. Someone doing canteen food and sell it for restaurant pricing. Will not recommend or re-visit this place again ever.
3
Didn't have a good first experience here. So was a bit apprehensive when I was invited to a private lunch event here. My apprehension was unfounded as it was a good lunch. Food was tasty & service was good. Will probably try it a third time. Hopefully it will be even better
4
I had make a reservation prior to dinner since is a Friday evening. The restaurant has a cool and young feel. I love the food and the portion is just nice for a small eater like me. I ordered the MUST TRY dish on the menu "Duck Panzerotti" ($14.90). The duck meat was wrap in moon shape pasta that looks like dumpling. On top of the pasta, was some sweet potato crisp. I love the salty taste dumpling but the sweet potato crisp was a bit too hard. My friend ordered the Crab Risotto ($12.90). I normally don't like t eat risotto but this was certainly good. The texture was just nice, not too creamy and very yummy. I would come back and try others dishes another day. But the service staffs was not very attentive
4
Went there for a Sunday brunch with friends. I find that the menu price is very affordable but what surprises me more is that the palate leans towards French-Italian fine dining style. Service was average but that's because it was very busy. I would certainly come back again to try more from its menu
3
Not bad a place if you are after petite portions at the prices offered at a no frills place for a variety of gourmet food. Service is quick and polite. You can see the action in the open kitchen. Water is served at 30 cents. The 4 minced pork ravioli portion is yummy. Crab risotto was bland. Not a place to hang around after your meal if you want to have a quiet cosy chat.
4
Started by young chefs a few years out of culinary school, you can feel the energy of the place. The last time I was here, I had the beef which was good. This time, I tried the pork cheek with gnocchi, which is also good. Portions are not big but prices are reasonable. Worth going back again
3
They do dish up decent food for the price, especially in terms of presentation. The usual trade-off for the philosophy of good food at low prices is either quantity or quality. Concetto does well by its portions; however the quality is a little lacking for me.I tried the Grilled Octopus Caesar Salad, Buffalo Mozzarella, Beef Oyster Blade, and Red Snapper. The Red Snapper was amazing; everything else were subpar. I'm not expecting the world for their prices, but I do expect to have what I read on the menu. Concetto uses big words in their menu to mimic fine dining, but fail to deliver in the quality of their food.Good food does not need fancy ingredients. And with their Red Snapper I had a wonderful dish that used simple, fresh ingredients, combined with good cooking techniques. Stop playing with fancy names and instead use their culinary expertise to deliver delicious fine dining worthy food. I think that would make them really shine.For photos and the full review, head over here: http://www.chocolat-et-basil.com/#!Concetto-by-Saveur/cmbz/F8F7B713-8333-4F47-A217-DF8074A2645

I have been to this place 2nd time around and I may say the food is delicious plate by plate it comes to beautifully presented and equally good tasting.affordable treat!
1
The kitchen staff started taking off their aprons, which triggered us to follow up on our mains. We then saw them put on their aprons again and started cooking! When we asked the waiter if they had forgotten about our order and what turned us off is that he blatantly lied that the kitchen staff was very busy. Ya right. The food was a complete disappointment - the aglio tasted was soaked in oil and tasted salty, like everyone other dish that we ordered. The duck confit looked like a piece of overnight duck thrown into the microwave. This restaurant is a complete disaster and I totally regretted my visit into this nightmare restaurant wannabe. A far cry from Saveur, and a total disgrace.
1
Went to Concetto by Saveur thinking the standard is as good as its sister restaurant in Purvis street but I was totally WRONG! I had the seafood soup which was the only dish I think is quite good. For starter I had the saveur's signature pasta but compared to the restaurant at Purvis street this one was totally dry and tasteless! Next the Kurobuta pork cheek for my main course had this intense "pork smell" and it was so strong that I couldn't bring myself to finish it. The duck confit which was ordered by my friend was also mediocre. The service was also below average I sat there for 15 mins waiting for friends to come and yet no service staff bother to ask if I needed a drink! Overall food and service suck
3
I headed to Concetto for dinner on a weekday night. Although I didn't have a reservation, a group of 2 can be seated pretty quickly. I tried the Tuna salad and the Duck Tortellini. This is my second time at Concetto but I still think that the food is only so-so and nothing to shout about. I think they're better with French food
4
Good location for great food at very affordable prices. Don't judge it by the exterior.I had the spring chicken dish with cognac cream sauce which was wonderful. It is amazingly easy to screw up chicken but my dish was succulent and tasty. Also paired it with a glass of acceptable white wine for $6 which was quite value for money. The food also came SWIFTLY which was a plus point!Seating was a little tight but was not too bad. Overall a good place for dinner! Would return when in tow
4
Stumbled on this place for lunch on Saturday noon. Pleasant environment, food wise, most dishes were great. I had the squid ink risotto which was really good. The squid salad also very good. WIll give the prawn fettucine a miss next time as it turned out to be too similar to a local dish called "mee pok". Prices were reasonable and there's a promo for drinks when you get a main dish. Service was just ok. Will go there again only because the food is good
4
I've come to Concetto twice for their mushroom risotto and have yet to find a risotto elsewhere that's to my liking as much as this place. At other restaurants, risotto if not done well can turn out soggy and bland but Concetto's version is perfectly al dente (is that the right term?) and wonderfully flavorful. Portions are not full-on American sized but I find that this way it leaves room to enjoy a starter and/or dessert. The deconstructed tiramisu is pretty awesome as well - although it did take us a few moments to adjust to the idea of not having a bowl or glass.Concetto is very popular, so it would be better if you made your reservation ahead of time so that you don't have to wait. Again, due to the popularity, you will feel rather 'hounded' - not by the waitstaff who are lovely and understanding, but by the many pairs of watching eyes of those waiting to be seated
3
We happened to pass by and decided to pop in. Perhaps they were trying for a zen like place, with concrete benches and minimalist decor. The crowd was mostly in their 20s.Foodwise, we liked what we ordered. We started with the grilled octopus, with fennel leaves and lemon aioli. It was fresh and light. We also had the prawn aglio and the duck tortellini. The prawn pasta was good, with the right amount of spiciness and was not too oily. The tortellini was nice and not too firm, though I did think that some of the duck tasted a little strong and gamey. Overall, the dish was good.Portions are smallish, but prices were also reasonable. Service was friendly and quick.They also have a French bistro over at Far East, so do try that out too
5
It looks good, smells lovely and tastes heavenly! We popped in for lunch on a whim, when we had originally set out for ramen. However the tailback for the carpark at Bugis+ was atrocious so we zipped over to the Cathay instead.What a treat! The tuna pan seared was fabulous with its salad and sauces, as was the grilled octopus and bed of shredded fennel.The piece de resistance was without doubt the Wagyu Tender; done medium rare it melts in your mouth accompanied by the dulcit tones of the foie gras. The other main we had was the beef oyster blade. Very tender and beautifully seasoned and plated, it was of a standard that wouldn't be out of place in any of the other fine dining French establishments in town.Treat yourself, it's amazing!
3
The menu is short and sweet.. there's a page of Pasta information, which is nice.. but what I don't understand why there is a choice of fresh and box pasta? Shouldn't you use fresh pasta all the time? if you're using box pasta, I think all of us can also make our own pasta dish at home. The dishes we ordered were bolognese and prawn aglio olio, both with fresh pasta. The bolognese was okay, I have had better, but the prawn aglio olio was delicious! I think it's an okay place if you're craving for some decent pasta.As for service, there's this one waitress who didn't smile at all.. There rest of them were quite friendly.. I would come back again to try other food there.
