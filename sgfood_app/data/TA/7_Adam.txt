overpriced, poor service, average food. there isn't much more to say about it to fill in 100 characters.

wagyu rumb steak and tom yum lamb shank were ordered. personally do not like tom yum lamb shank. but the wagyu rumb steak was cooked in a nice way. But these does not delight me with the high ranking in tripadvisor.

Came with a large group of friends. The food was good, but certainly nit exceptional. It's expensive, in particular the wine, but so is everywhere in Singapore. Contemporary western food, nice surroundings, but the bill took the edge off the evening

Another great restaurant in the city and right on the wharf and one of the best locations you can find to eat good food. The service is impeccable and the staff are very responsive to all your needs. It has upstairs, downstairs and outdoor seating and which is great on one of the lovely singapore days with friends and family. The entrees are really great and you will find a variety of them that are really good, for example; crab, the prawns, tandoori kingfish, and you can get a mixed platter of seafood or vegetarian too and try all in one go. i Would recommend this restaurant to all for the food, service and the location too

We had a family dinner for 6 at 7 Adam last evening, the meal was very good, I had the carrot and ginger soup to start and Pork fillet for main, others in our group had the beetroot salad and scallops for starters and Salmon and Lamb for mains, all were very nicely presented. Adam 7 is in an old Black and White and has great ambiance. On a previous visit we seated outside and treated to a very good acoustic covers band which made a great evening. Sadly one of the waiters advised us that Adam 7 was closing at the end of this month due to the landlord not extending the lease

I was keen to check this place out given the rave reviews on TripAdvisor. I feel compelled to write a rather lukewarm review to contrast the positive remarks here. The food was good but the service was terrible. Perhaps the worst I've experienced in Singapore. It took forever to get someone to serve us, our plates went uncleared and we had to top up our own wine glasses. Simply unacceptable considering the prices they charge.This may have been due to the fact they were hosting a private party and were understaffed. Clearly they don't have the capacity to cater for both dining guests and a private function. The menu was creative and the food was good, except for the tiramisu which was pretty average. Try the masala cod or the tom yum lamb shank. The place is interesting and different with the art on display but honestly, none of the art was to my taste and the lighting was too bright to create a nice atmosphere. I would like to assume that we just caught the service staff on a bad night, so would consider coming back

Who knew that dining here would be kinda fun! Apart from chatting with my friends while waiting for our dishes to arrive, we had a fun distraction admiring at the artworks on display that are artistically infused in with the decor of the restaurant.To top off the experience, the service of the staff was fantastic! Good food and inspirational sights with great service makes it a wholesome experience dining in here.Repeat visitations to this restaurant will be a Must for me and friends

Amazing Food and Experience... I was craving red meat, so when I received my meal, it was practically melting in my mouth and of course I had to pair it with a glass of red wine, I asked my server what they would suggest as a good pair and they were right it was superb... I'm from NYC so I'm pretty hard to please but when I went to 7adam I was feeling right at home... I know this is kind of petty but seriously the decor of this place is so cool! with all the art everywhere and the outside patio with live music. I loved my experience here
5
Definitely deserve a come back. Amongst the many thing I had, my main favourite was the Unagi Pasta. That is a must try! This place is definitely a good place for friends to catch up and get together. If you are a fan of live band, pop by this place on Saturday and be seated outdoors to enjoy it. Oh another reason, to come the chocolate fondant cake! Its freshly baked - fifteen minutes of waiting, its really worth it
5
Away from the bustling city, this restaurant is an excellent venue for a classy date. The lush greenery surrounding the restaurant, coupled with the display of fine art within the building creates a stimulating environment for the senses which i enjoyed thoroughly. Whilst i indugled in the visual display of beauty all around me, my tastebuds were treated to tantalising desserts brought to us by the lovely staff of 7Adam restaurant.Truly an all-rounded experience to excite the senses
5
Good location, great ambience, perfect place for events or gathering with friends! Food is good as well, worth a try! :)

Loved the venue and the Singapore food week deal.
Will be looking to go back at some other stage for the ala carte menu.
The Outdoor area was quite nice as was the ambiance

7 Adam was recommended by a friend. It was indeed a pleasurable dining experience for me and my friends. Very nice ambience. Overall, food was good. Excellent service crew was a plus point. They were attentive, accomodative and very helpful.

Overall dining experience in 7 Adam was great! Location: The restaurant is situated at the hilltop of Adam Park in a colonial bungalow. quiet and very private Restaurant: ... food is delicious and affordable..outdoor chill on deck kool..live band is lively ...
5
First and foremost, I love the ambiance and the whole layout of the restaurant. Went with a group of friends, and we got the outdoors seating. There are parking lots available! Moving forward, I would strongly recommend their Unagi pasta. Damnnnnn good! I am still thinking about it as I am typing this. I am actually not a fan of Foie Gras but hell, you gotta try their Foie Gras salad too! It may be a small portion to you but it is a starter right. Moving on.... we also had their Seafood Aglio Oglio, Thai Infused salad, Fish & Chips and Crispy Truffled Fries. There were 4 of us, so we had a bit of everything. NO REGRETS. For desserts, we got the Chocolate Fondant (freshly baked!) and honeycake (which is something different, dare you to try it!). Overall, we are satisfied! Excellence food, service and ambiance! Wouldn't mind recommending this place to my family and friends. Nice place to dine and hang out too! :

We had selections from the Brunch menu - the eggs Benedict with tempura portobello mushroom and the wagyu beef sliders ..... Both were excellent . The sliders could have been accompanied by some fries . Nice atmosphere in an old colonial black & White House ; Not handicap friendly

We came here during restaurant week and it was a nice lunch. A lovely atmosphere (it's in a big black and white backing onto trees and gardens) and if you live in Arcadia Road or Bukit Timah, it's easy to get to and a nice alternative the usual Greenwood Plaza restaurants.The food was good, but not great. The main (chicken) was a little on the oily side, the starter was little more than a couple of lettuce leaves. but the dessert was great. The service was attentive and friendly and the restaurant itself is lovely, though it did take a while to get seated (about 15 mins despite having a reservation).I wouldn't rush to come back, but it's a nice local restaurant to have around. Our server mentioned that they have live music and 1 for 1 cocktails on the terrace (which is lovely and away from the road) on Saturdays, which I think we'd be more inclined to try than another lunch
5
Had visited the place sometime last year during the restaurant week, glad I came back more smiles from the friendly staff and the manager Mr Isham he made us feel like home. The food was great I love the spicy spag it's something I love and there are level of spicy ness for the seafood spag. The live band that plays on Saturday night were great. If you want to dine and relax Saturdays are the days to come. This is a place I would recommend to my friends. Thank you 7 adam and staff I will come backShaw

A friend of mine and I had a wonderful time dining at this restaurant during the Restaurant week. The ambience was fantastic - the restaurant was carefully curated with numerous art pieces which made our dining experience rather unique.The Restaurant week's menu didn't do the ambience justice though - the flavour was either too bland or too empowering to my liking (although we may need to take into account that the chefs might be overwhelmed by the numbers of orders they needed to dished out within a short window period that might compromise on the taste of the food). The saving grace was the complimentary chocolate lava cake the waiter, Padi, served us on the house. Probably need to taste their full menu before passing on any conclusive verdict on the taste and quality of the food.The hospitality of the waiters/waitresses was excellent. We would like to commend Padi and Sidik for being so attentive and patient in ensuring memorable dining experience to the both of us
4
The place and the setting is nice in an old black and white (colonial) house, which also is an art gallery! However, as we were there for restaurant week (a fine dining kind of restaurant promotion week, where the prices are reasonable for the relatively exclusive /high end restaurants in Singapore), the set menu was Ok but nothing special or to rave about. We had a look at the a la carte menu and there are some nice dishes there, so might be worthwhile to go back another time to check it out! If you like art and you like to dine in a different setting than the usual places, like in hotels, touristic places (like Boat Q, Clarque Q etc ), it is definitely something you need to check out

Great food, distinctive atmosphere and a very friendly manager
I tried the tom yum lamb shrank and it was fantastic. Definitely gonna recommend to friends and family
5
We had a lovely dining experience along with my girlfriends and I. We really loved the food as the standard of the food is always there. We had a pasta with Unagi, Nagano Pork Rack was simply tasty yet juicy. I would just say in simple term, done to perfection. We really enjoyed the company of the Restaurant Manager ( Isham ), which made us feel really at home with his jovial and yet concerning approach on what we should have and wines to go along with it. Really a beautiful evening with my friends. Will definitely return for more

This is the 3rd time here and still happy to share that each of my visits were excellent. First was in December for my birthday celebration, second in January with family and just this week with the girls. This visit review is the "freshess" Food is great as always - fortunate to have tried quite a few of the food on the menu. The privilege of dining with family and friends!!! Means more to taste!Starters were good; my personal favorite is the 'Goma' Wagyu Beef Carpaccio, which we tried this week. Being in Singapore we also like to have dishes to share and this time round we had the Truffle Sweet Potato Fries - BEST! Thought it was a generous serving and it came in a nice serving plate and was just the right temperature to sink your teeth into. I also enjoy their bread rolls, served nice and warm with butter. Mains; Masala Atlantic Cod Fish, done beautifully, right texture of the fish, beans were just right and rice was fragrant!Unagi Pasta, one would think unagi, have it Japanese style, but the chef has manage to make the seafood balance with the pasta just right! The Tom Yum Lamb Shank also a favorite! The meat is so tender, it comes off clean from the bone, it sits on a nice bed of mash potatoes. Delicious! I like.Their Apple Calvados I enjoyed too, if you are not one for chocolate desserts, this is something to try. The presentation was lovely and you know there was time taken to prepare it. Pricing is very reasonable for the quality of food served. And I'm happy to share that the restaurant manager service staff were attentive at each of my visits. I was welcomed warmly each time. Set up of the restaurant is lovely, as you have a choice of indoor or outdoor seating; suitable for both groups and lunch/dinner dates. The pieces of art work add an a different dining experience. We were very drawn to some of the pieces. Place is great for couples, family, friends and I think to talks business. Everyone can sit and enjoy a meal together. Thanks to the team at 7Adam

Finally decided to try this place with some friends who lived in the area. We were thrilled at our little "discovery".The restaurant is housed in a quaint black and white colonial house complete with a gallery on the first floor and a charming little outdoor area for drinks upstairs next to the dining/bar area.Another plus point is the free parking. :)Our servers were very friendly and the maitre d was very knowledgeable and gave us good advice on what to order and even suggested a lemon ginger tea for our friend who wasn't feeling well.Since it was our first time there we decided to try a bit of everything. We ordered the cod fish with buttered rice, grilled mackerel with potatoe gratin, breaded seabass with new potatoes and capsicum, wagyu beef steak with mash. All the mains went down very well except maybe my friend's beef was a bit too rare for her. However the star of the evening were the appetisers, we had the goma fried chicken and truffle and bean sprout risotto which were really tasty. We actually ordered seconds!All in all a wonderful night with good food and great wine. I would definitely recommend this place for a night out with friends for dining and/or drinking
5
I just wanna say that the staff in 7adams were really awesome the service that they gave me and my date was really great. Anyway, the food was perfect even though it was expensive but it was really really worth it. I'm surely gonna come back for more Rum Steak. Excellent job

OK, so I'm actually not usually one to complain or leave a restaurant however 7 Adam managed to get me to do this without even serving food! I had been looking forward to eating at this place after having read the good reviews, however things didn't start promisingly when we turned up at 7pm on a Saturday, with an empty restaurant only to be greeted by staff standing around and chatting showing no interest in customers whatsoever.After them finally deciding which one would come over and see us we were shown to a table that clearly wasn't clean, so moved to another. Things started getting worse from there. When we did finally get our menus, after having to ask for them, mine was crawling with ants - not good. The wine list took another 10 minutes to arrive, however we decided to go for a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc, hoping that the poor start was now behind us. Unfortunately not. After waiting another 15 minutes for someone to reappear and take our order - and bearing in mind we had now been in an empty restaurant for 30 minutes - we politely reminded them that we were still waiting for the wine, only to be told "sorry, we don't have any of that kind - are you ok with the red instead?" Sauvignon Blanc - white wine, so why would I be "ok with the red instead"? At that point we decided to leave rather than risk any further calamities. The staff were totally disinterested in us leaving, and frankly don't do the restaurant any favours at all. The food they serve may be good - but I will never find out, as terrible wait staff acting very unprofessionally will ensure that 7 Adam don't get my business, or any recommendations from me to friends - apart from "stay away" that is.

Beautiful art pieces displayed for viewing while dinning in.Very comforting atmosphere. Friendliest staffs I still remembered: Hisham, Haziq, Sharon, Sidek n amazing chefs. Food and beverages is amazing n affordable.Only tiny negative comment is waiting time for food but of course duely to the amount of people dinning in. 7ADAM'S SummerBlue Drink, Seafood Aglio Olio and Chocolate Fondane is one of the must try!yours sincerely,Ashraf

Brought my family here for a birthday celebration with high expectations based on the superlative reviews on TA. The reality was otherwise, right from the time the online reservation was made. Up to the next evening, i had not received a call from the restaurant regarding my booking as indicated, and I had to call them for confirmation. On the phone, they were very nice, and spontaneously offered a complimentary fondant cake when they found out the occasion.Perhaps because it was unusually busy for a Sunday, the 2 servers were worked off their feet, and so service was cursory at best. The food took some time to come, including our bottle of wine which was produced only after I asked for it, and that only after our starters had come.The food was okay at best, the only standout dish being the unagi pasta topped with an omelette swimming in some sauce. The soup portions were miniscule. I have tasted far better mushroom soup elsewhere and the butternut soup with ginger and crab which sounded great on paper turned out to be an odd combination. The hokkaido scallops were decent but small, and again not outstanding. The biggest letdown was the fish. I ordered the masala cod, much against my better judgement and it turned out to be nondescript, so too the turmeric grilled barramundi, although they do their beans well. My family members who had the beef cheek linguine and seafood pasta were similarly not wow-ed by their orders, giving them an "ok" verdict. It did make me wonder whether our visit coincided with the chef's day off.The dinner was a long drawn out affair, not helped by the wait for the one singular fondant cake which when it came was just unceremoniously put on the table. Obviously they had not factored in the complimentary offer, as when the bill came, we were charged for the item. This restaurant has things going for it - the ambience, the 20% discount for NUSS members, its quiet setting away from the madding crowds and the free parking. Perhaps it was not their day when we visited, but we will not be in a hurry to revisit when there are so many other restaurants beckoning

Tonight my husband and I dined at 7 Adam for the first time. The staff was friendly and professional. The food was prepared by a chef who worked for five years in France and the delectable and delicious deliverables showed the attention to details. The service was exceptional and the food was definitely reasonable. The setting is in a gallery and in an old and romantic black and white colonial house. Very delightful first experience and yes - we will be back

We had one of the best reunion dinners ever. Instead of doing our usual steamboat, we made a booking for 16 adults and 5 children. We were perhaps a tad rowdy, expected for a big family of chinese just a night before Lunar New Year. And kids running around. The crew were patient and attentive. We had the Chinese New Year menu, which is priced at $88, but quality ingredients all round. The crispy pork ventre was so good, and cod was fresh. Ask my 80 year old grandma who has a wretched tastebud. She can't stand the slightest fishy smell but she had high praises for the cod. We sauntered around the restaurant, admiring the paintings and sculptures after the meal. It was all round a great experience for everyone. Ample free parking available too

Delectable Wagyu Rump Steak - a must-try!
Original 7 Elements presentation. A fun cocktail to try with friends.
3
We have chosen the place for dinner according to TA reviews. It seemed the place should have been fine. Perhaps for those who stay in Singapore it is probably one of the best, for ones who travel a lot and come from Mediterranian country it is average.The first thing that disappointed us - they didn't have a fresh tea, only tea in tea bags. The presentation of the food was nice, the sizes of the portions were small. The betroot salad was tiny (the price of it was 18SD though). My sea food pasta was quite good but VERY spicy. I have eaten it because we have spent the whole day in the zoo and were extremely hungry. My husband's seabass was nice, i regretted that I haven't ordered the same.Overall the athmospere was fine, the service was good but I didnt feel anything special. The food was average and in my opinion was not worth the money we have paid

Visited 7Adam on recommendation of a friend. I was warmly greeted by the arts executive. Heading up the stairs, the service staff Sidek greeted me and ushered me to the outdoors deck. I arrived a bit early but it was definitely worth it. I ordered the deck platter as it was a party of 3 and grabbed the one-for-one offers and ordered the signature cocktail 'Element 7' which is perfecto because my friends get to decide the strength of the liqueur vs the lychee extract mixed with sparkling lemon-lime. A clever and unique creation which they will recommend to those who are trying 7Adam for the first time. The tapas came in soon after the cocktail, the wait was about 10 mins, served hot. My favourites among the 4 items are the Goma chicken and Truffled fries! Soon after digging through the platter and getting lost into conversation with my pals, the resident band started playing and it was at that moment which complemented the food, drinks and ambience. Thumbs up!Service was attentive yet not intrusive and for all this, my part of bill came up to $46++ for a deck platter shared with 3 persons, 2 soft drinks, 2 cocktails and 2 beers. And I'm still smiling.. Will definitely return with my friends

The title says it all.. I have heard of the place many times but never got around to dining here. Really regret not coming here earlier.. The food is awesome! Ok from the minute I reached 7 Adam, I found ample parking space (for free!) within the restaurant premises as this place is actually one of the colonial houses along Adam Rd. Was warmly greeted by the service crew and ushered to the dining area on the second floor. There were acrylic artworks as well as sculptures placed on the walls and all around, and they were actually for sale. So it's like an art gallery too. Ok so I had dinner with a small group of friends there. First I had the mushroom soup which tasted so good and so real, you'll never want the canned ones ever again. For mains, I had the cajun spiced chicken - the portion was just right for me. The chicken was thick and succulent, nicely accompanied with sauteed mixed veges and mashed vitolette potatoes (violet coloured!). I got to taste my friend's salmon trout which was awesome too! You will feel like it's fine dining but the portions are nothing like it. Just nice for us Asians. As for desserts - had the chocolate fondant with vanilla ice cream. I'm never one that goes for anything chocolatey or sweet stuffs, but I'll definitely get this again. Vanilla's my favourite ice cream flavour and it foes so well with the fondant that has warm chocolate oozing out.. A must-try!I also had the opportunity to try a new cocktail served by the friendly manager - Element 7. Ask for that if you're there!I had a tour of the whole restaurant as I see it as a potential venue for future lunch meetings and I will definitely bring clients and colleagues here as there is a private room that can accommodate up to 16 pax. Can't wait to be here again! There is also an outdoor dining area, with a stage. Such a pity the live band only performs on Saturday nights.. Will catch that the next time I come back :

Great food and great service.Ambience is unique. For people who love art and food truly! Made arrangments for celebration for a birthday and everything went accordingly and was followed up very well. They even threw in a surprise complimentary cake. The birthday person was very happ

It was on the recommendations of TA that I chose to dine at 7Adam. My wife and I enjoyed a nice anniversary dinner here, and truly loved the experience. On arrival, one of the staff welcomed us and held our taxi door open while I paid. We were brought to a well-situated table with good view onto Adam Road, and immediately given the menu for perusing. All 3 waiting staff served us, and we had the opportunity to engage with each of them. All showed their ability to handle small talk, and at the same time share more about the restaurant and the chef. This is a big plus for service. I did have to ask for the wine-list, which was the only blemish of the evening.We had 3 courses each, and the portions for each course are sensible, such that we were not comatose from over-feeding after dessert. The dishes we tried were: - Entree: chef's signature "Risotto of Sprouts", which was very nice and imaginative. The use of sprouts provided an interesting texture, and its distinctive taste is unavoidable (which I guess is the chef's idea); however, they were unable to absorb the flavours imparted by the oysters and the mousse. A very well executed dish, nonetheless. - Entree: Hokkaido scallops. The scallops were cooked nicely, with light charring that beautifully accented the taste of the morsels. The accompanying salad & dressing provided nice zing against the rich shellfish flavour. The only downside: scallops were smaller than I had hoped. But it's ok, we enjoyed this dish.- Main: Grilled cod-fish, on rice with eggplant and french beans. This has got to be the most delicious rice we have ever eaten in a "western cuisine" restaurant, so amazing with the bits of eggplant and french beans tossed in. The codfish was very well cooked, which flaked away perfectly. An excellent dish!- Main: Grilled Angus beef tenderloin, with truffled mash and vegetables. We appreciated the small dollop of mash (which btw was fantastic!), and generous serving of yummy, lightly fried vegetables. The beef was very well cooked to medium. - Dessert: Tiramisu, with coffee ice-cream & coffee emulsion over biscotti. This is coffee galore; no espresso required! The tiramisu itself was lovely, and not too sweet like how many places do it. We loved the understated sweetness, which allowed us to enjoy the actual flavours.- Dessert: Poached apple with Calvados. A decent alcoholic hit, but in a nice way. The rum & raisin ice-cream was a nice accompaniment to the nicely poached apple over crumble. Again, not too sweet, which is great.We had a bottle of ARA Select Block 2010 Pinot Noir (Marlborough, NZ) o go with dinner. It was very well priced, and an enjoyable wine. Should have been served slightly chilled, but this is something many restaurants in Singapore don't do.Overall, a very nice dinner experience. I was impressed with the service, but the food really was beyond good, for the price you pay at this restaurant. Many have said: good value, and I agree wholeheartedly! Highly recommended!! :

Nice ambience & setting with an exceptional service! Lovely place for a group of friends to have dinner and catch up. And also a romantic place even if it's for couple. There are beautiful and unique art pieces for sale and if you are an art enthusiast please visit this place. Will want to come back again

This restaurant was greatly recommended to me numerous times by my friend Shahirah, who is part of the service crew. Now that i have visited this place, I see the reason why. As my friends and I entered the restaurant, we were greeted by an array of artwork being displayed in the first storey. I was personally very delighted as you wouldn't expect a mini gallery when visiting a restaurant, It just added that certain "oomph" to the whole experience.We proceeded to the outside deck to be seated. Oh wow, let me tell you; the view and the serenity of the place just seemed to instantly relax us. The food was great and the service was very good too. My friends and I had a really good dining experience. I would definitely come back again

What makes you remember a meal at a restaurant must be the quality of food and the service that you get. This restaurant excels in both. The chef presents his carefully chosen prepared food with a sense as if your plate is the only one that he puts his personal attention to. It looks so individualised. The service is attentive and not obtrusive
5
Fine dining meets Art and is laced with a romantic ambience. That is the perfect summary of my trip to 7 Adams about 2 weekends back. You will be greeted with several works of art starting right from the entrance. However, it’s the ambience at the outdoor dining area that worked magic for me. Imagine, being away from the hustle and bustle of city life, the live band playing your favourite hits with a gentle breeze hitting your face while having your dinner and drinks. It’s a perfect place for a first date or to unwind with your pals. The friendly staffs complement the memorable experience and go out of their way to make you comfortable and feel at home. Their portions are more than adequate enough for a person and if you are a coffee person, you have to try the espresso martini! The prices are reasonable and I am definitely heading back again for drinks and the ambience. I might have just discovered a new place to hang out with my girl pals on a Saturday night
