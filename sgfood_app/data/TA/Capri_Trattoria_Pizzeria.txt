The lemon cake is one of the best I hv tried. The grilled cucumber & egg plant was good too. We also enjoyed the large ‘pizza puff’

Read about this restaurant in blog that spoke about it's authentic Italian pizza.
I ordered a Verdure and it was yum! The beer (that came in bottle that looks like wine) was a perfect match for the food we ordered.
4
Authentic Italian pizza with an amazing beer never tried before : “Birra artigianale Collesi”.
The staff is very kind and the place is small but comfy.
Strongly recommended.

Decided to have Italian this evening and did not want to travel far. So I decided to swing by Capri which was literally 5 minutes away. Ordered a pizza marinara (they did not have it on the menu but whipped it up for me nonetheless). Liked the crust and the also they were generous with the seafood ingredients. I also ordered the seafood soup - again I could not find it on the menu but I saw the soup being served on many tables! It was delicious - a thick tomato broth with lots of fresh seafood. It was so tasty that I kept dipping my bread in the soup

By far the best Italian food I've had which is authentic and doesn't pinch the pocket. Had the pizza, mushroom risotto and penne arrabiata. Also loved the cherry panna cotta. Highly recommend it! It is definitely my new favourite. It's small, cosy and homely. The service is super and fast. Great ingredients and warm hospitality, it cannot get more Italian

Followed up on a recommendation from a girlfriend, and dropped by Capri last night for dinner. We were met at the door, given excellent food recommendations, service was prompt and pleasant. We can feel the care given to the food prep and execution. We started off with scallops and button mushrooms, and couldn't help but smile when the dish arrived: the chef had reconstructed a mushroom using scallops and mushrooms. The sear on the scallops was perfect with just that bit of char flavor, and the mushroom was nice and juicy. A sprinkling of flavored breadcrumbs added a nice texture and smokiness to the dish. There's something special about the way the mushrooms were prepared for the creamy porcini mushroom pasta because it melted in our mouths, but still had a bit of bite to it. We were intrigued, and polished off every, little bit of that dish. I have a soft-spot for stews, and was impressed with the fish stew served here. My BF also had lots of good things to say about it, and he is usually quite reserved with his comments. The stew was thick but not heavy, very comforting. Every bit of seafood in the stew was cooked just right. It is so nice to bite into a tender, juicy bit of seafood. I am certain all of us have had our share of chewing-gum like calamari! We rounded up our dinner with the chef’s recommendation of tiramisu and homemade lemon cake. Made with almond flour, the lemon cake was moist, and was all about the lemon flavor, minus the usual overwhelming, sourness from it. An easy favorite. Tiramisu was lovely too, but to me, it would have been perfect with a bit of liquor ;). There's nothing shi-shi about Capri - it is a cosy neighborhood eatery, with pleasant service, serving absolutely amazing, well-made food. What really added to our experience was the interaction we had with the owner, the chef and the wait staff, talking about food, beer, wine, life experiences... Thank you for a great evening. We will be back for more food and banter :)

I have reviewed Capri before and given it the maximum stars possible - it really was a great place to have home cooked Italian food in Singapore in a relaxed jovial atmosphere.I think it still is - but during my last visit, I found couple of items that were not up to their usually great standards. On the positive side, they have expanded their menu with some new items and that’s always good news.The not so good item for me was their baked egg and cheese with truffle oil appetiser. Their was no integration in the ingredients - I was just eating baked egg in one bite and then baked cheese in another. Also, the dish was over baked making the egg extremely dry in taste.The next one is a matter of taste - my Wife found the dish delicious and fine, but I found it delicious and a bit salty(seafood squid ink ravioli)- I was less upset about this as the dish was definitely a great idea and the crabby stuffing of the ravioli was awesome.Overall I think Capri is still one of the best Italian restaurants in SG, however, they should keep an eye on QC to retain their impeccable quality and taste.Best,Abhise

Amazing, outstanding, super!!! These are the 3 attributes to describe our sunday's lunch at Capri:pizza for starter was wonderful and later a fantastic risotto porcini, a delicious risotto agrumi, wonderful gnocchi and turbot fish...and finally a sweety tiramisu to a real happy end!!!...thks Fabrizio and Marco!!!

Came with high expectations but was let down. Only dish that stood out for me was the burrata with parma ham which came at a costly $40. My fish stew was very average and, for me, rather bland.
5
Food quality was excellent and the service level by the owner and the servers were also very good. The restaurant has a nice cosy ambience which we enjoyed very much.
5
The food was good and came promptly.. Service was great.. Server was pleasant and awesome throughout.
5
tranquility and ambiance of the place is superb! felt like i’m at home and the food is absolutely delicious!
5
Restaurant named after the enchanting island nestled in the Gulf of Naples. Cosy venue, friendly service, outstanding Italian cuisine featuring freshly homemade pastas and main courses from both Northern and Southern Italy. Wines are excellent but reasonably priced.
3
It is a simple restaurant with warm ambiance. There is a touch of Italian authenticity here. We enjoy its pasta and pizza here. It offers a decent wine when you do not feel like having a bottle fro your table.
5
Top restaurant even if it was in Italy. Great quality, simple but effective combinations.
And, last but not least, fair prices (cheap for being in Singapore).

This is my second time there. The first time was very good, this time was excellent. Some dishes are great, service is good and the Italian manager is very warm and nice. One of the best home made Italian food in Singapore for sure
4
This restaurant is convenient and easy to access as it is a few bus stops away from King Albert Park MRT Station! Had the crab meat linguine and the seafood pizza which was great. The restaurant is not too big and there was a homey and great ambiance to it. However, service can be improved as servers could have been more cheerful and friendly to make the dining experience more pleasant. However, this is still a good place for couples, families and friends to dine at
5
This restaurant is an Italian island in Singapore! Not only the food is very authentic Italian, but also the owner and his team. The atmosphere makes you feel like with friends and the food is more than delicious. The restaurant is not too big, but not too small - just nice for a dinner for two or a group lunch with friends or business partners. I can absolutely recommend Capri!
5
Had the veal ravioli and truffle sausage tagliatelle, as well as some pizzas. All were done perfectly, especially the handmade pastas which were wonderfully al dente. The owner was also very friendly
5
Food is delicious! A little jewel gem in the neighbourhood setting. Had a great time with my friends.
4
Good food and service. We will return and recommend to friends and family. Ordered a pizza and a pasta that was not on the menu. No problem to accommodate.Thank you.

Last night I celebrated my wedding anniversary at Capri's.My 15 guests and I, we were treated to a smosgarbord of Italian culinary delights freshly prepared a' la minute by the two Italian Chefs helming the culinary team: Mr Fabrizio Anzolin from Milano and Mr Marco de Cecco who hails the North-Eastern Italian region of Friuli Venezia Giulia.This cosy and welcoming venue is located at a stone throw from King Albert Park MRT underground station and right close to a famous Singaporean historical landmark reminiscent of a bygone era: the World War II Bukit Timah Railroad.Live North Atlantic Boston Bay lobsters are served with freshly homemade pasta, all sausages and most cold cuts such as the Northern Italian "bresaola" are entirely homemade while Chef Marco's citrus risotto with fresh prawns tartare was simply perfect.Service was quick and attentive despite the huge crowd on in-dining regular guests and walk-in by-standers waiting for their own table.Will definitely come back!!!!

The restuarant is tucked in a small lane near Binjal lane. It’s family owned Italian restuarant. Restuarant decor was very much simple and gives the Italian ambience. Service was attentive and crowded on a Saturday evening. Book in advance but worth the wait. We had Scamorza del fornaio as appetiser. It was smoked cheese baked in a crock with button mushroom, egg white, topped with Parma ham and a sprinkle of white truffle oil. We ordered red wine by the glass.For mains I had Fettuccine alla Piemontesewith cream, truffle sauce, porcini mushrooms and dried beef. This was simply delicious! My hubby kept picking at my dish. The mushroom was really good. They made their own dried beef cured for 3 months. The Truffle sauce really came together nicely with the pasta. Exquisite.My hubby had the Linguine con granchio which is Linguine served with a delicate sauce of crabmeat in light tomato sauce. It was a simple dish but very well flavoured with plenty of crab meat and sauce. I also couldn’t help picking at his plate. For dessert we took their recommendation and had Lava cake. This is their own homemade flaming chocolate cake with orange liquor. Get ready for some fire as when they serve it.The chocolate serving was rich and plenty, unlike most cakes that had flour , this was filled with chocolate. We had a good chat with the family, such a lovely family with two sons. The owner came from Milan 25 years ago and settled here. We had the good luck of trying some Italian cognac.Totally a lovely night and money well worth

The last time I wrote a review here was about 2 years ago, so I thought I should write another one.Capri still consistently delivers the best Italian meal experiences that I've ever had in Singapore. Pretty much the entire menu has something special to offer and we've found it worth going out of one's comfort zone to try different things.One thing you can say about Italians: they understand the quality of bread served, and the difference between European and Malaysia tomatoes.Atmosphere and service is great (can be a bit noisy on busy weekend evenings) and if you make the effort to be polite and friendly you'll be rewarded.Word of advice: the best time to visit is during weekdays (lunch or dinner)... the place can be busy on the weekend and it's not unknown for certain popular dishes (*cough* burrata *cough*) to occasionally sell out if you are a late diner
4
Ordered a folded pizza and linguine for lunch with the family. The folded pizza is really unique filled with cheese, pizza bread was baked til very chewy. The linguine and the sauce was delicious as well. Pricing is affordable and worthwhile for the food quality we get
5
Visited Capri for a birthday celebration and will go back again! Although it was really busy that night, the food came reasonably quick, was delicious and service was pleasant. Their risotto with citrus and prawn tartare was a great choice too that was refreshing and light o bathe palette! We also had their homemade gnocchi which had a fresh springy texture to it, generously coated with cheese making it a strong and tasty dish.After telling them about the birthday celebration, the Chef also prepared a homemade panna cotta which was a sweet (and delicious) gesture.Will be back
5
My friend and I were craving for pastas and Capri Trattoria's pasta were authentic flavored, freshly made and of good portion. We enjoy every bit of our pasta and left truly satisfied. Will be back again soon
5
I've read about this restaurant on different blogs - claiming it to be one of the best places in Singapore for authentic Italian food. After visiting a Friday night I must agree. By far the best service we've experienced in Singapore. The owner - Italian but has lived in Singapore many years - was extremely friendly. The food was superb. We had the home made Breasola as a starter then pizza for main and Tiramisu for dessert. The Breasola was amazing - melted in the mouth. Perfectly seasoned. The pizza was very good tasting (the ingredients were if very high quality) and with a perfect dough. Finished with an awesome Tiramisu and double espresso which also was very good. You might think I was paid to write this review but that's not the case - me and my wife genuinely thinks what I wrote above. We will definitely come back and recommend anyone who wants superb Italian food to come here
4
Quaint restaurant that serves tasty Italian fare. Ordered an assortment of items but I liked the Fettuccine alla nocerina (pork sausage pasta) the best. It was al dente and the pork/sauce was not overpowering. Will come back for this. The Tartufata pizza was pretty yummy too.
5
Cannot imagine there is such a good Italian restaurant in that quiet residential neighbourhood. The food is superb. The décor is simple but nice. Friendly waitresses and waiters. Good value!
5
Capri is amazing, from the service to the food. It was unbelievably good. My friends and I had really good food over there. I would recommend the oven baked homemade pasta. I have tried homemade pasta in a few places and was always disappointed by it but the pasta here was really good. Props to the chef who came out to ask us about the food and for making such wonderful food.
4
We had seafood stew, pizza and pasta all are good. Only lava cake i find it is more like eating choco sauce. Too little flour
5
Having been there for the 3rd time, the food nevev fails me. They made one of the best pizza! The dough was not heavy and sticky nor too thin! Not just the pizza, you gotta try the truffle pasta as it was homemade by the Italiam Chef in the kitchen! The boss and Anna always make you feel at home while you are dining in their Trattoria
3
Returned for an anniversary dinner. Food was good but in a half full restaurant on a weekday evening the staff were less than attentive. The manager sat at another table all evening chatting to friends. He could have made more of an effort with other customers and helped when we wanted to orde
5
I have been eating at Capri at least once a month ever since I discovered it. The truffle pizza is very unique and the pasta is by far unbeatable. The owner and chef Marco have created a very cosy place to dine and Chef Marco do offer some off the menu dishes if he is able to pop out of the kitchen. My go to place for any pasta cravings
5
I was looking for enjoying with pizza my Sunday. I got TripAdvisor suggestion about this Italian trattoria...outstanding pizza (and not only) in a very warm environment with a lot of attention by the owner Fabrizio and the Chef Marco. I will come back soon Nor only for the fantastic pizza but also to enjoy others from the really high end menu this restaurant can offer...Super good!!!
4
We came here as we couldn't book anywhere else last minute, lucky they had a last minute cancellation. However it turned out to be a very enjoyable experience. Both the starters and mains we had were good. Wine list was extensive and not overly taxing on the wallet. We had a good bottle of reasonably priced prosecco
5
What a find! We loved the beer and prosecco and the fungi truffle pizza - yum! Polite, efficient, friendly staff, too! We will return
2
Came here without a reservation and was seated at the table outside due to full seating in the restaurant. We ordered Ravioli (Special) and Calzone Pizze, but was quite disappointed with both. Ravioli (Special)'s skin was slightly thick but yet it tasted like it was slight overcooked. Calzone Pizze was too plain (2-3 slices of ham, mushrooms, cheese, with tomato puree) for my liking with loads of flour. Service staff was unattentive, it felt as if it was out of sight, out of mind. We requested for water to be served but did not come. The service staff did admit that she forgotten it and immediately served our water. The serving time difference between the Ravioli (Special) and Calzone Pizze was approximately 8 mins.Comparatively, the customers who came after us (& were given seats in the restaurants) were served before us. We also ordered the Torta al limone and Lava Cake. Torta al limone was ok, what tasted good was the cream that came with it. The Lava Cake came still with the flame on the Orange Liqueur, but the cake came out prematurely. It looked more like Chocolate Lava creamy soup instead of a lava cake
5
The restaurant it cool with original Italian style. I recumbent cold cut very nice and pizza so wonderful
Further more there have kind of partner to give the complimentary drink to us.
Will come back again as soon .
Thank you!!
5
Nice, authentic, Italian food in a cosy environment. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone in search for authentic Italian cuisine. Service was attentive yet not overly intrusive, and food was of good quality. Thumbs up!
5
Been here so many times
Owner is friendly and knowledgeable. Ask for the daily specials
Love the Burrata and Squid Ink pasta - best I've ever had!
5
I am a regular customer and has always been satisfied with the food and service. During weekends, they even provide valet service.
5
I was last night with my girlfriend for dinner The owner Fabrizio he is enjoy to provided 2 glasses of sparking wine complimentary The first course is could cut was nice and pizza are perfect and delicious Lava Cake, So we would not forgot to come back again as soon . Thank you
5
Visited Capri Trattoria on a Saturday night. Started with the mozzarella alla caprese which was excellent. Then we had Scialatielli di Capri with seafood and Risotto with prawns tartar. The Scialatielli was very good with a unique thick homemade pasta. The risotto was excellent with great flavor. Finished with a lava cake which was also excellent. The waitstaff and owner/manager were excellent and very attentive. Will return for sure
5
All was perfect, food service and price.The location look like a Italian style. Thanks for a very nice evening.
4
Great menu selection! Cost effective and yummy food! Best baked/smoked cheese ever! If you are in for a good wine selections and love very Italian food, this is a good place to chill-out and enjoy with good company
5
This place serves very well made pizza and pasta's. We had the Tartufata and Margherita which were delicious. We also tried the pasta's and they were mouth watering good however the portions very very small for S$25. Anyway, will be back for more.
5
Valet Parking is very helpful. Lucky we made a reservation for our family of 4 on a Sunday evening. We felt welcome immediately. As a starter we had a plate of cold cuts and gozze in white wine soup. Both very nice. As a main we had a pizza margaritha; tagliatelle with porcini mushrooms, beef and truffle cream sauce; gnocchi and cotoletta milanese. All well prepared and tasty. Portions are just nice. Not small but also not oversized. As a desert we shared a lava cake wich was very delicious. Overall a great, solid Italoan Trattoria
5
The pasta was so good! Menu was amazing with good wine pairing. highly recommend for a relaxing night out
5
Excellent food, great service, lovely atmosphere. Pizza and pasta dishes were delicious. Parking was easy as they had valet
4
Nice and cozy place for lunch. Quiet during the day. Carpark could be a problem though. Food is unpretentious, authentic Italian. Great place with good Italian wines.
4
Just good, simple and authentic Italian food! Really worth every cent! Great place for families too!!!!
4
Whenever we feel like having good authentic Italian food Capri always comes to mind. The pastas never disappoint
5
Their pizza was one of the best I've tried, with crusty, airy and tasty dough. Great food, great service! Will definitely be back.
5
We ate here for the first time last night along with my parents who are staying with us. We live pretty close by and were trying this for the first time as a local neighborhood restaurant. We liked the look as soon as we walked in... place had a very Authentic Italian look and nice ambience with most of the tables full. The owner was very engaging and helped us pick out our meals, to the extent where he suggested something different to our original order for a number in our party. This was in a very friendly way and we took his word for it.... we weren't disappointed as all of the food was great. The fact a number of the produce is made on site is an added bonus.... including the cold cut meats and sausages. Two bottles of wine were also recommended by the owner... again spot on. Service was good throughout and price was good value for what we had. Throughly recommended and we'll definitely be back soon.
4
When I arrived, the place was already looking to be filled up as more patrons were arriving too. And I was pleasantly happy with it as this showed that the place must be serving good food and providing a good service too. Indeed these were true. We went straight to the lobster pasta and followed by the costata skipping the starters. The food are rustic home cooked style and are good! I especially like it when they left us a plate of sea salt flakes and pepper mill to season our own beef steak. In this way, u can go more peppery or saltier, entirely up to you. We had a good bottle of barolo with our meal and that completed the whole dining experience. Will be back again.
3
Great food, but as soon as we whipped out the voucher we'd bought, the service went straight downhill from there.
2
Service was bad and food was mediocre. Server forgot an order even though we repeated many times. Mains was served before appetizers and mushroom soup was not served hot
5
Good steaks!
Very tender
The pasta are all homemade which is different normal italian restaurant.
Overall ambience was good
5
I wrote a review before, but it seems to have been removed :(
Just want to write it out there again, this place is really an awesome Italian joint with a great atmosphere, friendly staff and amazing food.
5
It was great to visit with some good friends and have the staff and chef welcome us in for dinner. The food was great and I got to try some Italian craft beers which I'd gladly go back for. Haven't seen those labels anywhere else and I recommend trying at least one! Had the Kakao pasta with walnuts and it was surprisingly addictive. Will definitely go back soon to try their pizzas and I hear they cure their own ham too! Oh and definitely ask for some Jumping Goat to end your meal with :) Thank you Capri for a great night and true Italian hospitality
3
Capri is a very nice place for a date. They have free valet parking. The food tasted good and the wine was fantastic (highly recommended!!). However, I felt that for the price I was paying, the portion size was a little on the small size. Or that it was a little pricy compared to other Italian restaurants that I have frequent. All in all, Capri would be a great place if you're willing to splurge a little :
4
This neighborhood Italian restaurant serves some of the best home made pasta in town. They have about 10 pasta dishes on the menu. Pasta lovers will be happy to know they have an All-you-can-eat pasta promo at $28.5 per head with minimum 2 person to start. We had the assortment of cured meats and scamorza del fornaio for starter which were just alright. Pizza did not leave much an impression. Desserts were very good. The restaurant has a very homely setting. The Italian owner was personally in-charges. Service was friendly, prompt and accommodating. I will come back for the pasta again
5
I made a booking for my husbands birthday just by searching up Italian restaurants. I liked the pictures and I thought the menu on their website would cater for the whole family. I was not disappointed!! We (2 adults, 2 children) found the food to be extremely fresh and honestly, the best Italian food we have had here in Singapore. It reminded us of eating back in Lygon St in Melbourne.We had the Burrata with homemade cold cut meats to begin with. So fresh and creamy, it was very hard not to stop! Mains were a lasagne, a ravioli, a fettuccine and a risotto. There wasn't much talk at the table while we devoured our mains!For dessert we had a chocolate cake (for hubby's birthday with candle!!) and we were also given the panna cotta to try - delicious.We loved our dinner at Capri and would not hesitate in returning or recommending! Thank you for a lovely dinner

Visited with wife for dinner. We took cheese, pasta and bead steak. Cheese was good but something missed out. Pasta was so so. Beaf steak was my favourite taste!
2
We have been to Capri before and we're looking forward to a return visit (with about a year in between). Sadly we were really disappointed this time. They were busy and not coping well. As people entered, tables were pointed at and guests had to make their own way to them. Our starter was acceptable - Burrata con prosciutto crudo ($38) - it was large enough for two to share, but something crisp ( lightly toasted garlic bread) to spread the cheese on would have been an improvement as it is quite hard to just eat mouthfuls of a really creamy cheese. The true disappointment though was my main. I ordered a codfish off their list of "new menu items" Baccalá alla Genovese (probably about $34) It was a codfish with red sauce with black olives. The sauce was actually really nice, but I couldn't even cut the fish with my knife. When I complained the dish was taken away (my dirty cutlery was just put back on the table - luckily there are no tablecloths). It was returned to me, with the cube of fish I had decimated with my cutting attempts, removed. I was told - the chef says this is the way the fish is. I was worried as fish should "flake" and also the colour of the fish inside was not white and opaque at all. I again called the waitress back and said I was sorry, but I was reluctant to eat fish I couldn't cut with my knife - so she brought me a steak knife!Sadly the whole experience was a bit farcical quite honestly. We ordered a Tiramisu to finish and that was fine ($10). We asked for the bill and the Tiramisu was not on the bill but the fish was ($10 Vs $34). My husband took the bill to the counter and said we would pay for the Tiramisu, but not the fish. Our Waitress was there and started speaking Italian to the owner (?), who finally told her to "stop", and took the fish off the bill as well (so both the fish and the dessert were FOC), which was a nice gesture, but sadly I don't think we will go again & as we live within walking distance this is a real shame
4
Small quaint restaurant with an Italian owner from Milan originally. Simple layout but the food was very authentic and the service was excellent. The only waitress around but she was smiley and patient and gave good recommendations on choice of food. The complimentary bread was delicious - something about the texture of the bread that went very well with olive oil and the balsamic vinegar. Ordered the pizzas, the oven baked pasta which was very good. The squid ink pasta was also tastefully done and we had the meat platter which consisted of the sausage, veal and lamb was also very delicious. Overall value for money at this quaint restaurant
5
I went last week at the lunch time and just from the beginning is possible to feel a familiar and comfortable ambience, I ordered a pizza with home made sausage and it was excellent after I tried also coppa and bresaola very tasty , I close my lunch with a coffee and amaretto. Fabrizio the owner with his pleasantness keep you in the real Italian frame, is one reasons more to eat in this restaurant
4
Lovely food we tried the tartufata (black truffle pizza), pastas (linguine vongole, seafood pasta, crab, squid ink). Good value for money and pleasant ambience. Valet parking available.
5
Great food, cozy ambience, best of all, the friendly service. Thanks Fabrizio for making all our Capri experiences enjoyable and very satisfying !
5
A surprisingly authentic and delicious discovery for us, at a time when we were craving some great Italian. The food was memorable, the staff friendly and accurate, and the atmosphere was quiet yet relaxed. I recommended two of the dishes... but in reality they were all delicious.We've already decided to go back regularly - which is pretty unusual in Singapore where great dining is so plentiful
4
Unlike many Italian restaurants dubbing themselves a Trattoria, Pizzeria Capri actually has the pared down look to pass the test. Food is king here, and with the restaurant run by actual Italians it's unlikely to disappoint. It's the ideal place for a casual and affordable meal with your friends where all you'd want is to fill your stomach with real Mediterranean food and wash it down with a nice glass red wine. Capri Trattoria is a few steps out of the way so you won't be overrun by tourists. I had many meals at Capri Trattoria and never been disappointed. Food taste is exquisite, decent size and reasonably price. The staff is much focused. Here you have - a real Italian Trattoria in the middle of Singapore. If you are a fan of the Italian cuisine as I am you can relaxed yourself and stretched your legs a bit, or go for an evening meal. Really worth
5
Delicious delicatessen from Italy. Unbelievable burrata, it was so fresh that it was still bleeding milk. Very good Pizza made with special receipt. The owner, Mr fabrizio is very friendly and can advise the best. Very good place
4
Indeed the Capri is in new Italian hands, and the authentic and passionate owner-manager Fabrizio, brings you back to this true Italian restaurant feeling that reminds you of your last trip to Italy. You just wonder if his Mama would not show up and share some her secrets of home made Italian cuisine. The food is great, cooked with quality products of he best origins. Fabrizio makes an effort to great each guest, and looks after your special needs. He usually will guide you through the menu and suggest great wines, and share his passion.Keep some space for the desserts, and grant yourself a grappa or limoncello; this will make you come back to Capri
5
My friend, his family, and I were at a loose end today and for lunch were debating places to visit in Singapore, when a Google search prompted us to trek from Kembangan to Binjai Park to eat at Capri. There was some good natured wrangling about the distance, but we were to realise soon that we had hit a home run (in English parlance, a sixer)!We parked (outrageously, and illegally, but the traffic warden was in a benevolent mood, and just waved us on, a first for me in Singapore!) just outside the restaurant, and as we walked in, my friend muttered, 'it was supposed to be good, but it is empty!'His words stirred a chord in me and I was about to suggest that we move elsewhere, when the owner (I presume he is the owner, he said he was Italian!) walked up to us and welcomed us in. We sat down, and he offered us some water and suggested that both the Ham and the Air-dried Beef were house specialties, and so rather than compromise, we ordered both. We also asked him to get us some garlic bread, which he did with alacrity, and that is when I realised how prophetic my father is when he says, 'the best number to eat in a restaurant is two; you and a very good headwaiter!' The owner served as our headwaiter, and every recommendation of his was a bulls-eye. He recommended the rocket salad, the ham, the beef, and the eggplant to start, and each one, freshly made, delicious, and reminding me of a bygone era of a mis-spent youth in Italy, was superb. The portions were not overwhelming, but the taste, exquisite. I got us a bottle of wine, which was served a touch less than optimal, and that was my only grouse of the afternoon. The owner recommended that we let the wine chill whilst we sampled the antipasti, and what a treat that was! Exquisite ham, very good beef, superb eggplant, and all of this washed down with some home-made bread, and a not-so-reasonably priced wine, but what the hell, we were celebrating my friend's daughter's successful school grades!My friend's two children were sampling some great food, and they suggested the fish, the fettucini, and a couple of pizzas for the main course; divine! the lobster fettucini came and disappeared without a trace, and so did the pizzas, whilst the fish was cooked to perfection.It was time for dessert and the owner recommended the Zabayone. We also got a couple of lava cakes, and then my freiend's daughter ordered the Tiramisu. As we were polishing these off, the owner came back with some limoncello and some grappa, followed by a good sambuca. We rated the culinary experience as smashing, and asked for the cheque, which was rather reasonable. SGD 500 for the meal for 5 of us, meant that all in all, it was a fabulous afternoon.We were told that the business is mainly for dinner, and it gets quite crowded during the evenings; our lucky day, really, since we got exceptional service to go with a not-too-shabby dining experience!It is a blessing and a curse that places like these lie undiscovered; blessing since the treatment is first rate, and a curse because it will get "discovered", and that would be the end of the personal interaction. Every thing about the place was meticulous, and it will be our endeavor to dine here as often as we can. A special mention of the lady who waited on us, she was unobtrusive whilst efficient, and this made our day.I hope that these high standards are maintained, which will make Singapore worth coming back again. Thank you, Capri, for a serendipitous afternoon, which will linger long after our experience, and may your lovely service continue
5
I was really glad to have found this nice and pretty restaurant that served excellent food. The owner made great recommendations and I enjoyed all the dishes. Really loved the Burrata, their homemade ravioli stuffed with lobster and lemon cake. I also appreciated that the chef would personally greet all the guests, a really nice gesture

Good place, cool staff and superb cusine!We are italian and we could not believe that it's possible to find an italian restaurant with strong italian traditional recipes in Singapore!I would say that if you would like to taste something originally from Italy for example "bavette al nero di seppia, cape sante e frutti di mare" You definitely must go in this restaurant which certainly should have 1 Michelin star! The owner of the Capri restaurant - Fabrizio, is very friendly person with Italian soul and unmeasured kindness! Thank you so much for this unforgettable evening

Very poor service. Waited 1 hour for a pumpkin soup then another 15 minutes for the main dish. We came in at 8.15 and main dish was served at 9.30. Even asking for bread while waiting for the main dish was a hassle . Had to ask twice. Table we were seated was right next to the counter with spot lights flashing on to us making this part of the restaurant really hot. Might be a good restaurant if you are a regular and know the staff but if you are not please avoid. The friendly ' botak' italian guy who used to work there is not around anymore . Next time I wil go next door to Pepperoni at least the service is better and it's value for money

Their pizza is quite good. Not bad italian dishes and pasta. A little expensive for me because of service, maybe can be more interactive and more attention to the guests.
Will chill and be back

I have been at Capri few times now and I will keep coming back! Not only is the food excellent but also the service with the little extra touch of being part of the family now and feeling recognized. If you want to have an excellent burrata or a nice super tasty carpaccio this is the place to go!Can't wait till next time :)Joaki

We tried Capri for the first time with some friends last night. The restaurant was packed and the atmosphere was buzzing. It was reassuring to see that the owner was Italian and he was working hard to make sure all of his customers were happy. The wine list isn't a thick book, as is the case in some places, but for a small family run restaurant we found the wines were interesting and our choice of a good value Italian dry white wine was delicious. When it came to ordering it was hard to know what to go for as it all sounded interesting - and different! This is a local trattoria as you will find all over Italy and the homemade pasta, freshly made fish stew, lamb cutlets and homemade sausages were all absolutely fabulous. We all expected the usual rather ordinary fare found in most Italian restaurants here (unless you are paying double for Osso or similar) but what we got was way above that. It is hard to recommend a particular dish as everyone raved about their choices. I had the fish stew - laden with fresh mussels, crayfish, squid, large prawns and white fish with a white wine and tomato sauce and toasted foccacia to mop up the soup. We shared some puddings. The lava cake arrived flaming, and oozing with a rich chocolate sauce, the tiramisu was deliciously light and we would like the recipe for the chocolate ice cream because it was some of the best we have tried! Finally the owner made our evening bringing complementary limoncello for us to try - yet another touch that showed us that he cares enormously and wants his customers to revisit.As an ex magazine food editor and author of four cookery books I am always striving to find exceptional places to eat and Capri ticks the boxes for me. It's not smart, you might have to wait for a table, but it is definitely my new favourite choice for a local good value eatery where you can guarantee the owner will remember you when you return

This was our fourth visit to Capri over the last 18 months and we decided not to go there again. Sad to see a good restaurant go down in both Service and Quality. We stood at the door waiting to be seated for 5 mins. The staff (all new faces) saw us but were too busy to usher us in. Finally my husband prompted them to get us seated. We ordered Burrata for starters that came in straight from the freezer perhaps since it was hard and had none of that gooey oozy texture that makes it so irresistible. The owner or someone who looked Italian and important enough came by to ask us how it was after we were done. I told him it was way to cold and hence was disappointed. His only comment was " We store it in the freeze" I said to myself - Duh!!!! Ofcourse you do ! However do serve it appropriately!!!! For the main course our table had ordered Osso Bucco which was good but not fantastic. Meat was well cooked but the risotto lacked seasoning. Our kids had ordered a pasta and a pizza which was okay too but nothing special. I would have given the place another chance if the service would not have been so lackluster. The lack of good service spoiled the experience and I am sure there are many better Italian places in Singapore that would appreciate customers

I had my best burrata in Singapore at this place and also very good pizza and pasta.Been to many Italien restaurants but most of them are overpriced with only average food. At Capri you get value for your money. I'm always looking forward to come back

Went for a friend's birthday lunch today and we were the only table when we arrived at 12.30pm. There was only a lady in charge and a waiter. Service from both was patchy - the lady did not seem familiar with the menu items and the waiter seemed more interested in standing behind the counter. Even at its busiest (which was 3 tables) our water was not topped up and it was hard getting either's attention when we wanted either to order or request for something. Caesar salad was average; beef carpaccio was bland - we didn't even finish it. Main of squid ink ravioli tasted quite nice but was overwhelmingly black to the point of looking quite scary. Lamb shank was only ok. Chef came and served the mains himself and he was friendly and helpful bringing additional plates for when we finished the squid ink ravioli due to the black sauce. Maybe its a weekday afternoon or maybe its an off day for them but the meal was a disappointment. The only saving grace was dessert which was the lemon cake which was delicious. Hope they can up their game because in Singapore its a case of too many places to eat and too little time to eat it all so if they continue in this vein, they will find it hard to survive

We are Italian and have visited this restaurant a few times already. The Antipasti are really good and really italian. Affettati and Cheese are really my favorite, I like their tagliere.The Primi Piatti are sometimes a little strange for me, but in average the quality is good. The pizza baked in the typical Forno a legna locally built by the previous owner, is very good, I like their calzone very much. Also the secondi piatti are nice but we had a very limited selection so far. The typical sweets from Campania are very good, like the torta caprese. The wine selection is limited, but ok. The food is fresh and the quality is good. The atmosphere is very familiar and people are friendly. The restaurant recently changed ownarship from Luca to Fabrizio, both Italian, we could not appreciate any difference.The place is small and the reservation is required. Parking around is not bundant but I suppose there is a car valet service just outside (I have no car, so I'm not sure)

Everybody love it.I will definitely go back there and I do reccomend to everybody.I did not try the pizza, YET, but from the foccaccia i had, i do believe will be my next choice.Guys, go there and enjoy

There are times when I really do feel that I have visited a different restaurant than the most recent Tripadvisor reviewers and this was most definitely the case with Capri. We 100% loved it!From the moment we arrived the service was impeccable. We had reserved an outside table and Braba, our charming waiter, immediately replaced my companion's chair with a more comfortable one from inside when he saw that he walked with the aid of a stick. We asked about specials and chose the Vietnamese clams as a starter. They were simply and beautifully prepared, juicy and garlicky, and a delicious light beginning to the meal. Mains were spaghetti aglio olio with prawns and the pizza tartufata. I had requested an amendment to the pizza, which was accommodated without any fuss. Both were absolutely delicious. The red wine we requested was out of stock, but we were offered a more expensive bottle at no extra charge - the epitome of good service in my view.We decided we really had to try the lava cake for dessert and it was spectacular. Flaming and sizzling around a bubbling ring of Grand Marnier, it was the perfect end to a delicious lunch.Bravissimo, Capri

Bland food from a menu that didnt have that many good choices. Nice enough wine though which saved it a bitBut we wont be going back, which is a shame as its a 5 minute walk from our house and we love Italian food. Do yourself a favour and choose a different Italian restaurant there are far better choices out ther
