If you stay near there I strongly recommend to dine there because of big and fresh Alaska king Crab , it is fantastic menu. I design half for chilli and half for black pepper , both are impress a lot

It was the must-visit restaurant when I was traveling to Singapore in the past 5 years. I really like the cream crab which is seldom available in other restaurant. But I found it disappears when I visited it again at 18th Oct 2015. Nobody told me in advance, no info posted on tripadvisor!I have to spend 150SGD on taxi to go to another outlet (Defu Lane. 91 Defu Lane 10 #01-01 Swee Hin Building). The cream crab is the same, but I really miss the one at flyer

The restaurant has a great location just underneath the Singapore Flyer and good view to waterfront. Fresh seafood but not delicious enough for fine dining expectation. With selective promotion everyday you can get a good deal just under $30 per person. A little bit disappointed as they have only one brand of wine.Nice staff but not everyone can communicate clearly in English
5
Business dinner with customers is good with spacious environment inside and good services. The qualify of the food is a mix of very good and excellent but the black pepper crab really stands out. Wine selection is also good.Overall, it is between very good and excellent but if you are staying in a hotel in the Marina Square / Suntec area like myself, the 5 min walk away is a big plus - EXCELLENT

The menu looks very much the one of Jumbo seafood. But maybe because I am so found of the other one, I find this one pale and boring (i am speaking of the location under the Singapore flyer). The live fish (we had garoupa) is very good, but the rest, beef, calamari, crispy squid, firied rice, baked shrimps was one or two leagues below where it should be and where it still is after so many years at Jumbo Seafood

We were looking for somewhere eat after we came off the flyer , it would not have been my husbands choice but he agreed to try it , the food was fantastic ,crispy prawns with wasabi mayo , then we ordered pork belly , but I think we got ribs , beautiful flavour but hard to eat, the waitress was not very friendly but the food made up for it ,we ordered a glass of Shiraz and when it came he had poured them but said the only one they had was merlot , a bit hard to say no when they are poured , the other funny thing is they bring you a little bowl of nuts then they charge you for i

The place supposed to be famous for chilli crab. My first time eating chilli crab; I like the black pepper betterthe service was averageIt is a good location in Singapore for a nice evening out; the place is a bit pricey so you could get better value in other place
4
I personally like this restaurant because of location and quality of dishes. Service was 'okay'. For this time, I think I had better service provided compared to other times. Even from the lady who took our booking, Maggie. She seems to be trained very well. I work in a hotel business, so I can immediately catch that. The only thing is they sometimes try to upsell alaskan king crab at a ridiculous price, but this didnt happen for this visit. Will I go back? I will definitely go back to this place.

Was craving for a good chilli crab so boyfriend brought me there. In fact my craving was satisfied. We also had their ribs which were delicious. Food is fresh, it's a nice restaurant but i'll advise you to go in groups as it's much more profitable. No washroom you gotta go to the flyer
4
Having a couple of days in Singapore we explored the big wheel (Singapore Flyer) area and found this great restaurant. Service was immediate and friendly and the food was exceptional both in flavour and presentation. The crisp fried baby squid was a tasty experience and the Thai-style smoked duck was beautiful. On top of all this the outlook over the water to the gardens made for a very pleasant couple of hours
3
This restaurant is located underneath the flyer. It is large and busy and service for groups is unfriendly and slow. Average food. Probably best for parties with small numbers.
5
Nice Place, worth to visit! You can find nice food for your taste. I will happy to visit again. I will recommend to my friends.

I love the place. Tasty crab, prawn. Nice staff! Comfort atmosphere! Great night view from restaurant. Although prices are expensive, its worth to pay!

We ate here after going on the singapore flier. This restaurant is actually part of the flier complex. It was nice to walk into, cloth tablecloths but be warned! They automatically serve you pickles, little vegetables and appetiser peanuts, which you are charged for! Aswell as the hygiene towelettes!The food was very good.It is a little annoying that nowhere so they display the prices of the crabs-all their menus just say "seasonal price"You have to ask for a bowl/plate for your empty shell, glass of water and serviettes.We were served quite quickly as we are here clearly in the off peak time and we had lunch here not dinner.Overall a great meal-not cheap though! Very tasty chilli crab, seafood fried rice and oyster vegetables, but the waitress may try to take the bill from you before you have even had any time to put money into the pouch.Having said all that we would come back again

Amazing seafood though a bit touristy and expensive due to the location. The atmosphere is very nice with a high quality feel and fish tanks. The outside is also quite nice as it is on the water. The chilli crab was phenominal. Very messy but the sauce was so spicy, flavorful, and delicious. Cracking it open and dunking in the sauce was fun and tasty. The only problem was the waitress hovering over us while we were eating and talking loudly awkwardly close. Delicious food with a corresponding price.

I am a vegetarian so was not expecting any vegetarian dishes here. However as it happens they do have vegetarians choices. The host served 2 small vegetable dishes (I wasn't really sure which one to go for). They were really good! The non-vegetarian guys liked them too. One was made up of beans and the other of tofu. The tofu in the red sauce is really good. A Must try
1
Was recommended to go here by our concierge. We were taken to table and sat for 15 minutes listening to other tables complain about the service and the food.After another say 5min we decided to walk out as no one came near us.We eat out regularly and this was a very bad experience as we took more notice of what was happening whilst sitting to be served. It was also very dirty Done waste yr time at this place. Tourist trap...

My second time back at Seafood Paradise, first time I did a dinner, had the crabs, salted egg prawn, fish, and vegetables. Good service, and great food. A little pricey but worth it. The down side to this place is probably the parking, parking at the Singapore Flyer is expensive, even on a weekend, and if you park at Suntec City, you need to walk a good 1.5km-2km to the restaurant

I normally would not give any place such a low rating but the experience we had at the restaurant was one of the worst customer experiences I have ever had. The drinks services is where it all started, my friend asked for a beer four times and after 30 minutes had still not arrived, those drinking jugs of beer got them only after 10 minutes waiting, one guy who asked for a soft drink didn't get his at all! despite multiple attempts and being told it was on its way. He eventually went outside and bought a bottle from the local store!! I am not joking! He eventually got one drink after the food had been taken away. What was worse the waiting staff didn't seem to care at all, no apology just said it is coming.It wasn't that busy, there was no one sitting outside which basically meant it was less than half full, although seeing as outside looked dirty and uncared for them I am not suprised.At this point all my bets were now on the food, we had ordered a fixed menu and whilst there was a lot of it and many courses, there was no explanation of what there were and despite asking for an explanation of the dishes, cloudy fish or fish soup aren't really answers to set the taste buds racing! The food was bland to say the least and the prawns were almost tasteless.So I was 2 for 0, save your money and go to the Tawandang Microbrewery in Dempsey hill, good food, cheaper and right laugh with the band

We normally don't give bad reviews, as we know that each customer's experience can be unique and different at the same restaurant - sometime one receive great service, but some other time, another may receive poor service. However, we think it's our moral duty to warn others, especially tourists, who visit this place."We are regulars and in fact, members of this restaurant. Tonight, we brought our parents from Hong Kong to visit them and the true colors reveal ....We originally ordered the double-boiled soup, baby kai lan with prawn, honey pepper pork ribs and the thai style squid dish. When the first dish - thai style squid dish arrives, we were disappointed and shock ... This wasn't what we normally ordered!They must have thought that we are tourists, as we were speaking in Cantonese this evening and the old manager had left. Little did they know that we stay in Singapore and this is a common dish we normally ordered each time we are here.This time, they gave 9 pieces of pathetic and super small squid, saying that this is the right size that we have ordered. We thought they had mixed up the order as we know this is the small size, but not the size that we ordered. We asked the service crews to check and 30seconds later, the supervisor came back and said this is the right one.We were sad as it becomes clear to us that they are trying to cheat us, and thought that we are tourists. This was the same size when we ordered it as small. We then let them know that this wasn't the first time we came here, and now, it becomes very clear to them that we live in this country. After they learnt that we stayed here, one crew came to us to admit that this wasn't the right size, as she shared that a look at it would have known that it's a small size of the dish.We were disappointed and asked them why they want to cheat customers, and why they want to cheat locals and tourists who visit this restaurant. We did not consume the dish in the end, and learnt that the restaurant manager, Irene, was new there.My friends, if you are tourists, please be prepared that they will give you a small size of the dish but charge you a medium/large size.Please take care

Here again even better than what I remembered butter crab is best ever tasted!! Impressive and cheaper than London by a long way. Best meal of holiday by a mile!!
4
We had a group of 15 and were well taken care of here. The chili crab was good, the pepper crab was even better. We had about 10 courses and all was quite good. I would recommend for group dinners while on business in SG.
5
There is few delicious seafood restaurants along the east coast park , whereby it is near to the beach and very windy sometimes. The crabs are very famous and the prices are acceptable.
3
The food is average and dearly over-priced. The only dish I enjoyed was squid in thai style, it was rather refreshing.
4
When i was in Singapore i just had to try some signature meals. Had the chili crab and several starters, and the food was tasty and well presented. The staff was polite and helpful and i really enjoyed the meal. Good place to eat when in Singapor

Sitting on a nice terrace just below the Singapore Flyer with perfectly cooked fresh seafood can be quite something...IF...There is a spectacular view onto the light shows in the new Marina Bay Park Botanical gardens. You are in awe of the great architecture of the new Marina Bay Sands Hotel...BUT...service can only be classified as absolutely disastrous. Ok, there was a new team member (the button on his shirt showing it -poor guy), but when things have gone wrong already twice in one evening, and neither the supervisor nor the team manager feel responsible for any lack of customer service you remain surprised and angry. It all starts well with three people wishing to serve you even before you get a chance to read the menu.The bottle of wine arrives, it is well cooled, fine. We ordered one starter to share and two main courses (simple tiger prawns..). The starter came quickly, the first main right behind. Only the second person did not get their main dish...for 20 minutes you wait, then you ask, you share the first main and eat the other's food, since you are hungry...after twenty minutes the waiter says, oh, there has been a mistake, I will be back in 3 minutes. Another 15 minutes pass by, with no second course arriving...you ask again, "so sorry, so sorry", it will only be another 5 minutes. Well it wasn't, we had to ask a third time and basically waited for one main course for almost an hour. When you complain, you will receive a smile with "so sorry"...when you ask for compensation in form of a free wine glass (since the bottle was emptied while waiting), you are being told, "no, I cannot do that"...next time I will be back in the KUDETA Lounge on top of the Marina Sands with even a better view and excellent food, which does not cost 250$... One last thing, the toilets are the main public rooms for everyone who uses the Flyer...not very nice after a good dinner either

Went here as a recommend for the hotel! Not disappointed, service was a little intermittent but friendly and knowledgable! This was clearly a place for locals and was better for it! We had the Alaskan crab done half in chilli and half in pepper it was expensive but one easily did 4 of us and it was worth the cost! A very good night had by all
4
We ordered the black pepper crab, creamy butter crab, mantou, baby octopus and bacon with cheese. The crabs and mantou were superb. Baby octopus so so only. Bacon with cheese was great. Ambience was alright. Only problem, no washroom in the restaurant. You'd have to walk to the other end of the shop lots. A bit pricey but was worth it
4
This place was packed even though it's in the middle of nowhere!The food is decent. We had a set dinner. The servings are quite big. Nice change from the usual seafood places which are always quite noisy. This place is classy. More like a decent Chinese restaurant than a Seafood place.

When at Singapore, eat chili crab! The best one according to my wife's parents was at Seafood Paradise (they were able to order it at Seafood Paradise store in the airport)I have always been a fan of the Deadliest Catch (a documentary of Discovery Channel about Alaskan King Crab Fishermen). I have always wanted to try Alaskan King Crab.Seafood Paradise, in September 2013, was selling Alaskan King Crab at S$200 per kg. It was really expensive. The other choice was a Sri Lankan Crab at S$180My wife and I ordered half of an Alaskan king crab and cooked to a Singaporean chili crab.It was delicious. My wife loved the king crab and I loved chili sauce.We also had a wonderful serving of fried rice.Food was great but very expensive, hence the average rating
2
Chili crab was ok, service was horrible. If you wanna eat any SG crab just go somewhere else where you are treated better.
4
Do you like seafood, I do! Eat until you are full in a lovely place.
Remember to finish your vegetables!
4
The chilli crab and the other food was excellent. Service was pretty good but could be more attentive. Overall very good value and well worth a look.
4
Lovely meal had here well looked after excellent butter crab very good side dishes fairly good value. Not the cheapest crab in Singapore but probably the best!! And have tried a few.
4
Pleasant to sit out in the evening. The fresh fish was good and the range of starters was fine.service was attentive
4
We came of the Flyer looking for somewhere to eat, found this place overlooking the river and across to Marina Bay Sands, fantastic view and food was excellent.

This restaurant was recommended to us by our hotel. The service was poor (no napkins offerend, no rice with the seafood or the poultry, we asked for their specialities and followed their recommendations, but the food was not tasty at all. We had different dishes to share, but everybody of our family was just really dissapointed (duck was dry, prawns were boring to eat). Especially since we had just two nights in Singapore, this felt like a wasted evening. And also the overall atmosphere in this restaurant was - at least for us - an oldfashioned style
2
I must say that the food is quite good, fresh and tasty. The restaurant is located in one of the most scenic area in Singapore. The service, on the other hand, is HORRIBLE! I understand that the restaurant is short of staffs, and chefs but I expect a better service! Virtually half of the tables were unoccupied, yet it took them almost an hour to get us one. The staffs are very rude and not efficient. It took them forever to respond to our requests. We also waited for almost two hours before all our food arrived.The staff took our complaints as a request for a discount. Well, they did give us some discount but that should not be the way to deal with this kind of problem. I am really disappointed with this restaurant, especially after hearing so many good things about it
5
The chilli crab is a must! The price is reasonable but make sure to ask first for the price because its according to the season and the weight, but nothing to be scared of! The manager is very nice, he can give you a huge bib if you dont want to spoil your clothes! Great experienc

Awful. We were recommended to this place. Yellow table cloths, a view of a canal. Empty big restaurant. The only ones who need reserve a space are the crabs in the tank. The biggest crab had a little tank to himself, but he was upside down, for who knows how long, he didnt bother to try to get up right, just resigned to breathing only. I didnt order any crab for that reason. But singapore is expensive for seafood. Crab is 160SD per kilo, you need a 1.5kg crab for 2, that Â£120 for a crab. Butter or Pepper sauce or not, thats expensive. (Go to Toddai for a 35 SD buffet and have crab legs as many as you want). The starter of baby fried squid came out like burnt toffee popcorn, they prawn in dried chilli and garlic was like a Tandoori Faol temperature, and the duck pancakes was plentiful but dry. Not recommended. No toilets, you have to use the public toilets 200 meters away. Very pushy waitress almost ordering you the butter crab which we declined. Wouldnt recommend
3
Had a ten course dinner with a group of friends. Found that all dishes are nice apart from the serving.
4
After a ride on the Flyer, retired for dinner and it was very good. The butter crab was really nice, with very attentive and helpful staff.
5
This is my second time to this restaurant for my dinner! Highly recommended is the Crab!

I have often eaten in various seafood restauraunts in Singapore and this is at the better end of the scale for quality - the crab (both butter and chilli) are very good indeed. This was slightly less relaxed and casual than many of the other seafood restaurants that the locals go to - catering slightly more for tourists and business visitors (but with its location under the Singapore Flyer, that is not surprising).However, the price is a little on the high side (it worked out at S$86.25 per head including the beers) but the thing which really annoyed me was that it was really very, very cold in there! The aircon was turned up way to high! I wished I had been wearing a sweater.Other niggles:- * there was no toilet, so we had to use the public toilet at the entrance of the Flyer complex* astonishingly they could not serve coffee after the meal!* I did not realise until later that we had been charged for the towelettes which were provided automatically (twice!) - if I had known, I would have taken them to task over that!I will go back to one of the East Coast Seafood Complex restaurants next time I want a relaxed atmosphere seafood dinner in Singapor

I have eaten at three Seafood Paradise restaurants. This review is on the restaurant at the Singapore Flyer.We ordered the kang kong with cuttlefish, creamy butter crab, salted egg yolk crab, and buns (mian tou). The kang kong with cuttlefish was crispy and tasty. The signature creamy butter crab was delicious. The salted egg yolk crab was yummy although a little dry. The hot buns went really well with the butter crab gravy. Service was okay - no complaints and nothing exceptional either.Sit outside (Alfresco dining) if you want a good view of the Singapore Flyer and skyline.Tip for foodies: Eat at the Seafood Paradise restaurant at the Singapore Airport (Terminal 2). I ate there on two occasions and I found the portions were bigger, the crabs were larger, the food was tastier, and service was more attentive
4
Service - excellent, very quick. Our waiter wasn't great with English, so instead of fumbling our way through making our order another staff member came to take the order which I was happy with.Food - I thought it was quite good. I had the chilli crab ($60 - but worth it. Biggest crab I've ever had and it tasted beautiful). My partner had prawn/egg wet noodles - she wasn't a fan but I thought it wasn't too bad. $25 for a jug of Tiger beer, not much different to anywhere else. Value - ended up being a relatively expensive meal - $170 (jug beer, 1 entree, 2 mains). However I did order an expensive main. Overall - nice meal, great view of the water. We sat outside and saw part of the 8pm light show too. Food was good. I'd probably dine there again, but I wouldn't make a special trip to the area to do so
4
We went to the Singapore Flyer branch and found that the experience appears to be consistent with other reviewers of late. It's really poor form to bill customers for peanuts and hand towellettes especially when they are presented to you as complimentary and part of the service. The staff could engage more with the customers during the meal, other than just refilling the drinks and taking the food orders.That being said. The location is great and there is a lovely view to take in of the marina whilst you are eating. The food is lovely, great value for money and the serving sizes were generous. We had the fish head curry and some fried buns (mian tou) and it was superb. The curry was well balanced with a good mix of fish and vegetables and served in a clay pot on a gas burner so it stays warm as you work your way down to the bottom of the pot . The buns were perfect and were handy for mopping up the rich full bodied curry sauce. Dry and crisp on the outside and pillowly soft on the inside. Delicious

Seafood Paradise has four branches and the outlet at The Singapore Flyer has by far the best ambience and views. The restsurant is famous for their variety of fresh seafood prepared local style but with an innovative twist. However be warned that the service us rather patchy and inconsistent. The chilli crab, creamy butter crab and sauteed razor clams with asparagus in spicy sauce are dishes that must not be missed. Unlike the greasy deep fried butter crab served in the typical local seafood restaurants, the version served here comes bathed in a creamy gravy laced with white pepper, chopped basil, crispy curry leaves and a few specks of bird's eye chilli. The combination of fresh meaty crab pincers and rich, flavourful gravy never fail to send me to culinary heaven. The juicy, crunchy razor clams basted in a spicy chilli sauce laced withdried shrimp and dried scallop is another unique taste sensation that should not be missed. As in most Chinese restaurants, the wait staff will serve tea and tiny plates of peanuts or pickles which are chargeable. You may politely decline the peanuts/pickles if you so wish. Instead of hot tea I usually ask for iced Chinese tea. The server usually brings me a small bucket of ice cubes at no extra charge

This was a celebration dinner for my wife and I and we got the recommendation from our hotel concierge and also checked it out on tripadvisor before we went. We were keen to sample the chilli mud crab in singapore in a more upmarket environment. The staff were quite efficient, not so warm, but not rude at all. The waiter was very good at giving us recommendations about the seafood varieties but you need to consider what he recommends carefully as I am sure he went for the most expensive dishes and there would have been way too much. Our food was delicious and it was very well presented. It wasn't a cheap night - SGD250 for 2 people including a $88 bottle of wine. I was prepared for that but it was annoying given the size of the bill to see a charge of 30c x 2 for serviettes and $1 for what I assumed was a small complimentary bowl of nuts with our pre-dinner drinks. Surely they can do without these charges given the menu prices in order to avoid these small annoyances. The other thing was that for a high standard restaurant that it holds itself out to be, they didn't have any ginger ale mixer. Even though there was a 7/11 in the complex where the restaurant was, we went without.Overall, though, the food is great and so is the location. Just be cautious and prepared

Don't waste your time here.We were shocked by the service and how no one bothered to help us when we shared that we were first time guest from abroad.They never gave us napkins, charged for the peanuts on the table and finally they charged us for the cold wet napkins when we asked for nakpins.Food was average in our opinion. We had better services in the hawker center too
