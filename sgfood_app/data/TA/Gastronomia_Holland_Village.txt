Always feels homey to me. Double baked Almond croissant and their americano is always a consolation I would alwats go back to everytime.
My 7 year old surprisingly love their spinach lasagna. I am the happiest coz she always order this and finishes it up!

This place has relocated to just 5 minute walk from its original spot. Good Coffee and CRODOS. Many different flavors of these Croissant/Doughnut hybrids. Lovely buzzy place

Really enjoy the food at Da Paola. The freshly made pizzas and takeaway desserts are great. Highly recommend the panna cotta and cheesecake specifically. It's economical, the place smells divine and the ambience is nice for a coffee date or even work.

Swinged by on a rainy wednesday at 9pm. The place was half empty, great spacious room where tables had plenty of space in between (mostly for 2 or 4 pax). I ordered a balanced salad (where I chose the ingredients). For 14$ I was able to get a VERY GOOD amount of very healthy food (including salmon). Great place for to have a conversation in a nice chill environment, next to Holland Village MRT. Last order 9.30pm

Sandwiches used to be good value. But they changed their menu and they not advertise them as coming with a side salad and selling for 13 SGD, not too bad. If you have difficulties finding the salad in the picture, like it happened to me, it's because the salad is inside the sandwich! What a revolutionary marketing concept. Now the vegetables in your sandwich double as a side salad... misleading.Coffee is average and you'll find plenty of options to go along with it (like the gorgeous croddo on the picture), but I seriously don't recommend the food.

Came here the 2nd time (sunday 17/7 at 6pm) with the same friend as we like the sandwiches the first time. Ribeye sandwich and chicken sandwich with brie. The beef was overcooked this time so my friend told the chef and chef said "thanks for the feedback" and went back to his work. I had a country bread with chicken, the meat was warm and the tomatoes cold, the bread was chewy, the rocket leaves were soggy. We spent $50+ altogether. We left without finishing, will not retur in future

I have been here numerous times...mostly for a saturday or sunday bfast or coffee. Take note this is more or less a self serve cafe. U order...sit and they bring ur food...u get ur own cutlery and condiments..etc. No issues with that. Casual and easy. A must order is the breakfast with pork sausage and caramelised onions...so delicious. U can have ir eggs anybway but i like scrambled. Served with bread and side greens. Good size portion at abt $10! Singapore is expensive but this is good value! Sit outside and watch the world go by! Cappucinos are good but kalahari rooibos tea is so good!

The food is really rather good and good sized portions. Would recommend the scrambled egg breakfast with sausage and onions, it is delicious. The food is a bit pricey, even for Singapore, and the staff did not confirm the order, or bring cutlery with our meal.

They used to have a wider range of soups but now they have only 2-3 selections, which is a major thumbs down. They do have sets on offer which is pretty decent. Their breakfast meal is good too. Love their pizzas and cakes. Often they run out of coke, so its pretty disappointing. Overall, a decent place to eat for lunch:

The food for breakfast was actually reasonably priced and was really nice. The sausages are amazing and the caramelised onions are great. It's worth getting the breakfast set if you want a coffee too. They have outdoor seating and indoor if you want the aircon. Nice friendly staff too. I would go back
