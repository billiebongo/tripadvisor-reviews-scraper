Very good location. Specially we stayed at Hotel Royal and it was very convenience for us. Good food and fun.

Ala carte buffet style
Love it
There's also a top up for free flow alcohol that include beer, shoju, sake and wine.
So alcoholics and Japanese food lovers.
Don't wait!

We visited Kushi to celebrate the birthday of one of our friends. We were in a group of 8 adults and 1 kid, and had a private room to ourselves. The staff were quite attentative and we didn't have to wait too long for our food after we placed the orders. We found the selection of food as well as the quality of food to be good. The oysters and sashimi were quite fresh, and the green tea ice-cream was quite nice. However, the price for the buffet could be considered on the pricy side. Overall a pleasant dining experience at Kushi

Definitely worth a try!Been to quite a few Japanese Buffet, this is perhaps the best.They may not offer a huge choices but the quality of the food is the best.Located at a quaint hotel Level 3, the dÃ©cor is quiet classic and they have limited sitting capacity, Thus you are advise to make reservation before heading down. Very friendly Chef & serving staff.For 2 pax, the bill will come up to slightly above S$100. MUST try! Fresh OysterPeitan TufuSashim

My family was pleasantly surprised at the quality of sashimi dished out at Kushi, and the variety of fresh food served. If you enjoy sashimi, this is certainly one good Jap eating place. We were also very impressed with the level of service, especially Kelly, who was excellent! She gave good recommendation and the food ordered was brought to our table promptly. For an ala carte buffet restaurant which was almost full-house, this is a big plus. We will return to Kushi soon

Walking into this place at 7 pm on a Thursday, we only saw one occupied table. People started streaming in later. We managed to score a traditional table but regretted it later as pins and needles set in. We ordered with high hopes of a great meal, judging from all the rave reviews online. Things started alright with a selection of sashimi (apart from the scallops and swordfish, the rest were mediocre), and a rather welcome hot lobster porridge. Then came the shockers. The pork enoki was dry, the beef asparagus wasn't what we ordered (I had ordered bacon asparagus), the chicken skin was tough and unevenly grilled.  In fact, speaking of yakitori, they came only after an hour of repeated requests every 10 to 15 mins to check on the order. Which arrived 30 mins after we had finished the rest of our order. And that after kicking up a stink. And after another table, who ordered later but got their order much earlier. I would only recommend this place to gourmands who value quantity over quality. Not my kind of place at this price point

It's an Ala-carte Buffet so everything is freshly prepared upon order. Said to be the best Japanese buffet in Singapore, I was pleasantly surprised to find their sashimi REALLY fresh and generously sliced - probably the best you can get at a buffet! (Better than some local Japanese restaurant chains too.) Pictures from my lunch on my blog http://floraisabelle.com/kushi-dining

As far as Japanese buffet dinners go, this is by far one of the best I have ever had. An authentic Japanese setting, Kushi sets a fine example of fine Japanese dining serving tantalizing spread of fresh, delicious Japanese food.The sashimi slices are thick and succulent, and the Shabu-Shabu is very sumptuous with good broth.For more detailed information and photos, do visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2013/11/dinner-at-kushi-dining-bar.htm
