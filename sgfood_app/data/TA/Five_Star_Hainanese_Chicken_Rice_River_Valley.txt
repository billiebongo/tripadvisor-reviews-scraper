Chicken Rice is very very good here, properly made the Hainanese way. Rice is very fragrant and tasty.
Other than chicken rice, they have a good selection of other dishes, both veg and non-veg, to make a proper and varied launch/dinner.
Very good quality/money.

If you want an authentic "kampong" chicken rice then 5 star is pretty good, the quality is there and the service is good. A little small for the price, you can get cheaper options around but this is good tasting.

yummy very expensive but worth it family friendly, close to our hotel so easy to walk to was busy with locals so we knew it must be good

Great spot, they open early so we were able to grab some chicken rice for late breakfast on the way to the airport!

I have not eaten at Five Star Chicken Rice for many years, mainly due to its average chicken rice and poor service. Thought I would try take-away today at its East Coast outlet. Many servers, very disorganised, disinterested, rude. Asked for the manager but one of the staff said he was not around. Ended up returning my takeaway packet for a refund. Walked 30m and bought from Boon Tong Kee where staff were always had very friendly, knowledgeable staff, and a bit cheaper too

One can't leave Singapore without eating Hainanese Chicken Rice and 5 Star Chicken is now my favorite local place with local prices!The place is very low key and informal. No table clothes. Reasonable prices.We order a whole chicken every time. It can feed 3-4 people. The chicken is moist and succulent. The rice is rich with chicken flavour.I highly recommend this place for price and high quality

It's my first time to try this place after hearing from other people. We ordered the poached chicken (white chicken) and the taste was good, the meat was slightly firmer than the non-kampung chicken found in other places. The rice and chill were also good. My only complain is that the portion for half-chicken seemed small or perhaps the size of the chicken was small. The tofu topped with minced meat was really tasty. Our group felt very thirsty after the meal and we suspect it could be due to MSG. Because of this i'm scoring it a 3 instead of 4

Having just arrived in the city, we popped downstairs looking to try a stable local joint for a full meal. Service was slow, despite the fact we were the only ones there at the time. Strange option to choose "medium" or "large" size, which was ridiculous as our tiny portions arrived, and the waitress explained it was the size of the dish that made the difference (both portions were equally small, albeit some extra liquid on the side).Overall, we left hungry and grumpy. Not a good first impression of food in the city. We were later fed better and enjoyed SG and its diverse food culture a lot more -- but definitely not from this chain

Went to Chatterbox in Mandarin Gallery for chicken rice on our first day in Sing upon the concierge's intro. Disappointed due to the ludicrous pricing. To be fair concierge also suggested 5 Star on the first day.Anyhow - went last night w some local friends. Ordered twice as much - and went with twice as many people. Ended up marginally cheaper (gross) - that's more like it.Ordered chicken plus various dishes of ordinary Chinese food. U don't come here for anything other than the chicken rice.It was decent, chicken was a oily and fatty as some other similar joints, seating was spacious but hardly comfortable. Sufficiently clean and hygienicWould recommend to others.

I went there with three singaporean friends... They loved it but me as a foriegner I will re-think if I will.still go there.... as the name Five Star Hainanese...it is not for the chicken.. for the rice it taste so good and I would give a 5 stars... the chicken I requested breast part they have given me a leg... I saw it so faty looking and I tried to.check under the skin and I saw something like jelly (big layer) attached to the skin and really looks and feels like jelly... I had two rice orders instead. we ordered a fish dish... it taste like black pepper only... I thought it is a chicken ( I said maybe my.friends changed the order) but after we finished I found out it was fish... The staff friendly and not many customers by that time around 2pm. It is easy restaurant to find... clean place but we saw the staff preparing some kinda sauce or something on the next table I dont know if this ok or not for a restaurant staff to do so.... anyhow... be sure to know your food you gonna eat and find other options if possible and if you will try this restaurant be ready and dont keep highier expectations

Must try five star chicken rice. I have had better but this place is good and they offer other food as well.
We tried the Hong Kong Kailan, chicken rice, sweet and sour pork - food was very good.
5
Highly recommended and rightfully so! So good! Located a block away from our apartment which is a two minute walk.

We went for lunch on a very hot afternoon, and the cool interior was a welcome relief from the heat! Great service as we were guided through the vegetarian options. The food was simple but delicious : vegetable fried rice, baby kailan, tofu and omelette, washed down with a tall cold homemade barley+Lime drink
5
These place are near to the place where I stayed in River Valley Road. They offered many chinese food with 2 different portion, regular or large. I bought the regular portion and it's like a large portion in Indonesia.The price also affordable, and can be a good place for dinner. The staff also friendly with their fast service, and I like to come to this place again. A recommended one

Very nice juicy steam chicken with tasty chilli sauce and ginger garlic sauce. We ordered the fried version but in my opinion the original steam was still better. The rice was also very fragrant and not too oily. Satisfactory lunch. One of the best hainan chicken rice I have tried in Singapore
4
You cant visit Singapore and not have the Hainanese Chicken Rice. The restaurant serves delicious Chicken rice freshly prepared alongwith host of other dishes. We enjoyed the spinach tofu as well as sweet and sour pork. It was delicious.. The seating was comfortable and had a friendly family environment. Must try!
5
One thing I love (and miss) about Singapore is their authentic Hainanese Chicken. If you wanted excellent dining experience, dine in here.The restaurant crews are warm and honest. Their smile and willingness to assist will definitely touch your hearts.Their food is awesome and worth every penny. We even availed of their dining discount, which made our experience even better (coz we get to eat more).Their fried rice and chicken dishes are a must try

The queue was too long at boon tong kee next door so we popped over here. It wasn't too crowded but they have hainanese chicken rice too. We also ordered the hainanese pork but that was blah. We ordered other dishes like tofu, sambal kangkong, omelette etc. and they were fine. Hawker fare, nothing too fantasti
4
True to its kampung classification, the chicken here is lean and flavourful. Very good rice, chili and ginger sauces. The ngo hiang is also yummy. But the best thing about this outlet is the takeaway service: They ask for your vehicle registration number, and as you approach the kerbside, somebody rushes out to your car with the exact change (to $50 or $100)! Can't do that at Boon Tong Kee down the same road
4
Recommend this hainan chicken rice with their roasted chicken as well as other ala carte menu which also taste so good such : pork ribs and vegetables selections.
5
Great chicken rice filled with flavor and not oily. Good portion for the $4.20. Bone in or boneless. You won't be disappointed and can't complain for your bang for the dollar.
5
I visited almost every week after playing tennis. All foods are very delicious. In addition, we can bring other liquors (Wine etc.) with free of charge. The price is much cheaper than others. You must try.
4
I travel a few stops to river valley to have my craving for chicken rice. Although the chicken rice is average, it is the variety of food that makes 5 star the choice as i can try their menu. Which complements quite well.
3
The restaurant does not look very inviting and the Hainanese Chicken Rice is not very nice. However, some locals like it here than Boon Tong Kee which also sells Hainan Chicken Rice a few doors away. As for me, I prefer the other one.
4
We needed a lunch break venue after a long morning meeting. Found this cafe by fluke and our cravings totally satisfied, their chicken is lean, moist and tender. So fluffy and fragrant is the rice, I had another bowl!Side dishes were equally good. We are glad we chose this cafe. Excellent value for money
4
Great chicken and rice. Rice was very flavorful. Chicken can be ordered without bones for easy succulent eating.Also had a deboned roasted chicken, cereal prawns, Malaysian style gain lan, tofu dishes, and others. All were good, go for the chicken rice
3
We thought they offered a good value for S$9.8 lunch set which included chicken rice, veggies, soup and drink. But then we discovered the chicken rice was a lot smaller than the average size. We (2 adults and 1 kid) ordered 3 lunch sets and 1 main dish and left being not full.Anyway, we found the roast chicken quite tasty while the steamed chicken too bland. The lime juice was... I have had better in many other places
4
Overall the chicken rice was pretty good. But SGD16 for half chicken / SGD32 for whole chicken is a lot of money for what should be simple local fare. But another place we went to also charged SGD32 for a whole chicken. Barley water also very good and worth trying. Chicken quality is good. Not mushy like some other places we tried. Recommend half steamed chicken and half roast chicken. But eat steamed chicken first since taste of roast chicken is more flavourful
5
Lovely food with lovely service!I suggest ordering the chicken rice roasted and boneless. We also ordered some curry but it was too spicy for us westerners!The fried rice is also quite good. We went so many times as it was dosn the road and really famous
4
Different from mundane food. You have mix the Chinese version of "Chutnies" we'll to bring out the taste to the Indian flavour. The rice is delicious and food safe on the stomach. Edible and tasty to Indian palates.
5
Fantastic little restaurant to eat in or take away. Beautiful Chicken!! Very Cheap and always seems to be open!
5
well used by locals rather than ex-pats and you get the real thing here. The chicken rice and the mee goreng are wonderul
3
This, along with neighbouring restaurants, offer a good selection of late night dining. Chicken rice here is average (better is available at Zion Road Food Court) but I would return.
3
The food was good, but not outstanding, if you want Chinese food then why not give it a try.
4
Their chicken is so so, however, their homemade (jia xiang) tofu is really good. Their desserts portions are really huge too, compared with last time.
3
Overall reliable good quality chicken rice but it is not cheap by local standards. More varieties of other dishes compared to the other chicken rice chain a few doors away. They even allow us to cross-order from the roti-prata shop next door. Quick service too.
4
i came back here for the ginger and chili sauce. of course the chicken and its rice are nice but there are so another better known chicken rice stall just 2stores away. and the serving of the chicken is not that much. but i cant resist the ginger and chili here. so late at night when i am hungry and craving for chicken rice, this is the place for me
4
if you want a reliable hainanese chicken rice spot, this place definitely has it! went here for the comfort food of the chicken rice and the cereal-coated prawns! (even the coating of the prawns are good enough to snack on) the price wouldn't hurt the wallet, so it's just fair. i agree there are many more places such as this eatery but this is our stop for comfort food. definitely left with smiles on our faces. and don't forget to get the home-made barley drink. it'll surely quench the thirst from all the heat in singapore

Since I was in Singapore for a few weeks and I was in the Grand Copthorne Waterfront hotel, I was guided to this place by one of my local colleagues. I wasn't sure and was a bit hesitant as I really wanted to try my first chicken rice at the Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rise in the Maxwell Hawker center but away I went. Let me tell you folks, I was not disappointed. The rice was a little bit aromatic from the stock that it was cooked in and the two condiments chili garlic sauce and sweet black sauce were the perfect pairings. Last but not least was the chicken. The chicken was cooked such that the skin and fat on the top portion were easily separated signifying that the cooking process was stopped long enough to congeal both and providing the perfect cover to the succulent chicken meat underneath. The meat was tasty and when combined with the rice and condiments really provided an ecstatic experience. Over all I would recommend this place to anyone who is staying near Zion road (as I was) and walk a few minutes to this place and enjoy the chicken rice experience
