The food was okay, prices were not too bad but the portions were quite sad. Yes, free flow drinks but wasn't really in the mood after the moderately tasting food.
The place looked really dated and felt really boring.
Standard food, standard price, standard service.

When eating there I ordered a steak which i emphasized should be well done and they gave me steak with blood. Very very upsetting service from them.

You wouldn't expect great Singapore Noodles in Italy. Don't expect great Italian food here.
Boring. Cheap though!

Saizeriya has a chain of restaurants operating all over Singapore serving budget-friendly Italian fare. I have eaten at a considerable number of them and taste-wise, they don't differ much.Prices on menu are nett so there's no additional service charge or GST, which is a good bonus. Considering the dishes they offer, their prices are hence very reasonable.Taste-wise, it is at best decent. The risotto tasted more like porridge in thin cream soup. The gratin was okay; nothing special but no nasty surprises either. The carbonara was relatively dry considering how little sauce there was, although the sauce tasted flat and bland. The mentaiko pasta isn't real cod roe; it is just mentaiko-flavoured so be careful when ordering it. Nonetheless, it wasn't very pleasant-tasting either since it tasted very artificial. The garlic focaccia and the escargots were really good though.Service-wise, it was a hit and miss. We went on a Friday afternoon during peak lunch hours and the restaurant seemed understaffed. There were some who really tried to accommodate to every diner's needs while some looked rather indifferent and nonchalant and were rather unresponsive to our furious hand waves

Under staffed during dinner time. I noticed many customers had to wait before they were being attended to. Staff should be more approachable and friendly. I don't mind waiting if the staff were friendlier. I felt as if I had to be sorry just being present

Have went there together with colleague, the restaurant is filled with people. The set lunch is value for money as the price include a main dish, refillable drink and a salad. The menu also include many varieties of food which is all nett price. I have ordered the chicken steak set lunch and chicken wings, food is served super fast & efficient and the chicken is cooked just nice, tender & crispy. I will definitely went back for its lunch set again, highly recommended to try

We do pop by Saizeriya quite often for dinner as the portions are good and the food is quite tasty. The significant other seems to like their soups and the hawaiian pizza. For me I guess the nicest on the menu would be the carbonara. Good and affordable food especially in Orchard Road where most of the other places will cost you quite a bomb.

The lovely piping hot escagot is done very well that you can dip your bread in the hot garlicy olive oil sauce.The octopus carpaccio is thinly sliced drizzled with lemon juice making it a good starter. The olio sphagetti is done al dente with chopped garlic and chili padi. You can topped your own mozzarella.A drink all you can drinks counter @S$2.80 per pax is generous. To end the meal you can choose a oreo cheese cake or other choices.

I was trying Saizeriya for first time at Clarke Quay. This place is just excellent. Price is very very reasonable. You can have options to have free flow drinks. Then, the food is really good. I would suggest their baked rice and pizza. The taste are good for that price. It is way satisfying. Especially, I love their ESCARGOT! BEST! Thanks Saizeriya for being exist in this city, especially now you are at Orchard, yeay.

Saizeriya is a great place when you have a urge to eat Italian food at a very cheap price. They sell pizza, pastas, calzones and even burgers. I personally recommend the spicy shrimp pasta. It has a soft spicy tomato sauce. The pizza is very thin and it melts in your mouth. I recommend to families and birthday parties

We were looking for some place to eat and we couldn't decide where, so we just walk around finding every resto in the corner and even underground. It's located in Orchard Gateway Basement 1 (Somerset MRT). There's alot to choose from Japanese, Chinese, Indian to Italian foods. I saw this italian resto and we decided to try, it's actually a japanese-italian resto and looks interesting. (Lately, I realized that there was a Saizeriya resto in Japan,too)We ordered this seafood divine pizza, pineapple & bacon pizza, shrimp & brocolli pasta. To be honest. they're really good! When you pay, it's a self-service resto btw :)) you need to pay at the counter after eating. :

This is probably one of the best value restaurant anywhere in Singapore, let alone this is in Orchard Road. Some of the items on the menu are about the same prices or even cheaper than some foodcourts in Orchard Road/Marina Centre areas. No wonder it's always crowded, especially during dining hours.Decor is simple, service quite good, portion fair but food taste varies ( depending on the items). Set lunches prices ranges from $6.90-8.90 nett. No additional service charge nor GST. Set is also inclusive of a small bowl of salad & FREE flow of hot & cold beverages. Talk about amazing value! One negative point is that the ventilation here is not good. The strong smell of oil from all the the cooked food is all over the place & stays on your clothes/hair.Which makes one feel like you just walked out of a kitchen- after leaving the place

If you're looking to have a gathering with friends while on a budget, this is a good place. Menu prices are generally less than 10 dollars and although not everything is fantastic, there are pretty tasty dishes like the Black Pepper Chicken Spaghetti, Bacon and Mushroom Risotto, Carbonara, Asari Clam Spaghetti.Skip the dessert and just spend on the mains and sides!

I was introduced to this place by my friend. I was shocked at how cheap the menu was. You could get a pasta for as low as $6.00 crazy. Judging from the atmosphere of the place, was not expecting to be that cheap. So i went back again with my friends with confidence that i could give them a treat, which was great really. We ordered 3 sets of pasta, 1 side and 1 pizza and we also ordered 3 sets of the drink bar. Cost us around only $30+ we couldnt even finish up.So you should try it. Do not expect though above average service, and if you're too picky or your taste isnt for the average italian dish then this place isnt for you.CIAO! ;
