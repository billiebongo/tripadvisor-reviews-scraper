Great little spot hidden in a working part of Singapore. Coffee almost as good as Melbourne's best and a great brekky menu
4
The coffee here was very good. Staff were friendly. Service was prompt. I would recommend stopping in if passing by.

Good friendly service have baby chair as well. Nice smoked salmon and bagel. Come and visit again. Many European guest.

Came here today to try the coffee, having noticed it a few times when visiting the area before. I was quite happy with the cappuccino, although it could have been a little warmer. Didn't try the food.

Had the scrambled eggs with guacamole and pumpkin seeds, very tasty combination and the quality of ingredients TOP notch. Great sitting out the front üëç

Our first morning in Singapore found us up early watching to explore. We found this perfect place not to far from our hotel. The Bravery cafe! We were greeted by friendly staff, with an easy menu and a great seating area. The coffee was superb (The same allpress coffee as my local at home) as was the food. I had poached eggs, mushrooms and avo half on toast. It‚Äôs exactly like anything you‚Äôd find in a westerner suburb. You won‚Äôt be disappointed!

I came this area a few times and most of the popular cafes are just overcrowded and it's very stressful to enjoy your meal! After reviewing online, I was also hesitant to come here but am glad that I didn't make the wrong choice.It was slightly crowded when I arrived at 1pm, but oh well, it's a known cafe so it's normal to be crowded at lunch time. After staying put until 5pm, the crowd subsided and you'll find it nice to be reading or working here. Power plugs are available but not many can be found. Love the recommended steak too! Also, some said that service was bad but personally, I felt that it could be due to the large crowds. When the crowd subsided, I received very good service from the team. Great cafe to keep in my list of to-go :

Had lunch here with my colleagues and I can say the cafe is very nice. Food and coffee was good. Ordered the teriyaki beef bowl and I really loved it. Coffee was good as well. The only downside is that we had to wait quite Long considering there are not many customers around.
5
Simple an delicious food that is not overly seasoned or priced. I find dinning in Singapore is so over-rated- but finally I found a place that I look forward to go every weekend for brunch and the coffee is very good too. The guac & egg- is so so yummy. They know how to make their scramble eggs. Prime beef Burgers and seabass with lemon sauce is also my favourite. The staffs are friendly and have kind faces :) Btw- it‚Äôs an open kitchen too!

The good thing about the cafe is, it opens earlier than most others around it. We had eggs on toast with bacon, mushroom and avocado, ice chocolate and truffle fries. 1. The eggs on toast set was okay. Eggs were perfectly done, mushroom was flavourful, avocado was awesome. 2. Truffle fries was a bit disappointing. The fries was crispy (which was nice), but it was a bit salty (good if you like salty fries) and without truffle aroma. 3. The ice chocolate was made from chocolate fudge and milk. So it was without the aroma of chocolate.It was acceptable. If you are early around there and have no other choice, you can give it a try.
4
Found this on my last day in Singapore and really liked it. Nice range of breakfasts available and good coffee. I would have come more if I had found it before.
5
I come here almost every month, especially when I need to unwind. I LOVE the coffee here. They're special is the Lavender latte and their food selection is pretty decent. Decor is very "raw" and artistic.
Love the vibe!
3
Shared tables and wooden benches in a small cafe with good latte, including an unusual lavender latte, and an interesting selection of desserts.
We tried the chocolate salted caramel tart and the delectable fluffy banana pancakes.
3
Good coffee, polite staffs. Food is decent but ultimately not very special. You could be unsure of the place but once you see a huge mural wall it's at your left, push the door in. I'm not entirely sure but the concept could possibly be of great coffee, great food fuss free place; however if the cafe (and the exhaust system) is given is an upgrade it would definitely be much better. Then again if you're coffee anonymous you could probably stick around the outdoor seating almost all day cus p/s there's wifi.
2
Having friends gathering here. Ordered SAM salad and it's disappointing :(. 3 slices of salmon with greens, a bit of avocado slices, green bean. Salad dressing is minimal, I asked for extra. My friend ordered salmon sandwich and it's terrible (see photos), like only half!French fries is so so ... Overall, there's really nothing special that makes me want to come back.
3
Came here for Saturday breakfast. For food, we got the pancake stack and the bagel set. The pancake stack was decent. Nice and thick yet well cooked. Topped with slices of a banana and some strawberries. Comes with a generous serving of maple syrup on the side. The bagel set however was a tad disappointing. The bagel was over toasted and hence it felt like we're eating a piece of rock. Cream cheese served together with the bagel wasn't creamy, instead was like crumbly pieces of cheese. Salad served wasn't salad as it had no dressing. Slices of salmon was not bad. The only good thing about the bagel set was the scrambled eggs, which were quite good. Really disappointed by the bagel set given the price. On the other hand, drinks were quite good. I hand the cold slow brew black whereas the missus had the lavender latte. The cold brew was strong while the latte was aromatic and fresh.Do give this nice rustic cafe a try...... I mean only try the drinks if you don't wish to be disappointed.

This caf√© is so close to Hotel Snow at Cavan st.It has a nice breakfast menu and the staff are friendly. It is quiet and nice inside. Has very minimal d√©cor and plays soft music in the background.The location itself is great! Worth recommending
5
Couldn't use the Wi-Fi in my hotel room (long story!) so worked from this cafe one day. Wi-Fi connection excellent, coffee delicious, and the beats are nice and chilled. Wonderfully decorated and a great atmosphere along with friendly staff. They also have a fine selection of high-end magazines, such as The Gentlewoman
3
I tried the pancakes as recommended by several food blogs. They were nice but not excellent.Coffee and art were good.Staff was friendly.Prices cheaper than most cafes in the neighbourhood.However the ventilation needs improvement. I smelled of the kitchen for the whole day at work
5
We spent a lazy Sunday morning here, our kids at the stools watching out the window and playing video games while my husband & I sat at the epic picnic table. Drinks were all delicious & reasonably priced. Seriously amazing hot chocolate - brownie batter in sweet milk with beautiful froth. Staff are really nice and ambiance is great. Menu looked good but we weren't hungry
2
A bit disappointed, the service was too long. And my sandwich was not complete : the ricotta was missing.
However, the place is nice for a brunch.
3
Large choice of food. The dishes are sophisticated which is perfect for a brunch but the service is very slow and it took more than 45 mn for just a sandwich.
2
Unique decor and set up, but that didn't distract me from the fact that it's overpriced and noisy...
4
Awesome coffee (beans from Melbourne) & brekky that was fresh & tasty! Simple but funky interior, definitely worth seeking out.
5
Hands down the best breakfast and lunch cafe in Singapore. Quality ingredients, great service at the right price. Weekends wouldn't be the same without a bravery burger :)
4
food very good. always been our sunday brunch. standard of food never fails. service standard is always there. you can choose to have air-con or alfresco seats.
4
A really open, airy space. Good brunch options. I really loved my eggs and guacamole dish, and my husband had a salmon dish. They were simple and tasty. Their coffee was great. I really liked the industrial feel of the space. It wasn't obviously marked outside, so we weren't sure if we had the right place.
2
Checked out this place for breakfast. Good coffee, quality jams as they are from berry farm in Perth. The quality of the breakfast is mediocre the pancake crumbed when cut and the worst part of the place is the ventilation. My husband has a sensitive nose and throughout breakfast he was sneezing all the way. Not a great place for those with sensitive nose. We can smell the cooking as it is an open kitchen.

The Bravery Cafe doesn't really have a sign board so it may be easy to miss, so do keep your eyes peeled out for it. The ambiance is relaxed and casual. Their menu's pretty good too. We had Eggs on Toast, their Black Bean burger (with tomatoes, baby spinach, aged cheddar, eggs, and a side of Truffle Potato Chips), a stack of Pancakes, Iced Coffee, & the Lavender Latte.The burgers were spicy & delicious, the Latte was unusual but delicious - fragrant and aromatic. The food and coffee were really good, definitely worth going back for. The only feedback would be to up the quantity of pancake topping - there was barely any Ricotta and the banana was more garnish than part of the dish
5
This cafe serves really decent food and coffee at a decent price.The decor is basic and modern, probably a hit with the younger generations. I found the food to be really nicely prepared, everything was fresh and tasty.First time I have ever raved about the toast, the bread was really tasty. Being picky about my coffee I found this to be one of the best I drank in Singapore.Recommended. My only complaint, I wish you opened at 7AM
4
Nearest MRT station will be the Lavender Station. Approximately 5 mins walking distance from the V Hotel / Lavender Station. A cozy cafe without much decoration. They serve the special latte, Lavender Latte.
4
Artic-star's review is spot on. The exterior is very non-descript. Food was great and service was very friendly. Great for breakfast or brunch. We'll be back.

This cute cafe is trying to be trendy with its 'handmade' tables and warehouse look decor. However during peak times on weekends the small kitchen struggles keep up with the number of seats. In other words, the kitchen is too small for the number of customers ordering. Inside also gets quite noisy, too noisy to enjoy a chat over brunch. The food, once it arrives is very good. So if you have time to spare, this cafe is worth checking out.
2
At the beginning...it was a nice place, but the last time we went there, we waited too much like more than 45 minutes, the food was so so, my friend did not have avocado - did not why because other clients ordered the same plate and had avocados .... Overpriced for the food
3
Went here for brunch around 1pm on a Saturday. They have an 'kitchen table style' seating area with a few separate seats (including outdoors). I ordered 'raunchy eggs, sunny side up' and orange juice.Got seated and the orange juice arrived within a couple of minutes. It came in a small glass and I was surprised with the quantity. Even upmarket expensive restaurants give twice the size for the same price. Anyway, so I kept it on the side and waited for the eggs. It took me nearly 35-40 minutes to get served. Meanwhile the two girls sitting on my right got tired of waiting and left by just paying for the coffee. Even the couple to my left exclaimed 'finally' when their order arrived. I guess I wasn't the only one. The kitchen is small and does not have the capacity to service too many guests at a time. Tip: Either hire more staff for the kitchen or take fewer guests !The eggs themselves were quite good. The beans that came with them were good too. But the overall experience was average. This is definitely not the place for a quick bite

Over the last one year, too many cafes have open at the Jalan Besah and Lavendar area. Bravery Cafe is one of the latest kid on the block. They serve very decent sandwiches and pasta if you wish to drop by for lunch. Coffee is reasonably priced and they are decent

Was sunday driving aimlessly, when I spotted an unusual looking establishment with no sign boards or any indication of the type of business it is running. Curiosity turned on like lighthouse lights with target on sight. Entered I did. If you had to describe "laid back" accurately, this would be it. High ceilings, big tables. Very spacious and relaxing - it looked like a workshop to cut wood. I ordered a long Machiatto, which a lot of baristas in singapore have trouble with - but not this one. Coffee beans form melbourne and I think the barista too. The music played was too fast but I think this is the trend unfortunately now from melbourne to singapore. Not bad all in all. I would go again for sure

Really like this place, it's big, spacious and the staff were really happy and easy going. The menu is simple, love the titles. I ordered Raunchy Eggs, with Gluten Free bread. It was ok, but the anchovies in the baked beans tasted more like strong shrimp paste than lovely fragrant anchovies! What out for that!!! The staff were brilliant though, they went out of their way to help me get what I needed. Nice to see cafe offer Gluten free bread! Great place if you want to go do some work and have some nice food. I'll go back again, I'm sure.

For full reviews, visit my blog at ms-skinnyfatWatch out Tiong Bahru, Jalan Besar is the up and coming cafe area with its current mix of Chye Seng Huat Hardware, Windowsill by the Woods and also The Bravery Cafe. Brunch called for a trip to The Bravery at Horne Road and i was hopeful that it'd be as good as The Plain and Ronin as it's opened by the same folks.Typical sign-less cafe but this time i even had a hard time finding the door! As for the decor, well it's one thing to be minimalist, another to be 'can't be bothered' and this seems to fall into the latter category.Unfinished wooden planks on DIY metal frames and concrete slabs make uncomfortable tables and chairs that are also potentially hazardous and the electrician obviously wasn't paid to do his job with the lights. Tables are wooden planks on top of simple metal frames and concrete slabs. The general environment felt make-shift and the noise level was deafening despite the 60% capacity when i visited. Not quite a place to hang around for long.Coffee is made using the same Genovese blend from Brazil, which is robust but not acidic. The Lavender latte ($5.50) had a fragrant aroma and was lightly sweetened but there's a light bitter aftertaste that wasn't present in the flat white. Perhaps that came from the dried lavender.Great Flat White ($4.50) with superb crema. Drinks like a dream.The food menu is rather limited, as with the usual The Plain and Ronin style but the regular eggs on toast, pancakes and some savory mains and sandwiches were available.The Brave Begedil ($17) was a Bravery recommendation. Poached eggs with Turkey Bacon (wert no real bacon?!!) and Avocado on Corned Beef Begedil Hash. If you don't know what Begedil is, it's a Malay potato patty with onions and coriander. I was looking forward to digging in and that was when i noticed my missing avocado. And it was only after i asked about it was i told that they ran out of avocado and the replaced it randomly with another slice of turkey bacon. Seriously?! So you weren't gonna tell me if i didn't ask? Never not cross a hungry woman. NEVER. Oh the same thing happened to the customer next table too.It was a further slap in the face with the overdone poached eggs and papery whites. Nothing in this dish stood out and the bacon was terribly dry and sweet. I should have ordered the Beef Steak Ciabatta ($13.50) which had good reviews on the juicy rump steak silvers or that Ricotta Cheese Pancakes.Spotty service was yet again displayed with our second order. We ordered the Crostini ($7.50) shortly after the Begedil and it was only served when we were way done with the first dish. I think i spent a good 10 mins playing with the leftovers and the crostini still didn't come.Well at least it was a huge portion when it finally came. Well sauteed Aubergine (aka Eggplant aka Brinjal aka that mushy plant) cooked with Chickpeas, served on on Sourdough Toast with Mint Leaves and Crumbled Feta Cheese. This Vegetarian Greek breakfast is a departure from my regular brunch items but i found it rather refreshing with the sharp kick from the feta.Would i go back to The Bravery again? The answer is no. Especially not when there are so many cafes popping up in the hood. If you want a better brunch, head on to Ronin (read review here), which does the best brunch out of their 3 outlets

The Bravery has a very nondescript exterior, in fact the panes metal and reflective glass doors made it deceptive - one wouldnt know it was a cafe if not for the tables outside; and looking for the "door" was another challenge. No, I never knew its existence if not for my friend *Celine suggesting it.Interior-wise, a very "hipsteristic" and relaxing ambience of non-fussy wooden tables, simple chairs and a fully function bar counter filled with bustling baristas hard at work. Music was blasting and we took a seat in the rustic cafe with their cement floors, and bare furnishings. The highlight in decor was probably this ornamental horse situated right smack in the middle of the cafe.It was not hard for us to make our selection and place order with the friendly staff here. I knew I had to have the Lavendar Latte that was their signature - imagine sweet milky froth that comes with a strong flavor of Lavendar. The only catch was having to chew on the tiny little lavendar seedlings that we give credit to, for the strong aroma. The marriage of lavendar and milky-coffee was surprisingly good, even blissful.Hungry little me was prepared to wait 30 minutes to 45 minutes for my food, which the staff had informed beforehand. But they exceeded expectation (for waiting time) by alot, since my food came within 15 minutes, and I took the recommendation by the waitress - Raunchy Eggs - two fried eggs with spicy beans with anchovies, Parmesan with shredded cabbage on tortilla. I added crispy fried bacon that I believe was responsible for the dish being extra tasty. The eggs would've been lovelier if the edges were brown, the way I like it. But nonetheless, it was a nutritious and tasty treat especially eaten with the shredded cabbages, cheese and thin slice of tortilla at the bottom. What a hearty brunch.For more detailed information and photos, please visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/04/brunch-at-bravery-cafe.htm
