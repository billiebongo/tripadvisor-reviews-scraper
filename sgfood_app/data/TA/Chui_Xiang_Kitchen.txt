After a year of absence, Chui Xiang Kitchen is now located at the restaurant row on Casuarina Road (off Upper Thomson Road, near the Upper Peirce Reservoire turn-off). The standard is still great and service with a smile as before.My favourite dishes: Drunken Prawn served in a claypot, Marmite pork ribs and golden mushroom on tofu. Prices still very reasonable, always a pleasure to dine here
