Love the ambience, not forgetting the freshly brewed beer. Staff was friendly and welcoming as well.

Roasted pork belly and sausage platter was so so
Laksa cream pasta and teriyaki chicken pizza were better than expected
Limited children cutlery
They charge for water

Ordered pasta and My Favourites combo that came with fiery wings, fries and 2 big sausages. These were served hot, thumbs up!

Pork Knackle was soldout on that day which was a little disappointing. But the beers, service and atmosphere were still great.

Had a Sunday dinner at Starker with my family and everyone enjoyed the food. It was hearty bar food that’s good and affordable, we had pizza, chicken wing and roasted pork

Poor service and noisy atmosphere. Very disappointed for family Christmas dinner. We will never come back again.

The place is nice and quiet. I am impressed by the staff. They kept changing our beer mug to the cold ones when our mugs warmed up. Very good service. My friend and I enjoyed the beer very much!

Had great food at the Hillview branch and place while crowded, but wasnt as noisy as compared to other places Iâ€™ve been to. Kudos to staff like Aylssa who gave great service and attention to my table. Place is a lil cramped though, I had my stroller and it was quite a squeeze to fit it to our table where I had my infant. But overall i loved the place

Packed on a friday night. Do arrive early to order their signature pork knuckles as they get sold out quickly. Pork belly was very good! Margarita pizza and wagyu burger was nice too. For sides, do try the Calamari and nachos. Would recommend their dunkel / lychee craft beers

Totally bad customer service at Starker HillV2. Ordered a barrel of 2L beer at the outlet and your staff (might be the supervisor) insisted that i have to use pint/beer glass to drink my beer when I requested to use smaller glass. Why can't i choose how i want to drink my beer and your staff has to dictate and decide for me? I did not order 1 pint and asking him to split into few smaller glasses. I merely requested to use smaller glasses to drink from the barrel. Wasted 5 minutes reasoning with your staff before he agreed reluctantly to serve us in smaller glasses. Absolutely clueless about customer service

Food is good. The service is good and fast responsing to request. Recommended for both personal or business.

Little people, good for catch-up. But one of the staffs is quite blur. We ordered a cake (to serve after meal) that meant to be a birthday surprise but he came over to ask if he should serve it. =/

Food is above average.
The signature there are their beer. We tried the lychee beer. Have a light fruity taste. Restaurant is cosy and easy accessible by public transport
4
Should do more tutorial s for waiters. Male waiters act like models. Explanations about the beer kinds was very poor
But overall nice place to be.
Spare ribs had sauce from a bottle that should change
4
a nice place to chill, grab some decent beer and grub, and watch some football. able to host large groups, and a good place to just while away.
4
Pork knuckle is crispy and tender. Good variety of food and beer. Good place for all occasions. Will be back.

Service is awesome. Staff have been very attentive and food is great.We have a great evening at Starker.

Birthday celebration for 3 family members. Food was served quickly; good service. Food was pretty decent too. Just that table for 12 was pretty cramped.

Cosy bar with adequate bites while you down German beers and wine. Cosy and not very noisy, so you can hold decent conversation with your companions. Can get chilly in the evening, especially after a downpour, and with the breeze from the overhead aircons.Food is ok (portions may be smaller), and the small pizzas are great for sharing with friends (you can order a few versions). Family friendly, and kids are welcomed. Wide variety of food and drinks. No boisterious crowd. Good for family, friends and business crowd
5
Once you're on micro-brewed, you do want to go back to manufactured draft like Tiger or Heineken. It's just not the same anymore. The small bites are another draw - fried onions, calamari and spicy wings (you can asked for more spice!). They used to do friend shrimp but for some reason, have taken it off the menu. Looking forward to TGI

Love the fresh beer here! Food selection is good too. And great service and ambience. Will be back for more!
Warning to drivers, the carpark is small and always crowded. You need to have some luck to get a parking lot!

Headed there on a Wednesday. Crowd was okay, we had a round table which was cosy. Ordered vongole, ribeye steak, carbonara and creme brulee. All of them were fantastic! Staff were attentive as well, will definitely head back!

The food are great and served fast. The staff are very friendly and attentive especially we have kids with us.

Location is a little far off but very nice atmosphere for a quiet drink - generally good selections!
5
Good beer good food good people! There was even live telecast of the champion cup. Not too rowdy for a pub!

Went there for light lunch. Good food and service. Beer was good and the place was not too crowded out.
Worth a visit. Parking ample

Nice cosy place. Ok for family. One place where you get ice cold beer; really the glass had some ice sticking on it. I had the Lager and aromatic. Both were not great. Maybe the dunkel will be a better choice. The lamb shank was exceptionally good. The burgers were alright. But the sausages were bland and unappetising. The service is worth mentioning. The staff were very attentive.

We visited StÃ¤rker Bistro recently and it was basically an eat and go experience. The table was too small for a party of four. We were unable to order the quantity of food and drinks for all of us and were trying not to knock the drinks off the table. The garlic toasts and spicy chicken wings were tasty, pepperoni pizza surprisingly small and fish and chips were ok.
4
It was not disappointing to have our dinner in Starker being our first time. The food was great and the service was very good. We didn't realize they do the extra mile to change our beer glass so that the beer is kept cold. Very nice and thoughtful service staff.

Reserved a table here for my family - I couldn't attend family lunch that day; these are their pictures. But they said the food was delicious & also there was barely anyone on a Sunday afternoon - nice & quiet to chat. There also is beer... So there are many reasons why I should head down to check this place out. Accepts reservations - I used Chop
