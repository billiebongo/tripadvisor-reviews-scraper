this is my perfect type of late night place. deep flavours, cheap prices.
walked here every night from my Airbnb in Lavender during my 4 night stay last year. i cant wait to go back!

You will sure love this stall selling curry rice just exactly like economy rice, but they give everything good portion, generous with the sauces too!
Main stall is at Jalan Besar, new one is at upper thomson
4
If you look for exciting food, this is a place to be. Open for extended hours, you get all sorts of local food plus their speciality of scissor cut curry-rice all the day long.
4
But this is an exception! The mix of spices was really good and right now, my mouth is longing for that flavor. If you are near Little India or Farrer Park, you should really try their curry.
5
We always queue up when the shop opens- that's when the food comes out fresh. Though the prize is getting more expensive year by year, but the taste still remains. The curry is simply delectable !
2
Food is tasteless and costly..gone were the good old days where it was really aromatic and tasty. Won't patronise again.

If you loved curry rice, you shouldn't miss this place. Location: easy to find, just google, by main road (Jalan besar)Atmosphere : humble shop, classic "kopitiam". No air-con, yet it is how the local enjoy their daily meal. What to eat: economic rice or rice with variety of dish with curry. You are free to choose what you to eat, and the shop owner will cut the dishes with scissors for you. What I like : the curry sauce and the dish are well cook. Price : acceptable, you can settle a meal around SGD 7. I have chili small sardines (ikan bilis), loh bak (local meat roll), and dark souce marinated pork meat. And a glass of cold lemonade.This is the place for supper, every time I want to eat Curry

They sell a lot of yummy fried stuffs, and you will eat this with rice and curry sauce. Simple but delish! It won't tear off your wallet too. If you are a big eater and only can feel full by eating rice, this place are great to satisfy your tummy.

The pork chop is soggy and the kong bak gravy is too starchy. The food is cold and it was just about 12.15pm. The curry just doesn't taste like what I expected it to be.For the price I paid for 2 person I would have better spend it at City Square Mall
4
The shop was located near my hostel and it's always pack so I decided to give it a try. The curry was amazing as it is not very spicy but still flavourful. The price depends on the type of dishes you choose but it's definitely value for money
5
The rice and curry are awesome,we have to choose the addons on our choices, rates are also reasonable,
1
I heard this is very famous in Singapore so i decided to try it. It's over rated and not that tasty. The gravy is too sticky and doesn't have strong curry taste too. Not recommended.
4
Closest eating place to Aqueen. It's right across the road. Food is good, especially for those with Asian taste
4
Despite food quality dipping, this stall is still one of the best curry rice stalls in Singapore, the pork chop and cabbage is a must try. Rest of the dishes are mostly above average. Don't expect your plate of curry rice to be cheap though.
5
I rarely have rice for my meal, but I did try their curry rice for 3 times already. Nice taste, very different from the other curry rice that I had before.
5
Fabulous food - the queue lined up along the footpath speaks for itself. The dofu wraps especially good.
4
My friend recommended us this curt rice stalk and we came as group so we can ordered more variety.The rice can mixed with biased gravy and curry gravy which is our favourite mixture.Reasonable price with delicious comfort food as dinner.Non- aircon so don't expect much other than the food
4
Ate here three times at my boyfriend's insistence. If you don't like your rice drenched in curry, you can ask for the black sauce only. Found it surprisingly nice and affordable. Pork belly was good. Only agreed to eat here after I saw some ladies and tourists here as well and because it's near our hostel
2
Had so many reviews that pointed to this direction for Curry Rice. Not impressed though. Pork belly was not braised though, most of the other fried dishes were already soggy and the famous curry was just curry flavoured starch sauce. An edible meal, but not worth the rating. Oh yeah, you have to deal with staff there that think they are giving food away for free
5
So far when i travel to Singapore this is the best curry i ever had. The flavour is mixed from 2 different spices that combined into something really delicious and tempting, other than that the service was very quick and precise although they can control their action well and made a minimum mess. as for the price it self, it's very cheap the you can eat a whole plate with 2 meat just for 2 dollars only, depending on the meat also though, and the variation is so many. Everyone should try this restaurant when the go to Singapore it open from 23.00 - 03.00 AM, it just a little walk from farrer park mall exit towards the Bugis area, if you're lost your way try asking the people direction to Jalan Besar, because it's on the side of the road

Brought my cousins from abroad and they loved it. Inexpensive and tasty. Worth going again despite being a little bit out of the way!
3
The Hotel does not offer a Fine Dining experience. It is a value for money hotel with limited and cheap dishes. It stays open in till 1 am or even beyond that. It is mostly crowded.
5
This is a favorite of locals it seems and the food is quite delicious. You will have to queue up during rush hours for service as there are lot of people having dinner or lunch
1
Never eaten such badly presented and prepared food, the curry that the server piled on top gives it a very disgusting look. Too much curry makes the rice swims in the curry and the taste of the curry is bland.
4
A typical local eatery with plastic plates, a line leading to a food stall where you order what you fancy ...to put under a large splash of delicious curried sauce . The whole plate is frankly not of the highest aesthetic quality, but the taste is unique and delicious.Open late at night
4
I love it! Whenever I am around the area, this is a must. Not sure if this dish will appeal to foreigners especially westerners, but if you are adventurous, get the full works of pork with fats, curry chicken, egg, cabbage, served on white rice and doused in gravy and curry sauce. The owners have been doing this since the 60s when they serve this to Malaysian truck drivers on their runs to Beach Road according to my father. The coffee shop and its surrounding may not be aesthetically appealing, get your fill and off you go. Burp

It was quiet hard to find this restaurant for because it located quiet fat from the MRT. The looks maybe quiet messy but the taste is nice, the combination of curry was tasty. They have some variety of foods that you can mix up and you pay according to the food you order. The service just ok ok like normal typical singaporean chinese restaurant that not really friendly to the customer
2
This is a well known place and use to serve good food at affordable prices. However, at my last trip to this place, I was surprised how expensive this place has become (relative to the shrinking the portions they are now serving). The curry isn't spicy and there was nothing outstanding about this place. SInce it is near the road, it is also quite noisy
4
Honestly, standard dropped tremendously over the years if you have been following the real stall since young. And with everybody starting to add a pair of scissors on their curry rice, you start to get warped. Nevertheless, to be honest, none of them tasted as good as the one and only before at Kitchener Rd.The saving grace however,is the curry,which still remains good
4
Ok, so I'm not a sophisticated foody/ metrosexual but this was a) tasty b) value, $3 for 3 different items on rice c) no frills roadside experience dining with the locals. Plus the constant sound of the head 'chef' swissing his scissors was good to watch. Enjoyed
5
must try the pork chop, pork belly and the chicken wings.... but must be careful if u come there on lunch/dinner time you must make a line to get the food....
the price is very cheap, just about $2 - $10
2
The curry was not spicy. In the end, what we had was just rice with curry gravy and some vegetable. To us, there was nothing special or yummy about this.
4
The pork cutlet and curry rice is excellent. Very authentic place! Highly recommend.

I love their curry.

I go to Scissor Cut about once every two weeks. When it is late and everything else is shutting down, very likely Scissor Cut is still open. They offer an assortments of meats/veggies and allow you to pick what you want and price accordingly. The first time can be confusing so keep the following in mind: The menu is on the wall on the left, you will pay for rice plus whatever items you indicate to the man with the scissors. Usually they will add the curry on top, however you can always ask for the curry on the side. If you ask for it to go, they will wrap it in paper and a rubber band... a bit messy to eat but manageable. Quality is relatively consistent... taste is always delicious (a cheap fast food delicious), some days more than others. The seating area is relatively clean but outdoors and very basic (think stools and plastic tables)

Snipped meat & veg & a couple of different curry sauces over rice for S$2.50. What more do you want?? If you're on a budget, this place is great. If you're expecting something over the top you'll be disappointed - maybe this is the reason for the negative reviews... For me, it was great
2
i have always seen long queues and heard amazing comments about the curry rice and was dying to try it. However the first try was disappointing. The taste is pretty much normal, nothing to wow about. I do not particularly enjoy the "sticky" texture of the curry - feels as if too much corn flour has been added into it. Well maybe this is the special feature about it but yeah, it's an acquired taste i must say. Having tried Malay/Indian/Japanese or even chinese home cooked curry... i would put scissor cut's at the bottom of my list.

the best food I have tasted. Singapore. I love the glutenous rice served with a variety of meets and vegetables. one place I never fail to visit every time I am in Singapore. this is street food at its best. this however may not be every-ones dish
4
I always try to flock to where the locals eat for the best food around. Scissor Cut near Lavender station is open for lunch, dinner and late night, and totally packed with a winding line at all times. The food is nothing fancy, but totally delicious. And for less than $5, makes for a perfect casual meal! My boyfriend couldn't get enough of it when we were in SIngapore
3
Tried this once, it being located just behind my current house - but never thought of coming back there again. The food is supposed to be amazing but really there is nothing special about it. It was actually pretty oily and we did not even finish it! Just don't fall for the long Q - it really doesn't mean it's amazing
