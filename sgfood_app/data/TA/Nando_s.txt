We had a great time at nandos ... and was amazed by the quality and the taste of the dishes we ordered!! Hands down the best chicken I’ve ever had ..
5
It was very nice ambience with colorful yet spicy fiery sauce peri peri..we had full chicken platter with garlic bread..
Must try if ur spicy lover..
5
I fall in love their sauces, they have it hot, mild and garlic option. And i love them all. The chicken grill is delicious. I also picked something from rice menu with paprika and union in it (sorry guys forget the name), and it’s up to my taste bud. And good thing is, this resto is a good option for those whose looking halal food

My wife and I stopped by for lunch and we had two very different food experiences. She ordered the 1/4 Chicken and fries, it was juicy and tasty. I ordered the Chicken Breast Burger and is was overcooked and dry, it was like eating cardboard. During the entire meal we saw our waiter only thrice, once to take order, second time to "serve" the food and then to bring the bill. All three times it seemed like it was a big effort on his part,we could definitely have done without the attitud

I've called to make reservation since there will be 10 people but when I went there my reservation was not register. Luckily we came early before the peak period start. Nevertheless the good waitress forget about my disappointment. Food was good and the portion were generous. Overall good food and good place to bond over meal.
2
So food takes forever to come out, but at least it’s good. Price is good too. Service sucks waitress wouldn’t even get me water then when I went to the bar the other waitress told me she would serve it in a shocked way. So is it self-service or not

Arrived at Nandos and having been to many around the world was expecting to be seated upon arrival, as the big sign at the entrance said. But no...had to call out to one of the 5 waiters wandering around and was eventually pointed to a table. No paper towels by the sink to wash your hands and after placing my drinks order had to go in search of a glass, despite the same 5 waiters wandering around aimlessly...very poor!
4
We went there for late lunch. Ordered 2 set meals and waiter was very familiar with items in the menu. He told us appx how many minutes to get the food but it came earlier than he said. When we asked for the sauce, the waiter was willing enough to explain about the sauce and happy to provide as many types of sauce as we asked. Worth paying the price
4
i had the espetada carnival with mediterranean rice. i went with 3 other friends, we had to follow up after we've talked about so many things already. my chicken was soooo good!!! i could eat it everyday. juicy chicken and the feta cheese was so perfect with it. even the bell peppers were juicy. i think the rice portion is quite small though and i do wish they have plain rice

Terrible service from Nando's @Plaza Singapura. Service Staff asked us to find a place to sit ourselves and did not even give us the menu. We had to find and take the menu ourselves. Moreover, the food served was delayed.
5
Halal certified, for those of you who need to know.
The service is pretty good, and waiting time for food to arrive even in peak hours is commendably short.
Nice ambience, and service staff are friendly and obliging.
5
Very good service and food. Average priced. We enjoyed our both visits here and will recommend this place for a quick meal.
4
This particular Nando's has some of the nicest wait staff in Singapore. Everyone was friendly and attentive, and the free refills of soft drink was cool too. The menu is mostly the same as Nando's around the world, with only minor differences. Very much recommend!
4
Wanna something hot and spicy to add on to your chicken, there are a few flavors to choose from and enjoy the dine in.
4
A different taste of chicken. Reasonable price and nice staff. Had a good meal here. Definitely come back. Have a draw paper and color pencil for kid. Nice.
5
We had a dinner at Nandos, it was very crowded and long que but they are well organized in everything. I was expecting to wait sometime for my food but surprisingly it was served fast. The food is delicious as always, chicken is finger licking good. Staff is very attentive and helpful. Thumbs up to Nandos. 
4
It's great to have home comforts away from home and Nandos does that for our family. Good service and great food. The chicken tenders, spicy rice, corn on the cob, pita and wraps are all fantastic. The lemon and herb flavor is good, for a little more heat go for mild. The hot is really hot and is appropriate for the seasoned hot food eater. Love Nandos...
4
the food was great and the staff very friendly! There are a few differences than Nandos in the UK. There is waiteress service, no ordering food at the till! Also when asking for Fanta, you might get a surprise, in Singapore it is grape flavour and not Orange as in the UK. Overall great stuff, who can complain about great Chicken
3
Extremely noisy place (even without the rather loud music in the background) so not great for a relaxing meal. Waitress got our order wrong although she did ask an extra time so in the end only one of two got food. It was quickly corrected by other staff though. Loved the food as always although it was different from what I normally have at Nandos in other countries
4
We ordered quarter chicken and strip pita. I like the chicken marinated with herbal lemon. Service is pretty fast. Chicken tasted good.
4
The restaurant is located in the mall. They serve chicken in different styles and you can select the level of chilli. Plenty of seating space. Good courteous service.
4
First time to the place. Overall price are ok. Food can be spicy or non spicy depending on your choice. Service was good till the billing where they forget my bill and have to spend some time waiting there for my bill. Will visit again.
5
Everything was perfect at Nando's from the amazingly delicious food down to the staff, i have heard raves about it and wamted to try it out, and it didnt disappoint.
4
Had the honor of being served by Jasmine. Super friendly and Super outgoing! Kudos to her! Food was alright, similar to that of other outlets we've been to but service was outstanding")
4
I quite like the burger however the sauce has made the bread abit soggy. I like the peri-wedges. Staff is quite friendly.
2
After hearing about this place from several people, we decided to give it a try. The service in Singapore is always something that is a issue, and needs to be addressed as a whole entity. However this place was likely the worse we have seen. The staff truly ignored your request and would pass right by you. We had to get up to get our own sauce and tomato sauce as waiting for them to bring it after requesting was obviously not going to happen. The drinks are bottomless refills but what's the point if you can not get a refill? Now on to the food. I had the chicken burger and wedges. The bun was Hugh but that is all that was. The inside consisted of a few pieces of lettuce and two small thin pieces of chicken. Upon eating the burger the chicken was tough and hard to chew, as if was not fresh at all. The side that was grilled? If that is even true was so tough I had to tear off making my chicken even smaller. Yes I am American and yes we are use to big portions however being in Singapore for 4 years I am using only my knowledge and portion size based on what I have experienced in SG. The wedges we a regular size, and had some type of spicy seasoning on them. There were three of us with three different meals and no one was impressed nor felt they would resist the establishment. Overall experience? Bad service. Food not worth having again! Sorry Nando's we will not be seeing you again...
2
Everytime I come here I do wonder why I do so. Service is always slow and inconsistent. No matter how many times you say things like chicken without skin it still comes with the skin on and the drinks always take an age for some unknown reason. Could seriously be improved
5
Portuguese style flame grilling, East African chillie, South African invention. I guess the Chicken comes from Malaysia maybe :-) Wide variety of flavors and styles to choose from. My favorite is the mild marinade. I always ask for extra basting to dip the juicy chicken meat into. Sometimes I add hot sauce when I'm in mood. Gotto be careful :-) 1/4 chicken and two sides usually grill veggies and coleslaw. My standing order for years at this venue. They also have other items on the menu. I notice the espetada is selected often. Personally I don't like my food hanging on a huge skewer. But it seems entry entertaining. Price wise it's not cheap but in my view is well priced. If you download the app and collect chillies per visit then on 3rd visit you can redeem a 1/4 chicken. On 6th visit you earn 1/2 chicken. On 9th visit you get free whole chicken. Basically it's a 20% worth of free food. Love it and redeemed many freebies. Ps: I have friends that like the extra hot versions..

Have been twice to this nandos, first time it was very busy and the service wasn't great, it wasn't bad but just took a bit of a while with all requestsHowever the second time it was a bit quieter and the service was absolutely excellent. Served by Jasmine and she couldn't do enough, as soon as I had finished a drink she was asking if I wanted a refill. Would reccomend this nandos to anyone
5
good service and great taste.kids platter is done well. enjoyed trying various dip sauces.a definite place to check out

Been to Nandos in many countries but this one in Singapore just doesn't have the mild option- we ordered a wrap and grilled chicken both with lemon and herb but they were still vey spicy. Didn't really enjoy it.
5
Love Nando's for a long time ago...
The Chicken Peri-Peri Hot is very nice... Make sense price, good staffs' services & located in the mall.
Recommended!

Craving for chicken- NAndos is the best place with complete spices you like. Good food and pleasant ambiance.
4
I have been to Nandos for 3 times , the taste was always great , very tasty sauce , Good food presentation .The service was always not bad except for only one time they have served my order Spicy also I have asked them not to do so , when I told the staff to exchange it , they took the plate and came back after a while with the same plate only with the flag tag changed no more
3
Family lunch, great chicken. Service was not as good, unfortunately.Place was overcrowded (Chinese new year public holiday, good reason) and staff was not capable of handling the load.All dishes were excellent - the hotter the better...!Price is on the higher range for this type of place, I think..
4
Good drinks such as madeira red. It is a pomegranate flavoured non alcoholic cocktail. The wrap is healthy and quite an ample serving. It's a busy restaurant so expect to wait at least 45 minutes for food. Order everything up front because you won't see your waiter often. Good value for money and awesome food. The decor is also amazing
5
Recommended by a Friend to try out nandos. Very delicious chicken , slightly on the pricer side for a whole platter but good range of Chili sauces to choose from.Chicken were tender and very tasty . The spicy chicken liver with bread was superb too. Highly recommend the chicken live
5
It's got really juicy chicken. It surely could be very crowded, long waits for tables. Not easy to get attention from staff just because they are always busy. But the staff is friendly, polite and efficient.I go there for the chicken and it is always consistent! It's also got a good loyalty program that rewards you well.
4
I must admit, Nando's is on my safe-to-eat-Low-risk-dining list, where I go when i don't feel like experimenting. Having eaten Nando's on multiple continents, I find this place to have equally good food, though I feel the service is quite slow and typically takes quite Long specially for billing. But you can never go wrong with Nando's!
5
Place was cozy. Chicken smells awesome and appetizing. Good food with great company. Service is fast and efficient.
5
Nandos provides a wonderful dining experience in the heart of Singapore's shopping district. They offer many healthy options, the food is delicious, and the service we received was excellent.
3
Recently tried the nandos here in Singapore on our travels of Asia. Service was good however the food wasn't as good as England's nandos., however worth a visit and good selection of mojitos.😊
2
Love nandos , for some reason the nandos at plaza singapura has extremely rude and bad service. I've been to others like the one in bugis and they r great. What a pity, never coming back to the nandos in plaza singapura again !

This is a very popular chain that provides many choices, as long as it's chicken. You can order your chicken at various levels of spicy, and then add very small side dishes and drinks. The chicken itself is quite good, although uninspiring, but the side dishes are mostly starch and rather expensive for their tiny size. Service is not so great either, especially during busy times when people queue outside to enter
4
We came at an off-peak time and got a table immediately. However, I noticed a sign that says one has to queue before you can get a table and I wondered if people really lined up to eat here.My question was answered when the food arrived. We stuck to the basic peri-peri chicken and rice plus their in-house sauces and the meal was indeed very good. The chicken was grilled perfectly, the spices were just right, the service was fast.The restaurant has a nice interior and located in an area of the mall which is not crowded with people so the noise level is okay. This is also one of the few eating spots in the city that provide service water (they also call it 'free' water).There is a self-serve counter for sauces, plates, utensils and napkins so you don't have to flag down a waitress every time you need something. The prices are very reasonable as they have 'combos' for groups.I would not mind lining up to eat here
2
I'm a Nando's fan, food is great, but unfortunately this restaurant in Star Vista is destroying your brand, better close it. Service is the worst I have seen in Asia, went with the family, after waiting 15 min, nobody came to the table, asked for help, they just did not care!, personnel is not trained, they are not happy, no motivated and there is no supervision.... Do not waist your time going ther

Stopped here with the missus one weekday afternoon after walking around Plaza SG looking for someone to eat. The restaurant we planned to go to was closed in the mid-afternoon and the others didn't take our fancy so we tried this joint. Quite a number of staff working but most seem to congregate behind or around the bar area so service wasn't quick considering we were one of only two tables. We ordered the v spicy chicken burger with fries and a spicy paella/spicy rice dish that came in a frying pan type tray with a lid. The burger was loaded with mayo which kinda distracted from the sauce that this place is well known for. The missus didn't find it spicy at all. My rice dish was actually quite agreeable though heavy on sliced carrots which weren't cooked through so some pieces were almost raw. Some would like it that way but I prefer them cooked. That said, the dish was quite nice.What really disappointed was the pot of tea I ordered. I specified breakfast tea with milk and the waiter nodded and went away. When it arrived there was no milk so I asked for it again and was told they don't provide milk, only creamer. That kinda grated as they could have informed me when I ordered. I let that slide but then noticed the container with sugar didn't have any brown sugar sachets. When I asked for that they said they don't provide brown sugar. Now I understand that they specialise in chicken and maybe pots of tea aren't a big thing for them. But, if you're going to have it on the menu then at least provide the essentials with it. It doesn't hurt to have some milk and brown sugar in stock. To the management I would say, save money on your staff costs because you have too many staff that just hang around and chat and instead invest that money in more products like milk and brown sugar. I am a fan of Nando's and have been for 20 years but even I have to say that the Peri Peri Chicken franchise in Thailand is way better in both service and product. It's a shame
4
~a nice business lunch but hold the peri peri sauces! (a too spicy lunch and we'd be dunking drinks rather than discussions)~the espetada skewers are the best on the menu with the range of sauces you can choose from you'll be spoilt for choiceDon't order too much, if you're like me a half chicken is already too much
5
Just used my freebies all at once. Free quarter chicken, free half chicken and free whole chicken. What a feast. Succulent and soft. Multiple hotness of sauces to eat with. Those who don't like hot stuff then take the mild and add to tomatoe sauce. The lemon and herb sauce is not everyone's taste. One visit the chicken livers served was poor quality. The sauce which is the magic of the dish, was oily and the liver tastes too weird. Returned it. Next one was better. If chicken is dry. Return it. This is my policy now. Price is not cheap. Service can't get perfect but at least the food should be perfect. So from my experience I suggest you demand the perfect food. Don't forget to download the app and earn your chillies and free chicken. Check out the picture for this chillies earning.

We came for late lunch after we were seated its so hard to get the attention of the staff to take our orders and to make things exciting everytime we ask for something the staff keep saying no cannot. Its like if you dont like it just go. Her attitude was really bad. Chinese young lady. Skinny abit curl hair. Its like we owe some money to her. Its rediculious. If she dont have a can do attitude she better find another job she doesnt suit in and F&B line. Staff was so rude.

Had lunch at the Serangoon Nex branch on a Saturday. Not sure if the location was not so good, it was rather quiet for a weekend. Plus point was, we were able to sit for long to chit chat.Service was average. The Espertada Rustica (tender marinated chicken thigh) that I ordered was tender and juicy. I like the mild herb taste. There are misses too, the Portuguese egg tarts were a let down

This was my first time eating nandos. I was given a very warm welcome. I ordered an iced chocolate, corn on the cob, fries and rice with chicken. My iced choc was terrible. Just warm water with cocoa and icecubes. Iced choc is supposed to be made by blending icecubes with cocoa poweder. There was ample staff but they stood around on their phones and talked while i waited several minutes for them to remember my drink.The rice was cold and the drink was warm! The chicken was hot and delicious. The rice was also yummy. The chips were fine although the bowl was dirty and had dried sause on it. The corn had some sort of spicey butter on it that i wiped off coz i didn't like it. There was no mention of the butter on the menu. They should ask if you want it beforehand. When i finished my meal my table was cleaned and i paid the bill. Then my money was taken and the lady just took it and started cleaning other tables without telling me my change was coming so i just sat there until someone else gave it to meMixed feelings about this plac

Took our 2 children here, place had dirty dishes on every table, was filthy with nobody dining in there. We assumed it was closed but nope, open for business. Ordered our food, all came separately, around 10 mins apart, with no forth dish. That then came twice around 20 mins later. When the bill came I demanded the service charge was removed, with some resistance this was eventually done, staff looked at us with disgrace as we left, stay well clear of this badly run restaurant!!

Find me a better place than nandos and I will visit it immediately. A place that serves flame grilled chicken which is tender inside and tasty all around. With peri peri sauces and amazing sides. Send me a message and I will give your suggestion a try. Even if it's more expensive I don't mind as I love nandos style chicken and have yet to find a place that can compare. Other places usually have funny tasting chicken. By the way. Plaza Singapura nandos service has improved. However it is just on par with singapore standards which is not high. Accept that you will focus more on enjoying the food. Some times I cannot find a server, and I just go to the bar and get my cooldrink refill or tell them I want my bill. I come there for the food. Out of many many visits the food only let me down once and that was the chips came cold. Then they refried it and shockingly it was tastier. Not healthy so now I enjoy the veggies and sweet potatoe mash with my half chicken skinless and well done as I don't like it too delicate in the centre. Plus their rewards program "Peri-vilege" earns you a chilli each visit and at the third or so you get free quarter and at 6th visit you get free half and at 9th visit you get free whole chicken. And these are large chicken not tiny ones you get elsewhere in SG. So with the rewards program you net 25-33% savings eventually. And thats the sort of innovative chain they are. I sound like a marketer for them. I just love my nandos. Ps: don't forget to message me names of better flame grilled chicken places in Singapore. I will definitely try them. (to msg you have to go to full TA site

Went to this nando's branch for late lunch after work. It was my first time to try nando's as a lot of people i know were raving about it. Upon arriving around past 2 pm, there was still a queue so i was expecting that it must be something. We were seated promptly and then we placed our order. After waiting for 20 minutes or so, our order was still not in sight. The restaurant was filled but most are halfway with their food. After patiently waiting for our plated chicken, the portion of the chicken and side dishes were small. The boneless chicken was dry and was not redeemed by the sauces. It was difficult to find someone to refill our drink and to bill out (there was service charge btw). What we paid for 2 people was not worth it
4
Being to this place twice & feels happy to see Veg options as you cannot find many veg options in other restaurants around in singapore.Love the food here specially their peri peri sauces varieties.Wish if they can come up with few more veg Dishes.The service is also attentive & quick.everyone out their serve with Smile.Will be back soo
5
Visited the restuarant for the first time with a couple of friends on a Thursday night to celebrate a friend's birthday and I was surprised at the superb service provided! Notably, trainee Martin welcomed us very cheerfully and was very helpful in assisting us to make small preparations to surprise a friend. Jasmine was very lovely as well, constantly checking in on us and ensuring that our glasses are constantly topped up! Your outlet's very lucky to have staff as enthusiastic as Jasmine and Martin - keep up the good work guys! The food was definitely up to standard though I would have preferred it if you provided regular chilli sauce for my fries! Again, my friends and I are very pleased with the service provided and I will definitely return! Cheers!

I visited Nando's at Plaza Singapura with a friend for quick lunch back in February 2014. It was on Friday and basically there's no one in the restaurant but us. But if you think that quiet and empty restaurant would mean the waitresses will be there and ready to take our order, you got it so wrong. It took forever for them to take our order and when they do, they didn't seem to pay attention to what we were ordering.Food finally came out 20 minutes later when we started losing our appetite already. The food presentation was ok, mediocre taste, so-so price. In all, I'd say that the hype of Nando's doesn't come to par with the reality we experienced there. In short, will not visit Nando's Plaza Singapura again
2
Nando's is all about their grilled chicken with spicy sauces (peri peri of various spice levels and garlic peri peri). The food is tasty and while the prices are okay (not cheap, but alright) at this branch the service is consistently bad. It takes a while to take your order and your are lucky to get your drink (don't bother with the bottomless sodas since they will never get around to refilling), and you could wait 30-40 minutes for your bill
5
Loved the peri peri chicken at Nandos..although service is slow..but the wait for the great food is worth
4
My wife and I visited Nando's at Plaza Singapura for lunch. We arrived at 11:40am on Sunday and there was no crowd. The place starts to get crowded after 12:00pm with a queue building up outside the restaurant.A Bit of BackgroundNando's is a South African casual dining restaurant serving Portuguese-Mozambique cuisine. It specializes in chicken dishes with either lemon and herb, mango and lime, and medium, hot, extra hot or extra extra hot Peri-Peri marinade (Peri-peri is another name for African's bird's eye chili or red Devil pepper.)MenuNando's has an interesting range of food and interesting choice of non-alcoholic cocktails (like pomegranate with cola). The salads are served with or without chicken pieces. The have a range of appetizers from chicken liver and Portuguese roll to spicy mixed olives. If there are 3 or 4 of you, you could try the 'Altogether Now' which allows you to have a taste of all the appetizers. There is only one soup, wild mushroom chicken soup served with garlic bread.For the main course, their signature dish, peri-peri chicken is marinated for at least 24 hours and then flame-grilled to order. Nando's also serves burgers, pitas and wraps.Our ExperienceThe service was great. They told us the waiting time is about 20 minutes but we got our meals a lot than that.For our appetizer or appeteaser as they call it, we had PERI-PERI hummus and pita. The warm grilled pita made the dip a delightful experience. One plate is enough for two.Next, we had the Portuguese salad. Although the menu stated green and red leaf lettuce, we had bitter arugula and what looked like Swiss chard as well, which we didn't really enjoy. The food didn't correspond with the menu and so we got what we weren't looking forward to.For the main, we had the quarter chicken with a choice of side orders and PERI-PERI sauce. We were served a chicken breast each. Most of the time, when quarter chicken is in a menu, we get chicken legs, so we presumed that we would be served chicken legs, which we both enjoy, and so we were disappointed with the dry grilled and roasted chicken breasts. We asked later and were told that we could have asked for chicken legs. Apart from the dryness, the chicken was really tasty.And you must try their Sweet Potato Mash. It has cinnamon and PERI-PERI added and is simply delicious. Their chips are also worth trying, better than the average fries you get at most other places.If you prefer drinking water, it is free.On the whole, it was an enjoyable experience and I would go back again
1
Was here with wife n sis-in-law. Monday afternoon 5.00pm. Place wasn't crowded with afew staffs up at the frontage not attending to any customers. Served to sit at table by the side of restaurant. After 15 mins still no one take our order. Signal a staff n she waved for us to wait. 10 mins later still no one bothered about us n we decided to leave. At the entrance, we were greeted with thanks for our patronage. Lack of awareness who are their customer. Will not visit Plaza singapura nandos again.
3
I've never had to queue as much as in Singapore for food, and here was no exception. Finished shopping in the mall and decided to grab dinner somewhere easy. Waited for nearly an hour [I know, but the chicken does taste good], and then we were seated. No option to pour my own drinks [and I tend to drink a lot during dinner] was frustrating, and there didn't seem to be enough staff on. We were also seated right next to the queue, meaning a hungry audience whilst we ate
3
Saturday early evening, restaurant less than half full.Food to the usual standard expected of Nando’s internationally. Unlike Nando’s in other countries it is waiter service rather than order own. Staff not forthcoming to help. Struggled to order, order incorrect, struggled to get bill etc. Many tables left uncleaned for duration of our meal
3
I visited this place with a friend for lunch during a weekday. The place wasn't much crowded. But still the waiter took so long to come take the order. He said the waiting time for our meal would be 15-20 mins. But we waited for more than 45 min and the waiter who took our order didn't come back to check if it had arrived or not. After complaining to the head-waiter, we got the food within 15 min. They gave us a complimentary soup to apologise for the delay which was horrible anyway.If not for the quality of the food and the sauce which is unique to this place, I would never again want to go here considering the very bad service
4
Nice food and service. For appetizers must try the "altogether now". The olives are juicy.. The servers are very knowledgable about the food and the recommendations were great. I tried the peri peri chicken "hot" and it's really hot hot hot.. For those who doesn't like spicy i would suggest lemon and herb.. :) the rice serving is good for light eating so if you're a rice lover, you might to order extra rice... ;
4
very addictive, spicy (peri - peri), definitely will excite your taste buds from before the first bite.whoever is incharge of recipe department knows what their doing! I had ESPERTADA RUSTICA! one of the waitresses recommended this and it was yummy.Food selection is great, if your a checken lover this IS the place.Service is very good and prices are very reasonable too.I left the place with a few bottles of their special peri peri spices on sale in their restaurant
5
If I am in another city or country, I pray that there is a Nandos, and guess what!? Singapore has an awesome Nandos! Nothing like Australia where it's basically an upgraded fast food restaurant. Here you sit down, a waiter comes to your table, they sell alcohol (although now they have stopped this) and it's just a great dining experience. The air con makes it very comfortable, and the chicken sizes are actually very reasonable.
4
Five stars for the chicken and minus one star for service staff. In the number of visits made to Nandos (Plaza Singapura & Starvista) the food remains consistently good and service gets worse. I guess the lure of perfectly cooked chicken drenched in piquant sauces is greater than the put down by downright bad, rude & inefficient service. Both aspects need to be highlighted in the review of this restaurant. We think that by now we are immune to the quality of service but it still pinches. I can understand that service is slow with the kind of turnout they have, but the rudeness and lack of attentiveness of staff is not excusable under any guise. And yet we return again. Wonder how management turns a blind eye to this. Maybe this kind of service is the only way to regulate crowd for them
5
Like every drop of its chili, must try for spicy food and chicken lovers!
All Peri-Peri chickens are marinated for 24 hours and I find the taste extremely unforgettable!
5
Sorry Bugis Junction Nandos and good bye Tanglin Mall Nandos. Welcome plaza Singapura. Not too far from my home yet I missed this gem. Tasty well cooked chicken and sides and cocktails. I think that sums up my review.
4
We fell in love with Nando's on our visit to London and have dined in their Regent Street and Park Street branches several times. It was a pleasant surprise to find a branch in Singapore manned by friendly Filipinas who made us feel right at home. Ordered the whole chicken (spicy) with four large sides (corn, Mediterranean rice and spicy rice). The chicken is tender and oozed with spices with every bite. I would recommend this place if ever you're shopping at Plaza Singapura (Orchard Road)
5
Took some foreign guests. Everyone enjoyed it. The flavor options cater for them all. They loved the cocktails. Chicken was moist and cooked to our liking. Ask for extra mild sauce to pour over the chicken on arrival. Enjoy the love fino sides. Sweet potatoe mash is my favorite. Nandos also has the twists for Asian tastes with the angry mango options. Be careful of queues during peak hours. Still well worth the wait.
4
Went with a friend after shopping at Plaza Singapura's Nando. Staffs all had this bored look of their faces. When I was looking at my menu, the waitress just came over and asked me if I would like to order, when i just sat down! Poor service. Hate it. Had 1/4 chicken with 2 sides. Had the Mediterranean rice and Spinach. Chicken was nice, delicious! Crisp skin on the outside, tender and juicy meat in the inside. Well seasoned, well cooked, not dry and smells delicious. The Mediterranean rice needed a little bit more salt. Does not taste Mediterranean at all with the frozen tiny bits of vegetables inside. Spinach was under seasoned and tasted spicy and a little bitter. However chicken was the main star of the dish, so I am pretty happy with the dish. Had the cocktail Citrus along for my dinner.

Went to Nandos tonight. Had a great meal. Could have eaten a whole chicken all on my own. The sauce is great, the service is friendly and it was lovely meal. Thank you to the staff and the back staff. Well cooked food!Reason only 4 stars is because service was a little slow to get a drink. Also the order was not correct first time. This was because it was busy... Something for management to consider. In any event, the food was fast getting to the table... Full marks there

Big Nando's fan, hard to believe this is the same franchise. Slow and disinterested staff, untrained amateurs. After eventually getting my order in, the peri peri chicken well below standard of other Nando outlets, fries were cold and very old, garlic bread about the same (was the garlic on it I wonder, as bland) in all very disappointing and never again at this outlet. Its not cheap given what it is but thats Singapore these days. Stick to other outlets here

On every visit to Nando's in Plaza Singapura, we always order full chicken with extra hot peri-peri sauce. The food is fantastic and I could never get enough of. Ordered with a large Peri-peri Chips makes the meal perfect. I've always been a fan of Nando's back in the 2004 (in Holmesglen and Chadstone Shopping Centre in Melbourne, Australia). The price however is a slightly more expensive in the Singapore counterpart. (AUD$24.90 for full chicken + Large Sides compared to SGD ($49.00 for full chicken)

I've always loved Nando's since my first bite in Birmingham back on 2004. Can't describe how happy I was when it opened in Singapore. The portion, however are smaller here. Price wise, a steep on a high side compare to the size of the chicken served. But the authentic Peri-peri flavors are still there to satisfies my cravings. The chicken served were succulent and juicy. I always brought home 2 or 3 bottles of the Peri-peri sauces with me for my home-made Peri-peri grilled. It's worthed.
