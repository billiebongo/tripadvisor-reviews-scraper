Met some locals who asked how I found the restaurant and knew about it. A very pleasant experience to share a meal with local residents

Was there for lunch with my family today and the great food and service. Mr. Pang the owner is very welcoming and great at recommending dishes to your taste. Also they have a Lovely selection of desserts to end a perfect meal too,

Good place to have your meal if you prefer less busy/quiet environment. Ordered the beef burger, served at medium rare. Servers are attentive and friendly. Definitely will visit again.

We went to the branch at Palais Renaissance for dessert on my husband's birthday. Ambiance was good and staff were friendly. I asked the staff for a lit candle to go with the cake. To my surprise, they even sang a birthday song when they served it. It seemed like an impromptu arrangement between the staff and I really appreciated it. The place is quiet with few patrons on a Wednesday evening. Because of this, the background music was not drowned by any chatters. I recommend the hot chocolate (not stated in their menu, $6), it is rich and thick. The cakes are quite pricey though, $8+ for a small slice

I visited the branch at Palais Renaissance with my friends for lunch. It was a very nice setting with great atmosphere. Surprisingly quiet during a bustling weekend. We ordered a lobster pasta, a salted-egg pasta, a carbonara pasta and a truffle fries to share. Frankly the food failed to impress me. The pasta of the lobster pasta itself was good, but the lobster was not fresh; it gave my friend gastrointestinal issue. The salted-egg pasta was surprisingly not salty and being overpowered by the mentaiko. The carbonara and the fries were good though, no complain on these.I wouldn't mind returning, due to the ambiance and decent food

It's a very nice and comfortable place. Milo dinosaur cheesecake was awesome. Roasted duck was also very yummy. Would definitely visit again. Highly recommended.

My wife and I has been patronising P. Bistro at Palais Renaissance at least 2 to 3 times a month. We really enjoy the quiet cosy ambience and the food/wine is really good.The Truffle Fries is one item we never failed to order We would definitely highly recommend if you are looking for a place for good food and service.

I went to this place in the shopping centre. This shopping centre is very quiet because all the outlets are classy boutiques , facial therapist centres, (not much people went there.)Naturally, P.Bistro is also very quiet at this time.I went there because it offer one of the best afternoon tea set.Waitress asked me whether I want coffee, tea or cuppucino.I pick cuppucino.High tea set come with 3 tier. One is hot snack, deep fried prawn, and meat ball, another are pastries, and sweet desserts. and another is mini burger with sweet potato fries. Quite filling..After eating, I felt satisfied.. When I asked for bill , I expected to pay higher because cuppucino was included.When I checked the bill, I was pleasantly surprised that total bill is still under $30.Afternoon tea set with coffee /tea/ cuppucino is $25 , excluding service charge and GST

A simple place at Palais building in Orchard Road. We enjoyed their avocado salad, baby back Ribs and pasta. Nice staff!

Excellent bijou bistro with a simple but tasty menu. Friendly and attentive staff. Very affordable and great atmosphere.

The Orchard Rd can be very noisy at every corner, and if you seek a spot where you can reclaim your sanity, I would recommend that you seek out P. Bistro. It is serene, quiet, the food is good, the service is outstanding. You can enjoy some peace in the midst of your hectic schedule. Lovely place.

The place is nice and cosy. The service is pleasent and friendly. The food is good too. If you look for a quiet and nice corner to chat with a friend or read a book, this is a good place. A bit out of the popular places though.

We ate dinner here because my husband wanted a steak around 5 pm and most restaurants don't open until 6 or later in Singapore. P. Bistro advertises U.S. imported steak (which seemed unusual since Australia is much closer). The steak was cooked to order and served with a few new potatoes cut into pieces and some vegetables and mushrooms and included a side of a lovely mushroom sauce for the steak. The steak was tender, though mine had an encasing of thick fat on the side of it; my husband's did not have this fat. They were strip loins by cut. The food was good. The service was very slow and we had to ask for the check a couple of times over the course of 20 minutes in order to settle the bill at the end of the meal. The restaurant was not busy at that hour; people sat at only four tables. It is a good place to take a break from shopping or to get a bit and a drink.

It rained all day on the day I visited this restaurant. Just out of the rain, this is the perfect drink. Savoring this hot Kumquat Honey drink, after getting out of the rain. The kumquat had been infused with honey. The hot tea has a nice infusion, creating a mild sour drink. Helps whet the appetite for lunch too! - Fresh pomelo with tamarind dressing: A nice zesty salad to kick-start lunch. Love the crunchy fried shallots, cut onions and cut red chilli on top. Always thought pomelo is only available during the mooncake festival. Now I can have it here when I want to have pomelo!- Fugu bak kwa: Grilled Japanese puffer fish topped with Japanese mayonnaise and ebi roe. Bak Kwa was thick and sweet.- Roasted half chicken: Seasoned with spiced herbs, with shoestring fries, fresh salad and a side of mushroom sauce. The chicken looks fried but its not. It's fried for a while to to seal the flavors in, before being roasted in the oven. The oil is baste over the chicken continuously giving the skin a nice crisp.- Interesting to find Asian dishes, such as this Nonya Dory fish dish. Pan-fried dory fish, topped with the Chet's special Peranakan sauce, served with brown rice topped with a sunny side up and a side of sweet and sour achar. - Really loved this. Fresh KÃ¼hlbarra Barramundi fillet pan seared with poached seasonal vegetables and lemon butter sauce. The Fish was moist and tasty. The skin was really crispy. On my list of 'To-order' the next time I am here.To finish the meal, I ordered a Flat white. The coffee is freshly brewed Dutch Colony Coffee with a Star Wars - Darth Vader coffee art. This was nicely paired with this Coconut Pandan Chiffon Cake. The cake is Pandan cake, with coconut mousse in between the cake. It's covered with whipped cream with desiccated coconut and white chocolate shavings. A good meal, and a hidden find indeed

P bistro is a cosy and quiet restaurant which I enjoy going to with my husband. In fact we used to frequent it at least once a month, sometimes twice. The food was always tasty and service excellent. However the previous experience left me with some fear of going back there again. I visited the place on a weekday night at about 8 pm. The beef balls served in my beef Bolognese were raw and cold (to the point of refrigerator temperature) in the middle but appeared pan fried outside. I returned the dish and they recooked it again, but I was feeling very uneasy as I feared food poisoning over the next few days. I had eaten a few of the meatballs before realizing the problem and was very anxious over the possible consequences of food poisoning as I am also expecting. Luckily nothing happened. I really miss the place and the food but my husband has banned me from going back there again. I think it's a one off event which should hopefully not happen to any customers. But it shows how a tiny slip up could so quickly erode the trust an old customer has in the reputation of any food establishment, especially when it concerns food safety and hygiene. For people going to the restaurant I would recommend the prawn garlic pasta (photo attached) - with the warning that it can be rather spicy! And also, the avocado ice cream is lovely.

P. Bistro is a very pleasant cafe-style bistro in residential Singapore, near Novena. It has a relatively small menu, but there should be something on there to please most people. I had the Thai beef fillet salad, which was tasty and fresh. The portion of beef fillet was both generous and high quality. Service was attentive, although I was the only diner at the time. Overall, a pleasant experience, and I will return with some companions

We had a weekend lunch there and tried 4 of their main courses, including the signature Nyonya Dory, the braised pork belly, the roasted chicken and the Prawn aglio olio. The quality of food is good and ambiance is nice and cosy. That being said, this is probably the most expensive place on Owen Road and Rangoon Road. Theres plenty of other options that might be better value for money. Menu could also be more adventurous - it is a generic western food menu with little excitement (apart from a thai salad and a Nyonya dish)

This charming gem is literally hidden because it is below ground level in a commercial building with no outside signage. We discovered it while looking for another restaurant at the same address.The congenial proprietor is named Pang, who serves as maitre d'. The varied menu has a French accent and includes meat,fish and fowl. Pang's wife, Min Yee, is the pastry chef and the quality of the desserts displays her year in Paris as part of her training. Prices are very reasonable , especially as the location is in the high-rent district of Orchard Street.All major credit cards are accepted.Note: most Singapore taxis take credit cards, but none will accept Visa. Many small businesses also reject Visa. MC and Amex are preferred
