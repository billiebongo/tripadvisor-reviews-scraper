Had their steaks, a little too medium for my liking (requested for medium rare).
Ambience is nice to sit outside and service is prompt.
If not for entertainer, wouldnt think its gna be worth.
1
Go there if you want to experience poor service. Do mention the entertainer app to the manager to elevate the experience.

A great spot for a burger and a beer near the bay that won't break the bank - and good beers and ales on menu from the Archipelago Brewery.
5
Good place for drinking near merlion Singapore. We taste Beer . There are many kind of beer. We tasted three of beers . I recommended

The food presentation is beautiful but the food isn‚Äòt. Was the driest burger patty I can remember. We asked for the doneness and were told it would be medium. It really was well done and zero juicy. Even for a third of the price the charge I would have complaint.

Dont waste money on their ¬´premium¬ª meals. A shared beef platter is not possible to get right. First beef we tried was almost raw. However the waiter claimed it was medium without looking. After a trip back to the kitchen the same pieces came back. Ok for the previously undercooked beef but now the others were cold. Back again resulting in them being totally overcooked and dry. No new pieces offered, only back and forth with the same food. Terrible service, no appology and in the end they did not even managed to split the bill. Beer they got right but that was all. Eat somewhere else.

We came here to dinner after a concert, and left really disappointed and frustrated because we were very hungry and EVERYTHING we ordered was bad.We ordered a pizza, beetroot salad, ribs and truffle fries.. how can you mess up the fries?!?!? We couldn‚Äôt finish any of the dishes.. BADTo make things worse we ordered a glass of water and they brought a bottle, letting us know there was no tap water... just to see the table next to us getting.. tap water

We came here for our last meal in Singapore, after a pretty gourmet week. What a disappointment! I had steak, a choice which I have made many, many times in restaurants all over the world. The steak I had here has the dubious honour of being the worst ever. I could only eat half of it, which may be a blessing as it has no taste. Unfortunately I wasn‚Äôt able to pass this onto the restaurant directly, as no-one even asked us if we had enjoyed our meal. We didn‚Äôt.

Came here for lunch recently with a colleague. We each opted for one of the lunch sets consisting of a soup and a main. Total bill was slightly less than $40 which was reasonable value for money. I had the burger which wasn't bad. Soup was average. Nice and quiet here at lunchtime
3
We called in here for dinner one evening and got a seat straight away but then the waiter seemed to forget about us - it took an attempt at trying to get his attention by myself and then even by some other customers before he realised we were ready to order. Had pizza and chicken wings to share between us - food was fine for what we were wanting
5
Probably one of the best food I have had in Singapore. Really good location and welcoming staffs too!!!
5
The food is very good! Second time here! The steak is good and so are the bugers! Very convenient!!!
5
A must try pizza and carbonara. The foods are delicious and the staff are very well accomodating too!
4
Great service, especially by Norman who was very thoughtful, placing the food and drinks out of reach of our mischievous toddler. Barossa blue cheese steak burger was yummy too. Nice ambience that was fairly near the waterfront. Will be back!
4
Ate steak and it was great! Wasn't really medium-rare enough but the service and ambience was nice with a good view of Marina area.
4
The steak was not bad! Loved the ambience, truffle salt and the bearnaise sauce was a great touch to it! Service was good too.
5
Excellent place with great ambience and food. Staff were really friendly and proactive. Would definitely come back :)
2
I ordered a medium rare steak which I literally had to saw through with a blunt bread knife. Way too overcooked and definitely was not what I ordered.
3
Called in here for lunch after lots of wandering around and had worked up an appetite. Menu looked great but sadly was a bit disappointing. It probably is a great spot in the evening when the kitchen is happening but sadly was just average for a late lunch when it was quiet.
4
The only frustrating thing was to get the attention of the wait staff - they were not that attentive considering it's peak hour. But no complaints on the food. Smoked duck pasta was awesome. Tasty and satisfying. The beef patty with bacon and beetroot gave the burger a good mix of flavour and texture. Like it that it's not too saucy and the piece of patty was juicy
4
Great food, venue and ambience! A great place to hang out in Singapore ! Great music.
There are great choices of beverages as well: white, red, house wine !
Great for wine lovers. :)
4
Good service and location. Lunch time set menu is reasonably priced and good for a quick stop. Could be nice to sit and have a few drinks in a night.
4
It is a really chill and good place to hang at after a long day at work! The service here was great. I will definitely come here again.
5
Service staff were extremely attentive, and food was perfect.
Ambience was cosy, great for a quiet night out :)
4
Good food. Good service. Great environment. Loved the barossa blue cheese steak burger and aglio olio. Will be back to try the steaks and pizzas.
5
Great food and music. Great place for gatherings. Staff are very accommodating and friendly. Happy hour price are good, so come early!
5
Food was totally Great! NORMAN entertaining man! How we wish we can stay long! Work nearby if the is discount will be GREAT!
4
Nice ambiance, very friendly and attentive restaurant manager-Norman, nice plating and good ribs! Good to chill with friends by Marina Bay and can watch the MBS Light show from the bar.
5
Great place to come with group, lots of seating. Happy hour deals for beer and wine are great. Ordered pulled pork burger and pork ribs! Both were excellent.
5
After a miserable meal at Harry's the night before and being turned away from Supply & Demand because we wanted a table for 8 (or was it my 84yf old mother in law in a wheel chair they objected to?) Anyway. We were greeted warmly by the staff at Barossa and they soon organised a table for 8. Drinks were quickly ordered and delivered and after a lot of debate we ordered food. And what food. Absolutely fantastic. The difference between the food and service between Barossa & Harry's (almost next door) is night and day. I had a Perth Rib Eye Steak that was perfectly cooked and melted in my mouth probably the best steak I have had in 5 years.. The extra sides of Rosemary Fries & Sauteed Mushrooms were wonderful. My Brother in Law loved his Full Rack of Ribs, My Wife her Pizza and Salad. In fact our whole table had not a single word of complaint. Fantastic food and service. I was feeling quite let down with the service we were receiving in Singapore but this set everything right again. Recommended
5
Wow. Its a surprise that we got a 50% off 2nd burgers here until 31 aug. come grab ur fav burgers!
I love the beer here! ;) super smooth!
4
My Friend and I came down to Esplanade and ate here. The Pizza and steak was good, cooked to my liking.
4
Loved the ambience by the awesome river view, service was decent. Would recommend getting the Coppa ham pizza! Overall a nice place to chill for brunch!
5
Just had a fantastic meal here. Portions were generous. The beef was well-seasoned. Staff was attentive. Had a discount on Eatigo, so well worth the money!
5
Excellent food good atmosphere friendly staff - especially Jamie -
Next to esplanade theatres
Good setting near marina bay -
5
The food were great! Though the price is above average, it was all worth it. The steak was perfect. The pulled pork was juicy. The nachos was superb. The staff was very accomodating and the service was perfect. The Filipino crew were excellent!
4
Nice steak! Great service by Chris who offered to give us a bigger table so that we can dine comfortably! He made sure that our glasses were always full! üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª
4
The location is very convenient for public transport, it is near bus stops, taxi stands, and MRT. Plus ambiance is very nice, overlooking the marina bay. Food is also good and the staff has great service.This place is ideal when you want to chat with friends. This is a western style where you can eat and drink
5
I have ordered a Barossa snack platter, coppa ham pizza, and the Perth meat export sirloin which is 120 days grain fed. The snack platter is really good for family sharing. The coppa ham pizza is great for kids. For the sirloin steak is really good enough. However, I think the angus rib eye will be wonderfull and it is only $2 more
3
I have dined at this restaurant a number of times now. The food is consistently good value for money and the menu varied enough to cater to everyone's tastes. But... the service is terrible. It takes forever to have your order taken... takes even longer for someone to acknowledge you to ask for the bill and god help you if you actually require change! The place seems to lack organization and staff are frazzled and dismissive as a result which is a pity. Would I return? Yes... but I need to remember to bring my patience with me!!
5
Food is nery nice. It is delicious !!! We all love it. I suggest to try mediterranean pizza with feta and lamp !! The place is great üòç
5
Food is great. I visited the place with some of my friends and everyone liked it. Love the place would recommend!
5
Order a steak and a half rack ribs, both were delicious and we finished everything! Made a reservation through eatigo which gives us 30% discount at 7pm, awesome way to end the night! üòã
4
Food is nice! Great service and food! Will definitely recommend to my friends to dine here!! Awesome!
5
Dropped by for drinks and dinner... Great ambience, lovely music. The desserts are a must have. My sis liked the fish her fish a lot
4
Friendly service with wide variety choice of food. The staff is also very helpful to give us good recommendation on what to order it is our first time here
4
Shared the starter and steak platter and both were superb and done to perfection! Truffle fries were lathered in truffle oil and were amazing! Steaks served were also really good. Will be back for more! Highly recommended!
5
Nice place with great view for the marina bay. Excellent service, food and beer. Everything was amazing.
5
The steak platter for two is really a must try. The quality of the beef is close to the one we tried in States and Japan. The doneness of the steak was cook to our expectation which is medium rare. I have to say, you don't need the sauce to eat the steak. Both me and my partner enjoy the steak.
1
The food was generally greasy and tasteless. Big Mac tasted better than their over-priced non-creative burgers. The poster said 'American street food', I seriously doubt it.Indoor was very rowdy and noisy, about 20 people crowded around 3 tables disturbing other diners. Not recommended for family
5
Very well cooked steak, was seated and served promptly too, staff as briefed on the offers for the day to ensure the best experience.
5
Really good steaks and sides that i would definitely come back to.
Affordable prices and drinks and front view of marina bay sands
4
Had the ribeye platter and it was perfectly medium rare. Accompanying saute mushrooms were exquisite too. Service was good, ambience was relaxed and casual.
4
The steaks here are excellently made, enjoyed every single bite. Definitely a must try! Go for either the lunch menu or the steak sharing menu, their burgers and desserts are good as well.
4
Had a nice dinner ! Ordered the Rib Eye Tasting Platter and it was just nice for the 2 of us , but since we are big eaters , another pasta wouldn't hurt. üòä
5
Nice food and good ambience for dinner. Blue cheese steak burger is good and highly recommend! Good for dinners when it is cooling
5
Good food at a nice location next to esplanade waterfront. Great friendly servers. Highly recommended.
5
The foods are very delicious specially Barossa Salad, you must try! Uhhhh I will surely come back in this bar! Thank you so much also for the good service.
1
Went to their outlet and Esplanade to try, since Holland V outlet never fails us. To our disappointment, almost half of the mains are not available for lunch (2pm). Reason was that food stock was already low few days back according to staff, and this was only been stocked up. This is a F&B outlet, and that food stock should always be ample. This will be our first and also last visit to Esplanade outlet
5
Located in the heart of Singapore, one of the finest spots to chill and hang out with friends. Good ambience, decent variety of drinks menu and nice collection of good as well. Early evening time is recommended to come and it's just a side to fabulous Esplanade Theatre. Also can enjoy the wonderful sceneries around Singapore River, through cool sips of your favorite drink.
5
The Mediterranean Lamb Pizza and the Beetroot Salad were very good. Zack served us and gave excellent service.
5
This place has a nice ambience coupled with polite and friendly staff. Steak is tasty and definitely worth the penny! üòä
5
Tried the Ribeye platter and was not disappointed. Definitely recommended, will visit again in future. Service was quite good but maybe it's due to the fact that we were the only ones there during non peak.
5
I had the BEST STEAK this month at Barossa! Juicy, tender, succulent - YUMS, will be back for seconds!!!!!
5
Value for money and great view ! Wagyu beef and ribeye were both really tasty. The sharing platter is recommended !
4
Nice burgers and great view of the marina bay. Friendly staffs. Share a review like this and you can get free dessert ;)
5
The plating comes with tender steak, sweat tomatoes, crunchy vegetables and 2 flavory sauces. Will come back again
5
Excellent service
Good food and hang out place
Ordered the ribeye medium, it is juicy and come with good sauces
5
Barossa used to be my favorite spot in Holland V till they closed their doors permanently. Awesome pub food, excellent steaks and local craft beers. Esplanade outlet doesn't fail us either. Chugging a cold pint of Irish ale is the best way to spend any hot afternoon. You gotta check out this place if you take your beer seriously.
5
The food was wonderfully prepared and presented. The staff is knowledgeable and was very helpful in recommending the food on the menu.The food seemed like a well arranged symphony in the palate. The wine that was recommended was a perfect pairing with the food.It's a pity I did not visit the restaurant sooner 
5
Excellent food and great staff service. Will be back again. Was given a seat even tho my name wasn't reflected in the "reservation list".
3
Barossa Bar is located at Esplanade Theatre with good service and nice vibes. Good for evening drinks and light bites.
5
The rib eye tasting platter is an exceptional dish, with three different types of beef that all taste different yet delicious in their own right. This is our second visit and we ordered the same dish twice!
5
the medium rare steak is great.great burgerÔºÅjuicy and soft! Really love it ;) the white truffle source and black pepper sourse also.
4
Provides al-fresco dining experience with reasonably priced steaks and burgers. You get a stunning view of the Bay, especially at night. Definitely recommend you to give it a try and if you have Eatigo, they have discount offers now and then as well. üëçüèª
4
Waiters were attentive and polite. Ordered the barossa blue cheese steak which was delicious. The crispy onion strings complemented the tender beef slices well with their contrasting texture
5
Really loved the atmosphere here! Has their smoked duck linguine ($25) and it's definitely on my list of cream based pastas done right :) Definitely will be back for this again!
5
Good ribs, great ambience and nice music. The ribs were perfectly cooked and there was a wide range of beverages to choose from. Furthermore, the ambience was comfortable and relaxing, a good way to wind down at the end of the day! :)Staff was friendly and approachable and had good knowledge of the menu
5
Visited this restaurant on a Sunday evening and pleasantly surprised that service was efficient and food was served fast. The area was quite crowded as there was an event going on but don't feel the rowdiness even the place is an open concept. very delicious burger meal topped with signature cocktail a must tr
5
Always our choice to chillout on Friday evenings after work or just before catching an event at The Esplanade. Great ambience, nice food (we are always here for their pizzas), and great service! Attended by Chris today, a very proactive service stuff who is friendly, professional and attentive to our needs for the evening. Thank you
4
Food are nice, staffs are friendly, price reasonable. Very nice ambience too. Strongly recommend the steaks. :)
4
If you love beef, here will be a good place to give it a try !! Ambience was comfortable :)
And a good place to dine during early evening and weekend as there's beautiful scenery the the side üòä
5
Pretty ambience for a relax night after work. Beer and food were good. Strongly recommend for working adults to chill after work! Nice place for couples to date too. Will be back for more!
5
It's very great Resturant with super nice fries and drink. It has variety of drink also. Highly recommend.
5
The food and signature drinks was all great.. my friends and me enjoy the ambiance. The staff are all friendly.
4
We dropped in here after stroll around marina and food was excellent, service could have been better though
1
Venue was great, ambience was good. However, the service was a real put off. Food served without serviettes n cutleries. Staff were busy - walking here and there, like a lost child. Not attentive to guests need. Guests walked in, no staff retendered assistance. Guests waited for their table to be cleared, but a few staff marched pass without notice. The restaurant was not full
4
If you're the type of person that likes to eat and drink beer, then this is the place for you! I told all my friends about a time I had a burger here and wouldn't stop proclaiming it as one of the best burgers I've ever had. Surely enough, they joined me and decided I was right. Nothing better than an ice cold beer and a delicious meal
4
The smoked duck linguine was executed nicely - we finished every bit of it. Love the pepper cream sauce which wasn't too "gelat" and slightly addictive with every mouthful. Service was attentive, with service staff offering to give us sharing plates and refilling our water ever so promptl
4
It is good. We ordered fish n chips and chicken burger. The portions are big. If you are on a diet, this is going to be cheat day for 2 weeks. We had Erdinger and Blue Margarita. Both are very good. Barossa did not hold back on the liqueur for the margarita. Frosting on the cup is slightly sweet. Not what I expected. Well done. I will recommend this place for a place to chill.
5
We have had such a wonderful experience! Amazing service, brilliant atmosphere and prime positioning looking onto Merlion Park! A must go place!
5
I was having dinner at barossa with my friend today,the food and the service was great,will be back again
5
Lovely Aussie burger, fries and pint sat outside. Staff attentive and polite recommend trying this restaurant right on the bay
5
We had a dinner with my friends last week at barossa esplanade. I highly recommend this bar restaurant if your looking for a very nice place to eat and drink at esplanade mall. Service was excellent and the food as well. üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª
5
greeted by friendly staff, dined with one of the most amazing burger that i've tried, the barossa blue cheese steak, lovely! ambience was good enough but with the band that lucky night, it was definitely a plus point!
4
Had our chill dinner with friends. Enjoyed the food and the best service. üòä Must try! The price of the food is worth it, and all the staff are friendly.
5
The service was excellent great experience,food was nice drinks was amazing,will be back again with the family.
5
The food and drinks are very nice..Aslo the staffs there are very approachable and friendly..Definitely will go againüëçüëçüëç

I would like to compliment Barossa for having a wonderful staff like Chris and jen theire good in recomending the food just dine in in barossa the food was really excellent i try the bluecheese steak burger it was superb highlly recomended i will introduce barossa to my all friends and coleagues its a perfect place to unwind and chillwith great food and great service will surely comebac
5
Jay D was our server was so friendly and A-plus service. The chicken burger with the sweet sauce was well worth the walk along the river. I highly advise you to stop and meet Jay D and the reasonable priced menu will make it that much more of a destination
5
Love the rib eye steak platter. Medium rare as what i always order. Great music every friday and ambiance of the outdoor
4
The steak platter taste great. Ambiance is also nice as you will see the view of Marina Bay and luckily there was a concert (band) playing during the time we ate there
4
Staff were very approachable and friendly as well as the food and drinks are good..perfect place to hangout for a group..cheers
3
We stopped of here for a drink - didn't try any food.
Service was a bit slow but we enjoyed a drink while watching the crowds stroll by.
1
I had a beetroot and feta salad. It was really not good, it was just salad from a packet with nearly no dressing, tiny bits of feta and a few cherry tomatoes. I can prepare better salad at home, this is really a joke.
4
Visited this bar several times during our visit to Singapore for the Grand Prix, and every time, we have excellent service and excellent food. Would definitely recommend.
2
We were there Friday night of the F1 and it was busy. That being said. They were slow to serve everything. Drinks and Bill being the longest. This would make me unlikely to return or recommend
5
Me and my wife opted for a quick lunch. In the middle of Esplanade. One of their service staff welcome us with a great smile. So i told my wife why not. They recommend their Barossa Blue Cheese Steak, and they know their food. It is very tasty, portion is just enough, the taste is not overpowering, and their cocktails were amazing. Service staff were attentive and accomodating. Will definitely come back..
2
I took a guest there on a Saturday as we had a show at 3pm at the Esplanade and wanted to have lunch close by. Most places were closed and this place had a good menu with a wide variety. To cut to the chase:1) My big basket of nachos came with less than a tablespoon of salsa and guacamole. It was, of course, finished with less than 10 nachos. When I asked for more, slightly more came but served in plastic tubs, not in the ceramic containers they took away. It felt so cheap.2) We asked for a side of fries, stressing, "SIDE", clearly for one person. They gave us a regular portion, called it "Truffle fries" and charged us $12. Firstly, there was no taste of truffle. Secondly, the waiter should have mentioned this, taht we would get a basket of truffle fries for $12. I would have said yes anyway, but it would've been nice to know what to expect.3) Drink. The glass of ice-laden Pepsi my friend had was $6. What a rip-off - it wasn't from a can, but from a fountain. The volume of the drink itself was no more than 150ml, maximum 200ml. It's $6 for a drink at Four Seasons Hotel and you get a cold 330ml can plus all that ice.4) Water. They serve water in tiny glasses. With all the salt from the nachos, and the other food we ordered, we needed more. Not once did they top up the water without us having to ask.Service was slow and sloppy. The place wasn't busy at all, maximum 12 people at maybe 3 or 4 tables while we were there. There were 3 wait-staff.Sadly, there aren't many options at Esplanade on a weekend afternoon. It's worth allowing time for other places. I believe it is a popular bar in the evenings, always buzzing but I'll never come here again
3
Food here is actually not bad. Serving of the mushroom soup is pretty generous and comes with 2 slices of garlic bread. Maybe that's why its $10/-. The grilled chicken burger is not bad too. Just note that the service is a bit slow though it wasn't crowded
4
My husband and I visited Barossa Bar in early August this year. The food, service and drinks were great! We had a pleasant evening and the staff ensured we were looked after always. Great ambiance as well. Will be back!
3
Not a good experience as the waiting time is long. request for condiments takes 2 reminders. Food turn up lukewarm. Very under staffed
1
If you'd like to wait around 20 min. for a coffee - this is your bar/restaurant!They're unfriendly and slow.Most things on the menu wasn't even available and they changed my order without telling me anything... it's way too expensive for the service you'll get.... No go and never again
2
We have visited this place because we where hungry and liked the view, what a mistake !When we arrived i counted 6 staff members and an empty restaurant. Still it took us 20 minutes to place an order. The staff was ignoring us on purpose.After another 20 minutes we have received our burgers. The burgers where pretty tasty and the plate looked nice. I requested some napkins wich in a normal restaurant come with the meal but not at this place, after 15 minutes still no napkins. Eventually i when to the toilet to wash my hands. When i was paying (walked up to the counter since nobody came with the bill) i confronted a staff member and he was giving me the face. Really ?I feel sorry for the chef, the food is good. Will not visit again and If you want to have a nice night, avoid this place at all cost
3
We were frequent patrons of Barossa's Holland Village outlet, so we naturally gravitated to their Esplanade venue last night, to grab a bite before the opera.Ordered a meze platter for 2 and a couple of drinks, at the mostly empty restaurant. 25 mins later, and after having to ask, the food finally arrived. I then ordered a burger, which took almost as long. Judging from Joe quickly the drinks arrived, I'm guessing it is the kitchen that is on the slow side.The burger was juicy, with lots of flavors. The meze platter was tasty, although with that name you would expect middle Eastern flavors. It was mostly Italian cold cuts
3
Visited here late for dinner. Service was appalling. Firstly 2 red wines on bar menu they did not have- at $80^ a bottle we had to turn to house wine. Then 2 of the dinner meals we ordered were not available but he didn't think to tell us when we sat down 40 minutes before as that's how long it took him to take drink order and the then serve it. On the upside we had the salmon, ribs, burger and steaks and all the meals were great- just wish the service was as good as the meals- no tipping from us 
2
Singapore is generally not bad for bars around the tourist area but this one us sub par. Didn't eat here but the staff were between sullen and bored, slow and it's expensive. Whoever owns th 's place needs to shake it up before it becomes another unlamented loss. Avoid!
3
Food is actually quite good but staff are inattentive. You definitely won't be getting smiles from this group. Place is pricey and good only for those once a month get together with your peers or friends (This goes for the budget conscious peeps out there). The location is great though during the weekends but don't expect to be able to hold a conversation with anyone as there might be someone playing some music at the stage nearby
3
In the esplanade the location on the bay was great. The selection of European food was good and plenty of it when served however the service let them down. They didn't appear to be overly busy but the staff seemed flustered. Though my colleagues and I were patient, we did let them know we were ready for the orders to be taken, yet still waited longer than expected. The food order also came out one at a time rather than all together. So a bit disappointing.
2
We dine in here before watching Le Mis, I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t expected they will be very busy.The service was slow, our ordered salad never came while the rest of the order was served. We came back for my salad after watching the show. I just read the other reviews and I guess they are known for slow and inattentive service
5
Went there for a business lunch. Very good value for money set lunch . Attentive staff. Very scenic view of esplanade area.
1
We arranged to meet some friends from out of town here as it was close to their hotel - bad mistake! When we arrived the tables were piled high with dishes that hadn't been cleared yet.After sitting at the table for 15 minutes we started to clear our table ourselves and grabbed the menus, (and yes, we had signalled to a waiter we were waiting there) and not long after the chefs had to come out to help clear the tables.Eventually ordered our food which came out in dribs and drabs and was very average and not worth the price and constantly had to ask again and again for drinks, salt etcDon't blame the staff as they were rushed off their feet, but wouldn't recommend unfortunately eithe

Very terrible service in this high class area.The drinks are very disapointing as all the cocktail are tastless.Their wine menu every wine we pointed out is OUT OF STOCK!!We asked for plain water and it takes ages to service.The waiter that took order, repeat our order very softly and apparently missed out our pizza order (which of course we keep thinking why take so long to come). We asked a few different waiter to check out the pizza and NONE of them care to get back to us and say there's actually NO pizza in our order. Until the lady waitress came back and tell us.Last part is to ask for Bills also must call them twice then come.This will be our first and last time for this restaurant
4
dinner there on fri nite, luckily we have reservation before hand or we might not get a table. lots of office people having drink / dinner after work.nice ambience, very relax atmosphere.had the mushroom soup (a little too much of the olive oil), garlic cream pasta (if you like garlic), Mediterranean lamb pizza (thin crust and yummy), beef burger on polo bun (you can choose the bun such as sesame, polo etc. nice change, beef pattie is nicely done and juicy).they have dessert but we did not try them this time

Arrived at 12.10pm at Barossa, ready for a 2pm Performance of Les Mis at Esplanade. Only chose one course which was served after 1pm. At 1.30pm ordered coffee: at 1.45pm cancelled it. Managed to pay at 1.50pm as we went up to the till: and made it to our show on time Not sure about the people behind us in the queue at the till who were also trying to pa

Food quality aside, this must be one of the few restaurants with absolute lack of urgency. Was there at 7pm dinner before an 8pm show. While placing orders we had notified that we are here for a 8pm show and requested that they expedited the order, which they acknowledged.30 mins in, 3 out of 4 food orders came but none of the drinks orders came. We checked with them once and still no attempt to expedite the remaining orders. By the time they came, it was 745 and we had decided to cancel those which didn't arrive.A huge disappointment and what made it worst was that they were not at all apologetic. Note we were not the only table which were slow to be served.Pls get your kitchen process and order taking in place! And for wait staff to take more ownership!
5
I love how tender and juicy the steaks are. It's very tasty with or without a sauce. Better tasting steaks compared to Outback. The ambience is so cool especially on a Friday night. Love how they go the extra mile to kindly offer me and my friend that if we can't finish the bottle of wine we ordered, they can keep it for us until our next visit.
1
6 of us visited this bar, on a fairly quiet weekday evening, we sat down and were immediately given menus. 20 minutes later we were still waiting, we had tried to get the attention of one of the multiple staff who all seemed to ignore us. In the end one of the group went to ask and was told to sit down and someone would be with us, about 5 minutes later we finally ordered. We all ordered bottled beer as we decided it would take too long for anything else, 15 minutes later we complained and finally our drinks arrived with no apology, worst service ever
1
Staff were clueless about menu, mains arrived before starters, some starters never arrived. Didn't know that Cab Sauvignon was red so brought Pinot Gris instead, ran out of wine of choice after one bottle two times, with so many great restaurants in Singapore, no need for anyone to endure this place.

This place has a great teenage feel and is located off the bay off esplanade. The food was good but a little pricey. The service was very swift unlike the reviews mentioned here. The staff too was very courteous and attentive. All in all a good place to have Italian food
5
Arrived on a Monday lunchtime and the place was a bit quiet but the service was great and the steak I had was cooked to perfection and very tasty.
3
Reviews are pretty accurate. Service is slow, food is average, great location. Stay away from the chicken burger (my colleague ordered and it was very processed).

After spending some time looking at different places to eat we decided to eat in here, place was clean enough but the food was nothing to shout about and service was ok.

Looking for a good night out with old friends we headed down to the Esplanade for drinks and a water view. Service was so poor that we resorted to going to the bar and ordering as there was literally no one looking after us. Food was ok but they even got that wrong. We won't be back, what a shame this is a great looking bar in a central location

There are few things more frustrating than reading through a restaurant menu, selecting a perfect combination of dishes, placing the order, and then being told "sorry we don't have that today". Why did you bother giving me the menu? Why didn't you let me know which dishes were not available in advance? Simply poor service, poor training and poor management. Anyway to cut a long story short, this is a steak restaurant but they didn't have any strip loin. The replacement rib eye was well cooked and very tasty although a little slow in arriving (medium rare really should not take 30+ minutes to prepare). We were given the desert menu and then told that only one of the three choices was available. Why give us the menu? Fortunately the one choice available was creme brule which is one of my favourites and quite satisfactory

We came here on the second public holiday in the 2016 CNY season - for those that haven't been, Barossa is part of the Esplanade area, close to the waterfront and a great location. Unfortunately the management doesn't seem to appreciate how lucky they are to be there - our waiter opened his service by telling us half the menu wasn't available - no starters and no burgers, half the sides missing. We order from the remaining list, only to be told 10 mins later that one of the pasta dishes we had ordered was also out of stock - CNY, one of the busiest times of the year, loads of people in the area to visit the CNY fair and they've run out of most items, pretty pathetic.... When we finally managed to find items they did have, they decided to bring each person's food separately - in my case I received my two sides 10 mins before my steak but which time they were cold and congealed... This used to be the norm in Singapore but a number of places have picked up on the fact that diners might like to eat together at the same time - Barossa is a long way off the pace it seems. The food was ok, nothing to shout about but the service and management's inability to plan really let them down - we won't be going again..

My family & I dined in @ Holland V trying out the beef buffet. A Chinese guy (wasn't able to get his name) came over to introduce how the beef buffet works & to take our orders. I ordered an amaretto sour which was slightly off their menu but they were able to deliver it anw! The beef buffet was good!! He recommended us to go for the wagyu chuck tender & it was really good!! Best to pair with their bearnaise sauce the food came in a moderate serving as well. What I like about dining in there was how friendly the staffs were! There was a live band just beside our table which made it rather difficult for them to hear us but they never did show any irritation. Will not hesitate to come back!! Keep it up

In search of cold (affordable!) beer and some comfort food we decided to grab a comfortable table on the Esplanade. The place is clean, service friendly and efficient. Good choice of drinks priced reasonably and a decent selection on the menu. We chose a bunch of different bites to share including margarita pizza and sliders. All we nice, the sliders, although tiny, are fantastic, not a try hard offering that so often appears. Good choice
2
Dishes came one at a time over a 30 minute interval. It would have been really nice had the food been hot.The burger looked great with crispy onions stacked on top. We could only surmise they spent so long balancing them that the food got cold
2
We enter this restaurant because it was full, and we thought must be good, but maybe not for eatingWe order a hamburger a salad and fries. Fries tated funny like when they don't change to oil to fry for several days and the hamburger meat was almost burned, so I did not taste really great, the service was ok, if you want to eat there are better places in holland
5
There are two Barossa Bars, one in Holland Village, one in Esplanade. I visited the esplanade and was highly surprised with the meat quality and the service. There are $10 happy hour beers until 9 pm monday to thurs... nice atmosphere, calm.
3
Great, friendly, welcoming service. A lovely setting, with plenty going on around us, a jazz band playing and a cool breeze off the water front. The only bit that needs work is the food. Very average.
1
Pathetic. Service was horrible. Took forever to get someone to our table, and then if we needed anything later it was difficult to find anyone and get them to our table. Food took forever to show up. We had to leave at a certain time, and the food showed up way late, but within our overall window due to our other commitment. Wait - my dish was missing. I asked the waitress and she insisted we never ordered it. Four people, and three dishes arrive, and she is fighting over whether or not we ordered four dishes when my wife and I both clearly heard that we had ordered four dishes. Given the painfully slow service, there was no point now ordering the fourth dish. Food was OK, but all other aspects were horrible. Don't ever go here

The Barossa Bar currently has a value for money Groupon deal for its 6 gourmet burgers and half pint 3 types of lagers at $18.90 ending on 30 Nov 2015. They are offering a choice of lamb, beef and chicken burgers at a steal. Trying out their lamb burger for the first time, on a busy weekday night, I was impressed by the friendly and prompt service, the generous portions and the delicious food. The eggplant slices are grilled to perfection served along with goat cheese, nice portion of salad, fries and stack of onion rings on the patty. The live music which they have on Tuesday and Thursday is indeed a pleasant accompaniment at this relaxed location. I certainly recommend going back while this excellent offer last. Thumbs up to the friendly staff.

Either understaffed or lack of trainingHad to wait to get our order takenHad to wait for the entrees to come (so long that we had to buy food from the hawker center next door)Steak was thin and full of fat, not even one side dish but industrial saucesFried were cold and nothing done about itAsked twice for mineral water, never came until we were told they do not haveCaesar salad with soft croutonsShould I go on?Other Australian restaurants are much nicer in townArea is nice thought, nice walk after dinner, a lot of ambianceWill go back to the area, not this restauran

We were passing in the Marina and decided to have dinner in a table with a good view. We ate spaghetti bolognese that was tasty and served quickly. But the dessert was forgotten and we waited around 30 minutes for a chocolate cake that was very dry. The waiters were friendly but not very professional
4
Already had a drink here before and saw they serve some food so decided to come again and try the steak. It was nice, done like i wished with some side dishes. Its mostly a bar where you can eat some small dishes and not a classy restaurant. Didnt have any problem with the staff, prices are normal. Its a nice area to sit down and watch people passing by.

Street location on a corner in Holland Village was a relaxed venue for a pleasant evening meal. Fish and chips looked good, my sirloin steak was fine but not the best I`ve ever had. The guys had asked for rare but their steaks looked the same as mine which was medium. A nice evening but the food was not outstanding
1
We arrived at about 10 after a concert. We were not informed that the kitchen was already closed and we waited for 10 minutes before being informedWe then ordered finger food and drinks. After 20 minutes the food was delivered but one if the 2 orders was wrong.Another 5 minutes and a serving of extra oily 'fried calamari' ( so to say: calamari were buried into a mass of fried batter!! We did not even eat those ) was on the tableAs per the drinks: white sangria was a hint of wine some lemon juice and lots if ice. The cranberry juice was totally tasteless and just watery : bad experience not to do it again for sur
1
We wanted to go for lunch here, as we normally do every few weeks.The hostess was standing outside, having a smoke, shuffling some paperwork. I asked here where we could sit. Without turning around, she says " we open at 12" and continues her thing. It was 2 mins to 12 and there was already a table sitting with beers half finished. She finishes her smoke and walks off.We also walked off
1
Don't bother, the waiter if you could call him that was Terrible. He spilled the water all over the table with no apologies.

The so call free flow of beef slider was In fact free flow mini burger! You could hardly taste the beef as it's more like beef minced meat. E worst part was inside the mini burger - the "beef" was 1.5cm by 1.5cm size! So in actual fact - u r having free flow BREAD instead! To purchase this deal - it's better u jus go to any food court n order beef steak. U could at least Hv the taste of the beef! See the size of the so call BEEF SLIDER inside the mini burge

First of all, I gave it 4 Stars solely because I was actually quite impressed with the staff and the customer service they provided. If there is 3.5 Stars I would have chosen that solely because unfortunately I feel that their food (albeit looking gorgeous on the plates; beautiful plating and all) is quite average. It wasn't bad but it wasn't that fantastic either. I went there on a Sunday with my boyfriend at 12 pm right when they just opened for business.We initially went to the Esplanade Branch solely because we wanted to try out the Barossa Australian Black Angus Dry Aged, 25 Days Prime Rib (800-850 Grams) that is supposed to be available at the Esplanade Outlet only (and not at the Holland Village branch) but upon reaching the place, we realized that we were not THAT hungry and the thought of this huge slab of 850 Grams of Steak for just the 2 of us was really quite daunting and gave us the chills; so we opted for something else. I had the Char Grilled King Prawns marinated with Thai Spice on a bed of Shaved Fennels and Grapefruit Salad. I asked our Server Of The Day (who was fantastic) if the sauce is sweet...? As I really kinda hate sweet-tasting stuff in a supposedly-savoury dishes and I would really like it quite spicy. I was really pleased that he excused himself to check about it and when he came back he did inform me that it IS going to be a little bit sweet (so I had been warned) but the Chef said he can make it more spicy if I would prefer it to be. I think this is really wonderful of the server to take the initiative to ask and for them to offer the more-spicy-and-less-sweet version (this is due to the fact that my boyfriend kept mouthing in a-not-so-secretive-manner how I love my food EXTRA fiery hot and SUPER spicy, lol!) We also ordered the Barossa Mezze Platter (Jam√≥n Ib√©rico, Scottish Smoked Salmon, Grilled Vegetable Antipasto served with Grissini Cheese Sticks, Pita Bread and Homemade Babaghanoush) which was really good actually with the exception of the Pita Bread, cause the Pita Bread was kind of on the sweet side too; which is really weird cause as far as I know, Pita Bread is never sweet...but it tasted more like "cake" rather than "normal Pita bread"...My boyfriend had the Beef & Bacon Burger (with Crispy Bacon, Gherkins and Gruyere Cheese) I have to say that the meat was delicious! But the burger bun was (again) a little bit sweet...the onion rings that come with the burger was really oily...you can literally "squeeze" the oil out and have heavy drops of oil accumulating on the plate...I have to emphasize that all the staff were more than accommodating and the Customer Service level was really good. I just wish they could improve their food.That being said, we might come back for drinks or maybe even try the 850 grams of that Barossa Australian Black Angus Dry Aged, 25 Days Prime Rib!
4
The Esplanade Pre Show menu is a really good value of money and food tastes good too. $20++ per person comes with 2 courses of appetizer and main, additional house wine $5++ soft drink or juice $2++ dessert of the day $5++. Seats are allocated outside facing Marina Bay with good view but no air con can be a little hot.Waiter/Waitress are not professional enough

My husband and I had the utter displeasure of eating here during our visit to Singapore. We were sat at a table and given some menus, 15 minutes later we decided to call one of the waitresses over as it did not look like they were going to come over on their own accord, even though they were standing not two feet away from us. My husband ordered the Australian Black Angus, Dry-Aged 30 Day Rib Eye Steak (250 Grams), priced at $48 with a side of chips and I ordered the Linguine Prawn Aglio Olio, priced at $28. We waited a while and then a pot of chips for my husband was delivered to the table, we asked the waiter for salt and vinegar and he looked at us like we were speaking in an alien language, we had to gesture and repeat several times before he said ' I will ask my manager' (I kid you not), he came back with a small dish of salt and a another of vinegar, thankfully when the waitress saw what he had done she replaced them with the salt pot and vinegar pot. By this time we were wondering where my dish was and my husbands steak was. We decided to ask the waitress as the waiter was obviously on another planet, she said she would find out for us, it eventually came about 12 minutes after the chips had arrived and I still did not have my pasta. Five minutes later I noticed the space cadet waiter trying to give a bowl of pasta to the table two over from ours, bearing in mind they had only just arrived, I doubted very much that it was for them!! I started waving furiously at him and he eventually got the message, shuffled over to our table, plonked it on the table and shuffled off again. I dived into my food as I was starving by this time only to chomp down on some chilli and have it burn my mouth to bits, shock, horror, they had given me Spicy Pasta Primavera instead of the Linguine Prawn Aglio Olio, by this point I had lost the will to live and totally given up getting any joy from anyone that worked there so I ate it and kept my mouth shut. In the meantime my husband was quite literally chewing for his life's worth on his steak, it was so chewy and strangely did not even taste like steak he said. We finished our food, paid the $140 bill (Grrrrr) and made a hasty exit. We should have complained but there really was not a brain cell between any of them and we did not have the energy to be honest. Needless to say we will NEVER be back and I hope no one else goes there either. They need to take a serious look at their staff for starters

My friends and I went to Barossa at Holland Village for a drink. Firstly, I saw the board at the entrance that promoted a glass of Prosecco at $10. When I placed my order, I was told that it was no longer available and only a bottle was sold. Now, isn't the manager aware that he should have erased the chalk board so as not to mislead customers. Secondly I ordered 2 glasses of Sangria and I was shocked when I say how dirty the glasses were. When I called the waiter and asked him to observe the rim of the glass, he claimed that there was nothing on it. I saw a lipstick stain on mine and my friend has a strand of hair. I then called the manager who admitted that it was dirty. No apology but he changed my drink. I had to quickly run over to the bar counter to remind him not to pour the drink into another clean glass which he was about to do. When I had the Sangria, it was the worst drink ever. All i tasted was red wine with apple pieces and a slice of orange with no ice cubes. I had to bring my glass to get ice cubes. I have been to the outlet at Esplanade and had reasonable service. I am surprised by the level of quality at the Holland V outlet

What a terrible disappointment. We had been there on previous visits but we will DEFINITELY not return and would advise others not to go there. We arrived at about 1:30 pm. No opening hours were visible. We ordered what we thought should be a decent, albeit vastly overpriced bottle of white wine which was insufficiently chilled and with no means of keeping it cool. To our absolute surprise and total amazement at 13:43 we were presented with the bill and informed that they were closing. Is there a war on? What type of bar and restaurant in the international city of Singapore closes at this time. Needless to say we were charged 10% service charge but as we were left to finish our drinks on the terrace with no access to toilet facilities and the waiting staff having vacated the premises I do really wonder what that charge was for. In addition, on arrival our table was dirty and sticky and I had to move an ashtray full of cigarette butts which was still not cleared after the staff disappeared. The management do have to raise these matters with its staff if it is to even begin to survive

We sat down to dinner and drinks at around 7.40pm..we ordered two drinks and one order of wings to start which came in a reasonable amount of time and then we ordered our main course when drinks and wings arrived to ensure sufficient time to get these to us. However pizza arrived but half chicken did not. Trying to get the attention of any staff member from outside is impossible...so I had to walk inside to the bar to ask if half chicken would come before I was done with my pizza as we have been waiting. The lady at the bar said she would check and as I asked for water as well she apologized and said she would bring some by. After seeing the two tables next to us and behind us get their meals when we were here before them and since no water or explanation for the delayed service was forthcoming I flagged down another wait staff to try to find out when we would get the half chicken as my pizza was already cold.The lady apologised and said she would check and said she would get water. she returned with one glass of water or which I had to point out we asked for two glasses. Neither glasses were refilled even though the glasses sat empty on the table. The lady returned apologising again and stating chicken would be here in two minutes in which I mention saying sorry is not helping me any as food is so delayed. The chicken arrived at 9pm..very late..and we were told the kitchen was short of staff however I pointed out that other tables around us were getting their orders. The next was getting the bill also took at least 10minutes to get someone's attention and if the table next to us did not leave and need to be cleared I doubt we would have been able to ask for our bill without walking again to the counter to ask. When the bill arrived the waitress was in a rush to grab it and leave..I had to ask for any credit card promotions in which she stated in her rush that ocbc credit cards had a promotion but I had to ask again how much discount.At which time I made her wait while I switched credit cards as I felt I needed to get this10% back as it would cover the terrible service provided. It's sad that having a great location and atmosphere providing adequate service to every customer is not an easy task

Bought this Groupon deal for the beef buffet because of the advertised Wagyu on promotion. Apart from the beef cheeks (which were tender) and the nice selection of sauces, the other meats were served rubbery and rather cold. It seems to me that the meats were pre cooked (probably yesterday or earlier) and only heated up prior to serving as I get that kind of texture from left over cheap BBQ meat being reheated. Seriously, the wagyu was a real joke. You can get better cuts of beef from foodcourts at a fraction of the price. We left the place still feeling hungry and tired as the chewing made our jaw ache
2
Firstly I have to preempt the review with the fact that we were trying out the Holland Village branch in Singapore, not at Esplanade and we were dining using a trial Groupon promo. However regardless of the offer, you should be showcasing your best to entice diners back right?Sad to say, that this was very ho hum. Three of us went for Sunday night dinner on the Beef buffet. There were 3 generous steaks - Australian Wagyu, Ribeye and Sirloin - plus two slices of roast beef. I'd rate the Wagyu only as being tender and flavourful whilst the others were very bland and the Ribeye tough and stringy. Strangely theverything include veggies and condiments were served on a wooden platter and we weren't even consulted how rare or well done we'd like the meat? I was fine, but my husband requested further cooking, whereupon the kitchen delivered another whole platter.So ample quantity but quality was lacking. Holland V is a lovely atmospheric area with this stretch pedestrianised for on-street, alfresco wining and dining. However at the start of the strip, Barossa was still 70% empty on a weekend....Guess this says it all

Walked into this place by chance.Honesty my fish and chips were very good so was my daughters burger.Excellent fries.Service was friendly albeit a bit slow.Pleasantly surprised.
Love the location....Would rate between average and very good.

No amount of vouchers sold will keep this business afloat. Should have read all your reviews before buying our vouchers for dinner.

We went to Barossa for dinner before going to the theatre and truly wish we hadn't. The staff are disinterested and really anything is too much trouble for them. We tried to call the 'restaurant' in advance to book but they don't answer the phone as apparently they don't want to. They obviously get enough trade with walk ins, just keep walking... Please save your money and go to Mac Donald's. Two of us received our main (cold) courses one didn't, even though three of us ordered exactly the same dish, we kept asking and the staff who kept saying it would come.... It did finally when the rest of us had finished our food and really the food wasn't worth waiting for! Not good enough not even a hint at an apology. This place is a disgrace
4
As we were walking around the Esplanade looking for a place to eat, Barossa bar seemed like a good choice as the place had a welcoming feel and a great view.I am surprised at the number of negative reviews, for our experience was very pleasant. We were seated at the table of our choice for the view of thE Marina Bay and were served by a cheerful young waitress who was very helpful. They had about 4 brew on the tap and after a quick sampling, settled with the brew of my choice. As for the food none of was disappointed although their menu is limited. I had my favourite fish and chips which was very nice . The beef consumme was excellant as were the burgher and the sphegetti ordered by my two daughters. A decent fruit cake saw the end of our meal to a complete satisfaction. Surely a place to go to if in the area
3
My friends chose this place to eat and grab drinks! Terrible idea as I would not pick this place. I should have google-d this place first. The drinks and food are exorbitant! The servers were unfriendly and cannot even describe half of their menu, particularly desserts. I was going to give it a ZERO. But then we were sitting at perfect spot to watch the outdoor show, the desserts are good and my company was awesome
1
We have dined at Barossa before and had good dining experience. I bought 6 vouchers and brought my family for dinner. We were totally disappointed with the steak that came out from the kitchen. I do not understand why was there was a need to ask how we wanted our steak done when all the steaks that came out were either over done or rare. Imagine the piece of steak was charred and raw.  The first round of steaks that were served were stone cold, so were the saut√É¬©ed mushrooms. Subsequently the the steak that were served were sliced in a very haphazard manner. Some of them were very thin slices and some were in chunks that shaped like a trapezium. Some were quite tasty and some had no seasoning at all. It really spoilt our dinner and had no appetite to eat any more after 2 slices. We were so looking forward to a good dinner but left the restaurant sorely disappointed. It would have been better if the cut was smaller but thicker instead of large but thin slices. The chef looks like he didn't know how to prepare the beef nor cook it. If this voucher promotion is to promote Barossa, it failed badly. It goes to show the decline of quality and lack of attention to service. Do not recommend going there for dinner at all. We could have gone to a neighborhood coffeshop and get better steaks than at Barossa at a fraction of the cost. I felt cheated
2
This is typically one of those restaurants people end up in more than they would actually ever set-out to specifically have dinner here. The same for us. We actually wanted to have dinner at a nearby Indian seafood place which turned out to be fully booked. Barossa has an excellent location and the menu looked promising. I don't entirely agree with the reviews of the food here. But perhaps it depends on what you have and what your expectations are. It's basically pub grub served pleasantly, that is: nicely put on a plate but certainly not in terms of service. Appalling service in fact. We asked for water first while we decided on what to have. The water never 'really' came and when we had decided what to have and had found a different waiter suddenly it did come (though not chilled and in rather small glasses, not sure what was up with that). Then the beer came; we both had half a litre of beer. While my partner's beer was nicely chilled mine was lukewarm. When we complained about it it was promptly replaced however. While we appreciated it it should not have been served in the first place. After that it took quite a while for the food to arrive. Once it did we were not disappointed nor were we impressed. It's really... quite okay but that's really all that can be said about it. Obviously it took forever for the bill to arrive and after that again forever for our credit card to come back... And this is precisely what I will remember about this restaurant: not the food, perhaps the location a little but most of all completely uninterested and most of all slow service
1
We came for the buffet, and were utterly disappointed. The service was simply pathetic. It took 1 hour to serve the steak. When the steak came, it was cold. The steak sauces only came 30 minutes after the steak, when you are suppose to eat the steak with the sauces. It took longer than 30 mins for drinks to be served. The servings of the steak was really small. The horrible service and lousy just spoiled the nice view. The restaurant wasn't even at full capacity, and service was already slow. Take your money elsewhere.
2
We'd sat ourselves down for about ten minutes before anyone noticed us, it took another fifteen before our table was cleared of the previous diners' plates, another ten before our order was taken, and two reminders about our wine that took forever to come. Then, they got our order wrong and were less than apologetic. Their response? "Huh?" followed by an abrupt departure from our table: SO RUDE AND UNACCEPTABLE and then when they finally came back to us with an update, it was in passing on the way to serve another table! "One moment, ah." RUDE!!!!! Really, just totally disgusting service altogether. I don't know how this place is still around, it's like this every time I come. Like I understand that it's busy on a weekend but that just means you gotta fully prepare yourself with extra staff! Appalling. Don't waste your time here, literally.

We ordered wine and three different dishes. Soup was too salty, duck breast salad (can't find words) and a pizza without any,ANY, taste at all with greenish tomatoes. Cutlery and napkins we had to ask twice. The bar is toppled with dirty dishes all the time we had to spend there not recommended at al
1
The pasta was edible.
The pizza was lacking most characteristics of a pizza. The service was inexcusable. The apology was lacking.
Go elsewhere.
2
The place looked really nice, so we decided to have dinner here. We ordered two pizzas to share, it toke ages (>30 min) and we had to ask the waiter two-times until we got it served. It was the worst pizzas I ever had, they were dry, no real taste and overpriced. Also the jug of lager beer we had wasn't great at all. The service was OK and apologized for the pizza. Nice location but don't go there for pizza
2
We went to the Holland Village branch.I ordered the spatchcock chicken and my partner ordered the ribeye steak.The steak was, according to him, OK but not that great.The spatchcock chicken...Now that's an experience. The presentation was relatively unique. All the food was served on chopping boards.To cut the story short, the chicken tasted like it had taken a bath with a smelly dog that's been running around wet mud for a week(at least).I got one server to tell him the chicken tasted "weird". He told me it tastes "gamey" because it is a partridge...wild fowl.Another server stepped in and said it was chicken. I agreed it was chicken but it tasted bad.The server sent it back to the kitchen and came back to say the chicken was ok. In fact, the kitchen staff supposedly ate my chicken to taste it(did they eat my half eaten bad tasting chicken, for real?).In the end, the chicken was written off the bill.I won't go back there to eat...you guessed it!Chicken
4
Don't know if the restaurant has been reading its reviews, but this evening (Saturday) it was certainly doing better. Service was efficient and the food was tasty and well presented. Had the Beef Short Rib that was served on a wooden plater with wedges and salad ($26)
2
Found the ArchiPelago draught ales to our taste.Staff lacks ALL that it should have & know in order to provide good, attentive, considerate service.Ergo, service, such as it was, was the opposite of all that.Do consider another place, perhaps a dearth of customers will open management's eyes

Stumbled across this place during our first night in Singapore and thought that given it's location, which is central and near the food markets it would provide a good option for dinner. Very mistaken. First problem was trying to speak to someone to arrange a table. No central point organizing and the waiting staff were all either too busy or didn't care. We ended up having to negotiate with other couples who may have also been waiting for a table before seating ourselves. Long wait for menus. When the order was finally taken it was rushed with no eye contact and we had to call them back to order drinks as they left mid sentence. Food took ages to arrive and had to be chased twice. It still beat the drinks though. Food itself was poor - we complained that the red pepper and cheese burger only had one bit of pepper and the waitress just shrugged. When pushed she took it away and 10mins later it returned with 2 bits. . . Not the outcome we wanted. Bill was slow to arrive and already included the service charge. At this point another table was loudly complaining and refusing to pay the charge which resulted in staff members loudly mimicking then and making fun of them in front of the rest of the restaurant. Paid and left. One of the most disappointing dining experiences.

My son and I had a concert to attend, and circumstances led us to try eating near the Esplanade. Our boundary conditions for this were as follows:1. Him ‚Äì recently becoming very food-aware, he wanted to avoid deep-fried, and idle-calorie-laden fare.2. Me ‚Äì increasingly into raw and simple tastes driven by quality of ingredients, even less into standard 20th century fare than I used to be.3. Both of us ‚Äì we're into great value. Good value is available in Singapore ‚Äì but with increasing numbers of ‚Äúconcept restaurants‚Äù aimed at the bottom line ‚Äì one must do one's homework, and look hard, to find top quality and value. We didn't have time to get to Lau Pa Sat or another place better known to us, so felt constrained to the Esplanade's immediate surroundings.We checked area options. - Makansutra Gluttons Bay gets the only high TA rankings at ~170 of a stated ~3100 Singapore restos (an actual ~2650 places with actual reviews). Diverse review sites seem to ask, however, if it has slipped in its standard?- Harry's @ Esplanade (TA rank ~#1825 and is more a bar with food?), - Mirchi (~1900 average of two duplicate TA review pages ‚Äì and it's North Indian where we prefer South Indian), - Tomo Izakaya (TA rank ~2310), Sauce (no TA reviews, but mostly a bar), - Thai Express (TA #~1350 ‚Äì but debate seems to be about Thai-themed vs THAI food, and the places is reportedly a part of the Minor corporate food group ‚Äì founders of The Pizza Company ‚Äì purveyors of IMHO one of the world's worst forms of ‚Äúpizza‚Äù and we weren't ready for tiny S$13++ dishes of what could happen at such a place). - Barossa (TA ranking ~#2575 puts it at the bottom of all Singaporean restos, though TA's ‚Äúproprietary rating algorithm‚Äù often does strange things for places with small numbers of reviews ‚Äì and Barossa has only 16 posted reviews as this is written). Barossa seems to get kudos or brick bats ‚Äì with few in-between reviews. A polarizing place?With that bewildering background info, and shortage of clear winning options, we set out to find a place and eat - -Walking around, I saw a few things at Makansutra that I could try ‚Äì but our son could not. Ditto elsewhere. Challenges on the menu (including choices, food preparation, and often the value factors) were there for one or the other of us.The compromise seemed to be the ‚Äúburger‚Äù set at Barossa. A ‚Äúburger‚Äù with fries and/or salad and a half pint of Archipelago faux-craft beer, for S$18++. More than I'd normally pay for a burger (I grind my own burger fixins at home, so rarely go for restaurant burgers any more). But something had to give for us to reach our compromise. The final test ‚Äì would the resto give us no fries (neither of us wanted the grease) and substitute more salad ‚Äì or something else?Just then a server approached us. We asked her ‚Äì and her quick and cheery reply was sure, they could double the salad and drop the fries. So we grabbed seats.All seats that we saw were outdoors. Some were open-sky with benches, others were under a canopy with ceiling fans and chairs. We chose the latter ‚Äì though the great, relatively cool and less-than-it-could-have-been humidity had all other diners sitting under the open sky on the benches.About 6 choices of ‚Äúburger‚Äù were available. From beef (with portobello mushroom) to mutton, teriyaki chicken, to completely veggie. We both asked for all salad (no fries), and each chose different brews. BTW, beers are currently available ala carte many nights for S$5++ for half pints. For comparison, a glass of macro brew is $10 within the Esplanade, and pints in neighbouring places are $12 and above.When our server took our order she asked us if we were attending anything at the Esplanade. Points for that. We said yes and gave the starting time. A number of reviews had dumped on Barossa about slow or non-existent service. Have they taken this to heart? Certainly we had no problems as beer arrived in a minute, food in 15, and service staff were always around. BTW, the outdoor tables were about 2/3 taken on a Monday evening ‚Äì which seemed to be about average area eateries for this particular evening.Our burgers were both nicely cooked, spiced, and with nice accompanyments. The bun used was acceptable. The salads were delicious though a bit small in portion (e.g. they looked like single rather than double portions). The beer was moderately tasty. Both the wheat and the Irish ale were a bit thin-bodied, but acceptably tasty for the climate ‚Äì and very nice in contrast to the taste of the ‚Äúmajors‚Äù in the SE Asian beer scene.We sat, ate, drank, and talked until 15 minutes before our concert. We then called for the check, which came and was settled in under 2 minutes. We chatted a bit more ‚Äì then headed to our (also enjoyable) concert at the Esplanade.So food, drink, and service all did the job to our satisfaction. Price was a bit high (the small salad made this more apparent) after the ++ was added. I could have eaten nicely at Makansutra for half that amount. Did it walk on water like some reviews suggested? Nope. Was service or food terrible as some brick bat throwers have claimed. Not for us. Barossa was a perfectly fine compromise solution for the two of us. P.s. I say ‚Äúfaux-craft‚Äù for the beer. This is from looking at the distant and recent history of the Archipelago Brewery ‚Äì which was reportedly originally started by Becks and feaured Anchor {great name for a poor beer}. After shrivling almost to nothing it was taken over by rival Heineken-influenced former Malayan Breweries maker of Tiger (rated about 2 out of 5 by the Ratebeer community). A ‚Äúcraft-like‚Äù beer like Blue Moon or Shock Top, marketed as a craft beer but owned by industrial macro brewing interests seems more an attempt to fool drinkers, and to stave off the wave of true craft brewing ‚Äì which is also storming Singapore with good choices these days. ‚ÄúFaux-craft‚Äù or not, it was a pleasant alternative to the typical local industrial macro brews on the day of our visit

This place will not last long, it is awful. The saga begins when my wife try's to book, only to be told they are not taking reservations. So we think we'll just wonder pass and the place is empty. So we go in and get a get a seat.I ordered the burger, she ordered the beef cheeks. First I had a mystery gin and tonic, the mystery was if there was any gin in it.Both dishes arrived and were cold, so we sent them back, the second time they came back my wife's was ok, but still not that hot, but she ate it. The burger looked awful, they had put runny cheese and a tomato on the bottom of the bun and there was a brown sludge under the patty. This made the bun a soggy mess. So sent back again. The manageress explained to me why the bun was like that, and suggested they bring me all the pieces of the burger and I make it myself. I agree. Burger arrives, and I build it, it's still doesn't feel that warm for something that has just been cooked, I have two bites and find out why. It's raw in the middle.I was asked if I wanted anything else but by this time my wife had finished so I just gave up.If I could give the place 0 out of 5 I would

One of the worst experiences we had in a restaurant in Singapore so far. The main draw of this restaurant (and probably the reason it still attracts any guests) is its location - on a little square at the seafront, directly in front of the Esplanade. Nothing wrong with that, it's relaxed, quiet, a nice spot to sit outside and watch people strolling by. That is about where the good things stop: it's expensive but the service is terrible. We had both ordered the same dish but had to wait 45min for it without anyone telling us upfront it would take some time, or informing us in between or even apologizing for the long wait when the (half-cold) dish finally arrived.Afterwards, nobody inquired whether we had liked the food. After (unsuccessfully) having tried to get the staff's attention several times in order to settle the bill, we decided to follow the example of the people at the neighbouring table and paid at the bar. This place is not cheap but the experience was really disappointing. We will not go back

Not really much to say about this place. We showed up to watch the football and split a few pizzas. They had zero bottled beer at all (we had to order from the Indian restaurant instead next door) and despite 3 different attempts they couldn't get a simple pizza order right. We gave up and went somewhere else. Shockingly run

Went here for a quick liquid refreshment on a hot and humid day - quite expensive. Service was good though.

I am not a salad persone per se, but their Barossa salad was a great blend of nuts, different lettuces, avocado, bacon, tomatoes, and grains, and a terrific dressing. Strongly recommended. Service was highly attentive though i went there, twice, during off peak hours

Went to the Barossa at Holland Village last night. The ribs and steak were very good but the service was terrible. Always had to seek out wait staff to get another round of drinks. The margaritas were the worst I have ever tasted.

LARGE portions for carb loading! Very tasty. reasonably speedy service. Worthwhile eatery for a quick lunch.

I think best for the manager, chef, staff to get a set of ear plugs if he visits. Steak not as stated "AUSSIE"??Dont go there if thirsty as you will wait forever for a drink, also take a packed lunch while waiting fot the below average food. Also check bill for adding none served item

Food good but the restaurant has bitten off more than it can chew with its promise of Australian Beef Buffet . Would not invite my mate Gordon Ramsey here . Waited and waited not only for food drinks also; 30 minutes at times . However staff are friendly but unable to cope . The restaurant is fighting above its weight . No reflection on the staff but they have their work cut out . Kitchen is small

Been going to Barossa for a couple of years now. Location is Superb with many other restaurant, bar and also overlooking Marina Bay Sands. Also great place to come during New Year eve to watch the fireworks. I like the Aged Prime Beef Ribs best. Super value for a 600g steak. They also have a good selection of beer. The desert may not be their strength but there are other outlet you can visit after dinner for dessert around there

The waitress didn't seem to understand our questions and didn't know how to answer most of it when she finally did understand us. Had the lamb burger and what was supposed to be an angus ribeye steak cooked to medium. The lamb burger was SOOOooo gamey.. it tasted like old mutton I left about more than 1/3. This says a lot about a burger, I've never known myself not to finish one. My friend tried it (just to understand what I meant) and spat it out. I had to try to drown it in mustard to just finish what i could. Now the steak. I've bought, cooked and eaten many a ribeye steak and many an angus ribeye, that was firstly, a sirlion and not even ribeye. It was so chewy, my friend got tired eating it halfway through I ate the rest because i was still hungry as I couldn't eat the burger anymore. Then we asked for the bill. At the beginning we had already established we were entitled to one glass of wine (red or white). I didn't even have any cause but we had 1 glass. That charged us for it. If we hadn't looked at the bill, i'd have not noticed it. So the original bill was $100 for two people and 1 glass of wine. They took the wine out after we pointed out how we'd already established it was supposed to be free. What I did like - the fries that came with my burger.. great. Life saver also. The sauteed mushrooms that came with the steak not bad. But all that means, if I were you looking for a lamb burger and steak (it was a hefty $45!!).. ..this is definitely NOT the place for you. I'd never go back

Walking round Marina Bay, we stopped here for a quick drink and a spot of lunch. At midday on a Saturday the place is practically empty, so we got served quickly by our cheerful waitress. The salad we had was good, although a little bit heavy-handed on the mustard dressing. Coffee was quite mellow, and if you want a mojito at lunchtime on Saturday, this is a pleasant place to drink it

Utter gash - service is poor and the staff just arent interested.There are so many better bars in the area that stopping off here whether to watch a sporting event or enjoy the company of others just aint cool.This bar has little atmosphere or tone that to walk on by you wouldnt miss a thing
