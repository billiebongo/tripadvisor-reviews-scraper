Most of the nyonya dishes here are good, except that some of the selections on the menu may not be available at times. I had many dinners here. The braised pork, ayam buah keluak and the brinjal are recommended.

Read about this place in the media and decided to have dinner with a friend there. We had the Ngoh Hiang, Bak Wan kepeting and Assam fish. Overall, food is averagy but could have been better if the Assam fish gravy had been thicker and the soup more tasty. The meat balls and rolls were nothing great. Food was pricey for a joint sharing spaces with others, hence not exclusive. Not significant and comparable with other more authentic Peranakan places in the market.

Finding Peranakan food in Singapore is no easy task, and Baba Wins makes it real easy to savour hearty Peranakan food near central Singapore, as it was nestled on the 2nd floor of Tiong Bahru Plaza, just above Tiong Bahru MRT Station. Portions were generous and good for sharing for families.Baba Wins does a wicked rendition of Ayam Buah Keluak, a quintessential dish in Peranakan cuisine. Tender chicken chunks were marinated in rich Buah Keluak sauce, nutty with hints of cocoa. There were no hints of the actual black nut though - the owner Mr Winston explained that they source the paste from a supplier, where instead of the contents of just one nut, the tantalising gravy contains the equivalent of 4 Buah Keluak nuts. A fascinating textured and fragrant dish - highly recommended! We also tried Babi Pongteh, pure comfort food that goes best with rice. The black beauty is a celebration of succulent pork that is braised in fragrant tau cheo (fermented soybean paste). Far from photogenic, but incredibly savoury and delicious. For those who are up for some spice, the sambal brinjal topped with crispy shrimps was an interesting highlight (the layer of fresh chilli paste is guaranteed to make your tastebuds tingle!)Their Beef Rendang was good, but not particularly fork tender though. Though they have a small dessert menu, each item was very well prepared. We had the Pulut Hitam, a smooth black glutinous rice dessert laced with rich coconut milk. Swirl the milk in and you will be in dessert heaven! If you can't get to Malacca to try their gula melaka (palm sugar), their Sago Pudding with Gula Melaka is probably the next best option as they import the rich palm sugar from Malacca, resulting in a dessert that is bursting with a sinful caramel flavour. In summary, authentic Peranakan cuisine, friendly service and generous portions at Baba Wins

had a decent choice of dishes; not being a specialist i could not say whether the cuisine is better. was decent for us, with some dishes excellent (pork curry), the chicken kelua tasted different from other places i visited but good, the beef rendang was a tad less tasty than i remembered. food by itself would possibly earn 4*.most disappointing is the location in the plaza restaurant alley and eating on low grade table. service is indifferent. chatty enough lady who knew our friends but very basic all in all

The best way to eat Peranakan food is gather a group. We were a party of eight. We ordered ayam buah keluak, brinjal, squid, sambal prawns with petai, chincalok omelette,beef rendang, ngoh hiang, fried seasame wings and achar. And we ordered three different desserts that were on offer. Found the portions small like the ngoh hiang and fried wings and forgettable. The stars were the buah keluak, squid, prawns with petai, brinjal. Let me explain. Buah keluak was creamy, squid came with a sweet sauce, prawn were savoury and spicy and the brinjal offered some crunch. Add on some achar and sambal balachan and it's all yum yum. My idea of perfect bites. As for the desserts no big wow. I prefer the simplicity of sago pudding. Reminds me of my childhood when mum would make this dessert.Still think Baba Wins is worth the effort. It takes lots of time and care to produce such dishes. I discovered two of my guests were peranakan over lunch. I learnt about other dishes that are not cooked by the restaurants. Super excited to know that this meal has inspired more meals and hopefully a few cooking lessons. Bon appetite

I opened myself to chance walking down the food corridor on the second level of Tiong Bahru Plaza, deciding to have a late lunch after taking care of some business at the TB Central Plaza. I found my way to Baba Wins, a Peranakan (a unique Singaporean/Chinese/Malay culture) restaurant run by a husband/wife team. The menu offered two pages of traditional family recipes, two pages of "heritage" dishes, and some classic local dishes. I went with an afternoon lunch special on offer from 11-5pm of one main (chicken& tofu in salted fish curry), one veg (bringal or eggplant) rice + drink (lemongrass) + dessert (glutinous black rice w coconut cream). I would have taken better notes but the owner asked if he could join me as I'd expressed an interest in the menu and culture. We chatted all through the meal and I learned a lot about the origins of Peranakan culture. We talked about the very special Singaporean value of live-and-let-live regarding religion and food. My meal was delicious, well priced, and healthy. Spice level is about 4-5. They are very helpful in understanding the dishes so it's a great way to try something new! To get there simply take the East/West (Green) Line of the MRT(train). Then enter the mall and go to the second floor. Look for the food hall just off from the shops. There are several Ramen shops, Korean food, Bao and just about anything you could think of. But do stop into the Peranakan place. While you're there, take a look at their small art collection. My new word for the day: Tai-Tai (loosely translated: "Lady-Who-Lunches" )

Baba Wins is a family business. Winston is the boss and his wife helms the kitchen cooking up a storm with his mother's precious recipes. I love Peranakan food and it's hard to find good Peranakan food that is not home cooked in Singapore. We had a simple set lunch which didn't have a good presentation (a little too army camp with its partitioned tray).The set lunch comprises of a choice of main and vegetable and comes with rice, omelette, sambal, dessert and a drink (a selection to choose from)I was so excited to taste the fantastic ayam buah keluak (buah keluak is a nut which is the key ingredient to the flavour of this dish) I love love love this dish. It's all about the gravy for me. The chap chye (stewed mixed vegetables) and sambal brinjal (spicy fried eggplant) were pretty decent too.I had the Babi ponteh but I prefer the use of pork belly when rendered well is moist and melts in your mouth.After lunch, Winston came to introduce himself and share about the idea behind the eatery which was a lovely touch. (They were originally located at Star Vista. Don't go to the wrong location people.)Winston also introduced some specials they had. One was sambal buah keluak. (My kryptonite). I was too full from lunch but ordered some to take away and it was superb.SummaryBuah keluak dishes. Yes yes yes. Chap chye and sambal brinjal good enough. Ponteh flavour ok. Sambal buah keluak is not always on offer so call in a couple of days ahead to order.Would I come back to this Peranakan eatery? Definite yes. It's nearly impossible to find great buah keluak dishes. Great job Baba Winston for keeping these family recipes alive

Baba wins opened in tiong bahru plaza a few months ago but does not seem to be pulling in the crowd like other surrounding restaurants. They serve mainly dishes meant for sharing, which may deter the lunch crowd and young people out for a meal. Because of the nature of their dishes, they're also a little more expensive. We were served by, we presume, a line of family members (father, mother, son) who provided very good service and took time to explain the dishes to us. I found the food tasty. Not exceptional, but above average. Will try to come back again to see what else they have to offer

I visited Baba Wins recently and was pleasantly surprised by the authenticity of their Peranakan cuisine. Dining here brought me pleasant memories of the many delicious meals I enjoyed at my Peranakan grandmother's kitchen eons ago.The restaurant owner being a Peranakan, has faithfully replicated the dishes which hallmarked the tastes and flavors of this unique local culture. Some of the dishes I enjoyed were the Babi Pongteh, Steamed Seafood Otah, Sambal Bendi ( okrah ). I thought the Bakwan Kepiting was a little bland ( compared to my grandmother's ). The Sago dessert was yummy. In manpower starved Singapore it is quite normal to complain of poor service, but I could see that the owner and his staff gamely doing their best to handle the large crowds that converged during dinner. I thought that their pricing represented good value. I will definitely come back again

I have heard a lot about this restaurant and we went there to celebrate a friend's birthday. I would rate the service as very good but the food is average.The braised meat, or babi sio is too sweet for our taste and the chinchalok omelette is too salty. The brinjal baked with sambal chilli was a recommendation by the owner. This was a bad selection because we found the dish not palatable. The food is not that great but the service was good.The owner was very friendly and took time to explain to us how each dish is prepared. He even gave a very meaningful birthday dessert to my friend and explain the full meaning of wishing him a long and sweet life filled with wealth in an egg in this dish
