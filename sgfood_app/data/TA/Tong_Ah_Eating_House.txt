Brought my Korean friends here and they love it! I really like their steamed bread. The other three are equally good.
However , the downside is that they don't state the price. So I don't even know if I was overcharged or not.

Open at 6.30 am, very good cold coffee with condense milk, worth to try kaya toast. Suitable to go for breakfast and tea time.

This place was quite near to where I have stayed during my one day layover at Singapore.I saw many locals going to and fro to this restaurant and it piqued my interest.Going inside is like being taken back in time. It's like a family business where everyone does their own chores. It felt like old Singapore, not that I know how old Singapore was like but it felt calmer and i've felt detached from the hustle and bustle of Singapore even just for a while.The kaya toast, soft boiled eggs and the coffee were just ok, nothing fancy. Well worth the 5 bucks the old man immediately collected before I ate.It would be a great waste if these kinds of restaurants and shops were to be replaced by modern and chic ones. So go out and support your local shops. It's more fun when you help preserve your culture

I work in the area and visited this place a few times, at different parts of the day. First visit- late Saturday night in July 2017- three of us- zi char, dine in- food was ok, on the oily side, service was averageSecond visit- lunchtime on a weekday in Aug 2017- solo- fish soup noodles, takeaway- food was ok, but the staff who served me was very rude. My food was left on the counter for the longest time. Despite the fact that the kitchen staff kept ringing the bell to get her attention, the staff simply ignored it and continued talking to the aunties at the nearest table. When I finally lost my patience and told her that my food was ready, she told me (in the most disinterested way) to wait and then resumed her conversation with the aunties. It was another staff who eventually noticed that I had been waiting for quite a while and packed my food for me.Third and forth visit- evening on a weekday in Jan 2017- solo- toasts and beverage, takeaway- the toasts were pre toasted and re toasted upon ordering. They were quite good - crispy and slightly burnt on the outside. However, the uncle (owner, I supposed) handled both the toasts and money (and everything actually) with his bare hands. Not exactly hygienic

I came to Tong Ah for Kaya toasts based on the recommendations found online. Turns out those recommendations are good ones. Their Kaya toast with eggs are tasty. I personally don't like Kaya too sweet but theirs are just well in sweetness. The milk tea is tasty and thick

Kaya was pretty disappointing to be honest. True, it's not disgusting sweet like other famous brands but I couldnt really taste the fragrance of the kaya. It was really bland and its almost as if I was just having butter toast. The chinese national waitresses didnt seem too patient either. Personally I think this place is overhyped

Was recommended by a friend and was really pleased with the food. Very friendly and helped us order as we didn't really know what we wanted.  All very good and tasty, the price was reasonable too! The dishes we had were coffee ribs and fragrant chicken, both were amazing. Would highly recommend for a no frills taste of Singapore.

This is the place where you can get very traditional Singapore breakfast! Ice coffee was really good and the traditional kaya toast with 2 eggs. And at fist I thought it will be just good but I love it so much and went there for breakfast everyday during our 3 days in Singapore
4
ordered two kaya french toast with kopi c and teh c and nasi lemak for sharing. their soft boiled egg was nearly to perfect. their kaya french toast was really great too! but.. the nasi lemak fails me. the rice is not really fragrant as the other nasi lemak, and the ikan bilis is only for a pinch. their kopi and teh : good. eight outta ten

This is a very unassuming, simple, traditional cafe in a very gentrified part of Chinatown. Basic service, basic English, no frills, cheap - but if you want to try the traditional quick Singaporean breakfast this is the place.Kopi (coffee with condensed milk), kaya toast, soft boiled eggs and not much else served in plastic plates and chipped cups (and following Singapore traditions no napkins).Unsurprisingly it is very popular with locals - so it is also very good to have a glimpse into local life

first time here,sit a while and found nobody serve even there's a menu on table.take order at counter and they asked for payment before the food served.ordered set of toast , kaya toast and coffee is good ,traditional meal for breakfast.
3
Went in for a quick bite since this is supposed to an icon in Singapore.
The only thing good is the service. Kaya Toast and Kopi were just ok.
Nothing special to mention.
5
Great coffee & tea mix drink. My favorite with sift boil eggs and thinly sliced toasted bread.
Dinner - ask for chef specialities. Ate here numerous times and they have items not on the menu.

Been in here a few times recently after eating lunch at nearby restaurants in order to get a local tea. It gets fairly busy at lunchtime but usually it's possible to squeeze in somewhere. The tea is pretty standard and the service is reasonably efficient.
4
My first time here, and was surprised that it was empty on a weekday afternoon. After checking that it was open, I ordered a traditional kaya toast + iced teh C. Bread was perfect and I saw him make it with iced butter. Tea was rich and tasty. Only flaw was that the place was bit warm and stuff

If you know Tong Ah (东亚), you'll probably know its long history and it being one of the oldest if not oldest kopitiam (coffeeshop) in Singapore. (The original building still carries the Chinese words 东亚）However, the owner has already moved its operations across the streets. But although the location has changed, the management is still the same and the name stays the same as well. And most importantly, the aromatic kopi (coffee) stayed the same too!Always a good place to wind down in between errands or a quick bite. Their 'zichar' (cooked food) is also great. Remember to try their steam "Song" fishhead, their big prawn noodles and their roasted pork (烧肉) fried rice. They're good

We visited this place after several recommendations that this place does one of the best Kaya Toast in Singapore. The place was quite when we arrived and was seated right away. It's basic and clean. We was given a kaya toast menu only (which was confusing as the sign says it's a seafood restaurant so must have other menus). We ordered the set with tea, it was served milky and sweet just how we like it. The toast and eggs was delicious and while we have no complaints the high recommendations are overrated in our opinion, you can get just as nice, perhaps nicer, kaya toast at other places in Singapore. We went on a kaya toast breakfast spree for the rest of our holiday after trying it here, even purchased several jars (not from here we didn't notice if it was sold here but other restaurants do sell it for home consumption) so we can continue to have it at home. Worth a visit if you are in the area

Much can be read online about this coffee shop which -I've been told- is iconic for this street nearby Chinatown. Although it serves much more, do try the kaya toast with a cup of local coffee, get one of the two small tables outside - and enjoy the neighborhood atmosphere

Came here for breakfast because it was recommended by search engines, also it was a 1 min walk from our hotel. The owner was making the food, while one woman was serving customers. I got my coffee both on the cup and the saucer. The cup was swimming in spilled coffee on the saucer, which I didn't mind but being quite a cleanliness freak, I wanted to do something to clean it up. It felt like the staff was impatient towards tourists. Good thing I can speak Chinese, or I don't know how we could have interacted. The place didn't offer napkins, so try to be careful when you're eating your Kaya toast and eggs

This is the first time i've come to Tong Ah Kopi Tiam (coffee shop). Tong Ah, like the article on a newspaper said "A Ritual for Starting the Day in Singapore" was very popular for Singaporean, especially who lives at the China Town neighbourhood. Maybe we are not coming at the correct time (at 21.00 PM), when they prepare for closing, but they still served us well. We ordered coffee, milk coffee with condensed milk and tea, plus kaya toast and half boiled eggs. Tong Ah serve dark roasted robusta coffee like the other oriental coffee shop. Really strong coffee with a bold body and full of caffeine for sure. We love their Kaya Toast and the half boiled eggs. Unfortunately i can't chit chat with the owner, since we have the same bussiness, hope i can meet him other time

This is my first time visit Tong AH Eating House, I was staying hotel nearby and wanting to look for something local for my breakfast. The food is really nice!!! Will definitely return to the same shop when I travel to SIngapore again.

Wonderful breakfast of local food. Bustling and noisy and great! Full of local people. You'll need to take your own napkin!
3
nice kaya toast however inside the shop 2 big metal fans full blast very annoying makes the atmosphere not
so good place to dine
4
Slightly pushy for more expensive items other wise great place for family dining. Good place for coffee and toast too!

We popped i. Here for coffee after lunch at the neighbouring Taratata Bistrot, and actually enjoyed the snacks here even better than our lunch.The coffee was thick, well roasted and strong, while the tea was almost as good. We ordered a plate of butter toast and it was delicious! The bread was puffy from the toasting and the butter had some sugar in it as it had a great crunch. We enjoyed it so much that we ordered a second portion.This place is popular, especially with tourists as we saw a number of groups queuing outside waiting for tables

Singapore , the real national breakfast is a plate of kaya toast (sweet custard )with some runny-yolked soft-cooked eggs topped with white pepper and dark soy sauce. If you're the type of person to spend your mornings dragging toast through pools of egg yolk, this is the thing for you
5
Loved their Kaya Toast and Soft Boiled eggs! I order 2 sets every morning when I'm there. Not really a fan of the Nasi Lemak, it's good but they partner it with soft boiled eggs instead of fried eggs. They serve good, strong, flavorful coffee. If you are not used to the typical Chinese coffee house set up and customer service, you might find it a bit queer. But that is how it is in. The owner / cook is a very nice man. The women are a bit on the "tougher" side, but they mean well. I guess they are shocked that I get to order 2 sets when I'm not that big for an Asian lady

Sure this place is (relatively) old school and is able to draw the nostalgic card but that can only get you so far. The drinks/breakfast counter people in the front don't talk to the cooked food people at the back of the coffeeshop and you're basically left on your own- pick your side or prepared to be ignored. So we ordered 3 dishes from the back and they came quickly. Taste wasn't too bad, it was inexpensive but also very greasy. Not a terrible place in an over gentrified, over priced street but just don't expect cheap & cheerful. Probably cheap and good enough.

Apparently this is a very famous place for old school toast and coffee cus is been around for more than 40 years or so. Nothing much bout the food, probably just hard to find any kopitiams in SG that has such old school layout.Btw, great place for picture takings. vintage is the word to describe that area.

Though Tong Ah is a seafood restaurant, it is a great place to also have non-seafood dishes. Local favorites like hor fun and hokkien mee are just $5 a plate - and given how good it is - this is terrific value for money. It remains a local outpost fighting against the creeping gentrification of the Keong Saik area
