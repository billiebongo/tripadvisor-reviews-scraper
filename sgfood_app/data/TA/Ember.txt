The Ember is the 1929 Hotel's restaurant which offers a great breakfast and lunch specials which look excellent. Highly recommended
5
One of the better restaurant that I have been to. Lunch is especially worth it. Probably would not be great as a romantic dinner location as there are a lot of echo from the glass panels.

Ember is one of those restaurants I've been back to many, many times over the years. I always like come here for lunch as they have a really good set menu for 32++. Although I must say I much prefer their old menu from the previous chef as they had more options to choose from. Also for the first time, my risotto was undercooked. The steak on the other hand was top notch as were the desserts
4
Business lunch here. Set menu was simple (three choices each of starter, main and dessert) but well though through. Food was delicious although a hungry person may find the portions on the small side. Service was OK although our server struggled with basic English and our order had to be repeated a couple of times. Was good enough however to want to return

Dreadful service .. wine by the glass undrinkable and treated as a joke .. Oysters were good but decided to leave after that as it was a special christmas lunch and we couldn't even have a glass of decent wine .. Ive known this restaurant for many years and i will never go back .

The restaurant has limited dishes, but they are all very good for the price you pay. I prefer eating there during lunch as it is a lot worth it. The menu does not deviate much from a dinner menu, but the price does. From the hot delicious sundried tomatoes bread to the desserts. It is served with lots of love from the owner. I would warn that your steak should not be more than medium done.... anything more.... the kitchen will not be happy and you might as well be eating roast meat

Restaurant Ember has quite a good reputation but a lunch there recently seemed to point up the worst aspects of nouvelle cuisine.It's quite good to have smallish portions at lunch-time but there are limits.The angel hair Pasta starter was small and tasteless.The main course of venison was a tiny piece of quite tasty meat served with very hard wild rice and a tiny portion of a vegetable artfully arranged.The dessert was a tiny chocolate brownie sort of thing with a sliver of banana flavoured ice-cream on top.The bread was good though.As for the wine which we ordered by the glass,they did not have the stated one so we took their advice on an Australian Pinot Noir.It was not very good.Annoyingly they served this in a tiny quantity as well,stating this was a standard measure.At $16 a glass it seemed very bad value for money.As did the total bill at S$242 for two

This place has survived the fickle Singapore dining scene which in itself is a notable feat! While a bit on the salty side, each dish was beautifully presented and really delicious. We had the set dinner and really enjoyed the palate cleansers too. Lovely all in all! We will be bac

Adore. Divine. I have no more superlatives. Superb food and great service. A chill lunch place with a expertly-culled set lunch menu. Off street parking was a breeze at lunch - why is 1929's in-house restaurant not more packed? Went to town with the foie gras (simply delectable), ebi pasta, chicken (perfectly baked) and a selection of deserts. My companion and I couldn't have been happier. We will certainly be back in a month! Keep up the great work, Unlisted

Popped in here today for a quick lunch. I had the venison which, whilst well presented and generally tasty, was a bit too chewy for my liking. Not sure I'll rush back here.
3
The bread served was warm and good. Main meal of pasta was ok. Chocolate lava cake for dessert. It was ok overall but I was expecting better quality of food for the price paid.
5
Had a great dining experience at Restaurant Ember - great quality food with excellent attentive service. highly recommended
3
ember used to be great value for a lunch escapade. however new menu meant that it no longer offers value for money as a set lunch. food seems to be disappointing with a new chef helming it. reckon they have lost many of us regular diners
5
We very much enjoyed our meal here. The ambience was quiet and comfortable and there were sufficient people eating there even on a Tuesday evening to make us feel good about being there. The unusually warm foie gras with Asian five spices was a melt in the mouth experience, the venison was perfectly medium rare and the lemongrass and lime parfait was gorgeous. Our only complaint is the usual one for Singapore - the hugely expensive cost of wine. My glass of Chianti was excellent but when, despite the price, I asked for a second Chianti I was told I'd had the last one. However the waiter returned with the remnants of an excellent chateau wine - on the house. A very nice touch and much appreciated. Food prices while dear are, given their exceptional quality, very good value when compared with Sydney prices. Well worth a visit.

Ember was the best dining experience I had on my short vacation in Singapore. It compares favourably to good restaurants in Australia. We had dined at several Michelin hatted restaurants in Europe on the first leg of our vacation and were finding most Singaporean offers to be sub-standard lukewarm bain-marie smorgasbord fare. (Buffet appears to pass for good dining in Singapore.) We were overjoyed to find Ember. The menu is limited, but each dish was balanced, delicate and executed perfectly. The staff were attentive and friendly. We enjoyed a wine flight to accompany the degustation and these matched the dishes very well. Chef introduced some dishes to us also, which is a great touch

We have been faithful patrons of this restaurant since we were introduced to it by a friend. This was when Ember was managed by its original owner/chef. Food and service were good. We have even brought friends there and they in turn introduced others to the place.There was then a change of management or owner, hence, the chef changed as well. The menu remained pretty similar and we still enjoyed coming in for dinner to celebrate special occasions like birthdays. This was what we did yesterday to celebrate our son's birthday. To be honest, it was my husband's idea to bring the family to Ember as he had recently read about the new menu/chef and had been eager to give it a try. We have not been back here for awhile too and thought it a brilliant idea to get re-acquainted with Ember all over again.The menu had very limited selections and we pretty much ordered all of its main courses. There was no beef dish on offer which was a tad odd and disappointing to my boys. Given what we could order, the dish we enjoyed the most was the Sakura Ebi pasta. The rest of what we ordered like the sea bass, pork belly, venison, Angel hair pasta, duck leg, scallops etc were alright but not amazing. My husband also ordered some oysters which he said was nice. The bread and butter they provided was lovely but it was a little odd as we were asked to share out 3 small pieces of bread amongst our family of 5 as each piece was meant for 2 persons. Upon us asking for more bread, we were told that they would provide 2 more pieces on the house which was a nice gesture.My main gripe about the evening other than the extremely limited choice of food on the menu was the lack of service. It seemed very difficult to get anyone's attention when the staff were so busy attending to the other patrons. Every table was occupied and I can imagine how busy they were but with only 3 servers including the manager, the place was screaming for additional help. I don't think the servers were deliberately ignoring us but we could see them trying to rush to attend to everyone all at once. In between each course, there was a long lull and it was only after getting the attention of the manager that our food arrived. Although it was not evident to us sitting outside, could there be a shortage of staff in the kitchen as well?The restaurant was nice enough to provide a complimentary Creme brûlée on the house for my son's birthday but alas, that came a tad too late as I was just eager to get out of there by then. We also had 2 other desserts.It is a pity that we had a disappointing evening and I am not sure that we will reconsider visiting the establishment again. Let's hope that our experience last night was one isolated case and many people did enjoy themselves last night and will continue to take pleasure in what Ember has to offer

Came back to Ember for lunch this week after a gap of a few years. Opted for the set lunch and chose the fois gras, pork belly and the creme brûlée. The fois gras was good but the pork belly and the creme brûlée were both disappointing. No issues with the service but the quality of the food could be better
1
Read from some reviews from bloggers like ladyironchef but seems that the review is certainly overrated. Too expensive for low quality food sold at a high price "pseudo-fine dining". $30++ for notso tasty food with horrible service.Had set lunch but the Service was atrocious. We were in rush of time and reminded the waiter of that.Asked for chamomile tea and when the tea came in a glass the waiter subsequently gave another conical flask with tea inside without explaining what's going on.Had to remind the waiter if there's any bread but he said it's coming, until after we have finished the dessert, then the waiter said sorry forgotten about the bread. Plus only gave one piece even though there were 2 of us. Purposely left the bills at the counter and did other stuff knowing I was in a rush of time and I had to go over the counter to sign my credit card bill. Never heard of such lousy service in a restaurant that claims to be providing fine dining

I went several times at Ember for lunch and was never disappointed all the contrary. This is one of my favourite French cuisine place in Singapore and has the right pricing for it. The waiters are kind and efficient, the bread is freshly baked and reminds me of Paris style petits pains with light spice flavors. The Foie gras poêlé was just right and the fish main as the desserts were délicieux!I will go back without a doubt.I have not tasted the wines though, otherwise I have trouble keeping awake in the afternoon at the office..

Have been to this place many times previously. Realised the standard has dropped a lot. Was rather disappointing.
4
Good set lunch; reasonable choices, good service. Shame it was a little quiet, but for lunch it is a little out of the way (but worth the trip!). the '36 hour' duck confit was excellent! Superb.
4
All dishes were presented neatly and nicely. Particular love the bread and butter! The appetizers, main course and desserts were delicious! Portion was just right! Staff were friendly and attentive! A cosy place to chill, relax and let your hair down!
3
to keep to short. food wise still up to standard. but the service has dropped. i feel that they are now doing it for the sake of doing so, unlike the past.
5
Great value for continental cuisine. For $39 for a set including foie gra, main and dessert, you have no excuse to complain.I had the barramundi, egg and portobello and cheese and crackers and it turned out to be memorable. The duck comfit which I pinched from my guests tasted a bit dry and the other guest s steak was sizeable and cooked just right.The service was first class from Andy and he went the extra mile to take care of our needs esp. taking of photos of a special occasion. Do tip or compliment when you are given exceptional service esp when tipping is not compulsory in Singapore cos of service tax
5
Brought our sleeping toddler for a birthday lunch for my wife. Very attentive staff and great food! The flexibility of $29 2-course lunch and $39 3-course lunch also allowed us to mix and match which two dishes we want from the starters, main or desserts.My wife ordered the foie gras for starters and barramundi for main, while I ordered the steak for main and lava cake for dessert. The mix allowed us to have a decent lunch without over-filling ourselves. Costs about $100 with the wine included. Something I'd gladly pay twice the amount.Some of the staff's conversations about customers could be heard as we were sitting beside the counter. Could be a bit more tactful about that though
5
My husband and I loved the food. There was a Japanese twist to most of it. We liked how the restaurant was classy but not too uptight. A wonderful experience. First time doing wine pairing, and it was pretty good value for money.My favorite was the capellini. And that throw-in of an extra pineapple/coconut dessert was a nice surprise. The 10% discount (because of a Citibank tie-up I think) too
3
It used to be one of my go-to restaurants for celebrations and a for-sure good meal. For some reason (new management and new chef, perhaps?), it has become mediocre at best. They used to have the best braised pork belly in town, but it's gone from the menu. Not being a fan of red meat, I wanted the Bouillabaisse but was told it was not available (on a Friday night? especially when there're only 6 mains to choose from, with 4 being red meat). The only other choice was fish with fennel (fennel doesn't really work with fish, guys). Dessert of fig cheesecake fared a little better, although my companion was not impressed.It's a pity I have to take this place off my list of celebratory places now. You win some, you lose some

Stepped into Ember without any greeting and for a moment I thought I was in a fish market. The place was rowdy, the opposite of what I had expected. When we got seated, the staff gave us the menu and placed the utensils in such a haste. Strike one.Here’s what we ordered (3-course set lunch @ $28++): Mesclun Salad w prawns: Very ordinary. Something I could have whipped up in 10minPan-seared Foie Gras : DecentDuck Confit: Decent. I don’t wish to compare but Saveur does it better.Stockyard Sirloin: It came with what looked like overcooked/burnt mushrooms on top of my steak. Strike two. Besides that, everything else was average. Steak was done according to my request so I’ll let this go.Deconstructed cheesecake: Taste was one note, didn’t like it that much. Thought it was missing that lemony flavour. Looks wise it was very pretty but honestly taste matters more to me.Peach Clafoutis w vanilla ice cream: $28++ for set lunch isn’t expensive but for a fine place like Ember with raving reviews, you wouldn’t expect them to have canned peaches in their food. It just cheapens the entire dish. Vanilla ice cream tasted like Magnolia’s.Overall, very average food for $28++ and service was abysmal. There was a fruit fly hovering around my table the whole time before it got stuck to my fork. And fruit flies are usually a sign of a dirty environment. Strike three
5
My friends and I have been "regulars" , meaning coming here twice a year in the last 8 years. 10 of us gathered here again and all ordered the 4 course set. I usually go for the hamachi sashimi and capellini which are always good. Tried the wagyu for 2 at a supplement of $75. Our medium turned out medium rare, which was ok. The deconstructed cheesecake was just okOverall good food and service and we even got a 10% discount

Good food & great service! Good value for the dinner set and decent wine list with reasonable price.

- Situated in Hotel 1929, a boutique hotel along Keong Saik Road.
- Quiet, refined, comfortable.
- Food prepared with care and attention, very good presentation
- Personable service
- Ideal for business lunches or an intimate dinner.
4
Ember may not be Michelin star level yet but the food while simple is delicious. Pricing is fairly affordable as well.
4
Very good food with a friendly and professional service. We had the four courses suggestion with accompanying wines. Though it was a bit pricey overall a very good experience.
4
Really cosy place with great food and service and while the price is rather steep it's worth the money.

Little quantity, funny presentation of food, not a fine dining restaurant service.We both order a 4 set menu course with two starter, one main course and one dessert.The size of the starter is very small and ok. Me and my boyfriend order the the duck and Sakura Eli that the quantity is smaller than a lady palm size.In additional, I have heard the first time that ordering some more bread is charging you every piece of additional bread with SG$2.50 more!!!!I personally run a fine dining restaurant before, and we serve the bread is free flow!!!!! I think most of you will agree with me on this point.The main dish I chose the beef cheeks.My boyfriend choose the quail, which is one of the famous dish over there.The taste and quantity is adequate.Both of us choose the choco parfait which for our dessert, taste wise fine. At last, the waiter service is not as fine dining quality. It looks like cafeteria serving fast food. They won't recall the dish name to remind you what you have order or intro a bit of the dishes again.You can hear the cooking sound with woks and pans .... EtcDishes are serve in a very slow pace.

2nd visit to ember today and it definitely wasn't as pleasant and satisfying as the 1st. Had wanted to order the bouillabaisse but they failed to inform that it wasn't available till our orders were taken. Shouldnt the staff be briefed to inform diners what weren't available upon presenting the menu?Menu has changed and barramundi with clam gravy and caviar was sadly replaced by a very tough coral trout dish. When i first inserted my fork, i was even wondering if it was fully cooked. I've tried ocean trout but not coral trout, and i wasn't aware that the difference in the 2 is so great. Ocean trout tasted more like salmon, more to my liking. Coral trout was...tough. The emulsified butter sauce was supposed to have sea urchin but i tasted none. It's a waste of my calories, bring back the previous barramundi please.Secondly, their wagyu was for 2 (400g) but they offered my husband half the portion during our first visit. Sadly this time round we were rejected. They should give diners the option of 200g/400g. I wonder how many slabs of 400g they have in their kitchen as a result of their refusal to be flexible with the serving size.Only saving grace was the dessert, tasted still as great. but i felt it was poorly plated, when it was served, i saw nothing but lotsa biscuit crumbs and flowers. Will i return again? Definitely not on the top of my list anymore.

Had lunch at Ember and found the lunch sets quite reasonable considering the upscale menu items. My friends and I each ordered the pan grilled sirloin with mushrooms and we all enjoyed it. I chose the pumpkin soup with bacon as my first course and it along with the bread were my favorites of the meal. The bread wasn't plain and white; really had a delicious flavor. Soup was rich and creamy with a nice pumpkin flavor. The staff was friendly and responsive. We had to be somewhere at 2:00 and needed ample time to find the place we were walking to, so when we finished our entrees and needed to get dessert out quickly, I asked our server who accommodated us. Then when I went wandering around looking for the rest room and one of the restaurant saw me looking lost and showed me where to go. All in all, I thought Ember was cozy and charming and would definitely go back

We dined as a group of four on Friday night. We arrived at 8.30pm and had a nice meal spending around $600 between us. It was an enjoyable experience until the end. At 10.30pm while we were finishing our wine and coffees the waiter presented us with our bill even though we hadn't asked for it then promptly stood with his hands on his hips staring at us. We settled the bill and proceeded to finish our wine and coffee but the waiter continued standing by our table staring at us, sighing and opening the door. It was clear he wanted to shut up shop and that we were no longer welcome. It made the four of us feel very uncomfortable. Having arrived at 8.30pm for a 4 course meal to be promptly made to feel uncomfortable and unwelcome by 10.30pm was really outrageous given the amount of money we spent here. I hope no other customers have to go through this unprofessional ordeal. It was upsetting to end our night this way

Dined with friends on a Friday night. Very good experience all round. Just formal enough to be special, without being stuffy, lively without being loud. Very good service, friendly, knowledgable about the menu, present without hovering, clearly well trained and well managed. Overall this restaurant is great for friends or for business.Ate the 4 course set menu with wine pairings. Just lovely.Starter of mushroom consommé was superb - great depth of flavour. Scallop carpaccio served on lovely Japanese ceramic plates with a fresh Asian taste, beautiful flavours.Next course - foie gras was lovely as was the pasta with shrimps. Again served on different character of plates to suit the food - a nice touch which really added an extra something to the experience.Main course also good - barramundi was lovely, not smothered with unnecessary flavour, letting the quality of the ingredients shine through. The slow cooked dinner (60hours!!!) beef rib was melting and flavoursome, really delicious. Lamb also good.Deserts were ok - deconstructed cheesecake, and a brownie. All very nice - but we all agreed that the first three courses stood out as truly delicious gastronomy, whereas dessert was just very good!Wine pour (3 glasses with top ups) paired very well with the food and was good value (by Singapore standard!) at usd3
4
We went for dinner and enjoyed the 4 course set menu with paired wines for an additional $30. Great value and exceptional food. Service was fabulous too. Highly recommended.
5
Portion looks small but do not be fooled. I have been coming back yearly for anniversaries. Changed of management happened however standards remains high!
4
We were looking for a place for dessert and coffee/wine after our dinner. The embience was really relaxing and quiet. We ordered 2 dessert to share and both were excellent...can always trust Ember on their dessert !! Yum!
4
The set menu is good value. I recommend the mushroom consomme, lobster starter, pan-roasted barramundi, and cheese platter.
4
Stepping into this restaurant, one feels like you are invited into an intimate dining space. The configuration of the restaurant meant that tables are laid out in two tiers. Warm lighting and velvet-lined chairs give diners a feeling of luxury and comfort.Dinner choices were either from the set or ala carte menus. My partner and I opt for the ala carte dishes as the choices in the set menu did not suit us well. A key word highlighted each dish on the menu accompanied with detailed descriptions of the dish. We ordered the carpaccio, consommÃ© (starters), barramundi, duck (mains), figs and chocolate (desserts). All the dishes were creatively presented, compliments to Chef Sufian. The portions, especially the mains; were fairly large.The service team members were hospitable, especially Andy. He made our dinner experience all the more enjoyable with his banter. Great job
4
Well worth the $42 for a delicious 3-course meal served promptly so we managed to finish in just over an hour. The warm fragrant bread served raised our expectations of a good meal and we weren't disappointed. I had the mushroom cappuccino, an amazing oven-roasted French poulet and a delectable chocolate fondant with banana and milk ice-cream. Service was attentive and helpful.
5
This is my second visit in three weeks. They have good 3 course set lunch at $42. I have the soup, tenderloin and chocolate fondant. My family had the sashimi salad and foie gras as starter. Food is consistently good. We love the tenderloin. The meal ends wellwith superb dessert. The portions are big and the champagne jelly, deconstructed cheesecake as well as chocolate fondant are excellent. They serve free garlic bread as starter. These are so good that we ordered the bread(besides some pasta) for takeaway although it is quite pricey at $2plus per piece. Will be back. The restaurant manager Clarence is friendly and attentive. The staffs are well trained which makes the dining experience very pleasant.
4
Being a wagyu steak lover, i've always have high expectations especially at mid to high end restaurants.I ordered two set dinner and "upgraded" my mains to wagyu ribeye at medium doneness. However, when the steak came, one side of it was almost rare and had to ask the waiter to grill again. The grade of beef was probably the middle range. Despite the wagyu grade, i thought the taste could be better. Nevertheless, the appetizer, 1st main, and dessert was good. The service staff were nice and polite too.
5
Been there for the 3rd time and again was impressed. Their lunch menu is very well priced and the food was simply outstanding. 3 courses served in 1 hour and amazing food. The 36hour duck leg confit was simply one of the best things i have eaten in a long time. Suculent and crisp on the outside with a delicious puree and vegetables......would sure go back for more. Great place , awesome food and good service with great knowledge of the menu
4
Went there for lunch and we decided to order three different main causes so that we can try as much as possible. For starter I had the Hokkaido salad which was good. My friend had the foie gras which could have been better if it had been crispier and pan fried slightly longer. For the main, the duck was really good, meat was soft and skin was crispy. The seafood risotto was good and so was the pan fried Barramundi. Dessert was chocolate lava cake. Will go again
3
Had a nice dinner here with some friends, food was alright though we would have preferred it if there was more focus on the natural flavours of the food.
All in all an OK experience for a mid-high price range restaurant.
4
Finally made it to Ember for their set-lunch. Service was attentive and not overbearing.Appetisers and desserts were very good; especially their desserts. Mains however not so great. Not bad - acceptable, but no wow factor.One point is that I would really like to try the dinner menu, especially the Bouillabaisse.
4
My 1st time back since the owner/chef packed up and left. 80% of the old menu seemed to be intact, but some favorites like the seabass are gone. Other favorites remainThere is a choice of a 4 course set or a la carte for dinner. The set is a good deal for $88Started with the scallop carpaccio , and then the ebi capellini , both from the old menu. Solid and tasty. Had the barramundi for main and it was ok. Eyed my friends' wagyu steak and beef ribs, both looked way better than my fish. For dessert I had the cheese platter. My friend's champagne jelly didn't wow but the deconstructed cheesecake of another looked goodOverall good food but not overly creative. Good service als
4
Came to this restaurant in its earlier day. I must say the restaurant has a classier and better menu now. Came in a group of 4.3 of us had a set dinner. 2 of us chose wine pairing. Each set dinner has 4 courses. I had Carpacio Hokkaido Scallop, Maine Lobster in Lobster broth, Wagyu stirloin beef with Wasabi Dip (min for 2 people), Chocolate brownie with peanut butter and Coffee. All my courses were delicious. Kudos to the local chef.The downside was the restaurant was a little on the noisy side and pokey. Other than those two, the rest more than made up for them
4
It was my first visit to Ember even though it has been around since 2002, and houses a lovely ambience exuding comfort, cosiness and intimacy all in one.The Mushroom Consomme (SGD$16.00), a clear dark soup looking like chicken essence, containing shimeji mushrooms and tortellinis of chicken and foie gras. The sapid, nearly-sharp taste of mushrooms of this soup made for a fabulous stomach-warmer. The tortellinis melted in the mouth readily, making one yearn for more.The Bouillabaisse (SGD$32.00), a classic provencal French seafood stew. Maybe I have a sweeter tooth than that of my fellow reviewers, but I loved this dish with its a la lobster-bisque broth, elemental of sweetness, savoury and creamy tones all intact. The langoustine, Hokkaido scallops, seabass and clams were all fresh and springy, a satisfying treat for seafood lovers.The Duo of Duck (SGD$32.00) consisting of Duck Confit and Duck wrapped in phyllo. The duck confit was succulent but I actually prefer its counterpart wrapped thinly in crispy pastry. The flavour was heavier, but the crackling outer-layer combined with tender flesh had another level of appeal on its own.For desserts, we began with Valrhona Chocolate Brownie (SGD$18.00), served with peanut butter parfait, walnuts and bananas was good. The brownie was moist and rich in taste; the peanut butter parfait was tasty, and the bananas complemented the denser dessert well enough.Following that, we had the Champagne Jelly (SGD$16.00), served with macerated strawberries and yogurt sorbet. I admit that my preference is biased when it comes to alcoholic desserts - so this definitely rocked my boat. I enjoyed the light touch of champagne taste in wobbly form, as well as the accompaniments of tarty strawberries and refreshing sorbet.Finally, Pistachio (SGD$15.00) - sponge and ice-cream of pistachio, flower petals, crumble and ginger milk foam. I enjoyed the fluffy pistachio sponge and the ice-cream, both resplendent of pistachio's unique taste, enjoyed the crunch of the crumble and the gentle touch of the ginger milk foam that felt like a caress upon the lips.For full review and more detailed inforamtion, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2015/07/media-invite-restaurant-ember-hotel.htm

5
Have been there since they started, still getting great food and top class service. Particularly liked the professional response when my invited friend tried to pay for the meal. The lunch was a gastronomical experience with a sensual scallop salad that tickles your taste senses, the cod was superbly blended with a tangy vegetable potato mash and totally satisfied with the chocolate volcano cake with baked banana and vanilla ice cream. After thatrefreshing lunch break, had a good full afternoon without feeling overly full and sleepy.

We had dinner at Restaurant Ember on a Saturday evening. The restaurant was full. Food was very good, especially the short ribs which we had for our main course. It was done perfectly; tender and juicy. The bread, which was served fresh and hot was excellent; we had quite a few servings. Service was also pretty good and cosy. The only "negative" is that this is a rather small restaurant which means that tables are close to each other.
5
Myself and a few colleagues were there on Tues for an impromptu dinner after our initial location was unavailable. The restaurant housed in a chic hotel by the hip stretch of Chinatown was cosy with its soft furnishings but also elegant.Service was discreet yet attentive which made me feel like I was drinking from a perpetually filled glass. There was a moment of reservation about the food as I had a feeling that they were serving fine French (aka small expensive food) but the food being modern European with Asian influences were stunning and packed plenty of interesting ingredients and flavors especially that of Japanese cooking which comes at no surprise as the head Chef hails from acclaimed Iggy's and Waku Ghin which was a great surprise. We ordered from the sets which provided great value offering a 4-course set selection with hot beverage coupled with warm bread rolls and a petit four but we shared everything in the end. Highlights of the meal were the Ebi Cappelini, the braised short rib and definitely the brownie with peanut butter (heavenly!). Another highlight was a visit by the Chef Suffian to our table. The malay native shared with us his culinary journey and was extremely humble despite his illustrious career which effectively propelled our meal from good to great
5
We went there after a long break because there was a special set menu with Norwegian seafood. (1) The food was good, interesting but not unforgettable. I enjoyed every course so it was good and would recommend it. At $120 it was tremendous value for money - i think at least 5 or 6 courses. (2) for an additional $50 it came with wine-pairing. That's four or five glasses of wine. On top of that the waiter was so sweet, he topped up additional prosecco for me at the beginning - I didn't ask for it. I would come again.
5
Definitely one of the best value-for-money restaurants in Singapore, esp their lunch set but it does get rather noisy as ambience is definitely not their selling point.
4
After hearing so much good reviews on Ember, decided to try their set lunch on 27-Jan. We ordered their signature CrispyTofu with foie gras and steamed egg Custard, Truffle Sea bass and duck leg confit , pear crumble and hot choc lava. It was shiok. We love the food and definitely will come back for more.  
5
My wife had read reviews and didn't tell me! Apparently "the kitchen closes at 9.30 and the tarte tartin was a disappointment". Well we thought it was great. The food was fantastic. I had the shared rib eye which as perfect. And ordered the TT (while my wife quietly cringed). It duly arrived after the pre-ordained hour (we'd ordered it at the same time as ordering our mains - so not an issue). It was out of this world. While they didn't actually tell us the kitchen closed at 9.30, we were OK with it - we'd arrived at 7.30pm and were neither in a hurry nor looking to stay all night

Recommended by friends, brought my wife for our anniversary dinner. With the nice ambiance and highly attentive and professionally friendly service staff, we were in for a memorable night. The only letdown was probably the most important part i.e. the food itself; or perhaps our expectations were just too high. Though presentation of food was well done, the food itself came across as very average. Given the entire pleasant dining experience and price you pay, we certainly expected something better from the food
5
On my list of restaurants to try and was not disappointed. I would be back for the artichoke soup alone which was amazing. A small, well priced menu in an intimate restaurant setting. However, I would note that even though they have just renovated, they could do with some table cloths so that it doesn't look so "ikea canteen" style. Only negative comment! Service was fine and would be back again

We used to love this restaurant before the change of chef. Most items are more or less the same on the menu now but there seems to be a finesse lacking to the food. Dinner here in the past was something we always looked forward to but I have to say our first visit back since Sebastian Ng left, left us wanting. The guys had the 4 course dinner menu (good value for money seriously but nothing spectacular), my foie gras starter was pretty decent but our cold angel hair pasta with konbu, truffle oil & abalone was a bit of a letdown, which sort of got worse when our crowd favorite, the Chilean Seabass was completely underwhelming, overcooked and lacking in any delicate flavor whatsoever. Disappointed 3.5/5 overall - hope things will turn around sooner rather than later
3
A couple of dishes in the 4-courses dinner menu weren't available, which was a pity. Anyway, the appetizers were good, although the combination of foie gras and unagi was a little confusing. As for the mains, the lamb was deliciously tender. The Wagyu for 2 however, turned out a little flat although it was cooked to medium. Lastly, please double check the vintage of the wine you order. Slipped my mind and ended up with a younger vintage for the same price. Restaurant made up for it partly by serving a complimentary glass of Baileys. The wine cellar also is too cold for the Reds.

Ember was highly recommended, and I must say, the menu looked extremely interesting. We had a reservation for 6 people at 7.30....... As we were seated, we were informed that on the Entree menu, the PorkBelly was not available, and there was only 1 portion of lamb left.... Also, Tarte Tartin not available for dessert....... really? Top restaurant, running out of so many items on a menu by 7.30pm???Next, we ordered a bottle of red wine.... Be advised, wine here is VERY expensive....$120 for a McLaren Vale Shiraz..... This lovely wine arrived chilled...and by that, I mean icy cold....condensation on the bottle. Really??? Sparkling and White Wine are chilled....Red wine is NOT meant to be drunk COLD.....the flavours are totally ruined. The waiter presented the bottle, and opened it before we realised that the wine was cold...... On tasting, it was akin to vinegar....We asked if there was a bottle that had NOT been in the fridge....told no, but we could leave it to warm up....for $120 we were expected to accept a ruined bottle of red? We declined. We did then order a lovely white....chilled beautifully!!!!Starters arrived, and were all nice.Service of the Entrees was an absolute debacle. The last available lamb....(which I have to say, several of us wanted to order, but there was none left!....) , 1 Fish, 2 Angus, 2 Bouillabaise were ordered..... 5 guests received their meals together....the 6th guest, no. He had ordered one of the Bouillabaise. A quick simple dish. As good manners suggest, we all waited for his dish to arrive. Our meals became cold before the waiter advised that the other Bouillabaise would be around 15mins .....and produced a complimentary Burrata starter. What???? (If they missed an order, it would have been better to say so)So, 5 of us ate our cold meals. 1 then received and ate his nice piping hot Bouillabaise after we had all eaten ours.... Ridiculous!Desserts? 2 from the menu were now unavailable.... To be fair, the 4 ordered were unusual, and enjoyed.Recap....interesting menu. Poor service. Expensive, poorly stored wines. Small portion sizes for cost.This restaurant promised so much, but was extremely disappointing from start to finish.We would never recommend, or return with business colleagues as it was embarrassing

Me and my wife enjoyed a wonderful evening at Ember as part of a 10 day visit to Singapore. The restaurant was highly recommended to us by friends and rightly so. The food and ambience were perfect. And the service was attentive yet relaxed, friendly yet very professional. Ember should be high on your restaurant booking list if you're visiting Singapore.
5
The food was excellent. The set lunch was value for money. The steamed egg custard, mud-crab, asparagus & aonori was a great starter. Pan-seared Hokkaido scallops, orange & tarragon vinaigrette was a good combination. Pan-seared Angus Onglet was well done. For dessert, I highly recommend the Pistachio sponge, crumble and ice-cream crowned with a little ginger milk foam. If you are out to impress your clients or your loved one on a special occasion, Ember is the place to go. Reservation for lunch is necessary to avoid disappointment

This was an interesting menu with an interesting fusion of styles and tastes. Worked well for a once off but not all the time.

Compared with the usual Asian breakfast this mob has gone to the toast and jam European job. Their kitchen also neglected to order enough sausage. If I want Europe I will go to Europe !

Ember used to be our favorite restaurant for our family. First time back tonight since new chef /owners - not sure of the latter. Our waiter was ok - ill informed and had to check back on basic questions . The food was good but they informed us during our main course that we had to make our dessert selection as the kitchen closed at 9.30pm? Left us feeling hurried and wanting to leave ASAP and go elsewhere . Because of this, sadly will not go back . Ember used to have amazing friendly service and this is clearly lacking .What a pity!
5
Visited ember 5 years ago under chef Sebastian. Well that was history. The new ember in my opinion is even more creative and innovative. The foie gras with poached egg was well executed. Trout and grapefruit sauce complemented each other. Still one of my favourite restaurants
4
Has always enjoyed the food at Ember. Lunch is as usual, of great value. Perhaps, due to the peak hour.. Some service request were not followed up with.Partly because of manpower crunch. Usual range of menu which we all love. But after a pro-long time. Perhaps an injection of new dishes would trigger a sense of novelty. Will still be back. But the allurement is not that strong.
5
Quite simply, this is one of the best restaurant meals I have had anywhere in the world. Surprisingly, Ember was not in any of the "where to eat in Singapore" lists that my wife and I read (who writes those lists, anyway?) but we were taken their by a friend who is both a successful Sinaporean businessman and a real foodie! These are always the best recommendations. I started with a wonderful and delicate soft shell crab, one of the best I have ever had. But the highlight was the main course, a perfectly prepared miso marinated black cod. It was to die for, probably the best piece of fish I have ever tasted. (Strangely, the waitress tried to talk me into the seabass instead, saying that some of her diners found the cod too sweet. Luckily, I ignored her advice. However, my wife had the seabass and loved it also.) Although I don't always do dessert, I had to try it here after such fantastic first and second courses. Again, it was superb, a delightful chocolate lava cake. In summary, I know how personal eating is, but I would highly recommend this restaurant if you find yourself in Singpore
4
It had been a while, almost 6 years perhaps, since I last visited Ember. We were looking forward to celebrating a birthday with visiting family. The bread baskets were gone, replaced by hot savory rolls, one roll to two pax. The miso cod was off menu, that had been looked forward to. There was a mix up in the order, that led to some disappointment. Perhaps a dessert on the house would have helped the mood. The duck and pork were good but not spectacular. The desserts were fantastic. A good meal, but I am not sure I would return
5
we recently had fabulous dinner at this fine restaurant. we have eaten there annually for several years on visits to Singapore to visit family. It continues to exceed our expectations in terms of flavours, textures, and creative combinations as well as honest not haughty good service. Firstly save room for dessert! It is hard to pick a favourite, it makes the tasting menu a wise choice. In any event the pork belly is so sumptuous I could not resist. Do enjoy
5
I have been to this restaurant at least 10 times and have never had a bad meal. Its the kind of place you can bring friends, and several times I have brought my family with all 3 kids. Great value for money and you cant go wrong. The set lunch is one of the best, if not THE best deal in town. Staff now know me well and they are very good, remember names and what we like to eat. Things get a little crazy when they get busy, a little patience is needed but overall its a great experience
5
Had the price fixe 4 course meal. Selections available were well thought out. Portions were perfect in amount and extremely well presented. Service was excellent. Wine selection was limited. To have had a Chardonnay and Cab varietal selection would have complemented the meal that much better.The other two guests at the table were equally complementary of the meal and service
5
Triple Thumbs up for Ember service!! Got our orders wrong and we've got a free dinner on the house!! Awesomes service! We'l be back for sure!!!
4
Lovely food and great presentation. Really hate to be asked for your desert order because the kitchen is closing half way through the main course.
4
Really nice dessets :)Yummy.Away from the city crowd.
Nice Cosy place to chit chat and have a girls' night out.
Value for money and makes you wants to come back for more.

Despite its lowish rankings here, this place was packed for lunch while we were there, and i heard still everyday for lunch and dinner, so no worries there. Lunch is a standard $42 set with the occasional annoying $3 or $6 extras for their specials like sea bass and foie gras. You wonder if the extra is really for the ingredient or they just to capitalise on their favoritesMy crab cake starter is tiny, but tasty. For mains, i opted for what i thought was their cold angel hair but it was just a regular seafood linguine. My friends had the seabass and they seemed happy, though i notice the portions are half that of dinner's. the lava chocolate cake i had was good. During the meal, they did try to deliver our next course while our empty plates from the previous course were still on the tableAll in all, not terribly impressed with the lunch. May have to stick to the old menu favorites and for dinner to get a better experienc

My partner took me to Ember for dinner on my birthday after hearing good reviews from our friends. The black cod fish was highly recommended by friends so without hesitation I decided on that. My partner went with the three-course set menu. As he's not into desserts, he asked me what dessert I would like to have and he'll order that as part of his set. Upon hearing this, the waitress who was taking our orders stopped us and said I could not have his dessert and that if she catches me eating from his plates or taking his dessert, the items will be charged ala-carte. I demanded a reason for this, and she simply replied that its their restaurant policy.On hindsight, I wished I had left the restaurant instead of sitting through dinner and stomaching the anger of being treated in this manner. This was supposed to be a fine cuisine restaurant! Moreover, I certainly do not see any issue with my partner offering me his dessert, and the set dinner is definitely not cheap! Many a time I would catch the waitress looking in our direction which added to the displeasure. I will definitely not go back as the experience has left a bitter taste in my mouth. So much so that I don't even remember much about the dish I had.
4
One of my favourite restaurants in Singapore! The food is consistently good and the waitstaff are really friendly. There are quite a few good dishes however I would highly recommend the foie gras with egg yolk, and the cold angel hair pasta as both those dishes are tasty and very well put together.
3
Was there for lunch. Abit confused on the menu initially. Staff explained well anyway. Tried their foiegras as first course. I would say its abit mushy for my liking. Their duck confit was my main and it was yummy! Just a tinkle to the chef.. The duck confit can reduce their salt a little as I'm a person who loves my food salty but this is too much though. Dessert is heavenly good. Im usually not a dessert person but this chocolate lave cake is so great! Their service is very good. Well done and keep it up. :
4
You can never fail if you order the Foie gras with the mushroom and poached egg at Ember! Absolutely great every single time. I just tried the cold truffle angel hair pasta for the first time with Abalone, that was surprisingly good, though I wouldn't say it was better than the one at Satsuma Restaurant in Gallery hotel. The Chilean seabass is good too, just beware that it can get a little salty after a few bites. It is a little bit of a shame about the service. We had to ask for the bill three times before it finally came, but if you're out for a good meal with friends for a good price, then I would definitely check it out
4
Went there for lunch with a friend. They have a very good value Set Lunch Menu for arond $39++, $45++ with foie gras. Trust me, go for the foie gras, they are simply heavenly.I just recently reviewed about a very high end french restaurant, which I commented that it was over priced, although the food there was good. But I still believe food and price must be exceptional to achieve an 'Excellent'. One can only do that much with good. You can put the most expensive ingredients on the plate, and if it doesn't do anything for me, it doesm't do anything for me, no matter how expensive the ingredient is. I judge food with my palate, and while in a restauarnt, I judge food with both my palate and wallet. On that, I have to give Ember a 'Very Good' for it's excellent food, and great value for it Lunch Menu.My foie Gras was perfect, my crispy pork was perfect, and even thehot straight-from-the-oven bread served was perfect. Only dessert was ok. But hey, it still scored a "Very Good"!!!It definitely warrant a second visit, a third and fourth....

I had the pleasure of dining at Ember with a colleague. Whilst I had lived in Singapore for some years I had not come across this little treasure until recently. Tucked in at the base of he Hotel 1929, this Restuarant can be easily overlooked. This Restuarant offers a sense of intimacy which I have not experienced for many years. From the time you arrive you are welcomed like an honored guest. The menu is extensive however my choice of entree, main and desert was actually made by my waitress. She asked a few questions about what I liked and then made a some excellent suggestions. For entree it was foie gras, a beautiful tenderloin steak for main and a delicate little cake with figs for desert. There was also a great selection of wines to accompany any preference. This is a small Restuarant and so I would imagine you would need to book it advance. Highly recommended
5
Advanced reservation is a must but it is not crowded but cosy little restaurant but the food is absolutely beautiful. The service is brilliant, friendly but not overly disturbing. Pricing is reasonable. Look forward to going back again!
4
This is a very small place and as a consequence it can get pretty noisy in here especially when there are larger groups in - the tables are pretty close together so whilst not a great place for ambience - the food is excellent. The staff are great and service is first rate.I am not a fan of their method of cooking the rack of lamb - whilst it should be pink the one I had was undercooked for my taste but still edible . The steak is really good thoughDon't turn up and expect to get a table - best to book first. Overall a pleasant place and worth a visit
5
My wife and I stumbled across this resturaunt on a short city break to Singapore last month. The staff were very friendly, with just the right amount of attentiveness (when you needed them but not too much more). Menu was fresh - would happily go back and eat through lots of the other things on offer but settled for ordering different plates each, on each course and sharing (though the sharing turned out to be more of "here, have a forkfull" as the food really was special. The food was well priced, and the wine list had a good range and was not too expensive (which can be the case is some places). The full five stars, and if it wasn't on the other side of the world, would be going back on a regular basis. Wonderful

Had a birthday dinner with our friends. Once again, it was a great dinner from appetizers to desserts... the pan fried foie gras with 1-hour poached egg, the pan-fried fish, duck confit, steak, lobster, sashimi, angel hair with ebi, pear tart, choc fountain and etc.... all are really really nice. Also, the service was great and we liked everyone who served us that night. Thank you and I will definitely go back
4
Absolutely love the Foie Gra here... its a staple and must order for us whenever we come here...This is probably our zillionth time here at Ember, and the Foie Gra never ceases to to amaze our palettes... Pan Fried Foie Gra with Porcini Sauce and 1hr poach egg. apparently you can order a double portion too, i will the next time i'm there!We had the degustation menu (Tasting menu) this time round @ $125++, 8 courses and we noticed the Foie Gra was not included, so we asked if it could be one of the dishes and surely, our wish was granted.Have to compliment the chef on the flavors used for each dish and we were pleasantly surprised. Our next favorite was definitely the cold Angel Hair Pasta with Abalone and Truffle Sauce... the hot Angel hair with small deep fried shrimps (abit spicy) was also a favorite...definitely will return... hope the chef changes the menu frequently...Overall 4.5/

My friend managed to snag a difficult-to-get reservation here after trying a couple of times. The group of us have been here several times in the past 10 years and the food have remained somewhat good and consistent. First of all, the freshly made bread is good and some of my friends feel, 1 of the best in the country. We opted for the set consisting of 4 dishes. They had an italian chianti which i liked. We all chose the scallop sashimi, which I think is average compared to the best Japanese joints in town or elsewhere. The next dish of crab pasta is excellent though, al dente and slightly spicy . My friends who had the foie gras with poached egg loved it, I might try that next time. Our mains arrived and my steak though cooked well, became average when one thinks of the best steak houses around the world. My friend liked his duck confit. 2 friends had their special seabass and 1 loved it as usual and the other found it way too salty, even 1.5 hours after the meal! We had their special apple tart which again I found average, should have had their valrhona lava cake instead. All in all, no regrets, but a couple of hitches here and there I think, and they should figure out more unique recipes to stay competitiv

Charming unpretentious restaurant.Love a restaurant with a small menu as I believe you just need to do your signature dishes well.Apart from being one of the first, if not the first, high end restaurant to open along the now ultra-hip Keong Siak street, it is also one of the most long lasting restaurant helmed by our very own Singaporean chef.We liked everything we ordered. While i love the Hokkaido scallops carpaccio and the condiments that accompanied it, sometimes I think good seafood should just be so ever lightly seasoned to showcase its natural sweetness. For this dish, the condiments oveepowers the scallops. Discounting that, the salad would have been a stellar on its own merit.Foie gras with poached egg and the Chilean seabass has been more than adequately reviewed.One of my favorite all time dish there is actually the seafood linguine. It is on the menu as a main course, but you can order it in appetizer portion too. Love love love it. The linguine is perfectly al dente, the seafood broth so amazing sweet. The pasta is also lightly spiced with chilli padi to give it the extra kick. Yumzzzzzz.Chocolate fondant dessert is my choice of vice. And it comes with vanilla bean ice cream. Classic and timeless.While food is European with an Asian influence, I would not call it a fusion restaurant. I love how he creates classic european dishes, and yet maintain an unassuming service. Eating here feels like you are eating at an old friend's place. You never feel pressured, never feel hurried and yet feels totally well-fed and taken care of

My boyfriend and me had a bad experience in this restaurant on boxing day. Upon arrival at the restaurant, we were served by this unfriendly waitress who brought us two menu, brush thru the set menu by saying that there is no steak, lamb etc. The restaurant was noisy hence we could not hear her clearly. We told her we could hardly hear heras it is noisy but did mentioned something to her about no steak and lamb serve, she immediately rebulk us so sarcatically and said "You heard me, right". We did not hear her clear and was uncertain and by asking her again, we received such unfriendly and sarcastic remarks from her which is totally unacceptable coming from a waitress. When i went on asking her if it is only this day that the set menu does not include steak and lamb or has it run out for the day, she simply ignore us. Given the noise in the restaurnat, we could undertand she didnt hear us clear but yet she were so unhappy when she has to repeat what she said to us. Even though she may be very busy she need not have to react this way. We were not expecting first class service but since this restauant is situated in Hotel 1929, i believe there should be some kind of service train waitress. This is totally unacceptable and i hope the restaurant management will take serious action to train this waitress (not that she is young as she doesnt look young probably in her thirties to forties), she lacks patience which is the utmost importance of a service staff otherwise, i think this job is definitely not suitable for her. I must say that when a customer walks into the restaurant, aside from the good food, it is the service that count too. Without basic service, customer will also not return for the 2nd time. Sadly, i have lost my first impression about the restaurant will not return ever no matter how good the food may be. It is the image that stays

I've eaten at Ember a couple of times at Ember over the years. Chef Sebastian Ng delivers a menu of consistently impressive French-Asian food and the $39 set lunch (with a wide selection of choices) is great value for money. I'd also highly recommend the dinner tasting menu which, at $98, is one of the affordable places in Singapore for food of this quality. The dining room itself is nothing to shout about but service is friendly and efficient, presentation is wonderful and there are hordes of regulars. It's hard to leave without feeling impressed
5
The set lunch is awesome value for money with many great choices and all done to perfection. For dessert, I always go for the lava cake which I believed is one of the best in Singapore (and better than what I have tasted at some Michelin star restaurants in New York City)
5
Beautiful meal in wonderful surroundings - The desert was amazing nougat with Lycee sorbet.
5
After a break of almost two years, we revisited Ember in Singapore. The staff are still top-notch service-wise and the food as always was delicious and well-presented. This is one place you can rely on to deliver and the glowing reviews from others are correct. Its also excellent value- in Singapore you can pay a lot of money to eat at the latest place, so do yourself a favour and dine at Ember instead
4
Party of 8 went for an early holiday lunch. It's a small restaurant, maybe 15 tables. Most of us Pre-ordered our food and that ensured maximum smoothness. For $45 we got 3 courses, I had a foie gras appetizer, beef tenderloin main (with sides of fries and salad) and tart tartin for dessert. All were very well prepared, portions right for the ladies and service impeccable, water filled without having to ask. The tart tartin was to die for, the crust all caramelised yet crusty, served of course with ice cream. For other mains the cod and sea bass were also well received, and the cheese plate (in lieu of a sweet dessert) looked yummy! I would go back
5
I have been eating at Ember since 2004. Ember doesn't just serve excellent food, it serves excellent food consistently. And to me, that is the hallmark of a good restaurant. Everytime I walk into the restaurant, I know that it doesn't disappoint, and I walk out satiated and happy. I also like the understated but warm and friendly service staff. They don't fuss or hover over you, but give you just enough attention to make you feel like a valued customer
4
The lunch set has a comprehensive choice of selection. The dishes were nicely presented and had a pleasurable taste. Warm foccacia bread was toasty and tasted well and fresh. The salad was refreshing and zesty.Miso cod fish reflected a Japanese taste.Warm lava cake was a perfect way to completed the meal. Lunch set ordered was of good value. Service was earnest and sincere. Would love to be back again!
4
a nice little restaurant tucked away in the Chinatown district, it was overall a pleasant experience. weekday lunch here is quite busy, we had he set lunch. food was creative, fusion of cuisines, some dishes executed better than others. service was scattered and felt very rushed and rehearsed. wine selection was very limited, expected better for a restaurant serving this quality of food. Good value though
5
Ember seldom disappoints. Having garnered many regulars over the years, a reservation is needed if you want to secure a table as the restaurant is not big. Serving up fusion food inclined slightly towards fine dining, some of the dishes there play with your palate and might tingle your tongue a fair bit. There's tasty food and there's exciting food. Ember brings the 2 together. Definitely a must visit for those in search of new tastes and after a good satisfying meal
5
1st time there and it did not look like any fancy restaurant at all, in fact, it was very a very small and cosy place. What it lacked in the classy department was made up by the superb quality of the food and service. Was served by Lilian who was so attentive and good with her recommendations.First and foremost, the bread roll that they served was to die for. Can't get enough of it. We ordered over and over again. It came out hot from the oven and went so well with the cold butter served.For appetizers, we had foie gras with half-boiled egg and Parma ham, pan-fried scallops, fried oystes with 8 dips. The foie gras was simply heavenly. For someone who doesn't like half boiled eggs, I was slurping up the last drop of the egg with the foie gras as the flavours were so, so, so good together. The scallops and oysters were average as I've tried more succulent and flavorful ones elsewhere before.For starters, we shared the crispy pork belly, 2 cod fish and a steak. The pork belly was excellently done as its simply melt-in-the-mouth goodness. As for the cod, the part that I had seemed to have a few lumps and thus not as perfect as I hoped it to be. The steak was above average and had a very smooth texture that doesn't resemble meat to me, still prefer my steak from Morton's.For dessert, we just had 1 dish of nougat with lychee sorbet as we were pretty full by then. The nougat was crisp and the lychee tasted very good, like eating a real lychee. All the taste fully complemented each other.Overall, this place is a must go for every true blue foodie
5
It has been many years since I have been here and it was great to find that my favourites were still on the menu and tasted just as I remembered. Well seasoned food, very well resented, portions slightly on the small side but if you have 3 courses and pace yourself, you felt nicely full but not over stuffed.The staff will customise dishes for you and if you fancy having one of the main course pastas for a starter, that's fine with them. My seafood linguine was good, the lamb rack was outstanding and apple tart brought the dinner to a very satisfying finish.My dining companions had steak, fish, apple pie and frozen nougat and they also proclaimed their satisfaction with how the meal turned out.A very good all round experience. Should come back again before I leave
5
My wife and I spend had been spending our anniversaries each year there since getting together. For a fine dining place, it is not too pricey and the food is lovely. My wife always remembers the seabass fillet which was the best ever eaten. I would say all the food is pretty good and wouldnt stick to the same choice each time we're back there. Would recommend if you intend to bring your partner for a great dinner! Best to reserve in advance though and try to get the window seats, think its much better
3
Tasty food but scope of selection is very limited. Execellent service by the lady manager
4
Basic breakfast - service made everything alright.
4
Don't miss the Chilean Sea Bass with truffle and the Oysters, magnificent!
5
You must try the foie gras with poached egg as well as the cold abalone pasta.
Have been going there for years, and never been disappointed.
5
Went for a date night with the wife, very stressed in preparation of our daughter's birthday party. Couldn't really afford any time at all but the kids were with grandma,so off we went. We had been to Ember before and chose it as we liked what we got last time.So this time, we spent S$ 200 for two 4- course menues. We started with sahimi vs. spicy pasta, followed by foie gras vs. tofu, followed by lamb vs. beef, ending with French toast vs. apple pie. And every single dish met and surpassed expectations and hopes!Service is speedy, friendly, knowledgeable and personal but rather informal- very nice.Yes, we will be back for more..
5
I have been a loyal customer of this restaurant for years, and everytime I go there for lunch or dinner, I could pick any thing from the menu and was never disappointed with my choice - all the way from appetizer to dessert, thanks to the owners who also run the restaurant and make sure the food is top quality!
5
I had not expected to have my best ' Confit de Canard' in Singapore but it was to die for. And with some prodding , the recipe came through! We ate on a midweek evening so the restaurant was not crowded. The service was personal, interested and attentive. The wine was excellent - did not expect less. A memorable evening
4
Had the 3-course Set Lunch at Ember. I am impressed by the vast options available to guests to mix-and-match their set lunch. Ember provided guests with as many as 8 options for their normal appetiser, main dish & desserts. They had the option to top-up $6++ to upgrade the appetiser to foie gras.Their relatively generious variety of food will have guests returning often for various combination and not feel bored!Best to make a reservation before going as the seating area is quite small. Not really ideal for business lunch due to the relatively confined space, can get quite noisy. Details & photos:http://yummydelight.wordpress.com/2011/10/10/restaurant-ember

Living in Singapore, I regularly dine at this restaurant, be it for a nice lunch on a work day or a special family celebration.The food has always been consistently good and reasonably priced; the service is friendly and the ambience is pleasant, located in a hip boutique hotel on the fringe of Singapore's Chinatown.No weird over-priced new-fangled creations here...the miso cod and apple tart are my favorites, among many..
5
My gf and I travelled from Europe to Singapore, then Bali (Ubud and Seminyak) and finally Gili Islands. Probably, Ember restaurant was the best restaurant we went to in this trip alongside with Ku-de-ta, in Bali. Very romantic and cosy atmosphere.From the starters, main course to the desserts, everything was DELICIOUS!!! Five-star cuisine, chique, elegant, very good presentation, well done, great staff
4
Very satisfied with our first visit to Ember. A very pleasant evening. Good food, service of a high standard, and a nice ambience. Will certainly be back.
1
Very ordinary despite good reviews from many...
4
Great set lunch. But tight space and noisy
3
Ember came higly recommended so we thought we'd give it a try. The food was quite good,, but a bit pricey I had the oyster starter and the steak and my friend had the salad with truffles and pork. The food was delicious but the service was not very good and this spoilt what could have been a good experience. The ambiance is very nice and modern below hotel 1929.

Amazing dinner, highly recommend the 4 course menu for $100. I am picky about my steak, like it med well, so I forgive them for not wanting to cook it more, I get that chefs hate that. I sent it back, but it came back the same 4 minutes later. Every other course was perfect, and the presentation was like works of art. See my pictures. The crab pasta starter was insanely good. My friends lobster starter was insanely good. My tofu salad and her scallop salad were fabulous, their sesame dressing is so good. Dessert was crazy good. We had the pear tart and the chocolate cake. Homemade ice cream was the best I've ever had. And NO I don't work for them haha. Cute place inside hotel1929 in Chinatown

If you are in Singapore and would like to have a nice romantic night out, Ember is the place. It is a quaint little place, part of a small boutique hotel in Chinatown. We went in and delighted ourselves to a wonderful little menu and lovely food. We have to commend Sabrina who served us. She was very attentive and even when our wine of choice ran out, she did offer us other types of wine which is lovely since many today lack the ability to show good customer service. The food is a fusion of japanese and french and it was delightful especially the soup that came with a very unusual way of serving and the fact that it was served with roasted duck. The baramundi was lovely and the desert, apple jello and celery sorbett was a nice touch to end our evening. As we left, Sabrina even walked us out to show us to our next stop and that just made the whole dining experience memorable. Good food and excelent service

Let's skip to the chase.....if mouth-watering modern western food is your bag then get down to Ember, situated at funky Hotel 1929.It had been over 2 years since we last visited but once the complimentary fresh-baked bread arrived we remembered why it had been one of our favourites.Field mushroom w truffle oil soup for me and fried tofu with fois grois sauce for the wife. The soup was without doubt the best I have ever had....."soup-tastic" !!!The wife was left speechless by her tofu - "double bonus" !!!For main course I had Chilean seabass with bacon & mushroom ragu and a truffle & butter sauce....one word....WOW !!! Beautifully cooked, fresh, and loaded with taste I could not get enough. I also had a side of herb-crusted potatoes which were great and asked for extra sauce that was delivered with a smile. The wife had one of the daily specials - barramundi - and it too was first class.For desert we shared a yummy warm chocolate cake with vanilla bean ice-cream. In addition the service was warm, friendly and not at all pretentious - and we left agreeing that it was the best meal we had had in years.It's not cheap - budget $100 for a couple - but trust me it's worth every penny.Go on treat yourself

I was taken to Ember at the end of 2007 and I thought it was the loveliest place. I am surprised it wasn't reviewed more highly but I've not been in two years so things may have changed. The service was great, very attentive and discreet. I went with a friend on a Monday night and we didn't have a reservation but we easily got a table, though we were told we needed to vacate it within an hour. However, we ended up staying for more than 90 mins and we were never rushed or hurried by the staff. I had the shiitake mushroom foie gras and the steak, while my friend had soup and fish and we shared the dessert. That came to about $40+ each (no alcohol). I do agree, however, that the servings, for the mains at least, were a little on the small side. The ambience was very calm, quiet and not at all crowded like the other reviews mentioned, but again, this may have to do with it being a Monday. It was mostly expats and well-to-do locals and although the restaurant is small, it definitely was not cramped at all. I love how it was situated in the middle of old Chinatown and part of the boutique hotel - Hotel 1929 if I remember correctly. There was no bar but you could order wine and beers, you can always head down to the New Majestic (same owners) if you want drinks and they have a funky Enid Blyton themed bar there

A wonderfully tasteful, small, but not cramped, designer space, in the heart of Singaporeâ€™s Chinatown. Menu looks perhaps a tad more interesting than the food actually is, but the food is good nonetheless, definitely satisfying. Flavours tend toward the nouveau, a departure from traditional, and portions are on the scant side, sometimes sacrificing content in favour of form. Service is amiable, warm and efficient, although sometimes a bit over-attentive. Are they trying to provide better service or turn the table quicker? Hard to tell. Overall, a great experience, worth the effort to reserve and get there, but not a leisurely or lingering dining experience

We are staying in the hotel that is part of the same building although I *think* the ownership is different.After flying in from Hong Kong we were knackered and didn't want to go wandering around finding somewhere and the place was almost full which we took as a good sign.Ember has a really chilled atmosphere and had a happy crowd mixed of all ages and seemed to have an equal measure of locals to visitors. I was feeling quite sick before the meal perhaps due to change in pressure, jet lag from recent travel and so opted for the simple with a mushroom soup starter and steak for my main and both were stunningly good. My girlfriend was also very happy with her mushroom lasagne (I think) main and the staff were just so friendly and nice it made us feel much better than we had done before we headed in.We didn't order any drinks but we had two lovely deserts and all in all we both agreed that all round this was one of the nicest meals we have had in a long time and we dine out fairly often.I cannot give this restaurant a more glowing review and they really deserve it

My friend and I took leave to have the set lunch and it was worth it.
The set lunch is about $38 (top up $6 for foie gras dish).
We enjoyed the food very much. Will definitely go back again.
