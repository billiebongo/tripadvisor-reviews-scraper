Big portion, tender deep fried pork loin with that sliver of fat which melts in your mouth. Dip it in the katsu sauce, shovel the hot sticky Jap rice in your mouth...it's heaven. Plain water is now free...so chill, people!

I was here on Dec 24 and ordered rice curry with pork. The portion is very big but for me the taste is just normal. The service is good though.
4
This restaurant specializes in Japanese tonkatsu. It's one of the more famous tonkatsu restaurant here in Singapore.
Quality pork used to make the tonkatsu and they have different cuts for clients to choose. Spent about $30 per person.
4
This place never fails to serve the best pork üê∑ katsu in town! They are fried to perfection and served with free flow of salad. Another favorite of mine is their fried, but succulent oyster!

This is the Family Restaurant, last week we been there, we had the set lunch for two.
The location at Isetan Shaw House shopping mall. Reasonable prices. The restaurant seat not much mostly walk in guest from Isetan.

Tonkichi (Takashimaya) located at 391 Orchard Road Ngee Ann City, #04-24 Ngee Ann CityWe decided to go there for lunch. It has been a while since our last visit to Tonkichi, so I was quite excited to try it again. After having the Tonkatsu at Tonkichi, I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m thrilled to say that it is still as good as before, and I will go so far as to say that they have one of the best Tonkatsu in Singapore. It has a menu that focuses on sinful but oh-so-good deep-fried food. We decided to skip the Kurobuta Pork and go for Hire Katsu, Yakubari comprises Deep-fried pork fillet, prawn, oysters, and crab croquette, and Cheese Kasane Katsu. Everything was delicious. Deep-fried to a gorgeous golden brown, the Hire katsu was crispy, and not too oily, and the melty cheese oozing out of the pork loin was scrumptious. Big plus for to the Staff are very professional the service is excellent and very friendly and attentive. Overall, So Satisfied, We Couldn't Ask For More

We ordered the hire set, chicken katsu set, chicken katsu curry set and a kid's meal. Everything was fine and delicious till my son's meal arrived. His chicken karaage which was part of his kid's set was uncooked. When we alerted them, and the chicken was recooked, they did not bother to redo a new one, just refrying what I sent back. Water costs $1 too and no one bothers to refill this. Disappointing!

This is another restaurant that shows its disdain for customers by charging ($1!) for water. The water in Singapore is perfectly drinkable from the tap so there is no excuse for this beyond pure profiteering. A 10% service charge is levied, which comes to over $2 a head on average. The food is only so-so. Absolutely NOT RECOMMENDED. The way to stop profiteering in this way is to stop patronising such establishments. We used to come to Tonkichi but no longer will we do so. Management may wish to note that this short-sighted policy has lost them four customers, who spend on average over $100 per visit

The Rosu Katsu(deep fried pork loin) Set comes with unlimited free flow of cabbage and rice. The freshly-fried Tonkatsu had a nice crunch and yet still moist and tender. Roasted sesame seeds were provided in a small bowl with a wooden grinder so that you can choose to have it coarse or fine. I was told that we were suppose to mix the sesame seeds with the Tonakatsu sauce and use the paste on the Tonkatsu. I love the sesame seeds but the Tonakatsu sauce disagrees with me as it seems to have a lot of MSG. If you're MSG intolerant, stay away from the sauce. Overall, thought $23 for a simple set is quite dear. However, they do have Groupon specials and it's definitely worth a try
5
The food is really authentic with free cabbage top ups and green tea. I had the OCBC promotion set - Katsu Hire with prawns. This is one of the rare times when I the pork is really lean and the prawns are really big and fresh. Unlike other "fake" Japanese restaurants where food are cooked by the Chinese nationals, you find the prawns extremely small when you break the batter.And also, the pork extremely hard. So, highly recommended that you visit Tonkichi at Ngee Ann City

Don't expect a full glass of beer....they allow a 1 1/2 inch of foam ...
They say it's their standard !!
Be careful
We are not ordering beer here forever !!

Had dinner with friends in this restaurant. I had the Mentaiko Kasane Katsu Set.The presentation of the set is done nicely. The main feature of this set is the slice pork loin that sandwiched the mentaiko (spicy silver cod roe). Set includes a bowl of rice, lots of shredded cabbage, seasoned turnip and a bowl of miso with mustard on the side. Two slices of orange is presented as part of the set as a dessert.The pork loin is crispy and cabbage is easy to eat as it is finely shredded. The whole set is big enough for a good meal.Staffs are reasonably friendly and attentive. Place is clean. Quiet enough for conversations with others even though the proximity between tables are close. Bear in mind I can hear the conversation from another table beside us for the night

Passed by this restaurant when we were at Takashimaya. Decided to give it a try since we have tried Ma maison. This is nice than Ma maison in our opinion.The tonkatsu is nice with refillable cabbage. We refilled about 3 times. Staffs are friendly. We will go again when we have the craving :
5
It was one of those days when I really wanted to have a good Pork Tonkatsu and I remembered a friend recommending this restaurant. The food was great & exactly what I had wanted. The quality of the pork & ingredients were amazing and I have to make special mention of the quality of the Japanese rice which was great. Will certainly go back. Service can be improved a little more. 5 stars are purely for the foo

I ordered a sashimi and tonkatsu set for a friday dinner. The sashimi slices were very fresh and thick while the tonkatsu was hot, crispy and fried to perfection. The food came in with just a little waiting time with excellent service. Definitely a place that is value for money
4
We went to this place for lunch yesterday. We ordered ;# Rosu Katsu which was quite good in terms of crispness outside and juicy meat inside. The taste and quality was also quite good. # Eel Rice set which came with- Cawanmushi which steam egg full of seafood meat inside. But the taste on this one was quite insipid. - Eel very juicy and tasty - Steam rice really good quality, sticky and very shiny. - Japanese green peas was ok. - Miso soup was quite nice. - Fermented tofu and pickles was ok. At the end they served us 2 slides of orange with seeds and hard to eat. The service was not attentive.

My husband and I have patronized Tonkichi since 20 years ago together our then baby girl at Takashimaya branch. Over the years, we have brought our children to all 5 tonkichi branches. The food standard and staff service have remained consistent and of high standard. Our favorite dishes include sashimi, hire & rosu katsu, tonkichi set, agadeshi tofu. The pork fried to its perfection, succulent and juicy. Sashimi is fresh and smooth to the palette. Some of the staff are still with the company. These familiar faces of the restaurant staff give my family's a very comfortable and homely dinning experience. Will continue to eat at Tonkichi especially Tampines branch, as it is located near our home. Excellent service and great food. Always filled our stomach and feeling satisfied after a meal there

My family decided to 'splurge' for a good dinner at Takashimaya and came across this Japanese joint. We ordered the Prawn & Rosu Katsu set ($25.90), Hire Katsu Toji set($24) and Jap Curry (loin) set ($24). Total plus GST was about $90. So $30 per person is pretty decent for a good meal. All three sets were amazing, you can actually taste the quality in the meat and batter- deep fried to perfection! The Rosu and Hire meats were really aromatic while the loin was extremely tender but not as aromatic. I would definitely choose the Rosu/ Hire over the loin anytime. The rice was aromatic and cooked well - not too dry or not too wet. The cabbage was free flow - you can add on anytime you want. I would definitely come back again.
4
My family and I have been going to this restaurant for a few years already. It is one of our favourite restaurants and it is our choice of food whenever we are in the Orchard area. I always get the hire katsu set, while my parents get the curry set and the don set, all of which we enjoy. I recommend adding on the soup (not miso) in the menu as the broth is very rich. I don't normally take tonkatsu as they tend to get very hard to eat as the meat gets extremely tough if not done well. However, the ones here are really good and I am always craving for more. Even though it might be slightly pricey, the quality of food and friendly staff make the cost of the food worth it, as it is a guaranteed satisfying meal

had a great casual japanese dinner with my family, it was easy to get everyone into the mood and enjoyed our dinner thoroughly. service was immaculate! staffs were courteous, warm and genuine. do not be shy to ask for an extra helping of shredded cabbage, the staffs will be glad to refill you heaps and heaps of it. good standard tonkatsu, its quality you pay for. every grain of rice is so plump and well polished. loved their houji-cha (roasted green tea) and would most definitely return again! the restaurant @isetan has a nice window bay view, enjoy your meal! Itadakimasu!

Love their food. Nicely located at Ngee Ann City.
Quality food and nice ambience.
Good for family dining.
3
This place is considered one of the better ones in Singapore. However it is no where comparable to those I have tasted in Japan.
Service is good.
4
Good food and service, but mostly fried items are nice. Good mortar and pestle to grind the sesame seeds to make your own dip.
3
The ambience was kind of cosy and sweet, food was average. Portion is huge and filling, free flow of veg salad. However, the only thing that disappointing was the service staff. No eye contact or smile (base in the service I'm paying for it), when we were trying to surprise our dear Friend, server just place the box of cake on the table. Instead of placing it on a plate or etc. It became nothing special and the service staffs is totally, nothing special to remember at all.

I have always visited Tonkichi (Ngee Ann City, Orcghard Central) ordering the Ebi Fry and Hire Katsu whenever I go with my Family, Friends and collegues.Last week when I tried the Kurobuta (black pork), then I knew I have found a new love. The Black Pork Katsu are Tender, Juicy (feel like eating prawn except that you are eating Pork Katsu). The Taste and the Bite is unbelievable. You will need to try it out your self to believed its that Tender.Other side Dishes to recommend is the Kawa ebi that goes very well with ice cold BeerOne Thing to hi-light is that the service standard have drop tremendously and have changed their Tata sauce to the Salard type, This I think is a major set back to the high quality dining experience that I used to enjoy. Hopefully they can revert and improved on this.Other than this, I think its still a better Tonkatsu restaurant compared to Ma maison, Saboten, Ootoya and Watami in terms of its Taste, quantity
3
The food was fine but there were other restaurant choices that have the recipe and "crisp" down a lot better. It used to be nice but it was just so-so for me. I was surprised but appreciate the manager switching or editing my order that is not on the menu for a katsu and friend oysters split instead of just katsu.Can't complain though staff that evening (late dinner) wasn't able to notice my tea for refill till I had to point it out...most likely a slow weekday feel

Generally I would avoid restaurants in shopping centres like the plague as I have had some dreadful culinary experiences in them, but in Singapore that rule doesn't really apply. Here the restaurants benefit from the fact that most people in Singapore spend a HUGE amount of time enjoying the air conditioning in the shopping centres......and so the range of cuisines in the centres along Orchard Road is quite staggering.I was introduced to Tonkichi by a friend when we still lived in Singapore and I went back many times, so on this trip I was pleased that it was still there and as good as ever.The decor is typical of an tonkatsu restaurant in Japan. Nothing swanky, as you can see from the photos here, but why distract from the food ?PictureThe Sapporo was served chilled to about 2 degrees above frozen...... but after a long day in the heat of Singapore the speed by which it was served and the temperature were both welcomed.Both my husband and I had Katsu Don, which is one of my favourite Japanese dishes. It was delicious. It was as good as and Katsu dish I have had in Japan. I would of liked the sauce to be a bit thicker and a bit more flavour, but that is just because I am VERY picky !!I guess Japanese food isn't on most tourists list of things to eat during a tip to Sinagpore, but if you are over Laksa, chili crab and Rendang and find yourself in Takashimaya seeking refuge from the heat, then I would definitely suggest a lunch break in Tonkichi. If you live in Singapore or visit regularly, then there are no excuses. Give this place a try. They also have great set lunch bento boxes√¢‚Ç¨¬¶www.anexpatwife.co

This is my 2nd time to this restaurant in Orchard Takashimaya Brunch. Had lunch on a Wednesday 15-July with my partner, we order a Rosu Katsu set meal (pork) with an additional bowl of soup (S$6), ala carte 1pc fish (S$5) and 1pc oyster (S$6). The fried pork is nice so is the oyster (have to eat it while is hot). Overall the taste is good (best fried pork I have eaten), the meat is not dry and is not oily. As a "lionstar member" (can registered on line) and my birthday month, we get a 20% discount. So is much worth it
5
Bought special deal voucher, value for money. Used the voucher to have dinner with my son. We like the tenderize fried pork chop. Juicy, meaty & crispy. Yummy. The set comes with a bowl of soup, side dish of pickles, oranges as after dinner fruits. We like that the cabbage & rice are free flow, after 2nd plate of cabbage. So satisfy. We also order chawamushi, very smooth. Their miso tofu soup was good, with radish, pork slices.
4
This restaurant is located on the 3rd floor of Shaw House. They serve Tonkatsu and other deep-fried items. The tonkatsu include different cuts of meat, such as the pork loin and tenderloin. There's also fried oyster which I love and always order.They have sets available, so its easy to order. Rice and sliced cabbage is free-flow. Try it
4
a big thumbs up! been to tonkichi up at takashimaya... very good. love the bento set and all the katsu dishes :) very nice watermelon smoothie too
4
Great family meal at Tonkichi at Ngee Ann City. Service was ok, ambience was good. In any case, we loved the pork with the large helpings shredded cabbage.
3
I used to think that Tonkichi is one of the best tonkatsu restaurant in Singapore. But now it taste no longer good. I ordered kurobuta and its not as nice as before, the cut is thinner, the sauce is not nice.
4
While I believe this place is known for fried food, we all had sashimi, rolls and noodle dishes which were all very good. The salmon roll was quiet large and the sushi very tender. Worth stopping by if you are in the mall.
4
First ate at Tonkichi few years ago at Changi Airport, and felt they were quite an authentic Tonkatsu place in Singapore similar like those in Japan where you grind your own sesame seeds with a bowl and wooden stick. They also provided instructions what sauce to use and the cabbage were free flow.Went to Tonkichi at Ngee Ann City this Tuesday as there was a $25++ promotion on J Passport (https://www.passp.asia/signin/index) for Iberico Pork Tonkatsu set. There was no instructions how to eat, no waitress moving around with big bowls of cabbage to refill but generally the food and service is goo
1
Went in at 2 30 pm on Thursday, placed my order and waited. 15 mins later, still no sign of my food OR tea. Called the manager, he said he'll check. Then comes the server asking about what I ordered. Apparently, she took my order then went to do something and totally forgot about my order! There was 1 other table besides me and they were already done with their meal. SERIOUSLY! I was sitting there for 15 mins in an almost empty restaurant. And NOBODY has the sense to check whether my order went through or if I even placed an order!! There were 3 servers, a manager just standing around. Complete waste of my time. Just stomped out of the place. Never going there again. If the service is like this at an off peak hour, imagine what it's like at peak times
5
Our last visit to Tonkichi was a few years ago - happily the quality of their Katsu is as awesome as we remembered ! We ordered both Japanese and USA version of the Kurobuta Rosu Katsu. Both equally fantastic! The thickness of the pork cutlet was just right and texture was tender n juicy. Service was great - free flow of Japanese tea and fresh finely shredded cabbage. Compared to Tampopo @rRver valley - Tonkichi wins hands down!! The Katsu prok cutlet at Tampopo was thinner and much smaller in size. Cutlet was also slightly dry. Can't wait to go back again soon to Tonkichi
4
We found this restaurant whilst looking for somewhere on Orchard Rd, which wouldn't involve re-mortgaging. The meal was quick and extremely tasty (we both had chicken Katsu Curry!). The restaurant is also in a great area, to go shopping or the cinema afterwards. Try and get a booth by the window for a great view of Orchard Roa
5
This place specialises in the tonkatsu - breaded and deep fried pork chops. The Rosu Katsu is the fattier, juicier one, but I like to go for the Rosu Katsu Toji, where the pork cutlet comes in a claypot filled with sauce, and egg, and is just delicious. Free refills of rice and miso soup, and make sure you ask for the free cabbage because the salad dressing is worth it
4
Best Katsu ever!!! Been there so many times and never got sick of it. Food is so good. Katsu is the best ive ever triedand the rice is very fragrant. Recommend the one in Orchard Central ! Price is reasonable for the quality you're getting. Only disappointing part was the Kushiyaki wasnt that good
3
Nothing bad about the place - just another pricey Orchard Road establishment with serviceable Japanese food. Nothing to write home about. Food is okay, service is not bad. Ask for a table near the window, if you are going there anyway.
4
Visited the orchard central branch a couple of times.
Love the tonkatsu. Yummy pork. Go for the the combo type so that you can enjoy difference cuts of the pork.
Good service by staffs too.
4
We went for the Tonkatsu and were not disappointed. Very tender pork and fresh cabbage unlimited .
Tonkatsu sauce is also recommended and essential.
4
You have the best guys serving you at their OC branch.
Food is good. A bit on the pricey side for tonkatsus.
4
Tonkichi - Isetan Scotts350 Orchard Rd, L4 Shaw House We like the Kuro Kata Rosu (Black Pork) better than the Hire Set. The pork was delicious and tender. We also ordered the Chawanmushi, the Vegetable Tempura and the Tori Mix set. The Chawanmushi was so so. But the portions were generous and value for money. The service was a little slow
5
My girl friend brought me here many years ago and since then I am hooked! This is my favorite restaurant for tonkatsu whenever I visit Singapore. Food is consistently good!!! This time round I ordered the mixed seafood katsu set combo instead of my normal pork combo. My verdict? Selection of seafood were really fresh especially the oysters. Katsus were lightly battered, non greasy and so crunchy. Service's good and prompt. Perfection
4
I went to the Takashimaya branch for dinner. I ordered Hire and Rosu Set (pork) with an oyster katsu (not sure if I make the term right) and a mug of beer.The pork was very good. It was very crispy and tasty. The food take about 10-15mis to come and piping hot. The set came with heap of cabbage, two tiny tomatoes, pickle radish, rice and miso soup. Salad dressing was provided on the table. So I can put it the way I like. About oyster, it is not my favourite nonetheless it was edible anyway. In fact, oyster not goes well with crispy deep fried ... IMHO. Service is typical of crowded restaurant in china town i.e. they expect you to eat fast and bill.for the one who looking for good tonkatsu restaurant. This is good place to go.Totally SGD4
2
My family visited the restaurant at takashimaya today for lunch. The eating experience disappoint us and we are not going back for sure.With 3 adults and 2 children, we placed 4 mains but they only took down 1 main and the side orders. We waited 5 minutes after the first set came and asked the waiter about our orders. He said there was no more orders and asked who took our order.... My goodness, it's lunch time and with 3adults and 2 children, how can we only have one set meal, tofu and salad..... When the food was served, the children cutlery was not served and one set of chopsticks missing. I think they should have repeat our orders and checked if we have the necessary cutlery to enjoy our food
5
We've been to the Shaw House, Takashimaya, Orchard Central branches and yes..the servings and taste are standard and consistent. I'd normally get set meal with hire katsu and oyster croquette. We'd noticed that they's periodically change the shredded cabbage dressing. Also try the house brand tea, it's refreshing
3
2nd of August 2013 at night at 7pm, I went to this Tonkichi restaurant at Shaw House hoping to have a regular dinner with my wife, after being seated, we noticed there's a bug inside the sauce and asked the hostess if we could change the sauce, she just stared at me and keep looking the sauce as if it's normal to have a bug in the sauce, I mean seriously it's not that difficult to change another sauce for us right? can they just hand us another piece of sauce first and have a look at her sauce as long as she want later on? why do that in front of customers? why bite the hands who feeds you? like it's our fault that we placed the bug in their sauce, seriously if I'm paying for the service tax and I'm getting all these terrible services, might as well I serve myself and save the stupid service tax, correct me if I'm wrong, she don't have a name tag, and she is not wearing any glasses, hope she gets what she wante
4
I have been an avid fan of Tonkichi for many years, and till date they have yet to disappoint. The staff are always friendly and eager to serve, food are served pretty fast, and always fresh. Hope it stays this way!
3
I always come to this branch whenever I visited Kinokuniya bookstore since 2005. This time kastu and the service was not up to the standard. I would expect more consistency from Tonkichi. I hope they will be better again on my next visit in December.
4
Sitting at the rest waiting for my food and writing this review :). Been to this restaurant for more than a year and this is one of the must go restaurant everytime i'm in Singapore. Try the katsu, u'll keep coming back for it.
4
Great food at great prices!, For lunch this is once place that yo can't go wrong with! The staff have also been very good and helpful, combined with amazing food!
3
The deepfried pork cutlets were tasty enough. Wasn't too impressed by the sashimi. Sushi-tei has better sashimi at a more reasonable price.
5
If you are looking for good breaded deep fried pork loin or fillet, this is THE place to be. Fresh ingredient and cook to perfection. Prices are on the high side but I havent found another Jap Restaurant that can deep fried the pork, chicken, prawn or oyster to this standard. Crispy on the outside and juicy inside.You can tell from it that they change the cooking oil regularly. Taste fresh taste and non greasy feeling.Worth every cents until a new competitor with the same standard arrives
5
350 Orchard Road, 4F Shaw HouseConsistently good Tonkatsu is served up here at Tonkichi Shaw House; we often visit before or after a movie and the quality never fails to delight. The food is delicious, pork and chicken are beautifully crumbed and tender. Service is good- a bit slow on busy nights...but worth the wait.Cold Sapporos go down nicely - a great accompaniment to our meal
4
It is about having a god quality typical deep fried pork Japanese set meal at vey reasonable price. This is what this restaurant is about.The restaurant is inside the Takashiyama department store is Orchard Road, and there is no view outside. You go there for your good lunch with very good food quality and attempting service. You get that all the time, t reasonable price. Try it

Tonkatsu or the Japanese cuisine cult celebrating the charms of the humble pork cutlet one of my favorite ways to pass time. It is therefore my considered opinion that Tonkichi's rendition is an honest effort at doing justice to the ingredient, Hire (fillet) or Rosu (loin). It all does start and end with the ingredient after all and that is why I am devoted to Japanese cuisine which celebrates the ingredient rather than the culinarian, and where culinary skill is measured in how well excellent ingredients are preserved unmolested by processing or the process.The pork is good, but I think that Tonkatsu Ma Maison across the street at Mandarin Gallery starts off with a better, more expensive product. The breading is light but the quality borders on mediocre, with smallish bread crumbs that are powdery rather than crunchy. Tonkatsu Ma Maison's cutlet has a more richly textured mouthfeel. The rice served at Tonkichi is superb. I believe this deserves mention because the experience at a tonkatsu joint is incomplete without good, properly prepared rice. Tonkichi's is al dente. You get to grind the sesame seeds to a consistency that you enjoy, employing a more traditional grinding technique rather than offering you with a handgrinder which just churns out uniformity which may not agree with your individual palate...nice touch, Tonkichi!I have to say that having had the chance to compare the service on a busy Friday evening in a head to head fashion between Tonkatsu Ma Maison at Mandarin Gallery and Tonkichi....the prize goes to Tonkichi! They moved more volume and did so by adroitly taking orders while patrons were in line and being Johnny-on-the-spot with refills of water, tea and beer. The superior cutlet at Ma Maison unfortunately is served by lackadaisical and unresponsive wait staff with the singular exception of a Japanese waiter by the name of Ken(?), who is no doubt swimming hopelessly against a sludgy tide.Bottom line is that I like the food better at Ma Maison, but not enough to brave the serpentine lines and slow service. That is why Tonkichi gets my vote for "Honest Tonkatsu Served Sincerely

It was my first time at the Isetan Scotts outlet and it has been a while since I last visited Tonkichi outlet at Suntec. It was busy as it was the 3rd Wednesday of the month so there is 25% off for Pokkacard members (and 10% off I think for the public).There are plenty of choices in terms of sets and combinations for pork katsu, chicken katsu and seafood katsu. There are also specials such as katsu with mentaiko (would probably try that next time), katsu curries and heathlier choices such as the ladies set (pork katsu stuffed with asparagus) and pork shabu shabu.I fancied the sesame and ponzu dips so ordered the shabu shabu set, which comes with an appetizer, chawamushi, miso soup, rice and fruits. The portions were just right and I really enjoyed the food. The rest of the party had a chicken and prawn katsu set, pork katsu set and a grilled fish set. The katsu sets comes with free flow of shredded cabbage (which tasted great with their special sauce and sesame seeds which you can grind in the little mortar bowl provided).The service staff was great, and regularly came by the table to top up the hot green tea.I can't comment much on the price as this was my friend's treat but the prices on the menu looked reasonable and with the 25% discount, it was even better.I certainly would want to return again, with or without the discount
4
I believe I've found my favorite place for tonkatsu! I visited the Isetan Scotts location. At first it looked pricey but dishes were big enough to share. In regards to the ambience though nothing really to write home about.
5
They stick to a few things they are good at and EXCEL at it. Free refills of (great) Japanese rice, (yummy) miso soup and (redeeming) cabbage. Try the Toji.
3
I do not like its overcharged price. There are other decent restaurants that charge LESS and the fried food they serve is equally delicious.
4
My husband's favourite since he doesn't like raw food.
Price is a little bit high, but food is delicious. I love the generous free flow helping of shredded veggies (I think cabbage) that you get as a salad with all that fried meat.
5
Grateful to live in Singapore and even happier to find a good meal at a decent price.I have been a regular patron of Tonkichi and usually patronize the outlets at Isetan Scotts and Takashimaya. The quality of the meat and seafood is consistently good, the service is prompt and professional. You get a pretty balanced meal in each set, you can have prawn with meat (chicken / pork katsu) and loads of crunchy vegetable with a yummy salad sauce. Rice, fruits and Hot Tea. And if you care to top up, change the soup to the radish pork based soup Tonjiru. They also have curry, noodle, 2 kids' meal and healthy options.Few restaurants keep the quality and freshness of the food consistent over years and years and I feel so gratified each time I have a good decent Tonkatsu meal at Tonkichi.I frequent Japan, the standard at Tonkichi is on par with Japan and may even exceed given the relatively spaciousness of the restaurant.Totally worth it
4
One the off putting points prior to deciding to come to this restaurant was the fact that it's located within the Takashimaya Shopping Mall on Orchard Rd. I expected overpriced , undersized portions. However I was pleased to see that it provided a good value ( by Sinapore standards) Japanese meal option for me and 3 friends who wanted to eat Japanese but didn't want to have to mortgage the house to do so. We ordered the Katsu selection for 3 + another dish with oroshi daikon on top. All told it was delicious.I have lived in Japan for 5 years and used to eat tonkatsu regularly. While there may be some time quibbles in presentation etc, this restaurant passes muster.Rice and cabbage refills are free as per the tradition in Japan
4
Went to this restaurant for dinner last night with great expectation after reading reviews on the Internet but I would sincerely say that the Katsu is only slightly above avg, a 3.5 out of a 5.I find the skin of the Katsu overfried and a tat too "golden". I still prefer the ones at Saboten. The set comes with a free flow of rice and cabbage. I found the salad sauce not to my liking and this is subjective. Prefer the thick sesame ones at saboten. They have 2 versions of salad sauce at saboten.Free watermelon slices after the meal too. Overall a 3.5 out of a 5
4
Tonkichi, one of the restaurant under Pokka group. The only thing I know about pokka is the green tea can drink. My friend introduce me to this place as she said it is famous for its black pig.The price is a bit higher if compare with normal Japanese Restaurant. Since it is famous for the black pig, so we must try it.We ordered 3 set of the Tonkatsu.Kurobuta Kata Rosu Set - Deep fried black pork shoulder loin, chawanmushi, appetizer, rice and miso soup. The black pig is from US.($28++). We substitute the miso soup with Tonjiru for $5.50++. Iberico Rosu Katsu Set - Deep fried Iberico shoulder loin, chawanmushi, appetizer, rice and miso soup. The black pig is from Spanish, fed on acorn.($28++)Katsu Zaru Soba Set - Cold Soba, deep fried pork fillet(3pcs), appertizer and chawanmushi ($24.90++)So what is different between the US & Spanish pork? Actually I cannot tell from outlook. However, I found that I prefer the Spanish one reason being I feel the US pork have stronger pork smell if compare to Spanish.Tonjiru tasted better than the normal miso soup. They added radish, carrot, meat, leek, toufu and there is one jelly like stuff which I cannot name it. It is better to consume when it is hot.After the meal, we are served with watermelon for our dessert
4
Love their katsu - crispy on the outside and tender and moist on the inside. The meat is cooked all round but retains its natural juiciness. They also did for me an excellent salt baked fish - not on the menu but if you request and the fish is available, they will oblige

We like the store in the Ngee Ann Center. The black pork, with perfectly cooked breaded batter is never too oily. Order the Hire for less fat. The standard version has tonkatsu sauce and you grate toasted sesame to mix with it. You can also order the soy-lemon flavored Ponzu sauce with grated diakon which is my favorite. Either way, you will get addicted

I remember the beef dishes done to perfection. I don't have good memories for the other dishes though.

My family have been dining at the Suntec outlet for many many times for Sunday lunch.The restaurant manager is always friendly and caters to make sure our dining experience and food is good. All the service staff are friendly and we have grown to make friends with them and unlike the usual high turnover at many restaurants, its nice to keep going to a familiar place and see familiar faces.The ambience is bright and cheerful.The food, by then, as we have probably been here almost 20 times in this year alone, must be quite boring. But no,,,,we always enjoyed what we ordered. The tonkatsu hire or rossu is always nicely-done, probably one of the best in Singapore. We esp like the complimentary cabbage with its own salad sauce. And my daughter's favourite, tonkatsu ramen with ebi tempura. She seems to be able to eat and slurp this everyday.Deserts are not their forte though and their ice-cream is lacklustre but everything else, from the food to the service, it feels great everytime we go back

Whenever I find myself in Singapore, then Tonkichi is most definitely part of my pilgrimage. No trip to this island state is ever complete without paying homage to this temple of porcine love. The meal in itself is almost ritualistic. First, they give you a mortar filled with sesame seeds which you grind into a powdery consistency. This is used to give additional aroma and flavor to the tonkatsu sauce. Then they serve you the warm miso soup to whet your appetite. Finally comes a golden sheet of kurobuta pork served with the most finely chopped greens imaginable. Each bites oozes with the rich taste of well-bred black hog -- a flavor that is not replicable by any other type of meat out there.I have since tried to have kurobuta elsewhere, but have not been fortunate to find a place that does it as well as Tonkichi can. They name says it all: Tonkichi is Tonkatsu, and Tonkatsu (without a doubt) is Tonkichi

Stopped here for lunch (350 Orchard) with a friend. I am a big fan of tonkatsu and it was well done here, which I guess surprised me given its chain restaurant status. They were very busy and the service was also excellent and fast. Very enjoyable lunch and I would very much recommend a visit

Good service at this branch, staff take initiative to ask on extra spinach and rice. Manager even offer complimentary potato salad when the dish take longer than usual to serve.Maybe the only thing is the quality of the black pork loion, I feel that the taste of it is better at the orchard central branch - it may be just my luck

The best tonkatsu in town
5
a lot of people still say that this is overpriced. but i've only eaten here once, and it made quite a memorable mark on my mind. the tonkatsu was lovely, as were the breaded oysters. i'd come again if i could muster up the cash.

I'm not a pork-eater, but their port cutlet set is so good that I actually don't mind having it once in awhile. My mom's boss (who's a japanese) even commented that this place serves one of the best tonkatsu (pork cutlet) in singapore. Do give it a try if you have a chance:

It's so good and authentic that i sign-up for it. Don't bother going to Tonkichi at Suntec City, it isn't the same there.
