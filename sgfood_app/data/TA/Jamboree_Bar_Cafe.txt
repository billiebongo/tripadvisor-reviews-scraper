Loved the music, but probably should tell you at the door it is a Hookers bar. Be sure to sterlise toilet before usingðŸ˜· Be careful what doors you go through ðŸ¤¢

Recently visited Jamboree with some friends great little spot, friendly staff relaxed atmosphere without the hassle of the girls like most bars in orchard towers.
Good spot for a quiet drink before heading out or hitting the other bars.

A country bar by the river. Great food and service with an in-house DJ taking your request. If you are into hot hats, boots and some rodeo ride. This will be the place to be!

This bar was a big disappointment . My friend and I were looking for a good place to have drinks and hear country music. It was filled with middle aged (mostly American) men flirting with young 'available' Asian girls. As with all bars in Singapore, beer is relatively pricey. So when one of the waitresses accidentally knocked over one of my beers, spilling over half of it on my friend's lap; it was a major waste. When I asked the waitress if I could have a new beer, since she was the one who had spilled it, she told me no, because she would have to pay for the beer out of her own pocket and she couldn't afford it. I was forced to pay for a beer that I didn't even get to drink

Great fun times with the only bar pool table we found. Plenty of good nights drinking and playing pool with great country style rock on the video screens. There are some of the 'girls' hanging around, but they are no trouble - a fine venue for couples

I came here first way back when Moby Dick was a sardine and Genevieve's was the other country bar in OT...those days.. incrediblly rowdy and boozy nights out before a visit to Top Ten; my only complaint was the smoke and having to visit the ATM too often. Now ten years later.. its a shadow of itself but we still like it. Now its a place you can safely tell the wife you have been to; good music, good food and the staff are very friendly. I always drink Jack (its impossible to replace it with a house pour due to its aroma and taste) and I have never had a problem there. You can still have a rowdy night, but its no longer wall to wall hookers, even if you want it to be. They dont play enough Outlaws or James Gang but wtf in sterile Singapore this place is still a good place to let out your inner cowboy and make a fool of yourself. Love it

I can't with good conscience give this place 5 starts because at the end of the day, it's a campy, loosely American-themed dive bar in a shady part of the Orchard Towers building.That said, it's a GREAT dive bar, with cold beers on tap, country music videos on the TV, and the best people watching I've had since Muddy Murphy's moved across town.It's not a place to bring people you want to impress; moreover it's a place to bring people you think might not be offended by a giant Confederate flag on the wall (sigh). Git your boots on and get ready for a dirty night if you head down to the ol' Jamboree

This bar has recently undergone an internal facelift. Whilst that's great a lot of the old rustic character of the bar has gone and what was once an after work flirty drinks venue for expats has become a sparsely patronized smorgasbord of ASEAN hookers. On entry I asked for a Bacardi on the rocks and a can of diet coke. What I got was a Bacardi on the rocks and a glass of flat warm coke from a can or bottle opened the day before and left with the lid off. The waitress insisted they don't sell cans and started provoking me by bumping my elbows while pretending to arrange the menus in front of me. She was obviously looking for a basis to have me removed. I took a look at other bars and returned to order the same and was delivered a can of coke and a Bacardi on the rocks by a different waitress. When I showed the original waitress that I finally got what ought to be a simple request she got very nasty. She's the short porky one if you go there!Apart from that it's great music and Mekong Delta hookers who trot around in high heels with their feet in a "ten to two" gait. Bring your corporate credit cards and cuff links to fit in

Was recommended by a friend to try out the wings... Country Jamboree claims to have one of the best (if not the best) fiery wings in town. When it comes to fiery, i'm always a little more than skeptical. Most joints pass off some mild spice mixed into really thick batter that just smothers the actual chicken.I was pleasantly surprised at Country Jamboree.... the wings were very nicely done and then smothered with their hot chilli paste. I love my spice and whoa was it fiery and it was oh so good. Can't wait to go back for more.I hear they're working on different levels of "fire". I can't wait... turn up the heat. Not for the faint hearted but to some it up.. AWESOME
