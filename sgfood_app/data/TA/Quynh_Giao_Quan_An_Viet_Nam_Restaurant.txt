Not sure why this place is not as busy as the other place further up Joo Chiat Road. Similar menus and prices. I think the food is comparable and no need to queue.

Very tasty food in a heritage part of town. I gave them 3 just because of poor plastic chairs that feel unsafe and mostly because the cleanliness. There are food crumbs and toothpicks letf behind customers on table. Pretty revolting.

My friend, a well-known food industry exec and former restaurant owner, took me to this place. The food--especially the cooked spring rolls and beef stew--were delicious. Eat here to enjoy Vietnamese cooking if you don't have a chance to visit Vietnam.
