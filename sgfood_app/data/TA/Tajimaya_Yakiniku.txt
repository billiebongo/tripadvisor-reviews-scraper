Servers were not very attentive. Food quality was okay, not the best. Wagyu beef is the most worth to eat item. Sashimi was okay too. Prawns not very fresh.

Low quality service, low quality food but high in priceThe restaurant is located in a busy shopping mall. And every table is spacious. I was filled with hope that dinner would be relaxing and fun. However, the horror starts after you placed your order. The staffs disappears. The service was non existent. I even got up and walk to cashier to get my bill. Only to hear many other customers complaining too. Wanted to give ourselves a treat, we ordered the premium beef but only to find the beef served frozen. And when we bbq it has a aftertaste that indicates it might have been defrost and frozen back again. The poor service and poor handling of food would definitely deter me from going back

The restaurant is operated by Filipinos and Indian. It clearly shows the labour crunch for Singaporean F&B industry. Staff overall attitude is unfriendly. The meat is served without the sauce. It is only when my Friend requested for it, then the sauces were served. We brought our bottle of red wine and we waited ages for the bottle to be opened. We requested for the wine to be chilled but it was long for them to bring the wine chiller. We ordered Miyazaki Short Ribs, Striploin and US Angus Beef. Overall Beef Quality is average. For the price that we paid at $65.80 per 100g, we would expect better quality.

Dining at Tajimaya in Singapore's Vivocity Mall used to be fun. Now it's just slow. Very slow on a Friday night. We thought it'd be a good idea to have their BBQ buffet but they were shorthanded and the food took forever to come. Even the changing of the charcoal took more than three requests before it happened. So the question is this: should bad service be forgiven because they were shorthanded, or, should they have welcomed diners when they can't provide a decent level of service? I understand high rentals in Singapore may force cutbacks in staff but this is exceptionally bad. Maybe I should take my patronage to another chain, Gyu Kaku, instead.

Tajimaya Yakiniku we visited on a busy Sunday at Vivo City and first impressions were great. The service was disappointing from the beginning and it never improved. When the food arrived the portions were very small and were not actually what we were expecting. The seafood was very disappointing although the beef was fine, overall the food was disappointing. By Singapore standards Tajimaya Yakiniku was very disappointing

Me and my wife looking for a dinner last thrusday 19/10/2017 and upon exploring restaurants we decided to ate in tajimaya in vivo city since we love beef and want to try different bbq buffet most of the time. First impression was good but the time they serve the meat we notice it was frozen but that time were fine to it.But during our bbq session we notice that the charcoal was not hot enough to cook our meat fast since its too frozen. So we ask for top up for it. But the times goes by after 4x time of asking for more charcoal no one does it and we've waiting for more than 30min still the charcoal didnt top up its like we grilling our meat in one piece of charcoal.time was on going and it started to loss our appetite. And me and my wife decided to ask for the bill. Coz it seem that there's no more chance to anticipate our needs. Even though we dont want to waste food but we cant eat frozen raw food aswell.We started 7:05pm we bill out 7:50 not even accumulate the 100min dinner time..Waste of time and money..Its ruined our dinner and bonding time

Wow!! never have I experienced such a poor service, we entered the restaurant at 20:00 (they were to close at 22:00) and believed that 2 hours would be sufficient.After ordering food and drinks for a total of SGD 300,- we ordered a selection of meats, seafood and sides the time had reached 20:30 when we got our food, at 21:00 we were asked to place the last order! Although the kitched didn't close till 21:30. (They were also still letting in people, I wonder how they felt?) at 21:20 I was asked to pay! Now we we're really stressed, I handed in my credit card, which dissapeared for 10 minutes?? Before I had to ask for it to get it. Food though was fantastic, so if you are able to go there at 18:00 I guess the total will be good

The average food quality is good. Wagyu beef is very tasty, Angus beef is a bit dry, tiger prawn size is good. Lamb is original taste. Salmon is ok. Tuna is very dry, not fresh.Service is damn slow, every 10-15min will get the ordered dish. And most of dishes are missing. If you order vega it might be in time, if you order beef, then need to wait until sleepy... the service standard is Low, service staff is not well trained. Not as good as $1.5/plate sashimi one.Service staff never take initiative to refill the soup or clear the plate. Ordered 8 portion beef, only 4 came in the end. Must keep ordering... passion fruit drink is diluted. Wifi password is not written. Not convenient for travelers. review in TripAdvisor is too much than actual. Diners shall read those in Google maps. That's more accurate.What a shame to have such bad service level as an Japanese restaurant

Dropped by at Vivo City and noticed that this restaurant was busy for lunch so me and my friends decided to dine, upon entrance we were welcomed with the smile and greetings from the staff. when the food was served i was amazed with the quality of the miyazaki rib eye match with miso soup and garlic fried rice. affordable price with good quality service and perfect dine in experience

Me and Wife dine at Tajimaya situated in a busy Mall at Vivo City, but once we get in you will have a piece of heaven. A must try there their wagyu beef, it is a bit pricey a may say but its worth every inch of the meat. And the best part is you will get the chance of cooking your own food without smelling smoke afterwards. Their customer service is amazing even we went to peak hours they still manage to provide us good and quality Service..

Tajimaya Yakiniku in Vivo City offer very high quality Japanese Beef for their BBQ Set . If you want good meat, then opt for this Japanese Beef as it melts in your mouth with good taste

Visited this outlet for some good bbq. We ordered the wagyu beef set at $158 for two.
Meat quality is good and I can see the marbling on the beef. However services were slow but manager Edward tried to rectified the issue immediately.

This is the 2nd visit to this restaurant after more than 1.5yrs.It was my wife's birthday and she said she wanted to have BBQ dinner and my wife recalled having dine in this restaurant before.Although I made reservations for a seat near the window but we were ushered to a seat at a corner with no windows so we requested for a change of table. The restaurant wasn't even 1/4 full with window seats readily available but we were not given seats there as requested which is weird.The waiter by the name of Uben attended to us and I must say that this young chap is very diligent, always smiling and hardworking. I am very impressed by his enthusiasm and sincerity though he was a little shy and soft spoken. We took Uben's recommendation of the Japanese Beef Set for 2 and food was serve promptly.First came the salmon sashimi and one look, you'll be able to tell that the salmon wasn't fresh and likely frozen before as the color was darker and lacks the fatty shine. The salmon was also way too cold to be served as sashimi.Then came the salad which was great coz my wife and myself really liked the dressing.We were also given 3 dipping sauces which consist of a spicy chili sauce, lime juice and the last I believe is soy sauce. I am disappointed at the lime juice as they gave bottled lime juice which is sweeten instead of fresh lime juice.We also had miso soup, garlic rice and chawamushi but the chawamushi was another disappointment as it was way too watery.The beef that we had was passable but definitely not the type of beef you'll expect when you order "Japanese wagyu" and it's costlier than the US wagyu stated in the menu.Portioning was good but quality can definitely be improved. There was another cut of beef that was on the plate and I believe it is tenderloin but it looked unusually red in color so I believe food coloring may have been added to give it the "fresh" look.Overall, the food was below average but I gave an average rating due to the service provided by the waiter

We thoroughly enjoyed our evening at the restaurant. The manager recommended us the beef and pork set which included sashimi, sushi, tempura, miso soup, steamed egg, and a variety of meat cuts sliced perfectly for grilling. The equality of the meats were commendable and the seasoning was very tasty. The service was friendly and efficient. Will come back again if same discounts were on offer

Nice beef items on the buffet menu. Tiger prawn were large size and the sashimi especially the salmon is orange bright appetising color. Really enjoy the food there.Average spend for two is $120 incl tax etc so a bit steep similar to hotel pricing. Service staff average and rather slow. Manager was nice and polite

We tried this restaurant and actually only wanted the dons and udons. However, after looking at the menu we decided to try the pork BBQ for 2 set. The set comprises a salad, chawamushi, tempura, fried rice, desert and of course the pork platter offering a variety of cuts. The restaurant was 60% full and service was quite immediate. We liked what we had and will definitely come back

I am a regular visitor to Tajimaya vivo city when in Singapore. I love their meats. Plus I am friends with Eddie and Edward. Both of them are superb hosts and provide an impeccable service. 5 stars to them. I am a world traveler hence would know quality of a restaurant

Today 25/3/16 at about 12.50pm, my wife and I visited this restaurant as we wanted to have Japanese BBQ. Though this is not the usual restaurant we normally go for jap BBQ, we decided to give it a try. In less than 10mins we ordered the weekend brunch buffet, i.e. Beef, prawns, vegetables, salmon and rice. About 10mins later, a couple was ushered to the table beside us. Another couple with two kids were ushered to another table beside us 5mins after that. As I witnessed, both families place their orders 5mins later.At 1.20pm, the waitress served the food to the first couple that arrived 10mins later than us. Initially, i thought they ordered different food but when I checked they too ordered the weekend brunch buffet and had some similar food items to what we ordered. I checked with the waitress and she said "sorry the kitchen was jammed up with orders" and walked away. I was astonished!! Yes it's lunch time and the kitchen is busy with orders but isn't it first come first served? Especially so for same or similar orders. We decided to be patient. Then the family of four got served their food and they too ordered the buffet with similar food items that we ordered.That's it!!! We are so pissed and decided to leave. The waitress told us again to be patient for our food but no way and we walked out. This will be the first and last we will even walk into this restaurant!!

Ordered the Wagyu Beef Set for 2 pax - Food arrived fast. Asked for recommendation for sake, which the waitress was not very sure on which to recommend (had to ask their manager to recommend).Prawns and scallops were the freshest. Wagyu was okay.Recommend to go earlier during dinner time, before the big groups start to come in.P.S. It was quite warm inside the restaurant

Visited Tajimaya for the Weekend Lunch Buffet @ $54/pax after tax and service charge. I enjoyed the dinner I had here last year and was very happy to find out they now offer weekend lunch buffets. Overall the quality and offerings of the buffet makes the price great value for money. The Wagyu Beef and Tiger Prawns will satisfy your craving for surf and turf.However, the service standard at Tajimaya needs to be reviewed. After being seated, none of the waiters/manager bothered to bring the menu to our table. They also consistently avoided eye contact and calls from other tables. When our orders were finally taken, we were made to wait 15 minutes before the food was served. There was certainly no heart when taking orders as many times our orders were either forgotten or we were served the wrong dishes or in small portions.-A short snippet of the All-You-Can-Eat Menu-Meat:Wagyu Beef, US Angus, Kurobata Pork Collar/Loin, Duck, Chicken and LambSashimi:Salmon, Tuna, Swordfish etcOthers:Tiger Prawns, Shishamo, Cuttlefish, Vegetables, Garlic Rice, Apple/Orange Juice and Green Te
