I grabbed a shot black on the way past as I was between flights and need the concentrated coffee hit
4
Orders were taken quickly and prepared immediately. Quality was very good and the selection of food was well presented.

This is a good airport Starbucks at Changi Singapore. The coffee is good.The prices similar to other ones. The service is good.
5
Had a good mocca cafe @ Starbucks ... Same delight and taste anywhere in Starbucks whether in Sydney/Chicago/Singapore ....

We decided to have a quick meeting in airport Starbucks (it was in T1). We have got there what we expected. Nothing more, nothing less. Cleaning of the tables was bit delayed. But generally OK
3
It's nicely tucked away from the big crowds with sufficient place for many transit passengers to sit and enjoy a coffee. The eats were nothing much to enjoy.
4
Usually I don't eat muffins,but I see this combination apple cheddar and Parmesan and I was curious to tryThen I buy one,I feel the taste and juice of apple with the cheddar on the back for finish with the Parmesan Wow very good !!!

Good as always to perk up your day. Coffee. Music. Service. WiFi. All the same, across the board, good customer service whenever I am here passing through. You will always know what you are going to get. This is Starbucks, what more can you ask for

It was in the morning and i have to catch my next flight in 1 hrs time and i wanted to have a quick coffee, So i was looking for a coffee shop and i came across to Starbucks Changi, and i like the Mocca Cafe of Star bucks
1
Ordered Latte with extra shot, i could not taste the coffee, i returned the drink and they appologized and called supervisor , to inform that they had yet another complaint about weak coffee, they added 2 more shots, but this still was not good, why be so greedy , if you are aware your equipment is faulty , appologize and stop serving until repairs are carried out, from now on i will avoid all Starbucks outlet

Good place while waiting your flight with college, service is good, my fav frappucino caramel, price sgd 6,8. Enjoy your trip

If I am on expense account, this is a must stop over. Otherwise, I will head for the Airport Staff canteen for my coffee & milk tea, local style

I love going to Starbucks but the outlets is Chnagi Airport Transit area do not allow me to use the Starbucks card.
1
I'm a regular Starbucks customer but I get irritated when I want to buy a cup of coffee here but they wouldn't allow me to use my Starbucks card and get loyalty points here.

You can have alight snack and coffee. During rush hours, you may not get place. But, overall nice transit zone. Snacks are good and tasty and coffees and ever green and tasty......
3
In the basement of T3, it is your usual Starbucks in the middle of the shopping area. Unless you are really keen to have the familiar, skip and head a little further down to the wonderful and typical Singapore food court.
4
While I don't have a problem with the coffee or other drinks provided I do wish that the dine in option was with proper cups not disposable paper ones, not quite as nice

Great to see Starbucks at the departure lounge so I knew I could get a great coffee. In the rush to get to the airport in time, I hadn't had breakfast and even the breakfast specials for coffee and something to eat were available. I often find in airports overcharging, but thought the simple breakfast frittata, great filtered coffee from Sumatra (on this day), plus wifi, all made for a de-stress before my flight

Great to relax at Starbucks in Transfer D and enjoy a coffee that you know is going to be just the way you like it. And......they do all sized flat whites! Yay! So pleased about that because they do not in the UK very clean and efficient service -Wifi too so even better

This is referring to the Starbucks at the Arrival Hall, in the B2 level public area. It is possibly in the end next to the fountains and the Dunkin Donuts outlet. This was our first breakfast halt before we hit Singapore. Efficient and amazingly silent during early morning hours (its a 24 hour outlet)

You can always rely on Starbucks for great coffee. Had the new caramel ribbon frapp mmmm. Always my fIrst stop when I arrive at Changi. Thankful for Starbucks

Good place, convenient location, friendly staff, and nothing to say about the coffee, yes its Starbucks. Always fresh.
5
and if you like fast and efficient service, look no further. There is also a nice seating area. The food looked good, but we only had coffee.
3
Would be good if Starbucks took.some.more space here so it can better handle the.volume of customers. Also no.WiFi is strange for a Starbucks. Coffee bean in Terminal 3 was better
5
The service etiquette in Singapore is fantastic but this place exceeds expectations.Very helpful staff knows how to handle tired travelers so well.
5
always look for a Starbuck's - Superb coffee as always, great place to grab a coffee and check your emails.

Just another Starbucks. Nothing special about this place but its long long long queue. Well, probably because it's located in the airport. What disturbed me was the cleanliness. There were too many empty cups and plates left by visitors (ignorance is a bliss?). The baristas and servers were too busy preparing order so no one cleaned the mess

This particular Starbucks is located at the departure area lobby of the Changi airport. We had a late night departure time out of Singapore. We stayed at the hotel as long as possible and head out to the airport by subway. When we arrived at the airport, it was still too early to check-in. We found this conveniently located Starbucks. The place was crowded but fortunately, we found a spot. Got my regular drink, a tall bold with room for sugar and creamer. They did not have a scanner to pay by smartphone which is bad and good at the same time because we were trying to burn our leftover Singaporean dollar anyway. Hereâ€™s the kicker though.......NO WIFI!!!! A Starbucks without wifi is a semi-Starbucks

This is a terrible place, overcrowded and uninviting to look at. The staff is unfriendly, the place is not cleaned up, the quality of the coffee served is unacceptable and by far not up to the declared standards of Starbucks. Despite all of this I found my visit rather interesting. It is a textbook case of a marketing concept executed in the wrong place. Starbucks simply does not fit into an airport such as Changi. Clients are in a hurry, tired, nervous and smelly when the come from intercontinental flights. Nobody is there to relax and have a friendly chat with the usually nice and welcoming Starbuck staff. Starbucks should better close down the place since it does not any good to their brand

When you are traveling and want a break from the extraordinary, Starbucks is consistently like stumbling on an old friend who doesn't let you down. This one has a unique spot by an electric fountain and light show; Not your usual settings for an airport coffee sho
