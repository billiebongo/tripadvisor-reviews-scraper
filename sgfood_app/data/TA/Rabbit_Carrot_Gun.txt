Popped in for brunch - eggs benedict, very good indeed, washed down with a glass of house white, very pleasant way to spend an hour watching the world go by.

I had breakfast here with a friend. Nice coffee and fresh juices too. This place is rather small but busy. Service was fast and friendly. Richard really tried his best to make the customers happy. Oh, they have a good and clean toilet too.

Having spent my time in the UK as a student, naturally I craved for some British Food ever so often. RCG proved to be an excellent place to whet my appetite for anything English.The sausages and mash were full of flavour, especially the gravy. The fish and chips (not quite chips, fries, rather) were crisp and juicy, though I don't quite like the presentation, as it is a bit difficult to cut the fish without the fries spilling everywhere out of the plate.The truffle fries are a must-try, one of the best I've had anywhere thus far. (Not pictured) I prefer its subtle hint of truffle oil in RCG's version.Recommended to those who know and understand English flavours and don't mind a bit of variety

Had a very nice breakfast at Rabbit Carrot Gun with my husband and miss 6. The food was nice. Service great. Food arrived promptly. Yes the coffees (as they are everywhere in Singapore) were expensive but so so worth it. Would visit again next time in Singapore

Called in here for lunch. Really quirky funky cafe. My wife had the Salad Nicoise which had proper slices of seared tuna, not the usual stuff from a tin! I had the crab cakes served on a salsa with aioli. Really delicious. The menu was very interesting and the dishes sounded delicious. A simple cafe serving excellent food

We were on the way to our hotel in the pouring rain, after arriving in Singapore only two hours before. We were soaked and just wanted to put our bags down and grab something quick to eat, but we were greeted with delicious comfort food and fabulously warm service. We had sausages and mash and shepherds pie, sharing a bowl of green beans tossed in butter. With a pint of Tiger and a soft drink, the bill came to $72, which is a smidge steeper than we would normally want to pay but we appreciated the warm reception that we received from the staff and the opportunity to dry off. Probably won’t eat here again but that’s because we’re only here a few days.
1
I was already in Singapore when my reservation was canceled leaving me with no place to go for the last 3 days of my trip. No communication from Richard's part (which is either the owner or manager of this place), no reliability, absolutely no care. I seriously doubt anyone in charge, acting like he did, can back up a good business. Singapore is a great country, don't waste your time or money in this spot

The event we attended here was atrocious. It had so much potential at 88++ a head one would expect to at least taste the competitors eggs. They’re professional chefs I’m sure their kitchens could have knocked up a few bite size morsels for guests to taste. The eggs and winners became totally irrelevant.Couldn’t hear or see anything, if you think I’m exaggerating the even was in two separate rooms so that show how inclusive it was. There was no description of how or why the chefs designed their eggs, no audience participation, nothing. I could have run this event with my eyes closed. Guests could have easily filled in feedback forms as the extra judge. How can we attend a competition and not know a single thing about what’s going on! Even a brochure on each table for goodness sake. Service was absolutely terrible but we still managed to spend a small fortune drowning our sorrows. The free flow canapés were a joke, I don’t call the skinniest fries I ever saw- with zero sauces or salt available a canapé. It was an absolute rip-off and a complete sham.I will never go there again and will spread the word. Trust me, the chefs were embarrassed, I saw their faces

This quaint restaurant/bar (RCG + Trenchard arms) offers exceptional food and a relaxed atmosphere to enjoy it. The food mainly comprises of British styled nosh with a twist. Don't expect to find bottled Ketchup here. Home made tomato relish is the name of the game here.The menu is well thought out and there are always regular specials to choose from if the menu doesn't tickle your fancy. Personally I think they make the best burger in Singapore. Their weekly Sunday roast special is well known on the East Coast and very well attended.Decent variety of beers on tap. They also organise various events like whisky tasting, quiz nights and foody experiences. It all adds to the fun.Head on over

Singapore is a relaxing stop to decompress before returning to the US after a couple of weeks in Asia. It's a westernized (and somewhat artificial) contrast to the more natural reality of the other nations in Asia that we visit once a year. This time we were coming from a wonderful time in Bhutan and Kathmandu. The east side of Singapore (Katong) area is very interesting and a quieter section of the city-state. You could say it is more authentic since it is a bit less developed. We like it very much
5
Really good place for a taste of the UK. Had the scotch egg, sausage roll & roast dinner (Sunday only). All excellent along with really friendly owner/manager and decent cocktails. Recommended!!
4
Great to watch first Rugby while having some beers. Afterwards dinner in the Restaurant. Atmosphere in the Pub is nice. Food at the Restaurant is good.
5
Wonderful service, very friendly. The food is also great. I like their appetizers. A must try in Singapore.
1
Terrible. Just went to their Scotch Egg event with 'free flow' canapes. In 3 1/2 hours we were fed less than one scotch egg and endless chips. I left hungrier than I arrived - and they still charged $88!+GST per person! This is the worst dining experience I have ever had in Singapore. Considering how bad the service normally is in Singapore, this is impressive. I would not recommend this place to anyone. Rabbit Carrot Gun should be ashamed of themselves
5
We actually came by this restaurant because we stayed upstairs using AirBnB. Wasn't expecting much but gave it a go and was really blown away. First off the service was fantastic. As we were staying upstairs they got to know us on a first name basis yet observed they were equally attentive to all their customers. Gave great advise on what to see and where to go but the food is what kept us coming back. Had breakfast lunch and dinner over the 3 days we were there and each time were thoroughly satisfied. Catered for my vegan partner to her satisfaction and even helped me through a hangover! Will definitely be going again when next in Singapore. Many thanks to Richard, Victor and their team
5
Staying around the corner this is an ideal oasis amongst the many available. Breakfasted twice here so far, good service, pleasant surroundings to watch the world go by. Excellent menu with plenty of choice, ideal set up for a day of sightseeing. Thank you Richard. To get the Carrot.

Breakfast, brunch, dinner, cocktails - this place has it all. My husband and I have visited a few times and every experience has exceeded the last. The food is some of the best western food in Singapore- smashed avocado, Beef Wellington and the scotch eggs are my top picks, but everything is delicious and some really unique dishes! We originally came in for lunch and then stayed for a few glasses of afternoon prosecco and we could have stayed for dinner!!
5
So satisfying brunch on a Sunday morning. We went there without reservation and got a place outside. It was a bit hot and humid without the blind ( realised only later could put the blinds ) but the food more than compensated for the heat. The food is just excellent. After a Long time had some good quality food . Every meal was excellent and so was the service. Would definitely go there again . In fact planning to book it this time for Sunday morning for a bigger group so that we can get to taste all in the brunch menu . Try and book in advance for a place inside. The food just made us all so happy
3
We came here for lunch. We stood there for quite some time and no one approached us for seating arrangements. There are sufficient empty tables around and I resorted to just walk in. Only then did their staff noticed us and seated us.We order BAS sandwich, Angus Rib eye and Cappucino. BAS sandwich is okay but not great. Rib eye is a tad too salty. Cappucino is good.Next time, will mentioned less salt when ordering the Rib eye
5
Stopped by Rabbit Carrot Gun a few times on my last trip to Singapore for breakfast, lunch and a few beers. The food and the coffee were consistently excellent (the burger in particular) along with the atmosphere which consists of a nice mix of locals, expats and tourists. The owner and his staff went out of their way to make sure that everything was perfect! Definitely worth a visit if you find yourself in Katong
2
Watery eggs , tasteless breakfast, concerning downslide from last visit
Coffee was nice and the only saviour for this visit: I hope they pick up their game
5
This is a hidden gem in amongst a see of Singaporean food. We had the Australian Rib Eye and the Prosciutto Wrapped Chicken Breast which were perfectly cooked. Service was the best. We will be going back for breakfast and dinner.
3
Overall was very good but would have been better if they served an extra piece of toast with the 2 eggs your way. Value for money - 6/10. Food quality was very good.
4
Nice to sit outside and watch people walking by, sipping glass of Chardonnay.Try the Rib Eye steak it is delicous.
3
I travel to Singapore on business regularly and have recently started staying in Katong.
The food here is really good but the service is poor when the owner doesn't appear to be around.
Sort it out or I will get put off.
5
I went here just yesterday and the food was. Incredibly good. I ordered the eggs Benedict with an ice chocolate and both were delicious definitely would recommend this place for a breakfast.
2
I had been to the RCG and its neighbouring pub (The Trenchard Arms) twice before and had enjoyed my visit on both occasions: Very good food, friendly yet unobtrusive service, nice, homely setting, engaging owner, all pretty good!However, yesterday I ordered an open-faced steak sandwich from the for dinner using Deliveroo, i.e. for delivery to my home. When the food arrived I quickly found out that the meat was of very low quality: it looked and tasted as if it consisted of 40-50% sinews, gristle, then there was some fat, and only the balance was actual meat. Each bite I took was a let-down, especially considering that it was not a cheap dish either (SGD25.68)! I honestly doubt they would have dared to serve me the same piece of meat if had been sitting in the restaurant in person, so last night's experience was simply disappointing. I will not order from them again
4
Good coffee, yummy smoothies and tasty brunch. I had the Koo Koo Ca Choo, which was well prepared and just right. On a previous visit, I had the Rabbit's Greens salad. Again, it was good! On occasion, the eggs can be watery and the service slow, even if staff are friendly. But otherwise, a relaxing little cafe on a side-street.
4
Good food, coffee, service, and atmosphere.A little disappointed with the full breakfast, which cam with one piece of toast the size of a biscuit. They were happy to bring a second piece, but the bread choice needs improvement. Also the sausage was small and not as tasty as everything else
1
Not very pleased with the service. Food was okay, but the service was horrendous. Asked one of the waiter to help us take a polaroid photo, while trying to explain how to use the camera, he shushed us and said he knows how to. And he clicked on the shutter while we were still trying to pass the camera to him, so we had a partial selfie of that waiter as a "souvenir". When we questioned him why did he press down on the shutter and why did he say that he knew how to use it, he got angry and said that he would just pay for it - which he never did (not that we were expecting anything from him). Not only was there no apologies from him, he flared up at us. We wanted to get the camera back from him and he just walked away from us WITH the camera still in his hands. We were so scared he would continue to press the shutter. He passed the camera to another colleague and walked away angrily. The meal would have been a pleasant one if not for that Filipino server. Unfortunately, the food was not sufficiently good for us to overlook the poor service. I believe there are other places along the stretch of shops with better service, food and price
4
went there to have late lunch early dinner I had the fish and chips and the food was delicious. it does the job
2
I was here for lunch on a weekday with my family. Coffee was good. But the rest of the food orders took too long to be served out. Aside from our party of four, there was a couple occupying another table and later the odd few customers started streaming in. The staff on duty just could not cope by himself to take orders, get and serve the drinks, and take payments from customers etc. I was expecting a quick and efficient lunch but it turned out otherwise because of the poor service and slow turnaround of the food orders. The dining experience was also a let down due to the taste of the food. Aside from the salad (which was the best out of our selections), the bacon avocado stilton ciabatta sandwich was buttered way too generously and the fish for the fish n chips somehow had an oily crispy batter but a soggy fish inside. The chips appeared to be just the usual frozen straight cut chips thrown into the fryer. I was expecting real British fish n chips but sadly, no. :( Perhaps we chose the wrong kind of dishes that day. But I am doubtful I will drop by again.

We like to try different restaurants for brunches around East coast, and this is one with some positive reviews on google. I went there with my two teen kids last weekend. We arrived around 1:30 p.m on Sat. Not too many clients. The waitress was quite impatient - she quickly read through some dishes recommendation, and I could barely understood. She was so motionless on her face that I almost thinks she is a robot. The pumpkin soup and the crab cake is good, but the lamb pie was quite bood. Beef burger is ok. The refresher juice is good as well. Got a feeling that this might be a good place to have a glass of beer or a drink with friends, but not for family. We finsihed our lunch and left asap. Guess we picked a wrong place for family meal..
4
This is a very convivial bar and restaurant. The menu is perhaps a little British but this does not put off a great cross section of customers. The owner Richard is helpful, amusing and well supported by his efficient staff.We had two Sunday lunches, on different Sundays of course, both were excellent. Washed down by Asahi beer. It is also a good place to have a beer and watch the World go by. will be back in September
5
Empty at time of visit. My husband and I had breakfast. I had the special poached eggs and black pudding. V good. Place very small so would advise booking for a guaranteed seating. service exceptional but to be expected as no other customers. Price equal to other venues of this type. Food western, not outstanding, but as it should be. Not a stand out venue, however give it a go as you won't be disappointed, but you won't come away thinking wow either
1
Echoing an earlier review, we encountered an appalling customer attitude by the antipodean manager/owner.We wanted to sit inside as it was hot outside. We were about to be shown to a table, when I informed him that we were visiting primarily for a coffee. At this point he told us that we could not have a table inside as "coffee is hot". This was despite the fact that:- There was plenty of room inside- It was around 11am, so not an unreasonable time to want a coffee/snack rather than a full lunch- We had a baby, infant and 2 senior citizens in our party and it was too hot for them outsideThe man's behaviour was driven by greed and revealing that we primarily wanted a coffee made him think that he was not going to maximise profit from that table over the next hour or so. He frankly did not give two hoots about anything else. We had no option but to leave and find somewhere else.I don't care how good the food or drink is or not, if that is the attitude of this establishment to prospective or existing customers, they do not merit a visit. There are plenty of other places in the area with both good food/drink/atmosphere and a great approach towards their customers
3
Lovely pub with a good menu of classic dishes, I had something for lunch there - the stake sandwich and was lovely, but you would definitely want to order some sides as it didn't fill me on its own. Also has a good choice of drinks and cocktails.
5
This is a favourite haunt for me and my better half. We love the atmosphere, friendly staff, food and range of drinks - I like the earl grey martini and pepper G&T. Plus the Green Devil IPA is awesome.A great feature of the RCG (and next door Trenchard Arms) is the genuine innovation they apply to a pub\bistro menu! Vegetarian scotch eggs - they use avocado not sausage meat! Perfectly cooked soft boiled eggs. Loved it! We keep coming back....
5
Excellent food, Friendly service and plenty to do around the area. Meals were slow coming out but given it was a Sunday bunch and how busy the restaurant was. It was well worth the wait. Owner manager is a cracker. For kicks, try asking him if there's fried rice on the menu. Good for families, couples and groups. Slice of England in Singapore
5
We had an excellent experience at this restaurant! We found the restaurant via Google and we're glad we ate there. We even went back a 2nd & 3rd time. When getting ready to write this review I noticed a couple of the prior poor reviews. Interestingly the first time we tried to eat breakfast here they were closed for an all day training. The service from everyone, including the husband and wife owners was wonderful. This was the best service we experienced in Singapore. The breakfasts were very tasty and also went there for coffee and dessert in the evening. Based on our experience I would not hesitate to recommend this place
4
Just walk by and found this shop. Try their Shepard Pie and their Lava Cake is wonderful. Will re-visit this place again
3
I tried the Avocado Smash, it was just nice but rather pricey. The juice is good and worth the price
1
How can a manager / owner drive out his own guests? We are repeat customers and we were having brunch for only a little over an hour. Normal good brunch timing. He came to our table saying we are occupying the tables and we should leave as there were other customers. VERY DISAPPOINTING. WE ARE NOT COMING BACK. BEWARE OTHER CUSTOMERS...they expect you to eat there for only 15mins fastfood style.
5
We visited twice after travelling for 2 1/2 months through parts of SE Asia, the first time were looking for a nice meal and wine to match. The waiter in the restaurant was great, taking us through the specials and ensuring all was satisfactory during our time there. We could not fault the meals we had or the wine, our waiter (Mark) also explained what was happening over the next few days including the roast on Sunday. The next day after a good walk around Joo Chit we stopped in the bar for a couple of cold beers, and as there were a few Aussies and Kiwis there they changed the channel to the rugby game that was on in NZ which was a nice touch. It appeared a few expats stop in frequently and we could see why as it had a good vibe
2
I arrived about 10 minutes before my 2 friends and was greeted by a nice waiter at the entrance. He asked me whether we would like to be seated outside or inside and I told him to give me a second while I texted my friends. At that point there were plenty of tables available inside and outside. The same waiter kindly asked if I wanted to just take a seat inside in the meantime so I said ok. As I was walking in, I was physically stopped by a caucasian man (presumably the owner).Him: Hold on darling, how many are you?"Me: Table for 3 pleaseHim: Are all your friends here?Me: They are on the way.Him: I'm sorry, we can only seat you when everyone is here.And he ushered me out.What policy is this?1) I went in because your staff invited me to a seat while waiting for my friends.2) Your restaurant was mostly empty when I arrived at 3.45pm and I did not see any reserved cards on the table.3) It's not a smart move in general because there is a chance people would order food and drinks while waiting for friends i.e. more business for the cafe. I can't say the same about the rest of the staff but this guy's actions were obnoxious and it turned me off. Suffice to say, I would never visit them again.
2
We waited close to an hour to get a couple of cups of coffee. And the wait staff had a terrible attitude. The owners, presumably don't care much for locals or tourist as there were other disgruntled tables all waiting for their food and drinks.Cook interior design. Pity the experience was terribl
5
Found it by accident as the hotel we booked into turned out to be halal and alcohol free, Luckily this bar was just opposite the hotel, the staff are very friendly with the pub and its restaurant next door having a good selection of pub food and snacks

I frequented this restaurant last evening after seeing it many times while walking through Joo Chiat. We were greeted warmly by a staff member and shown to our table. He then showed us the daily specials on his i-Pad. A nice touch , and we were off to a good start.Things went downhill from there. The waiter (Clarence) was miserable. He never once cracked a smile and seemed bothered when we asked him questions about the tomato ketchup. We both ordered the fish an chips. I asked for tomato ketchup and was advised the sauce in the small dish was their own home made ketchup. I asked what was in it because it didn't taste at all like tomato. he didn't know but said he would ask. He came back and read off the ingredients. I asked if there was "normal" tomato ketchup and he said " no" and walked away. He was very busy with other customers and did not want to invest the time in making sure we were ok with his response. OK so we carried on without traditional tomato ketchup (please at least keep a bottle on hand for those that ask for it). The fish was very nice , but my fries had a taste of truffle oil - which I was not expecting. I do not like truffle oil. Some of the fries were ok and some tasted like truffle. Maybe they were cooked in a pan that was used for your other truffle fries on the menu?The mushy peas were dry not much flavor.Our only other interaction with Clarence was when we asked for the bill. He simply plopped it down on the table put a pen on top and walked away. Saying nothing. Very rude if you ask me. Our bill was S$130 - and i would have expected a bit better service than we got. When Clarence came back to collect the bill we asked him if we had done something to offend him . He laughed and said " oh I am only one person very busy"Needles to say - it did not leave us feeling we would want to return any time soon. Not even a thank you when he took the bill.I appreciate it is not easy when short staffed , but remember we are there to enjoy a meal and a bottle of wine. Not our fault. Thanks

I visited here on my final weekend visiting my daughter in Singapore. We were greeted warmly by the owner and the menu explained. I chose a traditional Sunday beef roast. The food was beautiful the quality and cooking of all elements was superb. I didnot manage dessert but my daughter and son in law s desserts were again outstanding.Thoroughly recommen
1
I heard of this place through some friends and was told that the place was average. No complaints about the staff but in my opinion the brunch was very below average. I had the smashed avocado and it tasted as if I cooked it myself in my own kitchen, everything made with basic ingredients.
5
Friendly owner, tentative service not to mention how delicious our lunch was. I had chicken club with caramelized onion - hands down super moist and flavourful! good selects of beer - they even have Kilkenny from cork here. Really worth stopping by!
5
Love this place .Food is excellent,and owners are super nice .Great for family lunches .
Child friendly.
4
Lovely setting here- the staff are happy to let you laze about and relax. Fans and blinds on the balcony to keep you comfortable. The coffee was decent and the avocado with feta was yum- good quality bread and nicely poached eggs
4
Great spot along East Coast Road for coffee, brunch or lunch. Good varied menu, reasonable prices and an Aussie making the coffee so it's better than most LOL! Good veggie options too.
5
Loved the food here. A great piece of English and Asia European fusion dishes......we took our two young teenage boys and they loved it. They pour a very good pint of Asahi Super Dry too....Owner was attentive and passionate about the quality of the food. we were fortunate that there was a special menu on from a guest chef....bravo guy
5
It is a small cafe that would have been easily missed but the food are great! Yummy brunch except the sourdough bread seems abit hard for me but my baby loved it! The boss is super friendly and it is has a very relaxed atmosphere! The open steak sandwich is very generous with its beef and the shooting breakfast and toast are equally superb! Will visit if going to the east again! Best to reserve a seat as the cafe is pretty tiny
5
Desperate to escape the Holiday Inn horrible halal breakfast and mob scene, this place was recommended by Berg's Gourmet Burgers next door as the best breakfast in the neighborhood. I was not disappointed! I dropped in at 9:00 Sunday morning, their busiest time, and though reservations were "required", the owner graciously found me a table.I enjoy a large, high-protein breakfast, and this was WONDERFUL! I ordered two eggs over easy (perfectly cooked), with a side order of bacon (English style, also perfect), and hash browns. I ordered a ketchup for the potatoes, and the homemade sauce was so good, I ended up eating with a spoon. And their homemade sourdough bread was so good I want another slice right now! Breakfast included coffee, which was a cappuccino that would shame Starbucks. And my waitress was a gorgeous, possibly Russian lady who would make the trip worthwhile even if the food were mediocre.They also serve a full English breakfast, including mushrooms and beans, and I kept hearing about their amazing "black pudding", which I assume is an acquired taste.The restaurant is part of a boutique hotel (Trenchant Arms), where I might stay on my next trip to SG
4
After spending a couple of weeks in Singapore for work I was craving some more western style food. Rabbit Carrot Gun served up a mean Beef Wellington, cooked to perfection (medium rare) with a couple of pints of Tiger to wash it down it was perfect. Not the cheapest (about $35 for the meal), but hey that's Singapore. There was also an $11 service charge on the bill, not sure what that was about, but we left happy and full
5
The best food the best service And the best atmosphere on East Coast road!I call the owner Richard "King Richard@ because he is the "King of cuisine" in the Katong county! Try it out after your tired of high priced tourist places Or better yet Just come home and a truly relaxed and satisfying dining experience
4
Have been here a few times over the last year. For dinner a nice menu, steak was good value and vegetables fresh. The tuna nicoise was a bit of a let down in terms of quality of tuna - but overall a solid experience. We'll be back again.
2
Whilst the waitress wasn't openly rude she made you feel very uncomfortable...we will not go back.
The waiter saved the day from a complaint!
5
Four courses of absolute delight, three of which contained haggis. If you want fusion cooking look no further.
3
The ambience is unique here. Service is attentive. Food is acceptable but not real wow factor. Can come if you are around here.
4
The restaurant has nice, funky decor, very cool music. The menu is a bit overpriced and the portions could be a bit better. However the food is super tasty and full of flavours
2
The burger at $16 was bad value for money - very small. The fish & chips: the fish was tasteless and the batter so thick that there was more batter than fish; chips were fine. Service by blonde waitress strange; very sour faced. So many great, tasty value for money eateries in this area I would not go back to Rabbit Carrot Gun
5
Really enjoyed our late breakfast which ended up turning into more of a lunch. They were really nice about changing the bread on our meals as we have gluten sensitivity and sourdough is something we can easily eat vs others. Food came out quick was really well cooked. Not used to Singapore prices yet as everything just seems more expensive so can't comment on that.
4
This cosy little gem hidden in the eastern side of Singapore is great for beers and one of the few places in town for beef wellington. Their food is well portioned, reasonably priced and service was great. All decked up for Christmas, it was the perfect place to enjoy dinner at a table by the window, as you watch the world go by on a rainy night
3
We stumbled upon this place Friday night, and it was a pretty good find. On the corner at East Coast Road when you walk in it almost feels like you're in an old-time country living room. We were the only people in the place and the owner came up with a big friendly smile and handshake and introduced himself, kind of nice. We ordered the raw beet salad, fish and chips, soup, and crab cakes. None of it was absolutely spectacular but all of it was good. The raw beet salad was unique and tasty (even though it did not look very appetising) and portion was ample. The waiter told us that the pea soup is usually served cold, and offered to warm it for us which they did. It was tasty, albeit a little bit too watery for my liking. I like pea soup very thickThe crabcakes were probably the best thing that we ordered and were filling and a good size portion. The fish and chips was okay, the beer batter was still a little bit too oily, they probably should have drained a little more but the chips were delicious We were reading the menu and the breakfast there looks like it could be incredibly awesome. We will have to go back to try the breakfast and write another review
4
Trust the Brits to re-colonise its former colony with pubs. This pub however boasts a peaceful location with decently priced British classics (fish and chips, shepherds pie, bangers and mash, beef Wellington etc.). The food was quite tasty. Drinks were on the slightly pricey side but that's to be expected in Singapore. Stocked some great beers including one of my go to IPAs, Old Speckled Hen.Only complaint was the waitress who initially served us (European, blond) was quite rude when we arrived when there was a mix up with where we and our other guests were sitting. Other staff were pleasant.Would recommend for Poms
5
Delicious food, excellent service and a delightful ambience combine to make Rabbit Carrot Gun a place to remember and revisit. It was highly recommended to us and I can see why it has such a good reputation. Also remarkable value for the quality of the food
5
Lovely food lovely service with a new menu. Can't fault it 💪💪💪🏋🏻🏋🏻🏋🏻 plenty of choice on the menu with a new consultative chef all the way from Australia on board.
5
I found this cosy restaurant very interesting..A place to relax and enjoy the food. A good selection of dishes to chose from and certainly they were very tasty. Service was very efficient too.
5
We'd heard of this place, so decided to visit to see what the noise was about, and we were surprised at how nice it is! We were greeted by I assume the expat owner, he seated us and showed us photos of the specials on his phone, and we were totally in on the pancakes which looked great, and an interestingly named full English breakfast (gamekeeper's shooting breakfast), along with a couple of freshly squeezed orange juices. The food arrived in 25 minutes and was excellent, the breakfast had dry fried bacon (arguably the best method of making bacon) and decently done eggs to go with all the other components including the wholemeal toast. It was a big portion, I was struggling near the end which means it was a worthy size. The pancake was a recipe I'm sure a muse whispered into the chef's ear one night (oreo, salted caramel, vanilla chantilly, almonds and mint) because it is insanely good, the mint leaves surprisingly working well with the vanilla chantilly and salted caramel. Tldr, a great breakfast served within half an hour, all the staff were pleasant and friendly, and we enjoyed it enough to reserve a table for their roast tomorrow
5
Simply the best Sunday roast you will find in Singapore. I had the roast pork with crackling it came with cauliflower cheese, broccoli, carrots, roast potatoes with a Yorkshire pudding. The food was totally delicious. My partner had the roast chicken and he agreed his was delicious too. This will keep me going all day! The setting of Rabbit carrot gun is great too. In an old converted shop house, with seating all around outside a stones throw for Katong I12. Plenty of parking is available just across the road at the Indigo / Holiday Inn hotel. Tip: arrive early or order in advance as the roasts sell out fast
5
Needed to chill for a couple of hours after a busy few days of shopping and catching up with friends. I found Rabbit Carrot Gun, a great real cafe not far from Katong 112 with Melbourne quality coffee (we are very fussy with our coffee in Melbourne!) and a relaxing atmostphere. Friendly, efficient staff. Food was brilliant - I recommend the beef or lamb burgers (I'm on a diet so did them bun-less YUMMM) . A real 'watch the world walk by' over a coffee or glass of wine type place!
2
After a busy morning of sightseeing etc we dropped into the Trenchard Arms Pub next door to RCG and inquired if the Sunday Roast was still available. On being informed that it was, we sat outside. The server who came to take our order (who looked high on something) then asked if we had pre-ordered the roast!! No communication among staff, obviously. We informed him that we were told its available. My husband had the roast pork, I had the Cornish pasty with mash. the roast was typically British, and I mean typically bad British.. over-cooked soggy veg, tasteless meat and marmite flavoured gravy.. The pastry of the pasty was soggy and stodgy, and definitely not short crust, and it was difficult to discern what the meat in the filling was

Staying 2 nights in Singapore as a stopover between Australia & Europe. On both nights we've had lovely Asian food so we were looking for something different for a light lunch. In previous years we haven't been so impressed with what Singapore has to offer with European food (sometimes factory produced lunch items) but not this time...my quiche was perfect! I complimented the owner and she said that everything, including the pastry, is homemade. It was as good, if not better than many places we've eaten at in France. My husband also enjoyed his baguette and freshly made juice; I just had a soda water. $40 so you are paying a bit more for quality but worth it - good to support a small business too. They do serve alcohol including wine (we didn't look at prices) but we might return for dinner on our return journey home although I think we'll be hanging out for good Asian food again by then. Perhaps they do have some on the dinner menu...we'll check it out when we return for lunch next time

Popped in here to the Rabbit Carrot Gun (Great Name) a couple of times for Lunch, Have to say the service and food were great, run by a guy Called Richard (I think) who was very friendly guy.Menu is not huge, but the food they serve is both very well prepared and very tastey, all in all very pleased with the service and price here and would not hesitate to return
4
In our 6 months in Singapore we have eaten at the Rabbit carrot gun and the next door Trenchard arms over a dozen times. In that time we have never had a less than excellent pint (Sheppeys cider is my favourite), the food has always been well prepared (and served by some lovely waiters/waitresses) and the meat has been of the highest order. My wife, who is a fussy craitur, wasn't happy with the pepper in the sausages once but Richard (the owner) dealt with that to our satisfaction. Many a happy munch has been had on these premises.Do your tastebuds a favour and have the roast pork or the carbonara for that extra special treat

Went for brunch with Wife and eldest Daughter on a Sunday. Attentive service with the owner Richard keeping it moving. Daughter had the pancakes which she enjoyed with crumpets on the side which she said were really good. My Wife enjoyed her salad Nicoise. I has the omelette with sugar cured prawns and sambal- tasty and light. 2 Pavlovas and rhubarb crumble went down a treat. Owns the bar next door which does a good lemon lime and bitters. Apparently his Bloody Mary is very good but I can't get past tomato juice
4
Great eggs Benedict and an even better coffee, well done. Have been tO the bar next door too which I think is the same place. Good selection of gin I must say.
5
Fantastic food, great beer, friendly staff and excellent service - what more could you want from a pub!
Possibly the best burger in Singapore!

Tried this place on a sunday brunch, ordered eggs benedict n their caesar salad, with a chocolate banana smoothie. Food portion was quite miserable for the price charged, ended up leaving with a half filled stomach. Quality of food wasnt fantastic. Ordered the eggs benefict which was supposed to be on english muffjns but came on toast instead, server did not inform of change beforehand, else wont have ordered that. Hollandaise was tasteless, so was the smoothie, too much ice in it with very little chocolate n banana. The restaurant had pride in their deco, n even down to details like printing their logo on the napkin, but sadly there wasnt alot of pride in their food. Prob wont go back agai
4
This is a cute place on a busy street that still feels small and charming. Vibe is very French, especially inside. Food is tasty. I would eat here again
5
Stopped by for a coffee and a bite to eat and ended up having a great full English Breakfast, plus a free cocktail when we told the owner, "Huggy" we were on our honeymoon. The breakfast was very good - best sausages I had in Singapore.It does seem to be busy, so at peak times you may have to wait for a table unless you have booked
4
Being around the corner from our home, we regularly came to eat here and were never disappointed if we wanted a fix of British-style pub grub! It's great for breakfast, lunch or dinner. There's not much seating inside but there are quite a few tables outside. It's probably best to book if going at a busy time. A nice choice amongst the East Coast eateries.
4
Had lunch with a friend on a quiet Monday. The staff were friendly and the owner himself came over to help when the waitress was serving another customer. The menu is basic pub fare. The portions are generous and my friend struggled to complete his huge "best of British" platter with Scotch egg, bacon butty and sausage roll. I had the ploughman's which was fine. The flat whites were tasty, the decor and ambiance pleasant and the prices not too high. I'd go bac

Just wanted a light lunch - stopped by and ordered a burger and fries. Cooked medium well to perfection. Fans and air conditioning to keep you cool. Eclectic art on the walls add to the pleasant splendour of this former shop house.Outdoor seating available. Watch the world go by. Wifi available.Good food, good value - will visit again
5
No bling here - just good beers and simple, wholesome food from a friendly bar owner and staff. The sort of place where you can do: business/romance or chilling out. Family owned and run and well worth dropping into - 20 minutes drive from the airport
4
Now Singapore is one of the more pricey countries for restaurants so I'm sure this probably ranged at around average price, even though I would normally never spend Â£30 for brunch! The decor is magnifique to say the least! Beautiful food- granola, cherries, poached eggs etcetc. They have WiFi and also have good coffee. It was a great experience, but if you're looking for cheap eats, probably stick to the Hawker food
4
Good healthy breakfast. Loved the eggs benedict. Cooked perfectly. Recommend to add the sides or the meal is quite small. Good coffee too!
5
Fantastic birthday (for me) evening organised by my wife for our Singaporean friends. Lord Trenchard (the owner) did a wonderful job with the food. None of that foreign rubbish - Melton Mowbray pork pies, scotch eggs, fish and chips, Welsh rarebit, cheese cheese cheese!
4
Food served were great. Had different options of beer and some were not available when visited which was rather disappointing.
5
Ate there many times in Jan and Feb. Food is excellent (particularly the meat) and the staff were superb. Recommended heartily.
1
The food is really poor quality, we took a piece of meat and shepherd pie. The whole was super deceptive.
5
During my first visit in Singapore, I found this well rated restaurant on TripAdvisor and due to the short distance of my hotel, I had to try it. Why? Because there was a picture of an steak pie within TripAdvisor which I could not eat since 2009. It is very difficult to find a good ot available steak pie anywhere in Germany. So, I've chosen a table inside and the Chief (sorry, I forgot your name) had welcome me personally and instruct me about the daily offers and specialities. I took a Spitfire beer as well the Beef Wellington Steak Pie which was not a bad decision. It was medium and with a good red color on the inner side and came together with mashed potatoes and some vegetables. I can propose this menue to everyone who come here to this local at the East Road - corner- Ceylon Road. As sweet stuff after I've choosen a house made Cointreau Treacle Tart with cream which was as well a very very delicate pastry. Summarised you can have a very memorable diner in Singapore with a typical British taste beside the massive mix of several cultures and their special food.

(only my second ever review ) Having both, myself and husband, been working away a lot we were very excited to be spending Saturday with the kids and treat ourselves to a nice lunch. This place looked perfect! The menu looked great and we were especially excited about the desserts. When we were placing our order, I firstly apologized for being fussy. I wanted the Eggs Florentine but I cant eat bread so requested would it be possible to change bread to spinach (as is on other egg dishes) . He informed me 'No', we cant made a change to the menu or we would be here all day'. He suggested I buy a side order of spinach and leave the bread! I have requested this in every restaurant in Singapore (and worldwide) and not once has it been a problem. I didn't want special treatment just a little understanding. But what upset me most was his ignorant tone and willingness to waste the bread as they served it (on the side) and it was not eaten. (I also wanted the sauce on the side but then was so shocked to ask) Its such a pity that his ignorance will stop us returning. The kids loved their food. (however I did ask for only cheese on my child's sliders but got the full works and had to scrape it off) Needless to say we didn't stop for dessert. Shame
4
Decent food, had the rib eye, was well seasoned, potato gratin was a bit dry. Wife had Cornish pasty, wasn't bad but not technically a pasty, fries were very good though. Beer selection could be a bit wider, but staff were very good. overall not bad
2
Every week I will get a drink at trenchard arms while waiting for my kid's class. Drinks are ex but its great to feel like back in UK. Ate breakfast at Rabbit carrot gun before, simple fare but the ingredients are fresh, tasty and healthy. Always see the 'owner' (I assume is owner) at the restaurant and often compliment him to my friends for his discipline and hands-on approach. I think he must have great attention to details with the carefully designed decor and the place in any corner is always super clean condition. had recommended the place in my fb and to my friends.However, today's service left me in shock that this is the first time I ever written a review online. I asked for a table for 3 (a friend is walking over), ordered 2 drinks and a dish. The owner came to ask if our friend coming as he has other customers waiting for table. I told him 'walking over' and proceed to make a call to check. But he already start to pull away the adjoining table and commented to move us to another table. I was taken aback. I confirmed 'about to reach as he was just stuck at the ATM'. Anyway, the guy say he seated the customers elsewhere and sarcastically added that my friend was stuck for half an hour?? Come on, check our order slip, we only sat down for 15mins and we ordered food. Look around you, another couple just having drinks and their young boy also hoggin a table playing phone. This is the first time, I felt perhaps could it be cause I am local? The place does basically patron by expats and tourists only. Once my friend came, we just finish up and left quickly. No point 'hogging' the precious table. It was such a pity. What a shame..Enjoyed the quality of food although its expensive and had high regards for such a hands-on owner. Thought of even trying the boutique hotel. Never again will I come to this place..and definitely will not recommend. Many other places to go along that stretch. Perhaps I am jumping to conclusion and misinterpreted his intention. Still, this customer's moment of truth is a total letdown
5
I'm a bit late with my review but RCG is still the highlight of my Singapore trip. Such a fun night. Lovely relaxed atmosphere, amazing food (don't miss the scotch eggs & delicious cheeses), fine wines and spirits. Can't recommend this place highly enough and Lord Trenchard was a hoot. We'll be back just as soon as we can
5
Excellent Beef Wellington - would have given Chef Gordon Ramsey a run for his Beef Wellington.
Prompt & couteous wait staff & owner.
Die die must try
5
We travel a lot and always look for coffee destinations that can replicate a good flat white or latte like Australia and New Zealand and this is it... they also do a New Zealand ice cream called kapiti well worth a visit.
4
A good pub on a busy road in Katong. The service is good, the food excellent although the menu is a little limited. Just like a British pub but you can sit outside. If you're not staying in the area it is a bit of a distance from downtown Singapore but why not give it a try
2
We ordered two sets of poached eggs with toast and marmite. I've been here many times ( because it's 30sec from my home) and each time I order this, the marmite never shows up on the first try. You would think the marmite is a significant part of the dish considering its "two poached eggs on toast with marmite" I ordered the long black and it was burnt. Finally, if you order extra toast, be warned - their two slices actually means 1 slice cut in half - cheeky :
5
A group of us went to "The Gun" for New Years Eve in Sinapore. While we were miles away from the CBD and the fireworks we had a blast. Richard and Tricia created an evening of laughs and memories. The food was excellent with real home made scotch eggs and sausage rolls and the beef Wellington was one of the best that I have ever tasted. A great place in East Coast Roa
5
Ended up meeting a friend here tonight by chance (actually at Trenchard Arms which is next door but actually the same place). Beers were great. Food was amazing. The homemade sausages are best I have tasted in my 2 years in Singapore. But the homemade Christmas vodka was simply mind blowing. First time I have felt truly Christmassy here. I think this place is my new local. Only two bus stops away. And made to feel so welcome on this first visit. Cannot wait to try the Sunday roast. And should say, service was above and beyond. What a great evening. And it is only Tuesday! 6 stars really, but don't have that option.
5
We normally head here for breakfast/lunch and have a really great experience. The food and coffee is excellent for brunch.We booked in for the Sunday lunch (It is a set time system which was different concept but made for excellent food) and we both chose the beef. We must say it was the best Sunday Roast that we have had in any restaurant in Singapore. Food was served quickly and hot (see above time booking comment) and tasted amazing.Service was great as usual and we are looking forward to coming back soon!I would highly recommend the Rabbit Carrot Gun to all
5
The food here was certainly delicious and the staff very friendly and welcoming. We ate there almost every day during our visit to Singapore. Loved it so much we ended up eating there for our anniversary dinner where we were given a drink each on the house. <3 Now that I am back home I certainly do miss this place, I would just love to have breakfast there again, as well as the delicious cheese plate. This place is definitely one I'll never forget
1
Rude service staff. The restaurant was only 1/3 (or less) full but yet my food took ages to arrive. By the time it did, my tea had already turned cold. Staff did not apologize when it was obviously taking too long for the food to be served. I initially asked for sourdough bread to be changed and served with regular wholemeal bread. One waiter asked what type of bread I want replaced : multigrain or brioche. I chose the latter. After some time, the waitress (often with a stern look) said I can't change the bread at all as the kitchen do not have any other types of bread. So, I was thinking: a restaurant serving brunch menu do not have other types of bread to offer? Or was it sold out by midday? Anyway, I stuck to sourdough (I didn't have any choice). And, the wait.....Also, food was too pricey. 2 tiny slices of sourdough & scrambled eggs at $11....and for that kind of service, It is definitely not worth a second visit. No, not worth a third visit. The first time I patronized RCG was last december. I clearly remembered it was still good. I wondered what happened...All in all, NOT.going.back.there.ever.again.Cashier who got my bill probably had a bad day too. No "thank you" no "smile". No more Rabbit carrot gun
5
After staying across the road we finally found the best place to eat for breakfast lunch and dinner. The only place that made decent coffee, all meals priced good and a nice selection of foods. The waiter we had in the morning was friendly and happy. We wished he was there again when we had dinner because that waiter was the total opposite.Even better we could buy their awesome work shirts to
5
Food is always fantastic whether it's brunch, lunch or dinner!! Best fry up in Singapore without a doubt and TOP destination on East Coast
5
we had a wonderfull and tasty NZ beef!
one of the best ever eaten in spore.
very good restaurant, excellent cuisine in a charming place.
5
I visited along with about 10 girlfriends & we all agree that brunch was great but the selection of alcoholic mixes waa definitely my fav. Can't wait to visit for Sunday Roast!
4
Delicious food from home, wonderful ambiance, great service, we love it here. great selection of British food and cool decor. Consistently good experience. Been here 4 times, will definitely be going back.
1
I was for a while a regular here as the food despite being expensive was not too bad but as many other reviews will attest it seems the owners has a good-manners bypass and over time all my friends were insulted or had rude service so those bad reviews really do reflect the truth. Blunt and uncouth service is there aplenty, there are so many better places in Singapore than here
3
It was all a bit mixed, the pancakes were great however the Beetroot and rocket salad was disappointing. The coffees came out quite quickly but the children's drinks never arrived and had to be reordered. We got four meals pretty much together, it is a shame there were five of us. The setting is nice and it could be great but on his day it just wasn't
4
This is a great little cafe in the Katong district with very decent coffee and good breakfasts. I opted for poached eggs on toast with a cappuccino. The breakfast was a little on the small side, but was fine given I wasn't particularly hungry. The coffee was very good. Worth a visit if you're in the area
4
We found the Trenchard Arms by accident as we wanted an alternative to the hotel food. Normally we would not do the archetypal 'English breakfast abroad', but the dishes looked good with eggs Benedict etc on the menu.Service was attentive with Richard the host/owner engaging with all the diners. The food was very tasty, well prepared and obviously fresh. Coffee was excellent. The added bonus was that we were invited to watch the rugby (NZ vs. Argentina) as 'Private guests' after the bar closed at 10.30pm which added a nice finish to the Singapore Grand Prix.Things to watch...the malt whiskey is very expensive. My fault, I should have asked
5
We eat here often. We are always greeted with smiles and excellent service. The variety of food is delicious and the coffee - a delight. Love the atmosphere and am happy with anything on the menu. This is our main 'go to' breakfast spot in all of Singapore
5
I'm visiting friends from London and staying nearby. I've come here everyday from brunch and keep coming back.The owners the staff have been very friendly and the service is excellent. The food is perfect and reminds me of some of the best places for brunch in London.This is great area in Singapore, so if you get a chance check it out. There's also an adjoining bar that has great beers, so I've been stopping off here in the evening on the way home.Gar
5
We went here for Saturday morning brunch and it was fabulous. The service is quick and courteous and the food was absolutely delicious. Will definitely be coming here again.
5
Love this place! Awesome food, friendly & attentive service, AMAZING coffee (would go as far as saying it's the best in Singapore) & lovely atmosphere. What more could you want really? We'll be back for sure.
2
Nicely decorated place, good food and juice without being exceptional but way overpriced !
Small plate of 2 eggs and toast 12 dollars
Tiny and basically presented Benedicts for 15 dollars
Good intention here but clearly overrated
Some change need to happen
5
Oozing with class, this British inspired cafe/bar is rapidly becoming our local breakfast haunt. Our 2nd time back, my 1st meal was signature breakfast dish "the game keepers" breakfast, enough to feed an army and good price for the king size feast. 2nd visit and my meal was the other signature dish of sugar cured prawn omelette with sweet sambal. On both occasions we have been welcomed like family and have been looked after by both owner and the friendly staff. My wife and I have just concurred that it's comfortably the best coffee in SG. Haven't had the luxury of a lunch or dinner experience, however have just been invited to Sunday Roast!!! So watch this space.
1
Beef wellington tasted sour, smell foul and couldn't keep in my mouth for 2 seconds. feedback to staff and she advised that the shitake mushroom might have been bitter today. I am pretty sure I still can differentiate bitter and sour, and that dish is definitely sour and foul. She did not take my feedback and insisted there is nothing wrong with the food. Soon after she clear my table and tell me I am welcome to stay or leave. don't have to pay. worse service plus worse dish = worse restaurant
3
I go here once or twice a month as I live nearby but it's not without problems. It's a lot more expensive than most of their local competitors (eg. Melba, Oh Deli, Group Therapy) or place in the city centre. Sparkling water close to $8, virgin mary more than $12, steak sandwich more than $30, beers more than $15 and the list goes on. Plates are also more "empty" compared to the competion with for example an eggs benefict on a white plate without for example a mixed salad or other side dishes. It's their choice but they lose it here against other restaurants. On busy days service can be spotty as well with drinks not getting delivered etc. As it's a convenient place to meet with Katong based friends I'll continue to go back but not as often as I used to
5
If you are looking for a place that offers a great atmosphere, a friendly face and a consistently good menu with some interesting twists for breakfast lunch or dinner you shouldn't go past this place.Breakfast offers much from great yogurt and fruit through to some enticing variations on the traditional ....to my favorite ....the avocado, Bacon and Stilton breakfast sandwich...all served with one of the best cups of coffee in Singapore.Beef Cheeks on a bed of mashed potatoes or the Pork Belly are both great in the evening and there are always some interesting wines to try in accompaniment.Always accommodating (yes they do have accommodation of the highest quality upstairs) Tricia and Richard and their amazing team will make you oh so welcome.a must to tr

As Londoners living in Singapore we used to miss having a neighbourhood gastropub. The kind of place that serves brunch, lunch and supper. Healthy when you want it, and a burger with cheese and bacon when you don't. A place with a selection of wine sourced from small vineyards from around the world.Then we moved to Joo Chiat and found Rabbit Carrot Gun. A place that does all of that, but with a smile. Thoroughly recommended
3
I have been here twice for supper and my opinion has not changed. This restaurant is more like an unimpressive little cafe with a view of an old laksa hawker stall across the street. The beef wellington and puddings were good, but my rib-eye steak was extremely ho-hum, looked and tasted as though it had been tenderised with a hammer. I did not complain because I was with some young expat lawyers who frequent this place a lot. Rabbit Carrot Gun does appeal to those who are prone to gushing,... "OMG, a real hawker stall across the road, so rustic, so ethnic, babes"! (and willing to pay top dollar for the pleasure). This is definitely an "ang-mo" hangout. Method to their madness
5
Tried the meatballs and my friends ordered the beef cheeks and steak. I live in the east coast and we happen to stumble in the restaurant as we're looking for a place to eat on a friday night. Good thing we did as the foods are really good. The meatballs are perfect and the sauce is tangy just the way I like it. My friends rave about how soft the beef cheeks are and the steak is relatively cheap compared to other french restaurants. For dessert we went for the sticky toffee with ice cream. Best thing ever! The staffs are great as well as the owner. Chit chat with her for a little bit. What a good way to end the work week
5
The pork belly is absolutely delicious. I have visited here in many occasions and just love it. I can also recommend the beef Wellington.
5
Richard at the Rabbit Carrot Gun is a down-to-earth delight. Behind the bar, he eptimoses the tradtional "bartender", sharing jokes, stories and informal, fun conversation. And he cares, truly cares, about the quality of food and beverage being served to his customers. This is not the place for you if you want aloof, silver service; if genuine service and laid-back relaxation is what you want, then this is the place. Amazing, bespoke cocktails and the best Irish Coffee in Singapore
2
Surly or brusque, which word better describes the servers? Food was simple but expensive (SGD11 for two eggs and a piece of toast). But the waitstaff were almost mean. It seemed inconvenient that we were there. At the end the waiter literally snatched the credit card receipt from my hands. We were not demanding or difficult. Owners of Rabbit Gun Carrot, if you read this, please work with your staff to be nicer to customers. I would say eat elsewhere if you are looking for a restaurant in this area
4
This is an excellent place for breakfast though they do lunch and dinner as well. The latter two we can't comment but the full-on breakfast we had here recently was amazing. It does come at a price though: it's definitely a special occasions kind of thing. The location is brilliant as well, corner East Coast Road and Ceylon Road with a view to the famous Katong Laksa place which unfortunately no longer has the 'scenic' outdoor sitting area it once had.
5
On my last night in Singapore after 3 years living and working there, where should I go for my last beer. Here of course!Both the restaurant and the adjoining Trenchard Arms pub have been firm favourites of mine over the years. The craft beers are well kept, served and priced, the food ranges from simple British bar food to some more exciting restaurant offerings, and the staff and atmosphere are very welcoming.Keep it up Richard, I hope to be back to see you again
1
Ordered the tuna nicoise salad for $17 and what came was literally a few 'croutons' of seared tuna which was tasteless and then the salad consisted of chopped peppers and half an egg. Different from what expected and indicated on the menu. Dressing very basic and really the whole dish was terrible. I looked at a few other peoples food and also very very very very small. The menu looks brilliant and the setting is quite nice but they really need to work on this menu and issue. MAKE YOUR MENU REFLECT WHAT ARRIVES. I left and went to Orchard and got a Cesar salad for $12 which was 3 times the size and 10 times more tasty
3
This is a great concept - English/Australian gastro pub food, think sausages and mash or steak and chips, but sadly falls down on the portion sizes and the quality of food, which is a pity as the service was excellent.The steaks in particular were rather small, and the peppercorn sauce a little too astringent. We didn't stay for pudding but may try it again when we have English friends over
5
I booked a table for 14-16 pax on for Friday night. As is one of their busiest nights Tricia (director of private dining, events & etc) asked me to keep them updated if any changes in the number of booking, so we don't end up having empty seats. So i did. All the people turn up and we filled the two nice tables all in. The service was great. The waiter opened separate number/name bill for every couple so we can add items we purchase accordingly. Food was delicious. All arrived on time. The atmosphere is very customer friendly. Richard (the owner) always check on things to see everyone is happy and got what they've ordered. We all had great time! And we keep going for a beer or two:-)Thank you guys for your wonderful costumer service!

I didn't expect I will vomit after two glasses of wine in the restaurant. I can drink a bottle normally. So I vomited in the toilet and unfortunately in the basin as I was sitting on the toilet bowl when started to vomit. I was truly very sorry and the moment I stepped out of the toilet, I informed the staffs immediately and did my apology. The staffs were nice and said they will clean up. I felt much better after throwing out so I went back to the table, drank water and continued to chat to my friends. About 30 mins later, the owner came to the table with a completely black face. He dragged my friend (male) out and talked to him for about 5 mins. I didn't know what he was saying but he was very angry. 5 mins later after their conversation, he came to the table again and asked which one vomited. I identified myself, he said he can't believe I was sitting there doing nothing in a extremely rude way. Using the example of I go to his house and vomit. And he couldn't believe I looked perfectly ok and still there - his exact word
5
I was a fan of this place since it opened. Used to travel all the way from the West for the amazing food. I LOVE IT! Not only is the food super yummy, but it has a great vibe to sit and chat with friends. Now that I've moved to the East, I go for brunch with my family and dinner with friends. It's also a really chilled out place to have a pint or two at the authentic English pub next door. Oh, and did I mention the super-friendly staff? If you're into quality food and a good dining experience, this is the place for you
4
The coffee is very nice and so is the breakfast. Friendly staff.
Free wifi.
Worth travelling to the east coast.
5
Food was amazing and the owner was very helpful and talkative providing information of what to do and where to go in Singapore.
3
Granted the 'carte du jour' is far reaching and contrastive in it's entirety. That being said the selection of entrees we ordered were apathetic, lacklustre overall...
5
Between our group of 6 we managed to try 12 different dishes from the dinner menu, all were delicious. We'll be back
5
Great Service, good food (offering brunches, pork pies, scotch eggs) and the bar is excellent (with a good range of beers and attentive staff)
5
I live locally and this is one of my favourites. The location is great and you can choose from the great atmosphere in the pub (trenchard) or the more refined restaurant next door.The food is really good, interesting English offerings such as scotch eggs and pork pies are balanced with more elegant chicken in a box and fish and chips.The service is friendly and attentive. Have read a few negative reviews here on trip advisor but have seen these guys deal with their customers and they honestly are some of the hardest working and attentive people I have seen in Singapore
4
Big thanks to the team for keeping and returning my DSLR that was left at the outdoors seating area. I almost couldn't believe it when they said it was safely in their possession and that i could go down immediately to collect it, even if it was almost 12 midnight. Imagine losing all those precious pictures and, of course, the camera. That would have been disastrous for my business. Thanks, once again

Brought my family of 5 adults, 3 children for brunch. There was an empty long table in the restaurant but the manager/owner wanted to sit us outside at the corner in the sun. I declined and walked away cos I have a young 13 mo with me. As i walked away he then came over and offfered me another table at the corner this time in the shade.Fine by me and we settled in. I was given a really dirty high chair ( stained with wet dirt streaks on the chair) which i was wiping down while the others looked through the menu. The waitresses came by to take our orders. Mind you this was less than 2-3 mins. I looked up while cleaning the chair to request for a few mins. Lo and behold the manager / owner came over and started to lecture us that weekend mornings are by far their busiest and hope we order quickly and he will return for our order. OMG. What is this? we barely had 5 mins to settle down. we ordered and finished our brunch swiftly. We were there for less than 30 mins in total. And trust me i will not return. I dun mind paying more but not when my family and i were treated like that
1
Food OK, but the owner is rude and aggressive. Went with wife and child. He made us incredibly unwelcome from the start clearly because we weren't drinking wine. Stood over us and forced us to order as soon as we got there so he could get us out as quickly as possible.My main was ok but 3 prawns and 3 tortellini is small by even the best restaurants standards. When I mentioned this to the owner he initially was offended. He then went away and asked another customer what he thought about the portion size then came back to me and said the other customer thought it was fine and that clearly it was my problem not his! He was almost squaring up to me for a fight!I am very chilled and I've never had such terrible customer service. Avoid. Ruined my night. Since then we have met multiple people with similar experiences. He also tells people he is a "laird" in Scotland but actually bought the certificate off the internet for 20 dollars. In an area where there a many restaurants, this will not stay open long

We've eaten here twice and enjoyed both experiences - dinner and brunch. The food is well cooked and a nice change when you've been eating lots of Chinese/Indian meals. Not expensive and a reasonably priced wine list. Service pleasant and efficient. It's nice to sit on one of the terraces and watch life in Joo Chiat. After brunch we got a taxi to nearby East Coast park and had a good walk to burn off the calories

Enjoyed the meatballs and spaghetti, and a beer in the bar next door. The ploughmans sandwich is tasty and a good match for the Asahi.
5
Yummy coffee and the most delicious deserts. Must try the Pots and co "Salted Caramel and Chocolate cake"

Food is good! Coffee is awesome !! Staffs are friendly! We'll visit again :)

Very pleasant little restaurant located on the side walk. Pleasant service and good atmosphere in the bustle of Joo Chiat. Definitely e back to sample the food.

RABBIT CARROT GUN on Mountbatten RoadI never, ever write reviews, good or bad but I have just come back from Rabbit Carrot Gun across from i12 Katong and I'm kind of in shock. I'm going to offload here and then not allow it to ruin any more of our evening.My husband, son (5) and I went to said restaurant as recommended by friend. The minute we arrived the owner was annoyed (not obviously going to be a heavy drinking bunch) and literally as soon as we sat down he shoved menus at us and said; "okay I've got a table of 18 there so lets get you out of here before they get rowdy." and stood over us while we ordered our food and drinks all at once. He then became annoyed when I asked for a non-alcoholic beer and water for my son. We had to ask five times before my sons water came.The 'special' which my husband ordered arrived and was 3 tiny 'king' prawns and three tiny pieces of tortellini. Mike ate his in under a minute. When the chap asked how it was, Mike said "yeah it was lovely but pretty small for a main course don't you think?" To which the owner replied, "I don't know what to say about that. That's what you ordered. Other people think it's great as it is, so that's that." Exact quote, delivered with much attitude.We at this point are just gobsmacked, we hadn't be aggressive in the slightest, my husband just pointed out the obvious, that it was teeny meal that should not be a main. Still eating, somewhat subdued as we try to make 3 meals out of two, owner comes back and snipes, "It's all about perception really, other customers have told me they loved it. So that's what the problem is, it's just your perception." Again, open mouths.I get it, I really do, it's Friday evening you want big paying customers in, not families. I've just never seen customer service like this, in any country I've been to, we are both sitting here still sitting gobsmacked. It has ruined our night. All the chap had to do was apologize or empathize or offer a free side of veg? But he was unbelievably aggressive and made us feel unwelcome the moment we sat down, clearly we should have left then. We went there on recommendation and had heard good things but wow, did we get a shock. Just letting you ladies with families know, clearly you are not welcome at rabbit carrot gun. frown emoticon x

Ate brunch today. Ordered a tuna salad, egg plus toast, and mushroom spinach toast. Food quality is good and fresh. Staff is courteous and perhaps too enthusiastic to clear my plates! (only two tables with customers). When I asked the staff to recommend the desserts, they couldn't say much. So gave up the idea to order one. Price is based on bistro level. Go there if you want a BF or just a meal.

We visited RCG on Saturday evening with two friends for dinner. We are regulars and have spent a fortune over the past couple of years and some of the staff know us.We ordered our main course which we all enjoyed to varying degrees. The fish was nice but way over cooked and the pork I am told was ok. They forgot the sides, but they didnt charge us so no harm done.The current manager seemed friendly on arrival so when our desserts were delivered to the table in a way I have never experienced before I felt I had to ask him to come over.The waitress carried three desserts on a plate/tray and held the in her other hand. She then ran a full speed at our table and dropped them in front of us and then ran off. Maybe she had a train to catch and was in a hurry.All the desserts looked the same to us and we couldnt tell them apart. We waved her back to find out which was which but her explanation wasnt convincing.The manager, who had been enjoying socialising with the clientel all evening, was most displeased with us for some reason, but quickly sorted out pudding situation. Although we forgot about it very quickly, from time to time we heard him speaking about us to other customers in a loud voice. It seemed odd, but we ignored him.Later we went into the bar section for some drinks. I was served a glass of red wine which was off. I sent it back. Not long after the manager again came over and challenged me about the wine. He tasted it and said it was fine. I told him that I wasnt going to drink it. So he went away. About 10 mins later he came back with what he claimed was new wine for me to taste. There was only about 3mm in the glass so it was difficult to tell. I tried to be polite and said I would pass on the wine. About 15 minutes after that the manager came back and advised that he had shared my wine with a wine expert friend and discussed it with their group and the consensus was that the wine was indeed off and that perhaps I was a reasonable judge of wine after all. He apologised. We spent $360 that night and it will be the very last they see of us. My birthday party has been scheduled elsewhere now

We visited this place today for the first time after reading good reviews about it. We had the full signature breakfast each and were very happy with it. It was very good quality breakfast and I saw other foods going out of the kitchen to other tables which all looked very appetizing. The staff were courteous and it was easy and fast to get a table even with a pram.However I have given this place 4 stars instead of 5 because:1. The freshly squeezed orange juice was very watered down and tasteless for $7.50 per glass - tasted the same as the watered down juice you can get in cheap food courts so this was very disappointing and a waste of money.2. The latte and the cappuccino both tasted like they were straight out of a machine so it was nothing special and the latte was a lot stronger and bitter than the cappuccino when it should be the other way round.3. The breakfasts do not have the option of potatoes or hash browns which is a shame.4. We ordered a slice of cake but the service in bringing the cake was extremely slow that we ended up finishing our coffees before the cake arrived after asking for it again two more times. The cake did not need any preparation or heating - all they had to do was cut it and put it on a plate! The cake was definitely not worth the wait and definitely not worth $7.50 for a slice as it did not taste very good and was not fresh.5. Our bill was presented to us on the waiter's mobile phone screen which was very strange. It was very small to read and had to scroll up and down and hold the waiter's mobile phone in my hand to see! I found this a bit odd!6. It was extremely hot even though we sat inside. We were sweating and my baby was getting heat rash.Overall, we would have the breakfast again if we are in the area near this restaurant again but we would not order any of their juices or any of their cakes again

Lord Trenchard (Richard) runs a very good business. We stayed at the hotel, drank at the pub and ate breakfast, lunch and dinner - over the four day CNY holiday. Great vibe, great food and the best service in Singapore. We came with the family (My wife and four girls) and having lived in Singapore previously for 6 years, came back to visit old friends. We basically took over a table and entertained guests for our entire time here and it was superb. Eat, drink or sleep here. You won't be disappointed.
5
One of the best places in Singapore to get an excellent breakfast of high standard at very reasonable cost.Sit outside amid the hustle and bustle, take it slow and watch the world speec frenetically by!If you are visiting the Katong area this is the place to fortify yourself to kick off your visit
4
Food is good, service was good and extremely fast! Not too badly located on a nice corner. Easy to find free tables. I would recommend!
5
A gem of a place in Joo Chiat. Great food, fantastic service and a great atmosphere/decor. A must-try when you visit this area. My husband and I have made this our local :) Thank you!

Along the strip of restaurants between Katong Shopping Center and I12 Katong on East Coast Road, the hungry shopper and neighborhood community has a varied choice of options. But the ratio of good, high quality food serving restaurants does not match up to the quantity of offerings. Consistently over a course several lunches, RCG delivered good service and really tasty food. Quiches, salads and desserts for lunch were outstanding each time I dined. And it serves an all day breakfast menu until 430pm on a week day. Weekends, enjoy the brunch! While it's not a place that pops out on the strip, it consistently delivers. This saves me time, more than satisfies my hunger and I leave the restaurant happy...and willing to return

Was here on their very very busy and happening night @ V-day for dinner. The restaurant is fully booked. Luckily I had the reservation done beforehand. Had the V-day dinner set and I would say the foods are superb! Even though the restaurant was really packed and busy on this special night. The services provided by the waiters and waitresses had given their best service to make sure guests on this busy night was served probably. Thumb Up
5
My wife and I wanted something less traditional for a Valentine's dinner while on a stopover through Singapore. We chose RCG based on its high reviews here on TripAdvisor and its proximity to our hotel in Joo Chiat. From the moment we walked in, Richard, the owner, warmly welcomed us, sat us down, and walked us through the menu (despite it being one of the busiest evenings of the year!). We were expecting regular pub fare, as seen on their website, but instead for Valentine's there was a selection of exquisite main courses and appetizers (as well as a phenomenally assembled set menu). We chose the cheese board, rib eye steak, and salmon, all of which were divine. The cheese board came with water biscuits, mature cheddar, double brie and a phenomenal goat's feta cheese in brine, as well as apricots and walnuts. The steak came with a delicious Bearnaise and the salmon was cooked to melt-in-your-mouth perfection.The restaurant was packed (we had to reserve, but that was Valentine's day) and yet the servers were always ready to help and meet our needs.Everything went beyond our expectations and we would love to go back again (the breakfasts look fantastic)

Rabbit-Carrot-Gun serve excellent quality food at very competitive prices, and their British Pub (Trenchard Arms) next door is the best place in the east of Singspore, to relax and enjoy British Beers and Ciders. So whether your a visitor to Singapore, or a resident, this is the place to try
5
My girlfriend and I are regular to Rabbit Carrot Gun, their selection of eggs is great, cakes are lovely, staff is very friendly and accommodating. Best of all, price are really reasonable for this quality of food/service/ambiance. Just by sitting there you feel like being part of the cool people in the East.It's also a great atmosphere for a romantic dinner, must try: Rabbit carrot Gun's Signature Beef Wellington (for two)

My boyfriend and I have recently discovered the joochiat area to be bustling with life and hidden with gems waiting to be discovered, Rabbit Carrot Gun is definitely one of the few in the area. We were strolling down the shophouses attempting to find a hearty all-day breakfast (you know, nice milky eggs, warm toasts that melts your butter when you spread on em, and of course your bacon and mushrooms!). We decided to go with RCG and was pleasantly surprised and contented.Interior/Atmosphere: Situated in a shophouse, RCG has retained some local old-school coffeeshop flavour(mainly due to the shophouse) and mixes it with groovy elements by incorporating interesting art canvases. The playlist choice was spot on with my boyfriend and it really sets your weekend on the right note. Food:Visited RCG twice and both of us ordered the same thing, their all-day breakfast set. I've always complained to my boyfriend about the craze for bacon, like why do people enjoy dry, hard meat. RCG presented some moist and juicy bacon on my plate and yes, bacon should be done that way! As for the eggs, beans, sausage and toast, mmmmm mama-mia! Whats more, its priced really reasonably at $19.50/set. A complete meal ends with dessert, and I'm incredibly excited (and picky) about my desserts because I love them that much. Ordered their apple crumble and was getting a little impatient with the waiting time. As soon as that warm apple crumble served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream was on the table, I forgot all about waiting a little longer for it. Apples inside the crumble were not too sweet, and the smell of cinnamon was just soooo good. When you pair it with the vanilla ice cream, its the best. Something that really made me happy was the fact that you could bring home the pretty pastel-coloured ramekin which the apple crumble was served in!! Service/Etc: The boss whom I believe is called Richard really goes the extra mile to make his customers feel welcome! He served something very British to my boyfriend that is perhaps very difficult to find in Singapore- Black pudding! He really likes it!Conclusion? This may very well be our regular brunch place! And I'm determined to collect all the different coloured ramekins
5
My wife and I moved to Singapore 6 months ago and although we whole heartedly embrace the local food scene you cannot substitute a great English breakfast to get your weekend started. After a number of failed attempts in the east coast area we tried RCG and have never looked back. The beans are warm (yes, donâ€™t take this for granted - our first 3 cafes served cold beans with egg-mayo??), the eggs are great in any way you want them and the bacon is real back bacon, not streaky bacon! We live in the East so this is our regular weekend stop, and I would probably come to visit if I was based in the west as the East coast vibe is nice and chilled, a great place to relax and read the paper.The owner is very friendly British chap who has informed me there is a secret ingredient off menu if you ask for it nicely...think black..think pudding ;

Rabbit Carrot Gun is one of our favourite spots to head for brunch/lunch/dinner on the east coast. The food is excellent, the service is brilliant and the staff are genuinely nice people who make our visits so pleasant each and every visit. If you're looking for a great little spot, perfect for people watching or catching up with friends over some pretty fabulous coffee, Rabbit Carrot Gun is a winner..

A breath of fresh air in Singapores East Coast... great food reminding me of what my mum used to cook... served with a modern twist. Atmosphere is fabulous and relaxed and service prompt & friendly... I'll be back over & over again!!
5
This beautifully done restaurant is well set out well staffed and with the food of the gods I have been several times and on all my accessions I have been delighted by the quality all-round
Cheers guys,
Your the best

I just love this place. They serve great beer and fantastic food. It's a real local boozer with a real feel of the UK.
The bacon, Stilton and Avocado sandwich is to die for. Well done
5
This was the perfect breakfast. A really great Flat White and scrambled eggs, with the best bacon I have eaten in Asia! Set in the Katong area on East Coast Road this is a must, I can't wait to try dinner and will look at the rooms.The atmosphere is very relaxed and the dÃ©cor quirky and very in keeping with this lovely area of Singapore. The service is prompt and very polite. The Breakfast Menu is varied and all the food I saw looked delicious. Did I mention the flat white! it was as smooth as silk, just what the doctor ordered as I have a bad throat at the moment! I was lucky enough to catch the owner and compliment him directly on a great eatery.This will be my breakfast venue of choice for the next few days. I recommend anyone in the area to make a b-line for the fantastically named Rabbit Carrot Gun
5
Had the most amazing service. An awesome place if you like to have a nice cup of tea chill and chit chat. The owner was so accommodating, I had my infant with me which was a little hard but the staff made it so much easier for me. Great trendy li

I ate at Rabbit Carrot Gun last night and it was fantastic British food. Scotch eggs to die for, great sausage rolls like my mum makes, lovely fresh tasting pork pies, and the beef wellington was awesome. My wife ordered the shepherds pie and when I tasted some it was like a scene from the film Ratatouille whereby the critic is taken back to a childhood moment. If you want the best quality British comfort food then Rabbit Carrot Gun is the place to go

My sister and I ordered the Fish & Chips and the Mushroom & Spinach Toast(?) for brunch. It wasn't crowded since it was pre-lunch time at around 1130. I liked the Fish & Chips; the portion of fish was reasonable, well-cooked, well-seasoned(although "tasteless" w/o lemon juice or tartare sauce) and the chips were of a portion too big but of good thickness and appropriately seasoned with salt. Thumbs up for this dish!The toast on the other hand fared slightly worse in my opinion. I personally prefer "moistured" food so any dish on the dry side, I will naturally dislike more. This dish basically consists of 2 poached eggs(they were well poached), sourdough toast(soft and fluffy), sauteed mushrooms and spinach(well cooked). However, I would very much have preferred some hollandaise sauce with it. The yolks were not enough liquid for my liking. Hence, if someone who prefers dishes slightly on the fry side, do have a go.There were only the boss(I believe) and one waiter who served when we were there. Both were friendly, especially the boss himself, a beer-bellied Englishman(I believe, from his accent). He was kind, outgoing and very friendly.All in all a place worth a try but not if you're gonna take long to travel to get there
4
This whole area is kicking off and this bar/restaurant is a great place to start - great staff, wide range of beers and, best of all, more single malts than you poke a stick at - a very welcome change from Tiger and "whisky" you get elsewhere in Asia

Been to this place many times with friends. Beautiful restaurant with really nice food, and the staff are very friendly. I have tried almost everything here (except pork) but my fav is still the lamb burger. I have also recomended this place to some of my friends and they loved it too. Highly recomended!!

I am not a mean reviewer i swear to god. But lo and behold this place was so bad that compelled me to give my first Tripadvisor review to inform whoever that is reading this a heads up.The service is really bad. Most of the servers there are from the Philippines and i thought they provide good service. But i was so wrong. The place was not full but they took a hell long of a time to serve the dishes. And they span of time taken to serve was over 45mins!My friend's meal was served first and by the time the rest of us have our main course placed in front of us, my friend was already half digested and playing games on his mobile out of boredom.when we told the waiters there that the beef was well done while we asked for a medium rare, they insisted that it was medium rare.My main complaint was the time they took to serve the dishes where the place was only like 35% occupied.The food are also really pricey for this type of service. Not to mention there wasn't air conditioning and the servers walk over to you with obvious reluctance when you request for their help.i am never going there ever again even if the food is free of charge.Hope whoever are going there get better experience than i do

We went there with friends for a diner. It was a great experience. Food is really good, try the beef Wellington, it's a must try. Service is good and friendly and ambiance is relax.
4
I ate here 2 nights in a row (which I think says it all).
Both courses on both nights were very good. Quality ingredients handled well.
I would definitely return if in the area again.
Congrats to the owner / chef.

Nice decor and concept of a typical British pub / B&B. But way overpriced and service is very bad. Coffee was utterly disappointing too. The staff and management were quite arrogant too. In summary, good concept but lame execution and bad service with sub-standard products.

I visited on a weekend at a time when it was transitioning from the brunch menu to the regular lunch time menu. The service and kitchen staff were so nice enough to accommodate my request of ordering one item from the brunch menu and two others from the regular one as we ordered at 2:30 (the time the menu changes). My boyfriend ordered a steak sandwich, I had a lamb patty burger and we shared a home made chicken liver parfait/terrine. The chicken liver appetizer was fantastic, simply made perfectly and I would go back just to eat that! The steak sandwich was okay but the onions were more sauteed than caramelized. I had asked for my lamb patty to be medium however it arrived raw. I love my steaks medium rare and I don't ever mind bloody meat but I took a bite and cut the patty a bit and could see the mince lamb patty was 80% raw. I let a staff know that I had asked for medium and I found it too undercooked and he very nicely got it recooked for me. Other than this the side of fries that came with our mains were so amazingly out of this world.Overall, the food could have been amazing but I'd still recommend this place. They were very busy but the staff were very attentive. It's just that for what you get the prices are quite steep, otherwise it's a very quirky neat place to visit
4
A lovely and lively venue for a dinner with my boyfriend and some pretty traditional British fare was exactly what we wanted, and Rabbit Carrot Gun didn't disappoint. Bangers and mash + Eton mess were had, the steak was a wee bit small for my guy, but delish nonetheless. We'll be back
4
Ambience here was fantastic, I loved the brunch whether the omelets or the tasty eggs benedict. Great coffee/latte! Service pretty good and location is convenient. It's open air so if you want something with AC, choose elsewhere
4
My first experience during end of June 14 was bad, super poor attending to customer's request which a fast food restaurant have better ownership of customer service. Again given another chance in September 14 till now with a new team of great staffs, it makes a wonderful experience , A-Must thumb-up to patronise Rabbit, Carrot, Gun.

It pains me to write this review but I really feel I must.I love the concept of Rabbit Carrot Gun - a cosy English style eaterie with added quirk right in the middle of Katong. I really wanted to like this place but repeated disappointment have forced me to strongly not recommend this place.The first two times I came here were not great but not too bad either, but the last two visits have been so intolerable that I have sworn off ever re-visiting.I came on a weekend afternoon where the place was reasonably busy. Nobody greeted me so I found a seat by myself, grabbed a menu myself from the bar, and tried to place an order. With no exaggeration, I tried for 30 minutes to get the attention of a waiter but was continuously ignored, even when I stood up and asked them directly to take my order. In the end I just walked out and got my coffee and cake from elsewhere.The second time there was really no excuse. We had taken a day off during the week and arrived around 1.30pm on a very quiet weekday when there were only two other tables with people sat by them in the whole restaurant. Despite the lack of other customers, the service was even worse than before. I had to get my own menu, I had to walk to the bar and place my own order, I even had to pop my head in the kitchen and ask one of the chefs about one of the dishes when the waitress couldn't answer me. We wanted to drink cider: they couldn't tell me what cider they had and couldn't serve it to me as it was in the bar next door. After a lot of effort I finally got the manager to take my food and drink order.30 minutes later our food and drink still hadn't arrived. On that day there were two staff: a young girl wearing tooth braces who was actually pleasant enough, and her supervisor who I think was a middle aged Malay guy in glasses. To my horror I noticed that our drinks had been waiting on the bar all this time and the supervisor was just playing with his phone and not bringing them over. I asked him to bring over the drinks to our table to which he shouted:"Be patient."I told him not to scold me and that it was unacceptable that our drinks weren't being brought to us when by that stage we were the only customers left in the restaurant. His reaction was to call the young girl from the backroom and tell her to bring the drinks to us rather than do it himself. I was disgusted.Another 20 minutes later when the food arrived it was the wrong order. We just decided to eat it and leave rather than wait any longer. As we left, the supervisor was shouting at the young girl to clean some tables - again, not doing anything himself apart from play with his phone.My advice: Rabbit Carrot Gun has some serious problems when it comes to its service; problems that cannot be solved simply by cutting and pasting the same tired old response to every negative review posted on TripAdvisor (come on guys, at least use a different response, not the one beginning "What matters from mistakes is what we learn" all the time). The food is genuinely not bad there, so thankfully there is now a solution. Go to their sister restaurant Nibbles at China Square where they have some of the same snacks and avoid completely the bad attitude at the Katong branch. I'm also glad to see that the young waitress with the braces is now at the China Square restaurant and won't have to suffer under the lazy supervisor at RCG Katong

Lovely pub on the corner in Katong with traditional British pub food. Nice relaxed atmosphere and staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful without being in your face all the time. Food quality was excellent. Most of the wines we wanted were out of stock but after a weekend and being such a popular place it is not surprising. Highly recommende
5
My mother is a marvellous cook, no honestly. However I've sad news which I'm unable to break to her - she's redundant since I've chances upon Rabbit Carrot Gun.Finding good service is close to impossible in Singapore, so I was pleasantly surprised by the staff of this beautifully designed alfresco restaurant.My wife, children and I enjoyed dinner there last Sat and we can only praise the food. Of particular note was the Beef Wellington & Sausages & Mash were exceptional, although all the dishes were very good.Highly enjoyable and relaxed surroundings, great food. Simple really
5
We had a fantastic meal, in a lovely relaxed environment. The prawn cocktail starter had lots of big juicy prawns and the goats cheese salad contained chunky rounds of creamy goats cheese. The highlight by far was the beef wellington main course for two. The fillet steak was perfectly cooked, and plentiful, surrounded by delicious, buttery pastry. The service was friendly and attentive and the wine prices very reasonable for Singapore. We would definitely recommend this restaurant for well cooked, homely food

13th September 2014, a group of us went to Rabbit Carrot Gun with the intention to celebrate our friend's birthday. It was supposedly a brunch session and we wanted to surprise our friend with a birthday cake. (Previously, I had a rather pleasant time here in Rabbit Carrot Gun and hence decided to return here to celebrate a birthday.)Who knew, it turned out to be the worst place ever.Firstly, we had to ask 3 times to get our water. It's not like we are cheapskates and drinking free water. We ordered drinks but just wanted some water to quench our thirst. No initiative from them to refill either! I had to take the bottle to the counter and do it myself! I don't mind having to do it myself, but at least tell me that you do not want to serve me! Don't waste my time waiting!Secondly, the food ain't fantastic anyway. My friend's eggs benedict tasted weird.Last but not least, the unforgivable one, they did not tell us beforehand that no celebrations were allowed?! When a friend came to pass them a cake to keep first, the waitress/waiter who took it should inform us that we can't eat the cake here. Instead, they kept it in the fridge for us and when we called for it, they just pass us back the box of cake! O.M.G. Not only did the surprise got ruined, but who does that?! Which restaurant doesn't put the candles, light it up, and serve it? Also, no initiatives to give us plates and forks. When we asked them, they said that we can't eat it here. Then why didn't you tell us earlier? One thing to note: it is not as though they are very busy. The restaurant was rather empty on a Saturday 12pm. Oh wait, that's expected with a service so poor, I wish there was a ZERO star option. How can they even win a tripadvisor award. Are they the only one in the category?

As a family we have been in Singapore now for 3 years and although we have been to some great British restaurants none have really resonated with us.We have had a lot of our friends recommend the Gun but all said it was abit "lumpy" (expensive) so we have avoid it.However we decide to bite the bullet and we gave it a go and we was not disappointed. Food is quite stunning especially the starters and although the menu is not that extensive we found that it's defiantly quality of choice here not quanity.Give this a go if you really miss the UK, the quiche starter is amazing and the deserts well..... They are simply divine

This restaurant had some of the best coffee we tasted in Singapore. It is not easy getting decent coffee in these parts.However the coffee was not too milky and also very hot. Delicious. Had some sourdough toast with it and this was also good
2
Read the reviews about the poor service but thought I'd give it a shot anyway. I had the big breakfast which was not great. The yogurt/musli come as a ridiculously small portion and thus need to be accompanied with something else. Coffee is also over priced ($6). Normally I can deal with all of this though and I really wanted to love it as it's conveniently down the road. The service I can't deal with. The young guys running around are doing their best and can be forgiven. However the lady manager (or at least I think she was the manager) was incredibly rude and impolite right from the beginning. It's like she has never worked in a cafe before. Welcoming guests and thanking them when leaving would be a good start. Also placing the food on the table instead of throwing it would go a long way. Point being, I'm never going back and you (reader) shouldn't bother trying this place.

Love the friendly neighbourhood ambience! It's right on the corner of East Coast Rd and across from awfully chocolate.We started off the night at the pub right next door! We ordered their mini pork pie for starters (absolutely scrumptious and mouth watering). Then we move to the restaurant for dinner! I ordered their Pork, Rosemary & Apple Sausage Mash! I was surprised by the generous portion size and how juicy the handmade sausages were! It definitely reminded me of a traditional Sausage & Mash in England.My partner order their roasted chicken wrapped in bacon! Another favorite of ours. We are surprised how well put together everything was for a fraction of the cost of what we would normally pay for a fine dining entree. Completely blew my expectations! Highly recommend this place
5
I came here for a couple of drinks and it was so chilled and very relaxing. The manager who was on the bar that night was very friendly and was very keen to tell us the difference between certain beverages. We shared a sausage roll which was de-licious. Didn't matter that it took 20 minutes because I knew it was from fresh! Can't wait to go back there and enjoy a proper full meal
5
My boyfriend and I visited Rabbit Carrot Gun for a leisurely Sunday brunch last weekend and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. We'd heard some great things from friends and were keen to check it out for ourselves. The staff are friendly and accommodating - both of us asked for minor tweaks to our dishes (me: no hollandaise sauce and him: no mushrooms), which they were more than happy to do without the fuss you often get in restaurants in Singapore. I had the Eggs Benedict which was delicious; the eggs were poached perfectly. My boyfriend had the full English breakfast which he devoured and was particularly impressed by the pork, apple and sage sausage (he's very fussy about sausages in Singapore and claims this is one of the best he's had!). We also enjoyed delicious freshly squeezed juices. Overall, a lovely morning spent at Rabbit Carrot Gun - we even took home a couple of slices of quiche which we enjoyed later that afternoon. We'll definitely be returning

We came to RCG today for brunch. We didn't hâve to sait for à table à sit was not full which is great. However, the staff didn't sème to pay jucy attention to us. We has to waive the staff to order after waiting for a while. The service was very long even of the place wasn't crowded and had to ask twice to get water. Scrambled eggs were average And portion of spinaventosa and mushroom very little so was the sourdough bread. Sides are à bit overpriced: $4 for tomatoe

I went here with friends for the Thursday night pub quiz and was treated to the kind of service that would embarrass Basil Fawlty.  After arriving, I immediately ordered a beer, and a glass of water. The beer arrived, the water did't. After asking another three times for the water, the manager came over, aggressively placed his hand on my shoulder and said "I've seen you lot here before, you sit here all night drinking water, and I'm not serving you any water tonight". Which, apart from being incredibly rude, and borderline assault, was factually untrue - we had been there once before and had drunk plenty of beer.  So we packed up our pencils and left. Seriously, firstly, get your facts straight before you start accusing people of being moochers. We were just settling in for a long night and were pacing ourselves. Is there a minimum of one beer per round at your pub quiz? Do you need the entire table to be absolutely plastered before the winner is revealed?   It seems that having a good experience at Rabbit Carrot Gun is entirely contingent upon the owner, not being there. I choose to spend my money elsewhere

We went here on a weekday after dinner. This place is a great chill out place. Location is perfect. We only had drinks, wine was reasonably Singapore price. Service was decent.
4
We ventured over to Rabbit Carrot Gun from our nearby hotel for a break from their breakfast buffet and enjoyed a tasty brunch, including their yummy French toast with berries. We actually arrived a few minutes before the official opening time and the staff encouraged us to take a table and enjoy coffee until the cook was ready to start

Rabbit Carrot Gun is a real gem of a place situated in vibrant Tanjong Katong. The food and wine were excellent as were the rooms upstairs which we checked out for visitors coming in the future. The room are nicely furnished and we agreed that this is the perfect spot for friends coming through Singapore who want something other than the typical big hotel experience, but instead want quaint rooms in the heart of a vibrant local area.Our table tried the beef wellington (a must) the linguine and the pork. All the dishes were well executed and to finish a delicious cheese board.Overall a really pleasant dining experience which we will repeat in the future
5
We had the pleasure of not only dining at RCG, but also staying upstairs in the clean, smart rooms. A fantastic place. RCG was recommended to us by a friend who lives in Singapore and it surely did not disappoint. The Breakfast menu has great variety, with something for everyone. Importantly, nearly the best coffee we had on our trip. Dinners were top notch. I would highly recommend to anyone wishing to dine (and even stay) on the East Coas

Rabbit Carrot Gun is as different as the name suggests. That is unless you've experienced true local pubs in England. Many chains try to re-create this but few succeed. Rabbit Carrot Gun's proprietor (Richard a former Ruby Union Hooker) has that very hard to find natural ability to engage people with his enthusiasm. In addition to this the Beef Wellington is as good as I've eaten anywhere, great meat, very well cooked and pastry that takes me back to my childhood. Add to this some very good beers and it makes for a very enjoyable evening

This place is a great find next to Katong Laksa on Ceylon Street (near Roxy Square and Katong Mall). The service, food and wine are wonderful. I did not give this a 5 star as I thought the food was slightly overpriced for the not-so-big brunch portions. Yes, it is Singapore but the portions don't have to be super sized or ginormous! Anyhow, I had the mushrooms on a toasted english muffin with poached eggs my friend had the eggs florentine on two toasted english muffins. I had a lovely side order of big fat yummy fries as well. My friend and I came for a Sunday brunch - highly recommended to make a reservation - and it was a rainy Sunday. The service was a little slow but the servers were friendly. A caveat: do not sit outside when it is raining as the sewer overflows and your feet will definitely get wet
4
I visited the restaurant with my girlfriend for dinner, before moving over to the bar for drinks afterwards. We both had a great pumpkin soup each, followed by the Sea bass and Steak. The food was seasoned well, and really paired well with the wines. We had a couple of rounds of beer and wine in the great little bar next door, before retiring. I would definitely recommend this place to my friends, and will be back soon
3
Food is reasonably good. We had prawn cocktail, pumpkin soup,pan seared chicken breast and slow roasted pork belly. Pumpkin soup was excellent, prawn cocktail was nice - well made but way overpriced at sgd15 for 3 prawns. Chicken breast was pretty rubbery at some parts. Pork belly was good.
4
Been here a couple of times. The food is quite good. The atmosphere is good, whether for a drink and for a meal. I would have enjoyed this place more if it does not remind me of my favourite Katong laksa stall right at the same coffeeshop that was here for many years since I was little. I wondered what happened to the stall. Katong is changing...it is never the same again..

I had dined in this restaurant before but it was too quick a bite to make an impression. This time it was brunch and I had all the time in the world.The restaurant was quaint and had an old world charm. It was after all renovated from a pre-war shophouse. Black and white photos adorned its walls together with a huge painting of a redhead. Outdoor and indoor tables are available to suit your preference. Brunch comprised of super berries tea, french toast with berry compote, eggs pacifico (poached eggs and smoked salmon) and toast for 2. The tea turned out to be quite bitter if the teabag was left in the cup for too long, so leave the teabag out of the cup. The French toast was both sweet and sour, the right combination. I would also like to commend Angie for her exceptional service. She was proactive and interacted with the patrons as much as she could without compromising on her service standards. Rabbit Carrot Gun is definitely worthy patronising time and time again
5
Great food - amazing beef wellington (crispy pastry), very tender beef cheek dish. Fantastic choice of cheeses for those who miss the real flavours of cheese. Chose a bottle of red which was really nice and had excellent service. Great choice for dinner with friends.
5
Had the Easter special meal today and was blown away, great food great service followed by a few beers at the tranchard arms next door perfect sunday afternoon...
5
Quite a few selection of house draft beers that goes very well with the beef burger or the lamb burger. Well trained and very accommodating staff.
4
It was good to have good western food after 2 weeks of Asian food. Good service and tasty food - well worth a visit
2
What a disappointment from the last couple of times we have been there.We all had the Sea Bass which was overcooked however what was maddening was paying $5 for a bowl of vegetables which turned out to be broccoli only and the side salad($5) were a few lettuce leaves.Nothing at all was served with the fish......not a chip in sight! We did complain about the salad so they brought us another bowl of leaves only !
5
The adjoining bar (Trenchard Arms) is one of our regular haunts for a few beers and a pie or fish & chips, but tonight we went to RCG. We were welcomed on a busy Saturday night by an enthusiastic waitress who cleared a table for us immediately, took our order promptly and brought us a decent bottle of wine. We were pleased to receive the starters together, followed by the main course together, followed by dessert. Not unusual in UK but something of a challenge it appears here in SG.Pumpkin soup was creamy and delicious, the goats cheese and beetroot salad very colourful and tasty, the beef cheek beautifully cooked, the sausages were pork (none of the tasteless chicken stuff), and the cheese platter one of the best I have had in many years in SE Asia for the price. About 160SGD for the food and wine for the two of us, very reasonable.My only complaint was that some of the menu items were unavailable, which is a bit disappointing as the menu is not that large.Otherwise, an excellent meal, well presented by attentive and hard working staff.It won't be long before we're back
5
Though I was only in the room to sleep - in after midnight, out before eight - I had a wonderful experience staying at Rabbit Carrot Gun. The Kubrick Room was spacious, the bed comfortable, great shower and air conditioning, and I loved the number of windows that lined the room
5
The 'god-family' gathered for surprise brunch for my godson. We had a terrific time, thanks to Rabbit's warm service, especially from Chris and also our female wait staff. Thanks, Rabbit
5
Stumbled upon this restaurant on an idle weekday afternoon. Was immediately attracted by the quaint decor. Ordered a beef burger which was really tasty. The staff recommended me the Carrot Cake and I am glad I took it. It was simply delicious. Ended the meal with a lovely cup of coffee enjoying the unique ambiance of this restaurant. Will certainly come back for the brunch 
4
Cozy little corner on Ceylon Rd with a great chilled vibe, perfect for a casual afternoon brunch over the weekend. Good selection of breakfast/brunch mains on the menu along with freshly squeezed juices and some good coffee. The place got pretty busy as it was a Saturday so reservations are highly recommended. The Aussie owner is friendly and at hand to offer recommendations. A nice change to the usual dining options on East Coast Rd.
5
Excellent food, wine & drinks. The service was really good. Two thumbs up! I will definitely go back for more.
5
We stayed in the Brittannia suite and Comfortable suite. Very nice rooms and perfect. We liked to location in the Chinese part of Singapore and close to East Coast Park also. Very good breakfast and the food was excellent. Very nice staff, especially Chris who was really helpful.If you are looking for something different then a normal hotel so is this a perfect choice
5
This is a jewel in Singapore's East Coast Road!. Excellent food - excellent wine / drinks and excellent service. I can recommend the Shepherd's Pie in a heart-beat. The 'Carrot cake' is to die for (shame there's no rabbit on the menu!) and the wine selection is very very good. I find it difficult to believe the past two reviews. The staff are very hard working and attentive, courteous and diligent. Helmi, Wincey and Chris are very good and making you feel welcome with a warm smile and a chat. We visited several times once we unearthed this 'gem of a bar' and each time were made to feel extremely welcome without being over faced with service etc. A relaxed and stylish place to eat and drink. Wonderfully charming and fair food and price. The bar next door is a very good place for a late night drink - The Trenchard Arms - the staff here are just as attentive. Say hello to 'Butch' the (wooden) dog at the bar and ask Jansen to do his rainbow colour cocktail trick - superb! A must place to visit. The food is 'excellent'. Include this place on your list to go to in Singapore

This is my first time giving a 1 rating on TripAdvisor (after more than 280 reviews), which really says something about the place. The service was so bad that we decided to leave less than 5 minutes after sitting down.We read the great reviews and decided to try the place for lunch/tea. We walked up to the front of the restaurant, browsing the menu as we waited to be seated. There were two staff members in the place, both of whom were cleaning glasses, and only one other table was occupied -i.e. they were very free. The lady at the counter glanced at us, then continued her all-important job of cleaning the drinking glass. The other fellow didn't even look up. We decided to seat ourselves, and proceeded to continue perusing the menu. My girlfriend caught the lady's eye again, and gave her a smile. The lady pretended not to notice, and went back to cleaning her glass (really serious about clean glasses here). I beckoned her over when we were ready to order, which was when she finally decided to render some service -she curtly told us that everything we were looking at wasn't available at this time, and that only a very limited one-page menu was being served. We were already rather irked at this point, but decided to take the high road and politely told her we'd take a few more minutes to look through the new menu before ordering. Without so much as an apology, she then proceeded to separate one of our tables (we'd been sitting at a 'double' table, one of those set-ups where two tables are joined together to make it a 4-pax table) -something I completely couldn't comprehend, given the sheer emptiness of the place. In short, this extremely unprofessional and rude waitress turned us off the place entirely, and we decided to leave -definitely never to return. One of the worst restaurant experiences I've ever had
5
We went during Chinese New Year weekend and they were busy! Had to wait 20mins for a table but we were happy to do so as we didn't book and nothing else was open near by. It was worth the wait. My husband had the Game Keepers Breakfast and he was all smiles that they have proper sausages and real back bacon. I had the Eggs Benedict and have to say the Hollandaise Sauce was lovely and buttery. Our girls had the Kids Breakfast and the Muesli with Yoghurt and Berries....neither of them left anything on their plates. We did have a wait for the food but they were really busy! The staff let us know ahead of time about the delays so we were happy to wait. To be honest this gave us time to enjoy the coffee and catch up with the kids. We will be back making sure we book ahead of time although from what our server told us they are not usually that busy
1
Great reviews, great atmosphere, great to look and hear on the outside. But when you finally go, disappointment. Maybe I caught them on a bad day, maybe not. But I felt cheated. Obviously fantastic marketing from my opinion because the food and service was nothing close to the value of the prices offered. Terribly expensive, and waited over an hour for our food. And guess what we ordered? Bacon and eggs, lamb burger and eggs benedict. Hardly something that justifies waiting an hour for. And if this is how they run brunch, I can't even begin to think of how they'd run their dinners, etc.Service was mediocre. Not a single smile or apology for the long wait. If your restaurant screws up with a customer the least your staff can do is be apologetic and sincere. Bad place. Good marketing
5
I've been to Singapore a few times now and thank goodness I found this place.If you're after tasty, delicious food you can't beat RCG. This is gourmet pub food with a stylish and inviting atmosphere. If you like beer your sorted. If want a proper breakfast your sorted. If you want friendly staff your sorted. Make sure you try the Beef Wellington!Don't miss this gem
5
We stayed a week in one of the amazing studios just over Rabbit Carrot Gun and enjoyed several meals here, breakfast, brunch and dinner. They are all warmly recommended, especially the brunch! Its a warm inviting atmosphere in the restaurant, and the staff is super nice. We felt very at home and when coming back to singapore we would return to both stay and eat at rabbit carrot gun
5
Rabbit Carrot Gun has a great relaxed feel. The food was great and service was very good. I had The Game Keepers Breakfast which actually used Back Bacon rather than Streaky Bacon that you seem to find everywhere else.Would be back for sure!
4
The Turkey, Sausages, Potatoes, Carrots, Brussel Sprouts with Gravy, Creamy Sauce, Cranberry Sauce were all delicious. We were walking by and decided on a lark to eat here - checked Trip Advisor of course. The reviews were all correct. Very good food. Perfectly cooked. The service was prompt, courteous. It was not cheap @S$59 per person, but it was quite tasty. So tasty in fact that I wish the portions had been more celebratory - it was Christmas Eve so heaping large portions would have been best. And the dessert was awesome, Chocolate Mousse. Not too sweet and plenty "chocolatey" even for a chocolate lover like myself. Will be back to test the other offerings and fully expect to enjoy those as well. Best thing was my wife's smiling face across from me as she enjoyed her meal - priceless... unfortunately they do not accept Amex (my payment method of choice). Would have been 5 stars if they did. Still, 2 Thumbs Up
5
Had brunch on recent Sunday,Restaurant was full when i arrive but not a long waiting time actually. Was greeted pleasantly and seated by helmy if i got the name right. Had delicious eggs pacifico and of coz the fine favorite cafe latte. Great job rabbits!

What keeps me going back?1. Craft Beers on tap!!!! Really sweet deals (probably the best in Singapore!) on some of the best local craft beers (Wheat, IPA, Porter)...None of the flavored lagers that the largest industrial brewery in town peddles as craft beer....2. Ambience. This place has the vibe of an upmarket gastropub/lounge without the pretentiousness. The decor is retro chic while retaining the character of the neighborhood. 3. Service. Very friendly staff who show enthusiasm for what they are doing. None of the wooden (yet professional) service you tend to get these days.4. Food. I'll admit I am not a big fan of traditional English cuisine but their menu is a mix of the familiar with some unusual fare (rabbit anyone?) that makes me want to be more adventurous and open....so far all the dishes I have tried have been good
5
I LOVE this place! The food is fresh, delicious, and ready quick. The service is most excellent, the staff Richard, Wincy, Yat's amazing coffee skills, Jensen at the bar, Helini, Sean, and manager Chris are all like family! Everyday for 10 days (except on Monday when they are closed) I ordered their array of fresh juices, couscous, salads, and fresh yummy coffee. I am a vegan and author of "The Fit and Sexy Vegan" releasing in January 2014, and I am recommending this place in my book!I brought friends here and we all enjoyed the ambience, relaxed vibe, and friendly atmosphere. It's great for a meeting, date, or just to hangout, too. Everytime i'm in Singapore, I'm stopping here! I actually completed a 4 day juice cleanse and used only their fresh juices! I'm very grateful for the team, and the living accommodations that made my trip to Singapore perfect. Thank you!
5
I've visited the Rabbit Carrot Gun every day for the last 10 days and even rented a nice room with terrace and outdoor bathtub(!) on the 1st floor above the Rabbit.I've had more than 25 friends and business associated meet up and hang out with me here over the last ten days, and everybody likes the great coffee, freshly made juices, potato salad, quiche and more...This is a great place in an already great area known for great food and Singapore atmosphere.Thank you to Richard, the 5-star barista Yai, Jansen, Helmi, Wincy, Sean and Chris for making every visit in the Rabbit Carrot Gun pleasant and a high-quality experience :-
5
Very happy to while away my sunday eating great food and drinking great wine. Chris was very helpful and knowledgeable about the wine and good laugh when he came over to the table - definately a repeat visit soon and looking forward to the sunday roasts soon - Willia
5
Very relaxed restaurant with a serious motivation to make excellent food and beer. Highly recommend to anyone, Brits and non-Brits! Have spent a good amount of time on a Sunday and have also popped in for dinner before. For sure worth a try, because you'll for sure get the urge to come back! Nice thing is that even with heavy British food, they still have really good healthy salads and little bites of other things. Get down there already
5
Great location and surrounding,great buzz too.We had a simple and delicious food. Gamekeepers,Benedict n Pacific.Food served to us being introduce & n having a smile always keep it up elmi. Great location and surrounding,great buzz too
4
Rabbit Carrot Gun has a lot of great things, but what you might not realize is that they have the best burger in Singapore. Perfect for a midday lunch, or for dinner. We've tried and liked many different dishes there, but we keep going back for the burger. Highly recommended
5
I recently heard of Rabbit Carrot Gun and decided to check them out for a weekend brunch. Such a sweet little spot!! It's got a great ambiance and surprisingly helpful staff (when compared to other places I've been to in the area). Wincy and Chris were the two people that I interacted with most and were fantastic. Always smiling and rushing about, but never too busy to notice when someone needed a water refill or another coffee. I had the Eggs Benedict with perfectly cooked eggs which I had yet to have in Singapore! And the coffee was really tasty too. (Though I do think this dish needs a side with it as it's not as big as other other places I've tried)
5
Perfect and cozy place for brunch on a sleepy drizzly Sunday weather. Their Egg Benedict is lovely and their coffee is wonderful
5
RCG does fantastic breakfast, lunch and dinner. The staff are awesome, really friendly and helpful. The service is much better than the usual Singapore standard. I've lost count of the number of times I've been there and have never had a bad experience.
5
My father and I invested a great deal of time and energy in the 1990s visiting many public houses in Wiltshire, Hampshire, Dorset and Sussex in the UK trying to find the perfect pub Ploughmans : how odd that I finally discovered it on the East Coast in Singapore !!!I visited RCG with my husband and daughter and they were also delighted with the food : fish and chips and beef burger respectively, but I just can't wax lyrical enough about the Ploughmans : 3 large pieces of warmed ( must be warm !) crusty bread, quality butter, huge chunk of cheddar, salad, proper Branston pickle, loads of ham ( a lovely big pile ) and a pickled onion. I was in heaven !! Dessert was also great : cupcakes for my daughter, a Melting Moments for my husband and a gorgeous slice of Victoria Sponge for me. All in all a really lovely lunch and highly recommend to anyone also looking for the Holy Grail of pub lunches !!
5
Myself and my family went to dinner on 29th September,ordered proper prawn cocktail,goat cheese and beef Wellington. Overall food met our expectation. Beef was perfectly cook. Not to forget the prawn was so delicious.Staff on duty was friendly and attentive. The guy who serve our table never fail to smile even though he had to refill our empty glasses couple of times. Please do send our compliments to the chef and also the staff who serve us with a smile always.Definitely we will come back and recommend to our friends.Great job for having such a great place to dine
5
Recently went to dine in for a dinner and to my surprise the service staff was prompt and friendly. Unfortunately I cant recall his name was.Food was great too,we had beef Wellington. We'll be back soo

My wife and I went to Rabbit Carrot Gun for dinner last night. The ambiance was pleasant and my wife was delighted by the restaurant's great signage and the rabbit on her rabbit pot pie. However the food was very dense and better for cold weather. Singapore is very hot and humid so the food doesn't match the environment. Even if it was cold, the rabbit pot pie was missing fresh herbs and the pork belly was heavy
5
An excellent venue on East Coast Road, which is strating to become quite the culinary location. Rabbit Carrot Gun provides a pleasant environment, relaxed with very attentive staff happy to help you out. The menu is a very good English country fair, with the likes of venison, pork and of course the signature rabbit pie. All the dishes that our group had were cooked to perfection. The wine list although not large had a very good selection including some not so common Australian reds all at reasonable prices.Definitely a keeper and worth a visit if you like hearty meals, well prepared and very tasty
5
Great selection of craft beers and super friendly hospitality. Perfect place for a lazy afternoon! Menu has plenty of selection with some great pub snacks! We tried the buckshot IPA which was full of flavour and refreshing. Simple and effective cocktail list
4
A chilled and friendly atmosphere - a nice selection of beer. The food was British in a very good way – fantastic English cheeses, huge steak and ale pie and cottage pie too. The staff were attentive and very pleasant. I’m going back soon

As a newish Katong resident my better half and I have been working our way through the eateries of east Coast road. I’m now stoked that we’ve added Rabbit, Carrot, Gun to our ‘collection’. In the space of a week we have been lucky enough to indulge in two meals here, one brunch and one dinner, as well as imbibe a decent quantity of the establishment’s liquid refreshment. Breakfast: we were seated inside – so a little cramped but that allowed plenty of opportunity to enjoy the neighbouring table’s conversation whenever we fell into coupley silences ;-) The food was really very good without being great. Portions sizes looked a little small when they arrived but turned out to be spot on and at a very affordable price (for western fare). Eggs benedict at $13.50 and scrambled eggs on toast at $9.50. Also the missus was able to enjoy a rare de-caf soy latte. Probably not quite Sydney coffee-snob quality (but then they wouldn't be seen dead with a de-caf), though pretty decent for Singapore. Supper: Wow. Just wow. Loved it – from the most succulent ‘proper’ prawn cocktail starters (a real updating - it certainly didn't feel like 1975!) to perfectly cooked and fresh tasting beef cheeks, beef wellington and lamb shank. The missus doesn't usually eat red meat but on this night managed to wolf down the beef cheeks and do a pretty good job of ‘just tasting’ my lamb shank several times. Wow. Then there’s the desert. The choice is just cruel and our only disappointment was being too full to have more than one each. The apple pie and custard was quite something (wish the custard was warm though… but sure Singapore weather doesn't lend itself to that). I understand the Pavlova was also excellent, though I didn't sample. Given its questionable heritage (Aussie or Kiwi) I partake of it about as often as I do Russell Crowe films or music by Crowded House. The final recommendation would be to try ‘The Bogan’ a rather nice Shiraz from Barossa. A bloody good drop mate!Service: Some good feedback here. We hadn’t booked for dinner but were very helpful seated after only a few minutes (spent the time sampling ale at the bar - American Ale was my personal fav). We also ordered an off-menu dish (some vegetables on the side) and despite a little hiccup (a side salad was brought initially) this was resolved with good humor. The usual challenge of attracting service did arise – a short walk to the counter did ensure that the order was taken or the bill presented.Altogether the service was fine, the brunch affordably good and the supper really great; well presented, beautifully prepared. My one tip – please eat you main before the missus gets to taste it or you might lose it forever
5
This is the only place I have done 2 reviews on but we had such a good experience last night I had to write about it. Walked in and asked the waitress what red wine does the owner drink. So she just texted him and he texted back instantly! And it was not the most expensive on the list! Which we were about to buy! And that sums up this gem of a bar/restaurant/meeting place. My daughter and my niece were very hungry. They ordered the beef wellington for two. It came out and disapeared within 10 minutes with gravy mopped up also. We had the Liver and it was OMG just like grandma's. Perfecly cooked and flavour to die for. Bravo to all at RCG. The best bar in Singapore, South East Asia and West London. This place - keep it quiet!!
5
Anywhere that sells Scotch eggs and a pint called "Blonde bombshell" gets my vote. Great food , staff, food and drink.
Finally somewhere in Singapore that understands the word service as well. We've been many times so far and will continue to frequent.
5
Rabbit Carrot Gun is a great find; attentive service, relaxed environment, superb beef wellington, and a nice selection of cheese.
5
A great concept - tasty fresh food with good service. And wholesome family style pies makes a visit to RCG one that will be repeated
5
I visited Rabbit , Carrot , Gun after an excellent recommendation from my friend Richard. He was not wrong!! Absolutely brilliant menu, classic ex pat dishes served with a friendly smile and a great atmosphere. Singapore has long been after this sort of place. I will be bringing all my friends and family back. The specially made beer from a small micro brewery were excellent, and well presented by the staff member. The pale ale is a must... along with a cheeky scotch egg!
4
I visited this restaurant with a group of people. It can be a little tricky to spot as the sign is small and high on the building. It is a small establishment featuring seasonal organic foods. I had Quiche Lorraine with Beet Root Salad and Grilled Vegetables. The food was very good, pastry for the quiche was light and flaky and the filling was moist and flavorful although it was on the salty side for my pallet. The Beet Root salad was very nice, the grilled vegetables were good but could have used a touch of salt. This is a very clean and cozy location. It's evident that it is run by a cook who strives to provide a very good quality product. I'm certain that I'll return to Rabbit Carrot Gun again and again
5
We stayed at Sleepy Hollow which is just across the road from Rabbit Carrot Gun so we had the opportunity to have breakfast lunch and dinner at the restaurant. We enjoyed every meal and kept going back for more. Everything is fresh and cooked on the premises which is a real treat in Singapore where more and more restaurants are shipping food from central kitchens. Our favourites are French Toast for breakfast and Beetroot Pasta for lunch. The Lamb Shank we had fo dinner was well braised and super tender. We have yet to try the Fish Pie. Give yourself 20-25 minutes for the fish pie as it is made from scratch. Hope to go back there soon
1
Was warned by a friend that its wasn't very good but we thought we would try it out ourselves as it looks quaint from the outside.Food very average and expensive. 4 drinks and fish and chips for $80.Owner also arrogant and rude. There are much better options around. Try Oh Deli further up the road, great food and vibe
5
A huge pat on the back to Lord Trenchard and team at RCG. I had heard whispers about the restaurant and adjoining pub, The Trenchard Arms, from mates in Singapore, and, finally got myself to Sing to sample its manifold delights. I was not disappointed at all - this is a great venue for a top bite and hearty ale or other libation. Conviviality in spades...The cuisine is unpretentious yet highly original and simply yum-a-licious! The prices are very fair too, given Singapore's propensity to over-charge and under-deliver.And, last but not least, the service was on the mark - friendly, prompt but not overwhelming with a sincere and engaging touch.I enjoyed this place so much for dinner with friends, and, when the owner (aka Lord T) advised me the Lions rugby was showing at his watering-hole, I was simply compelled to return to savour the food, gorgeous ale and hearty atmosphere once more. And a thumping Lions win! Say no more. I will be back for sure for more. Any chance of a RCG in Kota Kinabalu, I beg to ask?
5
If you are looking for a great cup of coffee, wine and a home cooked meal this is the place to come on East Coast Rd. Comfortable seating, service with a smile, warm welcome by owners who are always there to greet customers. Whether you stop by in the morning for quick breakfast or evening meal you will never be disappointed.
4
We had a weekend breakfast with the family at the new restaurant on East Coast Road. The staff was very nice and attentive - great for singapore - and the breakfast was freshly cooked. Highlight were the eggs benedict.Also like the Jungle beer that came as a recommendation after breakfast. Definitely coming bac
4
Lovely atmosphere, convenient location and great team running the show. Sensibly-priced wines, good selection of beers and decent grub. More gastro-pub in style and well worth checking out if you're in Kallang.
5
Carrot Gun is a great place with fantastic staff and amazing breakfast menu! We've met an owner Richard who made sure we had a real treat! I am looking forward to coming back for dinner. Highly recommended!
5
Reserved a seat via Chope.com.sg for 12pm on a Sunday.Arrived an hour earlier and was seated at a nice place inside the cafe.In my reservation, I indicated under the requests portion that I would liket o have Casserole of Mushrooms. Was surprised to not find it in the menu.Enquired with the manager and was pleasantly surprised that the chef decided to do it for me despite the dish being only available for dinner. So was glad they went the extra mile.Food was small portion but was good. If the food is not enough to fill your stomach, there's always Katong Laksa across the road.Ambience was kinda retro with nice furniture, paintings and photographs.Cozy place for chatting and chilling
5
Best carrot cake in Singapore from far! I can tell not just because fresh ingredients, delightful and warm service but a lot of passion, care & love they put in every little detail. A lovely place to chill in the heart of East Coast Area. Brunches during the weekend are awesome! And watch out, the rabbit is always ready to play, so get ready! ;-
5
Excellent food. Great ambiance. Perfect place for weekend brunch and weeknight dinners. Plus the owner is extremely friendly and makes sure everyone feels welcome and comfortable
3
Tried the brunch at RCG recently. Liked the English styled cafe / bistro and a good variety of breakfast and lunch choices. Friendly staff and good service. Unfortunately there is a massive roadwork happening so it was rather noisy and dusty especially in the middle of the day. Also facing a busy street closeby the entrance didn't help as well :( The food did make up for the noise outside. And not forgetting the best scone we've tried so far. Fluffy, warm inside and taste great with their homemade jams (passion friut jam was good balance of sour with butter). A mid-sized glass of juice cost $7!!! That was a shocker..
5
This place served great food even during the Singapore haze! The pie is something special- you could tell it was freshly made. It was difficult to choose off the menu - many delicious options. Loved the beer, atmosphere and ambiance! A must visit

9.40pm, no food... It's ok though as the Trenchard next door has light bites. Ah but it doesn't, chef's gone AWOL. Nice beer and friendly service though. Some odd discontinuities between the places - eg you can order beer but not food from the bar menu if you are in the restaurant, and though the bar supposedly serves after 9.30pm, the staff seems unclear

On arrival at lunch at 1pm we were told 4 dishes were off the menu. Disappointing but nevertheless we made our choice from the remaining options. Having ordered we were subsequently told that the linguine was off too so we both ordered the ham ploughmans. It arrived with no "aged cheddar" so I questioned it. The chef forgot apparently. A slice of definitely non-aged cheddar arrived for each on a side plate. The bread was stale and we had not been told it would be raisin and nut bread which we would not have chosen. We were offered no butter. Service was terrible, we constantly had to "flag" for service despite there being only 4 people in the entire restaurant. No service with a smile - just very disappointing

We had brunch here on a Saturday morning. The wait staff were very attentive and the food was delivered promptly. I had an Eggs Benedict and my partner had the Big Breakfast, both were very tasty. We also stayed upstairs in one of the rooms that Richard has available on Air BnB. Our stay went very smoothly and it was great to be able to pop downstairs for our morning coffees, which were also consistently good quality. We'll be back next time we're in Singapore

You will be transported back to the good old English country with the restaurant decor and style cooking. The menu has limited choices but the food served was delicious and well seasoned. I had the privilege of trying the Beef Cheek and it was awesome and the portion was just right - tender and succulent! The carrot unfortunately was a tad bit under cook nonetheless it was a great meal. And to compliment the whole experience was the simple and beautiful decor and theme that makes perfect sense to dine in the evening. My compliment to the team behind the restaurant Rabbit Carrot Gun, especially the chef. Kudos to the owner for bringing in a new dining experience to the a East Coast - Katong

We were recommended this place by a friend and after looking at their website we were quite excited by the sound of the food and decided to book. Our experience was mixed and on the whole, we felt there was a lot that could be improved. Good things about this place...1) Interesting concept, great branding2) The place looks great generally, a really good corner location with a big outdoor area and small but well decorated indoor space (apart from one very large & bizarre painting on the wall) 3) Really nice atmosphere and for once really good temperature control inside - not crazy cold air conditioning!4) The menu options all sounded tasty and the food we ordered was pretty goodThings that need improving...1) Service, service, service! From start to finish this was (in the nicest possible way) pretty awful. They have a very bizarre ordering system where the waiter uses an i-phone to take your orders - our waiter was so confused with the whole thing that we had to repeat our orders twice while he tried to programme it in. This was really frustrating and it also meant there was absolutely no eye contact or interaction with the waiter who was so focused on resolving the technology that he could not really connect with us. Another member of staff then came over to re-confirm the order with us (which had been incorrectly programmed into the sytem). This happened twice during the visit, the second time when I ordered a glass of white wine and after ordering via the i-phone someone came over to ask me if I had ordered red! Bring back good old fashioned pen and paper ordering I say, which would have been faster and would have been a much more intimate way of ordering food with our hosts. There were a lot of other small things with regards to service which sound petty but when you combine them over the course of an evening it just ruins the whole experience: - we asked to move tables and no one offered to help us move our glasses and cutlery - we did it ourselves- getting anyone's attention was near impossible (the table next to us was also getting frustrated)- when our drinks ran out no one asked if we wanted new ones - when I requested more tap water, only my glass was refilled (and not my partners)Overall on service, the staff are well meaning but inexperienced and untrained to deal with common circumstances that may arise over the course of an evening. If it was my restaurant I would halve the number of staff and have fewer but more effective people running the place.2) Small details like the menu - with such a fantastic looking website we expected this to be consistent with the feel of the place. The menu is laminated paper and just felt cheap.3) There are no vegetarian main courses - despite having three vegetarian starters (four if you include the special) they have no vegetarian mains. This seems quite strange! I ended up having a starter as my main which was fine but it was actually quite similar (to my actual starter) in terms of the ingredients used which was fine but a bit disappointing4) I have a soft spot for crumble and had high hopes - it was quite disappointing and I couldn't believe how small the portion was for the price. Three bites and it was gone!5) Prices generally - I felt the prices were just too high to justify the evening! This was a long way for us to come (SGD 20 each way in a taxi) and it would be difficult to justify the total cost of the evening for us to return

There's something really special about this place and it's difficult to put your finger on it. Even the first few times we went it felt like 'our' local. An incredibly warm and friendly atmosphere as if everyone had known each other a long time. Although it hasn't been open long, it feels like it has and it feels like it 'belongs', and that it has defined this corner plot for many years. It definitely makes perfect use of the space, with the colours and decor that are in harmony with the surroundings of this historic area. The service is very personal and more often than not the 'Head Gamekeeper' will pop over for a chat - genuinely looking for feedback and insights. The food is great, old fashioned english fayre. The sausage rolls were sensational and we requested the waiter to 'leave the tray'! Overall, a great find and we hope RCG and all the staff see the success they so deserve. Great job

My friends and I had decided to check out the place early this month. The food was ok. The real appeal of the place is probably its nice atmosphere. Will probably be back for drinks and chit chats with my friends

Great food & drinks, really good value and all in a chilled out setting, well done Rabbit Carrot Gun finally someone in Singapore is taking British food seriously

I have lived in Singapore for over 10 years, and sometimes a lot of the food outlets can get a bit bland and 'same same', but happy to say this place does not fit that stereotype.Everything from the name, to the slightly eccentric decor, and a whole range of items on the menus that I had not seen before……it was a bit different to most days out for lunch.But more than just looking different, the food was superb, the service was pretty good (for Singapore), and at last a place with beers other than Tiger and Heineken! My friends were big fans of their specially brewed Buckshot Ale, and I think I drank them out of the Blonde Bombshell!In fact, we enjoyed it so much that an initial 2 hour lunch booking turned into us getting kicked out at closing time!!We will be back!

What a great little restaurant!I have been to Rabbit Carrot Gun (RCG) a few times, and it has never failed to impress at both a food and service level. For such a young restaurant they have done an amazing job on all fronts.The Food; I think the food is great, from the "proper prawn cocktail" which is exactly that, through to the Sausages with Bubble & Squeak - I have not had anything to complain about. The food is a brilliant mix of homely fare through to a nice flair without being pretentious. A nice mix on the menu without being stupidly long. The food has obviously been sourced very well as the quality of the end product really differentiates from many other restaurants which would be in the same price range. The service; I think the service makes the place. With the senior management obviously getting their hands dirty in running the place and being on hand to help if they need to. Again, I think a big difference from many other restaurants, where you are obviously just dealing with 'employees'. I've not had anything to complain about but any query or request I have had has been dealt with in a friendly manner.The atmosphere; As I said, I've had a few visits and they have been varied in what I was looking for from a venus and I have found RCG to be flexible enough for all of them. I have had business breakfasts, business dinners, personal dinners and I held a team evening for 20 people at dinner. Each time the restaurant has provided a great venue appropriate to the occasion.The whole atmosphere seems to be a great reflection of the team who built the place, it's old school english hospitality without the pomp. What you'd expect from an amazing farm house B&B in the UK.The success is evident as a few times I have stopped in only to see the place packed, so I would definitely recommend booking

Great value for money and food very good. Lamb burger is awesome!The ambiance is fantastic and the service staff were always around and ready to serve. Happy smiley people!Would defiantly come back again it was lovely

Rabbit Carrot Gun is a great place to go and have breakfast, lunch or dinner. I think that this is a place that you can buy fantastic food for a affordable price. I will definitely be coming back here sometime during the next week

If you are staying in the Katong/East Coast area and fancy real comfort food and great wine in a relaxing atmosphere, this is the place to head to. I have only just discovered it, and I have been back 3 times already on this tripr for brunch and dinner

We have been several times to Rabbit Carrot Gun over the last few months and have never been disappointed. Great food and wine whether you eat in the restaurant or drop by the bar for a snack. We have had breakfast lunch and dinner at RCG and have always enjoyed the experience and pleasant atmosphere. The staffing issues some people have mentioned have been greatly overblown. Yes it is a challenge getting good local staff in the F&B business, perhaps is would be more constructive for some of the reviewers to write to the Singapore Ministry on Manpower. It is they who are responsible for bringing down service standards in Singapore by imposing restrictions on the hiring of foreign workers who are generally much better at hospitality than Singaporeans! We will be back

Few places in Singapore I'd rather spend an afternoon getting caught up on work and having a coffee. Love the ambiance, love the lamb burger, love the smoothies. Highly recommended

My wife and I like to stop by RCG at least once a month for their delish gamekeepers breakfast! It never fails to delight! I love their choc smoothies too. Nom! ?;-

None of the staff seems to care if you are there or not. No welcome, no smiles, no thank you. Food average

We enjoyed the food and it was really tasty, good wines on the list but the service just let the place down; we appreciate they are starting to use a new app system for ordering but it just wasn't working; our waiter needed training but then we were intermittently served by another member of staff and he was really good. Took ages to get our drinks etc etc anyway wouldn't stop us going again

This is a lunch date and the place is recommended by my friendI've never expected a British eatery at katong - the ambience is nice except that it's not air-conditioned (yes, I'm a typical Singaporean who needs her AC). My friend told me that they're serving all organic food with no salt added. We ordered the capsicum quiche with warmed pumpkin salad, prawn cocktail and bread with brie cheese. Trust me, none of the food was bland. They were all yum! Loved the quiche - great capsicum flavor with no so 'sickening' taste of the egg/cheese filling of quiche. Greatest was the pumpkin salad-soft and fragrant. Brie was soft and mellow - great on the multigrain bread.service was prompt and good. Owner is very knowledgeable abt her food.I'll definitely be back again

In spite of the good reviews above our experience was far from good. Egg Pacifico - food cold coffee weak and poor service. Won't go back

Been here a few times with friends and family. You need to book for dinner at weekends, but should be OK just turning up during week. Make sure you get a table inside or under awning at front. Tables down side street are poor and can be dangerous, with open gratings and passing pedestrians. Very friendly staff and owner, who will chat about food, wine, origins and everything. Some good beers and very reasonable range of wines. The genuine prawn cocktail starter is the best ever. If you like sausage and mash, this is the place to come. Deserts are mouth watering.

Stumbled on this gem by accident when it first opened and I've been going back ever since. One of my favorites is the braised beef. Omg! cooked for 8 hours and melts into that lovely gravy. The bread and butter pud is simply wonderful. Those two are my all time favorite and keep on coming back to it though the other items on the menu are pretty good too. The head chef is English and knows her stuff so you know you are getting basically good English recipes. The breakfast is good too

As it would have been Mother's Day at home in N. Ireland, my daughter-in-law kindly researched a restaurant that understood Gluten Free food so that we could all enjoy a meal as a family. We were not disappointed. The menu at Rabbit Carrot gun was discussed with me by a knowledgable and informed chef who fully understood the finer concerns of Coeliacs dining out. The majority (or was it all??) dishes were available to me - my problem was choosing which one from the very inviting Brunch menu. In the end I chose the lamb burger with beetroot and tzatziki accompanied with chips. It was delicious and what a treat to eat a burger (100% lamb) and to know there would be no ill effects - and there were none!! Everyone else, including my 19 month old grandson - none of them are Coeliac - had an equally enjoyable experience. The staff are all lovely - knowledgeable, intuitive, caring and friendly but not intrusive. A great meal out! Thank you to my son and to Rabbit Carrot Gun
