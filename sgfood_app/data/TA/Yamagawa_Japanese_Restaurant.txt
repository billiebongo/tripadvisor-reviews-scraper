Went on a Sunday lunch, not many people as is located in CBD area and some renovation surrounding. But the food was good, sashimi are reasonably fresh, service staff are friendly too. Using coupons and is super worth the price. Worth to eat there again.

Often have lunch here.
ALWAYS high quality food and service.
Set lunch menus are excellent and very good value, but a la carte also wonderful.
Reliably high quality of food and service, and modestly priced. Well worth a visit.

The restaurant is in the building connected to the hotel we stayed for one night.
The owner and the staff are courteous and friendly.
The food is good except for the price.

This is one of the GOOD Japanese restaurants in SINGAPORE. The restaurant has been established many years ago , the fact it is still around speak for itself. The restaurant has won many awards from JAPAN for the quality of their food. They serve TEPPANYAKI, SASHIMI, SUSHI, AND A-LA-CARTE ....the best way to order is tell the management what your budget for your meals and they will prepaid per your budget !!! This saves your problem of searching through the menu and doing your calculating !!! Both the quality, presentation of the food are good and the price reasonable. They also offer good SAKI DIRECT from the source !!! The service is good and staff friendly. AMBIENCE is acceptable. Location is good and can easily reached by most means of transport. BON APETITE !!

We had the teppanyaki and enjoyed the dinner temendously. The staff is courteous and very helpful. They have a few teppanyaki set, eg. beef and lobster, seafood, chicken, etc. so you know what you will end up paying for. The sashimi is fresh and the chawan mushi hot and sweet. They have a few private rooms as well if you need some privac

went there invited by regulars who negotiate the dinner directly with the head chef. (i did not get to see the menu or prices and we for sure got prime attention that may not be the case of all customers).we started with their own version of the Lo Hei. i am not a big fan of this tradition but i was polite and was prepared for the usual treatment. not at all. aside the fact that no one yelled, Yamagawa's version being made with fresh ingredient and their own spicing (including an excellent touch of wasabi on the raw fishes) is miles above anything i have endured in Singapore.the following sashimi plate was good, but typical of many reasonable Japanese restaurants i tried in Singapore (which excludes all cheap options, unfortunately). we got the chef give us a tutorial on his supply chain.grilled wagyu beef was good and tender, but one notch down the best i have tried taste wise (Australian ?).a very good evening, the restaurant not pushing us out at their closing time of 10pm and letting us chat and drink sake till over 11pm

We tried the teppanyaki dinner and opted for the ala carte order instead of the set dinner menu. I would think that the teppanyaki dinner was a let down. Limited choices and prices are high - $38 for a sirloin steak about 150 gram, $8.50 for thin slice salmon, $12 for two small bowl of garlic rice, $15 for cuttlefish, $10 for small portion mixed vegetable. At this restaurant, they do not use fresh minced garlic for cooking the food items at the teppanyaki table but instead, uses the pre-fried garlic bits. Other dishes we ordered like the Nigiri Sushi, futomaki are quite ok. Service good. Very spacious restaurant with private rooms

I often go for lunch because my office is near .This restaurant offers good variety of lunch-set.They are so good that Japanse people can be satisfied with them. I recommend Ton-katsu (pan-fried pig katlet). Although its size is not big, taste is good. It is also good that set-meal includes rice, miso-soup, salad, pickles, fruits.Every set costs 15-20 S$
