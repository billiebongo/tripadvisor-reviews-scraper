They served chinese food, and offers a great place for gathering with friends or families. Even great for birthday celebration :)
The obvious choice would be fried yam cubes, Xing Hua Bee Hoon, Lor Mee and the onion beef bun.
Price was reasonable.

despite develloping their business the main Putien still a must when it comes to Chinese cuisine. Slightly different, great sea food and ewffiucient service.

We enjoyed a very nice dinner with a variety of vegetarian & seafood dishes. The dishes were done differently compare to the normal chinese cooking and we visited the place twice with our family and friends.

I would recommend that you try the fried yam cubes, the pork ribs, cockles, clams and fried bee hoon. Price is quite reasonbale. Service is good and pretty fast.

We came here during the festive Chinese Lunar New Year period. We were a bit distraught with the menu overhaul for the festive season, and thus we were forced to choose only dishes presented in the set menus, as we didn't want to order the lunch set.The waitresses were also disrupted by our not ordering the set menu, and one even just walked away, when we haven't even finished ordering. Well, that 1 star may also just walk away...We ordered our favourites, 1 medium portion of "lor mee" and 1 small portion of beehoon. We also ordered 2 deep fried pork knuckles and 1 medium conpoy with mushrooms and brocoli.The noodles and vermicelli are the all-time favourites...The pork knuckles and the last dish did not disappoint : the knuckles were absolutely tender, fragrant and delicious. So were the brocoli, and the broth was well cooked in dried conpoy (scallops)

As Pu Tien is a chain, and there was not a separate review for the branch at ION on Orchard Street, I decided to combine this with the others.This is a restaurant designed for Cantonese patrons. All are welcome but understanding the nuance and appreciating the range of offerings requires specialised knowledge.The ION location was bustling at 8pm on Saturday and unsurprisingly was incredibly loud, consistent with Cantonese restaurants in general.The food was generally good although I thought the jellyfish was a bit tougher than I am used to having. They seem to have a specialty in fish called Croaker, which they can sautee, fry, or make into a soup. We had the soupy version which was very tender and tasty but beware that this fish has many small bones. There was also duck in taro root pastry that was nice and also quite filling. And they have a range of specialty juices that are worth trying for their exotic flavours. Soursop and barley were two very different tastes and we liked them both.Overall, the portions were a bit small but the bill was not bad at $80 for two including four dishes and extra drinks in a very nice part of town.They cater to families and even had staff making animal balloons they kept by the till for patrons needing something to distract the little ones

Pu Tien Restaurant specialises in Heng Hua (a southern Chinese dialect group) which very pleasantly surprised me. Growing up in a Hokien family, it was always inferred that Heng Hua food was the rough and ready type, with no finesse, no culinary skills whatsoever. How wrong we were! So when my cousin wanted to take me to a 1-Michelin Pu Tien at Kitchener Road, I was dubious but curious and what an experience it turned out to be.The restaurant is not big and the environment was not flash, but pleasant and elegant. Unlike a lot of Chinese restaurants, there was no loud music and no noisy patrons! We were welcomed warmly by a very pleasant head waitress lady (Ah Lian) of a certain age to our table. She gave us our menu and discreetly disappeared to allow us to browse the menu, after fetching us our Chinese tea.We had a variety of starters, the most impressive of which was the cold bitter gourd, beautifully sliced and artistically arranged in a dish of ice cubes. The ugly duckling (the bitter gourd) had turned into a piece of art! I could appreciate the patience and skill in presenting this dish. We also had some sweet and fresh, melt-in-your-mouth steamed shrimps, their signature fried yam cubes, fish soup, Xiang Hua noodles with the ‘can’t do without’ chilli sauce which they make daily in their own kitchen.Service was excellent; food was memorable and warranted the prices. All in all, a truly culinary adventure

Not only is the food good (earning Michelin 1 star), the service is also impeccable. The sweet and sour pork is unique and the best we ever had. The cockles are also prepared in a special way which makes you want to suck up the juice as well. Unfortunately the oyster egg is not fantastic

My friend's family always dines at this place and recommends me about Heng Hwa's authentic dishes. This was the first time I visited with them. The fried bee hoon and fried yam cube were so awesome and tasty! I would definitely visit again for more dishes I wish to try

We had heard about this restaurant from friends for a while and decided to have a family dinner there last month. Since it was a Sunday evening, we decided to make a reservation. The reservation process was smooth and fuss-free. We parked at City Square Mall about 250m away as there were limited kerbside lots in front of the restaurant. Service was excellent and the staff were attentive and helpful. The food was excellent as expected. We stayed with the house specialties and were not disappointed. Expect to pay about $25 to $35 per head for dinner, depending on what you order, but we thought it was worthwhile for the quality and taste we experienced
5
The restaurant is affordable and the food is really delicious. I really liked the fried noodles with prawns and the sweet and sour lychee pork. I will definitely visit them again.

They have changed their menu recently - otherwise, their sweet potato noodle is EXCELLENT, Between June to August, season for mini special soft shell snails - superbly tasty delicacy. There are many branches in Singapore. The one at Marina Sq & Nex Mall - quality not ba

This place serves authentic Heng Hwa cuisine. Love to eat their chicken cooked with wine and their clam mee saw. They also have fish sliced soup and vegetable stir fried with garlic. Great for family dinner. It is healthy and delicious. The price is also reasonable. Even my elderly parents love to eat here

OK, maybe it doesn't quit deserve five stars -- but there's nothing like finding a great nerw restaurant after a night of fasting for a morning full of blood tests. We came across Pu tien just as they were finishing their lunch service, but they very kindly let us make a quick order. And what a surprise it was! Pu tien services delicious Fujianese cuisine, a real change from the more familiar Teochew, Cantonese, and Shanghainese. Our lunch consisted of iced strips of bitter gourtd with a dipping sauce, two pig trotters that were braised to perfection in star anise broth before being breaded and fried, the house specialty of home-made very thin rice noodles in a rich, fragrant broth, and a smoky artisanal tea, which, at $6.90, ended up being the most expensive item in oiur menu. It was all great. If you like to cook, it's hard not to admire the cleanliness of the frying, the texture of the broth, or the contrast of the iced melon skin. The restaurant takes special pride in its homemade sambal on the side, but while my wife said it co,mlemented the food well, I thought that the flavours of the dishes were themseves already so clean and perfect that a sambal would have just confused things. A new favorite restaurant in Singapore

The location was a little inconvenient for families going there in a car, but it was well compensated by the quality of the food. The restaurant was nicely renovated, and the staff were helpful and friendly. Our food arrived in good time as well, and it was very satisfying. We spent about $20 per pax and I will go back there again

To start with, the reception at the front is excellent. Cool lemonade is served while guests wait for their seats.Our food order was taken while we waited.As soon as we were seated, our food was served.The servings come in small portions which is good so we can try several dishes.Most of the dishes are affordable. One of the high light of what we ordered is deep fried pig trottersAte with some guilt but consoled ourselves that is is colloge

We were accompanied by a local who made the food selections from a ample 'a la carte' and set menus, with the result that we enjoyed a primarily vegetarian cuisine with steamed soon hock as a main course. Overall the food was consistently good and the evening was enhanced by friendly service. Recommended for very good quality, wholesome food

Went there on a Friday evening for a birthday dinner. The food was of excellent quality though not particularly exciting. I am not an expert on Xinghua cuisine so cannot vouch for the authenticity, but the food didn't seem to me to be that different from standard Cantonese fare. The freshness and quality of the food was however, pretty good. For a very busy Friday evening, the service was excellent. It was obvious that the staff were pretty busy, but all through they kept their composure and was always pleasant and smiling. What particularly impressed us was that the waitress attentively noted that we were actually celebrating a birthday dinner, and quickly insisted on serving us a complimentary platter of birthday buns, complete with dry ice and candles. It was something completely unexpected, and done with such grace and charm even though the staff were so busy,Overall, a restaurant definitely worth supporting and patronizing even though the prices were slightly on the expensive side

good food .. but a bit pricy . tried their bee hoon, fried eggplant with pork floss and fried yam. The Yam and bee hoon are great, not so on the eggplant. Overall, i would recoomend this place to the others, just that the price are a bit high

I still like their Heng Hwa Bee Hoon

Good food, good service.
Steam prawns with herbs in bamboo is their signature dish - really yummy. Noodles, fried fish and steam clams are equally good.

Only by compulsion...

Good Xing Hua food. Try the garlic beef/pork (appetiser)

Food here's good actually...I'd rate this one of the better Chinese dining

The speciality of Putien (Xinghua) are their starters and side dishes. You will be overwhelmed with choices from the main and four-season menu. Chicken and Chinese Sausage roll offered in the Winter menu is a must try. Food was great!Service was a bit slow and they actually charge for plain water. More photos and information available at http://monsoontravel.blogspot.com/2012/01/nice-dinner-at-putien-nex.htmlChicken and Chinese Sausage roll 腊肠鸡卷 @$9.90 - Must try from the winter menu !!Drunken Cockle 品醉蚶 @$9.90- served cold with generous amount of minced garlic, chilli and spring onion with wine marinade - refreshingly good!Braised Pork Intestine 九转小肠 @$13.90- chewy dish with savoury braised sauce bursting out while you chewStir-fried Yam 酥炒芋头 - M @$16.90- sweet, crispy, caramelized sugar on the outside while savoury fluffy on the insideRecommend. Will definitely be back

Late Tuesday evening and the Silly Girl and her friends made a dash to Putien for dinner. Choice for the evening - drunken cockles, fried hing wah bee hoon, deep fried yam with duck, braised beancurd with chinese cabbage soup, sweet and sour pork with lychees. Lovely simple food for the soul with excellent service. Price is reasonable too! For more information, check out the review on my blog : http://sukyee.wordpress.com/2011/08/17/putien-kitchener-road

Usually, Chinese food is quite heavy. Not for Pu Tian.The food is light and tasty, and we enjoyed it very much.My father, sister and I had lunch at the Pu Tian @ Marina Square. Although there are 3 of us, we ordered the set menue for four. We "upgraded" the steamed seabass for steamed Soon Hock. The total bill comes up to S$138.05. I think it would have been better value if there were 4 of us instead of 3 !!Menu:1. Bamboo Herbal Prawns (Very fresh and crunchy prawns on clear soup)2. Sweet and Sour Pork with Lychee (Excellent !!)3. Claypot Sea Cucumber, stewed with chestnuts (Sea cucumber is not soft enough)4. Signature Fried Bee Hoon (never fails!)5.Steamed Soon Hock (5-Star restaurant standard)6. White Fungus with Lotus Seed Dessert (Chilled and clear!)I have, in the past, also tried their Braised Beancurd and Chinese Cabbage Soup. It is one of the best soups ever!The service is brisk and fast. However, the server tried to "push" all the high value items such as lobster and "special" tea to us.....

Great wholesome Fujian dishes. Must try. The clam mei fun is soooo good.

Homely food of the Xing Hua dialect group. Everything is fresh and full of ingredients. Lor mee is a must!

Quite ok for family dinner but prefer the fried mee hoon done at the heng hwa restaurant opposite of Concourse at Beach Road better

My clan restaurant. A must-go destination for any celebration in my family, set up by someone from our hometown in China. Try the honey-fried yam, stir-fried bee hoon and lor mee.
