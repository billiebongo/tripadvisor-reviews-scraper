I had heard Super things about the place including the Gluten Free Pizza. But sadly the Pizzas were kind of average. On the plus side I loved the alcoholic ginger beer and the staff was incredibly sweet.

Found out about this place googling gluten free pizza. Very cozy atmosphere, clean space, nice food. Perhaps they could be more generous with the ingredients, but overall a great experience. We’ll repeat!

This place is very peculiar, it has a very good selection of breads, jams, sweets and together with the bakery there is a pizzaria with sourdough pizza, really good.

Plank is part of Baker & Cook, serving pizzas only
Their pizzas are baked in an oven which is always
just nice, crispy without being over baked.

This is for the NAMLY Place branch. Excellent light sour dough pizzas. Freshly prepared. Nice selection of New Zealand beers as well.

Didn't know it was here! Amazing pizzas made with sourdough all fantastically freshly made and tasted great.

An exceptionally good pizza in a small & friendly restaurant. While there why not buy artisan breads, yummy cakes or pastries to eat in or take home. There is an assortment of wines and condiments as well.

As we had our pets with us, we were seated outside. It was a lovely cool evening and we thoroughly enjoyed the weather. First time here and we ordered the garlic bread which used the dough for the pizza as the base for the garlic. Thought it was very interesting and we enjoyed it as it was nice and crispy. The simple green salad was fresh. We also ordered the smoked bbq pork ribs and roasted chicken drumstick, both of which were not too bad and came without any sides. The gingerella ginger ale and lemmy lemonade came in interesting bottles too.

We tried out the garlic bread and drumsticks for starters. At $5, freshly baked dough was served. Generous amount of garlic pesto and u can drip Chilli oil to your liking. We already love how our meal started with. Wondered if we wanna order more but we waited since our main is coming.Next served were the bbq drumsticks. The home made bbq sauce is nice. However, we thought the extra sauce were a little redundant, since the drumsticks were lathered with copious amount of the same sauce. They were served hot but we felt it was too overpriced for 3 pieces of drumsticks. At $19.50, we expected the portion to be somewhat like a main course but we're disappointed. Comparing the average price of a pizza to be about $25, the drumsticks were not worth the money even though they're yummy.Next up, we ordered the smoked salmon pizza. Generous amount of salmon, we loved it a lot! The dough was cooked perfectly. Just the right amount of sauce and ingredient. I'll come back for sure and I know what to order and what not. Generally the ambience is nice and cosy. The desserts and pastries next door looks yummy but we were too full to order. Maybe next time

It must the best pizza in Singapore or pretty close. Sourdough base, cooked to a crispy bottom with generous toppings. They share the premises with Baker & Cook and you can choose from their menu too which is a bonus, but the pizza are the star of the show. The beer & wine menu is small but of really good quality and reasonable value and the service is friendly and attentive

Great pizza. Great pizza. Great pizza! I can't think of any other place in Singapore that serves pizza like them. In fact this is the defacto place when I crave for pizza in a small cafe

We ordered the garlic bread which was delicious. We just wished the garlic spread had been more! The smoked salmon pizza was not as great but maybe it just wasnt the right topping for a pizza. We also had the passionfruit cheesecake for desserts but we'd expected more from baker & cook. The cake was too heavy and it really could pass off as a typical cake from your local typical bakery.Service was patient, attentive and cheerful despite the hour. A huge plus point

We had dinner here yesterday and the meal was generally enjoyable. Plank is part of the Baker and Cook chain and is actually located at the back of the bakery.We ordered the garlic bread and it was lovely when it arrived - hot, garlicky and tasty. This was followed the No 4 pizza, with chicken, arugula and tomato sauce. The sourdough helps make the pizza chewy yet softer, and the pizza was delicious. They do not have any pasta dishes currently, focussing on their core strength of baking. We also ordered the blueberry cheesecake and chocolate lamington. Both were not as good as expected though. The cheesecake was a little on the heavy side, while the lamington needed more chocolate in it. Service was good and staff were attentive. Parking can be a hassle though as it is in a residential area, so go early. The road at Terang Bulan can also be narrow as cars are usually parked outside the houses

Our party of four devoured three pizzas in mere minutes. Not because we were hungry, but the pizzas were amazing! We were most pleased with number 7 as it was just packed with flavours! We loved the pillowy crust and the simple toppings. Service was impeccable too. A really good meal spot, set in a quiet neighborhood.

Had a few pizzas here and they specialize in good sourdough pizzas. Personally i prefer my thin crust regular pizzas. (To each his own) Sourdough is great with eggs and salmon for breakfast or as a really good sandwich for brunch. Salads were great but a little dissapointed at the full plate portion. Was not enough for one person

Love their pizzas. The difference is their dough which is made from Sourdough, hence their name "PLANK SOURDOUGH PIZZA". Was there with my kid so chose no 0 which is the Kid Pizza (aka pepperoni pizza). Tried some others but the kid pizza still the favourite with or without the kids

Had several pizzas and salad here as a family. All excellent and service was good except the smoked salmon and prawn one. Prawns were small, frozen and tasteless and added nothing to the pizza - actually made it not nice. They'd be better not putting them on at all if they're not going to use fresh ones.

This pizza restaurant, which adjoins the Baker & Cook cafÃ© at Swan Lake Avenue, is a bus/taxi journey out of the centre of Singapore, but is well worth the distance. This was our second experience and it did not disappoint; the pizza was fantastic. A super sourdough base and a generous and delicious topping of parma ham and rocket accompanied by a daily special salad and a glass each of house red for $51.50. All served by friendly and welcoming staff. Can't wait for another return visit

Plank is a place that you can go to after a hard day's work and chill over some good food and company. The setting is simple and unpretentious. The pizza and the garlic bread are awesome. The desert counter (under BAKER AND COOK) makes the visit complete. The staffs are attentive and friendly. One of the best kept secrets in Opera Estate.

We were welcomed by the very friendly staff. You can sit indoors and outdoors and the place has a nice charm to it. Also in a quiet neigbourhood, really nice. The appetizers crostinos with dips are great, even a bit too big a portion to share with two if you both have a main course afterwards. Some minor points though. Our red wine was too warm. The pizza's -and remember this is a pizza place where you can basically choose between 6-7-8 pizza's or so- were not great. The bottom part was too tick and not crunchy enough. It lay on our stomachs during the entire night even after we had decided to eat only the toppings of the last part. Hmmmm.... if you really want to run a pizza place, then you'd better make sure your pizza's are top notch. They aren't, there are much better pizza places in Singapore sorry to say. Looking at the guys who were preparing the pizza's before they went into the oven and how one of them was behaving like an amateur the entire time (the one with the glasses) I'd say this might have something to do with it, but obviously this is just my guess. Anyway, a nice neighbourhood but not going to go there again for pizza and as that's the only main course you can eat there, that'll be it. Baker & Cook next door though, I'll be going there a lot more
