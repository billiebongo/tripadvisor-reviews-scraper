Intimate and basic.. a must try .. Wagyu and pork grill with simple yet flavorful soups and a good Soju to wash it down :)

I ordered Pork as a starter and Wagyu sirloin for my main course. The quality of the wagyu is very good and the wine is also decent. My meal was expensive and the restaurant was quite noisy. My main course arrived before my starter and the waitress gave me my bill before I had asked for it. Yazawa is a good resturant when it comes to the food however the service is questionable.

The food is fine but it was very bad service, the staffs were so impolite. We (group of 11) book 6.30pm and came 15' early, made lots of food order. After 1 hour they asked us to finish the meal at 8pm. OMG, when we complain that we still have a lot of food to finish in just 30', the very short hair waitress shouted at us, and did not let us say any word! OMG it was such an unimaginable situation! The bill was 1141

A great Yakiniku restaurant. Very good air extractor system so it is not as smoky as some other places I've visited. Service level was very friendly and the range of beef was very good. I would recommend the tenderloin, whilst expensive, it is melt in the mouth quality. Location is ideal as there are multiple spots for both pre and post dinner drink
5
We spent a delightful evening, the food was great.The different types of beef are of such good quality.The waitress was very helpful explaining the menu so we choose well.Even the saldas and the vegetables.We spent almost $400 per person which is a lot in Singapore but well spent. We'll be back
5
We frequent this joint every month. Consistent. Good price and the grill station is fantastic . Please try their curry rice with and egg and for the more adventurous try the raw beef rice. Only the freshest and the skilled Chef can create this delicious dish . Approximately 60 sgd per head

Came here several times with my girlfriend who's a regular. We ordered 4 to 5 different types of beef including gyu tongue which was more chewy in texture. I love the white beef broth, the aroma was good! They serve authentic Japanese rice cooked just right. I also enjoyed the kimchi cabbage. It's usually crowded so reservations are necessary. This restaurant is pricey, our dinner for 3 usually costs about $300 - $350

One of the best yakiniku places I've been to is Japanese BBQ Yakiniku Yazawa in Unity Street. Probably the best in Singapore. The meat selection is TOP class wagyu beef. You can see from the marbling in all the slices they serve. You only need to grill it for a short period, then enjoy the soft tenderness of the beef. We had different slices of beef; it's hard to remember which part is which, but after the tongue slices, it was all good. We paired the meat with Suntory nama beer, followed by Italian red wine. Great combination!For starters, the veggies and kimchi provided a good preparation for the heavy eating that was to follow. The ambience is noteworthy, too. The place is warm and service-oriented. Even the lighting is easy on the eyes. Just a dozen or so tables with 4-6 pax each, for a more personalised dining experience. Service is A1, as well. The grill is replaced often, as soon as black soot forms on it. The waitress is always on hand to take orders. Price is high, though. So prepare your wallet before you book for dinner. But you get quality dining in return. Will come back with my family.

Probably the best Yakiniku place in Singapore, if not south east Asia. The beef quality is amazing with A5 marbling in all cuts. My favorite is Rib Shin, a very thin beautifully marbled slice from which you can feel the melt-in-your-mouth tenderness while still getting the meaty taste. Price is quite high but it's justified by the beef quality.
4
Dinner for 2 If your into Yakiniku, you will love this place. The meats offered here are really top notch, just note that quality doesn't come cheap.The restaurant isn't too smokey and there's is a pretty good drinks menu available. We had a nice bottle of sake.Definitely worth a visit
5
The beef served is indeed tasty and the price is reasonable. It is not easy to find such quality of Japanese beef even in Japan.
The tast is second to none.
4
Yazawa has good yakiniku with much of the meat imported from Japan. Try the chateaubriand if you are there. However, the restaurant could improve its service a bit.
5
Hands down, one of the best yakiniku place i have ever tried. Even my daughter enjoyed it especially the tongues. Top quality beef without question. Despite the busy hour,service surprisingly quite quick. Just order away, you wont get wrong
4
Services was very very very Slow, because it was packed. Expected less slow service regarding the hectic hours.
Food quality is good
5
This is the best Japanese BBQ restaurant I've tried in Singapore so far. A, classy, intimate and comfortable setting, impeccable service and fantastic food. Dinner for two cost about 200SGD, so reasonably priced, though you could spend more.
5
The quality of food was absolutely excellent.
We order very simply: the house salad, rice, and a few different cuts of the beef including the tongue.
Overall excellent food and in terms of prices, on par with what you would expect to pay in Singapore.
5
They have wagyu beef imported directly from japan. The grade is A5 which is the marble quality is the best. It's recommended when you are looking for yakiniku in Singapore.

Yazawa used to be my favourite restaurant as I went there at least once or twice a week. I love Japanese beef and the dark lighting inside Yazawa is nice for a yakiniku place. However, ever since 2 years ago, they became so popular, they are always rushing people out so they can pack in guests for next seating. My husband got so frustrated that we decided to stop going there for a year. Recently, we thought we will give them a 2nd chance, but again on the phone, they tell u they need table back at certain time (barely 90minutes) and they were chasing us by collecting stuff loudly within an hour so we can leave.It is so stressful to eat there being rushed especially when we have not even finished our wines and were thinking of ordering 2nd rounds. The management clearly doesn't believe in serving clients like us and just want to pack 3 rounds of diners as much as they can and so treats the client's like they were just there for fast-food! Sad really
5
Great taste, best quality of meats.. Love the Yazawa salad.. But poor service.We had appetizers and salad done and the main course came not longer after the appetizers. We felt like want to add some more beef cause it taste so good..the beef is melt in your mouth. So we ordered some more.. But we have to wait quite long for the adds on food.. Until we felt doesn't want to eat anymore.. Maybe because the restaurant was busy at that time, (it's Friday night by the way) so they couldn't manage the guests well.. I hope they can fix this problem in the future. â˜º

After seeing many good reviews online, I went to try Yazawa. They only open for dinner, so please reserve in advanced. When I placed my reservation (through a phone call) the waitress was a bit rude. When we got to the restaurant, it was in full swing. They have extensive menu of Australian Wagyu and Yazawa Beef Wagyu imported directly from Japan. Their Yazawa beef: THE BEST. Ordered Gyu-tan & Australian karubi, along with 2 portions of Yazawa Beef. Throughout the meal, they changed our bbq grill 2x so the meat does not stick. Overall it was a great dinner, beef were amazing! Quite pricey, but def worth it
5
This are one of best yakiniku, they serve Japanese Wagyu directly flown from Japan, the taste is so tender, juicy and very sweat. This is place is very highly recomanded to take a dinner. Hope can go there again
5
Excellent quality meat. Small place, and really expensive but worth it for Yakiniku lovers like myself. Must book in advance.
5
Beef Heaven. Enough said. Well not enough actually im supposed to write 100 words. So here goes BEEF HEAVEN BEEF HEAVEN BEEF HEAVEN BEEF HEAVEN BEEF HEAVEN BEEF HEAVEN BEEF HEAVEN. This place is so friggin good!
4
It's a must "go & eat" restaurant for my son each time he is in Singapore even though he lives in Japan. I personally think here is the place where you can get the best Wagyu beef. Therefore they pricey and yet worthy.
5
the beef were so amazing. i opt for the fattiest cut and they are simply the best ever.! pricey but worth it.however i have some weird experience with them, so i booked my table at Yazawa, but when i got ther they said that they're full blablabla, so they made me seat at Masa (just next door) they said that they are under the same management and that the meat i ordered will come from Yazawa, i wonder tho if it's common or not?but still i believed that the meat is served from Yazawa, Best Japanese BBQ ever
4
The quality of the meat is superb. Try the beef tongue and tontoro for something more chewy. The Australian wagyu has more bite than the Japanese wagyu. I'd go with the Australian first then the melt in your mouth Japanese. The side dishes are excellent. I especially enjoy the cod fish innard even though I normally hate any kind of innards. The porkbelly side dish that wasn't on the menu was also excellent. Overall a satisfying experience.
5
sat night reservations are a must for this place. i heard a lot of walk ins turned away even with their 2nd round reservations .service is 7.9/10 , when as a waiter you dont know where the beef that is served comes from, other wise, the constant changing of the hot grill was pleasantly nice. the food especially the beef are a notch up from everywhere , even tho i had to do it myself .that does tell you how good the beef is .do order the leek salad , goes very well with the beef .intimate settings but u dun go away smelling of cooked meat so a very nice experience 
4
This is a lovely little restaurant that oozes charm and is extremely cozy and, if you wanted, intimate too. It is limited in size so if you want to secure a table, best book ahead of time.It's a unique form of dining where the speciality of the house is an in-table barbecue. About a third of the men are the meat options you have for this barbecue style dining but beware!!! Your don't get much for your money so it can become VERY expensive VERY quickly. My advice - choose one item for barbeque and then enjoy some of the starters which are very nice and decent value for money
4
There are some Japanese style Yakiniku (Table BBQ) restaurant in Singapore and this is probably the most famous (and most expensive) one. Most of the beef are air-flown from Japan while they use some Australian Wagyu as well. The quality of the beef are great. But other dishes are not so impressive. Service is casual, like most of the restaurants in Singapore, but I expect a bit more when paying S$200 per pax
5
A few years ago we went to Japan & fall in love with the Japanese beef Yakiniku. When we came back to Singapore, our friend told us that a Yakiniku restaurant is going to open. We were excited & we're looking forward to it. Well needlessly to say, the rest is history. We come here often for very very good Kobe beef. They are always fresh, tender, succulent, tantalizing..
5
Cant get enough of the meat served here. The quality of the meat only matched by the best restaurant in japan.
5
Every single time I'm in Singapore, I would always drop by at Yazawa for the best Japanese BBQ in town. Never disappoints. The ox tongue, the rib eye and the kurobuta pork is to die for.
5
Carnivore heaven. Found this restaurant by accident across the street from hotel where we were staying. Finest cuts of meat from Australia and Japan. The later twice as expensive but worth every cent. Expensive, but a truly unique and delicious experience.
5
The best yakiniku we've ever tried. Love the quick service. Great quality of meat.
And we are going back there this month. Excellent.
5
Came here based on the TA reviews and we weren't disappointed. We didn't book so when we walked in they said they need the table back in 1 hour and 45 mins into the meal they did tell us last order which whilst a little annoying was fair since we agreed to leave after the hour which by the way was enough time. We had two porks ad the mixed veg to cook which were delicious. The pork was amazing. We also had two beefs one for around S$58 the other for around 40 and to be honest the cheaper option was nicer. The more expensive option was more marbled of course but was not as tasty. Expect to pay around 100-120 sing a head. Would definitely come again and would recommend ordering pork and beef and try the less marbled (which means cheaper) cut
5
Yakiniku Yazawa is quite expensive for dinning but quality of beef is the best ever.Been there with my boss and got a private room.Staffs were very friendly and service was excellent.Please do reservation in advance as always house full especially on weekend dinner.Spent 500+ for 3 person
4
I would recommend to talk with the staff to let them show you the cut style at Yazawa. I am lucky get Judy the manager to take care of us.The dinner is very delicious. And the price value is reasonable. Only that you cant try the sake, so probably try the craft so find out what you like
5
Four of us arrived at Yakiniku Yazawa at 5:55 pm for a 6 pm reservation, and we were given a booth with green squares of glass above the wood, giving a sense of privacy. We had several cuts of beef for barbecuing: rump, rib eye, brisket, pork, and tenderloin. The tenderloin was sweet and tender, and it went well with the Japanese rice. We had vanilla pudding and caramel pudding for dessert. The service, atmosphere, and the food were excellent. We can understand why Yakiniku Yazawa is so often booked up and it is difficult to get a table if you just walk in. The culinary experience is well worth the trouble of making a reservation
5
This probably the best yakiniku beef in Singapore. Need to make reservations and place always crowded. Some time the best cut beef are not available so be prepare. The zabuton cut beef is excellent, the chateaubriand is also good, I love them all. Try the curry rice with wagyu, and the raw beef, it's delicious
5
The best yakiniku experience we've had outside of Tokyo. Yazawa has a good selection of meats which are flown directly from Japan. While they boast of their wagyu the restaurant also serves pork and chicken. We ordered only beef for our dinner and tried them both marinated and non-marinated. We decided the meat was so tender, fresh and thinly sliced that marination didn't do the meat justice. Prices are on the high side but worth the quality. Be prepared to part with $120-$150 per pax for dinner. I'd recommend Yazawa for meat lovers and special occasions. Can't wait for our next visit
5
the best yakiniku i ever had. very fresh n juicy. tried the yukke and it was great. the ox tongue, the sirloin are the best for me and my wife
5
one of the top yakiniku places in Singapore by far, just be prepared to spend about $140++ a person not including alcohol.
4
Good service, quality meat. Opens only for dinner. The only hope was I wish they have variety of meat choice - Japanese A5.
5
For the best beef in Singapore, Yazawa is it. All the different cuts of beef were so tender, they melt in your mouth. It is pricey but so are all Yakinuku restaurants. At this restaurant, you will be getting what you are paying for.
5
Yazawa beef that melts in your mouth.. it's tender and juicy and they have the best yakiniku in singapore, service is five star.
4
The star of this restaurant is simply their meat, its simply mind blowing. The meat is melt in your mouth.We order 6 types (kalbi, shin2, misuji, tomo, kata-kaburi, and nakaniku. Planning to order the tongue and Sirloin but they run out of both, since we come quite late) of cuts and each cut is all equally good, but my favorite is the Kalbi. This goodness also come with price, but for the quality that the meat offer, for once in a while I think its okay to treat yourself with some good quality meat.The service however is averag
4
Had our anniversary dinner. This place has one of the better quality meat wagyu in Singapore. Expect to pay a bit higher but still worth it. Recommended dishes are the YUKE raw meat, can't go wrong with any meat but order a side dish of leek salad and Sanchu. As wrap the meat around the leek salad and Sanchu.
4
Crowded, busy and authentic would largely characterize this Japanese meat palace. The finest of beef and pork, thinly sliced or cubed, are brought to the grill in the center of the table, cooked in place and served while still sizzling. The companion rice and salad are perfectly prepared and delicious
5
We have eaten here a few times. My children love the meat. Not cheap but the quality of the meat is very high and significantly better than other places we have tried in Singapore for not much more. Booking is a little weird, with strict time limits but no problem once you know what it is. Our favorite BBQ shop here
5
Tender beef, authentic side dishes and curry rice. You will enjoy the entire dinner. The last minutes reservation could be difficult. Try to book few days in advance. It could be seating timing fm 6pm to 8pm, 8:30 pm till close.Majority of the customer is Japanese. What else do you need to know how good it is ?
4
A very popular place so reservations are definitely required. Great choice of different cuts of wagyu which you grill yourself. Not cheap, but worth a visit for special occasions.
5
Authentic Japanese Cuisine Yakiniku Yazawa specialises in different cuts of beef. They serves amazing high quality Wagyu beef from Japan & Australia with side dishes combination. Fresh and melt in your mouth meats. The prices aren't cheap, be prepared to pay minimum SGD100 - SGD200 per person. Service was also top notch, it's probably my favorite Yakiniku place in Singapore. This restaurant (Japanese BBQ Yakiniku Yazawa) located in 11 Unity Street #01-01 Robertson Walk Singapore 237995 and Tel. 6235 294

My gf brought me here for a treat after she got her first paycheck. She did a booking for 730pm but when we arrive at 720pm. We had to wait about 15 minutes before we were seated. The menu was given to us upon being seated, but to us, we hardly are any sort of beef expert, so we decided to ask the waitress to give us some recommendation. Was suprised for a high class restaurant, she did not speak good english and was hardly any help in helping us decide what to order and enlightening us on the serving portion.In the end, we ordered some raw beef appetizer with egg, beef tongue, 4 variety of different beef cut and a bowl of rice soup. To start it off, the raw beef appetizer was definitely unique, the first few mouthful was quite tasty, but after a few more mouthful, i felt it was better to cook it over the stove for easier digestion. The beef tongue was not at all nice, so maybe skip it. There's probably a reason why people in Singapore do not really eat it.The different meat cuts look different and taste different. I can't really comment on what to order, but normally the more expensive one would be cut in thinner slices and better melts into your mouth. The rice soup that i ordered (thinking it was something unique), tasted horrible. Had to force myself to finish it considering it was quite an expensive bowl.Overall, food was fresh, variety limited, atmosphere quite well thought of, but staff attitude negative. What I didn't like about the service was that they gave us the impression that they wanted us to pay and faster leave so that they can give the seat up to other customers who were waiting. They came at least 3 times to my table during my meal to ask us if we wanted to buy more food if not we should settle the bill and the truth was, we spent less than 45 minutes at that place. Overall, my bill came out to about $250 including gst and service charge. Pretty expensive meal and I really think I would not be hurrying back here anytime soon. But do check the place out yourself if you do not mind paying high price for air-flown fresh food
4
Lots of lovely food and plenty of meat not so much veg, but great tastes melt in the mouth, we were on the earlier seating and wish had been able to get an late one. The place is obviously popular there wasn't an empty seat and it was the middle of the week
5
Extremely tasty yakiniku. I've had lots of yakiniku in Japan and elsewhere... this place is top rank. About same as jojoen in Japan. You'll pay for it too, as expected... Seats are nice and cosy. The meat is out of this world. Sorry to use such a corny expression...The "yazawa" salad was nice too.They have a bizarre reservation system. Called for reservation, asked for 7 pm. I was told they have only 2-hour time slots, on the hour. Can have 6-8, 7-9, 8-10, etc. No 7-9 slots available. They said I could make a 6-8 reservation, and come at 6:30, but would have to leave by 8. Huh? Anyway odd reservation system aside, the food is fantastic. See pics
4
This was one of many near the hotel and just across the street. I'd not had Japanese BBQ before, having helped inaugurate the 'Grill-style' from back in the 60's, so this was a new treat. Loved the very tender Wagyu (sp?) as it was a good reminder of the former Kobe beef I remember
5
I heart you Yazawa :)Especially the food! My favorite is of course the meat, oh those lovely high quality meats (misuji and zabuton hold a very special place in my heart) that literally melt in your mouth.But I have another winners, first is the radish kimchi that has become a staple for me and second the lovely Yukhoe. I normally dont eat raw beef (I dont like beef tartare), and I especially hate raw egg yolk. But Yukhoe is an exception, because it tastes wonderful, the fresh raw minced beef is sweet and crunchy, the egg yolk is helping the flavour to come out.The atmosphere is nice and the service is very good.Yazawa only opens for dinner and you have to make reservation, because it's usually full.All and all, everytime I come to Singapore I'd make an excuse to eat here, although the only setback is the steep price
5
this restaurant has so much character, dined here with a couple of friends and had a great time. the food was sublime, the oxtail soup and the beef is as good as anywhere in Singapore. Nice selection of sake as well, good reasonable prices. Only thing is that you walk out of the restaurant smelling like smoke&bbq. One of my favourites in SG
5
Dining with my old pal Peter, who is himself a favourite chef of mine whenever he offers to be one at his own home is never to be missed, and on this short conference trip of mine to Asia he had booked at Yazawa.It is a inconspicuous looking restaurant with its own entrance onto Robertson Walk and on entry seems like a friendly enough and informal Japanese eatery. P ordered for us to share from an array of meats encompassing kidney, pork and many others, but the "piece de resistance" that evening was certainly the cut of fatty sirloin. All the various cuts tasted perfect after a brief grilling on the centrepiece heating element which is in-built to all the tables here. But back to the amazing sirloin, which I am not entirely sure was purely just its quality or due also to P's experienced and what looked to be quite meticulous searing, was exquisite to no end. It was succulent, tender and all things to one yearning for the perfect meat cut.We also finished off an almost meat only menu with cold noodles which complemented the evening rather well.All in all a great evening though the bill does come in rather hefty here, and takes into account fully that the different cuts have been sourced from the best
5
love the gizzard and pork belly stick the most! of course others also as delicious as expected. they have rice bowls and complete japanese dishes, but i always just come for the sticks and sakes and some chill cold japanese beers! definitely must to try. to the management; need to open at least till midnite, 10.30 for last order made us bit sad.. and 11 pm all is disappear.. maybe till midnite hours on weekend ? that wud be perfect
