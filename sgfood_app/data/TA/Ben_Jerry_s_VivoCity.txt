They have some unique flavors to try, and they come in good portion,good taste,walking by the harbor with an ice cream- time well spent

tried quite a few flavours. Salted caramel, Chocolate brownie, One strawberry one and all were good. They had a offer on in which you pay for a small size and get a med size cup!

The best ice cream experience in a very long time
This is exactly what we needed after walking and touring for a while in Universal Studios
Must visit for every ice-cream lover
Cleanliness of the place could have been better

We ordered a New york Fudge icecream in waffle cone. Each layer had a new surprise. there was cream, nougat chocolate - heavenly.....absolute must eat. Its pure bliss in the hot and humid weather of Singapore

Whilst the ice cream was good quality and tasty, this could possibly be the most overpriced ice cream I have ever eaten.
I would only visit here if you are desperate for ice cream.

Pity there was no free plain water there. Most places selling ice-cream will have this. The ice-cream was decent, nothing really to rave about. Extremely sweet, which my kids didn't like.

So far this is the best ice cream in Singapore that you can have in Singapore. The taste is so good , hard to beat , lot of flavor selection. Miss those superb White Russia flavor

My daughter wanted to stop in here for a ice cream last week and she loved it.
I did let her grab the extra large waffle cone with the chocolate top edge and 2 scoops of ice cream but $11.90 is a bit to much.

Decided to pop over for dessert after lunch. Ordered Life's a Beach smoothie ($11.90 for small). Smoothie was yummy and smooth unlike some places where they added ice not blended well and hence you can actually "taste the crushed ice". Place was nice and clean. The staff serving me was very friendly. She was also knowledgeable on the types of ice cream and didn't appear frustrated when I asked to try a few different flavours. Would have given it 5 stars except for the price. But I have gone to a few ice cream and dessert stores recently and noticed that the prices of desserts are actually very expensive (e.g. Korean bingsu > $20, waffles and ice cream > $18, etc). These prices can actually get me 2 main meals in a food court or hawker centers...hmm...
