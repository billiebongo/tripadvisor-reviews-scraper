Tawadang Dempsey Road is highly accessible with lots of free parking space around. We were entertained by a Thai live band, with some nice songs.
5
Food and ambience was good. However, service could be made more efficient since the restaurant wasnâ€™t full with patrons. Some mosquito controls required for outdoor sitting.
3
Service was really slow and uninterested. More interested in their smartphones. Lager beer tasted sour -- probably beer taps not cleaned properly. Dark beer was good. Food was pretty good, but certainly not cheap.
4
Good night enjoy with my friends. Tom Yam, green curry and pork knuckles are still good. Portion is still a bit small with such a price. But the performance add on the experience as well. Most of all, the beer is good~
4
The atmosphere was truly a Thai type microbrewery. Food quality is consistent abide a bit overpriced. The live band was good and should have more Thai numbers instead of catering to the local audience. Service wise is so so but if you are craving for a solid Tomyam goong and freshly brewed beer, this will be my goto place
3
The food (especially the pork knuckles) and live band performance were awesome. However, the waiters need to be trained better. They decided to use the empty table next to ours as a 'dish station', putting all the used utensils and food trash there while we were eating and celebrating anniversaries. Big no-no :( We mentioned about it in a nice way, but the waiters gave us a confused look, as if our request was illogical. Sigh.
1
The waitress whom served us for a lovely lady. I certainly have no complains about her. However, it was the rude and obnoxious attitude of the server whom directed us to our table. My husband did not see her when she showed us to our table. In order to get our attention, she slammed the menu loudly on the table. Secondly, when we asked for a refill of hot water, the same waitress whom showed us to our table came over with a cup of hot water. When my friend told her that we wanted the tea pot to be refilled with hot water, she sighed with disgust and turned away. She didn't even wait for my friend to explained to her that he told the other male waiter to fill in the tea pot. She simply turned and walked away with the pot in hand, while my friend was trying to provide her with an explanation. This waitress certainly brought down the morale and kind attention of her team.

Came for Sat lunch, 95% empty. Tom Yam was super spicy which is great if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re that way inclined, and the Thai basil pork rice was above average. Pad Thai so so. Gut tells me I need to come back for beers, the live band setup looks kinda sick and I can imagine it would be great atmosphere with a crowd

Used to be a nice and good place to hangout, but apparently at low peak period, u might wanna avoid this place totally. 1) Servers don't know what to recommend on the new menu, they no idea what it tastes like and don't eat thai food??? I mean why hire ppl that don't even like ur product? Servers are also more interested in their phones than taking the bill. Wanted to walk away without paying after multiple attempts just to get the bill. 2) Food portion is smaller and prices have increased. Only redeeming factor is the beer. Would probably never come back to this place. So much more better options within walking distance.
5
We have been there as a couple and we enjoy the food and atmosphere. This time, we bring the family and friends back as a big group. The service is attentive and people are nice to the young kids. We also enjoy the singing/show later in the evening.
5
The food was good and very authentic. The band starts playing at 7.30pm. We enjoyed it a lot. Will definately go back again.
5
Excellent service. All the staff were attentive and shows polite manner. We love the band playing, awesomeðŸŽ¶. We really had a wonderful night. Its a very good place to go and chill. Im so glad we came to this restaurant.
2
The location is great (we recommend a table on the terrace as the restaurant uses too much air conditioning) . The beer is delicious. The food is ok, but not outstanding. Unfortunately, the service and staff are very disappointing.
5
This is a very nice place. They have amazing live band and Germany beer to accompany you through the night while enjoying the music.
5
The beers are pretty good here, the service is excellent and I loved the Thai food; don't get talked into 'Thai hot' though ;-) All really good and definitely a recommend...
4
A Unique combination of thai and german food that makes it so delicious. Loving the pork knuckle because it is served with thai sour chilie sauce. The tom yum soup and fish cake are also excellent.
1
Arrive at the restaurant at 3.30pm, ordered a Happy hour one for one beer promo and specifically asked the waiter if I can redeem the pork knuckle voucher from Fave too and his reply was ok no issue. After I have redeemed the voucher about 5 mins later they came back to me and told us unable to redeem the voucher only to come back another day and mention my name. Due to the Poor customer service throughout the time, I have decided I will not be returning and will cancel my voucher and inform the service manager. The manager name AOF now tells me they can do a take away for me and ask me to wait as I was about to leave the place. After 10 mins of wait, he came back to me and mention again they are unable to honor the voucher after been redeem today. So why waste my time once again if your service staff is at fault again? I will not be returning anytime soon again
4
I haven't tried them all, but this beer was really lovely. Ice cold, fresh and very tasty. Cannot say anything about the food or the music since we only had drinks here. The location is very nice with outdoor seating and the service is good too
4
I was there with a business partner last evening. The beer is chilled and fresh, the food is tasty and I like the fresh oysters. I enjoyed the live band and very attentive service. Price is slightly on the high side. Well, it is still an awesome place to dine
5
The restaurant is located in Dempsey, one of the first few restaurants when you drive in. Parking is easy just outside the restaurant.The atmosphere is nice though it could use a little renovation to freshen up.The first thing one notices upon entering is the band. Tawandang always has a large band and the standard is always very high. They play all kinds of music from various languages such as English, Chinese and Thai.One must try the beer at this place. Over the years, I believe they have improved on their brew. It is now a fine brew which is smooth and tasty. Please try their German pork knuckle, I must say they are one of the best in Singapore especially when dipped in their Thai sweet chili sauce.The Tom Yum is also good while something a little more exotic would be their Blood Cockles. They are washed very clean and either boiled or baked.The dinner left us very satisfied and well entertained.Do go during happy hours as they are 1 for 1 then
5
Visited there with a group of colleagues and it was a great experience. There was a live band playing and the beer was very good. Being a vegetarian, they made some special dishes for me and those very very good. Worth a visit!
1
Staff needs some professional training though the food was ok. I would call it high priced, ill managed Restaurant.
4
We visited this place for beers- thai /German beers caught our attention. The beers were good and comparable to the more popular German equivalents. We enjoyed our time.
4
I have been looking for a authentic Thai restaurant and this come close, including the noisy thai band. They were enjoying themselves even when the audience were not very responsive, mostly concentrating on their food.
3
We went there on the pork knuckle voucher deal and the pork knuckle was ok. For my wife and I it was a mistake to have it deep fried, way too unhealthy and tasted very oily, but that's more our fault. I wouldn't pay full retail at $36 ++.We ordered a pad Thai to go with it and this was ok, not the best, not the worst but certainly not the most authentic. The real kicker was the price of drinks, $5++ for a can of soft drink, $12++ for a 300ml beer, just ridiculous.There is plenty of room, inside and out and the ambience is great (we left for the band started). It's a nice setting. Some of the dishes that were brought out to other tables looked very appetising, but if I had to be honest, it's fine dining prices and I don't think the value is there.Staff were responsive and reasonably friendly
4
Although the food is quite nice, what I find really nice was that the staff will keep coming back with cold chilled beer mugs and continue to keep our beer cold. Band was nice but if you want to talk, best to stay away from the stage or sit outside
5
This is a perfect blend of Thai and German restaurant. Long tables in the hall , good beer and great Thai food. Service was really impeccable There is a nice touch, by using a call button linked to a waiters watch watch. Help is always close by, and it takes away the annoying question from a waiter that comes at the most inopportune time . Great food selection as thai as thai can be outside of Thailand.Likely you will need a taxi to get there. If you drive there is plenty of parking Strongly recommend. Enjoy

Came to Dempsey Hill and found this spot ... Beer was very cold and we tried the local brews .... Good was good and we all ordered a range to sample ... Would we return mmmm not sure !!!! But a one off was good ...
4
Tuck away in one corner of Dempsey Place, Tawandang serves spine chilling cold beer that's brewed in small quantity & quality. The food is fantastic if you like cockles! Served just the right way, not too bloody n super tender and you are spoiled with different dips! The papaya salad can be of different level of spiciness. We did not try the steam boat but it sure looks good across the table. There are many signature dishes by the Thai chef but we were too full to try any. The beer n cockles are good enough for us. There is also a live band but I'm not too impress with the singing. Will definitely go back to try the rest of the food.
4
If you are out shopping on Dempsey Road and you want to have lunch there. The beers are all made in house and the Weitzen was excellent with the taste of clove just like in Frankfurt. The Food was suburb but the portions were small. The Minced Pork with Thai Herbs was delicious and they make it as spicy as you want. The mango salad with shrimp was also delicious and the prices are very reasonable. Worth a visi
4
For a not too heavy meal we went to this Thai restaurant. Very Nice dishes with a Great variety. reasonable prices. Have a local beer with Your meal.
5
Great band too. Excellent Beer!
Authentic Thai Food. It's not a place to be formal. .. Wear your shorts or office wear... and relax!
4
We went there during eatigo promotion of 40% off and very worth the visit. Great food and atmosphere and must try their in-house brew beer. Check the menu price before order as Claypot crab with tanghoon cost a bomb.
3
When you need to take a late lunch and looking for a quiet place for food and beer, I suggest this place. Nothing to shout about. Happy hour beer is reasonable, after that it becomes difficult because they get busy and later when they have stage performance, it becomes impossible. Try it. Modified Thai food
4
Honestly, food is edible, but far from great. Price is also not a draw, since we all know how cheap it can be in Thailand. Also, Tawandang in Thailand (bangkok, and several other provinces) have a much more happening crowd. Certain times, even big name artistes perform at Tawandang. In Singapore, everything is scaled down, even the closing hours. The band sings English songs, which really kills the 'thai' factor. Then again, the locals (and some expats) who visit Tawandang for a meal, may never have experienced the real Thai version before. So what the heck. The real converts do not come to Tawandang in Singapore.It's like Disneyland. You go to the one in US. Japan just don't make the cut, neither does HK
4
This is one of my favorites as the fried garoupa and steam squids are amongst the best in Singapore with the specialty sources. The signature pork knuckle. Is not as good as the tendons have been removed. Other traditional Thai desserts are keeping up with expectations. However compared to the parent outlet in BKK, the beer are too light. With the various craft beer outlets coming up in recent years in Singapore, it will need to improve its brew.
4
Went with a friend for lunch. We were the only guests there, nice and quiet and perfect if you want to talk and enjoy a peaceful environment. Service by our waitress Luck was very very friendly, quick and efficient. Food was nice and tasty and very reasonably priced. Can't comment on the atmosphere in the evenings, but heard it gets quite busy. Can recommend for a lazy lunch, nice to sit outside
1
We used to come to Tawandang 6 years ago and enjoyed a lot the food and the live band on weekends. It was not cheap but food was great and service was nice.We came back last Friday evening for what we thought would be a nice dinner out with my husband... and it turned out to be a complete disaster. We are found of Thailand and travel there every month... not to say that we only know what Thai food is but we know how to recognise HORRIBLE food, from all over the world. We chose the Tom Yum Soup, some asparagus with scallops ("chef" recommendation) and a grilled beef with "spicy Thai Sauce". All meals coming at 25 to 30 dollars each. The Tom Yum and Asparagus with scallops were served 5 minutes later... which says long about how freshly they had been cooked. The food was nothing close to Thai food. No taste (at the best) and disgusting at the worst. We then waited 30 minutes to get the beef... at least this one was freshly cooked we thought and ... OMG... the "THING" that was brought to our table was HORRIBLE: see the picture please !!! You would not believe it. The beef tasted like an old dog (not that I have ever tried but this is how I imagine it !!!!). The sauce was so sweeten and not spicy at all - never tasted this in 20 years of travelling across Thailand. And on the side of the beef: salad, cabbage, strawberries with MAYONNAISE ON TOP ??? This is when we called the waitress to mention that we would not eat this ... no name for it. She called the Manager in charge. We asked him if he was Thai. He confirmed he was from Isan so we asked "do you actually eat in this restaurant"? "yes, I do". "do you like it? because we believe food is very bad". He says "no, it is same like Isan, Thai style"... We confirmed we could not eat the beef and the strawberry with mayonnaise. He said "never mind, this is just the decoration". End of the conversation. We told him he could maybe delete the beef from our bill and brought back the bill with the full items including the beef on it !!! We sat there completely astonished by what happened: spending SGD160 (we tooke a beer and a bottle of wine) for a dinner that was so HORRIBLE with no service and no one to talk to about it. PLEASE DO RUN AWAY FROM THIS PLACE. There are so many delicious and HONEST restaurant in Singapore. Do not spend a penny nor 1 minute of your time on this one

Food was average but Thai milk tea was AMAZING! Thanks to the manager for helping us moved from outdoor(halfway we eating) to indoor seating because it's was too hot outside. Luck is great staff, even though she's not really well in speaking but she did her best to approach us in service

Simple thai cafe offering relaxing atmosphere and good beer. Menu selections quite ordinary, food quality average at above average prices. None the less, we enjoyed the atmosphere and music from the live band.
1
This collaboration does not work for me. Loud music, good beer and cheap Thai food.
Not my type of restaurant ...If it is a pub, it could be more successful.
3
We had dinner at this restaurant, we chose the outdoor area since the indoor area has cool AC and karaoke / live band with their sound was pretty loud, we need a little more peaceful to enjoy our dinner and can do the chit chat. the outdoor area is smoke free with the ceiling fans were freshen the areaThe food and the drink were great: the pork knuckle, the tom yum soup is sour and spicy but nice , the thai milk tea not too sweet, satisfied enough.The bad thing were the price was expensive , you spend almost 150S$ for the 3 person portion.So if you have extra budget to dine ,you can come to this place
1
Greeting at the door was prompt and friendly, and then the rest of the experience was bad.The menu is way overpriced, this is not a fine dining restaurant so expect standard pricing. Tables were only about one quarter full, so certainly not to crowded and demanding for kitchen or front of house. We only ordered 3 items, 2 came, 3rd item we asked them to check but they never came back to update us. We finally got sick of waiting, asked for the bill and told hem to remove the one item that didn't arrive (pad thai, which doesn't take that much time to cook). Waitress ran off to kitchen, never to get the item but by this time we wanted to pay and leave and go somewhere else for the balance of our meal. Waitress basically said it was our fault as we should have told them we wanted all items served together. ???Won't ever visit again
1
Different serversNo one knows your order. Waiter comes over and just stands there holding food and wouldn't put it down until another server came to do it.One main came quickly then another main 10 mins later then more mains and then the starters came in after that.Everything was out of sequence. Ridiculous.Live band covering pretty bad music.Not the best Thai food I've had either.Servings are small considering the price.Come to Singapore often enough, definitely won't be back here.Beer was decent.
4
Went with business associates there for the first time. It's close to town and parking is free, right in front of the restaurant...quite rare in Singapore. The beer selection is very good and so is the quality. The food selection is quite large and very nicely presented. Service was average, perhaps because we were seated outside on the terrace. Not sure if I'll be back unless someone else is paying
5
I booked my partner's 50th birthday here on a Friday night for a small gathering of 8 people and they served up great Thai food; it has a good busy vibe and all the drinks and food came out on time despite the crowd. They did seven birthdays that night so the staff are well versed in looking after birthday needs, from managing the cake (which we bought with us), to holding up a (purpose made) birthday banner behind the birthday person for photos to getting the band to sing happy birthday. The only criticism I have is that none of these simple but appreciated 'value-add' services were made known to me before the night, and it would be so easy to communicate it all. Anyway, I look forward to going again, great evening at a great place.
5
Been to to Tawandang in Singapore but I must say this outlet at BKK is totally different! We reached at 7.30 on a Tuesday night and the place was crowded but not full. By 8.30pm there were performances, dances etc and by 9.30pm we could see diners getting high and dancing. The staff were also very spontaneous and they performed 2 items with e singers as well. Toilets were also kept verrrry clean and dry. Overall, I'll definitely visit this place again when I'm back to BKK

The buffer from groupon sounds a deal too good to be true whatever you ordered the more you order the more you will top up on top of your buffet voucher price. I was horrified when i saw the manager adding it up.Buttt the food was really so good that i can only smile and pay the bill. We had so much of a hearty meal. The knuckle was so so but the tomyam soup and green curry was amazing. The taste was just nice not too spicy and not too sweet. Great crab meat fried rice very well seasoned wok taste can be tasted but a bit too salty. The red curry with thai paratha was the best for me simply love its spiciness but would love it if they added peanutsPay the bill seperately you will still end up paying more, great bar environment and spacious place. Will come again but certainly not liking the feeling of paying more when they did not stipulate thats how they tabulate the gst
3
This is one of the popular spots at Dempsey Hill. Depending on the time of the week, it could get crowded around meal times. There is band performance on weekend nights, and adds to the bar atmosphere. Beer is good from its microbrewery, and there is good selection of Thai food.
3
I went there after dinner very close, just to get a drinks with friend. Nice beer, vine and other coktails. Service excellent and very fast and professional. Nice time for a late night.
4
Built in the style of a German beerhaus it has a good selection of beers and is well situated on Dempsey Hill, great place to join mates and have a few different beers sitting in or outdoors, we were just there for beers so not sure on the food menu but it looks like it has a little bit of everything
4
We had grandma with us and although grandma speaks English, the Thai waitress was very enthusiastic to speak Mandarin. She was quick to offer us water - warm or cold water? This is very typical of Singaporeans preferring water to sugar drinks. We ordered beer, Thai coconut, lime juice, Thai ice tea and a cocktail drink. Green curry has always been our family's favorite Thai dish. This one was tasty but a tat sweet. Fried fish was skillfully sliced so it was presented without bones and was easy to eat. We made a mistake ordering the cockles. Cockles pair well with beer. But it was bloody and messy with steamed rice. Dessert was our main treat. There was a generous amount of coconut milk in the "ruby" dessert.There was a live band and the Thai musicians had a repertoire of songs for all ages, from a movie theme song for grandma to the "Frozen" Disney song for my kid.Nice place to have dinner but food was expensive
4
Very nice Thai Restaurant and excellent housebrewed beers.Located in a very quiet gardenlike neighbourhood away from the pulsating high streets.I visited with a friend for an early evening dinner.Excellent food and short waiting only. Menu card is traditional thai food and very delicious
3
On Dempsey Hill with a relaxed and informal setting, particularly nice outside on the terrace. Serves really good beer.Food is average in general. When we ate here last had some very good dishes (pomelo salad, chicken and cashew nuts, papaya salad) and some very average ones (green curry - watery, rice - hard, tofu soup - ok, nothing special). The dishes were not cheap, which considering the average quality, and the many alternatives - even hawker food locally, is surprising.A lot of the menu is quite a bit of fried food, which probably goes well with the beer but not great if you are not a big fan of oily food.Service was ok
5
~more than 12 years ago I was introduced to Tawandang in Bangkok and I'd make it a point to have dinner there every trip I make :) When they opened in Singapore it was an amazing infusion of Thai German transplanted to Singapore. This trip is the first time I visited after the change of local management.~first big change is the staff who'd always been Thai is now predominantly mainland Chinese, although the service does not lack for anything, the authentic Tawandang difference was missed~it was a hazy period but we bundled up the entire family for an evening out for dinner and were not disappointed... the food was the same as we'd been used to and just as delicious~Steamed Seabass YUMz we'd always order this first since it took a longer time to cook & waitstaff brought a 2nd bowl of soup for the dish which was a great plus~Thai Pomelo Salad an amazing tangy sweet hot tasty tasty dish :)~ Prawn Toast my boys polished off :)~Prawn Crispy Roll must be taken with both the slices of strawberry & pineapple YUMZ~Deep Fried Prawn Cakes a fabulous quick appetizers for kids :)~Boiled Pork with Lime Garlic is on the special menu and a very surprising dish that was loved by all :)~Fried Rice with Crab Meat we took the large one for my boys who must have their rice!~Fried Noodle with Chicken & Cuttlefish is one of my favorites we took 2 dishes of this for my older kids~Thai Grilled Beef is a very medium rare juicy sliced sweet dish that my 2nd son absolutely loves~Mango Sticky Rice this time with a twist of 3 different types of rice a super way to wrap up the evening YUMzAn incredibly consistent tasty & Yummy evening out with family, take a look at a few photos we took :

Located in Demsey Hill, Singapore's Tawandaeng is unlike other Tawandaengs you see in Thailand. It is more upscale and the patrons are less rowdy. Serves German and Thai dishes. Must try - Salt Grilled Fish! Also try their beer which is freshly brewed from their in-house microbrewery. Very nice beers! There is live music with the band singing mostly Thai or English songs. Price can be quite steep
3
Had 10 dishes ranging from Tom Yum soup to mango sticky rice. Different dish is fried crispy catfish which didn't look like fish at all and cuttlefish with sourish soup that's very tasty. Also had fresh young coconut juice. Dishes are good sized and very tasty. Fast service and didn't have times of long for dishes. Each person paid about $67 which is expensive for Thai food
2
Honesty, I've had so much better food in food court in Tangs mall, for 20% of the price. Greasy, heavy, poor presentation, we all fell like we ate a brick without finishing our food.Many people may come here for the beer as they get a litre free if they buy two litres, if that's your kind of fun, then that is the place to go. However, half a litre costs 15 SGD, so not exactly good value. Used to artesian microbreweries in Europe, I must say its nothing special at all. Service, very fast until they got our orders. My food arrived after about 5 minutes, my daughters probably 5 minutes later, my husband got his when we could be almost finished. Impossible to get any attention after food was served. Some music in the background which I assumed was karaoke appeared to be the artistic professionals. Altogether - so far the worst experience in Singapore. It also cost 20SGD to come here from centre of the city, so make sure that you chose a nicer spot in this otherwise lovely locatio
5
I have always enjoyed dining at this restaurant and have a regular since 2011. Since I am a vegetarian, there are very few thai places which serve authentic vegetarian thai food and this is one such place. The staff is always polite and they have a live band on almost all days. Its a great place for family gatherings and group outings. They have a unique way of celebrating birthdays ad well
5
Whenever I visited Singapore, I make it a point to go for a dinner to Tawandang, especial to eat their fried Pork and the Crab dish!
Every-time you go it has never changed and you will have the same taste.
Awesome food!
4
Visited several times in the evening and afternoon with my family. The food is great and the service is good (all are Thai).There is a micro brewery selling a few different brews, the beer is good.Can get a pricey but generally very nice.In the evening when we visited there was a Thai band playing Thai songs
4
I'm not sure if it is that hidden - it is rather big place, but - boy is the food amazing, as well as the beer. If Thai-German fusion sounds weird and maybe a bit frightening, don't worry. Just go there, enjoy yourself and eat and be merry! Go for the pork knuckle, which I would never had tried if a local didn't insist I give it a go. I did not regret it, not only was it huge, but it was amazing. Plenty of other dishes were amazing, I think our group of 4 had 6 or 7, which was way too much, but everything was perfect.Servie unpretentious and top notch.Love it
5
Tawandang in Dempsey is a perfect place to bring friends and family if you want real delicious home-cooked Thai food partnered with their very own different types of beer, brewed right there in their restaurant... every dish is amazing but to me, the highlight is their pork knuckle with their lager ...it is divine..the live band is a bonus...it adds energy and life in the restaurant. They are so friendly that they allow people, young or old, to sing up the stage...birthday celebrants are always greeted with a birthday song and is always given a special song. The whole atmosphere is wholesome that's why it is a great place to eat, drink and unwind..

Cost: $170 (4 Pax)Green curry chicken (3/5) - The curry is a tad too sweet for my liking. But the chicken is tender and nice! Not too spicy so it's a decent one for non-spicy food lover. Fried fish (3 sauce) (3.5/5) $35- Nothing special though, it's just a fried fish with sweet/tomato Taste sauce. Fish has lotsa meat! Non spicy dish. Papaya salad (3/5) - taste like any other papaya salad out there. Wouldn't order again if I am back. Fish cake (3/5) - it's a little soft and I hope it could have been crispier though. But it's a decent dish ! Mango sticky rice (4/5) $10- I liked this dish! They served a portion good for 4 to share after a heavy meal. Mango is sweet and rice is fragrant. The coconut dressing is salted so it tasty! Too pricey in my opinion though. Could have had it at a cheaper rate elsewhere. No bands on Tuesdays so it's kind of like any other regular restaurant.
4
the beers are good, but try the food too!Excellent choice of Thai specialties, rice, noodles, fish, chilli crab etc itwas a real sampling meal of nice and tasty dishes.Of course, this is Thai cuisine so you have to like spicy food. But spicy does not mean hot, but rather full of flavours not found in our Western culture.I cannot remember the name of all the dishes we tried, but if you are a fan you will enjoy this place, and if you are not yet fan of Thai food, run there
2
A lot of the menu was unavailable, even the mango sticky rice (?!?). Food probably mass-produced as we were served very fast - within 5 minutes. Sausages were good despite cold mashed potatoes. Took ages to get our table cleared. Beer was good. Overall, overpriced & disappointing
4
Very relaxed atmosphere with really good beer and fab Thai food... the fried sea bass was devoured in minutes and we didn't have anything that our party didn't like ;-)Really enjoyed it and will definitely be coming back... hopefully they won't sell out of wheat beer this time though ;-
2
This is the only place to get 2 pints for $15 in Dempsey, 1pm to 7pm. The food is just alright, it's expensive no doubt. $10 for simple prawn toast, French fries portion not really meant to share, the other main dishes are expensive for the portion presented. A great place to have beer cheaply, not really for food, and slight more points if only the staff can be more attentive.

I had dinner at Tawandang Microbrewery at Dempsey just to see how it compares to the one I visited at Rama in Bangkok. I went online 48 hours before to make a reservation. There was no confirmation email or SMS but you can print the acknowledgement before you close the browser. When I show up at the restaurant my reservation was noted in their reservation book. I also noticed that a lot of people made reservation. It was a Friday evening and most of the tables inside are taken at 8:30pm. It is not packed like BKK. The area is small compared to the ones in BKK. There are quite a lot of outside sitting as well but they are non-smoking.The menu is similar to BKK but the price is much more if you convert the currency. We ordered our favourites: spicy glass noodle ($16), deep fried duck tongue ($26), deep fried pork knuckle ($36), sautÃƒÂ©ed cabbage ($16), Thai papaya salad ($14). I had the Dunkel beer and my friend had the lager ($15 each for 0.5 litre) The taste is not as good as those in BKK. The spicy glass noodle and papaya salad is quite OK but the rest are not good. The pork knuckle is much small than the one we had in BKK and cost much more. The duck tongue is not as tasty. The bill comes up to $190 which is about THB4,600. The live band start performing at 7:30pm. There were 2 singer.. unlike in BKK where there were at least 10 singers taking turns performing. Even though I don't understand Thai I find the performance in BKK more entertaining.There were 2-3 servers that are Thai while I was there. When I left at 10pm there were still empty tables. I don't know if it's a slow Friday but in BKK it would have been packed. I guess I will visit Tawandang in Thailand

if you want Thai food with brewed beers... this is the place to be... Live Band is amazing
be here on late night for good entetainment
4
They have a nice live band performance and the thai food tastes good as well.Their beer is quite smooth and I like the beer taste
4
My second visit there and definitely will be going there again. Love the lively entertainment from the performance, sing, dance and love the Thai band. Fast serving of food and love the taste.
4
Been here three times. Food is consistently delicious and the service great. Locally brewed beer is cold and tasty. Have particularly enjoyed the Larb Gai and the sautÃ©ed Morning Glory. Haven't found a dish I didn't enjoy. Have never stayed around for the live entertainment.

We wanted a bit of a change so wandered around Dempsey Hill for inspiration. As the rains threatened we settled in the microbrewery as a best option and the Thai food sounded good. The food was pretty good - super spicy seafood salad, lovely green curry and pleasant river prawns with dry red curry. Best were the stir fried vegetables. The beer though was very disappointing - far too sweet for our palettes. Staff we friendly enough but a bit haphazard in service. Live music spoiled by too many karaoke interludes
3
We love Thai food & this place is one of our favourites. They have staff performance, live band, & the whole place is so lively. However, when we were here last weekend for dinner, we ordered our usuals but the food wasn't as good. The vege was undercooked too. The chicken wings were served cold!
5
Singing and Dancing, good music, good food, wonderful beer. i had a great time visiting this place. I've been to many a thai place and none are as upbeat, and spontaneous as this one. looks like the best of thailand is not the best of singapore.
4
By far one of the best restaurants that i have come across for Thai Vegetarian food.Lively atmosphere with live English music on weekend nights between 9 pm to 11pm- While the options for vegetarian selection are limited but one would still have at least a dozen options (put together between starters and main course) to choose.- The service is quite prompt and efficient.- My personal favourites are the Pineapple fried rice and tofu in sweet & sour sauce.- Love The Veg Tom Yum Soup and the veg corn cakes.Approx SGD20++/per person for vegetarian food(without drinks)in case you are looking for a vegetarian variant of a particular dish(Egs. Phad Thai Noodles or Tom Yum Soup) and do not find it in the menu, feel free to check with the staff and they are happy to serve.Located in Dempsey Hill Area-Singapore

When I entered this place last night, I thought, wow - Munich meets Thailand (or vice-versa). It really looks like the famed beer halls of Germany, just with Thai decorations. Live music (definitely loud), but singing pop hits and probably some amateur karaoke I am guessing. We had mussels, shrimp rolls, and garlic peanuts. Yes, a bit over priced and I was not blown away by the things we tried food wise. Beer was OK, but not outstanding. The dunkel was definitely the best, Hefeweizen second, lager was not too good. I think they got their yeast cultures crossed or fermented too warm. Regardless, I would guess that none of their beers are filtered - not a big deal to me. Overall, I give them a very good since they get high marks for innovation. Food was OK and beer was OK too. Prices, hey, its Singapore. They had a beer special from around 10pm to 12:30am with all you can drink for $25! I had three 0.5L, so I got a good deal. My colleague only drank one, so we lost on him. I would go here again, mostly for the festive atmosphere
2
Food is within average but defo overpriced, Stuff kept approaching us to refill our beer mugs, though we asked them not too (few times!)Karaoke (!!??) was terrible. we immediately moved outside but perception that someone is being killed on the stage followed us there. TortureNot going there anymore,Thanks
4
We discovered a micro brewery in Dempsey Hill called Tawandang which brews some good German styled beers and offers good Thai food. Definately worth a visit.
5
Good place to feast on Thai and German food. Beer is fantastic and so is the thai music and entertainment. Great for family and friends!
4
It is good place to visit with friends especially if your vegetarian. I love the veg tom yum soup and veg pineapple fried rice. It is vegetarian friendly restuarant. It is better to book in advance, weekend too crowded.
5
Food is excellent, price is inexpensive and very friendly, but crowded iver the weekend. Snd check by the phone and book in advanve
4
Nice Thai restaurant located in Dempsey. Food was a little expensive for my taste but with the singing and dancing in the background, it is value for money.
4
Spotted this place a few days ago and decided to come back as it had a certain appeal. Lively atmosphere even for a Monday. Quick attentive service. The Lager was excellent - a real smooth German style beer. And the food -despite the fusion (confusion) of German and Thai specialties was tasty. Would come back - more for the beer and the atmosphere - and maybe go for just German food next time. The fish cakes are a delight too
3
I had stayed on bangkok for more than a year and this place does resembles some of the restaurants in bangkok. The restaurant's concept is very similar to those in Thailand. However, I find the food to be mediocre and priced at a premium. Most probably it's the fact that the restaurant is situated at Dempsey where rental is pretty high.
1
The food was delicious although pricey but what makes it worst is the service is terrible... Staff did not seem willing to serve or even taking order. To think that it was off peak and there was merely 2 tables occupied. A disgrace to the Thai hospitality service which is renowned for. The price that you pay is definitely not worth the service extended.
4
The beer and food were nice... entertainment was very nice with live performances. At times the staff will come out singing a birthday song for the surprise guest. Overall a nice experience and will go back there again. Parking may be an issue if you arrive late
5
Last night our friends brought us to this place that offers Thai band, freshly brewed beer, and great Thai food. The band had several programs interesting shows like- cats ( where they sang memories ) with dancing people wearing cat attire; cleopatra, thai dancing, and so much to mention. They also have one part when all the waiters and bar people and guest dance YMCA plus a local song. And on mondays if you sing with the host, you get 30 percent off on your food bill plus A beer! :
3
Great location and above average ambience; but generally the food, drinks and service are average. Its a decent place to celebrate b'days as they have a fun b'day parade that they do and can accomodate large groups.
4
Thai&German fusion. What a combination!. The beer choices are limited but good. The beer is not too cold, which I like. Try the salted fried chicken. Great snack to down that extra pint of beer
3
I had expected a place where there would be hundreds of beers from around the world on offer. There was beer alright, but only a few kinds were available. Being named a microbrewery is a bit misleading, I think. But what really threw me off was the absolutely weird mish-mash of onstage performance. There was a Thai band doing Thai songs, tunes from the '60's, a dance revue (!?!?), present-day pop songs, etc. It was always something different everytime I looked to the stage. Good for people who like variety, I suppose, but disconcerting for those expecting a certain uniformity in music.The food was your basic pub food, Thai style at that. It was not great eating there. Portions were small, and many dishes were below average in taste and presentation. If you want good Thai food in Singapore, try the fast food courts in shopping malls but not Tawandang.The location seems to be a hit with Singaporeans as I understood Dempsey to be a place where the cool crowd hangs out, with some interesting restaurants and stores in the same enclave. Parking is difficult to find, though.If you are confused about your dining options in the city, Tawandang will add to that confusion
2
Overpriced Thai Food & Cheesy Performance.Everything was expensive! A small plate of morning glory cost us $18++, 4 small piece of pandan chicken cost us $11++ and the list goes on.Band performance looks straight out of Patong area, thumping loud music, with a couple of lady dancers prancing around. Definitely not my cup of tea - and not family friendly.Would not go back
3
Have been a few times now and each time I have been less impressed. The service was ordinary, they forgot to bring out our grilled cockles which seemed less than fresh, the beer was bland and the band was aimed at a strange market...K Pop meets the Carpenters. Hmmm. Our visitor from Australia was not impressed and we knew that there are much better places to eat in Dempsey. Gave it our best shot but won't be returning.
2
I live in Bangkok and am very used to simple Thai cuisine, and have also been to Tawandang in Bangkok several times.The Singapore outlet is a disappointment compared to Tawandang Bangkok. The food is acceptable, the beer is ok, but the atmosphere and band were terrible
2
Colleagues and I decided to have Thai for dinner and regretfully I recommended going to Tawandang based on something I had read some time ago. Had the Grilled Sea Bass, meat was mushy but flavors were quite good. Tom Yum was decent but nothing to shout about. Morning Glory was unique in cooking style and presentation, but was rather bland. Their signature Pork Knuckle was a real let down, it was neither crispy nor succulent, in fact the rind was rather rubbery.Beer was okay.Overall, the food was not bad, it was just average. But at Tawandang's prices, we had expected better than average
5
Their spicy tom yum soup, pineapple fried rice, and mango sticky rice dishes were to die for. Not too keen on their more German fare, although they had a beer that was pleasantly mild enough that I liked it. The restaurant looks great, and they have a lot of traditional Thai decorations around the place. The live music was kinda so-so, I could take it or leave it. Overall I'd go for the yummy Thai food
5
A pity the Suntech branch is closed at the site gets refurbished, but having been to both the east COast and Suntech sites all I can saw is a good wheaty ales set is served alonside piping hot good Thai food. I just hope they go back int othe centre soon
3
Has all the essentials but doesn't add up. Beer was fresh but kinda lacked flavour, food is ok, ambience is ok, service was good but entertainment was a let down....And at $65 per head for 2 glasses of beer and some food the price didn't exactly add to the mirth
4
It's a restaurant with entertainment show time at night.
Food is nice, prices fair, entertainment entertaining... sure a good night out away from the shopping belt, away from the city.
3
Great beer, inexpensive, some of the menu items are very good but need to choose wisely. Service could be much better
5
It was certainly a surprise to find a German microbrewery serving fine Deutsche lager and Thai-flavored Eisbein. The ambiance after a long workday was fabulous, the service was even better, and the food, given all the cholesterol, to die for. The atmosphere was contagious and we hall had a marvelous time
5
We were three wrapping up negotiations on a complex deal. We had details to iron out and though this place has a reputation for being 'alive' we were almost the only guests in for lunch. A friendly and perceptive lady brought us drinks and delayed taking a food order whilst we swapped files on USB sticks. (My apologies, I hate people doing that in restaurants.) Once we had finished being nerdy we ordered some of the best Thai food I ever had. Green curry to die for, crispy chicken, pad thai and pineapple rice were all good. But, our host had saved the best until last: Sea Bass! Baked in foil to perfection, a real treat. As it was business we did not try the beer, which is a real shame..but next time
5
Been to the one in Bangkok 2 years ago and recently tried out the one in Singapore.A good place to hang out with friends or colleagues to catch up.The variety of Thai food and the quality is good. The beer is brewed in house. Surprisingly the performance is quite impressive.What I like most is the atmosphere of the place.....
2
The restaurant is located in a corner in demsey, surrounded by some greenery, food is so-so, nothing worth mentioning. Interior is not great either, a little run down, but kind of "natural". Price is slightly on high side but not overly priced, perhaps it is the premium you pay for the location and ambience. You may consider to go there if you have no where to go and looking for a quiet place to chill out and have some basic thai food

Although TA seems to like placing a number of night spots in its restaurant listings, I don't consider Tawandang German Brewery (both locations in Bangkok and this one on Dempsey Road) to be restaurants - but rather night spots at which one may eat.This was my first visit to a Tawandang in Singapore, after many visits to Tawandangs (under the same management, and others) in Thailand. The theme for all is drinks and music, with available food. Usually without a cover charge, one must expect the drinks and food prices to cover the entertainment as well as other overhead.The location is a bit out of the way for public transport access - surrounded by a bunch of wanna-be upmarket places away from main traffic arteries. This particular location has a few outside tables. (Yes, as previous reviewers have mentioned - the tables face a parking lot. But creative lighting of a tree in the midst of that lot shifts the mood from car park to garden - at least a bit, in the views of the folks in our party. The outdoor tables were very pleasant on our visit.) There may be ~150 seats inside (compared to ~1500 seats in the SMALLER of Bangkok's venues under the same ownership).Current prices for site-brewed micro-brews are:0.3L = S$120.5L = S$151L = S$282L = S$54On Wednesdays, there's currently a promotion: buy one get one gratis. The gratis one is delivered with the paid one - in our case they did not object that two different people drank the paid and gratis mugs - so this seems a good deal on micro brews in S'Pore. On the night we went, Weizen was not available, but I wanted Dunkel anyway. (Lager is also available.) BTW, this Dunkel seems very slightly fuller-bodied (and thus very slightly better to my palate) than its Bangkok cousins.Looking at previous TA reviews, we decided to eat elsewhere, and arrived here at 10+PM, just in time for the last set of the band. The shows here are (understandably, considering comparative sizes of the places) more limited in scope - mostly just the band. At the end of their last set, however, they encouraged audience participation in a jam session - which could be nice if the right people are in the audience.In response to other reviews - service was fine. And on Wednesday night as when we went, drinks value is excellent for Singapore.There were only about 25 people in the place at 11PM on a Wednesday. How to make this place more popular? Could adding some well-priced and well-crafted Singaporean favourites to the menu help? Though the two branches in Singapore aren't exactly adjacent - can Singapore support two Tawandangs (or even one if it's not perfectly placed and perhaps adjusted a bit in its business model) from the outset

Certainly the main Thai cuisine restaurant in S'pore if you want great food with fun and entertainment. The prices are not cheap but you get great tasting dishes and nightly "Live" entertainment (except Mondays, 730pm onwards) with "imported' Thai singers & dancers. The fun factor depends on the singers' on his or her rounds but invariably it's a fun place to dine & entertain guests.Do order the 2 liters beer tower, Tom Yum Soup, Crispy Pork Knuckle (signature dish), Pineapple Rice, fish/prawn cakes...and end with their lovely coconut/ater chestnut-based cold Red Ruby or/and sticky rice with mangoes....For beer chill out session, the cosy day bed outside the restaurant are lovely. Be warned, it gets pretty crowded as it's a popular joint. The service from the predominantly Thai staff are brisk and efficient and friendly....Life's great ....sabai sabai ^___
5
If you love Thai food and want some home-brewed beer to share with a group of good friends, this is a place to visit. I personally am not a beer lover but the selection of brews and Tawandang satisfy even the fussy. And I must say I had the best beer I've ever tasted here. There is a band that sings at night and the service crew joins in on stage sometimes too! A casual hangout. Not suitable for a romantic date though
2
Before I can sit down to enjoy the food, I was already turned off by their service staffs' attitude. I made reservations and upon approaching the main entrance, there was no one there to assist. When I stepped in to try to get somebody's attention, a staff by the name of Azmie said "Can you wait to be seated". Wow....no welcoming smile, no please, no thank you. Another female staff came over after awhile and with no smile on her face, checked our reservations and showed us to a table in the middle of nowhere and the restaurant was totally empty. The table was located right smacked in the middle of many other tables and so close to each other I can put my elbow on the table next to ours. We then requested to be seated outdoors at a table in a quiet corner instead. Luckily for us, the next female staff assigned to out table was very sweet and polite. She was very attentive and prompt with her service. Food was average. We visit Thailand quite often and there are lots of street food that is of the same quality and at a fraction of the price. Considering the poor service attitude that came with the average food, it is not worth a second visit. What a pity how a few black sheeps can ruin the image of an otherwise nice restaurant

This place has great german beer. I like the Dunkel which is the dark wheat beer. It has hints of vanilla and chocolate. Food is great too.
3
I was disappointed with this large scale, noisy place that served average to poor Thai food. While I enjoyed the beer the food was so-so. I won't rush back and will try other restaurants in the Dempsey Road area next time.
2
Its seems a pity to write a review about the Suntec venue on the Dempsey Rd site, but after 2 attempts to get TA to add the Suntec site, I gave up trying. So, note, this review relates to Suntec.I was not sure what to expect when take here. I will come out and say upfront, I am not a big fan of boutique breweries, and this one has not altered my opinion. The place was well patronised for a weekday night, it appeared to be work groups of varying sizes celebrating things, or just "bonding". It was quite noisy, and the tables are close together, so expect noise from adjacent tables. The service was only just ok. There is a range of Thai food on the menu, but once it arrived, it left me a bit cold as to quality. It was I felt, at best, average. The beer, which is the main reason for this place, is ok, but crazy priced. There was a band playing, which generally was ok. I ordered a lime juice, and got a glass of ice with lime coating. One sip on the straw, gone. Very expensive glass of ice. I wont be rushing back here again, there is better food, better venues and better value in Singapore

Love thai food and german beer - so this is paradise. Microbrewed german beer with your tom yam and local thai dishes - yumm indeed. Tawandang @Dempsey has a more happening feel and dining amidst nature. If like me you love choices, Tawandang has an endless list of local thai food on the menu which always seem right when downed with a very cold glass of german beer. Recommend this restaurant before you take to the dance floor later
4
The huge crispy pork knuckle and deep fried fish were nice and good in portion.However, be really extra careful... the staff is not so attentive when taking order, so reconfirm your order several times and check your bill thoroughly.We ordered a lunch special Tom Yum soup for $10, and we were amazed at the quantity of big prawns in the hot pot.At the end, we were really disapponinted because actually the staff gave us $30 soup and we have to pay for that. Also in the bill, which we just realized after leaving restaurant, we ordered 2x coconut shake and but the price was different. The first they charged us $5 and the second was $6 (menu price was $5

It was a late Friday spontaneous decision to try out Tawan Dang at Dempsey. We managed to get a nice table n had a go at testing the various types of beer brewed in- house - and what a wholesome experience it was: natural beer without added enzymes and chemicals - 3 cheers to the brewmaster for an excellent job. The food variety offered on the menue is impressive but could the management please actually replace the tatty overused menue prints; a better graphic design n layout would also make first impressions more positive. The 4 of us had a variety of Thai dishes - nice portions - well presented - and abt 90% original in taste n flavour. Whilst some reviewers here seem to be unhappy abt the service - we were very happy with the high level of quality service - it was a full house and yet our table as well as the tables near us were given full attention. This is a great place for casual dinner for 2 but even better for birthday pr a corporate event
3
My friends and I went to Tawandang at Dempsey for post-exam celebrations. We got there before the end of happy hour and managed to try a few of their beers which were good. However, the food was disappointing. The pictures on their menu are a mis-representation of what was really served. Overall, a disappointing expereince
3
Nothing impressive about this place. We have been wanting to try this out for a long while, and finally did it on 2nd Dec. It was a Friday, and there seems to be an event going on inside the restaurant, so we sat outside. Tried all 3 of their own brews. Can't say much, as they tasted quite normal and the dark beer actually tasted a little watered-down compared to other breweries. But if you like something easy to drink and light, I think this would be it. We ordered a Pork Knuckle & some spring roll. Pork was cooked quite well, and the sauce was interesting. The spring roll was boring. Guess we ordered the wrong food! We might go back again to try the soup that we saw quite a number of tables ordering. I think this place would be more suitable for a group of people instead. Come with more friends and order more stuff to try. It might be cheaper also
3
We visited the Dempsey location for dinner over the weekend. Restaurant is large, loud and fairly casual, with servers dressed in soccer jerseys. They have an interesting menu of traditional Thai dishes like Tom Yum Goong, Prawn Cakes & Pad Thai, alongside German dishes like Pork Knuckle, sausages and a nice range of beers. We ordered from the Thai menu only that evening.The food was of average quality and overpriced. Service was prompt and friendly. There was a `live' band belting out cheesy 80's & 90's hits. If you want to be able to hear yourself over dinner, then ask for an outdoor table. The loud music and decor of the place made the restaurant tacky and cheap looking. This place would probably do better as a sports bar than a restaurant. I would probably not go back there again
4
Located at the base of Suntec conference centre, it is obviously the perfect place to go after a long day of conference. As it happened last night (18th October 2011), aside our large party there was also a huge number of Expedia delegates, all of them with a Tripadvisor Badge! Funny! Anyway, the place was bustling with people, yet we were served very quickly, and the food was, for such a place with such a crowd, good. Only the wine was terrible, but this is a beer place and for wine drinkers like me, not the best one to drink!After a while there was a small orchestra playing on stage, the music was at the right volume to allow us to talk, and was mainly of the easy listening type. And the band allowed one of us to go on stage and play guitar and sing (well), which was a friendly gesture.Of course, this is not a place for romantic or high level business dinners. It is for large gathering of conference crowds. But they fulfilled theur task admirably well: the restaurant maitre or owner came at least 4 times to our table to ask if all was ok, and service was attentive and fast
