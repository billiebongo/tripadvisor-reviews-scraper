Short walk from Kovan MRT Station to Soon Soon Teochew Porridge Restaurant. Authentic home-cook Teochew cuisine, a little bit pricey but the food is tasty. Open daily from 10.30 am till 9.00 pm, CLOSED on Tuesdays.

This is our all time favorite Teochew Porridge to go in the morning. Be mindful to come earlier for lunch as the variety of dishes tend to sell out really fast.The sambal hey-bee-hiam is good, the duck breast is our usual.We usually feel a sense of satisfaction when we walk pass the huge crowd/wait at Lola's cafe because we know we will be getting even better comfort food at a reasonable price!Even after moving away, we still travel down here to eat every now and then
