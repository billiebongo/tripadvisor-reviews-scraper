The Coconut Club's Nasi Lemak completely hit the spot when we visited them. The price was great, the venue was trendy, and the service was excellent.

We sought this out for their excellent cendol, an icy dessert which my husband remembered lovingly from his childhood. It was delicious there! Go for it!
5
Excellent Nasi Lemak plus a few side dishes, quality ingredients cooked simply, short but excellent drinks list, very friendly and helpful staff. Go early or late as there's no booking and it gets very busy.
4
Been there few times. One thing I notice is the taste of the fried chicken is not very consistent. Other items are consistent like the nasi, ikan bilis.
The egg plant dish was pretty good as well.
5
Love the nasi lemak especially the chicken that is so authentic! Oh myyyyyy... Only the true will know why a cendol is a cendol and you get it right at this place. Excellent and I would give it a 5 star anytime of the day. Kelab Kepala, way to go!

The nasi lemak here is simply awesome. A typical chicken set comes with fresh and tender chicken thigh, egg sunny side up, generous amount of peanuts and ikan bilis, some slices of cucumber, large dose of sweet spicy chili. We usually order one chicken and one otah set to share, and end off with a chendol that has a slightly burnt taste. Cost S$35.The staff are friendly and fast. In particular, look out for this young bloke who exhibits the best customer service and leads by example, he is everywhere, chatting with diners, washing, preparing drinks and serving!The only downside is that the place is always crowded!Always leave the place feeling good

I am a huge fan of Nasi Lemak and have tried so many places. But Nasi Lemal at The Coconut Club is in a league of its own. It is pricey compared to what you typically pay for this local dish, but it was worth every cent
3
I visited Coconut Club twice once to eat in and another to take away the nasi lemak. The rice was delicious n fragrant both times. The chicken was served with more fried ginger shreds during the dine. There was none in the take away. The sambal tasted better the first time and average in the takeaway. My son preferred the much cheaper Jia Xiang which we visited last week.
5
Been three times so far, amazing and consistently great every time. The sambal is a thing of beauty, captures the school canteen banana leaf nasi lemak memory, but oh! so much more... rice, just right, still no idea how he gets the chicken to come out the way it does,perfect mix of crispy and saucy!!, all the sides are “must try”. And then finish up with their signature Chendol... I am loyal to my chendol stand from school days in Klang but this one certainly tests my faithfulness!! Tried a whisky barley for the first time, chef’s recommendation! just the right drink to wash it all down!!Must try... nough’ said

Posting season and this is worth a good word. It’s not the median price but the rice, sambal is greeeattt and most of all the chicken and fish are all cooked when ordered. Great side dishes to accompany, and there is good quality local kueh. It’s a constant Saturday brunch venue.
4
Heard a lot about this place online and decided to try it out. It was very good. The rice was good and the chicken was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. On the whole, very good.
3
The fried chicken was good but the rest of the condiments were average. The chendol was a disappointment! Not sure why, there was a bitter after taste.
5
Have been wanting to come, eventually did and am truly very happy with their version of NL. Chicken were well cooked and succulent!! Love their calamansi and sour prune! Will be back for their dessert!
3
The nasi lemak is good, especially the chicken and the ikan bilis. The chicken is tender and the ikan bilis crispy. Chilli is spicy enough but the rice not as fragrance as expected. However, to pay $12.80++ for a plate of nasi lemak is not value for money, since the seating area is cramped and the restaurant is actually quite stuffy. The other side dishes are not cheap either. If it is to satisfy your curiosity, go for it but I wouldn't pay it a 2nd visit
3
Craving for luxury nasi lemak? You can pay the price and you will receive a big portion of the typical nasi lemak in Singapore. Their chicken taste delicious however their staff are quite unfriendly and kept chit chatting over the entrance. A bit too pricey for some locals and you may want to try once and let me know from your opinion too!
3
Over rated restaurant. Only the coconut milk rice smell and tasted nice. Those fried chicken or side dishes is nothing to shout about. Maybe tourists that frequent those area never taste other neighbourhood town nasi lemak before.12.80 sgd for a meal plus plus. Not worth it. Can give it miss
2
For a plate of Nasi Lemak costing $17.80. it is totally not worth it. the portion is big but the taste is average. there was a service charge when there was no service. ok granted, it was during the lunch crowd. the young servers were tired, frustrated and not willing to work. asked them if the menu is updated on their website, they said yes, but their menu on their website states no service charge and GST which is totally untrue. asked if they served warm lemongrass, they replied, of cos not right, the menu states ice lemongrass, how do I make it warm? I dont think he was really asking me how to make warm water (or maybe he really didn't know, then rude of me not to answer) but was actually trying to say nobody drinks warm lemongrass. how thoughtful then. #sorryforsucharidiculousrequest #howtomakewaterwar

This is a local nasi lemak experience like no other. Chicken was tender, juicy, tasty, and just the right size. Fish was huge (like 3X compared to typical stalls) and you can still taste the fish meat unlike the Changi Village and Adam Road ones which are basically shriveled up baby fish with hardly any mean. Otak was juicy with a nice spicy kick (you can clearly see the fish and taste the texture of the fish). Rice was just nice not too overpowering. Chendol and desserts were sublime...not too sweet and just the right amount of everything...Zak (I presume he's one of the owners) and his staff provided amazing service and checked in with us every step of the way as they were making a new batch of fish. Enjoyed the slighly retro decor and ambience. Well worth the wait and the money if you ask me! If you are one of those who think their food is too expensive, please step aside and eat the crappy nasi lemak at Changi Village and Adam Rd so my wait time will be reduced. I'll definitely be back again and again and again

As you may make out of the title of this post, The Coconut Club isn´t good – or rather a terrible waste of money and everybody´s time. They’ve put effort into the décor. Obviously you know it’s going to be nose-bleedingly expensive. That doesn’t mean it can’t also be good.A plate of nasi lemak with coconut rice, chicken leg, ikan bilis, peanuts, cucumber, fried egg and sambal set me back SGD12.80. And this was before adding on the otak-otak which was another SGD10.50. Sorely lacking were the things that make nasi lemak great: the flavour and fragrance. This is a restaurant predicated on one idea: that a single really expensive ingredient – specially brought in from Malaysia – will make your life better.I’m sorry to be the one to tell you this, but it won’t. This is the true truth as I say it as it is
2
The restaurant received a big boost when Prime Minister of Singapore, Lee Hsien Loong hosted President Rodrigo Duterte of Philippines to lunch there. Crowds of locals and tourists continue to flock there. As a result the restaurant does not take any reservations.The signature dish is nasi lemak and priced at $12.80, it is on the high side.Unfortunately the nasi (rice) has no oomph and the chicken thigh, despite the herbs, was dry. The accompaniments of ikan bilis and nuts did not help to lift up the dish.The verdict among the group-- "over-rated" and "over-hyped" The redeeming factor was the young and enthusiastic waitresses who were attentive and helpful

Awesome food very tender chicken, very tasty sambal chilli would definitely come back again. I hope it maintains its standard then.

My family and I had a great meal here at the Coconut Club. We arrived just shortly before they opened at 11am on a Saturday and we were fourth in the queue! Anyway, we were seated quite promptly and ordered our meal of three plates of the 'normal' set of nasi lemak with fried chicken, a plate of sambal long beans and one serve of the otah. The otah while tasty was not worth the price of around S$7. And I definitely have had better sambal long beans elsewhere ...But what Coconut Club is famous for is their nasi lemak and on this front it did not disappoint. The price of $12.80 already has people bringing out their daggers and sharpening their critical pens, but to me, the plate of nasi lemak is worth every cent. The egg was well fried as the yolk is still slightly runny, the sambal is both sweet and spicy (often Singaporeans prefer sweet over spicy but CC does balance both very well I think), the peanuts and ikan bilis are crunchy and flavourful.Most important of all, the piece de resistance - the fried chicken. This has been marinated in all sorts of wonderful spices and fried extremely well. It came to the table still hot ... hot enough that for the first few minutes, one cannot pick it up with ones fingers. And once I managed to grab a bite, the flesh was flavourful and tender with the aroma of the spices not overpowering the taste of the chicken.Along with drinks, the bill came up to over $80 for two adults and two kids (we ordered three plates of the nasi lemak). Next time we will skip the other non-nasi lemak dishes and just focus on the core competency of this restaurant

the photos did not lie. truly, the food turned out exactly like the photos. 3 of us were here for lunch today. pros : the food quality is very good. we love the way the chicken leg was cooked, the 4 slices of cucumber, the generous handful of crispy fried ikan bilis and peanuts. the sambal chilli is generous (but not chili hot enough for us). the rice is light and tasty. i would have preferred a fully fried egg instead of sunny side up (i don't like uncooked egg yolk). we also had a side order of baby egg plants and spicy clam - both very good. the dessert was the chendol and kueh. these are a 'must try'- make space for them.. they are not overly sweet. kudos to good service - hard to find good staff these days. despite the lunch crowd, we were served pretty quickly. one of the waiters (youngish male waiter- sorry did not ask name) was very accommodating when we asked for the homemade barley drink to be hot and not warm/cold as stated in the menu. he served the drinks hotter than expected. the staff are friendly, polite and energetic. cons : it's super noisy. i guess in order to maximise the space, the tables are a little too close to each other. i would return to try the other stuff on the menu, but will definitely avoid the crowd. give this a try at least once, even though the price is on the high side, you are paying for the music, service, and air conditioning

It's not cheap at $12.80 for a chicken set...But I'd pay this anytime!The rice was not heavy, was light and fluffy without an overpowering coconut flavour. The ikan bilis weren't too salty, were exceedingly crunchy and paired with the rice and chilli well. The chicken was the highlight - it was crunchy on the outside, full of flavour and juice on the inside. You could literally see this moisture oozing out when you put your fork into the meat. The chilli worked well with me because it wasn't too sweet, wasn't too spicy and was a good accompaniment to the rice. The cucumber and peanuts were...cucumbers and peanuts (Typically no one gets this really wrong) The portion sizes were sufficient for any regular guy. The chendol was ultimate and the Kueh Salat was brilliant, with a slight hint of saltiness to round off the sweetness of the dessert.I'd pay to eat here albeit more pricey than your regular nasi lemak joints

All the run of the mill Nasi Lemak with the coloured rice and tons of fried additions and oily sambal can take a hike! I am truly glad to find a dedicated team who have taken the torch of good food and is bearing through a competitive industry. Good quality ingredients, good proportion and a balanced flavours without an overwhelming sense of coconut. The rice was well cooked, fluffy with good coconut flavour with the greasy "lemak", good 2 large pieces of chicken with handmade marinade. And the star of the dish, the sambal was well balanced in its spice and other flavours. It was thick and jammy without the overwhelming sweet taste. For the price you pay, it appears to be expensive, however, you have unlimited rice, sambal, peanuts and ikan bilis. Hence in my opinion it was worth it! The much talked about Cendol was nice, but the lack of red beans was disappointing. Nonetheless, it was lovely to taste pure gula melaka in the cendol rather then the adulterated syrup

I was so overwhelmed when I finally get to try this Nasi Lemak "Coconut rice" which has good reviews .While queuing up , I overhead a couple of patrons saying that the add on side dish , curry vegetables was too diluted . So I was not looking forward to order. However , we did order the curry vegetables as we might be different taste buds from the others . True to the disappointment, it's was diluted .The rice itself is fragrance , with strong coconut aroma. Fried chicken which came with the rice was good. Sambal Chilli which was one of the major player in this meal was abit disappointed.However , it's an eatery I would come for once but would not be craving for a 2nd visit . Can re visit if I was asked by friends but not that really looking forward kind of attitude.No effect of wow factor on me.Pricing wise is ok, $12 plus for a set with 2 piece fried chicken, sunny side egg, anchovies, peanuts .The rice portion may not enough for guys.

Many have lamented the decline of the Singapore hawker food scene in the last ten years or so, with first generation hawkers phasing out, the lack of successors, and generic-tasting (read uninspiring) food in food courts. Enter the Coconut Club, which attempts to transform how nasi lemak tastes in Singapore. I had read a fair bit before turning up, and thank goodness, the queue was not nearly as long as feared. After a five-minute wait, we were ushered into the cafÃ© (?) by the service staff (all rather young). Needless to say, we both ordered the nasi lemak set, which came with a generous serving of peanuts and anchovies, an egg (slightly runny), some cucumber, and two pieces of chicken (thigh and drumstick). The dish was very enjoyable - the rice was fluffy and light; the accompanying sambal chilli worked a treat, and the anchovies were crispy and slightly salted. The star of the show however, were the two pieces of chicken; done Penyat-style (not rending) but my word, they were deliciously moist on the inside with a good hint of spice. We did also order the chendol which we had heard a lot of, but we were unimpressed. It was rather sweet (too heavy handed on gula Melaka?) and I would lean towards those we can get at a fraction of the cost elsewhere.This is the most expensive nasi lemak in Singapore. Apparently, the young entrepreneurs had painstakingly and meticulously taken a lot of time to source the best ingredients and condiments for the dish. I would say what's on the plate sums up the effort. Maybe, just maybe, the arrest of the decline of hawker food in Singapore would take another route
4
Good size serving (but expected for the price). The sambal is spicy but not as deep in flavour as I like it to be. The ikan bilis and peanuts are fresh and crunchy. The fried chicken is well cooked and seasoned. But for me, the star is the Otak Otak. Meaty, spicy and really enjoyable to eat.Overall a good place for nasi lemak and dishes that compliments it. But wouldn't spend time in a long queue for it
4
This is a very good example of Nasi Lemak, price is higher but you do get a much more premium fried chicken so I would rate this as really value of money. I would prefer the rice to have a more lemak (coconut) taste. The lontong is watery and the otah is quite okay but it really wasnt worth the 10.50 price tag. Decor is actually very nice but its a fast service restaurant where people eat and leaves quickly. Service is really very good and they will ask for feedback etc. Recommended
4
Food is very decent by most measure. As a guide a typical nasi lemak in singapore hawker centre cost $3-4 so $12.80 is somewhat pricey but to be fair the portion is large. Otah is definately not worth the $10.50 as it is nothing special. My personal opinion is that the chicken is more towards an ayam penyet and the coconut rice is very subtle so one can easily think it is penyet rather than lemak. That aside it does taste food so 1 visit to try is warranted. The chendol is impeccable so that is something to go for. Weekdays lunch are packed so go early.
5
Queued for around 20mins for a place during lunch. The rice is Super flavourful as you can see from the Color. The chicken is juicy and the peanuts and ikan bills are well fried. The belachan chili is spicy and sweet! 5 stars of Yums!
5
Best Nasi Lemak and Cendol I had eaten in Singapore. The chicken was crispy on outside and tender on inside. And the rice was awesome. The palm sugar on Cendol was so fragrance.
4
One of the best nasi lemak's in Singapore. It is expensive but the portion of meat is huge but portion of rice is very little! Wish they would add more rice though...Nonetheless excellent in taste.
4
Main dish is nasi lemak. Portion is 'filling' for me i.e. didn't feel hungry after lunch. They also have side dishes like sambal longbeans, egg plants and small selection of desserts like chendol...Long queue during lunch time but you can shorten wait by taking outdoor seatings if you don't mind the heat.Taste about same like most nasi lemak but I still gave Very Good rating so that tourists can still try quite good nasi lemak here if they are in Ann Siang Hill area

This is a decent place for visitors to try one of Singapore's well known dishes - Nasi Lemak. The kitchen takes a lot of effort to put out as honest a rendition of this dish as possible, but is probably still a tad rough around the edges. The main item on the menu is the nasi lemak, which is basically rice steamed in coconut milk and served with fried chicken parts, a fried egg, fried anchovies, peanuts and sweet sambal chilli. However the rice, which is actually the key ingredient, was neither light and fragrant nor dense and flavourful, leaving me slightly disappointed after having bought the hype about this place. The fried chicken parts were well fried with a generous rubbing of spice paste but also fell a bit short in the taste department. This was a decent attempt (3.5/5), but I'm not sure I would return.
5
Free-flow champagne/wine I get, but rice... really!HOWEVER, I did order more coconut rice because it is superb and so was the Nasi Lemak. The menu is limited, only Nasi Lemak Ayam (chicken) is avail. The chicken is tender not dry, the egg a little oily but tasty and the Ikan Bills crisp and salty. Perfect! The STAFF are friendly and super attentive.Another plate please
5
Read about this place and decided to give it a try. Great Nasi Lemak and the rice especially was superb. Fried chicken was excellent too. Add the otah and you have a winner! To top it off, you can order craft beer to have with your Nasi lemak. What more can you ask for
5
Heard rave reviews on this place and decided to try it. Was there on a Sat afternoon about 1.30pm and the place was almost full. Recommended to order the nasi lemak each and a fish or daily special. So we ended up ordering 2 nasi lemak, chendol, long beans and homemade iced lemongrass tea. Love the light, fluffy and fragrant coconut rice. Chilli was great! Loved the spiciness. Chicken was tender on the inside. Overall the nasi lemak was yummy... the only challenge we had was the portion which we felt was a little too much for a small eater. It was a really filling lunch and we couldn't have any dinner. Chendol had just the right amount of gula Melaka and the lemongrass tea was very refreshing.
3
We went to try their famous Nasi Lemak with great anticipation. This restaurant is extremely noisy, and very crowded. Regrettably the rice was not fluffy and as fragrant as it should be - it was soggy and clung together in clumps. We wanted to try a few dishes to enjoy the chef's passion for offering the best. We tried the Otak, the clams sambal, the eggplant, and the full range of desserts. We started with the Otak, which was so overly incredibly chilli spicy, it stunned us and numbed our tastebuds for quite a while! The eggplant was excellent and well balanced. The Kueh Bibingka was disappointing in taste. The Kueh Sarlat and Chendol were good and delicious! We will revisit this restaurant again and hope that the chef's passion will spur him to greater heights. We look forward to celebrating that day!
3
If no mistake, we can change the chicken leg to otakotak or fish then we won't get chicken leg but we still need to pay extra for the fish and otakotak at quite expensive amount, this way just doesn't make sense to me, but anyway overall was good but not meeting my expectation as I know a better one heh
3
Went on a Friday for lunch. There was a queue but didn't have to wait too long, around 20 mins for table for 4.Nasi lemak (supposedly the star but nothing to shout about)- Rice not lemak enough (not enough coconut milk/flavor?)- 2 pieces of chicken were tender, though some parts slightly dry- egg, ikan bilis & peanuts: nothing special- chilli is goodWe liked the side dishes - lala, egg plants and otak, all were pretty fresh.Ordered chendol for dessert. It is Indonesian style, so no red beans. The gula melaka is quite fragrant. Friendly service staff
3
Inspired by a visit to Malaysia and the Prime Minister of Singapore hosted the President of the Philippines here.I also read somewhere that Mahathir loves the source in Malaysia.Day 3 of opening for dinner.My verdict?Not as good as Adam Road or even Punggol Nasi Lemak. I prefer Chatterbox nasi lemak to this.It is not bad, just not fantastic.The rice needs a bit more coconut. The fried chicken was good. So was the sambal. The otah was chunky and delicious with some chunk of fish without being smelly. The curry vegetables were a miss, too watery and too many anchovies.The best on the menu: the kuih muih i.e. their Peranakan cakes. Excellent.Will I return? Likely no.And I don't judge food on price, purely on flavour.Nice friendly waiting staff though

When I first looked into the Coconut Club, I was a little unsure if I wanted to pay more than $10 for Nasi Lemak, which is typically a Malay breakfast, available very cheaply, even at kiosks near the MRT. But I was impressed by the manager (maybe owner?) at the door, who warmly invited my friend and I in. He said convincingly, that though I'm on a non-carb diet, I could still enjoy the other ingredients of their Nasi Lemak -- chicken, egg, otak (minced fish paste), etc -- and their other ala carte dishes. Both my friend & I agreed that it was this manager's friendliness & the quaint gentrified shophouse atmosphere that drew us in. We were also impressed by the staff's well-trainer readiness, efficiency & good reading of customers' visual cues. All these good-service points overshadowed the fact that The Coconut Club has a very limited menu! So don't go expecting an extensive array of food.Their Nasi Lemak tasted authentic -- very "Lemak" & has a generous portion (much bigger than the kiosk-type of Nasi Lemak breakfasts). The vegetable Lemak & Otah were also very tasty & generous, with just the right amount of spiciness for locals. Service, as mentioned, was friendly, prompt & attentive. And the turn-over of tables was swift. Something of note: there were no flies in the cafe. Usually the ingredients of Nasi Lemak would attract flies, especially since the door of the air-con place is open. The management must have done well to see to this detail. This is a good place to get a quick, good meal in a comfortable environment, in a interesting & historic part of Singapore. I'd recommend it to both locals & tourists

We all enjoyed their nasi lemak which came with fluffy fragrant and delicious rice, which is not too rich.It seems that their unique taste originates from special coconut milk, derived from coconuts sourced from certain parts of Malaysia.Their beautifully cooked rice pair very well with their chilli, ikan billis (anchovies), peanuts and succulent, tasty fried chicken leg. Slices of small fresh cucumber add crunch and coolness to this dish. Overall, a good taste symhony of the various elements to this nasi lemak.Their otak is also nice, but a tad overpriced.Their curry vegetable is good, but the gravy could be thicker though.Currently they only serve their nasi lemak during lunch. But apparently, they will start offering for dinner too, from July onwards.The cafe like atmosphere is cosy
5
I have been to The Coconut Club a few times now so that should definitely count for something! Yes, it is more "atas" (high-class) and pricier Nasi Lemak in a hipster kind of setting but get past that, and you will not be disappointed. The chicken is beautifully seasoned and every bite is juicy and delicious! The otah is absolutely yummy; you might get a mini heart attack with the price but it is worth it. It is smooth and chunky all at once. Their main star (for now) is their Nasi Lemak but I wouldn't be surprised if their Kueh (traditional cakes) will soon take the limelight. These are TO.DIE.FOR. Ladies/Gents: if you are looking to impress any future-in-laws with traditional desserts, this will hit the sweet spot! For now, the Kueh is not on the menu but just ask any of their friendly wait staff and they will share with you what is available and the cost. If you are lucky, you might even be given some for free! Unfortunately, my partner and I weren't one of the lucky ones. We were curious why people had boxes of Kueh passed to them and figured they might have been pre-orders. So being "kaypoh" (curious), we asked the wait staff and ordered ourselves some Kueh. Definitely a wise move! The Kueh was amazing and melted in our mouths. We are going back for the Kueh next time
5
Nasi Lemak in air conditioned shop house.Very good nasi lemak even though I'm not a nasi lemak fan.Ikan bilis are crispy yet not hard. For chicken it is only chicken thigh, no other choice. Comes with sambal.For fish today it is selar fish. It has just the right texture. Not overcooked like it so often is at Hawker stalls. Black sauce with onions and chilli is so good.Kueh salat has a strong taste of I can't quite make out what (coconut?). Not as good as Chalk Farm's.Chendol has a lot of gula melaka. Okay, not great.Ice lemongrass drink. Not nice
5
I would give 5 stars for service alone. The guy who served us, Nick, was full of smiles and good vibes. The food was excellent - yes, it's more expensive than regular nasi lemak from a hawker center, but it's worth every penny. Also loved the daily special of Sayur Lodeh. Thanks guys and keep up the good work
3
Not the authentic Singapore-hawker-type of nasi lemak. Over hyped reviews in social media, Facebook about the origins of the ingredients, e.g. rice, coconut milk, ikan bilis, etc.The rice was soggy - was told by their staff that it depends on whether it rained or not the previous 3 days. If it rained, the coconut milk will be such and such and therefore the rice will be more soggy, etc. The outcome of the rice is weather dependent? Where is the consistency I would expect from the chef?The sayur lodeh - 1 big hard piece from the end of the vegetable - the stalk. They don't bother to cut it to smaller bite size or peel the leaves from it.Was served 2 pieces of chicken. The drumstick was ok. But the other piece tasted powdery instead of sinewy.Sambal - average la. The ikan bilis was good and crispy.I have eaten better nasi lemak such as Chong Pang Nasi Lemak or Selera Rasa Nasi Lemak or at Changi Village. For $12.80, you can have 2 plates or more from these places.Also, the kuehs were small and pricey. Likewise for the chendol.The only thing they got it right is the marketing in digital media
5
Don't get me wrong, I love Singapore hawker food, but The Coconut Club is something very different. Everything here is about the ingredients and the perfection of the recipes. Nasi Lemak here is elevated to its highest level, so it is difficult to describe every flavour and texture, but the stand-out elements for me would be the fabulous crispy coating on the chicken and the perfectly fiery sambal. The iced lemongrass tea made a great refreshing accompaniment. Chef Eng Su is doing something very special here - just watching him working frantically through the glass window to the kitchen was enough to understand his passion
5
Lush succulent chicken, perfectly spiced, with good portions of peanuts, Ikan billis and pieces of cucumber, the rice is fragrant and full of flavour, all topped with a delicious fried egg!! The best Nasi Lemak I have ever tasted in Singapore. The Chendol is also the best I’ve had!! This restaurant is the good old fashioned variety, relying on top quality, fresh, ingredients and the skill of the chef.I’ll be back ..
