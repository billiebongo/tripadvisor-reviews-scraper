The set is good. Value for money. Service staff were attentive and accommodating. made changes to reservation time twice. Also changed the set menu main course after ordering and service staff was able to assist.
5
Loved that they present you a tray of all the freshest ingredients available for the day and they explain the origins, best cooked with, etc... Most enjoyable experience from start to finish. Great service too!
5
Very visit to Gunther’s never ceases to amaze me. Each dish is exquisitely made. Service is also excellent
4
Made a last minute reservations for a friend's surprise birthday lunch. Restaurant made the effort of finding out my friend's name as they could decorate the cake. Very good touch!
5
Food was excellent and service was prompt. Was here for dinner some time back and back here for lunch. Down side was food took some time to reach our table and I attribute that to a big group of guests in a separate 'room'. The prawns in the pasta dish were also just dumped into the dish instead of being presented in an aesthetic way. And I know this isn't how the dish is supposed to be plated as I saw the big group having the same dish and the prawns were arranged properly. Not a big issue but be prepared to wait for your dishes and loud chattering/laughter as if you were in a cafe should there be a massive group. Otherwise, food was great and will be back!

Caught up with a friend living in Singapore and we decided to go back to Gunther’sagain for lunch. Very formal interior and classy. The popular 3 course set lunch at a reasonable price was still on offer and we decided to try it again. I started with a chilled tomato veloute, then pasta with seafood & a cheese platter for dessert. My friend started with the ravioli foie gras, roast chicken for main and apple tart for dessert. Coffee was served with mini friands and chocolate. It was a perfect lunch with delicately prepared and delectable dishes. Service was great and great wine list with a few by the glass. Highly recommend and definitely coming back

Came here for dinner with a party of four. The restaurants location in Purvis Street close to Beach Road is a bit off the main tracks of tourism flows, which is good. Parking could be a nuisance but is done by a valet service upon arrival, so all good.I am not particularly fond of the interior decor of the restaurant with its black-colored walls, but I was told that after 11 years a major overhaul and renovation is coming up. That’s good news, as long as the excellent service stays the same afterwards and the excellent food as well. Had half a dozen fabulous Irish oysters as a starter, followed by a whole red snapper - and that was probably the best fish I ever had. Try it yourself. Dinner rounded up by an apple tart and including a bottle of French white and coffee afterwards, the bill clocked SGD 1100. It’s real Money - well spent. Second time I have been here - and happily come back once you got rid of the black tapestry

Celebrated my wife’s birthday and it did not disappoint. The staff were friendly and helpful with their recommendations. The angel hair pasta and beef steak we had were delicious. The seafood consommé was brilliant. The only disappointment was the onion soup, which was a bit bland. But they made up for it with a complimentary ice cream treat and mini dessert platter. Would recommend for a special occasion
4
Three of us went for an early Xmas dinner. We chose the six-course degustation menu at SGD 250 each. It was a surprise menu by Chef and we opted out foie Gras. We were all very impressed with the freshness of the food and were surprised with their signature dishes - truffle cold angel hair pasta with decent serving of caviar, toro, big clams, king crab legs with Italian tomato risotto, Wagyu steak...as you can imagine these are the best selection of ingredients and everything were cooked to perfection. It was a fusion of cuisines, a bit of French, Italian and a hint of Japanese influences. We all thought it was really good value for the food quality you get. Would have deserved a five stars, one star taken away was really for the fact that we were seated next to entrance and was a nuisance when people open and close main door we will get a gust of wind and also we were really confused by different servers explaining how the degustation menus work. Anyway we will definitely be back just for the superb food quality
3
Was greeted by an aloof staff, but the others who tended to us were very friendly and helpful.The ambience was lovely, dim and romantic. Great for couples celebrating their special day.Food wise- We had their specialty Cold Angel Hair Pasta with Oscietra Caviar, which was amazing as a starter. I am grateful that the chef actually portioned the dish into two as we were sharing. The Beef carpaccio was unique, but the onion gratin was nothing special with hardly any gratin on the shallow dish. The rib eye steak had a very nice meaty flavor, but unfortunately it came quite late, so we were both pretty full by then. However, we were pleasantly surprised by a tempura starter and dessert platter complimentary from the chefs
5
perfect food, perfect service, perfect atmosphere..
Even though I visited Gunther's alone, I could feel that every managers and servers are really care of me.
Thx

Tried the restaurant week menu.
Enjoyed every bite. The smoked pigeon was moist and soft. Sauce alongside was lovely. Soufflé well done. Fluffy and soft.
5
Dinner was wonderful! It was a tremendously sumptuous dinner experience. Would like to specifically compliment a staff by the name of Lennard for his meticulous service throughout the dinner! His recommendation was great & service rendered was superb!
5
I visited with my mother. Kind servers provided a pleasant experience. Beef carpaccio and apple tart are so nice.
4
Celebrated my anniversary here and had the 4 course menu. Cold pasta with truffles and caviar was the highlight.
4
Visited for a business lunch. Decided to go for a la carte rather than the set menu. They had some specials including Japanese mushrooms, sole, crab etc. The burrata starter was good but not outstanding, the angel hair pasta though was an excellent starter. In the mains the grilled sole was excellent as was the grilled crab claw. Service and decor is very Low key and quite subtle. Good for a business lunch but would suggest the set rather than ala carte.
5
Reservation was relatively easy, maybe because I was a solo diner. The restaurant was full for dinner, but I was seated immediately. Ambiance was great, very minimal decor which meant they were serious about tablescape—and just like any classic fine dining restaurant, silver, china, and stemware were immaculately placed on top of plain white linen. The mini baguette and french beurre sal were fantastic, I had to ask for a second serving of the butter, which was made by Gunther's chefs, of course. Specials of the day were presented professionally and the server was very knowledgeable about each ingredient, and the various ways it can be cooked. A la carte menu was sufficient, and the wine list was vast! Service was immaculate and seamless, yet friendly and unimposing. In contrast to the minimalist and formal dining room, the atmosphere was very warm and casual—a perfect compliment to the stellar cuisine that Chef Gunther and his team whips up. I came for the Alba truffles, and was thoroughly pleased and satisfied with every dish I ordered. Gunther's is definitely worth the trip, and lived up to all the accolades it has to its name
5
If you're going to Singapore this is the place for dinner. Small restaurant, with very attentive staff, every course was excellent. The best was the chef's signature angel hair pasta and caviar. Every bite full of flavor and melts in your mouth. It's a bit pricey but worth every penny
5
We wanted a certainty for a Friday night after a big week. Gunthers is assured and impressive. Great worldly wine list and expansive menu. The tray of the day's fresh meats and seafood was a treat to consider and led to me ordering both courses from it: a delicious baked scallop and truffle dish followed by lobster. I was not taken with the suggested chile and tomato pasta so the host kindly suggested an aglio e olio spaghetti. The lobster they de-shelled at my request and therefore this was a delight to savour. My partner had a delicious truffle soup and then a pork belly with large pasta shells main, described as beautiful. We shared their signature apple tart for dessert with a good glass of red. Gunthers is not cheap, but we didn't even look at the prices and perhaps given the restaurant is quite small that is exactly the clientele it seeks and needs. Not an every month place by any stretch, special in every way.
4
We tried the chef's lunch degustation menu and it was amazing. The dishes are not the run of the mill you get to see in every restaurants. Presentation is top notch, showing the care taken, the taste is great and there's quite a bit of creativity going on here.The staff is excellent, very knowledge and know what they are talking about when they recommend anything.Maybe on the pricier side, but it's a great experience. one can definitely think of this place for special occasions and business meets
5
Always a pleasant and enjoyable pleasant dining experience - both food and service. Very appreciative that they helped us rushed through the lunch a little as we had to get back to office within a prescribed time.
4
Lunch set value meals at $38++ for 3 courses plus coffee. The crispy egg starter was good. For mains: Gunther's creation a vegetarian meal was surprisingly good and creative. Book in advance as reservations are required for this popular place.
5
I really like the service provided by the restaurant and the lunch menu was value for money. the wagyu steak was great.
5
definitely must try the cold angel hair pasta - well deserving of the title of trademark dish. fresh ingredients brought out in the beginning for added flair.

Unfortunately not what we expected for two reasons:1. Based on statements on the website, we expected simple but good French food. The menu (in my humble opinion) had nothing to do with French food: shrimp tempura, wagyu beef, king crab etc. 2. the quality of the dishes were not bad, but did not justify the high prices. In general plain dishes laced with ingredients such as caviar or truffle to 'elevate' them. Unfortunately something more often seen in "French" restaurants across Asia. If you're looking for good 'honest' French food without a fuss, Gunther's is not it. If you're looking for "french-asian fusion" with expensive ingredients in an up market setting, then you might find what you're looking for.
4
Belgian chef who does not overdo fusion between French-Belgo cuisine and Asian influences..Angel hair pasta with caviar was a delicious starter. Australian truffles as a seasonal addition did a good job. Gunter's has an extensive wine list with a lot of French treasures. Our table was delayed by 45 minutes which was a bit of a downer when you have a 8:00 slot but the team was great and helped to ease the pain and hunger with complimentary champagne, bellota ham and a smile
4
Dinner on Friday.Free valet parking available & needed as street parking can be a pain to find during dinner time.Big round table to accomadate 10 of us.Cosy dining room that was well cooled not stuffy so it's comfortable to enjoy food & wine there.Huge selection of pricey off the menu items which were presented tableside on a gigantic silver platter.We had a huge variety of dishes which were mostly well executed.But to be expected due to the prices they were charging.2 favourites of the night were Truffle pasta & Langoustine carpaccio w caviar.Great service throughout by Jeffrey, attentive but not intrusive
4
Monday was corkage free day so we made a visit to Gunthers.The chef could customise the dishes so we had black truffles in almost all the dishes, the cold angel hair, the risotto, the shell pasta and the Alaskan king crab leg.All well executed. But somehow the dishes were more Italian than French
5
It was wonderful to be back at Gunthers. Celebrated a friend's birthday with lunch and we were not disappointed. As a base, we had the S$38++ set lunch and added specials from the tray - penshell in wonderfully tasty stock garnished with sakura ebi and mushroom (1 shell to share among the 3 of us); beautifully fresh and tasty Irish oyster (1 each), naturally sweet gambas (2 serves) with well balanced tomato pilaf piquant with a whiff of spice. As the birthday girl is a foie gras lover, we asked to swap the appetiser in the set for foie gras and was pleasantly surprised we could do so - much appreciated even though we have become regular patrons over the years.Finally, we tried the grand marnier souffle and was it divine. As we are not really into dessert, we have not really paid much attention to the desserts at Gunthers. However as the birthday girl has a sweet tooth, she opted for the apple tart with ice cream and I ordered the souffle so she has the best of both worlds. Great for all of us.We are pleased that service level, food quality and pricing have been maintained. It's great we can count on Gunthers to celebrate birthdays and special occasions
5
I have dined at Gunther's on multiple occasions over the years, and they have proved to be consistently good each time.They serve the most perfect mini baguettes that are warm and pillowy on the inside, and perfectly crisp on the outside. I had the foie gras with apple compote as my starter; the foie gras was perfectly seasoned but could perhaps do with a longer time on the pan for a better sear. Not too big a fan of the apple compote. I had lamb for my main, which was cooked to perfection and was bursting with flavor. It was one of the best lamb dishes I ever tasted. I chose a cheese platter in place of dessert, which was a nice selection including my favorite Camembert.Service was excellent as usual, with very friendly and efficient service. Gunther's has, and continues to be, one of my favorite restaurants in Singapore
5
There is no words that can describe my experience with this restaurant. Great food and service. Please do visit this great restaurant.
4
I came with 3 friends just to eat angel pasta with truffle and caviar.
It was simply a perfect lunch.
1
We were expecting quick business lunch however it was quite spoiled when the sommelier / manager pushed us to take more expensive courses all the while asking whether we have any budget to be respected. Errr how about one hour budget?
5
The Place - Smallish place with ~ 10 to 15 tables tops. Nothing too fancy but private conversations can be difficult if the place is full.The Food - Excellent food especially the signature Chilled Angel Hair Pasta with Caviar AND Apple Tart. Only slight disappointment was the daily special of fresh Hokkaido scallop, which wasn't as sweet as I would have expected it to be. The Service - Very good service without being too intrusive. Water was constantly being refilled and they were flexible in allowing us to split all our dishes into 2 portions for sharing. The Price - The 2 of us spent ~$400 on the meal and it was definitely worth it.
5
My return trip was even better than the first. The wait staff (didn't manage to catch a mame tag and wasnt around by the time we got the bill) was so friendly and accommodating, proactively taking the initiative to split some dishes for us. Great recommendations and oh boy the cold pasta was as good as I remember. The uni version (new btw) is, dare i say, evrn more amazing!! gotta try it it's the bomb.
5
Finally re-visited Gunther's after a long time. The selection was broad and the service was excellent.We had a red win, the pigeon and fish. The angel hair had a new twist which in itself was well worth the visit. Try that. Would definitely visit again.
4
Gunther's isn't a restaurant I frequent regularly due to how expensive it can get inside (and because I am terrible at dining etiquette), but when I do, I am always satisfied.It's great that they have a $38++ lunch set, which means I can frequent there more readily, if I can afford to take a longer lunch break. :)The gazpacho with burrata was an excellent starter on a hot afternoon - cold, refreshing, sour, and light, balanced by the richness of the burrata cheese in it.The roasted chicken, salad, pomme frite was excellent as well; the chicken was perfectly cooked, crisp and well-salted on the outside, and irresistibly tender and juicy on the inside.Dessert of the day was a panna cotta, with blueberries and a raspberry. Petit fours had my favourite French confection - a canele; lovely.It was a quick and simple lunch, and I enjoyed it very much
4
Gunther's is a very nice place for memorable cuisines. My wife and I enjoyed their delicious cooking and presentation.We were impressed by their handling of flavours that were just right, and the mix of ingredients ranging from caviar, to Hokkaido scallops, to Alaska king crab craw, to French pigeons, to lamb rack, to the flavoursome beef, and Japanese potatoes one could expect. The food was impeccable and often not part of the standard menu.The display of the ingredients on the large silver plate reminded us of a feast in roman / Tudor period, that was fit for a king. It was very impressive indeed especially one arrived early to see the full display for patron to choose - as the night went on the ingredients would become fewer, and it could become a bit "inhumane" to see the king crab's leg disappearing one by one as the waitstaff rolled out the plate to another table to choose.Like many other dinners, we had the cold angel hair pasta with Oscietra caviar, the Alaska king crab craw, the French pigeon, and to finish off with a fine apple tart "a la dragees" with Havana rum and raisin ice cream. It was divine! We had the Chateauneuf-du-pape for the evening, chosen from their impressive wine list. We enjoyed the delicacy and the cozy ambience in an intimate setting. Service was friendly and attentive
4
We have dined at Gunther's before. We walked in after a booking fell through elsewhere.The food is good, the pasta / caviar is as good as you would expect.The service is excellent, the prices are eye watering. Perhaps that's the vibe they are after.But for what we paid - $SGD700 per couple, really I just can't see the value
4
I walked past Gunther's recently after Garibaldi and decided to try it.It is very small with only a few tables so make sure you book.Service was generally very good with experienced staff advising on wines and cuisine.The Margaux by the glass was excellent, rated 91/100 on Wine Searcher.Overall the food won on flavour but limited innovation on appearance which is fine if good food is defined by flavour alone:).The pumpkin and truffle soup was average.The langoustine tasted great. My companion raved about the onion gratin too.The Alaskan king crab spicy sauce fettuccine was okay. The crab was fresh. The pasta was average. Beware the price $120 as it is not on the menu. They have a daily special fresh produce trolley.The sakura prawn tagliatelle with crayfish sauce was above average. Once again the pasta was not exactly al dente. A bit on the soggy side. I was able to replace sakura prawn with fresh prawns, which was delicious. Their special dessert apple tart was very nice but not sure why the ice cream was served separately.The French farm cheese came with decent selection. You will be allowed 3-4 only for $30. After I commented the serving size was rather limited I was given an extra small slice.The petit fours were pretty standard and looked unappetising
4
Took the set. They are flexible and allowed changes to the items. However they did not indicate the additional cost. Ended up paying another $90 on top of the $38 set for changing to tuna. Food quality and service were v good nonetheless.
3
I think chef add some extra ingredient like YUZU in capaccio but it doesn't taste good. I love their cold pasta and cappacio . Some ingredient is not fresh as before but the restaurant take it back and change.
4
Service is very attentive. Food served hot, taste good. Atmosphere is appropriate for business talk and good friends gather together for a good meal.
4
We ordered the set lunch and the tasting menus.The dishes were a délice to the eyes and also to the tasting palate.Some dishes arrangement looked like a painting and the wagyu beef was excellent !Dessert then coffee paired with canele and financiers were just perfect match. Thank yo
3
Sadly Gunther's is losing edge to its newer and more innovative competitors. How long are they going to serve their "signature" dish, cold angel hair pasta with caviar? Seriously the chef needs to move on. Wagyu steak and apple tart were so plain and flavorless - the bistro in my neighborhood does a better job. Service was abrupt and spotty too. They no longer justify their price tag.
4
Found this place by accident. They seated us with minimal fuss. White table cloths, attentive waiters and a very high end dining experience. They have a fabulous selection of signatures and daily specials. This all comes with a high price. I would eat here again for a special occasion. Try the apple pie dessert.
5
The restaurant is nice and I will definitely go again. The crews are also very friendly. If you don't know what to eat, they all are very kind to introduce to u. Although the price is quite expensive, the food is nice, so it's worth. I 100% like it
4
I had the set lunch. Service was excellent. Read some other reviews of people complaining the wagyu was too thin but I in fact enjoyed it as it was the right size to eat easily, the corn was easy to eat as well. Wagyu was cooked perfectly and went well with the mustard they provided which is apparently special. The apple tart with rum and raisin went together so well. The portions are just right for me - remember it's fine dining. Seems quite popular and suitable for business lunches.
5
Celebrated our wedding anniversary at Gunther's last week. Every dish was stunning in terms of flavours and ingredients used. Throughout the dinner, you can see Gunther stepping out from the kitchen at regular intervals to ensure that all his guests are well-taken care of. Despite all the fuss over the food and service, the maître d, Fendi, and his team of waiters made sure that we felt comfortably casual. All was tip top as expected at Gunther's once more :
5
Menu had a wide selection of choices. However, we decided to venture to the degustation menu which was to be an adhoc surprise creation by the chef. It was to be the right choice as the chef created some of his best signature dishes in one sitting. Service was impeccable. They were all polite, attentive ,knowledgeable and friendly. Dining room was a bit noisy but why not......everyone was having an enjoyable evening!
5
Very nice ambiance, staff are very attentive. They also explained the out of the menu food very well.
4
This was my second visit to this nice casual fine dining spot serving French cuisine. Food is fresh and quality is very consistent throughout the menu.
The Wagyu steak, penshell carpaccio and apple tart are our favourites!
4
Gunthers is my go to restaurant during white truffle season. Make sure you order the (1) white truffle angel hair pasta (warm) and the (2) roasted carabinero gambas, tomato flavoured rice. Free valet if you dine here, and a $70++ corkage fee per bottle.
4
This was our 2nd visit and until today, I had overlooked posting a review.
Classy place. Excellent service. great food. Very good wine selection, although rather pricey.
A lovely place to come to for a special occasion.
4
Ambience was good, service was extremely attentive, with staff knowledgable about what they had on the menu.
Meal was expensive but that is French food in Singapore for you.
5
Went for lunch with friends and enjoyed the food (set lunch at $38++) very much which has both vegetarian and meat fares and changes frequently enough so you're not stuck ordering the same thing. There's also a bigger menu and a market fresh platter option but that can be pricey for those on a budget.As usual the service was impeccable and we never had to ask for our water to be refilled or if we could have seconds on their delightful bread. They are quick to check and ask if we want/need anything, taking care to provide an extra seat for our bags.A must visit if you've never been and want some really good French food at reasonable prices
5
We booked in the understanding that this is one of the top French restaurants in Singapore - no mean feat in such a Goldie's paradise. Gunther's did not disappoint. Intimate setting, personal and knowledgeable service, excellent food. If you're happy to pay for it, would highly recommend. Angel hair pasta is a must
5
Still a firm favourite in singapore and am very disappointed that they are overlooked for the Michelin Guide as I firmly believe they deserve a one star. Its rare to see the owner chef still take so much interest in their restaurant and Gunther was always about ensuring service was top notch. kudos for the personal touc
5
I have been here many times and it's a must visit for me everytime I come to Singapore. And each time, I will tell myself to order something completely different from my usual favourite but never successful. First, I will start with the cold angel hair pasta topped with caviar and if you like you can request for sea urchin (it's quite pricy, if not mistaken about $45 per portion of uni) but ITS SO GOOD and it's best paired with a half bottle of chilled white burgundy Chassagne Montrachet. Then comes their magnificent tray. So, we chose the crispy eggs with shaved white truffles this time and it was heavenly indeed, just the right amount of salt and generous amount of white truffles. We also ordered the carpaccio of toro with caviar. Nice!As for mains, we ordered a wagyu beef medium rare done and it was very nice especially the grilled sweet corn that came with it. Previously ordered the Alaskan King crab legs that was cooked with some spices and I loved it too.If you like, you can BYO your special wine and they charge either $70 or one for one. Not too bad. Otherwise there are plenty of choices to choose from anyway.Service is excellent, price is steep but if you are looking for good food, they will never fail.
3
A party of 10 for business lunch.The service has to be said - is impeccable. We had constant attention throughout the meal. I (and the rest) really liked the fresh baked bread which they serve on the side. The orders that we made was well prepared and served replete with silverware cutlery. Cannot complain about the food.The menu pricing is on the higher end though there is excellent value in the lunch set and for a small addition, can be paired with a glass of wine
5
Had a business lunch at Gunther's and was very impressed by the outstanding service and food. Amazing selection and quality and high flexibility of the crew to meet any special request from the guests. A great place to eat.
5
Absolutely loveee this place! Tried their lunch set. Every course made our minds go "wow!" Simple starter like Caesar Salad was so different than what we usually had elsewhere. The combination of every single ingredients came together so perfectly that really intrigued our taste buds! I've never love my salad so much.My husband had their angelhair pasta and it was another dish that caused our minds to go "wow! what was that taste? it was so great! what's the ingredients? mmm..."This place left a deep impression in our hearts. Will love to be back again
3
My wife and I tried Gunther's as we understand it is owned by the same owner as Garibaldi's next door. We love Garibaldi's so we tried Gunther's. I estimated the cost of the evening from the menu on the website. However the way Gunther's works is that in addition to the menu, they specialize in bringing a tray of off-the-menu items to your table. A host will then spend 10 minutes explaining all the specials and bringing out other items in an orchestrated manner with the staff. We were tempted with the sole meuniere and the black truffle with egg. However, our bill was more than twice than I expected, as anything not on the menu is quite expensive. Also asking for a glass of dessert wine will be surprisingly costly. The sole was just acceptable, I've had better. The black truffle was a disappointment. The wines were stunning, with an extensive wine list. My advise is to be clear on the price as my experience was one of being up-sold away from the menu and the food was not a good value at the end of the evening.
5
We were a group of student from hospitality school, and so we came to increase our knowledge and observe what we learn in school in reality. And everything was a m a z i n g! The maître d'hôtel was very helpful, he knew their product, and has a very good manner to introduce dishes. The Chef was very friendly and helpful too. We could see the passion in these persons and it's very important to show the passion and give the want to perpetuate this work! Dishes were delicious!! never taste a so good canelé before!
5
We arrived at 730pm on a Friday, and began our dinner a little worried as to why we were only the 2nd table to be occupied. But our fears were quickly laid to rest when Gunthers became full house by the time it reached 830pm. With 7 types of appetizers, 3 Caviar specials, 3 soups, 3 seafood-themed rice & pasta dishes, 7 meat dishes, 1 cheese dish, 7 desserts, 3 types of coffee, the ala carte options available for selection available wasn't particularly anything to shout about, but I thought that this was perhaps testimony to Guthers preference to bet on more on quality & consistency, then to pull any risky new stunts.Service was professional and polite, which while something to be expected of a fine dining establishment of Gunther's standing, was worthy of our thumbs up when the waiter offered to split each of our dishes into two portions without us asking. While browsing the menu, the waiter charmed us further by pushing a trolley to our tableside and introducing us to their freshest imported produce which included Lobster, crab, oysters, scallops, mushrooms, tomatoes, pumpkin and sole. He then took pains to explain how they could prepare these items. Of these trolley items, I took 4 oysters which costed me $48. I think that price included the price of the caviar I think I added. More plus points for giving us a complementary frozen fruit atop vanilla ice-cream dessert with a lighted candle when I asked during the meal whether Gunthers offered any desserts that could be suitable for a birthday.For dinner, we had:- Carpaccio of Japanese Omi beef, Tartare style, crispy potato- Cold Angel hair pasta, Oscietra caviar- Seafood consommé- Truffle soup with pumpkin Veloutè, sabayon- Squid ink flavoured rice, grilled abalone- Dry aged Entrecôte, confit of shallot, bordelaise sauce- Fine apple tart “à la dragée”, Havana rum raisin ice-cream- Badoit sparkling water- 2014 Pouilly-Fume Boisfluery Domaine A. CailbourdinAnd I opted to upgrade my Angel Hair Paste with Sea Urchin, a decision which costed me $45 more. Everything was very good, but the Cold Angel hair pasta, Carpaccio of beef and the Squid ink flavoured rice, grilled abalone were par excellence. And saying that our oysters didn't disappoint is an understatement. The dinner started off well with the Carpaccio dish, the highlight of which we felt was not the beef, but the potato. The potato was so thin & crispy that even while savouring every bite, we were left trying to figure out what it was. We only came to realise what it was potato after revisiting the menu.But what topped my list was the pasta. Ooooooh! The heavenly Cold Angel hair pasta! A model of al dente perfection harmonised by an infusion of sharpness & profound intensity. It was so good that I have no other words! Squid ink flavoured rice. Frankly, I didn't expect much of a rice dish, but this one took me completely by surpise. It had flavours so deep and aftertaste so unami that the memory of that experience still lingers till today. I can't recall any other rice dish ever leaving such a deep impression.Btw, some diners have complained that Gunther's prices are too high. But just like restaurants with outdoor menus & menu boards that forewarn patrons beforehand, Gunthers has similarly published their ala carte offerings on the Internet. Excluding the outliers, on average Hor D'oeuvres cost $22, Caviar specials $63, Soups $35, seafood-themed rice & pasta $38, meat dishes $72, cheese $30, dessert $23 and coffee $25. So except for the meat dishes, careful selection without ordering any specials from the trolley shouldn't be that shocking. Hence, while the eventual bill might surprise some diners, I thought that complaining about their prices might be seem a little unfair. The fact that the restaurant was in Singapore Tatler's 2008's Best Restaurants list with a food rating of 10, while not appearing at all in the 2016's edition has left me all the more curious about the underlying reasons for such a drastic change in opinion. Lastly, coffee lovers might be interested to know that the Kopi Luwak listed in the menu is no longer available due to ethical reasons.In all, a very satisfying and memorable experience

I have been going to Gunther's for many years and I tried to patronize it everytime I visited Singapore with the family because I enjoyed it.I found Gunther to be very good then, but over the years, it has not created new excitement. Much the same as previous years, and indeed, it may even have slipped a bit.The angel hair pasta was still very good. However, they have used too much truffle oil. May be I have become tired of truffle oil!I had the red prawn with rice. That was all you would get. One red prawn cut in two and a scoup of tomato flavoured rice. Nothing else. No vegetables. The dish looked too simple. From a taste perspective, the prawn was good, but the rice was far too salty. It would be better if a few pieces of vegetables be thrown in for balance and colour.If you have never been to Gunther's, I still recommend you to try it. It is a bit on the expensive side though
5
The second most expensive meal I have eaten, the first being at a Michelin three star in France. Gunther’s was better – possibly the best meal ever. The food was outstanding and the service as well. The overall experience was capped by our waiter walking with us for a couple of blocks to show us where to board a bus back to our hotelI had a starter of white asparagus with Parma ham, morels and Hollandaise sauce – absolutely delicious (see picture). But this was exceeded by my rack of lamb, which came with asparagus tempura and a unique gratin dauphinois. I consider myself a connoisseur of gratin dauphinois and this one was the best ever. Usually, it comes in a lump or in a side dish, but this was almost like a crepe with a single layer of potato, on which the lamb was placed (see picture). The whole dish was stunningly delicious.My wife’s choices were similarly outstanding and we shared a delightful Grand Marnier soufflé for dessert.Prices were astoundingly high, especially for the wines, which were over $35 by the glass and an average of over $300 per bottle even excluding those in the thousands. I think this was over the top. Overall a very expensive experience ($450 for two including wine by the glass) but given the outstanding quality of the food and the service, worth it for a once-in-a-lifetime treat

We had dinner here tonight. The food actually was just okay nothing special. Service was good but mistakenly taking order of the cold angel hair pasta with caviar after being informed that I can't take truffles. However, they're kindly offered me a substitute which was the raw scallops. Quite tasty and fresh. Overall this restaurant was nice but can better. The sole as their special was nice but the serving was too big. The price quite too expensive for the food served

We found Gunther's randomly so did not have any knowledge of their level of cuisine.The dining room is dark and lovely and the service is rather formal. Food here is top quality and beautifully prepared and presented. The sole was delicious, and the grilled tuna nicely done. The specials for the evening are brought out and described, and thankfully, we inquired about the prices prior to ordering. This is an expensive place to dine. They have a large wine list and allowed us to taste before committing to a bottle.We were treated to a sampling of dessert treats, which was really nice

Had dinner here with my friend. The signboard can be done better- i had difficulty locating the venue because their signboard is black with dark brown words. In the late evening it is difficult to make out the words under dim street lighting. The food was excellent although the prices were very steep. The cold pasta was truly out of this world and the Dover sole was also very delicious. The dessert was sadly not up to expectation, the crepe was just average at best. Service was average for the price paid, I had to keep asking for a water refill. The waiters also kept interrupting us to explain dishes to us, this was a little annoying especially since we were more keen to catch up with each other than to have a food commentary.

That is my absolute favourite dish there! The very best cold angel hair pasta with Oscietra caviar.
The carpaccio Omi beef with crispy potato and the black truffle crispy egg are interesting.
Leave some space for the petit fours after the meal.
5
Love the cold angel hair & Wagyu beef it's really awesome! Like heaven💋💋😍😍😍 one of my fav restaurant!! Quiet , romantic, classy ... Lovely dinner
3
I thought the food was ok but the prices were crazy. One crableg for 125? Atmosphere was good though I felt like there was an aggressive push to up-sell.
5
Gunther's is a fantastic culinary experience. Top cuisine, built with the best ingredients and perfectly paired with fabulous wines. One clearly notices the influence of the chef's experience at l'Arpège, the famous 3-star restaurant in Paris. One of the finest places to dine in Singapore.

We had a spectacular lunch in the private dining room at Gunther's - the best meal I have had in Singapore with a lovely atmosphere, great service and stellar food. It was an 'omakase' experience as the choice of dishes was left to chef Gunther who served an outstanding menu, very attractively presented. Part of the magic was to let the ingredients, whether high end or more straightforward, speak for themselves with well judged saucing and accompaniments, and another part was the delightful juxtaposition of different elements. By the by, you should leave space for the bread, which is excellent, and also for the petit fours, which are very tempting with a coffee at the end of the repast. What did we eat ? A delicious but delicate plate of pasta with sea urchin was immediately followed by belly tuna, caviar and slivers of nori, both with intense flavours. Crunchy grilled Japanese cabbage with a fried quail egg and three sauces then provided a brilliant contrast as well as refreshing the palate ahead of the extraordinary next course of Alaskan king crab with black truffle shavings accompanied by cappelletti filled with Comte. A triumph ! Perfectly cooked and juicy crab, with so many different and exciting tastes on the plate, but everything nicely balanced. The second main was another eye opener - Brittany sole (shown whole before filleting) with some mushrooms, a few capers and tiny tomato pieces, and the thinnest potato gratin you will come across anywhere. Very, very satisfying. To end the feast we were treated to a signature dessert which is a re-invented apple pie with a side of rum and raisin ice cream. A wonderful suprise. The service throughout the meal was impeccable, and the staff were immediately responsive to odd queries (such as getting onto the wifi system). The wine list is extensive and has some very fine bottles with understandable prices to match but there are some more affordable options (around S$ 100 for a few of the whites for instance), and the sommelier is both knowledgeable and gives most helpful advice. (The beers are Stella Artois and Duivel.) Yes, eating at Gunther's will certainly cost you, especially if you indulge in some of the more expensive wines, but it's a great dining experience at the sort of level you would expect to find in a Michelin starred restaurant. Yummy

I took my husband here for his birthday. The restaurant has a nice ambience and the service was great. At the end of the meal, the waiter brought out a little ice-cream birthday cake which was a nice touch. Our starters were excellent - really tasty and the main course was good but not amazing. We shared a dessert which was also good, but not spectacular. Overall it was a nice experience but my biggest complaint is prices. It is extortionate! We spent $700 and that did not even include a bottle of wine - only a glass each. There are many other restaurants in Singapore serving better food at more reasonable prices. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend
5
This place has it all: great food, impeccable service, quiet atmosphere, good location.I ordered the tasting menu and wine pairings. Each course was fantastic. I had their signature starter, chilled angel hair pasta with caviar and black truffles. It was so good it brought tears to my eyes. I also had:grilled cabbage with Iberico hamvery fresh tuna sashimi with rice and a citrusy something a soup that was delicious but I can't recall in detailmelt-in-my-mouth wagyu beefchocolate lava cake with vanilla ice creamEvery dish was very good and also beautiful. And the bread! A tiny baguette that was better than many I had in Paris last summer.The wines were spot-on matches for the food. I had Bollinger champagne, a Pouilly Fuisse, a French Pinot Noir, a Chateauneuf de Pape and port. All lovely.Service was attentive and polite but never hovering or TOO friendly. Pacing was great...6 courses in about 3 hours. You can go faster if you want; I asked for a slow meal.The dining room is small--maybe 20 seats max--and understated. The tables are spaced nicely; I could only hear vague sounds rather than entire conversations from other diners.In addition to great meal service, the staff was butler-like in taking care of me. They brought me the WiFi code without my asking. When I started sneezing, tissues were brought to my table. They offered to hall a cab for me when I left.Go! This place is a gem

I recently went back to eat at Gunther's after quite a while and i have to say it seems to get better and better with time. Had their New Year's set menu and i have to say it was a great, great meal. From their famous angel hair pasta with caviar which is simply wonderful (this must be one of the best pasta dishes ever invented) to their Roasted Suckling Pig (I am Chinese and i have to say this westerner cooks roasted suckling pig better than the Chinese) this is simply one of the best dining experiences anywhere in Singapore. Quite pricey though but worth it once in a while. This place deserves Michelin Star

We had an out-of-town guest visit last weekend, and decided to take our friend to the tried-and-tested Gunther's for dinner. As always, their signature Cold angel hair pasta with oscietra caviar was exquisite and the highlight of our meal, and we ordered an individual serving each. My dining companions enjoyed their Parma ham with seasonal Japanese melon entree, and ordered the 21 days dry aged beef for two - with comments that the latter's standard was somewhat similar to Morton's. I had the seafood consommÃ©, which came with a generous serving of lobster and Sakura ebi, and the warm angel hair pasta with (more!) Sakura ebi, which was fine, although somewhat unremarkable after the wonderful cold caviar version we had earlier. I suppose it was all a matter of personal preference, as one of my companions shared some of the warm pasta I ordered, and rather enjoyed it. It was also a nice touch when, midway through our meal, Chef Gunther came out to enquire if we were enjoying our dining experience.We also ordered a cheese platter, chocolate fondant, a delightful apple tart with rum and raisin ice cream (which the server took the kind initiative of splitting three ways - it was far too massive for me to finish alone), and a bottle of amarone. We were so full that we did not have any of the complimentary petit fours served after the meal.The bill for the night was $900 for 3 persons, which I felt was a fair price to pay for good food and faultless service in a quiet and fairly private setting
3
We were treated to Gunthers on a visit to Singapore. This is clearly a FINE DINING experience. The service was clearly proud of their establishment and chef, but they seemed uncertain, which left it feeling unpolished. Perhaps they were unprepared for the scepticism that comes with not being necessarily accustomed to fawning over a menu. The dishes were very well cooked and the flavour and texture combinations were exquisite. I particularly enjoyed the pork chop with tempura vegetable highlights. The parade of ingredients for the specials was off putting when the king crab started waving at us in a manner of a drowning swimmer calling for assistance. The meals, even for a pork chop, was stratospheric
5
Really one of my favourite restaurants of all time. A must try is their cold angel hair pasta. Superb execution of what is seemingly a simple dish
5
Good service. The lunch formula is very valuable. Wine are a bit expensive, but they offer some old wines by the glass. Also try, for lunch the fresh market products.
5
Food was excellent..love the angel hair pasta and lobster with tomato sauce.
Service was great and staff was attentive.
Will be back again.
5
In a city full of choices Gunther's still stands out. We have been coming here over the years and it is still our family's favourite, testament to the constant high quality of food. Their signature cold angel hair pasta with caviar is a must try.
5
Food: When it first opened, the set lunches were a steal. With inflation over the last years, I'm not sure the set lunches are as good. That said, what you can order from the a la carte menu is usually quite good, and frequently the off menu items (there are many) are very good. Decor: Some find it quite cold, but I like it.Service: Sometimes erratic but definitely among the better ones in Singapore.Value: Subjective. On the basis that there are few commendable fine dining restaurants in Singapore, this is great value as it is noticeably cheaper than say Joel Robuchon. I find Gunthers to be great value
5
Gunther's is our go-to restaurant whenever we want to have excellent, expertly prepared fresh food in a classy but cosy ambience.During a recent visit in Aug 2015, my wife and I shared four dishes between us, including the restaurant's signature angel hair pasta and three specials of the day, all of which were excellent. The standout dish that day was the lobster which was perfectly grilled and served with a side of moreish, al-dente tomato rice. This is perhaps one of the most underrated restaurant in Singapore. We will be back for sure!
4
This was my 3rd meal there recently and every time it is different. I love the specials tray that comes out so you can choose dishes. You can also give input into how you would like them cooked. I have never had a request rejected. It is expensive but cheaper than a flight to Paris. Love :-
5
Always love Gunther's Modern French that has Asian Taste in it !Cold Pasta with Caviar & Truffle sauce is so fabulous & love the Suckling Pig.Great Rest but always Pricey but I guess that's what u pay for Quality Tasty & Consistent Cuisine

Since I went to this restaurant on a visit to Singapore, I can still remember the taste of what I had, and craving to go back to Singapore for Gunthet's.My sweet husband looked at the list of best restaurants in Singapore, and he found this on top of the list. Our birthdays are a day apart so he booked our special dinner here. He emailed them and got a confirmation on our booking.The restaurant ambience is quite muted, classy.The French maître-d' was very French and welcomed us at our table. He showed us the specials of the day, which meant fresh from the market ingredients. That night, this included lobsters, varieties of fish, lamb, white asparagus and truffles. And he made us smell the truffles. The truffles had a very subtle smell, I could hardly smell anything. And he explained where it came from in France, and that it's jelled mild and subtle. Quite different from other truffles.so they were that worked up on their ingredients. This theater preceded our ordering.We ordered half a bottle of white wine, and they obliged my preference for sweet white wine with a Hungarian wine.My husband had the white asparagus and they made it into their recommendation. I had a pumpkin soup with black truffle cream and sabayon as starter. The pumpkin soup came in the color of pumpkin with the foam on top. - and when I put my spoon in the rather small bowl, the fresh truffle cream, blackish underneath, was revealed. And oh, the taste! And I appreciated why it was not a lot- good food is really to be savor end, and I savored every bit of that soup.My husband ordered lamb, which was very good. I ordered a simple pasta from the menu, angel hair with Sakura shrimps. The French maître d asked me if I was having the pasta with dry shrimps. I said yes- he wanted to clarify if I knew what Sakura shrimps were. When my order arrived, i looked at it and was almost dismayed at what I ordered -dried shrimps indeed on orange-colored sauce on angel hair pasta. When I tasted it, after it cooled down a bit, it was another OH MY! the taste was awesome, very well-balanced with subtle hints of cilantro, curry. But it was so good! After entree, we were presented each with ice cream cakes, with candles to blow. They said that we mentioned it was our birthday and they had to do it for both of us. The dessert we ordered of orange soufflé was also very good and light.It was expensive. More because of the wine. But the food and experience was so worth it. Prepare to spend about Sing$ 200 each. But truly special. I will go back, for sure
3
The place itself interms of decoration and beauty is nothing special at all. You are for food and service only. Variety and freshness and quality are v good. Very old school in its presentation and really not for non business people. Atmosphere not jolly or fun. Selection of wines great but way to pricey. So all in all avoid unless you have fat expense account or want a splurge 
5
This sis still one of the best or the best restaurant in singapore. The angle hair caviar pasta is a must and the rest depends on what is in season
5
had a great experience, heavenly food; the chef and his personnel really outdid themselves !
if you want to sample some lovely food, Gunther's is the place to go !
5
I am French, have eaten in most 3* Michelin in France and this is really one of the best meal I had in my life. I went for the tasting menu, leaving to the Chef the choice of food and wine. I love the idea of not knowing what is coming and letting the Chef take me to heaven! and that's exactly what happened at Gunther's.The food was delicate, the portions right, it was all about the product - there was 1 hero on every dish and the rest of the ingredients were serving it - just the way it should always be.Wine was amazing as well.You could feel the team was happy to work there and had been at the restaurant for a long time.I don't understand the rating the restaurant got on Tripadvisor and would recommend it to anyone wanting an amazing culinary experience, not just a fancy meal

I have not written a review for some time. But every once in a while a restaurant comes along that really infuriates me. There are many things wrong with this overpriced restaurant:1. On arrival the first thing we encountered was plates being cleared at the lobby, Ie leftovers being scraped into a bin ready to go to the dishwasher... this should not be the first thing you see in a high end restaurant.2. The first thing the waiter asked was can I get you a glass of champagne without telling us what the champagne was etc, the upselliing pressure did not stop there.3. The "produce tray" contains items ranging from seafood, meat to dairy. This tray is brough to your table with water at the bottom of it as the ice has melted. This is neither hygienic or appetising. None of the items are priced, so when the waiter presses someone who orders the entrecote to upscale to the wagyu it doesn't make much sense. Further more I am not going to order a wagyu steak that has been sitting in water run off from a thawed fish!4. The waiters' outfits were not clean.5. The mensroom... I have been in public toilets cleaner than this.6. Upselling continued with the waiter suggesting truffles on everything. I finally indulged, when my steak came out it there was about 300g grams of truffle on there. This upsell showed up on the bill as an extra $75 for a dish that cost roughly the same to begin with. No one wants to eat that much truffle in one sitting.7. Overall the bill excluding wine and champagne, came to roughly $250pp. This is what you would expect to pay at a two Michelin Star plus restaurant in London or NY. Gunther's falls well short of the mark.8. Overall the restaurant interior design and furniture is shabby and feels relatively cheap, again not what you expect at these prices.9 One positive the sommelier was very good
4
Having been here many many times I can write a very balanced piece on this place. The food is good so don't get me wrong. The service is one of the better you will get in Singapore and if you are a regular you will be made to feel like it. The prices are not cheap and the wine list can make even a seasoned Singapore diner blush. It is worth nothing that you do both corkage ($70) or one for one here - but even the cheapest bottle of white is going to cost you mid 100's. Food wise you must order the house special (cold angel hair pasta with caviar) this you can't go wrong on. Other than that I would stick to ordering from the menu and away from the daily specials cart (unless you are either not paying or have a very healthy expense account ) as you could get a shock when the bill comes at the end of the night. Otherwise come for the lunch set meals. This is something that will give you good service and quality food at a reasonable price.
5
I have been a fan of Gunthers for years. What's not to like? The restaurant is a respite from the outside world & has an intimate, cocoon like atmosphere. The service staff are excellent and treat their guests very well. Chef himself is all affability and greets diners as if they are visiting his home. The food is excellent and well executed.Those seeking smoke and mirrors and new dishes with each visit will be disappointed however. Chef cooks those dishes for which he is known and may tweak some favorites but otherwise things will be consistent with each visit. My only grouse is that a) many of the choices on the set lunch menu come with additional charges and b) the seasonal dishes which are highlighted to diners are pricey (eg a recommendation of carpaccio of pen shell served with tiny dollops of caviar was a hefty SGD $140!) So be forewarned that a celebratory lunch or dinner for a special occasion may run into hundreds of dollars. But chosen wisely, a meal here will not necessarily break the bank

Went to Gunther for a birthday lunch. We ordered the lunch set menu (plus some extras as many dishes in the menu requires additional cost) .Service was good but the waiter was a bit insistent for us to get some a la carte dishes... As if his management had given them the instruction to try to add some "a la carte" specialities in addition to the lunch set menu supposedly affordable. Naturally, the food was ok but definitely not amazing. Good french food but I was expecting much better. Maybe the "A la carte" food is more impressive... But for an affordable lunch, I would definitely pick some other options - les amis for instance - rather than Gunther. Ps: we paid 230SGD for 2 lunch set menu (inclusive some additional cost for 2 dishes), some sparkling water and two glasses of Champaign. Not so affordable in the end...
3
Everyone raved about Gunther's so we made a point to go ther this trip to Singapore but ended up with slight disappointment. Yes it was very pricey we paid S$760 for two of us but the the food is not as "great" as everyone said. It was a Monday evening and it's quite emptied. We opened a half bottle wine. We both ordered the signature dish - cold Angel hair pasta with caviar - which was nice, tasty and well presented. Then followed by the seafood consomme, which was slightly over salt, and fresh scallop with generous portion of black truffle but somehow there was zero taste nor fragrant for the black truffle. Then followed by the tuna belly and roasted black pig, which were pretty average. The apple tart dessert was good. Overall the restaurant is nice, wine list is good, service was very good but the major problem and let down was the food. It was an experience but I do not think we will return
4
Was back in Singapore for a few days and decided to treat someone on a french dinner. Food was perfect but the wine was really too expensive, meaning there was no bottle below SGD 150 (Eur 100). Service was also perfect and we had a chat with the chef afterwards who turned out to also be a Belgian. So, would recommend this to all, but would recommend the chef to include some cheaper bottles of wine
1
Firstly, we arrived early at 6.45pm on a Monday, having had no time to make any bookings prior and hoping to get a seat nonetheless. Staff were having their briefing before the restaurant opened, noone tended to us for approximately 10 mins. We were then asked to take a seat at the bar with the intention of being served water or drinks, none of which came. We waited another 15 minutes for a table in the empty restaurant. We ordered mostly off the specials menu - the scallop with white truffle, wagyu carpaccio (only item off the normal menu), lamb rack and pigeon. The scallop was served cold even though it was supposed to be a warm dish, there was a quial egg that came with it, and this along with the dressing completely overwhelmed the delicate flavour of scallop such that the only feature if the scallop that stood out was its texture, you couldn't taste anything more. The helping of shaved white truffle was fairly generous, but even this was overwhelmed by the flavour of the egg and dressing. Scallops are my favourite food, I've eaten them on my travels across various continents. This is by far the worse scallop dish I've had, ever.The wagyu carpaccio was surpringly lovely, it came on a bed of thin, crispy potatoes. The dressing was light and flavourful without overshadowing the lovely flavour of beef. The crispy potatoes gave the dish a great crunchy element. My pigeon was overcooked, the flesh was chewy and lacked even the barest hint of seasoning. The dish is somewhat saved by the beautiful mushrooms and dressing that accompanied the pigeon. Shame that the main element of the dish was such a disappointment. I couldnt get to any part of the bird aside from the breast as every other portion was too hard to cut into, even with a steak knife. An absolute disappointment.My partner ordered the rack of lamb, which was cooked well, served on the same bed of gratin and mushrooms as the pigeon came with. The lamb was fine, well seasoned and cooked well, but nothing to sing about. None of the beautiful flavours or pairings you'd expect from a gourmet restaurant Gunter's claim to be.Certainly not like any fine dining options I have enjoyed before, aside from the ambiance, none of the flavours impressed, neither did the execution of the cooking of our meats. The only dish that was good was the carpaccio, which is by far the cheapest item we ordered, also keeping in mind that its a raw dish.Very lackluster food, exceedingly below all our expectations. Perhaps our mistake was to choose the specials over their signature dishes. That was $400 very poorly spent. I'm severely disappointed
5
Visited with friends, v good service, they got it, they understood out needs, great wine list, traditional menu with excellent produce which was v well executed. Very good place for a special occasion with a loved one, friends or to impress a client.
5
i booked having read reviews and was not disappointed. Fabulous, fabulous food with great staff. But save up your pennies.
5
Dining at Gunthers Place is a real treat! Formidable gastronomy and very friendly staff. Real compliments to boss and chef Gunther. We got the Chef's Table, a private room. Every dish was full of flavours. Do not miss the pasta with truffle and caviar. The Wagyu beef really melted in our mouths.We like to thank Gunther for the discovery menu served us at a very special price
5
I feel good Western food is hard to find in Singapore. A visiting friend wanted to try this restaurant. I have heard about it. The lunch set menu was amazing. We had the cod and the Wagyu beef. They had a few specials, and would bring the main ingredient whether alive or dead out for you to see. Service was great.I am definitely coming back here for dinner. Be advised that they do not allow children under 7
4
I have had the pleasure of eating here many times. The service is 2nd to none, the menu exquisite with some dishes I cannot ever miss if I am there. Ie the truffle & caviar angle hair pasta.I want to give it a 5, but I have given it a 4, purely based in that some of the prices are now getting extremely high so it's not a regular as it once was.If you like French food, It's a must try, but just be prepared to walk out heavier but lighter in the wallet.
5
~I'd never booked any of the restaurants on Purvis Street but it never fails to impress me when someone invites me to them, Gunther's is a treat from our boss Francis, who got us the Chef's Table, a private room because Gunther is his neighbour (yep bring out your chef neighbours if you have em') ~We took the degustation menu paired by Romeo (pronounced but not spelled) our sommelier... I think we had Champagne, Amarone, 2 whites, 3 reds !!!~Gunther had the White Truffles brought out OMG this is gonna get rich and we had a great mean I remember & recommend ~White Truffle soup with Sabayon always never too rich or much to start with~Cold Angel Hair Pasta with Oscietra Caviar simply the best dish you want MORE MUCH MORE but know you just had enough as much, it's like I can taste it writing this review~The really SUPER Charcoal Grilled Waygu Steak, so flat it seems like you can never get it medium rare but be surprised with the slice of corns makes for a balanced mouthful~Char-gilled Scallop overflowing with White Truffles (Gunther gave us a ton of shaves)~Crispy Egg with Bacon something that I would not have known to order, now I know different~The so thinly made Pear Tart with a scoop of Rum Raisin Ice Cream you can smell the rum off the spoon~You gotta grab that upside down crispy on the outside Petite Fours with a soft gooey texture centre that feels like a banana cake but not~Why the neighbourly chef matters? We're not exactly the upper crust of society, more like the normal folks you see shopping in the outskirts but service was impeccable and entertaining. Gunther said Romeo has a six pack and single that he'd introduced him to our repressed single lady in our group who felt him up and had a really good time chatting after the long long meal (4 hours)~I'd certainly recommend Gunther for fine dining and romance of the soul that matters when the heart is won :
5
Excellent French restaurant with top quality products which are shown to you so you can choose from, sophisticated yet simple dishes without unnecessary ornaments. Warm, elegant slightly dark atmosphere to enhance the plate and attentive and professional chef de salle, sommelier and staff.We ordered Truffle soup with pumpkin VeloutÃ© and sabayon, Roasted pork flank, coquille and pasta Harissa-style, Fillet of Perche Nantua sauce, Plateau of French farm cheeses, Valrhona's Manjari chocolate fondant and ice-cream and Fine apple tart, Havana rum raisin and vanilla ice-cream.Simply unbeatable, worth booking at this restaurant although, of course, the price is according to their quality

This is another restaurant week review, and a catching up session with another long-time-no-see friend *Dan. Gunthers French Restaurant is also another restaurant I have been wanting to visit for a while. This sophisticated and spacious restaurant rests at swanky Purvis Street, and indulges in soft, dim lightings. The decor is inspired by Art Nouveau, complete with tasteful branded furniture, combining art with affability and modern with vintage. My appetiser was the Crispy Egg with Pumpkin Coulis and Grilled Alsace Bacon. The bacon strip was tender but taste was bland. If I had wondered what a "crispy egg" was , this was it. The trims were crispy to a certain extent. The overall flavor of the dish was light, sweet and "breakfasty" in description. To be frank, rather nondescript.For my mains, I had the Roasted Carabinero Gambas with black ink rice and onion tempura. Basically, a very large deep-sea shrimp with sweet, bouncy meat served on a small bed of squid ink rice - tasty and redolent of seafood's scrumptious saccharine flavor. I had thought of skipping the onion tempuras - but it was sweet, crispy and devoid of the strong onion odor that put me off usually. I enjoyed my main - even the chewy, grainy black rice.*Dan had for his entree, the Charcoal Grilled Wagyu Steak, medium rare, served with sweetcorn and potato wedges on the side. His verdict was very good - tender, tasty, with everything done right. Well, it did look succulent anyhow.For full review and more photographs, please feel free to check out:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/11/lunch-at-gunthers-modern-french.htm

Restaurants in Singapore come and go, but Gunther's seems to have been around for a long time. While my wife's been here on many occasions, this was my first visit and it didn't disappoint. The interior is in the "tasteful and modern" category, lots of taupe and various other earth tones, and the atmosphere is good. Wasn't a full house on a Friday night, but that meant we could get a table at short notice, so no complaints there. The service was good, and the staff are capable of cracking a joke which I always appreciate.The food was generally excellent, and only one duff starter prevented this from being a five star review. My tenderloin was cooked to perfection, unusually served with delicious bone marrow, corn and sweet potato. The staff were also happy to accommodate my request for more bordelaise sauce, which was much appreciated. My wife's angel hair pasta with dried prawn and kombu had great depth of flavour, and the split portion dessert (apple tart with rum raisin ice cream) was still very substantial. The only misstep was the carpaccio of celeriac confit with Iberico ham. There wasn't enough of the ham to go around, and it was the only thing that lifted the flavour of an otherwise bland dish.Still, my impressions of this restaurant were still very positive, and I will most likely return
5
I've been going to Gunther's for about five years. I always have a great meal, and the service is warm and attentive. I usually opt for seafood for the main course. Presenting diners with a tray full of recommended ingredients is a great idea, and I find the fish and shellfish irresistible. I also love how flexible and accommodating they are about food preparation. They'll do it any way you want, or be mindful about what you don't like or can't eat. They aim to to give you a good meal to enjoy and they do. Today I had the dover sole. I didn't want a butter sauce, so they dressed it with pumpkin puree, balsamic vinegar reduction and other wonderful flavours. Happy
5
One of the best restaurant in Singapore. Great and very inventive food. But it is also not cheap especially if you go for the specials.
4
German name and French style food, great food, superb service and a wonderful place to eat and relax. On business and eating solo can be a challenge but not here. It is the best French eatery I have ever experienced in Singapore. Not hard to find and I recommend booking a table... there wasn't a single empty cover in the place. Excellent experience and will return to sample more.
5
Being our first time in Singapore, we had no idea what to expect. I had done a little research on Trip Advisor, & reviews were mixed/good.I chose this restaurant to celebrate our 20th Wedding anniversary, and it didn't disappoint.While a little loud, the seating is intimate enough & the service was outstanding.We shared an Entree of the Famous "Angel Hair Pasta with Caviar".... WOWMy wife is not a caviar fan, but loved it.For mains I had the Lobster Thermador & my wife had the Black Pig.... both sensational.Best Lobster I have had. The menu selections made it hard to choose a single dish.Dessert was a perfect Chocolate Souffle & the iconic French Crepes Suzette.... again ...WOW. While the dining experience was fantastic, what set this experience apart for us was Gunther.After the meals, he joined the table next to us for a drink. We all chatted for a while, then he recommended & wrote down other restaurant names for us to experience during our stay. Very helpful, very friendly..... Nice guy. While we went in blindly relying on internet feedback, this was the perfect restaurant to celebrate our anniversary dinner. We will return to Gunther"s

We are regular but not frequent patrons over the years. Yet, we never fail to recognise that service, ambience and food at Gunther's have remained consistently high. This is a great achievement in Singapore today. It's our go-to place for celebrations 'cos as everybody would appreciate, it's not just the food or service or ambience that makes a great dining experience but a serendipitous blend of all 3. For a fine dining restaurant, prices are not low but then again eating out in Singapore is expensive compared to many other countries as food is imported, and rentals and wages/salaries are high. Standout dishes for us include the very fresh or live seafood, the cold angel hair pasta with caviar, and the French chicken. We tend to skip fish as we eat fish almost daily. Gunther's offers a daily set lunch of $38++ daily including Saturdays. This is great when opting for fine dining with a strict budget. Note also, that Gunther's is very attuned to our Asian preference for sharing - so it's possible to share for example, a few large oysters (large enough to cut into 3 pieces) and pen shells with everything elegantly and individually plated

Went to this highly recommended ( don't know by friend or foe after I saw the bill) French Eatery tucked into the wall at Purvis street in singapore which you can easily miss so concentrate when you reach Purvis street so you don't take a second round in the taxi ;) We ordered a 6 course meal starting with Cold angel hair pasta with Oscietra caviar which was perfect !!! Next came the Asparagus with Wild mushroom which was very fresh, subtle, and with a hint of herbs …… this was followed by the scallop carpaccio which came with olive oil and a sprinkling of truffle and seasonal garnish which was fantastic but the portion was quite skimpy …… this was followed by the roast smoked foie gras with mousseline of green apple again again very very good, next came my favorite the wagyu beef with 8.5 marbling which really hit the spot ….. the dessert was a highly recommended apple crumble with a vanilla ice cream which was quite a let down after such a great medley of hits!!! Well you can't get everything perfect but definitely go and try a different dessert there were a few other options but we went with the recommendation ….. only last comment is when the cheque came it was quite a bit more than we had expected !!

Absolutely the best French cuisine I have experienced in Asia. The place was recommended by the concierge at our hotel, as we asked for last minute reservation this was the only place available on a friday night, so we were a bit sceptical, but that was totally unnecessary, the restaurant was top class. Tucked in a small side street behind the icon Raffles hotel the restaurant is in a shop house, has very simple but classy setting. The staff is very attentive. The food is just outstanding, the chef is extremely good and creative, the way he has blended some of the local flavours into the french cooking style elevates the food to a different level. The angel hair pasta with caviar, the special japanase fish which melts in your mouth or the foie gras preparation are all unique and absolutely the best. I would rate this the top in Singapore compared to some of the so call michelin starred restaurants where I have had in the past..

I tried it for the first time today at for an important business dinner and I was very happy. The service was top notch, attentive, professional and with that perfect balance between anticipating needs and staying in the background. The food was very good, modern yet light and innovative. It certainly wasn't cheap but I'll be coming back
5
They had the best angel hair pasta, the aroma of truffles and caviar, just made this dish super yummy. Besides that, Gunther's has a wide array of fresh seafood or meat, all introduced to you by their waiter on how they do it. I had scallops the last time, placed on their shell still, with a small egg, might be quail, extreme delicious too. Their wagyu beef is done perfectly with that umami taste. Each and every trip here , made it worthwhile though they are quite expensive
5
First time visit thru friend's recommendation. The Chef really put in much effort into the food presentation and you can tell that fresh ingredients are use. Taste wise I cannot fault the food that I ordered. All of us agreed that the food that were serve to us all taste great. Service was very professional. Most service member were knowledgeable and they would gladly help you with your questions and also personal. That what I really like. I notice that most of our time there, there this particular waiter to take care of us. I would recommend this restaurant for great food and professional service especially for special occasion, corporate, business luncheon and be prepare to spend
4
Who would have thought that a dish of cold angel hair pasta would be one worth a plane ride? Gunther's is in Purvis Street, not far from the famed Raffles hotel, and its signature dish of the pasta with caviar and truffle oil is absolutely extraordinary. Everything's executed very well here and try to save room for a dessert - various souffles are on offer every night and the chef's take on apple pie is exceptional. Not cheap but a very good experience
5
Outstanding food and service. Excellent menu with many options to choose from. The staff were friendly, knowledgable, and very professional. This was our first time dining at Gunther's and the restaurant exceeded our expectations! A must place to dine!! Marty & Hyewon.
5
I commented on this restaurant before, and it has been one of my favorites. I went this time for lunch and had the set menu. I highly recommend this as it is good value.
5
We had a fantastic time at Gunther's restaurant. You know you're in for a treat from the moment you step inside. The waiters are efficient, knowledgeable and extremely professional. When it comes to the food, Gunther's only uses the freshest most exclusive ingredients available and it makes a BIG difference. I highly recommend you sprinkle black truffle on the Wagu beef starter-- Worth the extra $$$. The angel hair pasta is absolutely divine with a side of seafood. Treat yourself to a crepe Suzette for dessert: Fantastique! My only critique would be the lighting ( too bright ) & the standard of the washroom facilities  All in all, I give Gunther's a solid 9
4
You could taste that the food uses only the best ingredients. From the cheese to the banana cake to the steak, all had pleasantly rich flavours. The service was attentive and very professional. The waiters noted our requests and responded promptly. Gunther's is a fine dining restaurant I would recommend for business meeting in which you need to impress your superiors or business partners

I hadnt read any reviews here .. I just googled for best restaurants singapore and found this restaurant what a disappointment .. the greeting was very nice the service was good the food was delicious but no ambiance at all it felt like we were eating in a bus station all the servers going past to the private dining room ... constantly and the noise from the kitchen and clearers I I didnt want to be part of the banquet but thats what it felt like, even having a waiter bunp into the table .. the music was faintly playing but the noise I heard was the kitchen and wait staff clearing .. I felt that the main purpose here was to sell you the most expensive item whether or not it was good .. I like to be shown the best item to eat .. so a pleasant experience food wise but would not go back or recommen

Do NOT order anything that's not priced on the menu. The "specials" are totally overpriced and they will push them, even when you're ordering a menu item. Several dishes listed on the menu are suddenly "not available today" and the proposed alternatives will cost you an arm and a leg. The food and service itself was "good" but not exceptional and certainly not worth the money paid.
5
Let me get this out of the way before anything else. Do not expect the meal to be cheap because it won't be. But you are sure to get value for your money.My husband enjoyed everything that we ordered although I may have ordered too much I was unable to eat any dessert at all. We started with some sort of cheese that I cannot recall but I'm pretty sure my husband still remembers followed by the blue lobster from France and the Angel Hair Pasta with caviar. For dessert my husband had the Orange Soufflé. I liked how the quality of the food showed in your plate when they give it to you although the preparation time is longer than usual.The ambiance is cozy and elegant. The servers were attentive and they know what they were serving.I do not mind coming back despite the price of everything we consumed
3
I choose "average" for the overall review, because my husband rates the restaurant "very good" and I would give "poor".The difference of our votings lies in the preparation of the main dish (Wagyu). When the meat arrived the waiter announced one with "welldone" and tried to place it in front of me. I denied having ordered this kind of quality (I adore rare and hate welldone) - to be honest I ordered nothing special becaus I was not asked !!! - and they went back in the kitchen. Only a few seconds later they came back and placed the plate in front of me and told me: "Welldone - for you." I was speechless, but tried to cut a piece out of the meat anyhow (you never know...), but failed, because it was uncuttable. I asked the waiter to put the plate back in the kitchen, because I was not able to eat something like that. He did and minutes later another meat was arriving (in medium quality) which was good.I asked the sommelier (a French guy) if he would eat a Wagyu welldone and he said: "Never !" So I asked him why I got something like that and he answered that the chef decided to prepare it like that for me ! I received no answer.I have two explanations (both not very pleasant) why I received a quality like that- the meat was overcooked and they thought some silly European woman might not protest- the chef thought that a woman will like welldone meatAnyhow the other food was excellent and it was a nice evening (after I managed to oppress my anger...).But: the price is ridiculous and after the experience I won´t be back (so my husband will have to go alone next time), even though the atmosphere is really nice for a dinner out with you loved one

Entering Gunter's I was greeted warmly and shown to my table. I was then presented with an array of the menu ingredients and the specials of the day at which time I advised the server that I don't eat seafood. The same server took my order and recommended the house special of cold angel hair pasta with caviar- to which I reminded him that I don't eat seafood and so caviar is not an option. By this time I would think the fact that I don't eat seafood would be clear...wrong! I was presented with an amuse bouche of tempura prawn. I of course did not touch it and I then proceed to sit there for a very uncomfortable 15 mins until my cocktail arrived at which time I asked for the prawn to be taken away because I don't eat seafood. I had not ordered an entree so it was straight to the main, the special of the day a lamb dish,or so I was told.It perhaps would have been best to describe it as 5 pieces of 2cm x 2cm fat attached to 2cm x 2cm lamb. Coming from Australia where lamb is in abundance I appreciate that I may be a little spoilt where lamb is concerned because the cut of meat is the highest standard, but if this dish were served in Australia it would bd sent back before the plate hit the table. The next let down was the dessert, filo pastry with apple filling- nothing spectacular. What made my dismal meal worse was receiving the bill and realising that the pathetic lamb dish cost $95 plus tax and service charge. Not impressed. Would never visit agai

Celebrated a friends birthday there. We asked for the degustation menu and were asked to choose $180, $200 , $220, $250, $300 without telling us what would be the diff besides the price.. Also , thought it was a little weird to have different menu at only $20 difference. Why do they bother to make so many types for fine dining. Perhaps it would be easier to decide based on no. of courses and some explanation on the difference, courses or quality ?? Anyhow, we settled with the $200 which we later realized was 7 courses including dessert .Amuse bouche - fried prawns..1) cold cappellini with caviar - strong truffle oil fragrance and good cappellini texture -good2) mini clams - clams burst with flavour of sea but only 6 mini ones which are as big as a one cent coin - Good .. but they were so tiny and precious (I have only 5 cos one clam was not opened) that I had a hard time trying to register the taste before they all disappear. 3) crab risotto - fresh and juicy crab meat, but risotto was a little overcooked - good4) foe gras- nice aroma but not melt in mouth texture -ok5) fried egg with interesting sauce - good 6) lamb chop - good tender lamb - good 7) plain chocolate soufflé - .. the truth is, the puffed up souffle looked quite nice but it is totally bland and tasted as plain as it looks, and it is something most restaurants and average cafeteria can churn up easily. Poor ending to an otherwise great meal ;disappointing...After the entire meal , we felt the courses were kind of heavy, it was short of some refreshing elements and vegetables. The chef may need to review their choice of courses. It was made worse with the butter-loaded petit four.. , canale and mini financiers . Anyhow with the few shortcomings , i still think the food , minus dessert , was great on a whole, they were well concocted and was done with much sincerity and passion. Portions were on the small side but they were compensated with the continuous supply of freshly baked mini baguette

Simply outstanding. Best food I ever ate and very friendly staff. We took the menu and let the Chef surprise us. each dish was superb and a splurge of flavors. The deserts were exquisite. We will definately be back and recommend this place
5
Fantastic food.. It was really great and enjoyable. Grilled prawns were exquisite. Scallops were succulent. The white truffle pasta was out of this world. Suckling pig was ok, nothing great. Sea bass from Britanny was real nice. We rounded off with the Crepe soufflé.
5
Went here for special anniversary dinner. Not cheap, but very worthwhile. Felt very appreciated as a customer. Food was delicious, and staff was very willing to entertain special requests or changes to the offered menu items.
4
How sad to find such a superlative kitchen let down but a hostile greeter and dreary ambience.someone needs to tell the chef grey and black do not equal fun!sensational food with crispy coated foie gras and fresh Maine lobster really unequalled anywhere in town.you just want to get a decorator in and brighten the place up.maybe then the staff would enjoy working there more too
5
I had the pleasure to lunch here and it confirmed that this is one of the best French restaurant in Singapore. I agreed is honest from the heart. Set lunch is S$38++ which is very good value for such high caliber restaurant. A la cart is very expensive but shall be justifiable base on the food quality, ambient and service
5
I was looking around for a Michelin star restaurant in Singapore and after researching, I opted for Gunther's. I'm glad I did. It was for a special birthday dinner and made early preparation with the restaurant. The food was phenomenal. I still remember the taste of the tempura prawn. It was lightly gathered on the outside and inside, the prawn was sashimi grade. Amazing! Also, we don't consume meat or alcohol and the restaurant was sensitive to our needs. For seafood selection, they will show case their seafood on a silver tray, literally! And beware, the seafood are so fresh that one might give you a wink! This place is totally worth it! They made our birthday dinner a memorable one. I am glad I chose Gunther's. a big winner in my book
4
My buddy paid so I didn't feel the pain too much but for the tasting menu with a bottle of wine I estimate that this was over S$500 for two. It pretty much delivered on quality though. The starter of spaghetti with caviar was very, very good. After that I remember a nice sea urchin dish, good lamb and interesting desserts (a sort of thin tarte tatin was OK). For this sort of money the quality wasn't out of this world. Nonetheless a pretty nice evening, in a French environment in Asia (which for an expat is rare), with a very memorable opening spaghetti dish
5
We flew in all the way to Singapore for my birthday dinner at Gunther's.The excellent reviews for the food here is certainly well deserved!My husband indulged us with several courses of Saturday's specials. One of our best friends' gauge for magnificent food is whether one can actually remember it and in this case we indeed can.We had sea urchin on cold angel hair pasta with winter truffle and caviar. The chef indulged us for our request to add in that winter truffle. Truly memorable!Next we had Spanish Gambas with tomato risotto. Quite a delight.We then had oysters before ordering individual mains - I had crab leg with artichokes. Thumbs up!The rest of my company had their lamb ribs, wagyu steak with bone marrow and lobsters - all fabulously cooked and served.The crepe Suzette's and the fine apple tart a la dragees with the Havana rum ice-cream (which we shamelessly asked for an individual scoop each!) are also the must-try here. And of course the bread served must be commended as well.Apart from the cocktails, which sadly they didn't do very well, we were utterly satisfied with the food and the service
4
enjoy the cosy atmosphere during lunch. At around sgd 38++ for the lunch menu; it's not a bargain, but the good service and location make up for it.Loved the nice crunchy bread. . Rather small portions...but then again ideal if you have to get back to work.Unfortunately the wines by the glass are outrageously expensive. .so had to skip it. How about a wine of the day...Overall a nice experience, but still prefer the place next door
4
We've been many times to Gunthers and it never disappoints other than when you get the bill. Everything is first class but you truly have to question whether it is worth the money. I truly struggled with the wine list today, on the Burgundy Red selection, I could count only 3 wines priced below $450. We're not cheapskates but that is beginning to step on.Everything is immaculate and we had a wonderful time but $2,400 for a 4 person business lunch, ouch! Go, be impressed but see the bank manager for a loan prior
4
Went for lunch. Set menu was good (a la carte is available too). Food was good, service excellent. All in all lunch is a good way to experience the place (albeit the portions are quite small).... dinner would be a lot more expensive.
3
Normally price is not an issue for me as you can't put a price on exceptional food. However Gunthers seems to put a very high price on mediocrity. This is one of the most expensive meals I've had in singapore putting it on the stage with Guy Savoie and Joel Roblochon unfortunately its not in the same class. The Maitre d' was the highlight of the evening he was attentive and personable providing interest it what otherwise would have been an uninspiring night. My dish with morels left me with a mouthful of grit. Totally unacceptable for a restaurant aspiring to fine dining. Worse still we had to ask for the dish to be removed from the bill, this should have been done as soon as we informed them. For a chef who allegedly trained with Alain Passard he clearly has a lot to learn about vegetables. The white asparagus was chewy and stringy and lacking flavour. The summer truffles which ordinarily have a delicate but wonderful flavour were about as tasty as cardboard. I always prefer to support passionate and talented less renowned chefs but in singapore if you want to spend this kind of money on dinner go with the big guns who lend their names to outlets here. Did I mention that the wine list is grossly over priceditvmade my eyes water to see the prices of some wines I have in my collection which I also know are sold for significantly less at other establishments. I believe the whole experience was over priced and over rated the only item that came anywhere close to expectations was the grand Marnier souffle. Another Daly dissapointing gastronomic experience in Singapore
1
The average meal price for a main course in the menu was S$70. When invited to order from 'today's specials' the price per serving was S$150 without prior advice by the waiter or Manager. The wine list commences at S$150 per bottle and you may have the good fortune to share this experience with children. I gave the restaurant two opportunities to contact me however my calls remain unanswered.I certainly would not recommend this restaurant unless you had an unlimited budget and even that would be irresponsible
5
A few of us had the set lunch on Saturday 33 Singapore dollars, you got one of three appetizers, one of three main courses, a dessert, coffee or tea. It was a good bargain relatively speaking.We also had the a la carte and this was more expensive.The angel hair with caviar was very good. We had two scallop cappacio to share among three of us. The scallop was very tasty.We also had the Spanish red prawn with tomato rice. This was extremely good.Yes, it was expensive. But you expected Gunthers to be expensive so it should not come as a surprise 
4
The Restaurant is located in a very inconspicuous street right next to Raffels Hotel.The food was amazing starting from the appetizer to the dessert. The only thing to complain is that there was no wine below 400$ on the list. Of course it is a luxury restaurant, but I find it slightly exaggerated.The Restaurant is furnished tastefully, maybe a bit dark, and I appreciated the generous free-space between the tables.I highly recommend everyone which enjoys gourmet-dinners to visit this place
5
Every once in a while you get an evening where everything comes together nicely for a faultless dinner. Excellent service from a super attentive server who made sure we did not miss out on anything from introducing the menu, to the excellent wine recommendations from Gunther's manager and resident expert, to a personal stop-by from the chef extraordinaire himself, all made for a wonderful evening. The very fresh and very alive seafood specials for the evening made for tough decisions but our server for the evening took care of this problem by allowing us shared taster portions of the not-to-be missed cold angel hair pasta with caviar allowing us to pick our special starters and our choices for the mains without guilt! It was all good!!! If you haven't already made your way to Gunther's, don't procrastinate any longer, do it
4
Came here for lunch and both the server and i knew exactly what i wanted to have - the lunch set with an extra order of their house special, the cold angel hair pasta with caviar, haService was good and attentive, filling up our water glasses in a timely fashion. Their house wines by the glass didn't catch my eye so we skipped that. The bread was good. I was surprised there was no amuse bouche for such a high end restaurantThe cold pasta arrived and was expectedly delightful. Our lunch set starters were a prawn cocktail and my friend had the scrambled egg with smoked salmon. He seemed to like it and it was a big portion. My prawns however were tiny and chopped into smaller piecesOur main of pork rib was well done. Dessert was a small half portion of a panna cotta - like dessert. It was my friend's birthday and they took out another ice cream cake dessert with a candle. Tea and coffee was single portion only and the petit fours were ok, also small portionsOverall not 3 michelin star wow, but good enoug
5
Fine dining is all about details from the chief.I would say Gunther's got it.We are lucky to get out table on e 2013 restaurant week.no complains even it is just lunch.Start off with the cold angel hair pasta.I love the details that the chief's dedication for the pasta with chilled plate.While you eat, you can see the moist on the plate which is like the morning dew and with a taste of summer from the cherry tomato and iberio ham.15-dollar-discounted foie gras.Totally a STEAL!!!so far it is the most impressive foie gras I ever had.it is crispy at the side and bottom.texture is almost like a thin layer of biscuit.Yet the meat is well done and not over cooked.Clever choice served it with lemonade n slight honey ( I guess).Pork ribs are divine as well.Tender yet not too bony.Beyond words.Of coz we love the 4 petite pastries.3 tiny pastries and 1 dark chocolate.yummy!With a choice of tea or coffee.Chief has excellent eyes in finding the right ingredient to put this meal together.Applause
4
We visited with a couple friend of ours during the Singapore restaurant week.The starter which was angel hair pasta with very tasty tomato and mozzarella was devine with a touch of truffle oil. This was followed by grilled tenderloin which was very tasty and succulent. The best part was that if you buy a bottle of champagne or wine they will waive the corkage for your bottle.The atmosphere was very mixed we had a big table celebrating a birthday, a table with their very young children and many couples.The service was attentive without being intrusive. I would go back again
5
Excellent food and service. The layout of the restaurant is interesting, segmented so that it's not noisy even though you are seated fairly close, still one is able to have a conversation without feeling like u need to shout. They have quite a lot of specials, it's very worthwhile to hear and ask about them, we ended up having 4 courses half from the menu, half specials. The angle hair pasta with carvier is excellent, it's their signature dish for good reason, the milk fed lamb out of this world! So tender, juicy... Perfect! Tenderloin was very very good. Usually I'm a little disappointed with beef/steaks in restaurants but not this one.mit was done perfectly and was simple but very tender and tender. We also had the white asparagus with truffle and razor clams with truffle. The dessert I had - e apple tart with rum and raisin ice cream was yummy, and not flaky, which I liked a lot. Also had melon with Spanish ham, that was a pedestrian comparedmtomthe rest of the excellent dishes. Service was fabulous. Staff were knowledgeable and friendly, so we got good advise and recommendations (wine too). And they will split a dish up into smaller portions for you to share so you get to try more! I didn't feel they came around too much, but what I loved was that they made us feel like old customers even though it was our first time there. Had a great dinner, they came wi a slice of fruit ice cream cake because it was a birthday dinner. Nice little touch. Would definitely go back again! Wanna try the squid dish that was a special, it sounded so good. But we had to choose, only have so much space before I'd have to roll myself out. Oh and they have free valet parking
5
I had the opportunity to have diner once at Gunther's.
Foie Gras, Chateaubriand steak, amazing cheese and wine.
About $S 600 pour 2 pax but worth it!
5
three visits in 2 months, some of the best dishes, angel hair pasta with caviar and the hot uni were both outstanding, some of the best dishes i have ever had
4
been here twice wthin a month, once for lunch and once for dinner. fantastic food, every dish is sumptuos, and just the right amount. pricey ala carte but more affordable set menu. nothing to rave about the plain decor. the service is good, though our server was a little forgetful.must try:wagyu beef carpaccio, angel hair pasta, iberico pork, tomato rice, choc fondantwill def go again for other dishes
5
Gunther's is simply amazing, a hidden gem.. Reservation is easy and efficient, they get back to you promptly. The atmosphere and decor is calm and lush. The wait staff are efficient, friendly and knowledgeable. They had the same menu when I went both times (few months apart) but I think this is the norm for most of the fine dining restaurants in Singapore (they tend not to change their menu as much as in Western countries), however, Gunther's has a daily special "cart" which they bring out and show you and explain how everything will be prepared/cook. Really nice and gives that something extra/special if you dine there a lot. Price-wise, it is not as expensive as others such as Guy Savoy and Joel Robuchon but EVERY BIT AS GOOD. I love it, it is my favourite fine dining restaurant in Singapore at the moment and I'll be going back there again the next time I return to Singapore. Food is delicious, simply prepared and let's the ingredients speak for themselves, not over-complicated, just the way I like it. One tip - make sure you ask how much the special dishes on the cart are if you are worried about your budget. I find that the the wagyu beef in Singapore (everywhere) is SUPER expensive as they get it from Australia
5
the whole experience was fantastic. from the ambience to the tableside romance to the chef coming out to say hi. the oysters were amazing, making me visualise the sea and shucking the oyster on board a ship. the lamb was superbly done, with the crispiness of the skin making it truly memorable. pricey but highly recommended
4
I took my dad there for a special occasion. I though the place had great service, great wine selection, and excellent food. Every dish was excellent, in particular their spaghetti caviar. My dad, being in a special mood and the waiter being such a good ales, ordered their ‘surprise menu’ – that is you won’t know what you order until it arrives on the table – which was a mistake. My dad found the food to be too greasy, and this menu turned out to be the most expensive. But except for this surprise menu, everything else was great
4
Had the set lunch with a friend for $38. The entree beef carpaccio was good, whilst the linguini seafood was superb withgreat texture and taste(more italian than french perhaps). The service was attentive, and timing was good as we had 3 course meal plus coffee in under one and half hour. Overall excellent value and recommended. I had heard that Gunthers has slipped somewhat in ratings since several years back; personally, I found dining there a highly satisfying experience. One minor complaint is the auto side door from the service areas was a distraction given the compact size of the roo

My husband picked this restaurant to celebrate our anniversary. We were warned by many of the high price but decided to give it a try. We have the set menu for $128++. After much warning, we decided to stick to just his set menu and not be persuaded to add any extra dishes from the market price items. This is the right decision if you do not want to over spent. Being a regular fine dinning person, I would said the food is very good and worth a try. However i will not pay more than us$200 per head for the experience. The wine list is quite high price. avoid it if you can. The presentation for the food is simple but well presented. We highly recommend the cold angel hair pasta with oscietra caviar and the cocotte of French chicken in hay. The rest in the set menu are good but not outstanding. The apple tart and raisin ice cream are also very good. The food portion is small but is enough for the night. Coffee is good but petit fours are so so. As a whole we had an enjoyable night with the bill of ~S$ 400 for two
4
Gunthers is considered one of the top restaurants in Singapore. A understated experience - from the entry. As we were a fairly large group, we had arranged beforehand for a tasting menu to be served... stunning combinations, perfect portioning, and flavour, flavour, flavour. The wine list is a mountain to climb, and the sommelier was not as forthcoming as he should have been with comfortable assistance - but we managed to navigate somehow (I am deducting a point for this). On departure, we were gifted with some lovely petit fours, which was perfect for remembering our lovely experience
2
fantastic service! really one of the top of singapore. food...better skip! this is good only for who really got no clue about french cuisine: it's a mix of something, hide behind the words "modern french cuisine"...if using ravioli, tagliatelle, n'duja and ricotta cheese is a modern french cuisine then the chicken rice can be defined as a delicacy...after spending all this money will be nice to see the chef coming on the table, but he never did. no problem, this kind of place not gonna see me anymore. unfortunately i say, because the service is top in town. food less then average, probably the most overpriced restaurant of singapore
5
Had a lunch celebration with my wife and the service was excellent. The Chef's personal attention was truly appreciated and recognized as the key reason for it to be one of the best restaurant in Singapore.
5
My wife and I visit Gunther's 3-4 times a year and the consistency of the food and service is highly impressive - plus the fact that Chef Gunther himself always seems to be there in the kitchen standing behind his food, unlike some of the other well known Singapore based chefs.The decor of the restaurant is understated but it is nevertheless elegant and refined. The service is polished and consistent but also welcoming and friendly - Manager Alex and his team do a great job and we have generally have never had reason to disappointed by the service.But obviously what keeps us coming back is the food! The written menu itself doesn't seem to have changed for a while but the dishes are all good with the Caviar capellini, lobster thermidor and chef's apple tarte worth a special mention - frankly the apple tarte alone keeps me coming back!Plus they always have a tray of daily special ingredients which can be prepared in a number of ways and shared and its this level of flexibility and personalisation of the menu which I particularly appreciate. I acknowledge some of the other reviews that these specials can be expensive but this is a top flight restaurant in an expensive city so what do you expect!The wine selection is good and the selection by the glass is both high quality and reasonably well priced - with the same caveat as the food - ie. this is top flight restaurant so it is expensive. Overall though I'd happily dine at Gunther's over many of the other fine dining choices in Singapore
2
We have been to Gunther's four times now with the same friends and the three previous times we went we came away thinking it was very expensive, but worth the "special treat" because the food was excellent. This was not the case with this recent visit and we will not return as it has reached the point when I feel they are consciously ripping you off and their quality has deteriorated as well. The bill the previous times was around $1200 for four of us and this time it jumped from $1200 to $1850 which was ridiculous. They do the normal of selling their specials but do not disclose the prices and actually charge a ridiculous amount. I had to send back my main course because it was overcooked - granted they replaced immediately and the replacement was excellent, but there was no apology and really I should not have to eat alone because it has been overcooked when you are paying these kind of prices. The cheese platter has also been reduced and is no longer impressive, but the pricing has not changed, so beware of this if you are a repeat visitor. So to my summary point - restaurants need to understand the tipping point of when customers will not return and not resort to ripping people off - perhaps they dont care if they become a one visit restaurant, I suspect so as I did send them an email with my feedback and never got a response. Singapore has too many good restaurants to return to one when you dont think you are getting value and quality for the money spent and we already though $1200 was a fortune, so to go to $1850 was unacceptable

Singapore is one those cities that appears to have many good dining spots but unfortunately in reality, I am often met with disappointing service, meal and/or value. In this rare occasion, I found a rare gem (by Singapore's standard) in Gunther's. It was my husband's birthday and our wedding anniversary and I chanced upon reviews on Gunther's. The menu looked great, the reviews though mixed was veered towards positive. The positive experience starts with our email correspondence since I am residing overseas. The staff Yuliz was polite, prompt and projected a keen sense of hospitality service with care to details and apt questions for the night arrangements. I had enquired about flowers to be left at the restaurant and was told it could be dropped off anytime as there will always be someone around. I was not disappointed on the actual day itself. Starting with service.It was rainy night and there were staff awaiting in the rain with brollies to meet their guest alighting from the cabs. Brownie points for that. After being warmly greeted, we were promptly seated in as quiet corner as possible as per requested. The flowers were swiftly brought out as per arranged and that was a nice "opening" to the night.The dinner specials of the night was introduced to us once we were nicely settled down. Jit (I hope I gotten the name right) was warm and friendly, and patiently went through the list with us. He was non-pushy, affable and knows the menu list, the food prep and description of the dish was thorough. Before leaving us to think through our main and starter "choice", he left us with the option of possibly a choice of letting him suggest our dinner options should we be overly spoilt for choice. Everything sounded yummy!In the end, knowing our goal was seafood and my husband was keen on the fresh lobster, he suggested the signature cold angel hair pasta with cavier, a shared pen shell starter for two, and a shared lobster thermidor. Whilst I was also gunning for the freshly oven baked meat, Jit was wise to tell me to hold that order, finish my lobster and see how I feel like later. He was right, I was truly too full to proceed on after my lobster main.Food reviewI am usually not a big fan on cold starters but the Cold angel hair pasta with Oscietra caviar was delightfully light and refreshing. On hindsight, I should have ordered one plate to share so that I could get another starter since the pasta was a good size portion. However we liked it so it's ok. The pasta had good consistency and texture and the flavor was definitely did not overwhelm, leaving our tastebuds nicely ready to sample the next dish.The penshell with seafood consomme was another delight though I must admit the prawns in the consomme had a richer sweet flavor as compared to the actual shell meat. Everything was cooked right but some may expect a lighter broth version than what we had. However, the taste was just right for me and again, good portion size.Our main was lobster thermidor and we had half each. I didnt think I would be full but I was wrong. By the time I was through, we were both very satisfied and this is the first time that I didnt want any more dessert. The lobster was fresh and succulent, nicely cooked such that it wasnt chewy yet retaining the full seafood flavor as any good chef worth their salt should with this dish. The pairing with the porcini mushroom was an excellent touch as it definitely enhanced the overall flavor for the dish and accentuate the lobster's flavor up a notch. The accompanying nice seemed to have a touch of lemongrass or something herby at least, and my partner loves it. By dessert time, I was struggling to decide. I didnt need more food but I had to since I was expecting the "Happy Birthday" candle moment. Between the apple tart, suze crepe and choc fondant, I was lost. My man wanted the crepe and I was trying to figure out how does one stick a candle on a crepe and so I forced myself to tell Jit to throw in the Choc fondant.However what came next was a complete surprise. We were presented with a nice complimentary frozen fruit ice-cream like cake with a candle to boot! When all the birthday wishes and camera shots were done, Jit came to us and told us ever so kindly that he had actually not logged in our dessert order as he knew we are almost full. but he didnt want to ruin the surprise and so he still pretended to take our dessert order. I was grateful for his initiatives and consideration and gladly cancelled our dessert order since the complimentary cake was not only enough, but it was actually the type of cold dessert we were craving for:)When we left, everything was in order. We were warmly given the birthday and happy anniversary greeting once more to round up the lovely night. One of the staff even chased after us just as we were boarding a cab, as my very contented satisfied birthday man had forgotten his birthday card left on the table.Overall, we couldnt be more satisfied with the service and food. The bill came up to about SG$400, inclusive of a glass of dessert wine. To us, it was good value enough. Definitely infinitely better than the mediocre Ku De Ta meal we had earlier at MBS for the same price, even surpassing our experience at some of the Michelin places in Hong Kong.Simple Honest Good Food. The chef has lived up to his vision and provided a food fare worthy of praise. This is one restaurant I would definitely look forward to returning to.Tip:-Might be wise to come earlier so that you get the best pick of the specials since it's limited item.- If you have special dietary requirements or allergies, best to remind server or inform during reservation as I recalled they did not reconfirm on any allergies precaution necessary to note during orders

Was in Singapore with my wife celebrating our wedding anniversary and decided to splurge on fine-dining. Gunther's seems to be recommended so we decided to try it. From their website, the degustation menu was only S$128 which seemed reasonable value compared to other restaurants in Singapore.After upgrading my wife's main to wagyu beef, ordering a glass of wine, two waters and a coke, our total bill for the evening came out to $460 for the both of us. I obviously spent more than I expected but that would have been ok had the food been outstanding. But unfortunately I found it very mediocre.Despite rave reviews for the angel hair pasta with caviar, I found it just 'ok'. The only standouts were the apple tart and cheese plate. My main of cocotte chicken was moist and tender, but reminded me of the steamed chicken rice I had for lunch that day. That was how boring it was.It will be awhile before I splurge on fine-dining in Singapore. Compared to many other cities in the world, I find Singapore fine-dining to be completely overpriced

Next to Garibaldi on Purvis St, Gunther's offers a very good value set menu. Warm bread with butter is a great start to a good meal. Must try the cold angel hair pasta with truffle oil and caviar!This place uses high quality silverware and glassware. Very comfortable setting. Excellent service
5
The services provided by this well appointed restaurant is superb, the chef/owner's culinary skill is to be applauded. Its fresh produce and fine selection of French cuisine was extensive. We were that impressed with their services, even though I thought the bill didnt add up properly by $20 SGD, I said nothing and gave an extra $30 tip. A thoroughly enjoyable evening. Strongly recommended!

I've noticed in recent years that restaurants in Singapore tend to inflate their prices without a matching increase in the quality of their food. So you can imagine what a nice surprise it is to walk into Gunther's hungry and walk out without feeling robbed.I was there with two girlfriends. We opted for the $128 Menu Dégustation with adjustments to some of the courses for a little bit more money. Not every dish was a hit, but there were no misses. Gunther's is famous for its Cold angel hair pasta with Oscietra caviar. And I'm happy to report it lives up to the legend. The saltiness of the caviar and the aroma of truffle oil are reigned in by the cold pasta – great flavours that complement and don't overwhelm – so that every bite was a delight. We had it as an appetiser and couldn't get enough of it. No wonder people would pay $60 for it as a main.My other big favourite was the Milk-fed veal, selected from the seasonal menu to replace my meat course at $30 extra. It's perhaps the best extra $30 I've spent. The meat was so tender and juicy. And it was dripping with the sweetness of marrow. Since my visit, I've held Gunther's as the benchmark for quality and value. And so far, no restaurant that has charged me for more than what I paid at Gunther's, has given me the same kind of quality cuisine. Not by a huge margin

My family was visiting Singapore for my father's 80th birthday and we wanted to go somewhere really good as he is a big foodie and a regular Singapore visitor. We could not have been more happy with our choice. The food was superb - we were still talking about it days later and the staff brilliant. It is an attractive small restaurant and although completely fully booked the night we were there we had attentive personal service. There were ten of us so we able to try a wide variety of dishes and every dish was perfect. The staff also made a discrete fuss over my Dad which made him feel special. It is not inexpensive but I think is value for money. Am determined to go back there every time I am in Singapore and I have been recommending it to everyone

I have returned to Gunther's repeatedly since its opening & have never been disappointed. So much so that it has become my favourite restaurant in Singapore. Admittedly it is not cheap but then the good things in life are expected to cost more. They have responded to the call from more reasonably priced menus & the prix fixe menus offer the Gunther's experience at an affordable price & good value. The service is professional & attentive; I've always been warmly greeted there & everyone from Chef Gunther onwards has been exceedingly kind to me. My favourites? The cold pasta with osetra caviar; Chef Gunther's cappelini pasta with kombu, the roast lobster served with pilaf rice, the suckling pig....the list goes on but without doubt the must order dish for dessert is the apple tart with run raisin ice cream which is anything but mundane. Thin pastry reminiscent of Moroccan bistiya coated with crushed almond dragees with a thin filling of apples. Cooled down with a quenelle of the most luscious ice cream you have ever tasted. Gunther's is a treat you can afford to treat yourself to

It's difficult to eat badly in Singapore, but this is the best. Good service, great food and ambiance. Highly recommended.

We really enjoyed the food at Gunther's. Genuine modern french cuisine, very tasty without being too experimental (which is good for a change). The atmosphere is good (nothing exciting though) and the service very attentive.We ordered for starters the chicken broth (with a great egg yolk inside), the wagyu beef with potato crust and the grilled girolle mushrooms with Iberico Ham (which was one of the specials of the day and it was actually fantastic). Easily the best plate from the 3 starters. I loved the fact that it was so simple as a dish yet so delicious and gourmet.For main course we had the rack of black pig with mushrooms and the special of the day which was lamp . The black pig was really an amazing rich dish full of flavours. The lamp was very good as well (although I have to say that the Chef used exactly the same -delicious it has to be said- sauce he used in the black pig dish).For desert we had the Valrhona chocolate fondant (loved it). They were very kind and they also offered us a second desert (a chocolate souffle) on the house.All in all it was a very good dining experience bar one thing: the unmentioned cost of the specials of the day. When the maitre came and listed us all the specials of the day he didnt mentioned their prices (which is actually very impropriate for such a good restaurant). We guessed that their prices would be equivalent to the prices of the menu. Unfortunately we were wrong. The price range of the main courses in the a la carte menu ranged from 45$ (singapore dollars) to 90$ (the most expensive one which was beef chateaubriand). However when the bill came we were suprised to see that the lamp (which was special of the day together with many other dishes) was priced for 120$!!! First of all I find it quite unreasonable such a big price difference with the rest of the main courses and secondly when the prices of the specials of the day are so high they must at least mention them. For that reason I rate my dining experience with 4 stars instead of 5. Still a very good French gourmet restaurant

Gunthers is a superb restaurant, absolutely no question with excellent, polite and highly knowledgable staff. The food is as good as we've had at many 'michelin star' restaurants and the specials are often superb.The problem with Gunthers however is it really is pricing itself on the absolute limit of decency. As much as we love the place we don't go regularly because of that reason no matter the quality. A great great restaurant but guys please..... tone down the prices a bit.........

I have dined here twice. Both occassions were dissapointing. The first was with my wife who is a vegetarian. They didnt specifically have many vegetarian choices on the menu so the waiter informed us that we shaould leave the choice to the chef. We therefore left it in their 'capable' hands. That decision came with a price! Over the 3 courses they gave her very soup with truffles, salad starter with truffles and pasta with truffles for the main course. The cost of all 3 courses was just under $200. I detest a fine dining restaurrant that sets out to empty your pockets. I have dined in so many fine dining restaurants and dont mind paying good money for good food but this treatment was underhand. A few weeks later I returned on a work dinner, of which i was not paying. There were 12 of us and a fair bit of money was spent. What they failed to tell us was that the drinks and in particular the liquors given were the most expensive they had. They didnt bother to explain the price even when asked. The result was a $8,000 bil for 12 people. Just be warned in this place and make sure you know what you are eating / drinking as they often try not to tell you the prices
5
The standard fare on the menu is very good, and of course the angel hair pasta with caviar and truffle oil is rightly famous, but if you're tired of fine dining where you are just there to have the chef parade a series of arty dishes in front of you, Gunther's is a great antidote.The service is friendly and manages to give the feeling that they are there to help arrange things so that you get what you want, not what the kitchen demands you must have. The famous angel hair pasta for example, $60 is quite a large serve so we asked if we could split one. Of course, no problem at all, and it duly arrived on two different plates.But the real fun is seeing the daily specials platter and discussion with the staff what you might want and how you might want it done. Don't be shy about asking for prices of things on the board, they don't go into that initially, probably just to save time, but it is well worth giving things on the board a go.On our board there was a selection of fish, a lobster, scallop, an absolutely massive oyster, crab, and other things including a large onion. We asked about the onion, it was $15 done a gratin, and you could add shaved truffle for $6 per gram. We went with that with 5g of truffle. Now I didn't have any weigh scales, but it could well have been more than 5g of truffle on there, certainly I wasn't demanding a recount, and there was plenty for the size of dish. And it was superb. We also got a whole blue brittany lobster split between us, absolutely delicious and for $120 between the two of us, pretty good buying. We filled out our order with a couple of other things from the normal menu and the total bill for two people excluding drinks was around $250 for a meal with dishes including truffles, lobster, fois gras, wagyu and caviar.On another trip the platter had a tomato on it, which I ordered and came simply served with a vanilla vinagrette - absolutely superb.A final example of the staff "looking after you": We wanted a bit of cheese, so they brought over the platter, discussed the cheeses and pointed to a few we'd like to try, but explained we only wanted a smallish serve. Whist the guy is carving up the cheese we're having a nice chat to him and we notice the piles of cheese he is cutting are fairly hefty, he tells us not to worry he has plenty of the stuff. So lots of cheese with two plates of accompianments cost $15. At another top singaporean restaurant (Les Amis) we had a similar scenario. We said we'd like a very small serving of cheese, and the waiter said leave it to him. Later in the meal a very small serving did arrive, we got no choice in the matter and they weren't to out tastes particularly and then the bill at the end had us down for 2 serves and $40 of cheese.I think this emphasises the difference between Gunther's and many other fine diners. Here the staff are down to earth and not aloof, and the chef and owner comes out to check on how your meal is progressing. The staff are not there to make things difficult and when they say "leave it to me" I would do so with confidence.Top marks Gunther's! If you want great fresh food, cooked simply but well and a down to earth service with a fine dining feel, this is for you. It's not super cheap, but it's less than half the price of dinner at Restaurant Andre or Iggy's or Les Amis, and it's a place you might feel at home, rather than a visitor

Smiles at the door augured a great evening.We were each served a dab of deftly-fried shrimp tempura as amuse-bouche. My Japanese buddy approved. A weekday night meant we couldn't really go overboard with wine, so we picked two whites from the by-the-glass, though the prices of the full bottles were enough to subdue any foolhardy over-enthusiasm for plonk (not that Gunther's is the sole offender, other high-end-y restaurants here are equally mind-blowing in their barefaced charging - yes, old, old complaint but still a valid one).At Gunther's, of course, how could I help but give myself over to the angel hair pasta drenched in luscious oscietra caviar. My friend's generous films of Scottish salmon elicited noises of approval as well.We each then enjoyed a serving of the immensely aromatic but startlingly delicate chicken consomme, over which hovered a near-translucent bloom of champignons de Paris (Portobello, for the Anglophones amongst us) hiding a centre of yolk that broke and created a mini-sensation of taste.My main was lobster thermidor - I was offered a choice of blue or Maine, but not being one of the island's true-blue millionaires I stuck with the plebeian option (I might have chosen crab as well - which looked temptingly plump upon the cart the maitre d' rolled by at the start, but it cost a LOT more). The plate was a devilish temperature first served (almost burnt myself) - I could detect the mustard, egg and alcohol in the very competent sauce, while the tricky crustacean meat was cradled in the confident crux between firm and soft (though the local chilli crab specialists have this down pat, so it's just part of the deal at any place worth its salt). In short, a complex dish, easily stodgy but achieving a balanced note tonight, which I could not fault at all.My friend faced the Angel-hair pasta with Monte Poro, dried prawns, kombu and chives (to give the dish its due) - it is one of Gunther's trusty staples - he declared it excellent.Throughout this we were served warm bread with an extremely buttery butter, frankly sinful and very good indeed.Never too full for gluttony, I got myself the souffle (Grand Marnier) and my friend the Valrhona chocolate fondant. Maybe the lobster was too rich a precedent, but I just could not finish the souffle.Aside: A girl at the next table was served Grand Marnier instead of the vanilla she ordered - the manager noted the error and she was swiftly given a replacement, though she had already tucked into her existing souffle (another reason why Gunther's is still around while other more flashy places have sputtered).Petits fours were a nice touch, but by this time my body was going into gym-alert mode.Gunther's - a sensation (of sorts), it seemed, really a lifetime ago - when did it become such a comfy snuggy, "my local" kind of place? The relatively non-angina-inducing bill probably has quite a bit to do with it (that being said, just a cautionary note to impecunious undergrads - unless daddy pays, it might not be the brightest idea to take your girl to ol' Gunt's for a night out - stick to what your pocket can reasonably handle for now).If you're in the area, and sick at heart of paying a pound of flesh for a Michelin-name-tagged meal in this city, remember Gunther's as a decent, quietly classy choice

Had dinner there with two business colleagues. The restaurant has a small menu and several specials. The specials are explained using a display of the fresh base ingredients off a trolley.The caveat here is that the specials work off an unpublished price list. To giev an example i had planned to share a menue item of salted baked sea bass listed as SGD$45 pp, however this was not available. So the maitre d suggested the bream instead. I assumed that this would be within a similar price range but was taken aback when seeing it priced on the bill as SGD$90.That said, the meal was delicious. The bread sticks served were wonderfully warm and the chef supplied a tempura prawn as a taster. The wine list is pretty good but like most places in Singapore very expensive.Desserts were divine( apple tart, grand marnier souffle) as were the complimentary petit fours

With all the new restaurants popping up in sg its hard to remember where the basic good old food are. We went back to gunther all 7 of us recently and had a special menu crafted to our budget. All i can is that it was sublime and very enjoyable. The new places are all over priced and sometimes overhyped that gunther now looks reasonable. Its a great modern french restaurant that doesnt dosappoint us. Luv it

We went here with a couple of friends, upon recommendation of colleagues. Very classy place located off the beaten track. The setting and atmosphere is very nice and you feel really catered for.I went with beef, as so often before. They show you the fantastic choice of raw meats, so you can select exactly what you desire. The wine list is long - but it is hard to find wines in a price range you wish for a normal wednesday night. The food was very nice across the board, the ladies chose fish, which looked so delicious, that I even had to try it. Well worth it.The deserts are out of this world and I had to try several.Gunthers offers a nice setting and very nice food - it is on the very high side though and we paid something like USD 1500 for 4 people. The value for money is a bit off, which is what takes this down to 4 stars
5
Having read previous reviews - mostly good, but also some choice words about prices and service - I was a little anxious about choosing the restaurant for our wedding anniversary. I shouldn't have - the evening was quite pleasant and we left the restaurant impressed.The wife chose the degustation menu which she enjoyed tremendously and, at SGD128++, is arguably good value in Singapore these days. I ordered ala carte and had an appetiser, an entree and a dessert for about the same price, all of which was very good. The wine list had decent choices by the glass, which I appreciated, and had a few. Service was friendly and professional

GGs refer to Galibaidi & Gunthers which are among the best of best italian food.

The Lobster Carpaccio and Angel Hair pasta with Caviar are divine!

The best angel hair pasta I ever tasted. Go for the appetiser size in order to leave room for other dishes.
Try the suckling pig as well. That is also very delicious.

In the small street of Purvis, very close to Raffles Hotel and Carlton Hotel is this gem of a restaurant called Gunther's. While it has its share of critics, the evening we had dinner there the service and the food was flawless. We had the angel hair pasta with caviar and the carpaccio of Wagyu beef for starters. Both were really excellent - the pasta we found out later is the restaurant's signature dish. That evening they also had fresh seafood from Euope and Japan, with white asparagus flown in from France. I had the prawns grilled with black pasta on the side while my wife had the asparagus with gratinated cheese and mushrooms. Restaurants with good food are sometimes brought down by haughty and impolite staff. Not that night in Gunther's. Alex the maitre d' was the perfect host and the waiters were there to serve and not to be obtrusive. This was a night to splurge. So we did. We ended the evening with apple tart for dessert and came out poorer but happier If you have that need and ability to spurge, Gunther's a great, nay, an excellent place to go
5
Been there several times for the set-lunch menu and can only recommend it. It offers the best of Gunther's talents at a very moderate price (35 SGD ++). I love the quiet atmosphere, the delicate service and the good wines available by the glass.However, I must admit that I have heard some disappointments from people dining "a la carte" (it is true that both wine prices and food prices "a la carte" seem quite high... hence the set lunch as a great opportunity!)Furthermore, it is quite nice to enjoy refined gastronomy in Singapore in a real street, in a real house (i.e. not in a mall

Together with two Asian friends we had dinner at Gunther’s on Friday 16. March 2012. That evening we experienced a „French Cuisine Experience“ that does not lived up to our expectations. After a nice presentation of fresh food I discussed with the waiter the order of a “Chateaubriand” and with that what a “Chateaubriand” by definition shall be. We agreed that this is the center cut of a filet mignon cooked in one big piece. So I ordered that “Chateaubriand” with pepper corn sauce. When the “Chateaubriand” was presented I immediately realized that the piece of meet was not a center cut piece, it was a filet of two pieces attached together, normally the head from the filet. So I asked the servant, the one before agreeing to definition above, why he is not serving the center cut. As he was unsure what to say in this delicate situation he went back to see his chef and owner Gunther. He came back and told us that this is by definition now a “Chateaubriand” even after saying differently before. I was surprised about this behavior and expected an explanation, which never came, and I must say I felt quite stupid! Anyhow, I could not leave it like that and after the dinner I took up the subject once again. So I asked the servant whether it is not normal that the Chef would come to the table to discuss the client’s eating experience. The answer was “yes” but my friend who visited that place several times told me that Gunther never came to the tables and so it was that evening. So it seems that “great” Gunther cannot take the heat and leaves the problems to his staff. A poor altitude for such a “great” Chef! What leads me finally to the food, which in my opinion was just average and nothing special! The peppercorn sauce was more of a cream sauce with a few peppercorns, not very tasty and definitely not what one would expect in France as a peppercorn sauce! Of course Gunther’s food experience maybe attracts Asian people who have not much clue of real good French food, so this explains his “success”. And by the way the price for what you get is outrages, so e.g. we paid for 100g of Spanish dry ham $160 and for my “Chateaubriand” $180 of course plus tax and service. So if you know what to expect from good French Cuisine, think twice before you visit that place

There is no question that the quality of food and prep is very high. Creative with out over doing it. Everything properly seasoned., etc. Only complaint was the timing between the dishes of our eight course meal (as much as 20 minutes). However, while I am the last person complain about the cost of a restaurant, I do get very upset when they "try to pull a fast one". Our set course was $298. No problem. On arrival, glass of bubbly (Bill Sal Rose) of course (turns out to be $45 a glass, for a bottle that costs $70-80) and then of course the special "French" (not Iranian or Russian) caviar course. They don't tell you how much (for the very small tin) but then you get the bill at its $200. It didn't taste like "real" caviar. Shame because its a excellent spot with a talented chef. Most restaurants (although there are great ones in France and Japan who are exception) are open to make money, but the they should never let you feel it....they should create a world in which they are there for the customer's pleasure, especially when you are paying over $1000 for 2

My wife and I decided to visit this resturant last night to finish off our week long stay in Singapore. We thought that a fine dinning experience would be a good way to round off our trip and we had a recommendation from a work colleague to check this place out. Ok enough background story here's what you need to know. If you decide to eat here, be very, very careful. The whole place seems designed to fleece you blind (meaning it's incredibly expensive and there are so many hidden extras that will quickly inflate your final bill.We were first asked if we would like to start our meal with a glass of Rose, and we thought why not, sounds like a pleasant way to start. Then we were presented the 'special' plate of raw ingredients, fish and meat. It all looked good but what was special about this plate was that none of the prices were on the menu, when we asked, it turned out that the steak was over $190 (compared to $75 option on the menu) the Alaskian King Crab legs were priced over $140. Granted the beef was wagu but still. The food itself is actually pretty good. The angel hair pasta starter was delicious (my order). The sea urchin ( my wife's order) was, well just a raw sea urchin, nothing very fine dining about it, just a cut in the top and a spoon to eat it with! Our main course dishes were again very good. I ordered the Rack of Black Pig ($65) and my wife the tenderlion ($75), afterwhich we were quite full. So after being asked several times if we wanted to dessert we decided to share a choclate fondant ( warm centered chocolate cake).This is the kicker for me though. Halfway through dessert a member of staff ( perhaps manager?) came over and asked why we did not choose a desert each? Was it because we ate too much bread? Which we thought was a bit strange, it felt like we were being hasseled to buy more. Later, it was time to pay the bill, this was the fun part. This is when we found that we had been charged twice for our starters and twice the number of bottles of water we had drunk. Which we managed to get removed from the bill only after checking. Oh yes, and that refreshing glass of Rose that was suggested to us at the very start of the night? Turned out to cost $90 (2 glasses at $45 each!)Overall, this is probably the most expensive place we have ever eaten at, even without ordering any bottles of wine etc, and we are not unfamiliar with visiting 'fine dining' resturants in our home city of Hong Kong. So my advice to anyone thinking of going here is, be very,very careful, unless your on a company expense account or struck it lucky in the casino! When doing the math this place is simply not worth it

And so to a special night as it was an evening planned well beforehand and with expectation, having had some weeks of anticipation as it were.Situated in its own traditional "shop house" on the picturesque Purvis Street in town, Gunthers is subtle from the start and as one is settled into your seat at one of the well spaced tables, you realise that much care has been put into making this a destination haute cuisine venue. This applies to the service as well as all aspects of the lighting, ambience and manner of the waiting staff.The degustation menu is actually a good value proposition rather than an extravagant choice as can be in other restaurants, and though portions are small it is more than enough as there are quite a few courses in succession as well as the various amuses bouches. Gunthers signature angel hair pasta is good but was not as mind blowing as I had anticipated, possibly because I had read too much or too many times about it. All other courses were similarly well conceived but again at times very good rather than extraordinary, though all in all it made for a great evening.From beginning to end the delivery is well executed and though it may not have hit every single spot, it is at the top range in most areas. A great and established venue in the ever expanding Singaporean scene

With friends we like to visit Singapore's top restaurants. Gunther's was highly recommended by some guides, but unfortunately we have to rate it below the "top", even though the food was good. Perhaps our expectations were too high, or perhaps Gunthers is not consistent enough and we were there on a "bad" evening.We had the menu degustation, since this should represent the chef's style and skills well. The angel hair pasta, the poached egg and the gamba's were all lovely, though not exquisite, as we had expected. The chicken was ok, although the choice for chicken in a restaurant with such ambition surprises me. Portions were tiny, we shared probably half a chicken with the 4 of us. Desert (apple tart) was very good, though small.The staff did not have their best night. The host did advise a great wine, but competely lost interest in us when we ordered the menu degustation (instead of the more expensive dishes or non-menu items?). Staff forgot our friends a couple of time when serving bread, and finally we were never asked what desert we wanted (the menu offers cheese and appeltart), we were simply given the appletart.All in all, we had a nice meal and a great evening, but below expectation for a restaurant which positions itself (and is recommended by guides) as "top"

Excellent food. Comparable or better than other celebrity chef restaurants

we love the honest use of good ingredients but was overdosed with truffles!

Very nice and not that expensive for this type of restaurant.
Tasting menu for SG $128 ++.. Great wine list. I usually don't like the apple
tart, but this one was fantastic. The appetizer pasta with caviar and truffles
tastes incredibly good..

2 mediocre meals so far and 1 tremendous experience. Last visit involved 'no cheese available' which is absurd for a restaurant of this price and supposed class.

I cannot think of single complaint about this restaurant. Wr have eaten here a number of time and without fail, our meals have been perfect.The welcome and ongoing service are warn and relaxed. Many of the ingredients are freshly flown in on a daily basis making for superb cuisine. Nothing is over-engineered, just clearly prepared by people who are passionate about food. The wine list is fabulous and the sommelier is extraordinarily helpful. I have always found it impossible to resist the cheese tray. I guess that if you were to complain about anything, it would be the price, but ingredients like Alaskan King Crab, fresh off the airplane do not come cheap anywhere. If price is an issue, the set lunch menu is one of the best bargains in town

We reserved a table for lunch and it was not full when we arrived.Very small restaurant with tables close to each other we were forced to hear conversations of other diners. Was given the menu and immediately asked if we needed table water. That was fine but no explanation of the food menu until 20 minutes later when a senior slouching waiter (he was wearing a coat) came with a trolley full of the 'specials' that came with absurd prices that even he seemed unsure of,and when asked simple questions about those specials and the main menu he switched topic as he couldn't answer them.Naturally we went for the menu. Only the wagyu beef tartare was memorable. My codfish was so oily that 5 bites was all it took for me to get sick of it. My partner ordered desserts for sharing,but it was nothing memorable that I could only recall that I ended my lunch with coffee. Pressed for time,I gave my credit card to another waiter for him to settle the bill. I realised upon signing it that they charged us an additional dish of foie gras that we didn't even ordered ! It took another 10 minutes for them to void the transaction and present the correct bill to me. Not recommended even if all the good ones are full

Service was excellent from the moment we arrived to the moment we departed. For my appertiser I chose 2 Norwegian scallops - OK but not great. My wife didn't want an appertiser, but the salad sent out a complimentary salad for her so she wouldn't feel left out. Very nice touch. For my main I chose rom the selection of non-menu items that were offerered and got badly 'slugged'. I should have asked the price for the fish...but still it was cooked to perfection and I loved it. My wife chose the duck breast and found it also very good. The cheese platter was an amazing and very high quality selection, but again I should have asked the price! The sweet red wine recommended to go with the platter was an excellent choice and complimented the cheese perfectly.Overall though the service, ambience, and food made this a 5 star dining experience, despite the shock when I got the bill! I would certainly return next time I am in Singapore

The set lunch is $38. I asked to swap out the main for Alaskan king crab w pasta, they brought half a leg w a modest amount of pasta, and they charged me $158 for the set. Delicious, but seriously?! I appreciated the obliging service, but would have appreciated much more a heads up on the $120 mark-up

We are fond of good restaurants and make it a point to try at least one each time we travel. A quick search on the Net brought us to Gunther's when we were in Singapore and though compared to local offerings the price was steep, we decided to go ahead with our reservation.The restaurant is near Raffles Hotel and is housed in a row of shophouses. We were served by a French-speaking male which suited us well as he would be better able to answer our questions about the ingredients. We were shown a trolley filled with wagyu beef, king crab etc - all very expensive imported ingredients especially in Singapore.We politely declined it and ordered from the menu instead, in fact we took the $128++ tasting dinner menu which turned out to be an excellent choice. Asked just for the egg/Spanish ham to be substituted with foie gras which they kindly obliged. Had a few glasses of red French wines to go with the meal and they were generous glasses.The cold angel hair pasta with caviar was amazing, such a burst of different tastes and textures. Never expected it to be so good. There was kombu in it, a fusion dish.The foie gras was a little nerveux but nicely cooked, crusted with candied nuts. The lamb was rosé, tender, juicy. The bamboo clam with tomatoes was interesting - my first.There was dessert or cheese (a good choice) to go with it and service was at times hesitant (he was new) but generally attentive and good. I would recommend

It had been years ago since I ate at Gunther's. No specific reason as we had a most enjoyable dinner last time. To many new places to try, I guess.However with a colleague I decided to go for lunch @ Gunther's since they are close to our office. And again I had a most enjoyable experience.They offer a la carte and set lunches. The set lunch has a choice for starter and main based on fish/meat or veg. Followed by dessert of the day.I had the consommé with foie gras to start with and the consommé really complemented the foie gras. Without the foie gras it did not have a lot of taste but with it it was really good.Then followed by the tagliatelle Provencal - pasta with different veggies. Veggies were nice and crisp and the sauce was mainly some herbs and oil. All based on the natural taste of the food.Dessert of the day was a panna cotta with a caramel hint, served in magnificent silverware.And together with coffee we receive a plate of little bites: caneles, chocolat etc.The lunch really filled us up but was definitely worth doing again. And let's not forget the friendly and attentive staf

gunther is one of my fav fine dining restaurant in singapore! those food are amazing and delicious. i really love the cold caviar in there.well in terms of menu very classique and presentation is average but it taste simply perfect!it's quuite expensive actually. i suggest u dont take the surprise menu if u dont want to spend a lot money in ghunter

A friend and I recently tried their Chef's selection degustation. The menu was a bit of a surprise, since we didn't know this was available. Our maitre d' asked us our budget range and off we went. We had matching French wines, some of these brought out the best in the dishes and there was just one which didn't really match. But that's a matter of personal taste as the wines all leaned towards white varietals as we had mostly a selection of seafoods. Dishes ranged from angel hair and caviar which is signature dish, wagyu carpaccio so delicate - I almost thought it was a fish carpaccio. There was Normandy oyster, and the main was a lamb dish with exquisite sauce. I am a big fan of the degustation menus as a way of tasting the finest dishes of any chef's repetoire. These dishes were all well done and delicious. I was somewhat missing the WOW factor I was looking for when we first decided out of all the fine dining restaurants in Singapore to try on this trip. Ambiance is great in the smaller rooms on the side but the main room was a bit noisy. The bigger tables are there. Value for money is not as great as I thought. But I definitely recommend trying the general dego or at least the angel hair pasta! It's this unique taste with bursts of flavour

Gunther's probably is one of the best restaurants in Singapore. Very consistent quality and presentation. The cold angel hair pasta with truffle oil and caviar is one of the best things ever!!!. However, when we comes to the wine I think they could make it better. While the wine list is excellent and vast, prices are beyond ridiculous. The worse is the wine by glass were there are only 3 options of red and 3 options of white (one Montrached at $39 a $?#@, one riesling ??? and one Sancerre?????). Similar for reds. It disappoints given everything else so great they have to offer

After having Gunther's on my "must do" list for a number of years now, I recently finally got around to visiting the esteemed establishment. Whereas I have always had a sublime experience at Gunther's peers such as Il Lido & Forlino I was left rather flat after my offering. An OK starter was just OK but it was "Gunther's Creation" that left me totally flat. A thin strip of steak. Is that really the extent of the Master Chefs creative brilliance or did he just have lots of steak left in the freezer ?!?! It looks like more trips to Il Lido and Forlinos for me...

Having heard and read a great deal about this restaurant, we were a little disappointed with our overall experience.The smaller dining room we were in was gloomy and lacked the buzz of the main room. The food was OK but nothing like as fine as we had imagined.The cold caviar pasta ‘signature dish’ was not pleasant tasting and the remaining courses of the tasting menu were nice enough but fell far short of our expectations.Service was good enough but not outstanding as you would expect, and no where near as good as garibaldi, the sister restaurant next door. We were forgotten on a number of occasions which meant we fell behind with our wine pairings. Not idealOverall, disappointingly average which was not reflected in the price

It was a memorable dinner at Gunther Restaurant. Wise people always says Nothing Is Perfect in this World. But in Gunther's Restaurant dining is real perfect for me. Been there many times and have Gunther's Surprise Menu and it never dissapoint me of any of the courses. Good Food, Very good service and it sums up to total satisfaction, We have no budget as we like to keep our budget open as we want to taste the best food. Only eat here when you appreciate food and understand it. That is a good diner. I always believe this because that is the way to understand the Chef cooking. If its good means its good and why does one have to compare other restaurants as each individuals to each skills. In Gunther's no doubt he is the best Chef in Singapore. And in Gunther Restaurant where you can find best service. And the wine list is big and many good wines. I love this restaurant and most of my friens love and rate this restaurant the best in Singapore. Trust me if the food is good money is not an issues! Good food, good wine and good service. Way to go! Michelin should give them the stars

AMBIANCE & SERVICEThe ambiance is nice as it should be in a smart casual restaurant. The walls are dark and the lighting is dimmed, it’s a very romantic setting. The tables are quite close though, so you can’t have any really private discussions as the neighbour will hear all you are saying. They have smaller rooms so I guess you can book for a private dining room also. The service is really good. The waiters are attentive and bring bread and water without you having to ask for it. Their knowledge of the food and wine is good, no complaints there.FOOD & PRICE LEVELThe food is really overrated and overpriced! We maybe just had a bad experience but we will never ever go back and the reason is the food and the price level! We are happy to pay a high price for excellent food (like in Raffles Grill or Le Saint Julien for example), and in Singapore most 4-5 star restaurants are expensive, but this restaurant is so much overpriced considering the level of food they serve. It is not up to the standards of a 5 star restaurant. They claim to be a modern French restaurant and yes there are French dishes on the menu, but in my opinion this is more of a modern European restaurant. It is not distinguishably French (except for the wine list maybe). The food and wines are very expensive. Expect to spend at least SGD400 - SGD500 for dinner for two persons including one bottle of wine. That is ok in Singapore if the food and service are impeccable, but this was not the case here. We had the daily special starter, which was a slice of Japanese melon, Spanish ham, tomatoes and mozzarella cheese. What’s French about that? The dish was not in balance and the different flavours did not melt into each other, they were just kind of dancing around in your mouth. Not a successful combination in my opinion. We also had the traditional French pan fried foie gras with sweet dates, which was fine but a bit booring and traditional. If you are “modern French” one would expect you do something more modern with one of the most traditional French fine dining ingredients. As mains we had the daily special, which was one Alaskan king crab leg (huge) served with pasta on the side. The crab and pasta was fine, but the cheese that covered the crab leg was a bit overwhelming. When you pay over SGD110 for a crab leg you want to taste the crab, not Emmenthal cheese! The pasta was good, cooked al dente and mixed with oil and red chilli. We also had another main course of the specials list; steak of waguye beef. That was a big disappointment. Maybe the meet supplier had made a mistake or the meet was cut wrongly but the steak was so chewy and tough that you could not cut it with a knife or chew it in your mouth. The waiter offered to change the steak to a new one and then brought the greasiest small pieces of meat we had seen in a while. It was like they had cut some left over part of a bigger piece of meat in to small stripes and fried them on the pad. The meat was dripping of butter and half of the pieces were just white fat. Horrible! Needless to say also that dish was left uneaten. They only charged half of the waguye beef’s price but it was still close to SGD100. Crazy! The meat dishes came with corn and veggies, which were fine. The corn was cut in half and the centre removed so that it was easy to eat. Smart! We were so disappointed with the food we didn’t have any desert. Our wine was one of the house wines and it was ok and priced at mid range. Nothing outstanding and memorable though.TEN POINTS FOR THE BREADThe thing we are going to remember this restaurant by for a long time forward is not the disappointing and expensive food, but the excellent bread! They make their own small baguettes and they are so good! And they serve the bread with decent, salted butter. We give them 10 points for the great French bread and salted butter

Although I'm not the one judging whether an etablissement gets a Michelin star or not, this evening they had deserved 2**! We (a couple) went with the idea to pick something from their normal offerings but the presentation of the specialities at the table where so attractive that we both went with some of the recommendations. Well done as the presented food was super / real top of the bill! The best food I had for a while and I dine once or twice a week and regularly in a good restaurant in various cities of this planet. By the way, the service was good too! It also was nice to have had a chat with the cook and te manager but that maybe was because we were coming from Europe.When, then I only can come up with one remark and that is that, when one picks something from the specialities platter, one does not know what the cost is going to be. At the end the surprise then obviously was that dinner was way over what we had in mind but seen the nice experience, we have not complained

We are great fans of Gunther's restaurant and would go as far as to say it is probably the best restaurant in Singapore and certainly as good if not better than any 3 star Michelin restaurant in which we have dined around the world. The food is always a perfect marriage of flavour, texture, fragrance and presentation. We have never been disappointed. We don't bother with the menu, we just let the chef cook for us however many courses we instruct him to do. Each course is such a surprise.The decor is elegant art deco. The service is impeccable. It is not a cheap night out but the quality of the food and service do exceed expectations. We have dined in many restaurants where the price is similar but the quality is astoundingly poor.Our only negative comment would be is that the mark-up on wine prices is nothing short of extortionate. Doesn't stop us going though and we always have a magical experience

i ordered the floating island of champignon de paris on consommé of poultry and cold angel hair pasta. i can't really rave about them but they did taste good. maybe it's the though of eating food with very fine ingredients that makes people going to gunther's. but to be honest, the taste of the food can be rivaled by casual dining restaurants like marmalade.but the service is excellent! cannot fault them on that

Gunthers never fails to deliver. Excellent food. Suckling pig is best....same dish at Iggy's 5x worse....

Ranked by Miele Guide as the 4th best restaurant in Asia. Very nice fares. Try the excellent cold pasta with truffles.

I ate at Gunther’s on a Thursday at the end of my visit in Singapore. For those fans of French cuisine it is definitely worth the trip if you are in the mood for excellent food in elegant surroundings.Setting: Located on Purvis Street, just around the corner from Raffles. Elegantly appointed dining room with nice spacing between tables. Understatement is the word here, as the focus is on the food. The dining room I was in had seven tables which allowed privacy, intimacy, and warmth at the same time. Gunther's has managed to aquire in his restaurant that most elusive of traits: "atmosphere."  Food: There are no disappointments. As I have said in previous reviews, I think you are doing yourself a disservice by dining “American style” (i.e. appetizer, main course, dessert) at a restaurant like this. I had the Chef’s Tasting menu (8 courses with paired wines) which can be tailored to your liking. The simple dish of angel hair pasta with Oscietre caviar was one of the best courses I have eaten, as of this writing only rivaled by the “asparagus wrapped in salmon with a caviar blini” at Le Meurice in Paris. The Wagyu beef was very memorable. I admittedly do not have a sophisticated palate, but there was not a single dish I didn’t enjoy. The wine pairings were quite thoughtful.Service: Very attentive and knowledgeable waiters. Some minor topping-off problems with the bread especially but overall quite good. Not quite the opera that you’ll get at the very top notch places, but I would imagine that will come with time.Summary: I did not eat at Iggy’s or Les Amis, but I would be surprised if they could match the combination of food, service, and atmosphere. Gunther was gracious enough to have dessert with me at the end of the meal and it was evident that he is running this restaurant for the love of it, pure and simple. I can also guarantee that this restaurant will only get better in years to come after hearing about the effort and time he is putting into it. Very highly recommended

Good food yet affordable. Wine also affordable at the price of $90's. Cant complain cause its a good wine rather than eating in casual dining restaurant and having a nonsense wine. Here in Gunther's you find yourself enjoying the excellent SERVICE and Gunther's Excellent Food. Handsome looking Waiters. Maybe one day i wanna ask one of them out for a date. That would be beautiful. I love the guys there. Good SERVICE, Good Food & Good looking Waiters!!! Sincere Waiter i call them

Together with my $150 lunch, we had a complimentary consomme broth, sea salt crusted fish and a 2nd dessert after his legendary applepie. Love Gunther's.

lousy degustation menu

I definitely would not mind going back to revenge on the rest of the menu. There is a section of specials that focused on black truffles, which I love.. and there is a more permanent section featuring caviar - but only oscetra.. The bill was quite phenomenal.. black truffles starter with scallops was SGD69 per pax.. It was more expensive than the rose champagne we had! The only thing missing is the aroma, that I expected it to be much stronger considering the generous shavings of fresh black truffles on the plate! If anything is lacking, it is the olfactory touch to the dishes.
