Super rude staff, specially the old guy at the counter. Poor quality of veggies! I will better get my Salad from other salad stops around Raffles. Will never visit this shop again!! Avoid!

This restaurant is located near to City hall mrt. Simple decoration, good atmosphere. Vegetables are fresh and Varieties of choices. Price is also reasonable. Worth a try. Check out the photos.

We ate here a few times, the wraps are freshly made and are the best we've ever had. One wrap, cut in two, is quite a meal. Try the tandoori chicken!

Ok basically I tried to order some salad here. Looking at the choices I couldn’t decide. So I went to take a photo using my phone to my friends, asking for recommendations. However an old service staff looked and stared angrily at me and yelled,” NO PHOTOS!” Well then if that was not bad enough she forced me out of the shop and started to threaten that if I continued to take photos then I will be reported to the authorities. Well what was that! Fancy that! On many other occasions at other shops(and by the way that was ION Orchard outlet) after that my salad size was ok, the salad filled to the brim of the bowl. But after that repeatedly my salad size shrunk!On my last visit to see if the shop changed, I went and wanted to buy a takeaway. You can get 7 items to put in your bowl excluding the lettuce. Upon putting in the first one, he already counted “4, oh sorry, 5 to go(when it’s actually 6)”. Can’t he even do some SIMPLE MATH? 7-1 is 6!! I asked to add one more ingredient to replace the one he skipped. However he didn’t notice it and gave me an EXTRA CHARGE. I GOT RIPPED OFF HERE, AND IM NEVER COMING BACK

I try to go daily for a healthy veggie wrap, which is a great lunch or dinner. You can build your own wrap or salad with a wide range of fresh healthy fruits and vegetables, which always taste delicious. They are quite busy so sometimes space or cleanliness isn't great, but all in all it's a favourite of mine :

We were looking for a place to have a refreshing salad for a change and by chance we found this beaut little place in a huge Food Hall. Massive amounts of salad with all sorts of different sauces, the serving is enough for 2 people. Freshly prepared in front of you by impeccably clean staff. My salmon wrap for 11.50 dollars was tasty and huge. Top place for a healthy snack

I was looking for a place to have salads and found Simply Wrapps at JEM (Jurong East) last weekend. Went for a wholesome Tower of Pisa wrap. The portion was huge (reminds me of the proper burritos from London's Benito's hat) and packed full of fresh vegetables. It would definitely fill you up. However, there was a tad too much sauce as I was fussing over a drenched, dripping wrap. I also downloaded their app to earn bonus points . You apparently can redeem $2 for a hot beverage of your choice (written in brochure), but the cashier said it was only for coffee and not tea. :(. Nonetheless, there are some great articles about healthy food in there. I enjoyed the food so much that I placed an online order for a make-your-own-wrap again today. This time the wrap was well made (not drenched in sauce). You can also choose to have the sauce on the side or none at all. Price is not cheap, but reasonable for the good portion

In my opinion, 1 wrap (consist of two halves) can be shared between 2 people! Very filling and yummy. Decently priced, it's like having a full 3 course meal in one serving. Healthy, yummy. Can opt for different sauce/dressing. I like mine with a bit of sweetness, to cut the freshness. Yummy, can never have enough, always coming back to try the different wraps ;)Good to share with family and friends, however the JEM outlet doesn't have baby chair

fulfilling my curiosity to eat this wraps after scrolling some sg based instagram accounts. they served halal, healthy, and not-so-pricey wraps. i decided to order their turkey wraps, and it was really good. light taste wraps with lots of vegetables in it. definitely will try their another wraps or fresh salad next tim

Great sizes for salads and lots of choices in a good location , delicious freshly squeeze juices, have it there or grab to go, fresh and healthy!

I ordered the wrap with falafel and couldn't find any in my wrap. Produce seemed old and wilted and everything was smothered in sauce to try and hide it. Skip this place.
4
I love their wide array of choices. Had a spinach wrap with "make your own salad" along with the creamy avocado dressing. Made me really full but not heavy. I feel like buying again!
3
I did not like the wrapps at all...neither were they mixed properly nor served peoperly and to add to it the tomatoes tasted like rotten ones!!
4
Make my own salad with Six sides with tropical mit sauce and add a soup of the day (brocolli)!! All for below twelvedolla!
5
This location has excellent staff who remember you and always offer a friendly welcome back or smile. I enjoy stopping in to get my dinner after work. Its a great location at Ion...when will they have their own Tripadvisor profile so I can give this location the recognition they deserve. It always puts a smile on my face knowing the staff will be consistent in their excellent service delivery.

For the most you are choosing between a salad dish or a wrap as the name says. They all look good when you see what others are ordering and our salad was very tasty. It's not cheap but reasonably priced. Worth a try if your in that food hall

I am staying at the Carlton Hotel in Singapore right next to Raffles Marketplace. On level one there are many great eateries and I discovered a real gem: Simply Wrapps!I ordered a custom wrap with all my favorite ingredients and each item was super fresh and savory. The salads are also made to order and looked amazing. My wrap was perfect and made for a very healthy lunch.Staff were very friendly and made great suggestions. I will be visiting Singapore frequently and this will be a regular stop for me
4
I used to have the salads but quickly found the wraps a lot more satisfying. The wraps keep you full for longer and are also a lot easier to eat if you're bringing them back to eat at your desk.A healthy and tasty quick lunch option whenever I can't decide what to eat

I love Simply Wrapps and eat there at least twice a week. The outlet nearest to my workplace is Ion Orchard. The staff are very friendly and do a good job.Because I love it so much I feel some constructive feedback is in order to improve the services and especially the consistency of how much of the black plastic bowl should be filled. Yesterday..the plastic bowl was filled to the brim and it really made me feel I got my $11 worth of each of the 2 salads that I always get. I always make my own salad so I know that I can add 6 different salad ingredients. Today the salad bowls were not filled to the top which made me a little sad...I would like consistency in making sure that for $11 each salad the bowl is filled...so even if with little more lettuce leaves...it will be great.Also the cashier did apologise so I don't hold it against her. But please ensure that if client ask for salad you are not charging for wraps...as in this case I questioned it as it was 0 .80 extra. But think if it was wraps I ordered and you charged me for salad instead ...it would mean revenue lost for yr shop. I would like to say the lady cashier immediately apologised and did return me 0.80 in cash so it was a mistake that was recovered very quickly.I only provide this feedback cause I love yr chain of shops and I visit any outlet as my first choice for healthy fresh salads and wraps with no guilt meals...I so wish you would open an oulet at the zoo. River safari and jurong bird park and night safari too.Thank you and see you soon.Nicol

Had the fresh tuna salad with edamame, corn and cherry tomatoes. Very nice but drenched in dressing and not a huge amount of tuna.
4
They serve wraps and salads, can't get any healthier. Servings are reasonable and food also quite tasty. It's also slightly cheaper than the competition. Service is typical counter/cafeteria-style, no more, no less. For a healthy meal, quite good value.
4
Choice of healthy n easy food, simply wrap is the best ! Consist of full vegetarian choice or seafood choice, selection of vege by ownself! Staffs are very friendly too and do be patient during peak hours around 7-9pm!
5
I had a bowl of salad while others had wraps. Fresh ingredients, lots of choices and good value. Subway's refined superior version according to me. And they sell fresh mixed juices too.
5
Fresh, generous servings, reasonably priced. For eaters with smaller appetite, get one wrap and share, their serving is that huge!Must try:- mango chicken! Average I spent:- around 11 bucks after I add on another ingredient. I always make my own salad or wraps
5
The line usually moves quick and you simply chose your wrap or salad type, what else you want to add on and they whip it up. There are a number of wrap choices and you can be creative if you don't like the options on the menu. They have chips and bottled drinks too. They also have a couple fresh squeezed drinks too, I recommend the daily dose and the Mexicans fiesta. Have it at least once per week. Seating can be limited at certain times

I would never write a review, if only after my remark to one of the stuff, she could shut up her mouth and say sorry.Well, because she did not, now the restaurant itself can become more popular, thanks to me.The food is nice there. No problems ok.There was a stuff sitting beside me, having her break. Obviously, if she is wearing their official t-shirt she must watch what she is doing. but she did not care.Guess what.....she was cutting her nails! and they were flying all over the place!After I approached counter to check if she belongs here, they said yes, and one of them come out to tell her to stop. And then those 2 spoke in their own language and laughed! and no one said sorry.Nice service ladies.BTW they never even wipe the table after her nails were nicely laying down ther

You need to try this one out if you like to eat wraps or salads. We were in kind of a hurry to catch a movie and stumbled by this place at the Ion and got blown away by all of the choices available. The wraps are huge and there's even a few dough flavours to choose from such as lemongrass. Staff was nice and seemed happy which is not the norm in fast-foodish restaurants around Asia. The only thing that could be better is that the some of the dishes could have a bit more meat in them - they tend to be a bit more about the veggies than protein. Will definitely visit again

If you are looking for a healthy bite to eat when you are out and about, Simply Wrapps is a good place to start.The food is good and healthy with plenty of options for either a salad or a wrap from either a menu or do-it-yourself options.With so many food options on offer in Singapore, it was nice to have a simple salad from this venue
5
Excellent Salads and Wraps everytime. I visit the new outlet at Ion at least 2 to 3 times a week. Staff are very good. I enjoyed my visit today especially since I was not to sure if I will like the mango chicken and without asking the male staff; provided me a taste on a piece of lettuce which I feel was a great gesture to a frequent customer..makes me just want to keep going back to this outlet at Ion.The staff are courteous and they know how to get the customer moving along and out within a few minutes.Keep up the excellent job

A good variety of wraps but instead of long/thin rolled wraps, they are served fat and bulky. It will be quite messy to eat as the sauces will be dripping when one bites on their wrap. Challenging to eat elegantly and decently.
5
It might be take-away, but forget about Subway as it's way above that standard. You choose your fillings and come away with a large, delicious wrap at $10.00SGD. So tasty after so much restaurant food on this trip.

Was a bit fed up of eating noodle and rice based dishes in Singapore so it was refreshing to find this place in the mall.The wraps are made fresh in front of you and you choose the wrap type (from plain to different flavours) and there's plenty of fresh salad in them (had the Taj Mahal wrap). It is also halal with no pork or lard used.The wraps are very large and bulky and adequate for an evening meal. We ordered crisps as well but didn't need them when we saw how big the wraps were.Fresh, different, value for money and worth a visit
3
Located in the heart of Singapore, this is a perfect spot for a quite healthy bite. They serve the freshest ingredients and open real early in the day for you to pick up a salad and head to work. I enjoy the custom salads so I don't have to think what to put together

In Plaza Singapura, Dhoby Ghaut, the new branch of Simply Wrapps is a sanctuary in a city of rich, intensely flavoured decadent, dishes or fattening unhealthy fast foods chains from either malls, stalls, or restaurants. Simply Wrapps offers fresh clean flavours of a vast verity of salad ingredients. Basically there are 15 set salads that can also be taken as a lightly toasted wrap ( wholemeal, spinach, lemongrass for example ) I think there are five wrap choices. And of course you can design your own salad/wrap.Both salad or wrap are significant in size and could be two meals for small eaters. So cut the wrap in half for easier eating. The sauces of salads that I have tasted ( tuna lover, Caesar , Norwegian ) have lots of flavour. But more fish in the fish salads please! Caesar had a refreshingly hearty portion of chicken for a change. Average price $11 per dish. Fresh fruit juices are offered with no added sugar or ice. And there are breakfast options I have not tried yet. I just love this rare addictively healthy option in an overwhelming choice of chain eateries in Singapore.Rising in popularity it is getting harder to get a seat at peak times. They also have a catering menu. Staff levels are good, they are upbeat, competent , polite and keep the place clean and functional. None of this staff 'working' between playing on their phones! My pet hate.Yes this now my got-to healthy and satisfying option. A much needed boost for Plaza Singapura's restaurant facility. With a just hand full of excellent restaurants our food experience here has been generally disappointing. I have several images but this TripAdvisor app is not very functional

Usually we have Subways sandwiches on the go and take out.However, being at the ION Singapore (12.09.2015) in the late evening, I was looking for somehting for supper that was not too heavy and rich.Came across Simply Wrapps at the ION Singapore and halted in my tracks. You have two choices - as a salad or as a wrap. While ingredients are fresh and wholesome, what came across in my mind as a veggie / salad outlet.For Muslims - it is No Pork or Lard. Hence is Halal for you should you be hungry for a bite or two.I ordered three different wraps.1. The Tandoori Chicken.Most disappointing as the chicken was tasteless and not alot.The veggies that went into the wrap overpowered the chicken pieces.2. The Mango Chicken.This was the most interesting of all wraps. Interesting and juicy.Two thumbs up with the three of us.3. Sorry, the last wrap (I forgotten its name) was on average.Eventhough we asked to hold the red kidney beans, the person making the wrap failed to adhere to the plain and clear instructions given at the counter beforehand.It was best eaten with soup - clam chowder. The wrap and its ingredients into the soup.While price range was alittle steep - S$10.90 for each salad / wrap, a word of caution. Choose wisely the wrap and what fillings you like best. I think as a salad on its own would be much better than as a wrap. Even at McDonalds / Kentucky - their salads are half the price and more tasteful chicken

There are not many places in the center of Singapore where you can easily get fresh salads with various ingredients. This is one of those places. During the lunch hours you may have to queue a bit. In the "Tuna lovers salad" there should have been more tuna itself and not just mainly spinach and beans. The "Martins delight" with chicken was very good. The choice of drinks could have been larger.

Approx. $10 for a fresh wraps, i would say it is quite a good value of money for a wrap at its size. It is far better than Subway ... lots of variety to choose from, just that the q will get longer after 12 noon and it is hard to get a seat there

The first thing that gets your attention at Simply Wrapps is the super long line if you're there after 12pm! What's fantastic though is the efficiency and level of service - the staff here is very fast and perpetually in good humour. There's an extensive menu as well as a make your own option. I tried the Mexican Fiesta veggie wrap (Wholemeal wrap choc a bloc with Romaine, Avocado, Kidney beans, Jalapeno, Cheddar Cheese, and a tangy Avocado dressing) while my friend had an Iron rich wrap (Spinach wrap with Baby Spinach, feta, Chickpeas, Kidney Beans, Raisins, and a light Cranberry dressing). Both wrap were fresh and delicious, and despite being stuffed from end to end, were light on the stomach. I also got a Daily Dose juice - carrot, orange, and apple, which was tangy and refreshing - no sugar and no ice!This is a great place for a healthy and quick lunch or dinner, definitely recommend it

Dropped in for dinner one evening, still finding our feet in Singapore. You don't have to pay lots for meals here; just shop around. These wrap(p)s were delicious and healthy too. We couldn't eat the entire wrap (I am a big eater) so they kindly provided a wrapping service to take the remainder home. They were just as healthy the next day. Well done
