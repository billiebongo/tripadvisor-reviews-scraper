Reasonable prices. Giving Aston a run for the money. Great service. Wide selections of food. Portion a bit small if you are a big eater.

The place has been renovated and is more spacious. Good thing is that water is still free and service is still prompt.

The standard of the food have drop and the choices of side dishes decreases too. It use to have 5-10 side dishes but now it drop all the way to 5 or lesser.
Back then it was way better.

Having finished a walk in the Bukit Timah Reserve we were very happy to cool down in the Plaza and have a great meal. We both had fish and chips which was very filling. Good staff, helpful and cheerful. Clean, neat and tidy. Well patronised

Good western food with reasonable price. Their set lunch is affordable with main course, soup and drinks at $9.90. Plenty of side dished to go together with main course

Freshly cooked western food in a cosy unpretentious environment. Affordable yet tasty meals for the whole family. Not a place for fancy occasions but perfect when you just want predictable comfort food.

Free water (ice or warm) but you just to pour to yourself. Hard to find places that serve free water these days.Service is good and portion of food is good too. Prices are very reasonable as well.Place is quite spacious so should be pretty easy to find a table. Nice retro photos of Michael Jackson as well.

We have been here many times over the years. This place is quite old & pretty simple, has a relaxing homely laid back atmosphere & serves no frills good Western food at reasonable prices.The location is an old shopping centre, which further enhances the "old"ambience. What we really love about this place is the "old, homely, unrushed" & serene ambience; where we can just slowly enjoy a good meal

We went here for lunch. Being from Australia, I have not particularly enjoyed 'Western' dining in Singapore a lot because it's simply not Western food. However, the food here, in some ways, was rather good. The Caesar Salad ($6.90) with Chicken (+$2) ws big and delicious. The steak & cheese sandwich ($9?) was pretty good - poor sized serving of fries and the bread was a hotdog roll, but overall not terrible. My partner (Singaporean) got the lunch special ($9.90) and you could choose from chicken or fish, in different styles. We got the pan seared fish. The set lunch comes with 2 sides (ie; vege, baked potato, fries, rice, onion rings) and a soup/garlic bread (mushroom or minestrone) and a drink (iced tea, tea or coffee). The fish was terrible, in my opinion, but my partner said that's what to expect at these places. He said the sides were good. We though the soup wasn't toooo bad. And the iced tea was a nice side.Overall, they don't charge service charge, just GST, which is nice and we paid $30 total
