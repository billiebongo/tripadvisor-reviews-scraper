Waited 20 minutes minutes for 2 deserts - seems the young staff are not very efficient and professional but that’s alright when you want to close soon . Maybe ?

Been to the one at Jurong Westgate. Ordered their Green Tea Bingsu (my fav) & Injeolmi Bingsu. Yummy! The ice is smooth and well mixed. Keep it up!

The cafe is quite quiet even on the weekends so it's a great place to have good conversations with friends over a dessert. I had the strawberry bingsu, it was good! What impressed me was I initially wanted to order a mango bingsu and service staff actually advised me that the mangoes were sour that day and recommended the strawberry flavor instead. Great service:

Went to the orchard central one as it was close to apartment and looked better than the Ice Lab outside. Quite pricey (but similar prices in the area) but if you havn't tried smooth snow-like ice that melts in your mouth its definitely worth the try! Ordered the popular green tea bingsu and was not disappointe

Nunsaram offers bingsu (fluffy Korean shave ice) with different toppings as well as milk/soy milk/yogurt bases to choose from. The dessert sizes (regular or large) or good for sharing with friends, as is the seating in the restaurant. The only drawback is that they don't offer water to guests
4
It was an impromptu decision to try the bingsu. Was recommended to try the chocolate flavoured. The rice cakes, thinly shaved ice, even the ice cream were tasty and complement the taste buds entirely. At $14.90, I would say it was a good deal. Definitely going back for more.

First tried bingsu in O'Ma Spoon and I was impressed. But then I was told by my son (who's been based in Singapore for 5 years) that the bingsu in Nunsaram is even better. Honestly, maybe I am not that discerning to know the difference because both to me are excellent bingsus anyway. What i like about Nunsaram though is that you can ask for more and more condensed milk to pour over your bingsu. I will go back there. I really enjoyed it

I went to the outlet at Orchard Central. Personally, I feel the place is quite small and cramp. But the Ice was good, it was smooth, and it wasn’t that icy cold that could hurt your tooth, and it melts in your mouth once you put it in. We ordered Mango bingsu (mango Ice Cream), sweet potato bingsu (Vanilla Ice Cream), spicy tteogkkoji, and cheese tteogkkoji. Comparing mango and sweet potato bingsu, I would prefer mango, as the fruit is a little sour, after you pour in the condensed milk and mix it up, the taste blends well. As for tteogkkoji, I would prefer the cheese one, when you put it your mouth you can taste a slight sweetness of the tteogkkoji, after that the savoury of the cheese will come and ‘Yum’

Went to the one at United Square after dinner with kids. One of the better ones i tried so far and slightly less pricey. Smooth and melts in mouth. The serving was good for 3 kids and 2 adults.will head back again for more Bingsu
5
It was my third time here and this time we had the matcha bingsu with layers of green tea powder and red bean. Every scoop was filled with chunky beans and pillowy soft ice flakes. Still good as always. Only thing I had wished was that if it had come with mochi, it would be even better!We went at 9pm on a friday night and it was packed to the brim

Went to the cafe at Westgate 3rd floor. Second time here. Ordered greentea bingsu @ SGD13.90. Taste good. Had to during dinner time, otherwise no seats available.

Another Korean Dessert choice. Tried the honey bread and it is good choice. Mixed of cold whip cream and hot bread feeling
4
I saw this place at United SQUARE was always full of customers and wondering how good is it. A few weeks ago I decided to give it a shot. The Mango Bingsu was so nice. The shredded ice was so different from from Thai and Chinese dessert places. It was a lot smoother and just melt in my mouth. The Mango was sweet and sour as I liked. Dressing syrup wasn't too sweet. Definitely I will return for more.

First time trying Korean desserts. Chose black sesame bingsu. It was a huge serving and took two of us quite a while to finish. The very fine ice and the light flavours were a delight to the palate.Enjoyed it more than my usual ice kacang but then it cost a lot more too

Visited two outlets over the year, one at Orchard Central and the other at the Novena outlet. Bingsu was very good with the fluffy kind of 'snowflakes'. But I would prefer a bigger portion hence OC, instead of the one at Novena (which served only petit size) as ingredients still went in deeper for a bigger bowl bingsu
4
Tried the sweet potato bingsu and it's not bad, but there's too much whipped cream on every bowl of bingsu served. Also, there're much lesser ingredients than the Bingsu place located just next door, aka O'ma Spoon. Overall it's not bad but not the best I've tried.

In Summary:Unless you need a bingsu quick-fix, I will go for Oma spoon anyday.*DETAILED REVIEW BELOW*Background:I went to the Jurong branch instead, which is located in Westgate.1. Service – 1 out of 5To be honest, service is non-existent. But you do not go to such a place for their service! I really wonder why we have to collect and return the bowls ourselves when there is an excess of service crew members who are chatting incessantly.2. Ambience – 3 out of 5Once again, one does not visit these places for their ambience. Place is located in the middle of the shopping mall on level 5.3. Cleanliness – 3.5 out of 5The queue indicator (for the lack of a better name. It is the black thing that vibrates and makes an irritating beep when your food is ready) and tray is often sticky. Service crew can do better to clean up little things like this instead of chatting away.4. Taste – 3.5 out of 5Decent, but not the best5. Value for Money - 3 out of 5Not cheap at about $13 a bowl at the very least. But with young students coming in flocks to enjoy this new craze with their pocket money, I stand corrected

I tried the Patbingsu, which is the red bean bingsu at the Westgate outlet. The rice cake is good and there are smaller pieces of rice cake incorporated under the ice. Red bean topping is slightly little though. The stall offers free drinking water and is self-service. When I visited the stall, there were not many people as it was after lunch hours. It is free-seating and you can choose where you want to sit. One point I noticed about the culture of this dessert café was that we have to return our bowls and trays once we finished the desserts. However, the place to return our tray is right beside the counter and the same counter where you order your desserts. It was unsightly to see leftover bingsu or empty bowls when I placed my order at the counter

We tried the Red Bean Bing Su. It's not bad but certainly not the best that we have tried. The café premise is open concept, simple design but still comfortable. This mall is pretty quiet especially on the higher floors. Even on weekends.Quite a relaxing place though to just sit & enjoy your Bing Su slowly.Surprising to see so many staff( 7 teens- think all Korean girls as heard them speaking) for a small café like this

Have tried this place several times on many occasions. The patbingsu is always nice and refreshing after a hot day. However, there are many instances where the service is still not there yet. We were making payment when we were just counting money to pay to the cashier and she kept on repeating the price when we are just counting the money to ourselves. But overall, once service wise picks up, I'm pretty sure this place can be one of the best that served Patbingsu in Singapore. For now, there may still be a long way to go
