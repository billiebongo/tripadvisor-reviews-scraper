I had a late lunch here and was supposedly famished. Heard lots of good things about this place, especially their laksa pasta. But I didn't want carbs. Ordered the fish instead. Presentation was good but the fish is not fresh. Disappointed.

They offered variety of option in the menu - Western, Chinese, Malay food. If not mistaken, all food are halal. The overall atmosphere is good, great to hang out with group of friends. Highly recommended on their burgers & dessert! My favourite dessert is Banana Fritter with Gula Melaka! slurp

Came in for dinner 2pax, good atmosphere, neat and tidy. Food was tasty and there's variety of unique food. The combination of east and west was well executed. Definitely will come back to dine again! Was attended by yang and faizz who was the server who attended to us. Good food recommendation! Service: Good welcome greetings, smiley staff and polite

Flava is a welcomed addition to the East. It has an extensive halal menu which sounds and looks enticing. Nice deco with indoor and outdoor seating. Service was good though food took time even though the restaurant was not crowded.It's burgers won a Burpple award but I am not a burger person. They also serve great ice cream. Kapiti (from New Zealand) which for me spells delicious!!We had the special Beef tataki served with rice and miso soup. Rice was overcooked and came lukewarm like the oversalty miso soup. But staff were attentive and kindly replaced soup and rice but how do you resurrect poorly cooked food? The hot pot chicken was pretty decent and came piping hot.While they seem to have the makings of a good eatery. Variety and well designed menu, good staff, modern laid back ambience, some fine tuning is needed at this one year old restaurant food wise. Less ambitious on the variety perhaps unless it can be done well.If I do return, I would like to try the burgers and leave room for some quality ice cream

Came to this restaurant thanks to a friend's recommendation. The food, with exception for the Grilled Salmon with Mango Salsa that turned out to be overcooked, was simply amazing! Would like to recommend everyone to try the Tebasaki Chicken Burger, Szechuan Duck Pasta, and Crispy Crab Pasta. I would love to visit again with my family

Nice ambience, decent service, great neighborhood asset. We had K-Pop burger, Peking duck with steamed buns, scoop of snicker ice cream, mint iced-tea and coffee. All of it was pretty good, innovative, nicely presented food. An exhaustive menu is a good reason to visit again.It's halal restaurant so no alcohol or pork

My weekly night dates with my wife brings us to FLAVA! Well by accident really. We were just looking for a place to have dinner along Siglap and we decide to walk the street a bit further and we found this place!The setting is nicely done, lighting was not too dim nor too bright.(They have outdoor sitting as well)We had the Smoke Salmon & Avocado Salad, Chicken Cordon Bleu, Double Scoop Waffle. Drinks we had Flat White Coffee & Strawberries & Basils.The food was full of flavour, and the Strawberries & Basils are apparently the crowd favourite
