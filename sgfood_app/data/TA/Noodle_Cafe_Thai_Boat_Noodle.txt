This is our favorite place for boat noodles... Portion is just nice. Love the fresh pork slices, usually have it mixed with the pork balls.
My favorite combination is tomyam soup, mixed pork, less spicy with glass noodles 👍👍👍👍

We were walking the bazard and came upon this place, the place look great, the decor is beautiful, not what you expect to find there. food: amazing and at a very cheap price. Get plenty of different soups (it is small portions) and share, The other dishes are also fantastic. Nice discover

My friend asked me one Friday evening if I wanna eat something good. Of course I said yes right away! And so my friend brought me first time to Golden Mile Complex (This is such an uncharted place for me even having lived here in Singapore for 4 years now).Nearest MRT stations are Nichol Highway (Circle Line) and Lavender (East-West Line).I did not expect the place to be so crowded, buzzing with activities, chaotic, grungy... but all these just adds to the novelty of the area. So much to see, hear and experience.We went straight to the basement where the Restaurant is located. We did not wait long for us to get seated. Maybe we arrived just in time before people started pouring in for dinner. The place is small, a bit hot and stuffy even if there's aircon and fans.We ordered the Thai Boat Noodles, choose the usual flat rice noodles, selected our toppings (My friend got pork balls, and I got pork slices), select the level of spiciness (My friend warned me earlier that the spiciness level is quite fierce, so we both opted for the less spicy), and ordered some more pork balls on the side.We were both sweating like hell because of the spiciness. I love it, don't get me wrong. I wondered then how spicy is regular spicy to them. We ended the fantastic meal with thai milk tea for drinks.I have tried other thai boat noodles (In a nicer place at that) but I'd say, this one is the best I've had so far. It is not just spicy soup that goes along with the noodles and meat toppings. The soup itself is busting with flavors. Even this restaurant is located in such kind of place, I told myself and my friend, that I won't mind coming back if I knew how good what I'll be having.The prices may come a bit high for some, but I'd say for the value and service that they offer, It was definitely all worth it. So value for money is a big YES!Truly a hidden gem tucked at the basement of the Golden Mile Complex

Very close to authentic thai boat noodles like those found in street cafes or pushcarts all over Thailand. Small servings (pork or beef) @ S$1.90 per bowl are adequate for starters and those who want to try everything from the menu.. down with a glass of the famous Thai Milk Tea... aroy mak mak !

I was in Golden Mile Complex on Sunday with my family for some grocery shopping. We had dinner at Thai Boat Noodle and my wife ordered a bowl of Chicken Noodles Soup and i was shocked when she told me that it cost SGD6.00!! We ate this all the time in Bangkok and it costs only 35 Baht (SGD1.40). Inflation at more than 3 times in Singapore, this is too crazy and the portion of the noodles is only a fraction of what the local noodles in Singapore. This is definitely too expensive for even singaporeans, not to mention Thais! The price should be at an affordable SGD3.00 or at max SGD3.50! It is hard to convince me to eat for this price again

This the first time i am trying this place after reading good reviews regarding its golden mile outlet. I love thai beef noodles but the thought of pig"s blood in thailand makes me squirmish.... I ordered the normal sized bowl with sen lek( thin rice noodles) mixed with beef slices and beef balls. I went for the non spicy as there was chilli flakes provided. The soup was dark and " heavy" but i like it. Does not taste too salty. Which is good. The thai fish cakes were of good quality- juicy, springy yet not too oily. The chilli sauce provided was potent!

i tried both the special sauce and dry version of the noodle. it was a bit too salty for me, it did remind me of BANGKOK though. To be fair, I think they deserve a second chance for a better rating, at least for me. I will definitely go back again, and i will make sure i go there with a more empty stomach and my target will be >5 bowls !!! by the way, thumb up to their thai milk tea !

The staff intro my friend (first timer), about the thai boat noodle, so that they know what they are ordering, repeated telling us the size so that we are aware of the small portion, food is as good as what is served in Thailand, no wonder so popula
