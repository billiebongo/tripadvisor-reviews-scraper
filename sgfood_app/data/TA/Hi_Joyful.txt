Great food and good place for gathering. A young served us and very attentive. After she knock off the other staff very friendly. And the most unbelievable thing is payment by cash only.

This is my first time visiting Hi Joyful. Food is yummy but a little pricey. Tables are small and not enough space to eat.

In the smith st food area, it is good value and good food. Beware the spicy prawns are spicy, very spicy but so nice. Price was reasobale and they had nice cold beer to wash down the spice.

Delicious seafood for a good value with a lot of variety, worth the money when eating with family. A must try.

Fresh & nice seafood. Very big portion as well. There are drinks in light bulb & milk bottle. Can sing karaok and play arcade games as well. Nice experience.

At $40 a head, you get a huge spread of seafood (lobsters, crabs, prawns, clams, mussels, oysters, etc.), steamed and served in a large tray, soaked in a delicious broth. It can get quite warm though, would suggest to dress light.

It was an awesome experience. Seafood was fresh and in big portion. The ambience was good. We enjoyed the seafood and Karaoke session.

I went there to try the famous Singapore Chilli Crab and I wasn't disappointed! It was the best crab I ever had! I think the price was reasonable given the quality, but I can't compare with other restaurants in Singapore. They also have a large seafood selection as well as other meat, chicken and veggie options. And right in the middle of China Town. Definitely recommended

We tried Seafood Combo with Original Soup Base, soup was bland right until we finished all the food. Crawfish were small, not much meat. One of the 2 crabs was not fresh, had mushy flesh. However, clams were really big & fleshy. We also ordered Spicy Diced Chicken (辣子鸡) which was good. Mapo Tofu was more like a toned down version of Mala Tofu - no good. Frog Leg (泡椒田鸡) was ok. Fried Calamari tasted like surimi, not authentic squid ring. Service was swift though
