Dim sum is average. Fried shrimp is ok. Better order all in-front, if you place additional order you might get it very late. Can be reached by bus line number 2. The prices is just a little bit more then average hawker stall.

Been visiting this resty quite often as it offers a wide range of menu from western to Chinese, malay and Indian cuisine. The standard of tze char (local term for Chinese dishes) are above average and the nasi lemak is good with hot fresh fried chicken wings

Their menu is huge and you will be spoilt for choices! This is always a great suggestion for dinner with friends who are either visiting Singapore or for new colleagues who have just moved to the country. Portions are huge for affordable prices and tasty dishes. I was here last week for a casual company dinner and we ordered about 20 dishes for table of 15 hungry adults. We left feeling famished and with happy stomachs! Some of the dishes we ordered were: Chilli Crabs, Salted Egg Yolk Crabs (with Sauce), Fried Salted Egg Yolk Crabs, Sambal Stingray (this was great!), Sambal Sotong (I loved it! They cooked it with Tumeric which added a nice aftertaste), Seafood Fried Rice, Cereal Prawn (everyone enjoyed it!), Kangkung Belachan, Fried Baby Squid and Super Cooler (a mocktail of coconut water and pandan extract). Highly recommended if you are in the area!Note: It is a very casual restaurant, so please do not expect attentive service and the restaurant to have the same level of cleanliness as a fine-dining, Michelin-starred listing. Otherwise, the food is great

There are a lot of menus to choose from. This time we ordered tomyam, baby kailan with oyster sauce and lemon chicken. We also ordered pratha coin which is a must try! The price was ok, a bit pricey but worth it. Nothing is cheap in Singapore anyway! Easiest way to get here is by bus or just take Uber

I happened to pass by this cafe and thinking to give it a try. It is consider crowded at night. It serves not only hong kong dim sum stuff but also local Malay and Indian delicacy.i went day during brunch time and it has less people, completely different from the night time. I tried the dim sum - steam custard bun, it is average. I had roti bom - very nice and Ikan Bilis fried rice - average

If you have a group of people with different tastebuds, this would be a good place to visit. It has a wide choice of menu ranging from dimsums, Indian, Malay to Western. It's al-fresco dining with a canopy just in case it rains. Food presentation was good and price was cheap. I most appreciate the service. Everyone was smiley and some even tried to entertain the kids. Its open from 10am to 6am so you can practically have any meal of the day there :
