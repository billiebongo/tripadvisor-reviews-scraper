This is a favourite for my family and we do eat here for dinner from time to time. Prices have went up for the past few years but it is still affordable. I especially like the flavoured meats that they cook.

The seafood especially the crabs are very fresh and taste delicious like the Fried Yam Crab.The tofu is very soft even after it is being deep fried.Will love to try again!

We went early and got a really nice table and The area is airy so it was very pleasant instead of humid and stuffy places and other places. The highlight was the salted egg crab. It has the Indian-like crispy "muruku" which is a very nice touch to the dish. Of course the chili crab is as good as I can remember this recipe. The "hor fun" flat rice noodle was another good item here. Definitely must come back again if around ten Jurong East area!!

My parents and I went there for seafood. The place is windy during night. We had Bamboo Clam and 2 crabs.. The salted egg crab and garlic bamboo clam were very delicious but not the pepper crab. ..it was too salty and not much of the pepper.

Stopped by here and had the steamed (lazy) fish, coconut shrimp, and the bamboo clams. The food is prepared well and is very tasty. The sitting area is nestled between two buildings kind of like a hawker food court. The sitting area is covered and there was a good breeze present in the evening so it was comfortable. Be careful ordering as it is easy to get more food than you can eat
