Good atmosphere and ambience and crowd. Perfect for friends, family and dates . Quality of food is good.
5
Great ambience and view for a night out catching up with friends over drinks and food ! Highly recommended !
3
Ambience was perfect, food was so so however service was lacking. I would say the service was quite badly delivered as waiter shows no interest in service. For example, while taking order waiter was leaning on the other table, while serving the food he left the food and go with no eye contact nor any communication.
4
Decided to go to the Fullerton outlet because my friend said the river view was nice. Not disappointed! We took the furthest table outside. She said she had heard the food wasn't nice, glad we were proven wrong. This is a good place for big eaters though. The staff that attended to us were very helpful and efficient as well.

This restaurant is popular due to its convenient location along the Fullerton Bay Hotel Waterfront facing the Marina Bay. It is also an excellent photo spot for a good view of the entire Marina Bay Sands building.It offers Alfresco Dining Facilities, coupled with Happy Hour 1-for-1 Promotion for their 1 pint Beer. When we were there on a Tuesday evening, the Alfresco seats were all occupied. We managed to get indoor seating in lounge type seats.We ordered few appetisers and one main course. The beef patty is slightly overcooked for medium standard.Overall, it was a relaxing dine in experience at the waterfront
4
Suitable restaurant for all sorts of occasions -good food and great service. The outdoor seats have a scenic view of the Singapore river and the music is tasteful. If you go on someone's birthday you also get a complimentary waffle and ice cream! but make sure you ask for it, as they will not serve it of you don't (learnt the hard way!). Surprisingly had a vegan salad that was quite impressive for an American Diner restaurant -but definitely go for the milkshakes, burgers and sweet potato fries
3
Service although polite and courteous, could be a bit more prompt and attentive. It wasn't terribly crowded on a Sunday sunny afternoon and the drinks we ordered took more than a reasonable amount of time. Ambience of the place was good though. We didn't have any burgers there so cannot comment on them. Outside seating is available and it faces the Marina Bay, which can be nice on evenings and overcast, cloudy days
4
OverEasy was great in a few areas. Service was top notch with lots of smile to distribute around. Food was marvelous as well and most of all is the stunning view of the Marina Bay Sand. This is the closest view you can get opposite of MBS. It won't be easy to get the seats outside especially during peak period. So I guess we just have to do what most Singaporean does - Kiasu (scare to lose) by booking early for the ideal seating.
5
I came to OverEasy past midnight and the staff were sprightly and really attentive. Chiara attended to me with an affectionate smile and ever ready heart to serve. One of the best places Iâ€™ve been so far, with tip top customer service and prompt response to all clients. Do give them your support!!
3
Set lunch at OverEasy is quite worth it (since the burger on its own on the ala carte menu is about the same price as the whole set menu lunch). Only complain is that the meat in my burger was a bit dry. Other than that, nice place but definitely have to book during lunch because it can be quite crowded.
5
The restaurant serves great american fare and the service was great. Would visit again in the future
4
This is my second visit to this restaurant and I absolutely love the Mac and cheese. I love the menu at this restaurant and the location is fantastic
5
Good service from Hui Yee, Diana and Arthur making Overeasy a very pleasant place to chill after a long dayâ€™s work. Keep it up
5
Went there for lunch with my friends on the weekday.We ordered a 2-course set meal each, which works out to be $30 per person after gst and service charge.Clam chowder was great, so is the burger. Staff was proactive too
5
We went here with our family of 12 and made a reservation for an outdoor table. We were not disappointed. The view was fabulous. The service was great. The milkshakes were a big hit with our family and we tried one in every flavor. We enjoyed the chicken special and the burgers were great
4
service speed could be better, but the courteousness of the staff was much appreciated. The beer would be better if served colder
4
Food and drinks here were delicious. It is a bit pricy but you would expect that for the location. Definitely best to get a table outside so you can enjoy the view. Service was great, would recommend the wings and strawberry mojito
2
Food was good. We had buffalo wings and burger. Service was incredible bad. Didn't get the lunch menu, offered the worst table due to we were only two. It took almost an hour and we couldn't finish second course. Staff fully unmotivated. The one who looked bossy did not care about our unhappyness. Look for other places to enjoy your day.
5
First time there, loving the food and scenery. Pricing was affordable for a restaurant by the bay. Will definitely be back again
5
All of the food we ordered was really good, but the beer can roasted chicken was off the hook. I want to go back just for that dish
1
I made a reservation via Chope couple weeks prior to my booking and when we got there they had no record of my booking which was embarrassing and frustrating because we were there for a birthday celebration. We had the birthday girl with us and it wasn't a pleasant start to our day. I saw a table with a "reserved" tag on it and I wanted that spot but it was occupied at the time. In my mind, technically if I made a reservation, those reserved tables should be reserved for customers who did. So I politely asked the hostess if the patron sitting at that reserved table had booked that table and she said no. I asked if she could ask him to nicely to move to another table for customers who actually made a booking. The way she handled my request was rude and honestly left a very bad impression and we havent even seated down yet!!!!! Honestly, this would be my last visit to OverEasy at Fullerton.
5
We were here for celebration farewell for our colleague for the second time. We book the outdoor instead of indoor. The view was amazing and stunning facing to Marina Bay Sands. Food was great and the service was fast and friendly. We will be back for another rounds for celebration. Hopefully i will get the membership card since we are very regular.
4
Food is good and service is good. Environment is great as if you dine at outdoor, MBS night view is just right opposite the restaurant. Great place to hang out with friends colleagues or business partner
4
Came on a recommendation from a friend without checking the menu. We both went for lunchtime burgers which were nice. The restaurant was nice and airy with a good amount of indoor and outdoor space and a decent view of the harbour. Our food was good at a reasonable price of about Â£50 for 2 meals and soft drinks. I found the service ok but not amazing
4
The ambience was great. Overlooking the Marina Bay Sands. Service is exceptional. We requested to change tables 3 times, they were patient and understanding allowing us to do so
5
Excellent food , big portions and great ambience with an awesome view. Will come back again for sur
3
Came back here for a few beers in late November with a friend. The place was very crowded this time and it wasn't so easy to get a table. But service was still quite efficient and the beers were cold. It was somehow lacking in atmosphere relative to my last visit
4
A little bit pricey, but if you can get a table by the water, you have a fantastic view all night long.The cocktails are very good, with lots to choose from. I haven't tried the food, but again there are plenty of options
3
I have been to the Wheelock branch previously and enjoyed my time there, service was extraordinary and food was pretty good. However, the Fullerton branch was a disappointment, the food was overly salty and laden with MSG, I could not stop dunking down water hours after my visit and service was subpar with servers who looked like they'd rather be elsewhere. Disappointing really, the ambience was ace but was pulled down by the service and food. I'd advice you to go next door to PS Cafe instead.
3
It's nothing special - the food and service are nice enough, but it doesn't stand out in Singapore where there are so many great eateries
4
We had a good time. Reserved outside sofa table for the 4 of us. The service was quick for drinks and food. We had the chips and lobster tots. The girls had waffle chicken and we shared the lobster Mac and cheese. Portions were good.The only thing is that it took forever to get our bill. But overall very good place. The view of MBS is amazing
5
Great place especially after revamp. Service is great, food is awesome, will be back again. Love the new open spacious concept with the American bar counter . The outdoor seats have a great view too!
3
We love a good burger and search for good ones no matter where we travel. Claiming to have the best burgers in Singapore made this place hard to pass up. It started off well with 1 for 1 beers, then we got the menu. I noticed they only had two burger options, amusing for somewhere that claims to have the best! I ordered the 'to die for' burger, my partner selected the chicken sandwich (which actually came out on a burger bun?!). Was an ok burger but nothing amazing unfortunately. The chicken sandwich looked great but I'm sorry to say that I think the chicken burger I had from KFC the day prior was better. The fries were nothing special.Sorry Over easy, I really wanted this to be amazing
4
My go-to with new friends, for after work cheeky drinks or would even recommend for dates! Perfect location - with view, good happy hour promo daily 1-1 (5.30 to 8.30 PM) and occasional food promo which is exciting! Mostly American diner bar food and main plates, however they don't take these for granted. Food comes in big portions and basically - their atmosphere is very friendly, vibrant and great to be at! I come back here every week for small drinks and bites with friends after work. MUST GO!
4
Great view, and the food and drinks are also great. Service is quite horrible though when the place is full.The spicy wings have a off menu level 10. Try it if you dare
5
This particular venue of OverEasy ticks all the boxes - scrummy food, good service and of course, an amazing view.
3
Came across Over Easy while out for a walk along the waterfront. There are about 5 restaurants along the walkway at Fullerton 1, sushi, Chinese, Italian, etc, good location. Thought I would try Over Easy, ordered their Wagyu cheeseburger, which was quite good. Meat was nicely seasoned and cooked medium rare, juicy and tasty! Only issue that I had was that they melted the cheese to long or at too high a heat so there was no cheese left on the bun or the burger, it had all dripped off. But they did put the lettuce under the burger to keep the bottom bun from getting too soggy. Eat at Over Easy again, yes
5
Food and services provided by the staffs was good. Enjoyed the overall experience. Love their milkshakes
5
Love this place! Hubby and I have been patronising this restaurant for a couple of times and they never disappoint.
5
Fuss free reservation and confirmation 1 day before actual event. Overeasy accommodated me when I arrived early and required fewer seats after. They also had a fun reservation card that was one of the joking points for the night so great experience overall
5
I had my ROM ceremony at Overeasy and the staffs are very helpful. They had arranged a good location. Great food and we all had wonderful memory
4
We chanced upon this resto while walking along the Merlion area and it was scorching hot so I badly needed a super cold beer. Checking their menu I saw “Eggslut sandwich” (if I remember the name correctly) and ordered it. It exceeded way beyond my expectations! Egg was super creamy and cooked just right! It was really a protein packed meal and the shoestring fries had a sweet taste to it. Service was great too! Serving sizes are good for sharing for those who can’t finish a regular sized burger like me. Overall experience was great!
5
This place is amazing! We had the lobster tater tots, eggslut sandwich and smashed avocado toast. The tots were perfect, especially with the aioli. The eggslut was great, I took the bun off but it did not take away any flavor and the caramelized onions literally taste like candy. The avocado toast was filling and beautiful, it sounds plain but it was very flavorful. All of it was insanely delicious and leaves you wanting to much more. It’s a lot of food so you will definitely not leave hungry.
5
Pretty chill place, from the restaurant ambiance to the surrounding view by the marina bay. Food wise pretty decent, and they have a 1 for 1 drinks happy hour offer that runs to 8pm. A good place to chill
1
They recorded my reservation as no show on the chope app. Waiters were quick to ask us to fill feedback form
3
The main reason to come here is the view, especially at night when you can catch a good view of the light show at Marina Bay Sands. For as busy as they were the service was pretty good. The food was alright, it was enjoyable but not really memorable. A few vegetarian options here that were good, my favorite was the truffle mac n cheese
5
Fantastic service, sincere servers. Value for money.Shout out to Dragon and Arthur for being really attentive and helpful
5
A great place to hang out, to chill. Truffle Mac and cheese is awesome! A must try! Price a little steep but overall is great, with a view of Marina Bay Sands.
4
Ambience is always great @ overeasy, one Fullerton. You get to enjoy the picturesque view of the Marina bay (MBS, Art science gallery, helix bridge etc.) if you come at night, you even get to catch the laser lightshow.Food has its hits & misses. Ordered the chicken & waffles, Grilled cheese & tomato soup, truffle burger (served with truffle fries), 1 chocolate & 1 strawberry milkshake.Milkshakes were great.. Strawberry didn't taste too artificial (a huge pet peeve of mine) & creamy, chocolate was rich in all its magnificent chocolate glory. Only issue was that it couldn't stay cold for too long, probably due to Singapore's heat.. But if it could, that would have been the dream.Grilled cheese tasted great, however the tomato soup was a complete disappointment - it tasted & looked as though someone took a can of tomato puree & just heated it up over a stove. It was extremely a slipshot move to have took the easy way out with the soup.Chicken and waffles was done perfectly I couldn't find fault with that. The truffle burger tasted pretty Good, but the meat patty was overdone which was a pity. What could have been a perfectly juicy medium-doneness burger, ended up being dry and lacklustre.Service was great, they were attentive, thoughtful & polite. Overall, there were some highs and lows, but I'd still give this place a go likely you'll have a better experience than I did.
5
I booked the place from Jakarta and made a special request to give a surprise for my parents. They were very helpful and gave their signature cake for the surprise. The food was great and with reasonable price
4
This restaurant / bar is located on the banks of the Signapore river it has a beautiful view of the famous Marina Bay Sands Resort and the Signapore Flyer. There's inside seating but I prefer the terrace seating in the open as it offers a great view and fresh air.The staff is friendly and were very patient with us as we took some time in deciding what to choose. The menu ranges from starters such as buffalo wings to main dishes with a variety of drinks. The food was tasty and lastly they played their music at the right level. I will definitely recommend this establishment.
4
Great restaurant to meet friends for happy hour. Easy no fuss great ambiance overlooking the marina bay sands.
3
Visited GP qualifying night. Arrived after 1030pm and so restricted menu. Service a little slow once sat down. Wife and son had Mac N Cheese which they enjoyed. I had the "to die for" burger. Yes it was very good. Went back the next night after the GP. Just before 10.30pm and they weren't serving food so left. I mean come on. There are thousands of people walking past
4
The drinks menu was quite extensive & the service was great! Went there for a birthday celebration with friends & it was an enjoyable meal tgt
3
Stumbled into this place with colleagues out of convenience; right on the Bay at One Fullerton. The name should have told me something about the restaurant. However, my colleagues and I were ready for dinner and they had waterfront seating, which is what we were looking for. We all had burgers. I ordered it medium (as I do in the US), and should have ordered a more done temp instead. Food was average, but the view and ambiance were great
5
We have always been impressed with Gelyn's impeccable service. She never fails to greet us and recommend good food to us. She will also find out how we are doing and check whether the food was up to our expectations. We visit OverEasy at least once a week and always hope to see Gelyn. Thanks for your amazing service and kudos for a job well done
5
Had a good table this afternoon. Facing Marina Bay Sands. Love the vibes in this restaurant. The good old Mac n Cheese is still as good. Happy hour deals was awesome!
5
I have been visiting OverEasy Fullerton over the last 2.5 years. Food and service has always been fantastic! Recently, my family and friends threw a surprise celebration in lieu of my birthday at OverEasy. The staff prepared a birthday dessert with over-the-top sparklers and also gifted me a bottle of red wine, knowing that it's my favourite! What touched me the most was the birthday card signed off by the managers and staff. I am so blessed by this gesture and am thankful to the team at OverEasy. A big thank you especially to the managers, Syahrul and Hui Yee, for preparing all these for me! The newly revamped menu tasted amazing as well, all of us throughly enjoyed our night
5
Service was awesome as well as the ambience. Loved it! Had a great time hanging with friends. Shld visit during happy hours
3
Was on holiday and decided to venture away from MBS for something different. The meal was an expensive disappointment. To start with the server forgot a lot of things. The straw, our order, drinks etc... Furthermore we shared beer can chicken. It was offered to be taken to kitchen after presenting to chop into bits. It went missing for 10 mins and came back cold. It literally was a chicken, a few carrots and onion - described as roasted veggies to feed 3
4
Food was good, waiters & waitresses were attentive and friendly. Service was excellent. Waiting time for food and beverages served was quite fast
5
Excellent place for drinks n bar bites, overlooking Singapore skyline.Brought an overseas friend and he enjoyed it
4
To do in Singapore! This bar is around Marina Bay and offers an amazing view on the Marina Bay Sands and its light show. Perfect Location! Very close to the famous Merlion. And among all, the cocktails are very good for a reasonable price (Singapore based). Special highlight for the mini burgers ^
5
Overeasy at One Fullerton Bay never fails to provide good food with good music and good ambience. My Nth time visiting and the review remains thumbs up.
4
Dependable as always for a quick drink or three in the evening. This time it was for business but also happy to come here with friends
4
The food selection on its on isn't something to marvel about. However, Overeasy offers a magnificent view of the Singapore Skyline (Including MBS of course). I was there in the early evening, securing an outdoor seat, and this enabled us to watch the sunset and laser show. Staff members are also very friendly, props to them
5
In A nutshell great place for a family with kids or a young trendy couple except if you are like me and mature but feeling young and love burgers. The basic offering is a lovely burger cooked well done in my case and served on a semi dry bun ( without cheese in my case) and lots and lots of fries. The fries is the Sin of the nights. You can have it plain or with one of many many toppings. Mine was with Chilli com carne. Yummy. ( I did clear out all the chips from the other plates though ) before washing this down with a generous slug of Victoria bitter ( Australian piss). The waiters were young and studenty well mannered and soft spoken efficient and energetic despite the humidity and heat. Ambiance is a lovely mixture of a high class night market ( Pasar Malam in Malay) and a sophisticated promenade spoilt somewhat by the awful music from the establishment next door. The views of the "man made pond backing into the spectacular Marina Bay resort are impressive if a bit " fake" and unnatural. I must say that the laser show was somewhat of an anti climax severely lacking the "wow" factor and somewhat forgettable. So yes to over easy if you want a delightful burger in a fun atmosphere and you are a " fries" addict like me Yummy.
5
Went here with touristing friends on a happy hour and we definitely love it. Food, view and service were topnotch! In addition to beer beverages, we had a sampler of nachos with delish variety of sauces and miniburgers with pulled beef. The staff, particularly Gelyn, was amazing - very accommodating and friendly! We only stayed for an hour but definitely had an excellent service! Highly recommended!
4
Location able to view the MBS and Singapore Flyer. Outdoor and indoor seatings available. Food is good as well with reasonable price considering the venue. Kids friendly and staffs are friendly too! ✌
3
My family and I went to this premium burger restaurant with a wonderful view towards Marina Bay Sands. And if you make it there at 8pm or 9pm you will be able to see all the light effects of the Wonderful Water Show at Marina Bay Sands. It has easy access to the Esplanade theatres.Booking system is given on the spot if restaurant is full. The burgers are great but there is little choice and they cost more than S$20. Burgers are the only good thing on the menu and it is exactly the same thing for the kids menu. When we asked for our receipt, we asked twice to 1 waiter and she simply forgot. Then we asked a different waiter and she said "OK". But we had to ask one more time to get it at last. Total waiting time for the bill: 30 minutes!
4
Excellent view of the Marina Bay Sands. We were there in the evening and sat outdoors. Very breezy and good place to chill. Food and drinks are reasonably priced
5
Good view, saw sunset till night, even saw the Marina Bay laser show. Good food for drinking and many choices of alcohol. Reasonable prices. Outdoor area can smoke.
5
Definitely visit for happy hour and view of the light show. Service from Gelun was amazing and really enjoyed food and drinks
5
We reserved two tables for around 20 people. Gelyn, our server, was excellent- took orders from everyone very quickly. She was friendly and helpful. Food and drinks both came quickly. We had an excellent view of the light show from Marina Bay Sands. Make the most of the happy hour...2 for 1 drinks or $8 mojitos
5
Sliders and burgers were delicious! Also they served the best moscato ever! Outdoor seats have a great view of Singapore's skyline, and you can catch the lights performance over the river to
3
Especially loved the linebacker platter that we ordered! Great scenery awaits when you take the outdoor seats. Definitely worth a visit ;
5
good location for the NDP rehearsals and stunning view of the marina skyline. staff were competent despite a busy night although the kitchen missed out on an order
4
We asked for outdoor sofa but we were given high tables instead. Service was good cuz they called me beforehand to check. But just abit disappointed that they didnt deliver what they promised
1
Service was very slow and they forgot to take one our orders. When they finally brought the order they forgot, they brought the wrong dish. Had to wait another 30 min for the right dish to come. Also, gst and service charge was soaring high, not worth it at all.
4
Good food and good company was coupled with good ambience and view thoroughly enjoyed it aplenty will go bac
4
I had the grilled seabass and my fren had a pastrami sandwich both of which are delicious! A little disappointed they didn't replace my corn as requested. But service was great overall.
5
Excellent location with vibrant atmosphere. Totally perfect for a Friday night out. Service crews were quick and accommodating. The only downside is you take a little while to cool down when siting outdoors.
5
Impressive and attentive service with the right amonth of warmth yet not overbearing in your face, a beautifully decorated and arranged restaurant and food was presented absolutely exquisitely and all of it tasting absolutely divine.
5
The best place for gathering, my family and I very enjoyed with the food and the view, will try to come back after 2 months when my aunt is travelling in Singapore
4
The service was ok but they came out with a surprise birthday cake. Overall experiment was pleasant but slightly expensive.
5
Celebrated my friend's birthday weeks ago. Excellent service by the waitress who tries to fulfill any of our requests and even give good suggestions. Food is ok, vibe is good but waitress' service is the best.
4
Caught up with a few friends for some beers here last week. The happy hour is really quite decent value with 1:1 drinks including Erdinger beer. If you're lucky the stockmarket will be down and then you can also get $1 sliders to accompany your beers. View out over Marina Bay and MBS is good and service is ok
5
Great food, great staff and a great location. Very busy when we arrived so had to take a table inside which was a little disappointing. Just a we ordered the person who had shown us to our table came over and said an outside table was now available. Drinks and food order quickly transferred to a table with a great view just as the Marina Bay Sands light show began. Food was delivered quickly and was great quality. Throughout our meal staff were attentive without being in your face. Never felt rushed. Overall a great evening.
5
I booked the venue for 10+ people for the company's get together. Since i have budget constraints, i asked one of staff to keep the total bills within the limit. She did perfect job to update me time to time! Drinks and food came promptly and friendly staffs. For personal occasion is certainly nice but i would also recommend for team outing events
3
Amazing location, yummy food but probably the app they use to handle orders is a big disaster: they have only one guy running around like hell, while all other waiters are watching the sky and the stars, or walking around cluelessly. It's hard to messup an order with 3 items on a fast-food-like menu: they did it with 2 out of 3!It's a shame because theit formula is nice and taste of the food is great. May give them another chance, but, guys, I want a much better organized service: no luxury, just efficiency
5
We have a birthday surprise for a colleague and the restaurant manager is so friendly to help us in the surprise and provide the best service out of all the restaurants I went. The truffle fries is also very nice.
5
Well done to Shine! Best recommendation from her for the cocktail! Love the warm and friendly service as well! Fantastic place to gather with friends and colleagues! :)
5
Thank you for wonderful birthday surprise. We really enjoyed our dinner with my friends. Special mention to marjorie who served us and made it memorable! ❤️🎈🍻🎊😊😍😍😍😍
4
we had a cool relax after a long month last June, breezy and a different vibe vs the riverside eateries, the air is fresh and dry.... some days it's hot & humid :)I didn't do the ordering this time but the American menu and sauces agrees with me!a good place to unwind, have a few drinks and chill out
5
I have made this place my go-to specially when having good company to enjoy a cosy atmosphere and good food. Service was a bit slow though - assuming cos it was a Friday night but the food did not let me down, as always. The waiters were also attentive towards our requests. Good to go and always always make prior reservations!
5
With a great view, good ambiance, a happy crowd, superb service and awesome burgers, need I say more? My friend brought me here for a relaxed night and ever since, I've been back almost every friday! You must try the Truffle Burger and the Truffle Fries. The nachos and brussel sprouts is a must try too! Tip: get drinks at Happy Hour
5
The service crew, Rueben, made a recommendation to order the spicy buffalo wing and it was an awesome recommendation!! They had 3 different level to choose from and the Hot Stuff has just the right amount of spiciness in it. Definitely coming back to try the other levels! Thanks Reuben and Overeasy.
5
Thank you for the memorable experience in overeasy fullerton .. specially to ate gelyn for the excellent service and luke for the special cocktail that he made to us .. We will come back againAnd before i forget thank you also to jessica for assisting us to choice the better place to sit ..
5
We went here for dinner/drinks as it was just along from the Merlion and has a superb aspect facing MBS. The service and food were both really nice, clearly a popular spot for post work drinks and was decent value too. Definitely recommended although just note it might be busy later in the evening if you haven't reserved
3
My friend and I visited this place on a Friday evening in April 2017. The setting is absolutely gorgeous with Marina Bay, MBS, Singapore skyline and the flyer in the background. As the evening sun sets and the lights come on, the place is magically transformed into a glittering, dancing heaven of lights reflecting off the waters.The bar has 3 kinds of seating - high stool, relaxed couch and indoors. The service is slow and indifferent. Especially, one waitress who wore the name tag of "Eli" looked totally lost and spaced out. The starters were delicious. The drinks, especially the wines, tasted stale and and foul. I think it could be because the management is trying to get rid of old, stale wines during the happy hour. In any case, the cocktails too were very ordinary. The worst part of the evening was music. They have a third rate music system thanks to which you have to strain your ears to hear every note being played. The DJ was awful and played some trashy numbers. Music, instead of livening up the place, dampened our moods. Overall verdict, go for the views and the starters but don't stay for the drink and the music and try not to curse the waiters
5
Love the truffle burger and linguine. Dessert was fantastic. A place worth to go back again to enjoy great foods, great view and great service.
5
Went a date with my wonderful girlfriend, was recommended Truffle burger and linguine, one of the best burger i ever had, juicy patty with tuffle fries.
Great food plus fantastic service on top of the wonderfil view of MBS.
5
Went out woth colleagues from overseas, nice place with nice view
Awesome service from Gelyn and Ellie. Both were very accomodating ;)
Went here for my bday last year and went back again.
5
Gelyn and erika(elli) were wonderrful hosts! The food was awesome, the ambience was superb, it was fantabluous...
Super califragilistic expialidocius!
5
The location is amazing with great view of Marina Bay Sands hotel. The food is delicious. Try any type of burger and the mac n cheese is to die for!!!
5
Great location, amazing view! Extremely polite, helpful and friendly stuff. Food was delicious, try the mac and cheese, and any kind of burger! Sunset time is the best time to dine there!
5
I had planned a surprise for my Wife, with the help of the Overeasy team (Allan, Kadir, Hui Yee, Syahrul, etc) all kitchen, bar, service staff were extremely helpful. They help execute everything perfectly and wonderfully. My Wife was truly surprised and we had a great time over delicious food and drinks. Everyone was happy and it's a memorable evening. BigThank you to all Overeasy staffs for the wonderful evening
5
Always pop into this place for happy hour when in Singapore but my last visit was exceptional. Had a long conversation with the manager as it wasn't busy and was surprised when the bill arrived that he had given us a considerable discount and upon thanking him he presented me with a souvenir bourbon glass...great stuff.The beer is always cold, the staff friendly and of course the views across marina bay awesome.I'll be bac
3
Good diner, but with lots of tables outside why couldn’t we sit there. They have a fixed menu, but have a lot of “ad ons” that we I think should be included
3
This is an excellent spot to bring first time visitors to Singapore, with great views across Marina Bay. The food is American dinner style, which is ok if that is what you are ready for. I booked for 10 people, they prepared the table for 8, so took some organising but they got It done, but not quickly. Gelyn took over looking after us and she got things under control quickly. Good drinks list here
5
Nice place to have a drink with friends on weekend night. Especially with the scenery of Marina Bay Sands. Always bring friends there when they are visiting Singapore.
5
Very friendly staff, delicious food and drinks, good price for the location and the view. I will come here again. The playlist rocks as well
5
Their staff, especially Gelyn was very attentive to our needs and was such a good host. The playlist is super awesome. All in all, it was such a great experience
5
This is an amazing place, the moment they learned it was my birthday they gave me a birthday cake, invited me to make my own cocktail and offered 4 shots on the house. Best place in Singapore with the best music and view. Highly recommend it!

Poor service. Put in a request for a quieter table as we have kids. Staff was insistent that they did not receive the special request. When we identified an empty table, staff insisted that the table was specifically reserved by another customer. Bad Lie. Asked waitress for kids menu and was appalled to hear that the restaurant does not have kids menu. Knowing that there is since we've been there before, we requested from another waitress who eventually brought us the menu. If you are not sure, you should at least check.

Good place for a relaxing lunch on a work day. Set meals are good value as portions are generous Had the Santa Fe Chicken Soup. Was really good with fresh ingredients. And the pasta with prawns. Portions was huge. Good service & I would recommend. Do make reservations.
4
Super good place to chill out with friends. Nice views and atmosphere. Food selection is limited but happy hour is good
5
A great place for dinner and chill. Was seated in doors and then seeing its good weather out we requested to change to outdoors. Staff were accomodating and prompt. Great view with great weather. Maybe the food is abit pricy but the view and chill atmosphere makes up for it. HappyHour 1 for 1 was great too!
4
Went down to Merlion Park to the viewpoint and decided to get some food with my girlfriend, wanted something not too pricey and OverEasy was perfect, considering the sushi restaurant next door was extremely overpriced! Not too expensive and the food was excellent, staff were friendly and the service was quick, would definitely recommend it if you are in the area and want to eat with a great view of Marina Sands.

We came here for a relaxed dinner at the promenade. When we arrived we waited for someone to offer us a seat, but after none of the waiters noticed us (probably because they were looking at their mobile phones all the time) we just went to a table for two. A waitress brought us the menu and looked at us like we should be incredibly grateful for that service. We ordered and at the same moment the waitress asked us for our credit cards (we ordered two burgers). We asked her why and she told us that this is the normal procedure here - well, okay. But then we noticed that none of the other guests had to pay before eating. We are two young girls and we don't look anyhow suspicious or like thieves but in that moment we felt like criminals. As already mentioned the waiters look at their mobile phones all the time and look very disinterested. The food is expensive but good and the view is nice. But since that doesn't cope the really bad service we definitely won't visit Overeasy again

Friday night meal with friends. Very impressed with sms alert when a table was available so you didn't have to wait around.
Great food and drink with a wonderful view of the bay and light show. Staff very friendly and efficient
1
Extremely terrible experience. Found glass in burger patty and plastic beads in spaghetti. Staff and senior sous Chef couldn't explain the cause and did not follow up when the incident was reported.
4
Food was nice. Environment nice as well. The interior design very cool indeed and quite comfortable.
4
Stopped for lunch here on the way to Australia nice American fast food restaurants good for snacks and for a few Singapore slings as well.
5
This was an absolutely amazing experience I thoroughly enjoyed myself. The service we received from Alex was out of this world he is an very intelligent young man who will definitely go far. The drinks and food were good but over and above that it was the type of service we received. Overeasy Marina Bay you have great people take care of them..
4
Shout out to Jessica, she was really attentive and friendly which certainly helped the overall experience! The planning for the birthday celebration was not smooth sailing though. It was difficult to reach them through the phone and the email response was very slow. I started planning 4 days and only managed to confirm the birthday special just a few hours before. But at the end of the day, the food there was great, the atmosphere was lovely, our server was awesome and the birthday surprise was a success
4
If you are looking for a place that is more reasonably priced in Merlion Park, I would recommend this restaurant. It has a '50s vibe. The chicken, bacon, lettuce, avocado, tomato sandwich was well prepared, tasty, and juicy. It comes with fries which were also yummy. Service was fast and efficient.If we are in this area again, certainly would consider eating here again
3
Ordered the "to die for burgers" but it doesn't really live up to its name. It came with french fries that seems to have been fried twice or over an overused oil. The view of course was the best part of it as it was overlooking the bay.. without it it would have been a poor rating for me
5
We had a reservation, so they had written our name on the table and reserved one of the best spots for us. The staff was friendly and the food was too good. My first visit was at Overeasy Orchard, and because our experience last time was amazing, we wanted to come again, this time to try the one at Fullerton. The view was breath-taking too! Singapore fails to disappoint me
5
Great atmosphere, service, especially by the waitress named SHINE!! she gave good recommendations and is very bubbly towards the customers to
5
We went in this place as was busy and is normally a good sign, beers were spot on and food was great, although not massive portions were very tasty.
5
OverEasy really impressed me with the overeasy crew's great service! Made a call prior to visit to make an arrangement for a birthday surprise and one of the staff, Shine, was really helpful and enthusiastic about it. Ground staff were all attentive and efficient. Basically service was good even before we came to the restaurant (phone call), all the way till we left the restaurant! Thank you Shine and team for making my bf's birthday memorable for us!! Will definitely come by for the great food and drinks again
5
Went to OverEasy to celebrate a friend's birthday on 17 Feb. The service was excellent & it has stepped up tremendously since my last visit ~ 3 months ago. I was served by Alex & another waiter(can't quite remember his name but it started with R). Great job gents!Will definitely look forward to heading back here more frequently. Keep up the good work!Navi
4
Went with a gf and we ordered 4 sides (tortilla chips w dips, buffalo wings, ol'fashion mac& cheese and sweet potato fries). Food portion were quite big and tasted good especially the wings. Would recommend sitting outdoors to enjoy our beautiful Singapore skyline although I would recommend that they installed some outdoor fans. One thing that could be improved was definitely service, there were plenty of staff but service was so slow. I asked 1 staff for the menu and she actually told me she had to ask someone experience to attend to me! How difficult was it to get a menu? We also had to ask for the bill 3 times from 2 diff staff before it eventually came (aft 15mins).
4
We have been to Overeasy before at Orchard and now decided to try this at One Fullerton. The view was amaazzziiiinngg - Marina Bay Sands, Flyer, though we had to move indoors due to rain.Alfresco seating is the highlight with not so loud and pleasant music. High tables with bar stools in the smoking area are somewhat easily available as compared to tables with chairs with a better view.I chose the only mocktail that seemed bit interesting on the menu - Tropic thunder while others had alcoholic drinks. It was good but it would be great if they can introduce a few more for mocktail lovers like me.Food was good - in taste and in presentation. Lil backer platter was simply superb.They made our Valentines eve all the more special with instax mini pics and balloons and smiles. Totally recommend as a place to bring friends visiting Singapore or otherwise
3
This is one of my favourite hunt, be if with my loved one or friends. Food was surprisingly salty on this particular visit, unlike the usual though the taste was still generally good.
4
Had a great night there! Good value for money as the atmosphere is superb, especially if you sit in the open area. Food is good, although nothing extraordinary.
3
The food wasn't really as good as i expected it to be. The dessert was too much sugar and cinnamon to
5
been seeing this joint for many years and finally got a chance to try on V-Day yesterday.Service is impeccable and personal. Simply love the fun crew and the whole outdoor setup. Food is great and don't missed out on the chilli fries! Waffles was recommended but having it's off day on m
4
No separate q for reservations, got a high table with a comfy seat with cushion. However, I kept sliding down the chair while dining.... waiters were friendly and responsive when you ask for them. Food wise, I had prawn linguine in lemon butter sauce, it was good. My bf had B.L.A.T burger, it was meh.. the burger was dry, not to his liking.
5
It's always a good time at OverEasy. The view, the breeze, and the music makes the ambiance great! It gets crowded at times so it will be wiser to make reservations! So far I am just lucky that I have yet encounter the need of waiting for tables. Want to have a great night? Visit OverEasy. Too easy
3
Requested and confirmed for outside sitting during reservation but when we were there, we will given indoor table. When questioned, they said it was not guaranteed even if confirmed. This is not right and what is the point for asking?
5
To celebrate last Friday evening my colleagues joined me at OverEasy Fullerton. I always love going there - it has one of the best views in Singapore whilst having a drink; it's good value especially at happy hour and the staff are awesome! Special shout out to Jiahui who looked after us so nicely as always! She even arranged a celebration ice cream for me as a surprise! I highly recommend OverEasy to visitors to singapore and those living here who love atmosphere, great views and great people!!
4
Arrived at 7.30 & the place was mobbed.Asked for a table for 2 & the staff were very helpful although it was obvious the there were few tables available.....we were seated inside but promised an outside table once one became available.Drinks service was very quick & we were made aware that there was a 2 for one offer until 8pm & we gladly availed ourselves of the offer.Food was pretty straitforward fare which we enjoyed.A table outside had been found for us & we finished our drinks in the great atmosphere....everyone was very much enjoying themselves & I think that this is Overeasy's biggest asset
5
The linguine with prawns is a MUST TRY!!!! The staffs there are very friendly too!!! Special thanks to Zafhri and Elly for making sure our orders came quickly, Reuben and Tiffany for making sure our table was clean and tidy!! Thanks for the excellent service :-) my date and I enjoyed our time there. Will definitely visit again!
5
Great place to eat, drink and watch the lights show at Marina Bay Sands which happens every day at 8pm and 9:20 pm
5
The service (and the HOT wingz, Crazy Mofo) was awesome thanks to ONE person, Alex the amazing waitor! We will definitely return to this place on our next visit to beautiful Singapore
4
A cosy pub with a selection of food choicesa and drinks. You can hang out with friends and families, and it has a good view of Marina Bay from the promenade. Music is a bit loud (it is a pub in the first place!), and the food are ok (pub grade). For the atmosphere and the location, it makes for good food and drinks (a bit expensive, but this is the city fringe facing the marina!).Note: Arrive early, as it tends to get crowded very quickly, and clubbers usually stay long to chat. Comfy open seats and large area. When ordering, you really need a flashlight to see the menu (it's rather dark in the evening). All in all, a great place to hang out and catch up with friends. Near to Raffles MRT station. You can easily walk to Merlion Park and then onto Esplanade from here
4
The rain made up a little upset - not enjoying the couch seating. Overall Qayyum and a manager who popped the bottle of Moscato really taking good care of u
5
Love the whole chilled, relaxed vibe of this place. The door host , pretty Vivian was super duper friendly and helpful. Keep it up girl! That started us right, we had our pre-dinner drinks there. Another employee, trainee Gillian ( hope i got her name right) was a ray of sunshine too. As you can see, my review is more abt the service than the food cos we didn't have our meals there. Overall a truly wonderful experience, the view is to-die-for !
5
We had a fantastic time at Overeasy, and the service was excellent and we had a very pleasant surprise from an attentive server. Keep up the good work
4
Over Easy is Restaurant/Bar overlooking Harbour and across to Bayside where Boat Resort is on top of Towers. Happy Hour (with 2 for 1) finishes at 8pm and the Harbour Light/Laser Show starts at 8pm. We arrived before 8 and sat outside. Food quite American in style (eg burgers) Not Cheap but moderate (all day breakfast $22) and pint of Erdinger $17 but remember 2 for 1. When light show started ideally placed to watch in comfort and then chill out. Good for quick snack/meal but not for romantic dinner as right in heart of tourist are
4
This was my first visit, we had a dinner with a couple friends on a thursday evening. The staff were helpful and friendly, the staff we interacted with are definitely a cut above the norm for SG. The food was good and not overly expensive for the area and the crowd they cater too.I would recommend this place and will be back again
3
Good venue for food and drinks, even though the prices are on the high side. Only recommend this place if there's Happy Hour promotion. For the amount of money paid, there are better options elsewhere.
3
Decent nachos with egg and fries, pasta was quite average though. Happy hour was a good deal. If you like milkshakes, try the M&A one, the texture is quite interestin
4
Always preferred this outlet (Fullerton Bay) over the Orchard one. Great view, good service, awesome crew
5
Fast and efficient lunch menu. Good service and good value. I had a hamburger and it is classic. Can't go wrong
5
I am glad that they finally open on Sundays too!Booked my a table for 5 on a Sunday evening for dinner and drinks. NO regrets! Young, dynamic and fun bunch of servers with a simple yet delicious menu to choose from. Despite the price being a tad bit high, it didn't affect the overall experience.Perfect hangout with friends in the evening as it overlooks the amazing Marina Bay Sands Hotel. Catch the best view of the laser show every evening here at the outdoor seating
4
Though the portion of food has reduced since the last time I visited, they still tasted good. Atmosphere was fantastic as usual. Service has improved to be quicker.
5
Was there for an event and countdown on NYE. Great ambience with nice view and dj spinning hits through the night . Crowd was spontaneous and friendly too. Special mention to staff Nicholas who help to arrange the event and reservation! Happy 2017 to all!
5
Was there on Xmas eve, though din experienced much xmas mood there but food was delicious and good customer service
3
There is no denying that OverEasy's happy hour is one of the better offers in the area. However, the food is average at best and even at a dollar per slider you're not sure they're worth that. The chicken wings are actually pretty decent but the accompanying vegetables seem old. If you can get a seat outside you'll have a cracker of a view.... But you may well spend your time very frustrated by the rubbish service. The staff are generally attentive, but they rarely seem to get an order correct or bring everything in a timely manner.
5
Reservation was easily done on Chope on my mobile phone. Food was great as expected since it is not my first visit. A pity was that the sliders were not going for $1 each!
5
My friends planning a proposal during NYE we settled at OverEasy (Fullerton) one of the reason is we will be so close with the fireworks! Very thankful for the staff (Nicholas) helping us throughout! The food is amazing, the floor staffs so friendly and helpful, everything went on so smoothly! I will definitely go back there for countdown!! Whoooop!
4
Linguine was so nice. Great food with nice view. I can see the lighting show just happen in front of me. Is a good plac
5
Fantastic spot to have beer and burgers. Great views of Marina Bay Sands and it's a really good spot to chill out and enjoy the daily light show. The food was really good (definitely try the burgers) and the staff were helpful and attentive
3
Food was alright, would not expect to pay those prices for it though. The service charge was a lot too, not really sure why though as the service wasn't that good
4
OverEasy is a very good place to meet friends after work and see Singapore's life night. Price,food and service very reasonable.
5
Certainly the best burgers I have had for a long time and in a great location. Needless to say it is very expensive but you don't expect it to be in this locatio
3
was there for Christmas dinner, ordered medium rare but came out as well done beef. On the bright side the service crew were attentive.
4
Booked an outdoors seat but it was unfortunately raining and the waitress promptly gave us an indoor seat :) service was great and the waitresses were all really friendly and attentive! Food was good too, overall a good experience
5
We arrived a little early for the lazer/light show so parked ourselves outside Overeasy.Diana served us and was polite quick and helpful.When we asked about the light show she was very economical with the true timings as the show times came and went it was just to keep us there as customers. When she did tell us the correct times it was too late to go somewhere else so we waited the 30minutes for the next show.The service was prompt ,polite, funny and the drinks were cold the view is excellent across the bay to the Marina Bay hotel and we had fee snacks all evening.To make sure we were only paying for what we drank I paid the tab off every three drinks so both sides could remember what we had ordered.We were in Singapore for two days but if you are passing for a longer period try the food, we didn't as we had already eaten on our visit
5
Their Happy Hour are reasonable and with the nice cosy ambience , many office staff will go there for a drinks. Therefore, you can meet alot of ppl and is a great hangout place. And lastly, their burger is a must try. Super juicy and stuffy. Worth the paid.
4
Delicious Burgers. The buffalo wings are fantastic - although little hot for a couple of people in our party. The service could be better - ordering bespoke burgers was a real effort
5
It was my first time here. Came with my colleagues and we had a totally chillax time. Buffalo wings are a MUST try. Go easy on the spiciness level. Level 2 was already pretty intense, and you can ask for the sauce on the side if you're not confident.
5
Great little restaurant on marina bay, reasonable priced food for Singapore. Terrific spot to watch the laser show at 8 o'clock. Staff friendly as is typical of most of Singapore. Good choice for a casual dinner.
3
Friday night, few beers and catch up with the ladies. Cool vibe, ok prices, fab view of the bay. Restaurant was full so reservation is essential.
4
Beer is not bad. Snacks are fine. View is great. Outdoor seats are pretty good. The ambience is the selling point.
4
The food was good and definitely will visit overeasy again for the view and food. The staff was friendly as well.
4
The place is cozy and have a wonderful view. Highly recommended for chill out of hang out with friends. The service is good and very responsive. However, if one thing to improve, you may add more fan at the outdoor area. It would be good. Thank you 
4
great atmosphere, nice food, fries is a little bit dry, lettuce/avocado is nice! need to book in advance because it's usually packed with people. Great time to have dinner at around 7:30 when u can see the light show across the river!
3
The waitress hold the credit card for long period once you order the food. This is 1st restaurant i saw that waiter hold customer credit card until end of the dinner. Suggest other customer pay by cash for security
4
The staff here are very friendly and serving western food .. Btw I went for alcohol, I had a beer and 3 cocktails here.. The Singapore sling here is good..
4
We went for after work drinks at half past six. The weather was perfect and the skies were beautiful allowing us to appreciate Sg's skyline and wind down after a hectic work day. Happy hour drink prices were attractive. The only downside is that the restaurant should consider offering more bar food on the menu!
4
great place for a weekend drink, beers are good and the milkshakes too (have a malt shake for sure!). Food is good too and I would highly recommend dropping in before heading over the marina bay as the sun set
4
was supposed to get the outdoor table but due to rain, we were given the indoor instead. even when we were indoor, the awesomeness is still there. great place for chilling with group of friends. the Mac and Cheese(truffles) is a must try when you are there! the service could have been better, but i guess they were really busy there
4
What a great location! Want a top spot with perfect views of the harbour, then head to Overeasy. Tip: Book well ahead for a table outside so you get a seat, otherwise you may end up inside which does not afford a good view of the laser display at 8 and 9pm. Well worth being outside as it has an excellent waterfront atmosphere. Best to choose lots of dishes and share them if you have a large group so you get to try everything. Happy hour ends at 8pm so get in before then for buy one get two or 'one for one' as they call it. They get busy almost every night so remember book ahead for a good table and the best views. Good US style with a modern twist and more than up to a casual meal. Service was ok although they are busy and you need to wave your hand to get their attention. Have fun, enjoy
2
Stopped by here for a late evening drink en-route to our hotel. Not a great experience in comparison to all other Singapore venues we visited. Drinks and service were very average and pricey. Most surprisingly however the toilets were not clean and were in need of attention. Wouldn't return.
5
Excellent attention to detail by Zhafri! Service standards of this level is hard to come by. Keep up the great work
5
I chose Overeasy at One Fullerton for my little farewell gathering with friends as I will be away from Singapore for a while. This place is located in convenient CBD area as well as they got amazing MBS view. At that night, I was very impressed by the service of the staff, especially Zhafri. He was friendly and always being around to our group to make sure all good. When my friends mentioned to him that this is my farewell gathering, Zhafri brought me special dessert with my name, shot and a balloon. It made my night special and wonderful. Thank you Zhafri for your great service
1
My family and I sat for 10 mins and were completely ignored so we left.
The booth seats were all ripped with tape to repair and it looked shabby - probably a good thing they couldn't be bothered with us.
Avoid this place.
4
It is a good place to hang out, beautiful view. Food is average, beer can chicken is too salty. Service is good, I will be back again.
3
My group of 9 were seated outside. The view was wonderful and there were laser shows and colourful bicycle parade, these plus the "fireworks" birthday cake for my friend who is celebrating her birthday there made that a beautiful evening for all of us.
5
Staffs were very friendly. They were also very frank when we asked for opinions on certain dishes/drinks. Accompanied by a great atmosphere and amazing view of Singapore's skyline, our overall dining experience was superb
5
The burgers here were absolutely brilliant and the view was pretty hard to beat! The staff were really nice and even though they were clearly busy, were still attentive.
4
Having eaten at the Orchard Branch my husband kept saying about this one as a great place to watch the Marina Bay light show. It was relatively busy for 7pm but the staff managed to get us a table outside. The menu is the same as the Orchard branch. We chose sliders to start - they were on special for "Happy hour" - $1 per slider - not being greedy we opted for 2 each per adult but tbh I could have eaten all six myself - they are delicious!! Kids had meatballs & spaghetti and chicken poppers with mash potato. Both went down a treat. The adults chose the Grilled Chicken BLAT, Pastrami sandwich with a side of sweet potato fries and the rib-eye steak. All were well-received - the pastrami sandwich has to be one of the best I have ever tasted. The menu stated it comes with sauerkraut so was expecting the traditional stuff but it was with coleslaw which was fine as it was very tasty. No deserts this time as we were all pleasantly full.By siting outside you can see the light-show and the overall ambiance of the bay side setting is very pleasant. Overall - definitely one for a return visit!! (A bonus is there is an on-site restroom, not something that is common in Singapore restaurants!!
4
Most of the waiters & waitresses were friendly and accomodating. They engaged well with the customers. They even recommended few cocktails based on what you like without you asking. Great initiative. Compliment to this one particular chinese waitress whom i had a chat with, couldn't remember her name :(The food were adequately good. Could be bette
5
We were drawn to this place as we walked along the marine bay due to the 6-8pm happy hour on draft beer, wine and house spirits. They had a good selection of drinks and we got 2 Erdingers for SD17, about Â£8. The menu is American themed and we were tempted by the burger section, I got a 'to die for' burger and fries and my partner got the double burger. The food was delicious, extremely succulent meat and a shaving of cheese on the fries made it an extremely tasty meal. Our server, Jon, was very attentive and recommended how well done the burgers should be.We also received a complimentary dessert at the end of our meal - well timed for the water display across the bay that we could watch. We had some issues with our card upon payment but the staff were very patient and pointed us to the nearest ATM. A nice, lively restaurant for a relaxed meal on the waterfront!
5
After a long trip to Singapore we decided to spend the end of the evening at Overeasy and we were surprised with the best hamburguer of my life and with a very kind support from the waiter. We had a great night and for sure we will be back. Besides the food and attentive support the view of the marina is amazing
3
I been to the outlets at Orchard (Liat Towers) and One Fullerton recently and I must say both are pretty good places to chill and catch up with friends and/or family. Ambiance wise, the One Fullerton outlet has the slight edge since it is right beside the bay across from Marina Bay Sands (MBS) and along the stretch as Merlion.Service wise, Orchard's outlet wins. The staff in Orchard were friendly, observant and attentive. The One Fullerton branch was almost as good though there was a slight unpleasant experience - we made reservations for outdoor seating and unfortunately it was raining (though lightly)... however the "host" sat us outside despite the rest of the staff clearly moving everyone else who were seated outside, indoors. Even the server who was handling the outdoors section was surprised by the "host's" decision. Thankfully, service for the remainder of the night was good so perhaps it was just a problem with the host. Worth a visit
4
Arrived closed to 30 mins late due to traffic but had table whipped up for me in no time. Food was nice and the view is amazing. Tends to be really busy at times but all in all a good experience
4
everything was perfect except the speed of food delivery. We had to chase for every part of the set course. Service is great and I ordered the "to die for" signature burger from the set lunch menu. Great value. Their Chocolate lava cake is a must-try
4
My friends took me there for lunch to celebrate my birthday and the restaurant prepared a very special dessert with a sparkling candle light-up. It was the most unique birthday celebration that I had ever received from any restaurant. A wonderful surprise and the dessert was an interesting creation of ice cream with chocolate waffles and pop corns! Simply delicious
3
The bar has a great view of the Bay and has a fairly good Happy Hour deal on during the weekday afternoon/early evening. The problem with this place was the fact that my partner and I were asked to move from 2 different tables during the evening. We were happy to move the first time to accommodate a larger table but only 20mins later we were asked to move from the table we had been asked to sit on by the manager as this table was now booked! I found this a bit much considering we had already been moved once. The waiter who was serving us was lovely and did offer us some complimentary nibbles for our trouble but I just think some more organisation would be good here. Having said that it was a very busy place but perhaps this is down to the location rather than the way the bar is run
4
I made a reservation at 7.30 and we were promptly showed to our table. Service rendered was great and we really loved the 1-for-1 happy hour promotion. However, there is room for improvement for the food. Taste was so-so and it's quite expensive too. Other than that, it was a pleasant experience and the night view was wonderful.
3
Food was pretty good! Beer was on happy hr, 2 pints fr 17. Tho portion can be bigger. Great locatio
5
First time coming here and it was definitely a pleasant first experience. Staffs were attentive, great ambience and great music. Special mention goes to Emily who was super friendly and a joy to talk to, would definitely come here again soon!
5
Love this place for their burgers, fries, and the view. It's a spot I keep coming back to, especially when friends and family are visiting so that we can show off the great view of Marina Bay.
5
Perfect View when drinking and a very cozy place. Add to that, they have the nicest staff. I have frequented Overeasy during their Happy hour with colleagues or mates and everything is just perfect. It's always nice to have a venue where you have an option to drink in a smoking area, non smoking area or an inside seating. Off-course, it is always nicer to be outside where you have a view of the bay and the MBS. They most of the time also have a nice set of playlists. If you have the time, come over and visit Overeasy, they have happy hour 1-1 til 9pm. Their food is amazing, i always fancy the mini burgers or the meatball pasta... :
5
Always great to be back, had lunch here right now. Food is awesome and service is friendly and warm! Loves coming back! My all time favourite- Reuben pastrami sandwich and breakfast nachos! Excellent lunch menu als
4
Good service, great place to enjoy scenary. The only bad thing is that maybe they should have a few big standing fans at the outdoor area
4
had few rounds of drinks with my colleagues and clients last week. great view of the CBD area, nice sea breeze, service was great. 1 for 1 drinks makes everything awesome. ordered a platter and the food are great as well. Will be there next time agai
5
Nice place to hang out with friends. Food is awesome n worth the price. Staff is friendly too. Love the chill back atmosphere. If u sit outdoor, u will njoy the view too. :
5
An awesome experience at Overeasy. The service crew Rudi, Reuben, Yu Sung, Zhafri and Wilfred really amazed us with the service quality that they had set up despite being part timers. They gave exceptional service and were very professional when it came to taking the order and the overall service outcome. Especially when it's was my girlfriend birthday, they surprised us with a birthday cake and balloon which really made our day as it was really the thought that counts.We really enjoyed ourself thoroughly throughout the night. And you will surely expect us to be back for another great service
4
My friends and I went for a dinner a few weeks ago and enjoyed great food and drinks over there. I happened to hint to the staff that it was my friend's birthday and they surprised my friends with a complimentary drink and a "show". Really impressed by the service shown, keep it up! Would definitely be back again for another wonderful experience
5
My friends and I went to Overeasy as I was recommed by my sister who said that the pasta and wagyu burger was to die for. I did order the pasta and it was as what she said it was...Awesome!!!..We also ordered the fiery wings, truffle mac and cheese,banana cake and the molten lava cake. It was all sensational. An explosion of the senses. Our server by the name of Zhafri rendered out excelled table service. Our food came out on time and the rest of the other servers were just as attentive. Overall an excellent experience. Would came back again to try their signature burger
5
I like the ambience of this place and the crowd as well. The view of Marina Bay Sands doesn't hurt as well. It's a great place to just chill and enjoy a couple of cocktails. I love their mojitos
4
We went there with a group of 15 people for a surprise birthday party. The view is excellent, staff was friendly, and the food is good. Recommended for large groups
4
The view is nice, the staff was helpful and accommodating despite a large number of guests (10+). They kept our birthday cake in the fridge and provided plates at the end. They also extend the happy hour to 10pm just for us.Foodwise, the truffle burger was not bad but what I really liked was the pastrami sandwich. So difficult to find good ones in Singapore. Fries were ok and overall we had a pleasant evening. Not the best best value burger in town though, neither the tastiest. But still worth it
5
Amazing burgers especially the Truffle Burger and fantastic view of Marina Bay Sands! Always a pleasure dining at OverEasy. Thank you for the great food and hospitality
5
Nice view facing MBS, good service & atmosphere for after work chillax. $1 mini chicken or beef burger & mojito happy hour before 7pm.
5
Came over for farewell drinks with colleagues as our office is nearby.. Happy hour promotion for 1-1 drinks.great food

Had their "To Die For" burger and it's definitely not so. Taste was below average and just like a thicker version of McDonald's cheeseburger. Burger was dry with no sauce & it does not have any unique taste/ingredient that "wow" us. Their fries was better than their burger.However, their molten lava chocolate cake was good.Atmosphere was so-so. Aircon was leaking & i think some of the drips got into the food before serving to customers. Server seems unaware / aloof about it?Service was okay? Overall staff-energy was low & looks like they are unhappy to serve people / working there.Won't be back anytime soon i guess

You have a stunning view from there over the Marina and before a certain time you have deals on Miniburger for SGD 1 each. And tartuffo fries, very nice

Been going to OverEasy @ One Fullerton for about 2 years now. It's a good fun place, with a decent weekday happy hour on beers. Great view of Marina Bay Sands if you sit outside. The place isn't too expensive for the great views. One downside is that the service can get overly slow once they get a tad bit busy. The other negative about the place is inflexibility - their policy is that the 1-for-1 happy hour beers need to be served together (they will refuse to hold one back for you while you finish the 1st one). A bit of an annoying rule, as it gets awkward sitting with 2 beers out in the heat if you happen to be the only beer drinker in your group. You can ask for a ice bucket but the problem is the glass is really tall and half your beer will stick out in the heat. For this very reason I avoid this place if there is an alternative
3
Food was decent but not as fantastic as what you read in many reviews especially when you consider the price point. In what is a rarity for Singapore, the service was actually better than the food.
4
Food was alright. I would appreciate if truffle burger is included in the set lunch menu. Won't mind to top up to have the truffle burger than the to-die-for burger.
5
This place has an awesome collection of drinks and some decent but tasty collection of food as well. The USP of this place is its location - it offers excellent uninhibited views of the Marina Bay and the Marina Bay Sands hotel. The staff is attentive and warm. It gets extremely crowded and noisy on weekends but on weekdays, its the perfect place to hangout for dinner and drinks with friends. The finger food is good as well and the cocktails are exceptionally good
5
Returned to this fun but casual restaurant after first visiting when last travelling through Singapore a year ago. The food is consistent, and the staff are very productive, even when the place is packed out and they are under pressure
3
Service crew didn't well training! Already place order, but 20mins later food and drink didn't serve, ask the service staff then realise they didn't key in our order....what kind of this service..
5
The view of the bay made it an incredible experience, and the menu was a bit pricey but worth it for the flavour and atmosphere!
5
Me and my friends went to there to have some drinks. One of the staff name is Zhafria is excellent service and professional!!!! He recommended us a nice drink and also offered us a drink game tool which was very fun! Moreover, he knew that I am having my birthday on the date, so he passed me a balloon and all the staff came out from the restaurant, holding a cake that there is a word: Happy Birthday to Bella together with the birthday song! I was sososo touched by them!!! I love the service, and definitely I will be come back!
5
Really had a great time with my buddy here. Dun miss out on their happy hour promotion on one for one beer which runs till 10 pm on a sat night! Caution - The buffalo wings are rather spicy. So check with the staff on how u like them. The scenery and atmosphere must be experienced. The staff are friendly and nice. Was served by Emily who made us feel very comfy. Would love to come back.
5
The view and the food is awesome. The skyline of Marina Bay Sands is simply a place not to be missed. Not to mention the excellent service by the staff at Overeasy especially Emily.
5
Great ambience, cool staff, really nice place to chill! Emily was so really friendly, had a nice, had an extremely good time here
4
Near to CBA (Central Business Area). Magnificent view. Have famous draft beer and delicious food. Values for what you give. In contrast with others bars, staff are friendly af :P. Find it out by yourself the rest. *wink*Enjoy yr quality time with ur buds.Cheers
4
I like the place but it's a little on the expensive side, but everywhere else along that stretch is around the same price point.
5
Came over on a weekend, despite being crowded and it started raining halfway, our waitress Emily was attentive towards us. After being relocated, she made sure we were comfortable with where we were. Excellent service.We will definately be back again.
5
Great food, Great view of Singapore river and Great service. Service by Emily was awesome and sweet!! Love her service :) Will be back again!!
5
I haven't been to OverEasy at Fullerton for several years due to being overseas. I have always just thought it to be a place with a good view. However an impromptu decision to head to OverEasy last week has changed my mind. The best thing about this establishment is not the view, but the people who work there. Zahfri, in particular, was a stand out. From making sure my party was comfortable with the temperature, to going the extra mile to try and make sure food was prepared to our liking and having balloon & a birthday brownie sent for my friend's birthday! Thank you Zahfri, for making one of my nights out in Singapore during my month long trip awesome
4
Nice view and staff remembers what you ordered, making the next order easier. Food was too pricey though.
4
It's a perfect view of Marina Bay. You can take the best pictures if it's not a cloudy day. If possible, try the stay in the outdoor area, it's to see and be seen :) Try the mojito and small bites. Delicious!
5
Nice food, cold beers, pleasant outdoor deck by the Bay, cool music, good service. Bring a friend or two. They will love it.
5
Was there to celebrate our friend's hen's night and upon request to change to a seat with a better view, the staff promptly see to the arrangement. The night was followed by great customer service and all staffs are very helpful and friendly! We were surprised with a complimentary drink for the special occasion. Food was awesome as well! Will definitely be coming back
3
The ambience of our tall building and MBS is our proud and pride, its definately a beautiful place to stare at either in day or night... But I kind of disappointed with the restaurant when I got a half mug full coke float which I pay for $10. First time I had one like this... usually I have a full mug of it where ice cream nearly over flow... We decide to move out after our dinner, but our request was made when we reach the restaurant. The staff is very friendly and helpful to reserve us a place.. At the outdoor seat... the sofa area are so uncomfortable... not only of the humid weather Singapore have, but the table between each table are so close to each other that I can basically listen to what my neighbor is talking about. The restaurant has a UOB credit card promotion, but we were not told about it when we are ask whether do we want to keep a tab. We only knew it when we over heard another staff telling another customer, and when we enquiry about this, they told us... "sorry... we cannot change the charge card" Its not a very pleasant experience with this place althought the ambience is nice....
4
A great plus of this place is the marvellous, enchanting view to the Marina Bay Sands hotel and the Marina Bay. A few meters away from the Merlion, and with very good music. Food is good but maybe a little bit more expensive than expected. Has happy hour for drinks (1 to 1)
4
After walking around town, we came across OverEasy! Happy Hour Beer 2 for 1 (S$16) was perfect ! Nicely chilled draft beer with views of Marina Bay Sands, Performing Arts and Singapore Flyer on the skyline was perfect! Ambience was great, outdoor and with sundown, not as hot or humid. A great place to relax and chill-out at sundown. Did not eat so can't comment on the food but they had a great selections as seen on the menu
4
Amazing place to enjoy some beers with some good salads and choice of food...from Thierry international menu... it's at a very touristic spot as it is 20 steps from the Merlion and placed right opposite the Land mark hotel...Marina Bay Sands. You can sit for hours and enjoy the outdoors from here....as the sun goes beyond a few building to give a nice shade over this spot..
3
Ambience is pretty awesome in the evening to chill out with friends. Service was prompt and friendly
5
These are my mates. They are the best. They give me a surprise birthday wishes. The person we miss is Allen This is one of the best place which many people gives high rated. I'll give give them 6 stars.
4
We got to the restaurant at 7.50PM and they let us have our drinks on the 1 for 1 deal. We booked a table inside but asked to change to outside and the staff moved us as soon as a table became free. Great customer service.
5
We just missed the 8pm light show at MBS so rather than hang around we decided to head across the river to Overeasy for some dinner and to watch the later show from there. You do not get the full effect as you do not have the music but you can see the lights and lasers and it was enough for us. We had the "World Famous Philly Cheesesteak Sliders" as a starter and they were so good we had the same again! Our waiter was friendly, chatting with my son while I went to take photos and service was good. If you have a Singapore Airlines or Silk Air boarding pass you can get a 15% discount here
2
Service is bad and we have to wait for 20 mins for a wine glass! All the staff are doing nothing but don't bother to give us a wine glass
4
Vivienne has great customer service attributes! She was attentive to all our needs. Pleasant experience in general
4
food wise would be good but ambience is a little too dark for me (personally). it would be better if u go in group.
5
Great food and staff!We are in Sg for social visit and we able to dine in one fullerton and choose Overeasy..Place is great,from view of the Marina Bay Sands where you can watch the Lazer show,the ambiance of the place.Its really one of the perfect place to dine and be comfy
4
Good service, prompt and polite. excellent view and the food was great. Will definitely recommend and return.
4
Pleasantly surprised with a complimentary dessert, balloon and polaroid photo for my mum in celebration of Mothers' Day. But was told I could use my name to get the members card discount (I forgot to bring my card), but was denied of it when billing. Will be more efficient if we're able to enjoy members' discount just by using our ID or mobile number
4
Tried the Truffle burger, was not bad but kinda lacking, their truffle fries were quite good though. Tried their chilli cheese fries and breaded wings and found them pretty good. The setting and ambience of the place was pretty good and have a fantastic view outdoors. Service was not bad as well
1
While the view was great, and the prices average, the payment was a pain. They had my credit card for over 30 minutes, they at one point said I did not give them my credit card, then the manager came with my credit card and said "oh so sorry"They of course left the 10% service charge on the bill. Which at the end of the day I couldn't even care about because the next day *FRAUDULENT* charges on my credit card started to appear. I have raised this with my bank and will see what their fraud investigation discovers.I suggest anyone visiting this establishment pay with cash only
5
Went for a quick burger..... So good!Truffle mac n cheese is awsome too. Great cocktails and the perfect setting on Marina Bay.
3
Service was not up to standard. Service staff did not respond to us and even asked others to serve us even though he noticed us waving to him and he wasn't doing anythin
3
We went to try their famous truffle burgers. The four of us were disappointed as the burgers were nothing special, neither good or bad, just very simple burgers. None of us really felt the truffle taste at all. Obviously not worth the price. Fries and ambiance are good however
5
The GM was hardworking, the ambience was great & lively. the staff was very helpful. overall was super good. a good place to chill out, great music,not too loud not too soft. a place where you can chill,food,sit stand & talk. super loving it. the staffs made over easy the place to be at all the time. definitely a must go back there. Shout out to all the staffs and definitely the GM. GREAT TEAM WORK GREAT PLACE TO BE. OVEREASY ANYTIME ALL DAY EVERY DA
2
This is the most overpriced burger I had. BigMac is much more better than the burger I had. Paying $35 for an oily awful burger. The portion was small, the meat was not fresh with the unpalatable bun. The decoration of the shop is nice but the restaurant was too warm and it really uncomfortable. In conclusion, it's not a good restaurant to recommend. The only good thing is the service was good
5
Had a surprise birthday celebration planned for a friend. Staff was kind to accommodate to our requests even though we came in a big group (approx. 15 pax). Syahrul was helpful in the planning and execution of the surprise and gave us plenty of options and suggestions. the rest of the waiting staff were very spontaneous and pro-active in taking orders, serving of meals, etc. venue was great for large crowds as the staff managed to cater to our group. definitely a recommended place to host birthday parties. food was excellent and served according to expectations. the genuine smile on the staff faces makes the dining experience even more worthwhile. definately will be my go-to place for small celebrations in the future! Well done, staff of Overeasy
5
My first time holding a birthday party at Overeasy. It was simply fantastic.Reserved a table for 10. The Manager Syahrul was accomodating to get us the best seats. He surprised us with balloons n party hats that blends with the party atmosphere! We had a nice view too!Food was fantastic, the burger was literally "TO DIE FOR" & the dessert was awesome! I would definitely come again to savour among other great foods on the menu!Service was fast and staffs were friendly and professional. A+++
5
Food is great. Ambience is fantastic! You have to be here when you're around, or even in Singapore. Service is top notch superb
5
I celebrated my birthday here and the food were awesome. Price was fair and portion was sufficient. The service was quick and reliable. This staff goes by the name of syarul was very polite and friendly. I enjoyed my time here, you should too
5
Went with a bunch of friends for dinner. Food was great and drinks were even better. Ambience and service on point! Not to mention the beautiful view. Overall an amazing evening! Thanks OverEasy
2
Service staff was not pro active and had charcoal face throughout our lunch. Food served was slow as well. Took twenty minutes for the burgers to be served
3
drink ok -sliders great - rosemary fries good and veggie platter could have had more veggies - they are cheap - any way the sauces accompanying were tasty - place to go and look and be seen - very difficult to talk as soo noisy with the music very loud even inside good view of mbs from outside seatin
4
Recommend outdoor if its not a humid or raining day, tried all 3 levels of spicy chicken wings..still prefer level 1 though I love spicy food with chili Padi.
5
Great place for great food & drinks at affordable prices. Not to mention excellent attentive service provided by staff Gregory who even remembered the wine we had during our last visit!
5
Surprise browny cake from the staffs of Overeasy. Thanks guys especially to ALLAN & Syarul for the arrangement. Two thumbs up! 
4
Went there for a happy hour session with my friends and we all enjoyed the dinner and drinks at Over Easy
4
Had a birthday party here. The management were very helpful with the arrangements and contactable on WhatsApp. No minimum spend required to book an outside area for the night. The view is amazing.We ordered platters of food which was better than most pub grub. Service was slow from time to time with ordering drinks. delicious. Better than most 
4
The service was great and the ambience was perfect for a date. We enjoyed ourselves with loads of burgers, beers, music and people watching.
5
Great place with a great atmosphere and awesome view of the marina bay. Had meals and drinks with a few friends. The staff was friendly and the service was prompt. Definitely a good place to chill
4
I pre booked our dinner to coincide with sunset prior to our arrival in Singapore via Chope (restaurant app) requesting to be seated with a good view which is exactly what we received. We were there during happy hour also which makes drinks much more affordable. Our food choices were kept to some snacks which were good also
5
My favorite go to place for dinner, drinks, and a nice view of the light show.
Looking forward for another evening here!
5
Great place by the river for after work drinks with friends
Lovely, accommodating servers who go above and beyond.....
5
Awesome service! The best! Good staff and drinks. Look for Matthew and Ari. Chicken Wings are pretty good as well.
4
Service was great and quick. Food was alright but I chose this place because of the atmosphere so I have no qualms with the food! :)
5
Had a good time!! Nice food and service!! They managed to surprise us by birthday cake and song! Very pleasant !! Best time
5
Overeasy really, has one of the best views in town and the night view at the surrounding areas are sooooo good. just make a request if you have birthday celebrations, a small kind gesture will be arranged with a few bubbly staff singing the birthday song. we had two, and two brownies!thanks for making this such a memorable casual dinner out!
4
It is a great place to hang out specially if you get the outdoor seating in the evenings.. Their cocktails are one of my favorites. If you stick around for a while, you might even see the light show at Marina Bay Sands.Real estate is the biggest charm of the place with decent food and drinks. Service is good but could be bette
5
It was my birthday month, the staff was friendly and also prepared me with a birthday cake surprise. They also sang bday songs for me. I had a lovely night
4
We decided to head out to Overeasy at One Fullerton after work one day. The crowd was decent on a Monday evening, but not overly crowded. We were there relatively early, managed to get a nice table near the river bank. We weren't too hungry and got spicy chix wings and fries with minced beef along with our drinks. The happy hour promotion till 8pm was good and we particularly enjoyed the spicy wings (we chose level 3 spice). It was really spicy but worked for us as we enjoy 'spicier than usual' food.The waiter who attended to us, ARIE, was very approachable and attentive. He came by to check on us after serving the food. Seeing how much we enjoyed the chix, he shared with us some background on how the dish came about. ARIE was also very quick to share more about the Fizzy Gin and the ingredients that made the drink when we commented that it was very refreshing. He is a good staff, making a point to introduce a variety of whiskies when one of us indicated a liking for Japanese whiskies. Overall, a good location (fr CBD) and nice pub snack
2
Food was fine but service was so bad. Plenty more places to eat burgers so won't be visiting again in a hurry.
5
We were celebrating our colleagues' birthday over lunch, friendly waitress and waiter were very helpful. We have their signature burgers they are fantastic.
5
Been there many times and it never fails to be a perfect experience in terms of food, ambience, scenery, service.
4
Ate here having just arrived in Singapore. We wanted something easy for our first evening. The music was quite loud but waiting staff happily found a less loud spot upon our request. We both had burgers and fries and enjoyed them both. I tried the truffle oil fries for SGD$2 extra, not sure I would if I was there again. We had bayside seats and watched the light show over the MBS.
5
came here of Friday night drink. We wanted to seat outdoor- smoking area however all tables were already reserved and what impressed us the most is how azwan went extra mile and got us a portable table.he sees to it that we are well taken care of in spite of such busy operation. Food and the view may be awesome but the warm welcome and excellent service is what we will always come back for
5
Great place to chill, relax and drink. Especially the service rendered by Azwan! He is a gem to the service industry! Keep it u
5
Was here to celebrate a friend's birthday and had lots of fun! Service was good and supervisor azwan made it even better by providing complimentary drinks for the birthday boy to bring more happiness to us!
5
Had a great experience with friends and there was excellent service with the friendly staff all around serving the area with delight and respect
5
Came here for dinner with my wife and had very good service from the host Ms Vevien . we requested for @table332 and even though it was reserve , she tactfully agreed to make arrangement so we can have that table . Because of her arrangement , we also made a new german friend sitting next to us ! Bravo 
4
Great view with great service and fantastic 1 for 1 deals for drinks and good food. Great place to relax with friends after a day in the office
4
Reasonable value business lunch. Had carrot soup as starter and followed by linguine with prawns as main course.
5
The service here is good, the view is nice, the workers are friendly. The supervisor Azwan provides very good service. .
5
The place is good and the food is very good. The supervisor azwan is Friendly and the service is good.................
4
We wanted to check out Overeasy as it was featured in Chope's list of best burger places in Singapore. We went there for a late dinner at about 11pm and they only have the supper menu. We had the "To die for" burger with fries and we have to admit that it is definitely one of the best burgers we have tried in SG! The patty was delicious and not too dry; sauce was good with a mixture of mustard and mayonnaise. Fries was well-cooked, not too oily with sprinkles of herbs.
5
Located just in front of MBS, wine and dine just before the sunset its amazing! If you like classic American comfort food this is the place to be. Awesome food with friendly and attentive service crew. I definitely recommend this place!
2
Food not up to mark. Despite requesting for a table with kids, was given high rise bar table. My kids could barely reach the table! The hostess was completely not accommodating
5
Love to hangout at the place. Good food. Great service. Will always come back there. The view is nice. It's not over crowded. The staff was attentive. Pretty much enjoy myself everytime I come by for drinks.
4
we were there for birthday celebration.. the service was awesome.. the restaurant outdoor had great view.. food was nice..
4
This was a fantastic find in Singapore! My coworker and I walked over here from the Ce La Vie bar atop the Marina Bay Sands and sat outside. It was late and we had dessert first at Lady M so we shared the large appetizer combo platter with hot dogs, fries, wings and veggies. It was quite good and we especially loved our cocktails! We enjoyed this place so much that we ended up coming back two nights later with our other coworkers to celebrate the end of our work trip. Several of us ordered burgers, mine was wonderful. One of the best burgers I've had in a while. Another ordered the truffle mac n' cheese which was also great! Someone else ordered the wings with level 3 sauce and they were SPICY! I LOVE really spicy food and the server saw me dipping my fries in the leftover wing sauce so she brought me my own, without me having to even ask...now that is service! Overall, a fun place...would definitely go again my next visit in Singapore
4
Overeasy is a great place to eat by the water if you want something fun and casual. The staff are very friendly (always smiling) and the food is casual and fairly cheap. Spend an afternoon here outside overlooking Marina Bay sands
5
Staff were friendly, offering us milk after we suffered the wrath of level 10 wings. When a slight drizzle started, they rushed to offer us comfortable seats inside.
4
We were just there for drinks and not the food. The cocktails were lovely and while not cheap, they were more reasonably priced than some other cocktail establishments. Ambience was definitely better outdoors, but there's no shelter from the rain, which is a shame (drizzled while we were there and everyone fled indoors). Staff were friendly and helpful. We will return, possibly trying the food next round
4
Western food done well. Great selection of drinks and music. Attentive waitstaff. Rustic atmosphere.Lighting just a bit dim and music too loud.
4
View was fabulous. We asked for a nice table with good view over the bay and that is what we got. Great experience! Food was okay, not too expensive.
4
Service is really quick and efficient and the staff are all really friendlyi ordered the mac & cheese and the burger & truffle fries and they did not disappoint kudos to the kitchen and the wait staff
5
I celebrated my 19th birthday at Overeasy, One fullerton and I had a pleasant experience. I must commend one of their staff, Mango, who was very accommodating and patient. The food and ambience was great too. Overall, i had a great experience
5
The burger and truffle fries are amazing. Service is really quick and efficient and the staff are all really friendly
5
I had a birthday party there last week following my friend's recommendation and it was awesome. Arie, the person managing our table, was very friendly, attentive and flexible. The rest of the crew was great too. This kind of customer service is not common in Singapore. Location and view are unbeatable. It rained when we were there but the staff quickly arrange indoor tables for us. Food is pretty good. The only thing I'd change is that I wish the veggie dip (starter) has a bigger portion
5
Not the 1st time there. Thinking of food and alcohol? Overeasy was always the place I go. Nice plac
3
Have eaten there a number of times - always lunch. THe good - good value set menu, food always consistent (a few salads, pasta with seafood, burgers etc.). Excellent coffee. The bad - the service can be very erratic at lunch - dishes forgotten, one dish brought to table (for two) and long wait while they find the other one and often appears a bit slapdash. But this is (for Singapore's CBD) a relatively cheap place for a sit down lunch and it has never been so irritating as to stop me coming back
4
I just wanted to grab a burger and a beer one night and this place didn't let me down. Food was great and the typical happy hour "bogo" Tiger beer doesn't hurt. Waitress struggled through our order, bringing us someone else's order and then confusing our drink order. She was new and just learning the ropes, so it's to be expected
3
The better view of Marina Bay in my opinion. Bar food that works. Casual atmosphere. Maybe too busy for the amount of service people but helpful and cheerful.
4
Good food and service. The staffs were all prompt in attending to my friends and I. Love the buffalo wings. Will definitely be back for more
4
Really nice place!American 50-is style.Classic American food.Awesome place if you want to watch the light show at Marina sands bay!Prob one of the best views
3
We went here for dinner while on holiday in Singapore a few months ago and were seated outside. I would definitely recommend sitting outside so you can get a good view of the nightly laser show from Marina Bay Sands hotel across the water. We ordered the nachos for starters which was pretty tasty though I wish they had more of the dipping sauces as we had run out by the time we were half way through the plate. When it came to main course my boyfriend ordered the grilled cheese sandwich and fries while I ordered the mac and cheeks. His food came out first and after ten minutes of waiting our waitress brought my food out but explained that they had run out of the Mac and cheeks and made plain Mac and cheese instead. She did offer to bring me something else but it would have meant another wait of 20 minutes or so. Despite the wait and being disappointed that the food I received was not what I originally asked for it was still a nice experience and would like to visit again in the future.
1
There was a cockroach running on the wall where we were sitting. It took some time for the staff to find someone to clear that another diner bravely caught it. No explanations was provided to the diners affected nor discount to show apologies.
4
Good ambience, nice food and not that pricey though location is not that convenient. Will go back again! :
1
Almost lost my friend's credit card and took very long to find . Not only that food v salty . Not recommended
1
Incredibly poor service, poor quality expensive food ( for serving size) . Watched many dishes come from the kitchen and do 3 or 4 laps of the dining area before going back in and then returning. Well travelled meals. Our two starters arrived 15 mins apart! Had to give people on table next to us cutlery as they didn't have enough forks and waiter wasn't interested in diners. Not happy!
4
The first time I was here it was later at night; we had a drink and enjoyed the view. We were back a couple of weeks ago for a bite and drink. We arrived during happy hour, which apparently is a 1 for 1 promotion.I had a burger which was good. This was a weekday and there were many people there, both inside and outside; it is a popular place. However, when I ordered a beer (glass of draft) with their 1 for 1 promotion, it turns out that they bring both glasses at the same time. What could be wrong with this idea, what with the usual temperature in Singapore?I finished the first two relatively quickly, as when we arrived we were hot and thirsty. However, after ordering again, when we left, the second beer was also left, warm on the table
3
Great setting, good food - loads of staff but terrible service. We had to wait 20 mins before we were even noticed to be served, this was at 5pm when the area was empty. Staff were either standing around chatting or just day dreaming. Service improved when we moved inside and complained.
4
We went for a lunch in this restaurant after visiting the marlion. The service was quite friendly and nice. The food was quite American style, so the burgers were very good and tasty, so was the truffle fries not to miss. The beer should have been colder. The view of the bay and the people passing by and the occasional Dow was nice to look at. The downside of this restaurant is the lack of fans outside specially with the humidity. Also this restaurant should better organize the reservations management or to complete remove it. And should put in place first come first seated. As I don't find logical that the staff toTells you that particular table is reserved 2 hours in advanced and that you should switch soon. They should remember that nobody come on time
5
Although we wanted to sit outside and enjoy the view, it was full and we didn't want to wait long (one of my friends was quite "hangry" at that point) so we dined inside. Fortunately, I enjoyed the Buffalo Wings and the Truffle Burger was one of the best burgers I've had. Our server was also very friendly and quick every time we asked for something
4
The restaurant is spacious but the waitress is not so friendly. There are seat at outside of restaurant for marina view but a little too hot. Overall is satisfying
3
Fullerton Outletstaff service was even better than the manager.food: so-soPrice: reasonableAmbience: perfect  
1
We had 5 people, ate angus ribeye (most expensive dish) ordered it medium rare but it was over welldone... Dessert we got no utensils, asking them few times then got 1 too less but waiter never listened what we said. Only thing which worked was the bill which was way too much to quality. Shame as location is good...poor place, never come again
5
I have been to OverEasy numerous times and I admit, I am boring, same burger every time (Double Trouble), but it is sooooo good!!! Love it. Plus the buffalo wings are awesome. Service is excellent. If you love your burgers, it's a must visit. To the level that I now hate ordering burgers from other restaurants
4
Came here with friends to chill out. The view is beautiful and the service is really great. We sat on the sofa seats which were comfortable and good. Place gets really crowded during weekends.Not much vegetarian options and not many finger food items at night. We had the m&m and orea milkshake was great. definitely a worth to try for non-alcohol drinkers
4
The truffle mac n cheese wasn't as nice I thought. However, the service and view was impeccable, making up for it.  
5
Food is very decent and the service is really good. They are always attentive and friendly. Thumbs up  
5
We stopped for a beer at early evening. You get the fantastic view of the marina bay. There is a happy hour to get 1+1 on drinks. On usual times the prices are a bit high. Recommend (!
5
I have been in Singapore for 10 years and I have never had such amazing customer service! Last night I celebrated my birthday with 5 other friends, made a reservation through Chope and was given a table outdoor with a great view. All the staff were so attentive, helpful and quick. They made my birthday memorable! They took a picture of our group with a polaroid camera personalizing the back with a message, my friend brought a cupcake and they were able to put on a plate with a birthday message and candle for no additional cost. After we wanted to go up to Ce La Vi but my guy friend was wearing shorts and slippers. So I checked if by chance one of the staff might have some old shoes and pants that we might be able to lend. Totally not expecting any help they managed to get it for me! They all went above and beyond to make my day special. Would definitely recommend OverEasy for a birthday celebration. They also have Beerpong (which we unfortunately didn't get to,next time!!) Thank you

Nice view, environment and good food. But the only things is when you order more happy hour beer and they will bring all out and cannot serve later. Overall I'll say good and recommended restaurant
4
I was right to come here only when it is not a busy Fri night. Most people prefer the view and rather sit outside. But I am fine inside with the air con which seems to switch off at 10pm.This time I was there with more friends and we ate a variety of food and service and cleanliness wise is improved. Food is better (order different things this time round) and it is served very quickly. I think the management may be trying to improve how the place is run and I think those who vowed not to visit should give it a second chance...But do put in more light...can hardly read the menu when night falls..

Excellent system and good reminder to the patron. Friendly and attentative servicing staff. But sliders beef patty are getting too thin  
4
No where else offers a better view of Marina Bay Sands than OverEasy. Sitting there, facing that awesome view, having a Mac&Cheese with beer and nothing else will matter! A perfect place for Happy Hour after a day of hard work and madness at the office.The staff are friendly and helpful. Especially Jonathan Lim. He'll never give you a 'no' for an answer but will try his best to accommodate your request. Even if it's not possible, he'll always offer an alternative or option. Service staff who are passionate about their job are hard to find but Jonathan is that and more.

Had the BLAT burger and paid +$2 to upgrade the fries to Truffle fries. While the burger was decent, i found the fries overcooked. Also had the Oreo Milkshake which thankfully had maintained its standard
5
This is a place worth a visit, they offer a very reasonable happy hour and excellent food especially the prawn linguine!! The staff were fantastic especially Riza a young lady waitress who could not have been more helpful and courteous to me and my wife while we were there. This is a great watering hole after a hot trip around Singapore and has great views of the Bay!!
4
The location is perfect with a great view to the Marina Bay hotel (at night it is even better). We had only couple of drinks here so I cannot review the food (even the menu looked nice). In short: pretty good drinks, nice view, kind waitress
4
We had wonderful night! Although it was raining and it stopped, the staff was so friendly and willing to let us sit outdoor after they had wiped all the tables. And for the complimentary brownies, thanks ! Good environment but wish there would be more choices on the men
4
Large Selection, Fast Service, High Quality, Great Waterside View! You will not be disappointed with the Seafood, Wings, Appetizers, or deserts. A great happy hour will go gently on your wallet. MUST BE THERE FOR THE LIGHT SHOW AT 9PM
1
Booked online. Just wanted a quick burger before having a wander around the Quay. Really disappointing menu, so me and the man opted for a burger. Mine was just about edible but the man's burger which was medium rare was cold, as where his fries. 1 beer and one glass of wine and the bill was $87 . We left feeling ripped off and unhappy
5
Husband got a free brownie and staff sang happy birthday for him after i indicated in the comments that it is his birthda
5
Drinks specials. Sliders specials. Haze free Friday night. Free laser light shows by the river. Yeah
4
Staff are very friendly. Got a very nice view of sitting place. And the staff help me to surprise my boyfriend with a song and cake. I love it!
4
No seats but the maitre'de checked found a no show or late show and seated us sl,ow to pick up first order but food came akong ok the light show was fabulous great views of downtown
4
Very much enjoyed my experience here, food was tasty with a good size portion. The location really helps makes the experience.The service speed was ok but had to get the attention of the waiting staff a couple times to place my orders.
1
Me and my wife dined at this place since we heard that they serve good burgers and has nice ambience only to find out that their service suck likes most of restaurants in Singapore of course.The server who was at the dining area kept on walking and it felt so awkward eating with people looking at your every bite. They wouldn't even ask you if its alright to clear the plates this is worse than hawker centers! The food are so-so and the staff are not trained to give service, if they are tired just get the hell out of your workplace and sleep! Never coming back!
3
Good truffle burger, buffalo wings and spicy prawn linguine! service could have been faster though the servers were always with smiles. Will be back again
2
My friend and I waited for 15 minutes for place an order, and waited for more than 30 minutes for our food to be served.
4
The sliders were ok. Mushroom truffle soup was tasty with only a slight hint of truffle aroma. My husband had the truffle burger, which was absolutely delicious. Love the Te-qui-la Mockingbird cocktail, which had real pomegranate seeds. We went there to celebrate my husband's birthday and my reservation indicated that but alas, there was not even a birthday greeting by staff. Staff didn't check on satisfaction as well
5
it is not my first time to eat here but this is the first time i'm writing a review. Food is really good. Quality remains really good since the first time I've tried. Great view and people are really nice and will serve you well. Highly recommende
5
Overall good and nothing much to comment. Will visit again with my customers or family's. But now is just because of the haze problem.  
5
Excellent place to enjoy the MBS view, especially during the light show. Food and drinks are reasonable.
5
Went there last Friday and the staff there was friendly and attentive. They took time to explain the dishes to us. The night view of the bay from the restaurant was great. Ambience at the restaurant was also just right to chill out with friends over some finger food and drinks.
1
This place by far has the worst service I've experienced in Singapore! The waiter named "Nigel" was not happy to serve any person who came in and basically didn't want anyone around! Singapore got so many good places, I strongly recommend you don't waste your time at a place like "Over Easy"
4
great location that is for sure, on the reservoir bank. lively at night. The decoration looks a bit old now, same as 3-4 years ago. There was a DJ the night I was there, a bit too loud and the selection was very average, dance, not refined. Burgers where average.
4
Not bad, provided a complimentary brownie with personalized name and candles on it for my gf's birthday.Food was average, we ordered mac & cheese (so-so) and the overeasy burger (quite good, the sauce is pretty unique)
3
Food was not too bad but the service was not up to standard.After we had our dinner we went out to view the light from MBS and continue with our desert but the waitress was very rude when we was checking on the 1 for 1 UOB credit card offer.
3
My wife and i had dinner here whilst in singapore. Service was good but the food was very average considering it was talked about on the tv as thenplace to eat with fantastic burgers. Food was very over priced and of average quality. Good location to go for a drink while the do happy hour between 5 and 8 and see the light show at marina bay sands but thats about it
4
Service was attentive and swift, although had to wait slightly longer for one of the ordered drinks. Food was served very quickly after ordering, although the restaurant wasn't overly busy. Burgers were superb and cooked as ordered, side portion of fries were tasty but portion size was on the small side. Would definitely recommend.
4
Visited Chope for a friend's birthday and to our surprise, they have prepared balloons to welcome us. Staff was friendly and professional throughout from taking orders to serving the food. After the celebrations, they also took a polaroid for keepsake and made sure we were all in it. Overall, food is okay but will visit again for their service!
5
Sitting in the waterfront, temperature a pleasant 28 degrees and watching the light show from the marina sands towers. Enjoyed a majito (or two) on happy hour between 5pm-8pm. The wait staff Diana and Carissa made our experience our highlight in Singapore. A must visit
5
We chanced upon OverEasy when searching for a place with good food and nice ambience to celebrate a special occasion. We made a reservation for dinner and were allocated a booth seat in the restaurant. We had the Truffle Burger, Chicken Burger, Waffle with chicken wings and the Mac and Cheese. The wagyu beef mince patty was done medium and it is one of the best burgers I had. The chicken burger with bacon is also a delight, not to mention the waffle with chicken wings. We requested to adjourn outside for drinks and dessert and were offered a couch seat when one became available. We had a couple of beers and ordered the Bourbon doughnut holes. We loved the little fried doughnuts which were hot and crispy and the chocolate fudge dip.The view of Marina Bay is simply amazing. The laser show from Marina Bay Sands is stunning too.Though at times we had to get the attention of the staff, they are prompt in their service, except when getting the bill, as that took them some time, this I guess was due to the crowd on a weekend.OverEasy is a great place and we have added this to our list of favourite places to chill out and to bring foreign friends when they are here for a visit
5
The burger here is probably one of the better one's I've tried in Singapore. To add to that you've a nice view while eating it. It's also a pretty good spot for evening drinks
4
always love the view over here!! But the waiter ain't that friendly, and it could be quite hot if you are seating outside they should put some fan    
5
We watched Insider TV at our Hotel and decided to try out OverEasy Fullerton venue. We were very happy with the service from Nigel and our meals were exceptional. The view wasn't bad either
5
Great ambience for late outing with friendlies!! Awesome place for a birthday drink! Especially for the birthday treat! Superb!Thank you Azwan for making it awesome and memorable! Must look for him
5
We recently had a couple of drinks at OverEasy (opposite Marina Bay Sands Hotel). The view was just amazing. The staff were so kind. We were part of the #celebrateSG50 campaign from Singapore Airlines. Our special thanks goes out to VIVIEN & SANTHINI who made our evening complete. Those girls were so enthusiastic and chatty, we had so much fun!!! I wish all cafÃ©s and restaurants had staff like them in it! We'll be coming back on our next trip for the good service, magnificent view and the wonderful staff
4
Stopped in for the diner experience and was not disappointed. Our family of 5 was seated in a booth and given a typical diner menu with a whole page of diner drink classics. We opted for the chocolate shake, sugar and spice, and root beer floats. Delicious! Loved the milo topping on the chocolate shake, a bit different from the usual whipped cream. We also tried the fried brussel sprouts, also delicious. The main dishes were not as much of a hit as the appetiser and drinks. :( Four of us had the burgers and one had chicken and waffles. I have to disclose that we are burger snobs and really are tough critics. They were cooked medium (as ordered) and were a very generous portion. Overall, we enjoyed our meal and would recommend this diner experience. Only thing missing is a jukebox!!!
2
Overall disappointing, very slow service, incorrect orders, very pricy coming with the typical answers: "so sorry"...One pays for the view and the fair atmosphere.
4
Great staffs with the waiter junwei. Came by to chill with bunch of my friends . Told him that it's my friend's birthday, few minutes later he came out with a brownie singing birthday songs. Definitely a good thumbs up for junwei.😊
5
Nice ambiance , excellent angus ribeye. Great view. Weather was a little warm in singapore though. Liked the service provided by floor staff , Nigel. Prompt and attentive. Great job! Would definitely pop by OverEasy on my trip to singapore next time.
4
Good ambience and nice place to chillout for a good drinks.
With some nice music and good crowd.
Will come back again for sure
4
I went to chill out with my friends. Love their desserts the most. Try the chocolate skillet. Excellent night view if you are seat at the alfresco area.
3
Food was generally okay but service was a bit slow. Drinks took 20 mins to come even after reminding the service staff. But seriously, $6 for canned drinks which didn't filled the glasses is a bit expensive.
3
mushroom soup was nice but generally food was of average standard. Dessert was slightly above average 
3
Tried the new Orchard branch. This being below street level, the view is of some sad steps leading up to Orchard Road, or a bright green fruit juice kiosk - definitely not sunny side up! Very friendly waiters/waitresses, but the wait for food can be rather long, as the kitchen is either understaffed or badly organized. The gumbo - a tasteless and very liquid soup - is definitely not from a New Orleans créole recipe; maybe after somebody accidentally dropped a bucket of water in the pan. Other dishes are OK, but you can find better burgers or Reuben sandwiches elsewhere on Orchard Road. Way overpriced for the quality. Clientèle is mainly homesick American families or local & Asian youth
4
Although there wasn't any gluten and dairy free options on the menu the staff was great at finding what we could eat and altering meals slightly. My wife was unwell and we had to leave early and the staff were very kind and gave her water, and packaged up her meal and gave advice on the quickest way to get home. Recommend this place and the fantastic staf
5
We organised a corporate event here and I have to say everything went seamlessly. We were seated within our reserved area immediately. Staff were informative and friendly. Food was good! And drinks at happy hour were reasonably priced (by singapore standards) what stood out was customer service. Efficient and handled our multiple bills easily. Thank you to staff member Nigel for serving us and making the whole experience and very positive one.

I've been to OverEasy more than a few times as it's become a bit of a tradition. The food is okay but the location and view is great. What has been consistently abysmal, however, is the service. Every time it's as if everyone working there is on their first day. I'd be understanding if that was actually the case but I know it's not the truth. Nobody seems to know how anything is run, let alone how service is supposed to be conducted. It's become a bit of a running joke at how bad it is. Every time we say 'never again'. I guess we only have ourselves to blame.Whether it's waiting 2 hours for your food, 2 hours for your bill or, the latest (and not the first time this has happened), bringing you the bill before you've finished ordering and demanding that you settle it and open a tab before, say, ordering dessert. When questioned, they say it's 'standard procedure' but that doesn't take away from the fact that it is bizarre and ultimately self-defeating as it led to us leaving in protest much earlier than planned.Here's something for the staff of OverEasy to keep in mind; 'standard procedure' in a restaurant is actually this; people expect an order to take substantially less for 2 hours to arrive, to be able order until they are finished ordering, at which point they will ask for the bill when they are ready (and without being bullied into opening a tab), and for that bill not to take 2 hours to arrive and require 5 requests (true story).Sadly OverEasy fails in every respect and it's simply not worth the frustration. You ruined my leaving do but, to be honest, I know how bad you are and so I only have myself to blame.
5
We had excellent food, superb ambience and rocking staff especially, thank you Nigel :-) for the excellent hospitality
5
It has been an awesome experience. The food is simply great and the staff are friendly and attentive. Strongly recommend! Special thanks to Niger, who provide us with an excellent service and such a pleasant evening at at Overeasy!
4
Right across the water from Marina Bay sands ... great view. We were there late (after 11 pm) and so unable to eat, but it was nice to sit and enjoy the view with a couple of beer.
5
So I went to Overeasy on a Friday, 25th July 2015. Nigel is 10/10. Personal, down to earth, and being so understandable. One of the nice Singaporeans ever to live. Legend. I'm coming back every week.
5
We had office night out on a last Friday evening. We had a large group of people, hence I was quite anxious on the arrangements. To my dismay they are true professionals and extremely friendly with our variety of drink orders . Everything was fulfilled by Nigel of course. Platters and snacks are just nice for large group of people. Finally our party was a big hit! Thank you guys!!! Definitely a must go!!! Cheers!

So last saturday me and my husband went to Overeasy. Since we heard that it's one of the best view for fireworks for national day. The ambiance is good, there's happening, the DJ got the mood and vibes of music and everyone seems to be enjoying. We never had a reservation and it looks fully book coz no one is entertaining us, so we decided to hang in the bar area wherein we ordered some drinks cocktail for me and beer for my husband. It's good that we are entertained well by the staff even if it's quite busy. I met Diana who keeps asking if we need something to eat and she also suggested drinks since she saw that my husband's drink is almost finished. She also told us that if there's an available table she'll try to help us get one. It's a great experience though it's busy type restaurant but the service is still there. We're not expecting anything more but what's good is we are overwhelmed by initiative and care by the staff. We'll visit again soon before we flight off to our hometown. Suggesting everyone to go down, chill, relax and experience something unforgettable. :

Went to this restaurant last night (27 July) to celibate our daughters 9th birthday, while on holiday in Singapore.We booked an outside table to watch the Marina Bay laser show. The staff soon found out it was my daughters birthday and were very attentive.The burgers were very tasty, as was desert. I finished off with a malted shake that was the best shake I have ever had, although at $12 I'd expect it to be good.The highlight was when the staff surprised us by bringing out a large brownie complete with candle and my daughters name written on the plate in chocolate sauce. They then sang happy birthday to my daughter. Exellent service and a very nice touch
3
I do not think I will return on a busy night...too noisy for my liking. I wasn't expecting a bar, bistro type of feel.A conversation requires some shouting. American restaurant but the portion is not. Food wise I think it alright...plausible, nothing to rave about. Had The Truffle burger and mushroom soup.Spotted at least two ants on my table the time I was there, and dried food on a "clean" spoon...But the place is crowded...so maybe go there for drinks after work..
5
I have had some experiences with Overeasy, and to be honest they weren't the mosy satisfactory. When a place is so overcrowded with orders, I was not expecting my requests to be delivered as promptly. And then I met Nigel Koh, he was just a waiter but he was the most dedicated waiter I have ever met in my life. From my first experience, I knew he was the guy I have to turn to to get the drinks and food I wanted. Not surprisingly, he managed to deliver everything I requested for, sometimes even earlier than what I had expected. Since then, I will always approach Nigel for my orders because I am confident that he will deliver on his promise, Having been born in Singapore, and knowing how Singaporeans loathe a service job, and honestly, where foreign workers are more than happy to do the job, I am thoroughly happy and impressed with Nigel's attitude throughout the whole night even though on some instances I may have given him difficulties. In a nutshell, I have given up hope on service staffs in SG until I met Nigel and I can assure u that he will be the only reason I'll visit Overeasy again (if he's still working there that is).
3
Service wasn't great. We have to ask for water and forks and waiters were not attentive. My order of linguine with prawns look so long to arrive and I have to ask the waiter to check my order after waiting for more than half an hour. All my colleagues has almost finished eating
4
Amazing view, great food and awesome service from our friendly waiter Jun Wie!
Will def be back again!
5
We had a great night out. Great views and excellent customer service. All thanks to Azman who looked after us throughout the night!
5
Awesome venue to watch National Day rehearsals! Book an outside table and enjoy the flyovers & fireworks
4
we were seated inside on the high chair. Food was served promoptly and the service crew was attentive, especially Elise, the floor manager who was fantastic.
4
We were here for a business lunch - about 6 of us. The place seems ideal for most kind of groups - families, couples, business folks - it's casual and has an easy atmosphere.We had different things: Burgers, Salmon Salad, the Broccoli-Quinoa Salad, Truffle Mac n Cheese, and. Truffle Fries. The Broccoli-Quinoa salad was light and refreshing - the flavours were balanced out with sweetness from raisins, salty tang from the feta and lemon dressing. The Truffle Mac n Cheese was really good too, though I would've liked a little more cheese in it!The best part of the meal was easily the Milkshakes - gargantuan, creamy, delicious. We had various ones - Strawberry, Chocolate, Malt. I loved the Malt, and would definitely go back specially for it
1
We made a reservation via Chope a week ahead. The night before they emailed us back cancelling the booking. Very poor form
4
Had a good night with my fam, great light show from MBS, good food and superb location. Waiting staff was doing a great job, with Nigel making sure everything was covered throughout the night! Big improvement over the last time I was there about half a year ago
3
The onion rings were cold and the linguine was not spicy as claimed. Went for lunch and felt hot in the restaurant. Could not feel the air con. Received a few auto calls confirmation on my reservation even though I had already confirmed earlier. Quite irritating.
4
Went there for lunch in the middle of the week with a friend. Thought I would try it out because it had the most people in it along the water.Ordered a couple of burgers, some onion rings and one soda water. Took a little while to get the onion rings which started to annoy me, but they were well worth the wait. Really crunchy, big and not too greasy. Yum. The burgers were also very good. Fresh ingredients, the patty didn't seem machine made and the cheese was perfectly melted on top. They had great flavor, as a matter of fact I would probably rate it one of my top 3 burgers in Singapore.No comes the reason why they lose a star or should I say dot. $78 for the meal. Ouch that seems excessive to me for lunch with no beer. I had dinner at Alt Pizza the same night. 3 pizzas, spinach salad, bacon cheese fries and a glass of milk an it was the same price. Something just doesn't add up at Overeasy. Maybe there rent is ridiculous. I am not sure I will go back because the price just hurt too much
5
Thumbs up to Marco service!!! He is attentive and sincere in his service. He never fails to go the extra mile to provide us with excellent service! Always amazed and surprised by his unexpected service provided! Thanks Marco for making me and friends feeling comfortable chilling at overeasy after work! Marco is the best!!!:
5
I brought my friend here to celebrate her birthday. Good food. Great service. Great view. 10/10 would recommend! Shoutout to Jon and Jerrold for being such excellent waiters. :)
5
Servers Jerrold and Izwan were amazing! Such lovely guys! Jerrold even saved us from a bunch of drunk patrons who threatened to ruin our girls night with their persistence to get our digits. You go boys!!
See you there soon!
5
We really enjoyed our happy hour drinks and food, and Marco made it special. We only wanted a drink and ended up having just a bIt more than that :-)))) thank you Marco for hooking us up:-)! You served us well😀
5
It was a good night out. Had food drinks and good. Servers were good and attentive. I even requested for a balloon though it was not my bday and I got it! Awesome!
5
This is mine 1st time come to over easy and I really enjoy myself tonight thank to Marco for introduce some of the food and I feel so great it make me feel like a home than a restaurant I would ask my friend to join me here at Overeasy with friendly staff and the beautiful view I would come back more and a million thankful to Marco

Ten family and friends, including four children under 9 years old, decided to eat at OverEasy on a week night. From the smiling welcome onwards it was a very pleasant evening. Nothing was a trouble and, in deed, was a pleasure. The food is mainly burgers, and most of the adults had those. The "To Die For Burger" was well named and perfectly cooked and served. You even get a choice of how well the meat is cooked....Rare, medium, etc. The specials were very compelling. Until 7pm the sliders, small hamburger patties served on a small bun, were $1 each and three each were perfect, with fries, for the four children. So so cheap and they loved them, too. There was also a special on the beers till 8pm, with two for one prices which made them excellent value too. Heartily recommend OverEasy for a casual meal
5
I am rating this restaurant 11 out of 10! The staff, Diana, Jon and all the rest were simply amazing! Very attentive to our needs, always easy to get their attention when we needed something. Whenever, they walked past our table, in spite of being very busy, they always pause to check if everything is ok. When we mentioned in passing about celebrating my friend's birthday, one of the staff, Diana took her initiative and went the extra mile to organise a birthday cake for my friend. Wow! Totally impressed with the service. They are also very good at making small talk to bring positive energy to the whole dining experience. The food is also very good. The mojitos at S$10 plus are excellent. Will definitely to return to OverEasy with friends
5
The burger , cheese and fries here are really nice. My friend who very choosy in taste of a burger crazily happy about the burger here. Must try ! . The milkshake here is very nice too , it's milky enough to melts. Last but not least, I had a proposal here and she said Yes ! . Thanks for the support from Allan,Jocelyn,Riza and all the staff that helping.to setup for the proposal and birthday celebration. The environment is nice , view is superb and nice food. Come visit and have a drink or two with your love ones. It will definitely be a good experience. Cheers
4
There were about 40 of us, outside last friday night the 19th june, On 2 long tables plus people standing around coming and going. The staff were amazing, Marco our waiter was there all the time, as soon as we wanted something, it was there. Also Alan the manager, he was so helpful, and both of them together made 40 people feel very special. The view from Overseay is amazing , looking over to the Mariana bay Sands hotel, the buzz was lively, friendly , and not to loud or over bearing . We will definitely be returning
4
Nice place for drinks and food especially at night. Request for al fresco as you bask in the beautiful Singapore River skyline. Go for their mini burgers and truffle fries which are really nice. Quite pricey though but what can you expect with such fantastic view.
5
We love OverEasy. Especially Marco --- he was a very attentive sever, super personal and friendly. Service was exceptional, and Marco made us feel at home!!! We love Marco!!!
4
when we arrived the place was around 7.30pm and is was crowned. However the food was very good and portion sizes were very generous and they have a staff name Marco if I didn't remember wrongly the one wearing black glasses. He was a very attentive sever and friendly to us. The food was here particular! If you enjoy American food I would definitely recommend you to pay a visit here
5
We've been living in Singapore for four years and we chose Over Easy for our leaving do. Great view of MBS and the laser show, relaxed atmosphere, efficient staff led by Marco and some good happy hour deals. One of our favourite spots in Singapore. We've brought all our visitors here and we have many fond memories of the place
5
We were served by manager, Allan. Despite having a full house on a Friday night, he was very attentive towards our requests and gave excellent service throughout the night. A place we will choose to unwind after a long day at work. Great job to the team too
5
decided to introduce my UK pal , Raj to Overeasy to dine for a casual evening who lived and worked here for 12 years. Even though there's no Stellar-beer which we wanted , but we decided to stay here because of the service , atmosphere and friendly faces. Jocelyn , the door host brought me to my reservation and almost immediately , Nigel attended to me. Although I'm alone while waiting for my wife and my buddy to arrive , Nigel kept me company. I'll say that he was proactive , and attentive through the night. We've made some comments about the food , expressing that it can be improved as it wasn't what it was a year ago and we were glad to meet the head chef , Teo WeiKiat who took our suggestions on board with a jovial face promising improvements. We are confident that our suggestions would be addressed and improvements would be made. This is so much better than any other restaurants in Singapore or worldwide! AWESOME OVEREASY! Well done!! We'll definitely be back for more
4
I shared a review earlier but it didn't seem to be published. Here I go again! This is our second time here at Overeasy. Fantastic service with Marco taking care of us. He's friendly, approachable, attentive and prompt. Thank you!! The view is fantastic, the service is great and the food is nice (before they go cold). Million thanks
4
It's our second time at Overeasy for a office gathering and it has been a fabulous experience. This time round we have Marco taking care of us. He's friendly, approachable and attentive. Keep it up - the service, the food quality and the team! A million thanks !! We will be back!
5
First of all, i would like to commend on their great service, especially Mr. Azwan who served my table. He was really attentive to our needs and he is always cheery, polite and so approachable! Props to him and he is definitely an asset to the restaurant! Ok now for the location of the restaurant, it has a magnificant view of MBS and the Singapore River and it is a great avenue to catch the light show over at this restaurant! You will definitely enjoy dinning at this place and you will not regret making your way to this location! Highly recommended
5
I got my team here for a de-stressing evening out. We had an awesome time with the flow of drinks during happy hours and an awesome, friendly staff catering to all our demands.With a lot of focus on cost cutting in all organisations and, the amazing menu offered during happy hours, I believe this is the place for team building and socialising events.Priyali Naithan

We ordered the Truffle burger and it was a tad too miniature so the only saving grace was the truffle fries that we upgraded to. Then came along the mac & cheese which was seemingly portioned for kids meal. But it tasted quite alright as compared to the burger. Our server was a teenager who may be too eager to clear our plates when we were just halfway through our meal. Quite a rush isn't it. There was no crowd inside the restaurant at all. :/No more next visit obviously
5
Great evening with Nigel being a great host. Thank you Overeasy for catering to all the special request fufilled.
5
Great view and great location! Make sure to get there before 8 o’clock to have a perfect view of the lightshow. The service and food was amazing with an extra special shoutout to Jon, Weikong and Syahrul! Definitely a repeat restaurant
4
Expensive meal for a beer, hamburger and fries. However it is worth it as the burgers were great with a perfect view of the light show from the Marina Bay Sands after dark.
4
Awesome view of the MBS from here and great and friendly service from the crew at overeasy! keep it up!
5
Lovely hamburgers and really good service from the waitress Riza. Always happy and always service minded.
5
Had a splendid dinner. Outside seating areas are the best with the view of the Marina Bay Sands & It's surrounding. Best to make a reservation.
5
As a Friend and I took a seat in the smoking area, within a blink of an eye, a waiter appeared in front of us with with a loud HI IM JOHN! and the menus. (it was about 9.45pm. How was he still so energetic?) The atmosphere and scenery was so nice. Anyhow, We were torn between the varieties offered so we asked John for some recommendations as he was clearing a table beside us. He then asked us what was our preference, like if we wanted dinner or snacks and drinks. Dinner it was and so he proceeded to go through the menus with us like we were ordering a 4 course meal. Started with the starters, we decided on the Buffalo Wings level 3, for the mains I asked about the burgers as I saw that almost every other table had one on it. He said his personal favourite was the Truffle burger so I went for that and he mentioned another of the best selling items was the Spicy Linguini so my friend ordered that. He proceeded to ask if we wanted to have a soup before our meal and asked us to try the mushroom soup and somehow or rather he managed to convince us and we did. As for drinks, I was driving so i ordered a coke but he said " you come here and drink coke ah?? Try our Homemade lemonade with mint la. Same price and something you hardly find outside." So i ordered it. My friend wanted a cocktail and he recommended the Strawberry Mojito for her and she took it. The food was so so so good and till today I am still craving for more of The Truffle Burger. In between the meal, John came over to ask if everything was fine and if we needed anything else, changed our astray and helped to clear the tissues we had lying around the table. (The level 3 wings were HOT!) So we had our meal and sat there for about half an hour and decided to leave. The bill was brought to us by a waiter in black (his face looked so gloomy) so we paid and as we stood up, we heard a loud THANK YOU LADIES! SEE YOU SOON! Turned around to see John carrying some glasses in one hand and waving bye to us with the other.John's enthusiasm and knowledge of the menu made our first experience in Overeasy an unforgettable one. I will definitely be back soon. HUGE KUDOS TO JOHN FOR THE EXCELLENT SERVICE, BRILLIANT RECOMMENDATIONS AND WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE WE HAD. This is what Fnb should be all about and he portrayed it perfectly.To the readers, if you do head down to Overeasy and its your first time there, do look for John as I am sure he will make your night an unforgettable one.Gabriella Tang

Beautiful view , positive vibes , good ambience. Excellent service provided. There's a kind of personal touch with the friendly staff at Overeasy. The food were delicious. Would definitely recommend friends over for a nice evening out. Casual evening spent together in a very elegant atmosphere. Enjoyable time. Music is good. Riza was really helpful when attending to us. Nigel is friendly , good at suggestions and very attentive to us. It has become a habit of coming back to Overeasy again and again

Singapore is the place for nightlife but OverEasy stand stands out amount many waterfront bars. It is hard to decide what is more impressive: the view, delicious cocktails, extensive menu or attention to detail displayed by our main man extraordinaire Alexander. He made our night one to remember. We could not have felt more welcome in our own homes. Not to be missed!

Visited this place for a friend's birthday. Received a call beforehand to confirm my reservation, however staff was impatient on the phone. Wanted to check if they provide any complimentary birthday cake but she hung up on me right after confirming my reservation. Probably busy so I called them back. At the place, our drinks orders were messed up even after 2-3 staffs repeatedly confirmed our order, waiting time was very long. Birthday cake wasn't served until one of us walked over to ask. By the time we were already done with our food and drinks. Overall unattentive and impatient service. Good scenery though and average food.

Just having a happy hour with guests from Australia. Excellent beer and onion rings. Nice outdoor view of marina sand hotel and the bay.

Me and my friend want a place where we can enjoy while we eat our dinner. Food is great we love their burger. The place we can hang out with friends. Floriza and Erica is very attentive and friendly. Very good service...
5
A very nice place to hang out, good view,delicious food and excellent service from erica,very attentive and nice to every customer that dine in this restaurant. I will definitely come back to this restaurant.

I have been here twice and the food was okay.But I experienced the most atrocious service ever during my recent visit.It was during a non-peak hour and the restaurant was practically empty, (to be exact, two couples sitting in the booth seats, one couple sitting at a 4-seater table, and another couple at a 2-seater table at the indoor space) and so, me and my friend asked if we could have a 4-seater table. They said no, because they were for four people. And when we politely asked "then how come the other couples could sit at a 4pax table?", the trainee told us that the couples sitting in the booth seats made reservations and the couple sitting at the 4-seater table was waiting for 2 other members of their family to join them.One of the couples in the booth seats were an elderly couple, and they looked like tourists. Do you think they would have made a reservation at 4-5pm for a meal? I highly doubt it. Also, the couple at the 4-seater table asked for the bill shortly after, and when I checked with them, it was apparently just two of them and they were not waiting for any so-called family to join them. We checked again with the trainee who claimed the manager told her so, but when the manager came over, she denied it, and even said "Ok if you want the 4-seater table, we give you"If there is a rule that 2 people cannot sit at a 4pax table, just feel free to say so. Asking us to move to a smaller table once a crowd comes in is fine too. No customer will accept such ridiculous lies and excuses made up on the spot. Furthermore, your restaurant was almost empty. Ridiculous service where we felt that we were being looked down on (maybe because we were Singaporeans, not rich tourists) and I will never go back no matter no matter how good the view is
5
Been coming here more than 5 yrs...and never regretted a single experience! The next experience is always better than the last!!Nigel, Floriza, Elsie, Raj you guys define this place!! Your heart draws us again and again and will keep drawing us. Thank you for the amazing memories!

my overall experience at overeasy was great, with it's cooling alfresco area for dining and drinks and its juicy burgers were great. However, the only problem I had was when I dined there, me and my bf was put at a table in the centre of the platform and not at the booth seat (which i did request for) but was not notified that the booth seat was only for 4 or more people. As I got there, I asked for a switch of seats but one of your colleagues, in a pink dress, said that I could not switch seats and that it was in their terms and conditions. I bit my tongue.Closer towards midnight, i went in to the restroom and I saw a couple seated at the booth seat, which puzzled me and I was not very happy about it. A kind courtesy to call and inform would be nice and an overall standard of service would be a kind gesture. But saying that, the food and drinks was great. :)

I was at OverEasy with girlfriend for a couple of drinks on 25th April 2015.Upon asking for recommendations, the bar supervisor, Ms Diana, deligently asked for our prefer choice of taste we seek. She then introduced a drink of cosmopolitant for the lady and an old fashion bullet for myself.As i was having my drinks on the bartop, i was served by the bartenders, Ms denise and Mr WeiRong.Ms Denise kindly asked how my old fashion tasted, and i replied bluntly that it tasted like whisky water. Immediately, Ms Denise took my glass and Mr WeiRong replaced another glass for me without hesitant even though I did not request for one.I would just like to praise such effort from the bar crew who did an excellent service without being prompted. Good Job OverEasy

Working at the Affordable Art Fair in the nearby F1 pit building, we decided to grab a drink and a bit to eat after a 12 hour working day. The location is fantastic. The exterior air conditioning a boon too. We were seated without issue and menus arrived promptly.As it was after 22:00, only a midnight munchies menu was offered. I selected the chicken BLT burger whilst my colleague picked the fries with chilli beef. For drinks, we chose one coach tail and two beers.The food was served reasonably quickly. The portion sizes and the food quality were decent. Service then started to deteriorate. It took ages to get the bill and pay. We must have waited twenty minutes for a receipt (required for an expenses claim).At SGD105, this is the most expensive meal I've had whilst in Singapore. I consider this excessive compared to the superior food I've eaten elsewhere

Went down to Overeasy last weekend with Business partner for some drinks and bites. Was quite shocked about the bustling crowd but a lady assistant named "Debbie", if I remember correctly, went out of her troubles to get an table for us.The staff had excellent knowledge about their food and drinks products and advise accordingly, I was quite impressed with how they were able to recommend the best combinations. The assistant Debbie was quite attentive to our needs. She was actually quite smart, she kind of pick up that this was a Business-focused meet and my partners were foreigners who are new to Singapore. She made small talks with my business partners to lighten the mood.Overall I felt the Food was really not bad, the drinks was alright as it was just beers and cocktails but I like how their service went beyond the usual.I recommend everyone to visit! Great scenery too
3
We sat in this restaurant attracted by the stunning views of the Marina Sands Hotel at night. It is nice to have dinner while enjoying the ligh performance from the hotel. I found this place with reasonable food, which was good but overpriced.It is the typical place where you pay more for the views/environment than the actual food
4
Good place to hang out to after a long day of work. Good buffalo wings and truffle fries. Excellent service delivered by Erica Cherry, all smiles and very attentive. Will be back for more!
4
Nice place to chill and unwind especially during late afternoon when the bear is on happy hour promotion and the atmosphere during sunset is just so relaxing. Finger foods are quite nice. Definitely the place if you're looking to have a good deal on beer during happy hour
5
2nd time at Overeasy and 2nd time happy. We went for dinner with some friends, ordered a bunch of burgers and sides and enjoyed the Marina bay light show. The door hostess in a pink dress was extremely helpful and took great care of us and all the guests in our area. Definitely worth trying this place out 
5
Back again to Overeasy, this is now our office best after work beer watering hole. Happy hour deal is until 8pm but if you are paying with UOB credit card, it will give extension of half and hour. What we really like here are few things, the 1-4-1 drinks deal, the scenery and the friendly waiting staffs. Their manager Amos and Jung always come to our table chit chat with us, also to find out their food and drinks standard for the night. Both of them are excellent hosts, people who cares about your experience. These guys really treat everyone like VIP, which is hard to find in Singapore. One more thing, I always like to ask Amos for advice on wine, he is a humble expert. So you know who to look for free wine advice.Thank you Amos and Jung for always be there for us
2
Mini burgers are not as delicious anymore. Truffle fries were too soggy. Burnt! My friends and I were disappointed. It used to be nicer
4
A nice place to hang out with friends this is my 2nd time to bring my friends and food is good and the staff are friendly especially Erica who assist us which is very genuine in her smile.
5
My husband took me here for a meal and then we met friends to watch the Chinese New Year fireworks. Our waitress Riza looked after us very well, so friendly, polite and attentive, made us feel special and made my first night in Singapore a very memorable one, Thank you Riza, I hope to visit again
3
Okay, I get that the view is the main attraction, and it is that view that keeps this from being a two star review. Had the sliders which were quite tasteless. Also, since it was happy hour they brought me two draft beers, even I told them please don't as I can't drink both. Plus, music was quite repetitive and annoying. If you want background music, turn it down. If you want to pump up the volume, make it something worth listening to.
5
Have been here a couple of times now, great for watching the laser show and the fireworks, was there for Chinese new year. Food is good and service we found very good, especially Riza, she is a , helpful and always making sure everything is OK

This diner has an enviable location near the Fullerton Bay hotel, and Merlion park and the outside seating has a great view over the bay.An American style diner menu seemed like a good idea at the time (basically ... Menu=burgers ... a little bit limited, but in line with what we expected).The food was ok - certainly nothing special, and a little disappointing at the price (pricing I think is a lot to do with location).But a couple of things put us off about the visit: firstly, they wanted us to open a tab or pay upfront for the food and drinks -- most odd. And then although our starter came very quickly (good), the problem was that our main course came almost instantly thereafter before we'd had a chance to get into our nachos ( the nachos were also totally plain with rather small portions of dip - not very exciting).Our burgers were certainly acceptable but we weren't impressed by the staff or the whole feel of the place. That was certainly our first and last visit
4
This continues to be the favourite haunt.. be it a quick drinking session or celebration. This place tops my preference for food n service!
3
Great Location overlooking the bay. Lovely American Diner food just the way you'd get it Stateside. Lazy, disinterested, unmotivated staff? Of course. I've never seen as many hands raised by customers requesting attention from the waiting staff in all my travels. Hire more staff and hire better staff. Ridiculous that you can't get the simple thing right.
4
If you're looking for a good spot to unwind on a breezy afternoon, this is a great spot.Consider these:> a good view of the water and the architectural wonders of Singapore, of the sunset that gets reflected on the towers of MBS at 7pm thereabouts, and of the light and sound show an hour later > an option to dine/drink al fresco or the air conditioned indoors> with a UOB card, drinks go one for one!> toilets a few steps away for when the drinks kick in and your wearing stilettos!> reasonably priced food (if you want cheap, go to Lau Pa Sat)> great service especially if you ask for Riza!> oh, a tiny treat if you're celebrating your birthday : )Thanks for the good time, Riza and Overeasy
2
Was very excited to come here for a meal after only having drinks in the past. Awesome location with a great view and a good reputation for a decent burger. And the good was certainly good, but the pain of the service, the untrained staff, the fact that I had to personally get out of my seat to find someone to get me a menu, that answer a question from the menu, the hear me order over the noise means I would never come here again. It's quite unbelievable actually. I would definitely choose somewhere else around this area. There are lots of great places it seems. This is just not one of them,
5
At first we know we will be in Sentosa famous tourist spot in Singapore but when my friend and I stop by at Merlion and took some picture.. We end up enjoying Happy hour drink in Overeasy.. The price of drink is considerable and to think that the place this nice facing the famous all over the world Marina bay Sands can have a good deal promo of drinks.the manager of the outlet Amos is in touch of accommodating lot of guest including us regardless we are not regular comers as they know we are just visiting here for few days..we appreciate the service crew who always drop us and check on us.. Many things to appreciate in coming back to Singapore to visit nice places but there will be reason for us to come back here in overeasy..The next day we went to Sentis
1
Made the reservation via Chope and went to the restaurant.The supervisor who was in charge was totally unfriendly. When I asked for the lunch set menu (which was offered when I made the online reservation), she insisted that lunch set menus are only available unless I'm a guest at Fullerton. There was definitely no other lunch menus. However, after I retrieved the menu from my online reservation, she printed out the same menu that I had. So did that slip her mind? She didn't want to check? Or? Worst of all, she did not make an offer to apologise for the mistake.The food wasn't great and I'm sure I won't go back there for their lunch menus
5
From my own research, I found that Singapore has many excellent venues from which you can see the New Year's Eve fireworks, but most have a high cover charge that includes food but NOT alcohol, which is astronomically priced. Overeasy is an exception: here you merely have a minimum spending requirement per person, and if you choose the special platter/champagne option, you can enjoy the night without having to mortgage the ranch (with a second bottle of champagne and some additional desserts, our total bill--including service charge--was $330usd)And then there's Overeasy's superb location on the water, as well as its attentive, quick, but not overly fawning, service. Don't know if we just got lucky, but our experience was especially enjoyable thanks to the diverse nationalities surrounding our table: a large Indonesian family on one side, a couple from London and a couple from Myanmar on two other sides, and a lovely young local couple behind us. Add the spectacular fireworks show, and we had a memorable New Year's Eve at Overeasy
5
Didnt eat here, so can't personally comment on the food, but my friends inform me it's decentI came here to chill and catch up with friends over a few cocktails and beersGreat setting at the bay with awesome view of the superb Singapore skyline - the high rises of the CBD, the spectacular Marina Bay Sands Hotel, the Esplanade theatre and the Flyer - all within great line sightThe service is quick, friendly and the staff always seem to be alert and attentive and typically attractive bunch too!I really should come here more ofte

Joined colleagues for a Friday night drinks at Overeasy. The place was filled with people when we got there, due to no reservation we were put into the waiting list. The bubbly host invited us to sit by the bar while waiting for our table and meanwhile enjoy the happy hour drinks. Not long we were given a table, but it happen to be at the smoking section, by the way we are non-smokers. A table is better than none. Not long, a manager was going around checking, I think he knew we were uncomfortable. I told him actually we would prefer a non-smoking table. He apologies for the arrangement and he told us to wait for awhile. Minutes later, he came back and invited us to a new table in the non-smoking zone. The new arrangement was great, the view of the basin with the backdrop of Marina Bay Sands was beautiful. We are really enjoying ourselves at the new table with fresh air. The waiting staffs are attentive and quick to serve all our orders. We even managed to watch the laser show. It is truly a great experience after a long week. Our colleagues will come back for more. Best venue for a Friday wind down.

I was so disappointed with my burgers. The TRUFFLE BURGER and BIG BLUE BURGER were just sloppy, soggy messes. The beef patties were bland. I ordered medium for my truffle burger but it turned out to be under cooked (i did not return because of the long waiting time). The fries were obviously not cooked to order as it was cold and hard with no seasoning.And for the happy hour drinks: If you were to order 2 glasses of beer, they'll just serve them all at once. They do not allow saving your drinks to be served later for their happy hour promo. Yeah. Now you can enjoy your warm drinks or get drunk.OVERRATED
5
We went there and got a really nice food, and saw the awsome light show of Marina Bay Sans, smoking and drinking! Unforgetable night!
5
It was my 4th time to Overeasy in the last one year and again just there over the weekend with one of my buddy... I noticed something different on the menu and then I realised it has been revamped! Decided to order a few new items & give it a try...wow! I m kinda impressed. All these while, I m into Overeasy for its view rather than the food but now I have to say I will be back for the latter!! Go for the truffle burger and buffalo wings...you won't go wrong! ~ops, the plating was too tempting that I forgotten to take pictures of what I ordered
5
Earlier in Dec 2014, I made an online reservation online for a Christmas year end party at Overeasy..but I had to raincheck...hence I had to cancel...However things worked out in the end and I had showed up at overeasy and I was greeted by Riza n I told her my situation.. She could immediately understand n she went above n beyond in ensuring my experience is not compromised.. She took full ownership n validated with her manager n got me seats after doing some minor tweaking. She is a fine example of the reputation of Overeasy
4
Overlooking MBS laser show from 8pm onwards nightly. Though not a spectacular show, I do enjoy my dinner with beautiful river views. Would be better to sit in the open air, if it's not raining, for a cooling night and cozy ambience. The burgers, truffle fries and buffalo wings were great. Also due to credit card promotion, we had 1 for 1 drinks from 7-10pm. The staff that served us was friendly and accommodating
5
The bar is my fav spot in Overeasy. With a friendly Bar Manager, Siew on the helm, the crew goes into details like auto ice water and clearing of serviettes. Small details like this really shows that they care about their bar and customers. Occasionally, you get to see the Chef tapping beer too. I really enjoyed watching Siew doing his cocktails, very professional. The managers never failed to greet and have a chit chat with me, no matter how busy. They used to play better music, but it's lacking the kick recently. Definitely recommended for after hour drinks. As an architect designer, I can safely say that the interior is one of best bar in Singapore. Hopefully overeasy can have a variety if cheese on their menu
5
Was there last night and truly love the vibe and energy. Great venue for beers and had their daily special- Angle hair pasta which is very good. Service wise, I was well taken care by the team that is so efficient. Service seamless and professional! Kudos to the team for a fast pace venue. Location is great and has great view of Marina Bay Sands
5
Had the angel hair pasta.. Absolutely fabulous! Sat al fresco and had such a great unblocked view of the Marina bay sands light laser show. The waffles was soft and fluffy! The donut with fudge dip was so good I cannot stop at one! The service was excellent! The manager was very attentive professional and often checked on us, Amos, and gave us great food recommendations.
5
Came over with my partner for dinner today. Was ushered in upon arrival, and quickly showed to our tables. Within minutes, was attended by the very polite waitress and she recommended us the special for the night. We had a burger each and shared the truffle Mac and cheese which I would highly recommend. Overall, great dining experience and of course great view of the daily water show from the Singapore river
5
Enjoyable night, good food, excellent service. They politely asked us to swap tables and we were happy to! They continued to be super nice and took very good care of us. The manager came personally to show his appreciation. Good view and music. Have to visit during your stay in Singapore

I was very excited to visit this bar due to the great reviews I’ve been hearing from a couple of friends. Alas, when I arrived – I was dismayed because they insisted they did not have a reservation under my name. They had given my table to another person with the same name, but I was shocked because I don’t have a common name . But that was fine – what I found rather trying was that the server was incredibly rude and not apologetic at all. The food was not too bad – I had the grilled cheese sandwich which was really quite yummy. But throughout the night, waiters kept bugging my table to move to a smaller table so that they could accommodate a larger group of folks. I was part of a group of 4, but they wanted to move us to another table, so they could squeeze in a group of 6 to my table instead. I didn’t really feel welcomed here at all. I even requested to speak to their general manager, amos or adam was his name. But he was so busy that he came by, said sorry and left so quickly. I felt that it was so insincere! So I’m really quite unsure if I will ever go back
5
The View was so amazing I went back the very next day. Great place to watch the Marina Bay Sands laser show. Food is good but the view makes the food taste average. Great place to just sit with a drink.
2
I was there with couple of friends who were really excited to visit this place. However, it turned up to be disappointed since the service was really poor. The waitresses were unfriendly. They were also seem not to know what's in the menu and at the same time forgot about our order without apologizing. The only good thing about this place is that the view to MBS which kinda beatiful.
5
Went for a late dinner. This place is next to the famous merlion and opposite Marina Bay Sands. Outdoor seating was nice with a view of the water. Food was great - Had the To Die For burger and the spicy buffalo wings (crazy mofo - yum!) Wanted to try their waffles too but too bad they don't have that on their supper menu
5
My friend Loan forgot her bag in the toilet of this restaurant.and evetually one of the staff found it and give it back.. the manager name Amos..Best experience I ever had!unexpectedly that someone gave that much concern for costumers..friendly staff.food is impressive and atmospher is amazing. I"ll come back this place as soon as possible
4
We came here for dinner and met floriza. The food was great as well as the view. But the best part was the service by floriza who was attentive and really helpful. She made our night that much more memorable.
3
Very disappointing that the salad comes with old brown lettuce which ruined our lunch. So disappointing considering the amazing views. Service was average and certainly didn't know what to do with our complaint but fully charged and had the cheek to charge a service charge as well
3
Sure, this place gives you a nice view of Marina Bay but I wasn't impressed with the price of alcohol and the small servings of food for the money.....But a traveller is well aware of that before setting foot into such a place....therefore you can't complain. But one strange thing, which I have never encountered before, was that they wanted to hold onto my credit card when I first ordered....for THEIR security I was told ( must have had some runners). I said no way and said I would leave.......then it wasn't an issue. But I noticed other people handing over credit cards...foolish 
4
A fantastic spot to watch the laser light show at Marina Bay. Good choice of "American" style cafe food, great drinks menu and happy hour prices. The staff were excellent, our waiter told us with just seconds to spare the happy hour food and bev specials...very helpful would come here agai
4
Good food (if you like American), good service, and the location cannot be beaten, particularly when the laser show from Marina Bay Sands gets going around 9pm. Only minor drawback is the pricing (but, hey, it's Singapore). Great place to take guests to give them a sense of Singapore at night
3
Scenic view of the marina bay area. Sit outdoors and you can catch the laser show from Marina Bay Sands at 8pm or 10pm. However, you know the high humidity here so unless you are dressed light and does not feel hot after having alcohol, do try.Always crowded and packed with office folks after work. It must be the beers going at one-for-one.Reservation is accepted if you commit to $100 per pax. Unless you can drink 10pints in a night (happy hour price) and drink two at one go (they serve both at once and do not keep it cold for you). Guess it is their way of saying "No Reservations" politely. The comfort is mini-burgers are at $1. Yum
5
Nice ambience good service, and attentive waiters. Great place
Great staffs, efficient. Can have more variety of food. However food was still great
3
It's on the Marine Bay with a good view and many outdoor seats. Beer buy 1 free 1 during the happy hour. Service is just so so, in particular refill and bill - you have to chase several times.
4
Beautiful spot overlooking the marina. Food is good and so is the music. I recommend the club sandwich!
4
I the experience is great with attentive servers and mouthwatering dishes. And also the view is fantastic.
5
Excellent - service was 100% on point, the food was fresh and delicious. The price was reasonable for the area and the offers for a Happy Hour drinks were welcome. We'll definitely be back.
3
For a restaurant that is in a prime location with decent skyline views; Overeasy has rested on its laurels.Whilst the food is generally good - I can recommend the Malt Shakes and Burgers - the overall attendance and well being of the restaurant is lacking; from no soap in the bathrooms, to leaking air-con units; to lack of cutlery on the table and the staff that group together chatting, when you are trying to get their attention. It's these tiny things that niggle away at what would normally be a perfectly acceptable american-diner experience; and turn it into a dissatisfying one; where you felt that you have overpaid
2
We arrived at the restaurant on Saturday evening fully aware that as it was the rehearsal for National day and therefore would be fully booked. I think that someone forgot to tell the Chef and Restaurant manager this. On a very busy day I was astounded by the number of items missing from the menu as well as a number of affordable white wines. Really!!!! There is simply no excuse for having so many basic things missing. Pure incompetence by the senior staff. The food was pretty average but very Singaporean in as much as it was expensive. Surely we should actually now say enough is enough. We continue to pay high prices here in Singapore for very average food. Overeasy is no different. I ordered some truffle fries, they never arrived, I chased again 40 mins later they still never arrived. Were they on the bill at the end of the evening????Of course they were. The waiting staff worked extremely hard throughout the evening but I don't think they had enough staff on for the number of customers. Overall, Overeasy is an experience I wont repeat. If you have booked for National day, my advice, eat at home and save your money its simply not worth it
1
We went to OverEasy the 11th of July. We’d been there before for a drink and really enjoyed the view. My partner had a work colleague in town so we decided to take her there for dinner.We arrived at 7:30 pm. Their automatic check-in system told us it was a 15 - 30 minute wait for 3 people so we put our name in.It was raining so they had closed down the outside section. The problems started when after an hour we hadn’t been seated and when I checked with them there were more than a dozen groups in front of us.It had stopped raining 20 - 30 minutes ago. A few of us asked them if we could sit outside and they told us they couldn’t open it up, “Because they didn’t have enough man power.” If they don’t have enough "man power” to service the outdoor area, I’m not sure why it was open when we arrived before the rain. My best guess is they didn’t want to open the outdoor area up as it would mean more work to pack up later.After waiting so long we eventually gave in and crammed ourselves with another group in the small covered area outside. We could barely hear each other due to loud groups being all around us and had to put up with cigarette smoke as well.The food, the view and the service once we were seated was quite good; but we were quite disappointed we weren’t able to sit in the main outdoor area due to what seemed like the laziness of the staff. The management either needs to higher more staff or staff that wants to do their job properly. They should also consider covering the main outdoor area so rain (Which isn’t exactly rare in Singapore) doesn’t put their guests in this situation

So I went here for the burger. I ordered The Double Trouble Burger and Jagerbomb to fill my tummy. It was late at night, Saturday Night, and I enjoyed the moment so much. The Burger tasted yuuummmy and the Jagerbomb, well, it's Jagerbomb. They served various meals, snacks, and beverages but still, I'd recommend the Burgers. Also, I love the cool atmosphere since Overeasy is located in One Fullerton so we could eat, chat, drink and observed the view of Singapore at night. It's really beautiful. Definitely one of the best hang out places in town
3
Meeting friends to watch the fireworks on Saturday night. Great location. Food good. Trendy people. So this place should tick all the boxes. But the service was appalling. We had to chase for everything. Order was incorrect. Thankfully the company and the view made up for it.
5
Awesome restaurant. Mr Siwa was really nice and funny. Coming from Germany I have special demands and he fulfills every single wish. Next time I will define toy come back to overeasy! Awesome atmosphere and beautiful view on the river
4
OverEasy is a high-end bar, restaurant located at probably one of the best spots in Singapore if you want to have a view of the magnificent Marina Beach Sands hotel & Casino and the rest of the iconic view of Singapore. It has a nice modern feel to it and they play good music, especially if you are into classics from the last 20 years.Many of the good seats will be reserved but the place has also a quite good ambiance inside in the evenings. Let it be said straight away it is an expensive place to hangout and have a beer and if you want more than a couple you are better off going another place if you are not packed with money. In the early evening there are some discounts but they disappears. A Kirin cost 15+tax SG$ - in all 17,66 SG$, and that is a pretty steep price; it is even more than you pay at CafÃ© de Hotel de Ville in Paris for a beer

If you're looking for a real sense of place and easy eating looking right on SIngapore's latest skyline, Overeasy could be just that. Great for a casual night with friends, outdoor dining, cold beers and cocktails. Reasonable food - not fine dining but just what you'd expect from the name - great burgers, fries, nachos, etc etc. The setting, right on the water, is unforgettable and staff were friendly and fun. I won't give the game away but the 'show' that plays out in front of you on full moon night is incredible
5
I am a customer of Overeasy for a number of times and always love the ambiance and their good food, especially the Classic Mac and Cheese! On top of these, as all of us know that what makes a service-based business is also the people besides a good product. Overeasy has very attentive staff who will contribute towards your satisfaction of the dining and chilling experience to the fullest! ;)And I would like to specially thank Lee, one of the friendly and attentive waitress for giving her best service throughout my entire dining experience here
3
Serene is very friendly and smiley. We are also very impressed with the setting and the promotions. Sliders are a MUST TRY!!! Most of the staff are eager to serve. You get unobstructed view of the MBS and it's definitely a place to chill out after a long day at work
3
Firstly, they no longer take reservation. Even with 13 people, which i think is not very nice as it is hard for big groups to get a table and they have so many big tables in the place. Secondly, they waitress are quite confused with our orders and some of the orders we made was not delivered. The waitress was not apologetic and just asked us if it is fine to cancel the order.The food is good but the service should be improve for people to return
5
This is our 1st visit and Overeasy is just spot-on. The food and drinks was above our expectation, and the service staffs were fabulous. Elsie gave us her recommendation and it just score full marks. The Mac and Cheek is simply delicious together with the daredevil spicy wing, we got sweaty after 2nd wings. We had a couple of cocktails, I must admit they have raised the bar, it is out of the box. Love the aloha lady, or maybe I'm just a green-tea dude. The spike milk shake is also interesting another drink that we will come back for more. They are also have the best view for marina bay sands. Got to watch the laser show at the grand stand.Yes, we are coming back and bringing more folks along
5
Enjoyed a burger with my husband on a Saturday night at 22:00. Appreciate the late opening hours (particularly for food), quick and efficient service and good draft beer (erdinger).Would benefit from perhaps another vegetarian burger option other than an unoriginal Portobello mushroom burger - though realise this is obviously more geared towards a full on meat-eater. Nonetheless thoroughly enjoyed the place and would definitely come back
5
On the recommendation of a friend we went to have dinner at this place after some sightseeing and a long photo shoot session. Walking outside for a while in the heat, we opted for the in-house dining instead of the outside patio.Menu was ok, not much choice but we found what we wanted. burgers!! Ordered our medium-rare beef burgers and were shocked at how fast they arrived... Seems like it wasn't even 5 minutes. okay, we thought the meat patties were going to be undercooked but they weren't. They pride themselves in making their own buns as well. Burgers were tasty, juicy... We'll everything you would expect from a burger, and then more! Best burger I had in Asia so far. Only downside was that after a while of being inside the restaurant, you realize the music is loud! Had we known about that beforehand, we would have picked a spot outside. Between sweating or having my ears assaulted by loud 70's music, I'd rather sweat a little.But all in all a great experience and will definitely be back for more

Three of us had dinner here on a Saturday night before we headed out for some drinks later in the evening. We happened to arrive just as the light show was starting - it's nice to sit & watch the lights as the fan blows over you sitting outside on the balcony.We started off with a bowl of truffle fries (to share) & some of their fresh squeezed lemonade. Both were good! We did end up ordering a second plate of fries a little later on & sadly they weren't as good. The first lot were crispy, crunchy & perfectly salted with lots of little crispy bits at the bottom of the bowl, the second plate was alright but definitely not anywhere near as good as the first bowl which was a clear indication that we should have just stuck to one bowl! ;)I had the broccoli quinoa salad - it was actually very tasty! The bowl seems quite small but once I had finished the salad I was quite full (it could also have had something to do with all the fries I had already eaten?!). For my taste I would have liked some more salt & pepper but for a hot night this refreshing salad was a good choice.One of my friends had the burger - he enjoyed it! It was quite large & difficult to eat so he opted for a knife & fork, probably not a bad idea in the end.My other friend had the spaghetti with veal meatballs - he also enjoyed it.We finished the night off with two alcoholic beverages; why order beer when for 2 SGD more you can have cocktails?!For all three of us it was about 180SGD, not too bad by Singapore standards really. This place is nothing super special however if you're after a burger & fries or some decent pasta with a view, of course, then this place ticks all the right boxes
3
What can I say drinking is expensive in Singapore, 2 drinks 1 alcohol 1 non $32. The homemade lemonade was very refreshing but pretty bad when you need credit card for a couple coldies.
4
I joined a party of 2 for lunch in this restaurant. The Atmosphere is very relaxed. Service is really good and food is also very good. Prices are fair. A great spot for a quick lunch in Singapore.
5
Just at Riverbank, next to Fullerton, perfect view on Marina Bay Sands. Bankers and lawyers have a couple of beers here after work. Comfortable seats at the river side, next to a smoking area. Very cool evening.
5
Siva and the rest of the staff is incredible! Great place to celebrate your birthday with your friends. Awesome service!

Whether one chooses the air-conditioned interior with warm and comforting hues or the breezy outdoors offering breathtaking views of Marina Bay Sands, Over Easy exudes a unique charm of its own like no other. It is always bustling with after-work crowds and hearty music, allowing its patrons to unwind and totally relax. By night, especially, the laser shows opposite adds enchantment to Over Easy, hence it is good to chill alfresco.We started with their Handcut Haystack Fries with Parmesan & Rosemary - seen many people ordering it. The golden-ness of the fries looked very enticing, and they were very crispy. Sprinkled with rosemary and parmesan cheese, the fries were rather delicious, and good for munching over drinks.Then we also tried their other signature - Cheesesteak Sliders - mini little burgers that were delicious. The sweet bread were crispy and melted in the mouth, the melted cheese an added touch of deliciousness to the very tender, medium rare mini beef patties. It took me 4 to 6 bites to polish one off, nibbling slowly, but I believe there are those who could just pop these bite-size delicacies in one or two mouthfuls.For more detailed information and photos, do feel free to visit::http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/02/chillout-at-over-easy.htm
5
Very relaxed enjoyed a lovely all day breakfast and a few drinks, our waitress always check if we need more drinks being scottish that's a god send. All the staff seem happy and eager to assist great location our waitress Floriza I think who smiles all the time. Definitely visit again
5
The level of attention to detail is unbelievable. The food is excellent and very fast. There's a very good deal on beer buckets and Siva makes sure you feel at home. An absolute must is the cinnamon donuts that go perfectly with coffee. Nothing pretentious about the place. Would definitely come back!
5
Very attentive staff and always smiling no matter how many rounds of ice water they need to served. Most amazingly is the Manager works very closely with the staff in giving service and clearing plates and sweeping the floor. And when she photo-bombed us, Junk (i think thats how its spelled-sorry..cos thats what i heard) treat us a round of drinks..Simply AMAZING attitude!!
5
Been many times,with my son and fiancÃ©,who live in SG.always very nice,staff very helpful,and always on hand,Stunning views of marina bay,the sands,and floating stage.We had a fantastic evening on New Year's Eve,with one of the best views of the fireworks in the bay....Thanks to all for making it a fantastic night.
4
It is a hang out place within the central area. With a perfect view of MBS, a place that truly amazing. Their spicy wings is a must try item with a cold pint of Erdinger. Service wise i could say that all the staff were accommodating especially to Ms. Lei who assisted us that night..thanks for her for giving us the perfect table to enjoyed the dancing light show of MBS..it was truly a place to remember..surely i will come back!
4
This does what it says on the can - good basic burgers, salads and fries. After a few days on Thai only food it was fun to just have a large salad!
4
We started with one drink and then decided on having a few more and cancelling our reservation at another restaurant. Staff were very attentive and we thoroughly enjoyed our time. Great selection of cocktails and nibbles! Thank you!
5
The food was awesome and affordable and the service was fantastic. It was my birthday and they brought out a complimentary cake with all the waiters singing for me. Was fantastic! And very memorable! Thank you Overeasy!
5
Siva service is prompt. Recommendation of food is good and very friendly. The ambience is great. The food varieties are great, especially the spicy wings! Highly recommended for a starter. Overall, it is an enjoyable experience.
4
It's was my first time here. Really loved the view here at night. Choices of food available here is quite limited, but pricing is quite reasonable. The warm double chocolate fudge brownie dessert was superb! Would definitely consider a second time here! :)
5
The interior design n the vibe is e best in singapore which they serve nice erdinger beer with super value pricing during their happy hrs. Excellent service with a wonderful view on spore bund. Fri is e best nice to party hard

I went there on Christmas day 2013 with my family (with 2 young kids) and friends. It's located at One Fullerton (which is along Fullerton Road), restaurant is by the waters. Nearest MRT station is Raffles Place and it is located near the Merlion, a tourist spot. However only the view is touristy, everything else is reasonable including price of food.For best view, sit open-air by the marina reservoir. The sight of open waters by the reservoir blends perfectly with the view of some of the unique architectural sights in Singapore. During evening time (at around 2000hrs), watch the laser show unveil itself forming patterns on the water surface.As the breeze cools you, service staff comes promptly. The menu here is western and is child friendly. My kids have mac and cheese while we had sandwiches and burgers. We also had chicken wings and salads for starters Price is pretty standard, nothing too off the top. Food comes amazingly fast but still prettily arranged on the plate. Portions are just nice and tasty. Fries are a pleasant surprise, there's no greasy taste or soaked in oil feel like those in some fast food restaurants. The entire atmosphere of calmness amidst the buzzing night life makes dinning there another level on its own.If dinning with a girlfriend, one can head up to a dance club located at level two of the same building. Great location for a great date. If you make a booking, staff of the restaurant will send you a SMS indicating that booking is successful. Friendly staff will also call to confirm the booking on the actual day. Overall, it was a perfect symphony of feelings, sight, sound and taste
4
We always enjoy visiting Overeasy - the kids love the Old Fashioned Mac n Cheese, and we love the "To Die For" burger... It's one of the best in Singapore! Make sure you leave room for the warm donut balls and chocolate sauce!Service is always excellent, and you can't beat the view across Marina Bay
5
Best dish that we highly recommend is the Mac & cheese! Totally mouthwatering and worth every penny! They also have giant onion rings imported from panama! Great venue for gathering as crew are very friendly and absolutely wonderful! Special shout out to Siva who always meet us with a smile and makes an effort to know us! We've celebrated 2 birthdays here and we will definately be back for more
5
I visit Overeasy quite regularly with my colleagues and friends. Love the view and the casual vibe it provides as well as some friendly service staff. The food is quite decently priced and their drinks are cheap during happy hour which makes it all the more appealing! We can never get a seat unless we book way in advance!! The staff are quite friendly and helpful especially the manager, Siva who always takes care of his clients and is always willing to go the extra mile
4
The staff are very attentive and gracious with our needs. Not my first time to Over easy! That 's the reason I recommended this place for the gathering.
4
Located across from the Marina Bay sands. Seating is available outside for close viewing if night laser show. Had appetizers and beer. Wings were well flavored and a bit spicy....so tasty

.. And I am writing this review after having being there a few times!1) Quite contrary to its' name, Overeasy is an extremely difficult place, in terms of service, staff, ambience and food- everything! 2) To go more into detail, food-wise, NEVER order the vegetarian "portobello" burger. It presents you rotten mushrooms that will create a havoc on your stomach! Pity if you are a veggie like me.3) Because of this poor portobello experience, the next time around I ordered the broccoli and feta salad. I won't deny that it was actually pretty good and healthy, but so small quantity-wise! Hey, considering that somebody's ordering it as a part of their lunch, it was quite disappointing!4) One time I went there for a working lunch. It was more a noisy lunch than a working one. They had some dumb blender/mixer which was used to make smoothies and shakes. It really brought the house down. The whole one hour they were only making smoothies for God-knows-who because the restaurant was empty during peak lunch hour, and when we called the service staff to kindly shut down the stupid mixer, they said "No sorry LAAAAH, cannot LAAAH!!"Never going back to Over easy
4
Over the past few years, i've tried my best to keep away from the main tourist strips. Thankfully I decided to grab a burger and wings here in Overeasy. I'm a spice addict and tried the hottest wings available.. and for the first time ever.. The hottest wings actually were hot! Decent burger too, but the main attraction for me was wings, which I would return for. Only criticism would be the servers didn't seem interested in my table, I was prepared to order additional food and drinks, but was never approached or asked. About 35 mins after I finished eating, i was approached and asked if I wanted the bill.. Disappointing service
4
The view is pretty cool with Marina Bay Sands in the background. You should definitely consider the monsoon season, as it has been really rainy during the month of December. You would come here for an alfresco night out, hence that should definitely be a consideration
2
Visited with my client. The outdoor seat is good choice looking over Marina, but I noticed so many cons.The broken tables and chairs are left outside. Looked so ugly. The service was slow and I had to walk over to the counter.This place has such nice view outside, but all these things spoiled the experience there
4
Best view of marina bay sands light show. A little bit hot to sit outside but food was great. Especially the burger, cooked to perfection. One particular waitress made the night all that perfect. Didn't manage to catch her name but she has a thick Aussie accent. Thumbs up to her for the great service and recommendation on where to visit in Singapore. Wil definitely visit again
5
We're an expat couple living in Singapore and use OverEasy as one of our favorite "go to" restaurants when we have visitors who want a great casual dining experience with a view. The food is consistently terrific (burgers, steaks, great salads) and Jiang, the manager, has a great crew with a strong customer service orientation.Of special note on the food side, OverEasy has a great promotion - $1 sliders when the Singapore Stock Market closes down. That takes a bit of the sting out of a down market, and the sliders are awesome! A choice of steak tips or chicken - fantastic! They also offer a veggie burger and terrific salads for vegetarians as well as big juicy burgers and very good steaks. Their fries are also to die for. In addition, they offer 2 for 1 beer and wine selections from 5:30 - 7:00 or so. Great deal, as alcohol in Singapore is ridiculously expensive!The location is great too - right opposite the Marina Bay Sands, and great for taking in the Sands' light show every evening!In short, we love OverEasy for either a casual business dinner or hanging out with friends, and applaud Jiang and the whole team for their commitment to great customer service and awesome food!

Brought by my best friend to this place since we almost 5 years nots eeing each other. He said according to his wife in this place you could find the best burger in Singapore! Luckily we could get the best seat outside with Marina Bay Sands as background. The food insanely delicious. Hiwever, the best experinece just being interrupted by a "rush" behaviour of the waiter/waitress who eagerly wanted to clean up our desk. Without ever usking first they just proactively took my plate when i still ate my last bite of burger!! Understand that the restaurant always full and people queuing to have the seat, still it's not an appropriate attitude to show up from my perspective. This just reduce my rating for their service, eventhough since beginning it's flawless..
5
Jang is excellent.We had a hens night for our friend..And she has assisted to create the most exciting, excellent and superbly memorable moment for our friend. Thumbs and toes up for the crews. Manu has been very accommodating and sporting as well..We will definitely recommend the place an come back for the next celebration..
5
Awesome view, excellent service, nice people who have excellent people skills. Been coming here for 5 years and haven't regretted it yet and neither will I. Elsie makes your night with her million $$ smile and warm personality. Nothing beats it!! Keep it up guys!!
5
Great service, amazing view! Perhaps the drinks are slightly pricey but after 5pm is 2-4-1...I didn't eat this time but what I saw looked good.
5
Fantastic view, service and music. Food reasonably priced. Pint of Heineken over £8 though. Excellent staff, go Siva! :)
5
They have one for one happy hours, to better enjoy the sun set on the marina.
Very nice choice of snacks and burgers.
Ask for Laura, the charming waitress.
4
Perfect for after work chill out, conveniently located at the heart of the CBD, with probably the best view on Marina Bay Sands ! If STI is down you get your mini-burgers at 1 SGD, fun !
Nice staff. Highly recommended.
5
Siva is the best server ever. I felt like I had a private table. I've had good experiences here before, but Siva made this place amazing. Highly recommended for weeknight drinks and dinner.
5
One of the best views of the marina bay sands.food was great, as was the service.recommend the donuts and chocolate sauce.
Great spot to have dinner and watch the light show.
5
The service was so personalized. The servers had sincerity in their smile and warmth when welcoming their guests in. Most of them went an extra mile just to ensure their customers have an unforgettable time. Excellent service mixed with the amazing ambience made a trip here such a delight. I would definitely love to come here again. Hats off to the server Mr Alex, who made my birthday such an amazing peaceful and unforgettable time here
4
This is one of our favorite place to come and have a quiet drink and to enjoy the view of Marina Bay. The ambience is great and the crowd is a little more upscale. If you want to avoid the rowdiness of drunken people, this is the place to be. The staff are friendly, easy to get along with and easy on the eye. The drinks are a little steep in price but you are paying for the experience that over easy provides. Overall a great place to visit whilst in Singapor
5
Amazing place, the best view of Marina Bay! Get there around 20:00 and you will be at the best spot for the light show! Happy hour beers, good price for the city! Good staff serving you... highly recommended! Would definitely go back and recommend to anyone
5
If you want a place to relax and have a drinks with your friends, Overeasy is the best place to be! Great service! Great place! Great ambiance! Friendly baristas! Perfect place!
5
nice atmosphere, good food, nice and friendly staffs. good for simply just unwinding or if you want to see the city. i will definitely come back here.
4
The service was quite nice, Singapore Sling and the steak were excellent. A few orders were messed up but the staff was polite and changed everything upon request
4
service was outstanding. the spicy wings was superb. atmosphere was very conducive and great service offered by Alexander. a very wonderful experience indeed.
4
Friendly staffs and beautiful views. We always love this place but it's over priced. 15 dollars for a cola mixer... Food wise is ok only. But the view is amazing. Every Saturday there is fireworks prior to Singapore national day. Ensure u come earlier. :)
5
The food at Overeasy appears simple, but the food’s savor has remarkable depth. The restaurant is both clean and orderly—despite having a lot of customers at a time—and all the staff members there greeted my companions and me with smiles as warm as the specialties they serve there. I would like to commend Ms. Lei of Overeasy who gave us a first-rate service during our stay. I would thoroughly recommend Overeasy to anyone who wants to relax and have a good quality taste of food while having the best view in Singapore, Marina Bay Sands. I know I'll certainly be returning soon
2
We enjoyed our food but were very disappointed with portion size. The menu says "large plates" so bc it was so expensive, we decided to order one dish and split it and then order Mac n cheese for our daughter. The sea bass was hardly big enough for one person! We had to order another Mac n cheese bc we were still hungry. We should've just left and gotten food elsewhere. The beer was really expensive...somewhere around $15SGD each. We spent $90SGD on 2 beers, 2 Mac n cheese and one entree. Insane! Be careful when dining inside as part of the floor (to the right) is elevated with no warning....we watched 2 people trip on this step in the 30 mins we were there. Nice views from the restaurant but stay away....overpriced!!
1
There is absolutely nothing enjoyable about this restaurant, except the view on the marina bay. Bad food, bad service, completely overprised. The music was so loud that we had to yell at each other. The table next to us was so close that we basically shared the table with another couple. Instead of a warm greeting they ask you for your credit card as deposit the moment you arrive... in case you secretly run away without paying?! Never experienced anything like this before.
2
As i happen to live in Singapore and people like the location of this place, i have to go there from time to time. Honestly, other than the view.. there is nothing else that is enjoyable. Yesterday i ordered a glass of wine and a burger. It only took 1.5 hours and about 10 complains. I don't know what else to say...loud and crowded..many other places to visit.
3
The view from the seats is nice, even though the seats and the venue need better cleaning techniques. The venue is in need of a refurbishment, especially the toilets. The staff are nice but not overly attentive. The prices are OK, not great choices but just enough that everyone got something they wanted.
4
Set lunches are great value-for-money and comes with a salad, main and coffee/tea. The food are nicely done and service is good for lunch time (not too much crowd).
3
Had pre dinner drinks for 6.Wanted an outdoor area to capture the view. There was a light drizzle and wait staff did not allow us to order and stand outside. Went bar side. Great drinks. Was told its 1-1 but later was told when asking for 2 drink that our drinks did not qualify. Did not kick up a fuss as it was business drinks and let it go.Overall- nice setting. Mediocre service. Great views. Thats all
3
The view of the Marina Bay sands is spectacular. Ordered the "to die for burger" and it was worth it. tacos and dips go well with Erdinger at a competitive price. However, inquire on the beer menu as menu says pint but they only have bottles which is more expensive than a pint.All in all, a fab place to hang out after work
3
Go here quite often for drinks after work - always busy and a good atmosphere, lovely view over marina bay. Food is ok but nothing to rave about, happy hour house wine is 1-1. Service is REALLY slow so order well in advance of the end of happy hour at 8pm and head elsewhere for food
3
Been there yesterday, the view is great and we were lucky that the Weather God made it even better. .. Lovely atmosphere, ad well. .. don't expect to much when it comes to food as the choices are too limited and even not worth mentioning. They have great offers on the drinks menu. . Go there to have few drinks and recharge, while you enjoy the great view of the Singapore sky line and Marina Bay. .

Planned a birthday gathering with approximately 12 people, and we made the efforts of calling in to make a reservation *one week* before the actual event date. So we made the reservation, and was promised a dining table. On the night of the event, we showed up 15 minutes before the reservation time, and was informed on the spot that "our seatings are limited due to weather conditions (aka light rain), the outdoor section is closed." As a result, our entire group got a bar lounge meant for 6-8 people, shafted in the corner with very little air-conditioning. Not trying to be difficult customers or anything, but we did specify that we would be dining and drinking when the reservation was made! So I informed the waitress that the arrangement for our group was unacceptable....while it may not have been her fault, all that she could promise was "maybe we will switch you to a better table when someone else leaves". Lesson learnt from this experience: 1.) Reservations are useless, the moment they hang up on your they forgot about what you requested 2.) Aside from the decent view of Marina Bay Sands, the actual setting of this restaurant is not even remotely CLOSE to our expectations based on price levels: very little to no air-conditioning whatsoever, unfitting choice of music (beats and trance music with strong beats, and the amp just so happened to be right next to the bar lounge assigned for us. 3.) the overall attitude exhibited by the servers seemed to indicate that they would rather be anywhere but stationed at work. Solution: Our group decided to leave prior to ordering, and spend money somewhere else instead. We ended up going to Lau Pa Sat (about 10 minutes walk from Merlion Park), it ended up being a very unique birthday gathering, authentic Singaporean experience with great food, at much lower prices. Bottom line: Take your money somewhere else, for you will get better bang for your buck, more courteous service manners, and most importantly: reservations that you can trust and count on! Tons of options around One Fullerton itself, if not you can always walk to Boat Quay or Clarke Quay located 10-15 minutes away
2
This would be a lovely bar from which to watch the Marina Bay Sands Light Show were it not for the appalling service. Similar to other reviews a party of 4 of us went to this bar, we ordered 2 beers and 2 glasses and wine and had to wait for 30 minutes! Staff were totally unorganised and disinterested. Apart from the location I would not advise visiting this bar - the service is so bad they don't deserve customers
2
I've been to Overeasy many times and have even organised a company function there.The place was really promising when it started i.e. great view and location, nice relax vibe and a decent enough food and bar menu, albeit not the best value for money.I went back again for lunch really recently. To say that the staff was less than enthusiastic is an understatement. The food was insipid - don't bother with the grilled chicken salad or the linguine aglio olio, really.There better places to waste your time and money at
5
This is a wonderful pub, with really atmospheric outdoor seating overlooking Marina Bay Sands. The food was average, this place is best because of the wonderful location and ambience and to enjoy drinks with friends. If you go at the right time, you can also see the laser show every night from the pub. The service wasnt great. Just as a waiter put down my drink, my hand toppled the glass and the drink fell out. I was rudely and flatly told that they can not replace my drink. While that is valid, there is a better way to put it across and empathize with customers
5
Get yourself a cocktail and sit back at night and take in the amazing sight of the Marina Bay Sands, Merlion and waterfront. Drinks are less than $20, sit on the outdoor lounges and soak it up! They stay open til 3am and play a great mix of 80s music
