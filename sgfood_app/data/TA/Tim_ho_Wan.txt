All the tim sum dishes were very good. The signature baked barbecue pork bun is tasty. Deserved its Michelin starred rating

It was my first time to eat at Tim Ho Wan in Singapore and they say it’s the most affordable Michelin star restaurant. The food is superb! Simple, quick, minimalist and just satisfies your soul. The servers aren’t so friendly though. But whenever I see a branch in Asia, I try to eat there all the time to get my hands on those sweet pork buns that makes you wanna say... get in my belly!!! Yum!

Since Tim Ho Wan opened in Singapore, it became my favourite place for Dim Sum. The taste is excellent for my tongue (even some Hongkonger might argue differently) and the price is reasonable, less than what you spend if you go to those famous Chinese Restaurant chains that serve Dim Sum as part of their menu.Here they serve the usual Dim Sum choices (no, they don't have those fancy new creations), but their speciality is the Bo Lo Bun, which is a must try as nowhere else have I tasted such good red pork bread bun.

Came here as invited by daughter on Father's Day. Atmosphere and setting wise, it is not as traditionally grand and comfortable as Din Tai Fung or Dynasty Paradise. The table is a bit of small and cramped and when plates of dim sum flooded the table, you have to eat fast to clear the space in order to accommodate for other dishes. The table seem more suitable for a couple to dine than for a family dinner gathering. The waitresses were many, all very busy running up and down the alley serving the dishes. The business looks labor intensive relying on too many waitresses to serve the customers. High labor costs also means higher operating costs and shifting the cost to the consumer with more expensive food. From the way it operates, it seem more like a fast food restaurant model. The only difference is dim sum served here instead of burger fast food. As such, I think it can operate like Macdonald with food over the counter at cheaper costs. This Dim Sum specialist originated from Hong Kong and does not have a long history. It was established in 2009 by a Hong Kong Chef Mak Kwai Pui and won Michelin Star rating and expanded to other countries like Philippines and Singapore. I don't think it can rely on the labor intensive model in Hong Kong and Philippines to operate using the same model in Singapore. Retail food businesses in Singapore has to automate to be less dependent on low skilled labor especially foreign manpower to run the show. In Hong Kong, the name is associated with the world's cheapest Michelin-Star restaurant but I found it is overpriced here. I had tried Dim Sum in Penang and Melaka. I found the food here above my expectation: refined and tasty and deserves good comments

The dim sum here is average. There is much better dim sum to be found in other establishments at similar prices. Quality is so-so e.g. the prawns in the steamed har kau are not fresh and probably of the frozen type. I find the BBQ pork bun too sweet. Nothing to shout about and not worth a repeat visit
3
Over-rated dim sum at Tim Ho Wan Westgate. Limited selections on menu and prices steep - be prepared to spend S$50 for 2 persons at lunch. The food taste was not as good as the Hong Kong outlets. No more queue at the restaurant as compared to the times when the restaurant first opened at the Westgate Mall

Tim Ho Wan is the franchise from Hong Kong Michelin Star Dim Sum outlet. Their dim sum worth that star, as all what wr have tried taste very nice and perfectly done (Siew Mai, Barbecue Pork Bun, Steamed Egg Cake, Sago, etc.). Services are fast and efficient, pricing is reasonable for the quality that we get. If you want to enjoy dim sum while in Singapore, Tim Ho Wan is definitely one of the best place to have one.

Although rated 1 star Michelin in HK, I believe the expansion and proliferation of outlets do not serve our palate well.At its beginning in Plaza Singapura, I believed that the taste was indeed good and ingredients were fresh.But sad to say, it has now dwindled to normal average run of the mill dim sum offered by Chinese restaurants.The price however still stays affordable
4
Visited this Michelin starred dim sum joint for tea break. Love their baked BBQ pork buns, really good! Their BBQ pork vermicelli roll was equally good, so was the pan fried radish cake!Though price was a bit on the high side, but I felt that it was worth it

Visited on 14/12/2016 with my Mother around 11:30am so was before lunch hour n was not crowded. Ordered,its' signature Baked BBQ Pork Bun,$5.30 for 3,its' skin is crispy,a bit sweet n my mother ate 2 out of 3,hahaha!!! Hong Kong Egg Tart,$4.50 for 3 small tart,hmm!!! Find it just normal not very unique. The Dried Fish & Pork Porridge,$6.80,it has a 'fragrant' taste because of the dried fish. The chee cheong fan with char siew,$5.50,just like Kopitiam selling but its' char siew taste much better. As for the Rice with Chicken & Mushroom,$6.50,find the rice should be more fragrant,might be I get to compare it with Claypot rice ba!!! Dessert,must have its' Osmanthus cake,$3.50 for 3pcs.Overall spend,$41.30 for 2person. Service wise,staff r patient n friendlies for my enquiries on the ingredients. As I temporarily have to restrict my diet on seafood so cannot ordered siew mah,prawn dumpling n many others

Michellon star dimsum restaurant. I order pork congee with century egg and salted egg, beancurd skin and prok rib. Food was excellent especially the pork rib.
Service very fast. Be ready to queue during peak hour.
4
Good service, fast serving of food. Excellent BBQ pork buns which are the best I have tested in my travels to over 20 cities across 5 continents.
4
You order, they come, you eat. Signature buns taste good. Rest of the dim sum is good standard but not extra ordinary. Good dim sum is still good dim sum.
3
This was the first time I ate at the restaurant. It did not quite live up to it's reputation. There was such long queue when they first opened. Have the taste of the food changed? We had one of the highly recomended dish, fried carrot cake. It's good, you can taste the raddish and it melted in your mouth. The chicken feet was stewed and different from other restaurants. The other dishes we ordered were fish ball witg sausage, pork ribs; spinach dumpling and cheong fun were average. Generally the food were salty. Service was very good and efficient
4
Came back here for another helping of siew mai, har kow and pan fried radish cake. The har kow(prawn dumpling) was the most consistent. It tasted the same as the previous visit , "skin" of the dumpling did not stick to the paper - this was a sign of a good har kow. however, the siew mai was salty this time round. One piece of the radish cake was cold. The broccoli with oyster sauce was nice, not too salty and the vegetables were fresh. hit and misses at this eatery..

As an average, working class person- a food fanatic, does not go much into expensive restaurants especially with those that has a Michelin star rating. I have been a fan of Michelin and admire on how they rate the cuisines they try. I have been fortunate to get these buns and dimsum at Tim Ho Wan. Buns have these fillings that would make you forget your name not to mention the buns itself. Crispy and has these heavenly texture. Shrimp dumplings are at its best. I suggest you try the 4 main courses that highlights the best that they can offer. Hands up for these

After so many years after opening up in Singapore I decided to give this place a try when visiting Westgate. With all the long queues at the various branches throughout Singapore that I've come across I was thinking to myself that something must be good about their dim sum. In short, I was disappointed. Apart from one dish, everything else was very average. After all, it seemed like fast food dim sum and the service was very quick. It was not that inexpensive either but like most things that have been commercialized and franchised, the quality isn't what I would wait in line for. Not recommended.

Tim Ho Wan as i recalled when they first came to Singapore versus Tim Ho Wan now, is a whole world of difference! Food and service was tip top then but had taken a sharp dip today. The outlet i went was at Westgate and the queue was short. We had a grandma that had difficulty walking and was told to wait for all members to arrive before we could be given a table. We were just missing my sister who was parking her car. Rules and rules, but i think if the queue is short, there should be some flexibility for old folks. Waitress at the entrance was rude in her words when she denied us a table. I would understand better if she had spoken nicely to us. There was 6 of us and the bill came up to about $100+ which i felt was a tad pricey for the quality we had. 1. Baked bun with barbequed pork (3 pieces) - used to be bigger and wet inside with fillings. The baked buns were now visually smaller, drier on the inside, and also less fillings. Colour also looked darker than the nice light brown as before.2. Lotus steamed rice with pork and mushrooms - used to be wetter too, but drier now on the outside. however this dish is still relatively good to me. flavorful on the inside and will good taste.3. Steamed egg cake - this is still good despite poor presentation. waitress dropped the dish on our table with the steam filter still on the cake.4. Steamed rice rolls with prawns - i thought the taste was a little strange with the vegs added inside. rice rolls was also a little too sticky and hard to cut apart.5. Steamed chicken feet - mum liked this dish but i did not taste it.6. Steamed fresh shrimp dumplings (ha gao) - this was ok, but is very ex at $6.50 for 4 pieces. 7. Siew Mai - was okay too. nothing fantastic.8. Fried carrot cake - this was a little over burnt, had that burnt taste underneath. 9. Fried beancurd skin - was okay, but was dripping with oil. 10. Fried spring roll with crab meat - can give this dish a miss. 11. Century egg porridge - century egg portions were a little stingy, i only had 4 small pieces in mine. Overall, i would rate the entire experience as disappointing considering how i had previously tasted their great standard when it first opened at Plaza Sing. Would not come back unless i couldn't find anywhere else to have dim sum :

We have lunch at tim ho wan westgate today however it was extremely unpleasant. All waitresses are rushing to clear plates including those with food. 1 offer to packet your last bun so that u can quickly clear your table.Another clear food from my kids without asking if she has finished. That was very horrible experience
4
Highly recommended as the meal is delicious and the service is fast. It was not the first time I tried Dim Sum but I was impressed of the quality and great taste of them all.Regarding to the queue we did not have to wait more than 5 minutes as there was an available table for two. It might be possible because we went during the week and not at the weekend where it normally turns out crowded

Tim Ho Wan serves Hong King style dim sum and has a few restaurants in Singapore and Hong Kong. There is always a queue but it's worth the wait. The dim sums are excellent. We tried the ones they are best known for, the pork bun, the Siew Mai and a few others. The mango pomelo dessert is very refreshing.
2
Limited choices, some dishes we either not flavorsome or too salty. For a 1 michelin star restaurant I am gobsmacked. Prices were also around $4-6 per portion. The only plus point of the meal was that their bbq bun had a generous filling inside unlike some others.
3
Visited this restaurant after theHype has slightly died down, the queue for tables still took about 15 minutes.Food was served fast though.Quality of the food leaves much to be desired, prawns in dumpling were of the frozen kind and had a frozen taste, baked char Siew bun was a bit too sweet for my liking
2
Most of their dishes were inferior to those of other outlets like Toa Payoh or Plaza Singapura. Queue used to be very long but I think most people have realized the inferior quality and have moved on to other places. These days, you don't always see the long queue

We like coming here. It serves good old dim sum with an unusual and refreshing twist in the Char Siu Pau. On top of that, it is not easy to find casual eateries serving steamed rice rolls (cheong fun) anymore here in Singapore. Crystal Jade Kitchen has long stopped production of this dish, and please, do not give me the local version with sweet dark black sauce, yuck. Though the menu is rather limited, hence the quick and efficient production and execution of each dish, if you like what they have on the menu, then it's good enough to keep coming back for the same things. I don't understand people's complaints about service being brisk and waiters clearing empty plates. Isn't that what everyone wants - prompt attention? If service is lackadaisical and tardy, people complain. When it's quick, they complain too. Besides, the tables are not that big and with so many dishes that is what dim sum is all about, you'd appreciate them clearing plates to make more room. It's an efficient and well-thought out operation here - at least you get stools to sit on while lining up (Din Tai Fung - shame on you!!), and your order is taken immediately when you sit down, and food arrives in a jiffy. It's not elegant high end restaurant style dining - more like Thai Express, Sushi Tei - with appropriate prices to match

We visited this outlet twice . The first time was ok, as in acceptable food quality and taste. My mom likes the fried fish skin. But on the second visit, the menu had changed. There was fried noodle char siew or something like that . I couldnt eat much. Taste absolutely terrible . My mom and myself can make this 10x better. Was a real let down. Embarassed to bring my family there..... hence its now banned from list of places to eat
2
When we ate there twice, We felt so rushed... The food came.. After we finished it, the plate was cleared almost immediately... It may be a service thing.. But it made us feel rushed, as if they wanted us gone.. Food was below my expectations of a Michelin star restraunt. Food was more oily than normal. Perhaps that's their style.. Not alot of options... I initially thought they had a fee options and did those very well... Not the case in my Asian palate opinion.. Will not visit again.. Ever. Im keen to try their outlet in Hong Kong, but for dim sum, go to Ding Tai Fung. Service is consistently great , and so is the food.

The BBQ buns were really good, 3 servings for SD 5 (pricey but so worth it) Ordered a mean with beef and rice (it was also very good) and warm Barley Drink.The place is very crowded but despite this, the crew is very efficient. Waiters have a tendency to drop in and take your plate when there's no more food left which can seem a bit intruding but since there's a long line for people outside, this gesture is understandable. Wouldn't recommend the place for people who are seeking intimate and quiet places
5
Excellent place for Dim sum lovers! There is nothing on the menu that you will not like. All their food is above par very deserving of their michelin star ratings. This place makes you want to go back for more. What is also surprising is how their menu is reasonably priced. Value for money
2
Queued for more than an hour. Expected Michelin star dim sum. We were disappointed. Nothing special. Beef balls were tasteless and mushy. Only the buns were ok. Will not return.

Went to Tim Ho Wan twice when I was in Singapore. I had passed by the massive queues at Plaza Singapura and wondered what it was all about and then discovered the branch at Westgate!! Have sampled the cheong fun (prawn and BBQ pork), the famous char siew bao, the siew mai, har gau, spinach and prawn dumplings, congee, pan fried turnip cake, glutinous rice, fried fish skin, fried wasabi prawn dumplings, beancurd skin (steamed and fried), and spring rolls. The standout dish for me is the char siew bao - we were feeling so full and were going to takeaway the buns but when we tried it, we couldn't resist - nice and crusty on the top and chewy bread around the BBQ pork. Just heavenly! I also really like the spinach dumplings, esp the thin clear skin on the dumplings. Some of the offerings are slightly different to the usual offerings - for example there was leek in the prawn cheong fun, coriander in the BBQ pork cheong fun and also what looked liked goji berries on the top of the siew mai which influenced the taste. The pork in the century egg congee was also a little fatty for my liking and the fried fish skin was a mistake. All in all, the standard of the dim sum is good and when we have visited in the early evening we haven't had to queue for a seat. The place does feel rushed and the staff do seem to want to clear your plates pronto to get others in. Also the second time we were there they were playing really loud and fast paced music which didn't make for a conducive dining experience. Despite this, it is worth giving this place a go - the standard of the dim sum is of a higher than average standard
4
Arriving at 11.30 on a weekday we didn't have to queue. Fast, if a little impersonal, service. We enjoyed the food and found the textures a little unusual.... My son's beef on rice was quite soft: my congee was very smooth, individual grains not discernible. You may regard that as a negative thing but I thought it was a nice change from Crystal Jade or Din Tai Fung. I would certainly come again but would make sure it was early to avoid the crowds. Have not yet tried the HK branch but will give it a go next time we are there as I would be interested to compare
4
We wanted to find out if the food here is as good as the other Tim Ho Wan we tried and we thoroughly enjoyed it.This is another busy branch but to our luck, when we went there at lunch time, there wasn't any line. (After we were seated, a long line began to form.)We ordered the famous pork buns, dimsums and rice meals and they were all predictably enjoyable. The buns were less brown than what we're used to but they were delicious as well.As expected, the place gets busy and noisy but they still manage to deliver your order quick enough. Most of the diners when we went looked like office workers/executives on lunch breaks (this was on a work day) although we also saw some American tourists waiting in line. The place is really popular.The price is a little above the usual restaurant prices but it's worth it.This one I really like

Having been to Tim Ho Wan 2 weeks ago in IFC Central branch, I can double confirmed this is not up to what you would get in HK not even 80% as the local JV partner mentioned in the press.1. The chicken feet looks pathetic and skinnier than that of HK2. The cheong fun has not taste. period3. Beef ball is soft and mushy4. Chef recommended special dumpling is nothing special and don t look same as in their pictures5. baked char siew pau is too sweet(don t they know now sporeans have their food with less salt and less sugar.6.overall presentation looks dullBesides food quality not being up to expectations, I recalled Mr Mak (the owner chef said the dishes need to be best served one by one at a time so customers can savour the flavours one at a time, here it is all rolled out at breakneck space, almost all within 10-15 minutes hence some of the dishes get cold before you get to them.At S$ 5-6 per dish it is not as cheap as that in HK and the local operator has said rent is higher in Singapore.It doesn' t deserve a Michelin rating here in Singapore and certain reviewers whom have rated it 4-5 stars need to justify their basis, If you are from KL/PJ you know the dim sim place in Damansara Uptown/ DJ is anytime better than this and not even to bring KL hotel restaurants eg Concorde or Mandarin KLCC etc. As for Singaporeans the benchmark can be Crystal Jade, dim sim at the Ritz Carlton or Peach Garden.or the one at Takashimaya 4th floor whom all don t even a Michelin but they are fare better than the Tim Ho Wan here.Mr Mak (the founder) sorry, if you are reading this, please improve your local quality control and send more of your HK chefs here to ensure it matches up to your restaurants in HK. If you are keep some 'kung fu/trade' secrets, then perhaps you should have a different name for your chain here as our expectations are high if based on Tim Ho Wan brand. I won' t come back again even for the famed baked buns. Besides There is many choices in Westgate for other foods. If the quality doesn' t improve, they will not have repeat clients and you will know what your q is less than 10 mins !!

We were party of 6, waiting for 1 more to come, and we weren't allowed to be seated because one more party has not arrived yet. They didn't bother which we were traveling with 3 hungry children that we won't allow to be seated and ordered. After the last person arrived, they had to find a table for us. Restaurant seem crowded, chair wasn't the comfortable one. Food was ok only. The really disturbing thing was, the service staff came very often to clear the plates, glasses even chopsticks even we weren't finished the food yet. We still have few leftover on the plate, they came and asked if we still want the food because they want to clear the plates. We felt like we were chased and we had to gobble up the last bits of our food. While we were still seated, our drinks were cleared up, and we just stood up and left with some food on the plates. Service? No. Food? So so

Apart for the long queue, actually dim sum here quite nice.4 heavenly king deemed to be their all time fave.. char siew pork bun, steamed egg cake, rice vermicelli with pork liver and carrot cake..for my opinion, i like the bun and steamed egg cake so much.. for the bun , the skin sugary and crispy while the char siew inside very tasty. for the steamed cake is so soft..other than that other most favorite item that i always order is the spring roll.. for me the taste just like marshmallow.. very smooth..their chilli also quite special.. think they mixed it with fermented soy bean.. it taste so nice..for my son i also order rice with chicken, sausage, etc.. but it taste so so.. not recommended and also come with very small portionfor dessert we ordered mango sago.. quite nice.

Visited this restaurant after it has been opened for a couple of months. People have been raving about this restaurant and I always see a long queue each time I passed by the restaurant. Today I was determined to see what's the rave about this restaurant.As usual the queue was long though we visited the restaurant at 8pm. Nice gesture of the restaurant to put chairs outside for customers to sit while queueing. After about 15-20min, we were seated. Noticed that the seatings within the restaurant is close to one another and therefore, not much privacy. But this settings is typical of any traditional dim sum restaurant here in Singapore and hk. Ordered braised chicken feet, preserved and salted egg porridge, har gow, siew Mai, beef balls, Chee cheong fun, fried carrot cakes, seafood bean curd skin and char siew bao. Some hits and some misses. The chicken feet was well braised and flavourful; Tender meat on those lovely feet. I find the har gow and siew Mai pretty average. Don't really like the taste of the beef balls as the texture was abit too gooey. The Chee cheong fun was average too. The fried carrot cake was very soft on the inside but tarred slightly on the outside. The seafood bean curd skin and the char siew bao were excellent.Price for 2 including drinks came up to about $55. Average priced by Singapore standards. Not much service for me to talk about as the restaurant was extremely busy
3
Food selection is limited. not much space to walk. I don't understand why the queue is so long on weekend. I queued for ten minutes on my first visit, i don't think it's worth my time waiting. the food is not that fantastic afterall and taking it as a dim sum restaurant, the food selection is really miserable, just the basics and that's it

Visited Tim Ho Wan at Westgate in May 2014 and it is indeed the wait. We went for lunch and as expected, there was a long Q at the restaurant (Do note that the restaurant does not take in reservation and even if you are in the Q and it is ur turn, you can only go to ur seat once everyone at your table has arrived, they do not let you wait for your family/friends at the table). Although there is a long Q, I must say that the staff there are very efficient. We Q up for less than 30 minutes before getting a seat and it is quite fast considering there is at least 40-50 people in the Q.The legendary Baked Bun with BBQ Pork is worth waiting for... it is crispy on the outside and soft inside, filled with delicious BBQ Pork. ($4.50 for 3 pieces). My daughter loves their Steamed Egg Cake (more well known as Ma Lai Gao) and she ate almost one Ma Lai Gao on her own on top of the Baked Bun plus other things ($ 3.80 per piece for Steamed Egg Cake).However, other than the famous Baked Bun, Steamed Egg Cake and probably a few more dim sum (Spring Roll With Egg White- $4.20 for 3 , Pork Dumpling with Shrimp-$5 for 4) that tasted great, the rest of the dim sum is so so only. Having said that, i will definitely come back for more Baked Bun and Steamed Egg Cake as they are really nice!!!!More details @ http://sloopoo83.blogspot.sg/2014/05/weekend-when-grandparents-came-for-visit.htm
