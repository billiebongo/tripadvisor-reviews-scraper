Nice concept- fresh salads creatively mixed at reasonable prices. Good option if in this area for lunch

Only had a to-go salad (which they had in their chiller), the one with the wagyu beef. While not the cheapest salad ever, but it was pretty good and hearty for the price. If I were to go back I would probably have customised it more cos there some ingredients I could do without. I wouldn't mind going back, but only if it wasn't just in Millennia Walk as I'm not there really often
