Cozy cafe with great waffles, tiramisu & coffee.. The original tiramisu was "just right" without being overly sweet.. Highly recommended!
2
This is just a normal and very noisy cafe. Only a couple of tiramisu items on the menu. Staff were very unwelcoming.
3
Felt that this lacked punch and flavour, it was decent though. Not a fan of their flavoured tiramisu.
4
Had breakfast in this lovely place..they serve breakfast all day so you don't have to get up early! European choice of food in combination with coffee or tea. Must try is their TIRAMISU which they have in different flavours!
5
Whether one had a salad or a pancake with chicken breast, it was mouth-watering from start to finish. Best tiramisu I've had besides home made. Cute venue and smiling waitress. Pricing wasn't too bad either.

Went here yesterday with couple of friends, cafe was always full with customers. Cute decorations on the wall for selfies. I ordered the super mini but cute tiramisu which came out okay with that price. Wifi was super fast too. Worth to go
5
Nice for a light dessert. The tiramisu is a bit booze which is great. The sweetness is cut perfectly with strong and flavorful coffee. They do it perfectly in cute cat cups.

@TheKuoKnowsI used to think that tiramisu was just sponge cake soaked in espresso coffee with mascarpone and egg yolks.How wrong could I be. And a big thank you to The Tiramisu Hero for showing me the error of my ways. I could not believe that there are umpteen different flavours to choose from. While the Yuzoo Tiramisu is outstanding, the Durian Tiramisu is out of this world. It's one step beyond excellent. There are lots more at The Tiramisu Hero besides the famous Italian dessert. But that will have to wait for another visit.Well done The Tiramusu Hero! Stand up and take a bow

This is my first time visiting this restaurant. This restaurant is a few minutes walk from Lavender MRT station ( green line ). The environment of this restaurant is great and it is perfect for chilling up with friends. The price of the tiramisu is quite value for money. My friends and I ordered the oreo tiramisu. The tiramisu comes with a small cute fancy bottle. Besides that, the tiramisu also taste delicious. Next, we also ordered some fries. The fries are really good as the fries are very tasty. The restaurant staff is friendly and they provide a good service. I would like to visit this restaurant again in the future for more good food

Had been to this place 3 years ago, tried it's original and Milo tiramisu, tasty and good. Yesterday back again for afternoon high tea, ordered a durian tiramisu and salted egg fries. The serving of the food is a bit slow for the fries though, nevertheless the food is good. Durian tiramisu especially, simply delicious. The location of the cafe is on jalan besar, it is hard to find a parking lot and neither near any mrt, a long walk is expected. The food however is good and price is average. Highly recommended and definitely will be back to try on other tiramisu
4
Came on a Saturday evening. The service is warm and brisk.
The cups are cute and there are word puzzles for kids to doodle and keep occupied.
We had hot latte and honey lemon and the snack platter to share.
5
The place is awesome, food really good and tasty! It's not cheap nor expensive. I will go back there for sure
4
The quality of tiramisu is good ad the selection of pastas and salad are excellent.
I love the little souvenir corner that sells very unique items like notebooks,umbrella and t shirts.
4
Love the latte n the cute theme n cozy settings. Yummy food. Great coffee. Good place for meeting up with friends too. Friendly staffs.
4
Serving a good variety of tiramisu served in jars, this is a cute cafe that draws a crowd with its unique decor and own merchandise which are cool souvenirs for visitors.
4
Used to leave nearby and come for coffe. Nice service and nice food. The decor is also nice. Favorite is the fish and chips

was my 2nd time at this funky cafe opened by a local influencer. exterior of the cafe was stunning, a overhead board of Sir Antonio ( mascot of the cafe ), artificial grass lawn and a few tables. it does get sunny, suggest to sit inside the cafe on sunny days except night time.the interior was cosy! Sir Antonio was all around the cafe! even the toilet is beautifully constructed with cat concepts! although there was no cats around, it certainly feels you are dining over a hot Sir Antonio mug in a cat's crib.be sure to try the Tiramisu! the glass bottles can be brought home! don't forget to take a picture of you in Sir Antonio's mascot head at the entrance! do whatever pose you like! no one's gonna laugh!there are merchandises at the front counter. you can even buy Sir Antonio's mug which they serve hot latte in. the service charge is the only sting in the pocket for me, just my 2 cents but overall, a definite place to come to even for locals

Cat-lovers note - this is a place for you (though there weren't any cats around, collections are taken to help the strays)OK, now the review:The place is a little hard to find unless you take reference from the Jalan Besar Stadium (you may park in the multi-storey carpark there, if you are driving) and the next-door beer place (which name I've forgotten :P ) Same road as Chye Seng Huat Hardware (the coffee place). It *is* along the main road, but the colours of the place blend in a little.There is also cat-themed merchandising in-store.The place is airconditioned, and the music is not too loud that it prevents polite conversation. Service is attentive, and friendly. Seats are comfy, with a single sofa-table combo and the general cafe seating you normally find. There is outside seating as well, for those who prefer the 'roadside stall' experience.Food is very nice - the tiramisu comes in mini, momma and poppa sizes (single, 1-2, and 2-4) and the momma is a good size for two, coming in a little mason jar. The tiramisu we ordered (DURIAN and coffee!) was delicious, but one bugbear was that the lowest sponge finger layer was not 'soaked' thoroughly, if at all, by the mascapone/durian mix.The Belgian Waffles were a a hit with our palates and tummies.The Baileys Choc Mailkshake could be a bit thicker/milkshakey - it was only the consistency of mushroom soup. A bit of a disappointment, that, but perhaps the alcohol content prevented a more frothy mix - must try the other shakes to check this out.We loved the privacy, despite being seated right next to other diners. A good place to visit, and a definite 'come again' location for us

Loved the extensive menu and the cat/ tiramisu decor. There was so much to choose from, but we went for the Sir Antonio Mega breakfast, with eggs, two kinds of sausages, potato puffs, bread.... it was absolutely massive, and could not have been finished if we tried, so were sadly too full to try the famous tiramisu. :(Sadly the service was quite strange, there seemed to be quite a few waitresses on shift but they seemed to want to walk around rather than take away plates or answer any questions, one in particular seemed quite surly, and there were a few lost in translation moments. Nice cafe, but left an after-taste of pretention
4
Affordable price for cute tiramisus. The whole cafÃ© is filled with cute decoration and there is an outdoor sitting area which is nice for cool days and evenings.There is a lot of different perfumes and some are better than others (try the Original and Strawberries but avoid Chocolate).They also serve all kind of lunch and breakfast food.Located just in front of a small hawker center so I would recommend to pop by for a nice desert
4
I only bought the original tiramisu to take away, and loved the texture and taste - the bitterness from the coffee and the smooth sweetness from the mascarpone cheese. Expensive though it may be for a small glass container, but it was worth it!
3
Original (has taint of alcohol) and Oreos tiramisu are their recommendations. My creme brûlée coffee is pretty nice too. Staffs are friendly.
Only disappointment is their lava cake; weak presentation and cake is a little hard.
5
We love the chocolate lave cake
We love the tiramisu cake
We love the place
We love the service
I think this one didn't fail us at all.
3
I love their durian tiramisu, but really can't have it too often ($9 each). Lunch there is acceptable, though the slow service makes it hard for us office folks to complete lunch on time. Nonetheless, with improvement (as we did give feedback) hopefully there will be improvement :

The Tiramisu Hero is a cat themed cafe, so the combination of cats and dessert is perfect! The ambiance is light and fun, so a great place to catch up with friends.The food is just about average. Between three of us, we had a Pasta Salad, Truffle Fries, Mushroom Agli Olio, and a Regular Tiramisu. We'd initially ordered a Salted Egg Pasta as well, which we landed up sending back because the sauce tasted incredibly raw and grainy. The Truffle Fries were the only stand out. Even the Tiramisu was fairly average
3
Personally, the taste of tiramisu is all right. It is not the best I have tasted but definitely above average.The good thing is they serve a variety of tiramisu. Besides the original flavour, there is strawberry flavour, matcha flavour, Bailey etc to suit different taste buds.However the size is rather small. We ordered medium size and was quite shocked cause it's pretty tiny , definitely not enough for 1-2 person as stated on the menu. Hence the price is considered pricey considering the size.The coffee is good though, I love it.The restaurant do serve western food as well but I did not try as I had my lunch before popping over for desserts
4
Lovely little place a few steps aways from the hotel we were staying. We were quite hungry after a long journey and my partner didn't feel like queing up in one of the local eateries when we spotted this strange place.The food they serve is very nice: breakfast all day but also salads and first courses. It's Italian style but, being Italian, I didn't dare try the pasta :)The place was full of locals, probably working at big companies and having their lunch break. Wifi is free. And if your phone's battery is low you can easily plug it in and recharge.Food is very tasty, but desserts are definitely W O N D E R F U L!I would love to have such a nice place close to home so that I could indulge in such precious sweets everyday!The setting is very nice, with images and statues of a black and white cat everywhere

This place is open daily unlike many of the hipster cafes in the neighbourhood.Its risotto is nice, both mushroom spinach and seafood. Serving size is medium.It has a large variety of tiramisu and all of them are good. Just try everything and decide on your favourite.However like many of the cafes in the neighbourhood the kitchen is probably understaffed. My risotto took more than half hour tonight. Not the first time as I am a regular
3
Ordered truffle fries and salted egg yolk fries. Both were pretty good for their price and the salted egg yolk fries were loaded with salted egg yolk. However the service was pretty meh as the waitress seemed to be rushing us when taking our orders and they forgot our drinks. We waited for about an hour before asking them and they said that they forgot our orders. Tiramisu a little overpriced for what it is.
5
We've been staying in the Yan Hotel a couple of steps down the road and we were looking for a nice place to have breakfast. The Tiramisu Hero is really a very nice place to drink your coffee, enjoy some "Skinny Love" yogurt breakfast, or eat a delicious homemade tiramisu. Lots of love everywhere, the interior design is funny (anyone into cats?), the tiramisu was delicious (have I mentioned that before?), the coffee was quite alright as well, and they also sell some hipster gear. Perfect place to spend some 30 minutes before you head into office or spend the day as a Singapore tourist. Thumbs up!
3
Quite underwhelmed by the tiramisu here. Yes, the options sound great, and you can't leave without trying one, but it won't be the greatest thing you've ever had!
1
Did not live up to it's namesake. pls do not attempt to try and check it out unless u really want to waste money and calories. Terrible exhaust system indoor. plenty of smoker outdoor. not good for family with kids.
4
The ambient was great, accompanied with great X'mas song surround.
The food was great especially the agio alio, "big breakfast", as well as waffle after that.
Price are affordable and reasonable.
3
A friendly place on a friendly street with nice ambiance, this is surely a fun place to hang out. I tried the Cold Truffle and Salmon Pasta which had the portion size matching that of a very high-end Italian restaurant, i.e. tiny (served in a plate 3x the size). Taste-wise, the pasta was average and the quantity seemed too small for the price. Also ordered an Oreo Milk Shake which was also very underwhelming. Just seems like sweetened milk blended with Oreo cookies which one can easily churn at home. They have a number of Tiramisu flavours to choose from and I took away the Chocolate one. They can be kept refrigerated for 3-5 days. The tiramisu, however was also pretty average which is sad considering what the restaurant is called- This tiramisu was surely no hero. No complaints about the service- fairly decent
3
Overall, I would say this place is okayish , but definitely not as sensational as the reviews may let you think. I initially came to this place to enjoy a tiramisu, well what they serve you is not bad but it is not tiramisu, not at all. I was a little bit disappointed on this matter. Regarding the food it is okay, they are fast to serve you and the pasta I order were good. The quinoa salad however was disappointing... Mostly salad, not much quinoa

I was surprised to find such a good tiramisu shop at neighbourhood area and my girlfriend told me that it has been there more than 3 years ago. It is really hidden gem but apparently a lot of youngsters were hanging there. I love their decoration and fixtures. It made me feel cosy and relax at a corner. My girlfriend had strongly recommended milo tiramisu is very nice but unfortunately it was sold out :(The staff had recommended the chocolate tiramisu instead. We also had waffles and 2 scoops of chocolate ice cream. This was how we spent our day after steamboat dinner.You can consider to try a new stall of steamboat called 'Emperor Pot' at 100 Tyrwhitt, beside Jalan Besar Stadium after dessert or before dessert. Your choice with other option

Saw this place at night when my friend and I were on the way back to the hotel. It looks cute from outside and very crowded, as it was really late and we were too sleepy, we decided to have breakfast the next day here. The place indeed is very cute and cosy. The drawings of Sir Antonio (the main cat) are on the wall and ceilings. The servers are friendly too!I ordered piccolo latte and it came in a very cute cat mug and my friend ordered long black. We shared the mega breakfast, and lucky that we decided to share it, as the portion is really big. Bacons, egg, very chewy yummy bread, sausages, salads and fried potatoes are in the mega breakfast. The price and portion are really worth it. We didn't try the tiramisu because we were very full but we did tried the chocolate tester and yum, the chocolate with dried strawberry tastes good. We'll definitely coming back to this place again and we'll try the main food
5
If you want to try the ambiance of cute and comfortable cafe with delicious chocolate lava cake, this is a must place you should visit! Located in the small street near Hamilton but I'm sure you could find it because there is a sign on it. Love the decorations, with black and white cat hanging on the wall. They also prepare the pencil color for you to coloring. The less thing is not many option for menu. But if you like desserts especially chocolate then this is the best place to spent your quality time
5
Full of tiramisu for the love of TIRA ! Best recommendation is the matcha tira! The outdoor seats are not to be missed ! If u love the glass jar, u can ask the staff to wash it for u after have finish ur tira, and bring it home ^^ The toilet is another place not to be missed! The decoration of it makes business better
3
Decided to visit this place as I wanted to try tiramisu.With the name given to the place, I guessed one of the specialities will be tiramisu. Ordered the original version. The presentation was cute as the tiramisu was placed inside a jar. The tiramisu tasted average, nothing spectacular (but do bear in mind, there is no one fix way to prepare tiramisu? I did not try the other flavours too). I ordered an iced mocha latte. The coffee tasted normal and light. There is outdoor and indoor seats. The decoration of the cafe is cute. They sell cat related merchandise too. There are carpark lots around the area. The staffs are pretty friendly and attentive
4
Really efficient service and helpful staff. Personally had risotto (good!) and friend had the mega breakfast, which was all day and worth the money. Liked the ambience, will be back for dessert and drinks.
5
Love the design of the cafe, and also the menu, everything is so nicely drawn. Only tried the french toast and tiramisu in the jar, it was delicious! Great place to hang out the whole afternoon and just indulge in the space and atmosphere.
4
Had the plain waffle and chocolate lava cake. Both were really good. Would definitely recommend. Service was efficient as well.
4
Went there for a drink and found the deco to be interesting.
The staff is friendly and ready to assist customers.
This cafe is really unique and they even have merchandise like T-Shirt for sale.
4
The ambience is quite cosy. We ordered the original, lemon lavender and baileys tiramisu. My favorite choice is the original. Baileys tiramisu is not up to expectation though. Lemon lavender has a fresh, unique taste. However, staffs were not very friendly. But it is still worth a visi
5
Ate breakfast here on a recent holiday whilst staying at a hotel nearby.Food was amazing, the cafe was really trendy. Had a creme brulee latte, the best coffee I've ever had! It's to die for, must try! Prices are listed on their website. Not too badly priced, on par for Singapore. (we spent approx $60 for 2)
5
Got to know this place through my girl. Indeed it did not disappoint us, a great place for brunch.The place is a bit small but the foods were great. Especially the cake in the jar was great. For kids they will loved the Oreo.Their curry baked rice was tasty and nice. Mega breakfast a big portion where you can share. Whereas for the fun fun bun the portion was very small. A Burger that you can finish just in one bit. But it was nice and tasty.Good for a gathering just coffee and cake. Love it

Having been to The Tiramisu Hero for brunch once, I decided to give it another go today, since *Charmaine picked it anyway (out of all the cafes here in Lavender area). It was still every bit as pretty, and there are still these adorable accessories for sale.We were very full from our lunch, but girls being girls - merely ordering just a pot of hot tea just wasn't enough (initially that was our agreement - just a tea or coffee). *Charmaine had the Tiramisu (SGD$7.50) in a jar, original flavor. She commented that it tasted merely like "chocolate and cream" at first bite, but then commented that the flavor grew on her as she continued to progress through her dessert.I decided to go for the Tiramisu (SGD$7.50) in a jar - the strawberry flavor. As usual, there was no detected coffee aroma, just sweet cream and strawberries (I felt like I was eating S&C literally), though the texture was light and fluffy, lovely in its own right. I just wouldnt consider this a tiramisu place.They also have these amazing pre-mix Hot Chocolate with Marshmallows (SGD$4.80) goodies for takeaways - all one needs to do is to add hot water or milk to enjoy a delicious cup of hot chocolate. *Charmaine bought a couple to try - I shall ask for her review soon.For full review and more photos, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/11/dessert-at-tiramisu-hero-cafe-revisit.htm

Had gone with a friend as it was in her 'hood! Didn't try the tiramisu as we were actually pretty stuffed from lunch. Ordered some iced drinks - was a little annoying that a few of their desserts and drinks were not available. Anyways we settled for a waffle with ice cream to share. It was surprisingly good - waffle warm and crisp on the outside, went well with the ice cream. Prices are a little steep but the place has a lovely ambience. I love the decor of the place, it's a little quirky and different and love the cat head thingy you can take a pic with. Perhaps I should try going back at some point to try the tiramisu when I am next in Singapore

Tried this cafe even though we have already read some bad reviews and we can say that there really is some more room for improvement for this blooming cafe. First, the cleanliness. It really bothers us that the floor near tables 1-3 is dirty. There was a pool of water on the walkway wherein people going to kitchen passes thru but none of the staff bothers to clean even though we've noticed that one staff just stands near to it and she just keeps on serving free water. And since we were placed on table 1 (though we don't know why since there are so many other tables for 2 that are not yet occupied wherein customers will feel more comfortable and not isolated and because of this we never fully appreciate the design of the cafe) we have to endure this messy flooring. For the food, we've ordered ham&cheese wrap and Hero fun bun which took forever to come. Creme brûlée latte and iced mint latte. We've also tried the original and chocolate tiramisu.The serving is quite small for the price, the creme brûlée is rather bland but the tiramisu is just nice for my taste. All in all it's an average cafe with a lot of potential if they could just improve more on the taste of food they serve. Oh, and when you walk thru the entrance door there is a small trinket shop and Sir Antonio's head that is great for photo op.
